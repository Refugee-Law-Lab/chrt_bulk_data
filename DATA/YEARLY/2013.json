Background. 1\nII........... Subpoena Duces Tecum.. 3\nIII......... Request for Further Particulars. 5\n[1] Ms. Leslie Palm (the Complainant) claims the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 (the ILWU or the Union) has discriminated and harassed her on the basis of her sex, pursuant to sections 9, 10 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985,\nc. H-6 (the Act). The Complainant also claims that Mr. Cliff Willicome and Mr. Richard Wilkinson have harassed her on the basis of her sex in contravention of section 14 of the Act (the Union, Mr. Willicome and Mr. Wilkinson are herein collectively referred to as the Respondents).\n[2] The following ruling deals with a request by the Respondents for a subpoena duces tecum and for further particulars.\nI. Background [3] The Complainant claims the alleged discriminatory conduct affected her well-being, and the remedy she seeks from the Tribunal includes: $712.64 for medication; $56,029.15 in lost wages; $28,117.98 for consultants; and, $20,000 for pain and suffering. In her list of relevant documents in support of her complaints, the Complainant claimed privilege over \u201cmedical notes\u201d and \u201cfinancial notes\u201d. By way of motion, the Respondents sought documentary disclosure from the Complainant with regard to her medical and financial claims. In this regard, in a ruling dated May 24, 2012, the Tribunal ordered:\n1. Ms. Palm is to produce a list to the Respondents containing the names and addresses of all health care professionals she has attended for reason of symptoms or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia or any other health problems for which she is attributing blame to the Respondents. Production to the Respondents shall be completed no later than 6 weeks from the date of this decision.\n2. Ms. Palm is to obtain and produce to the Respondents any medical documents, including any clinical study notes, opinions, consultation reports, analysis, test results, laboratory examination results, and any other information whether in hard copy or electronic format, in the health care professionals\u2019 possession or control, that relates to any symptoms of or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, insomnia, or any other health problem identified by the Complainant for which she is attributing blame to the Respondents. Production to the Respondents shall be completed no later than 6 weeks from the date of this decision.\n3. To protect Ms. Palm's right to confidentiality of her medical records, the documents shall be disclosed to counsel for the Respondents and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to Ms. Palm. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry and the documents must be returned to the Complainant at the conclusion of the inquiry.\n4. Ms. Palm is to produce to the Respondents any documents in her possession that relate to her claims for wage loss, medication, consultant\u2019s expenses, or pain and suffering. Production to the Respondents shall be completed no later than 6 weeks from the date of this decision.\n(Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2012 CHRT 11 at para. 19 [Palm])\n[4] The Complainant did not comply with the Tribunal\u2019s May 24, 2012 order.\n[5] The Tribunal convened a Case Management Conference Call on September 24, 2012 to discuss the issue. The Complainant explained that she was unable to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s May 24, 2012 order because she was busy with other matters occurring in her life and she and her doctors were unclear as to the requirements of the order. The Tribunal clarified the requirements of orders 1, 2 and 4 above, and the Complainant acknowledged her understanding of what was required of her. The Complainant indicated that she would be able to fully satisfy and comply with the orders and provide the required disclosure directly to the Respondents\u2019 counsel by October 9, 2012.\n[6] On October 9, 2012, the Complainant produced documents to the Respondents\u2019 counsel pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s May 24, 2012 order. In her covering letter accompanying the documents, the Complainant wrote:\nPlease find enclosed my medical information I was able to obtain along with my update financials.\nIn regards to the clinical notes you have requested from my psychologist, [\u2026] after consultation and review of my signed confidentiality agreement the clinical notes were not provided to me.\n[7] On October 11, 2012, the Respondents made an application for a subpoena duces tecum for the Complainant\u2019s doctors to appear and produce documents before the Tribunal. According to the Respondents, while the Complainant provided some medical documents, she did not comply with the Tribunal\u2019s May 24, 2012 order. The Respondents also request further particulars regarding the Complainant\u2019s \u201cconsultant\u201d expenses.\nII. Subpoena Duces Tecum [8] According to the Respondents, while the Complainant has identified the names and addresses of three doctors in relation to the allegations in her complaint (Drs. Mehraein, Fung and Schultz), she has only provided documents from one doctor\u2019s file (Dr. Mehraein). Therefore, the Respondents are concerned they have not received all relevant documents pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s May 24, 2012 order. The Respondents add, Dr. Mehraein\u2019s file includes an\nAugust 2, 2012 list of \u201ccurrent concerns\u201d, which includes \u201cdepression\u201d, but the disclosed notes in the file end on March 3, 2011, which I understand the Respondents to be implying that disclosure of Dr. Mehraein\u2019s relevant records was not complete. The Respondents also indicate that Dr. Mehraein\u2019s notes say that he will provide a return to work note (April 2, 2009), but no such note was disclosed. Since the Complainant has not complied with the Tribunal\u2019s\nMay 24, 2012 order, the Respondents request the Tribunal issue a subpoena duces tecum for the doctors to appear and produce documents.\n[9] According to the Complainant, she has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s order and has disclosed the required medical documentation. As explained in her October 9, 2012 cover letter, medical documentation from Dr. Schultz was not provided to her because of a confidentiality agreement. The Complainant has no objection to the issuance of a subpoena in this regard. The Complainant also has no objection to the issuance of a subpoena for the files of Dr. Fung, although she claims to have already provided all relevant documents in this regard to the Respondents. With regard to the return to work note referred to by the Respondents, the Complainant claims that the medical file provided to the Respondents indicates the note was not provided to her as further information was required.\n[10] The purpose of a subpoena duces tecum is to summon a witness to appear before the Tribunal and produce documents that they have in their possession. Pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(3)(a) of the Act, the Tribunal may, in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record, compel witnesses to produce any documents and things that the Tribunal considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint. To be necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint, there must be a nexus between the information or documents sought and the issues in dispute. In Palm, I determined that the Complainant had put her health in issue in this case and that relevant medical information should be produced to allow the Respondents to properly respond to the allegations regarding the effects of the alleged discrimination on the Complainant\u2019s well being (see Palm at paras. 13 and 19).\n[11] Given that the Complainant was unable to obtain her medical records from Dr. Schultz, a subpoena would appear to be the only way to compel the disclosure of these relevant documents. Furthermore, as the Complainant does not object to the issuance of a subpoena for the documents of Drs. Mehraein and Fung, I believe proceeding in this manner will ensure that all relevant documents have been disclosed and will allow the parties to move beyond the disclosure stage of these proceedings.\n[12] Therefore, the Tribunal will issue subpoena duces tecum to each of Drs. Mehraein, Fung and Schultz to appear before the Tribunal and to bring with them and produce to the Respondents the following documents:\nAny medical documents regarding Ms. Leslie Palm, including any clinical study notes, opinions, consultation reports, analysis, test results, laboratory examination results, and any other information, whether in hard copy or electronic format, that relate to any symptoms of or treatment for anxiety, depression, stress, or insomnia.\n[13] To protect the confidentiality of the medical records, the documents shall be disclosed to the Complainant and counsel for the Respondents only and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry and the documents must be returned to the respective doctor who disclosed them at the conclusion of the inquiry.\n[14] A case management conference call will be convened to determine a mutually agreeable date for the doctors to appear before the Tribunal and to discuss the other details of the subpoena.\n[15] Once the subpoenas are issued, the Tribunal encourages the Respondents to attempt to obtain the medical documents informally, without requiring the doctors to appear before the Tribunal. This would save the parties, the Tribunal and the doctors the additional expenditure of time and resources in convening a hearing and would allow these proceedings to move along more expeditiously.\nIII. Request for Further Particulars [16] Pursuant to order 4 above, the Respondents claim that the Complainant did not provide any documents regarding her medication expenses. The Respondents add, the Complainant provided an updated financial claim sheet as part of her disclosure, which now includes an increased claim of $35,598.06 for \u201cconsultants\u201d (as opposed to the previous claim of $28,117.98). Although the Complainant disclosed some invoices from law firms and consultants, she redacted the description of services provided. According to the Respondents, the Complainant has still not particularized why she hired the law firms and other consultants and how those expenses are connected to her current complaint. Therefore, the Respondents request an order for further particulars about the Complainant\u2019s \u201cconsultant\u201d expenses claim.\n[17] With regard to her medication claims, the Complainant submitted that she is awaiting a printout. For the consultant expenses, she submits that she has provided the relevant invoices and statements. The Complainant adds, all invoices and statements from lawyers and consultants are direct charges resulting from this human rights complaint, as stated on the invoices. Specifically, the Complainant states: \u201cThese expenses were incurred navigating through this complaint and ongoing process\u2026\u201d. According to the Complainant, the updated financial claim includes charges to date, which will continue to rise as the proceedings are ongoing.\n[18] In Palm, I found documents in the possession of the Complainant with regard to her claims for mediation and consultant expenses were relevant and should be disclosed (Palm at paras. 15). An order was made in this regard (Palm at para. 19). While the Complainant has yet to produce documents in relation to her medication expense claim, she has indicated that the documentation is forthcoming. Given the Complainant\u2019s undertaking, I will give her until February 1, 2013 to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s previous order. However, I emphasize that the time limits set by the Tribunal are peremptory (Rule 1(5) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)), and if a document is not disclosed and produced, it may not be introduced into evidence at the hearing (Rule 9(3)(c) of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)), without leave of the Tribunal. To put it another way, should the Complainant fail to provide adequate disclosure, she runs the risk of the Tribunal not accepting such evidence at the hearing.\n[19] With regard to the consultant expenses, in response to the current request for further particulars, the Complainant has explained why she hired the law firms and other consultants and how those expenses are connected to her current complaint. However, she has not explained why portions of the invoices and statements she disclosed are redacted. Nor has she claimed any sort of confidentiality or privilege associated with these documents. Therefore, I order the Complainant to produce unredacted copies of invoices and statements related to her claim for consultant expenses; or, in the alternative, provide an explanation for the redactions. The Complainant is to comply with this order by February 1, 2013.\n[20] Insofar as this disclosure request may be seeking invoices from lawyers for legal expenses, I would direct the parties to the decision of Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 [Mowat][1], wherein the Supreme Court of Canada stated the following:\nIn our view, the text, context and purpose of the legislation clearly show that there is no authority in the Tribunal to award legal costs\u2026\n(Mowat at para. 64)\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nActing Chairperson\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 2, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210, T1627\/17310\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Palm v.

The Tribunal has considered the parties\u2019 requests in this regard and hereby amends paragraphs 15 to 17 of the Ruling. These paragraphs now read:\n[15] At the time the party files information it designates as confidential, it must provide the document to the Complainant, the Commission and their counsel along with an explanation of how the information falls into a category of information listed above. The party must provide a detailed rationale to explain why the disclosure of the information is not in the public interest.\n[16] Documents containing information designated as confidential shall be filed separately and clearly marked as confidential. Documents designated confidential shall be disclosed to the Complainant, the Respondent, their counsel, and Commission counsel only and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal. A party who wishes to discuss a document or information that has been designated as confidential during the hearing shall advise of its intent to the Tribunal at which point the Tribunal will decide whether or not to exercise its discretion pursuant to section 52 of the Act and conduct this discussion in camera.\n[17] Confidential documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry. Should any of the parties wish to disclose or make use of any portion of documents designated as confidential at any public hearing, it will indicate the portions thereof and adopt the procedure set out in paragraph 16 of the present ruling. Confidential designation of documents made by the Tribunal continues in effect until the Tribunal orders otherwise, including for the duration of any judicial review and\/or appeal of the proceedings and after final judgment.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada) case which NFB was authorized to film.\n[2] NFB found that the Tribunal\u2019s sound system was insufficient to permit appropriate recording. NFB therefore installed an additional microphone to make up for non-functioning microphones. The next day, February 25, 2013, NFB\u2019s technician, Glenn Hodgins, having read all of the Tribunal\u2019s equipment online manuals, arrived at the Tribunal early to work with the sound technician to get usable sound. At 9:25 the same day, the Tribunal\u2019s sound technician stated that the equipment was broken and needed repair. Mr. Hodgins therefore placed, in plain view, wireless microphones in front of the witness box, the Panel Chair\u2019s seat and in front of three counsel tables to be able to adequately hear and record the proceedings in the event of a malfunction of the Tribunal\u2019s sound system. At 9:35, just as the Tribunal commenced the hearing, the sound started to work and as the feed was clean, the wireless microphones were not used to record the hearing.\n[3] On the afternoon of February 26, 2013, a number of the counsel present raised concerns regarding the direction of the cameras, which had been aimed at their tables during the breaks, and the possibility that their conversations had been filmed, raising a potential privilege breach.\n[4] In the evening of Tuesday, February 26, 2013, it was brought to the attention of the Panel Chair that the microphones installed by NFB had been recording at all times, raising another potential privilege breach.\n[5] On the morning of February 27, 2013, the Panel Chair ordered the removal of NFB\u2019s wireless microphones; such removal was done within the hour following the Panel Chair\u2019s request. The Panel Chair then met with the parties in Chambers and informed them of the potential privilege breach due to the fact that the microphones installed by NFB had been recording at all times. Parties were asked for their views on the matter. Parties suggested that the NFB be ordered to destroy the first two days of recording to remedy any potential privilege breach.\n[6] Following consultations with the parties, the Tribunal issued an oral ruling ordering NFB to refrain from filming during breaks and to refrain from using the first two days of film until further notice. The Panel Chair subsequently met with NFB to seek further clarification on the circumstances surrounding the potential privilege breach with particular attention to the technical dimensions. The Tribunal requested that NFB detail its version of the events in writing and provide a copy to the Tribunal.\n[7] Later that evening, the Panel Chair received information from Mr. Hodgins, in writing, that not only clarified the events but also confirmed that a misunderstanding had occurred. The morning of March 1st, 2013, the Tribunal also received a letter from NFB\u2019s Business Affairs and Legal Services office, further elucidating the circumstances surrounding the events raised in this ruling.\n[8] The Tribunal provided a copy of the letter to the parties during the lunch break and that evening, the Panel Chair met again with the parties in Chambers to discuss what appeared to have been a miscommunication and misunderstanding of events. The Panel Chair expressed that she wished to reflect on NFB\u2019s clarification of events and informed parties that, if needed, she would seek further clarification before rendering a ruling.\n[9] At all material times, NFB acted in good faith and accepted to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s direction.\n[10] In balancing the parties\u2019 fundamental right to protect privileged information and NFB\u2019s objectives; I order the following:\n[11] From the evidence gathered, it appears that certain conversations between counsel may have been captured on camera; NFB is therefore ordered to destroy any exchange between counsel taking place at their respective tables or elsewhere, during breaks and during the hearing, that have been captured on film on February 25 and 26, 2013.\n[12] The evidence does not suggest that conversations were recorded at all times. However, to ensure that no privilege is breached, the Tribunal orders NFB to destroy any other collateral voice sound recordings of conversations that are not part of the case. What is considered to be part of the case includes, for example: the opening statements, the witness\u2019s testimony, counsel asking questions to a witness or addressing the bench, the Panel asking questions or giving instructions, the registry officer giving instructions, administering the oath and receiving evidence. Discussions amongst panel members or amongst counsel are not considered to be part of the public case and any recording of these discussions must be destroyed. This order will apply to the February 25-26, 2013, hearing days.\n[13] In the unlikely event that isolating the different sound recordings is not possible, the Tribunal orders NFB to destroy the entire two days of filming that were recorded on February 25, 2013, and February 26, 2013. NFB may, however, use all recordings such as interviews that took place outside of the hearing room in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s guidelines.\n[14] The Tribunal orders NFB to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s existing media guidelines and any further guidelines issued by the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon on behalf of the Panel\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nApril 24, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1340\/7008\nStyle of Cause: First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v.

Conclusion. 26\nI. Complaint & Motion [1] On June 7, 2007, Diane Carolyn Emmett, the Complainant, filed a complaint under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], against Canada Revenue Agency (\u201cCRA\u201d), the Respondent.\n[2] Essentially, the Complainant alleges the Respondent deprived her of employment opportunities granted to her male and younger colleagues, pursuant to section 7 of the Act; and, that this is reflective of a pattern of systemic discrimination, pursuant to section 10 of the Act.\n[3] The Complainant also filed two additional complaints alleging retaliation by the Respondent for having filed her initial complaint, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act. The second complaint was filed on March 5, 2008 covering the time period from September 10, 2007 and ongoing. The third complaint was filed on February 5, 2009 covering the time period from July 2008 and ongoing.\n[4] On August 25, 2011, the complaint under section 7 and 10 of the Act was referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) for further inquiry. The Commission did not request an inquiry into the two additional complaints of retaliation.\n[5] During a pre-hearing case management conference call held on October 10, 2012, the Respondent\u2019s counsel informed the parties of her intention to file, at the beginning of the coming hearing into the merits of the complaint, a Motion to strike portions of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d).\n[6] It was then agreed that written submissions would be filed and that each party would be given the opportunity to make oral submission on the first day of the hearing.\n[7] On December 21, 2012, the Respondent submitted its Motion to strike some allegations of the Complainant\u2019s SOP. In particular, the Respondent requests:\n1. An order striking from the Complainant\u2019s SOP:\na. all allegations pertaining to the under representation of women in the Executive Group and the under representation of women in other Occupational Groups at the CRA, in particular paragraphs 46-54 and 59-64;\nb. all allegations of discrimination based on the prohibited ground of age;\nc. paragraph 27, Item #10 which asks the Tribunal to award a remedy contrary to section 54.1(2) of the Act; and\nd. all claims for relief post-dating the time period of this complaint.\n2. An order pursuant to section 52(1)(c) of the Act that all personal information of current and former employees of the Respondent unrelated to the complaint be kept confidential.\n[8] The Motion was heard in Toronto on February 4 and 5, 2013. Since the ruling on the Motion may have an effect on the scope of the rest of the hearing into the complaint, it was agreed that it was in the best interest of the parties to adjourn any further hearing time until the Tribunal rendered its present ruling.\n[9] Upon request of the Respondent, the Tribunal held a case management conference call on March 4, 2013 to discuss further issues regarding the Motion. Where relevant to the present ruling, that call is discussed herein.\nII. Issues [10] The Respondent\u2019s Motion raises many issues:\na. On what basis can the Tribunal dismiss part of a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits?\nb. Should all allegations pertaining to the \u201cunder representation\u201d of women in the Executive Group and in other Occupational Groups at the CRA be struck?\nc. Should all allegations of discrimination based on the prohibited ground of age be struck?\nd. Should the remedy at paragraph 27, item #10, of the Complainant\u2019s SOP be struck?\ne. Should all claims for relief post-dating the time period of this complaint be struck?\nf. Should the Tribunal grant an order pursuant to paragraph 52(1)(c) of the Act?\n[11] The positions adopted by the parties on each one of the issues above, and the Tribunal\u2019s analysis thereof, will be discussed in turn.\nIII. Analysis A. On what basis can the Tribunal dismiss part of a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits? [12] According to the Respondent, the Tribunal can dismiss part of a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits. To support its position, the Respondent relies on the recent decision of the Federal Court in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 [FNCFCS et al.]; and, the recent decision of the Tribunal in Murray v. Immigration and Refugee Board, 2013 CHRT 2 [Murray].\n[13] The Commission submits the Tribunal is master of its own procedure and can appropriately decide in any given case the suitable approach to efficiently and expeditiously adjudicate human rights complaints. While the Commission and the Complainant recognize that it is possible for the Tribunal to dismiss all or part of a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits, they emphasize that this jurisdiction should be exercised cautiously and then only where the parties have been given a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make arguments on the matters raised in the complaint.\n[14] I agree that the Tribunal can dismiss all or part of a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits. However, it is important to remember that in the decisions rendered in FNCFCS et al. and Murray, the Federal Court and the Tribunal clearly expressed the view that in dismissing allegations the process must be fair, respecting the rules of natural justice, and the parties must be given a full and ample opportunity to adduce the evidence necessary to decide the issues raised by the motion. The following are some pertinent abstracts of the decision of the Federal Court in FNCFCS et al.:\n[125] That said, after providing due notice, subsection 50(1) of the Act requires the Tribunal member assigned to the case to \u201cgive all parties to whom notice has been given a full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations\u201d.\n\u2026\n[131] Nothing in either the Act or the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure limits the type of motions that can be brought before the Tribunal. Consequently, I see no statutory or regulatory impediment that would preclude the bringing of a motion to have the Tribunal determine a substantive issue in advance of a full hearing of the complaint on its merits.\n[132] Nor is there anything in the Act or the Tribunal\u2019s Rules that would preclude the Tribunal from deciding such a motion, as long as it provides the parties with a \u201cfull and ample opportunity\u201d to adduce the evidence necessary to decide the issue and to make submissions. The process followed by the Tribunal in relation to the hearing of the motion must also be fair, and the rules of natural justice must be respected.\n\u2026\n[140] I do, however, understand the Government to agree with the statement in Buffet that the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits should be exercised cautiously, and then only in the clearest of cases: above at para. 39. I also agree with this statement.\n(FNCFCS et al. at paras. 125, 131-132, 140)\n[15] It is in light of the above principles that I will analyze whether certain portions of the Complainant\u2019s SOP should be struck.\nB. Should all allegations pertaining to the \u201cunder representation\u201d of women in the Executive Group and in other Occupational Groups at the CRA be struck? [16] In its reply to the submissions of the Complainant and the Commission, the Respondent modified its position with regard to issue B as follows:\nThe Respondent no longer objects to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to inquire into the allegation of systemic gender-base discrimination in regards to the Executive Cadre. However, the Respondent seeks direction from the Tribunal and asks the Complainant to identify with specificity which practices and\/or policies she is challenging as discriminatory.\nThe Respondent continues to object to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to inquire into the allegation of systemic gender-base discrimination with respect to other occupational groups identified in the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars. The allegations in respect of these other groups were never investigated by the Commission are solely based on statistical evidence, and do not identify a specific policy or practice.\n(Reply Submissions of the Respondent, Canada Revenue Agency (Motion to Strike Portions of Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars), February 1, 2013, at paras. 2-3)\n[17] There are three aspects to the Respondent\u2019s argument on this issue: (i) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear complaints based solely on statistical evidence; (ii) the Complainant has inappropriately amended her complaint to add new allegations of systemic gender based discrimination to other occupational groups; and, (iii) the Complainant has not identified a specific policy or practice held by the Respondent that she alleges to be discriminatory. Each argument will be examined in turn.\n(i) Does the Tribunal lack jurisdiction to hear complaints based solely on statistical evidence? [18] Subsection 40.1(2) of the Act provides:\n(2) No complaint may be dealt with by the Commission pursuant to section 40 where\n(a) the complaint is made against an employer alleging that the employer has engaged in a discriminatory practice set out in section 7 or paragraph 10(a); and\n(b) the complaint is based solely on statistical information that purports to show that members of one or more designated groups are underrepresented in the employer\u2019s workforce.\n[19] The Respondent submits the Complainant\u2019s allegations with respect to the other Occupational Groups are based solely on statistical evidence of under-representation, which is contrary to subsection 40.1(2). The Respondent is of the view that when the Employment Equity Act, S.C. 1995, c. 44 [the EEA], was enacted, amendments were also made to the Act to harmonize the two laws and avoid duplication. Specifically, subsection 40.1(2) was added to the Act. According to the Respondent, in situations where a complaint is based solely on statistical evidence of under-representation the case should be treated under the EEA and not pursuant to the Act. In support of its position, the Respondent referred to the minutes of proceedings and evidence of the Standing Committee that studied the amendments to the EEA and the Act.\n[20] The Respondent maintains that the Tribunal, even though not mentioned in subsection 40.1(2), has the same obligation as the Commission with regard to the application of this section. According to the Respondent, it does not make sense that the Commission be under an obligation to refuse to examine complaints based solely on statistical information, while the Tribunal would not be subject to the same obligation.\n[21] The Commission\u2019s position is that the wording of subsection 40.1(2) is clear and it applies strictly to the Commission. The Tribunal is not mentioned in subsection 40.1(2). According to the Commission, the Tribunal is a separate and independent institution from the Commission. There is no need to go to the minutes of proceedings of the Standing Committee that studied the amendments to the EEA and the Act to understand subsection 40.1(2). The Commission submits that this subsection is part of sections 40-46 of the Act, which explains the role of the Commission as to the reception and processing of complaints under the Act.\n[22] The Complainant is in agreement with the position adopted by the Commission regarding the inapplicability of subsection 40.1(2) to the present case. However, she denies that her allegations are based solely on statistical information. In support of her position, she referred to paragraph 62 of her SOP:\nAn example of a systemic barrier was the practice of having no fixed procedures or formal selection processes for appointments made to acting Director assignments. The almost exclusive appointment of male colleagues to these career enhancing acting opportunities, was done so in a subjective and non-transparent manner instead of using competition processes that assessed the qualifications and competencies of all interested parties. [\u2026] Even where formal competitions were run for executive promotions, the CRA\u2019s selection processes contained subjective methods of assessment played out during \u00bd hour interviews with \u201cholistic\u201d assessment ratings versus the use of more rigorous, unbiased and objective assessment techniques. Informal and highly discretionary staffing practices are problematic as there is significant room for subjective considerations, differing standards and biases to come into play. I submit these systemic discriminatory practices had an adverse differential impact on women\u2019s career advancement in the OR [Ontario Region] as well as on my individual advancement to the Director positions I aspired to.\n(Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, April 30, 2012, at para. 62)\n[23] I agree that subsection 40.1(2) of the Act prevents the Commission from dealing with a complaint that would be \u201c\u2026based solely on statistical information that purports to show that members of one or more designated groups are underrepresented in the employer\u2019s workforce\u201d (see subsection 40.1(2) of the Act). However, the Tribunal is not mentioned in subsection 40.1(2). In fact, sections 40-46 relate exclusively to the role of the Commission in processing complaints; and, subsection 40.1(2) is one of those sections.\n[24] The role of the Commission and the Tribunal are clearly defined in the Act. With regard to complaints, the Tribunal\u2019s role is to institute inquiries into them when the Commission deems such an inquiry to be warranted (see sections 49-50 of the Act). While I assume the Commission has examined the complaint against the requirements of subsection 40.1(2) of the Act; in any event, it is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to sit in appeal of the Commission\u2019s decision or to review it. That is the role of the Federal Court on judicial review (see Murray at para. 37; Deborah P. Labelle v. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 CHRT 4 at para. 71; International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), Local 400 v. Oster, [2002] 2 FC 430 at paras. 29-30; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Warman, 2012 FC 1162 at paras. 55-57; and, Halifax (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), 2012 SCC 10 at paras. 23, 27, and 33).\n[25] Given that subsection 40.1(2) of the Act relates exclusively to the Commission, I am of the view that it does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s ability to inquire into the Complainant\u2019s allegations. That said, the focus of complaints under sections 7 and 10 of the Act are on the discriminatory practices set out therein, and not under-representation per se. Therefore, the question as to whether the Complainant\u2019s allegations are based solely on statistical information of under-representation will be examined following the hearing of all the Complainant\u2019s evidence. At this stage, prior to having received any evidence on the merits of the Complainant\u2019s allegations, I cannot determine whether her allegations are based solely on statistical information of under-representation. The Tribunal recently adopted a similar approach in Murray:\n[48] Nor do I accept that paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act now limits the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider the current complaint. As stated above, section 40.1 of the Act applies strictly to the Commission and, once an inquiry is requested, it is the Tribunal\u2019s role to inquire into the complaint. In my view, once a complaint is referred to the Tribunal, the question as to whether or not the complaint is based solely on statistical evidence is a matter to be considered in determining whether the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination. At this point in the proceedings, prior to having received any evidence on the merits of the complaint, there is no basis upon which the Tribunal can determine if the complaint is based solely on statistical evidence and, consequently, whether the Complainant has established a prima facie case.\n[49] Therefore, paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act does not limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider this complaint.\n(Murray at paras. 48-49)\n[26] Similarly, I conclude that subsection 40.1(2) of the Act does not prevent the Tribunal from inquiring into the Complainant\u2019s allegations.\n(ii) Has the Complainant inappropriately amended her complaint to add new allegations of systemic gender based discrimination to other occupational groups? [27] According to the Respondent, allegations regarding the under-representation of woman in other occupational groups, aside from the executive group, only first appeared in the Complainant\u2019s SOP. The Respondent did not have the benefit of having this allegation investigated by the Commission or providing a response thereto to the Commission\u2019s investigator. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the allegation regarding the under-representation of women in other occupational groups is an entirely new complaint within itself and the Respondent would be prejudiced by its inclusion within the current inquiry. The Respondent adds, there is no link between this new allegation and the initial complaint.\n[28] For her part, the Complainant maintains that she has not amended her complaint and that the Respondent has been aware of the systemic nature of her complaint in regard to women in other occupational groups since its initial filing and through the Commission\u2019s investigation process. During the hearing of this motion, the Complainant indicated that examining the under-representation of women in both the executive and other occupational groups would support her systemic allegation that ingrained attitudes unfavourable to women\u2019s advancement manifested in behaviours that resulted in discriminatory staffing decisions made during informal and subjective staffing processes. In this regard, the Complainant claims that statistics of under-representation can be used as circumstantial evidence from which discrimination may be inferred.\n[29] I do not accept that the Complainant has amended her complaint to add new allegations of systemic gender based discrimination. The allegations forming the basis of a complaint must be differentiated from the evidence advanced to support it. In her SOP, at paragraph 63, the Complainant distinguishes between the two:\nIt is also my position that I was subject to engrained attitudinal and cultural barriers that negatively stereotyped women from the audit field (my background) as not being strong and as capable as men in leadership roles. The evidence clearly shows women AUs (auditors) have historically been under-represented in the CRA. They have also suffered historic exclusion at the higher levels of the organization, especially at the executive levels where they were almost non-existent over the period of my complaint. It is my position that systemic discriminatory practices blocked women in the audit field from advancing to key executive positions in the CRA\u2019s organization. I submit they were also a factor impeding my advancement to a Director\u2019s position in the OR.\n(Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, April 30, 2012, at para. 63)\n[30] As this statement indicates, the under-representation of women in the CRA is not the basis of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of systemic discrimination. Rather, it is the \u201c\u2026engrained attitudinal and cultural barriers that negatively stereotyped women from the audit field [\u2026] from advancing to key executive positions in the CRA\u2019s organization\u201d that forms the basis of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of systemic discrimination. The Complainant points to statistical information of women auditors being historically under-represented in the CRA, whether in the executive group or other occupational groups, as evidence in support of her allegations of systemic discrimination. Whether that evidence supports the Complainant\u2019s allegations or establishes a prima facie case of discrimination will be determined following the hearing of this complaint.\n[31] The Respondent has been given an opportunity to respond to the Complainant\u2019s arguments by submitting its own SOP. The Respondent will also be given a full and ample opportunity to present its own evidence and arguments in response to the Complainant at the hearing of this complaint. I see no prejudice to the Respondent if the Complainant advances statistical information regarding the under-representation of women in other occupational groups at the CRA to support her allegations of systemic discrimination.\n(iii) Has the Complainant identified a policy or practice held by the Respondent that she alleges to be discriminatory? [32] According to the Respondent, the Complainant has failed to identify a specific policy or practice held by the Respondent that she alleges to be discriminatory. Instead, relying solely on statistical information, her systemic complaints are couched in vague and imprecise allegations of \u201corganizational culture\u201d, \u201cattitudinal barriers\u201d and \u201cold boys club\u201d. The Respondent submits the complaint is not with respect to any identifiable informal staffing practices, but with the exercise of management\u2019s discretion as allegedly influenced by attitudinal and cultural barriers perceived by the Complainant.\n[33] In her reply to the Respondent\u2019s SOP, the Complainant provided as follows:\n12. [...] I will also provide evidence to demonstrate the practice of awarding acting opportunities over the period of my complaint created systemic barriers to women\u2019s advancement in the executive group in the Ontario Region. The informal and subjective nature of these practices allowed for bias and prejudice to guide the CRA\u2019s decisions whether intentionally or unintentionally, adversely impacting the careers of women executives including mine. For example, all acting assignments were unadvertised; call letters were never circulated soliciting applications from interested parties, a practice that created barriers and denied fair access to qualified executives; all acting appointments were made informally and without competition; executives appointed were handpicked based on the personal views of the Assistant Commissioner and an all male succession planning committee; qualifications for the acting positions were not determined in advance and competencies were not assessed to ensure the candidate chosen was qualified and was the right executive for the job which the CRA points out in paragraph 56 to be its goal; the only documented rationale for the CRA\u2019s selection decision was contained in a brief staffing announcement citing generic reasons such as management continuity; many of the chosen candidates were allowed to remain in their acting assignments for lengthy periods of time, i.e., six months to over fifteen months without competition or assessment of their qualifications; and in cases where the acting executive aspired to the position, they would subsequently be appointed on a permanent basis to it from a tainted competition process.\n[\u2026]\n19. In paragraph 55, the CRA takes the position I was not treated unfairly or in an arbitrary manner in the 2006 selection processes since Mr. Baker determined this to be the case, as a result of a staffing appeal I filed termed a \u201cDecision Review\u201d. I disagree with CRA\u2019s position. It is my position Mr. Baker\u2019s decision was seriously flawed, biased and he simply rubber stamped the selection board\u2019s results. For example, I was denied access to my source assessment documents which prejudiced my ability to mount an appeal based on the relevant facts. I was never given any reasons for my appeal being dismissed. The selection process\u2019s anomalies raised in my appeal were never addressed with me nor was I given the opportunity to provide rebuttal submissions to the CRA\u2019s response to my appeal document. The CRA categorically denied me any form of natural justice in the recourse I undertook. Added to this, Mr. Baker, the Decision Reviewer of my appeal, was the person who approved the appointment of the successful candidates in the selection processes I appealed which raises a serious conflict of interest issue. And, Mr. Baker was also Mr. Hillier\u2019s boss, the chairperson of the selection processes. CRA\u2019s executive recourse is unique in the federal service in that unsuccessful candidates seeking recourse in a competition process are denied the right to an independent third party appeal board hearing. What you have in the CRA is an unfair, in-house paper review process by senior executives investigating senior executives which I submit allows for significant bias to enter into the decision.\n(Complainant\u2019s Reply to Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars, June 19, 2012, at paras. 12, 19)\n[34] On this basis, I am satisfied that the Complainant has satisfactorily identified the practices she is alleging to cause discrimination contrary to section 10 of the Act. The Complainant\u2019s submissions are sufficient to put the Respondent on notice of the case to be met in these proceedings; and, as mentioned above, the Respondent has and will continue to be given a full and ample opportunity to meet that case.\n[35] Therefore, for the reasons above, I reject the Respondent\u2019s arguments that: (i) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear complaints based solely on statistical evidence; (ii) the Complainant has inappropriately amended her complaint to add new allegations of systemic gender based discrimination to other occupational groups; and, (iii) the Complainant has not identified a specific policy or practice held by the Respondent that she alleges to be discriminatory. As a result, I dismiss the Respondent\u2019s request to strike all allegations pertaining to the \u201cunder representation\u201d of women in other occupational groups at the CRA from the Complainant\u2019s SOP.\nC. Should all allegations of discrimination based on the prohibited ground of age be struck? [36] In its decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal, the Respondent claims the Commission made a clear reference to the Complainant\u2019s allegations of gender discrimination, but made no reference to allegations of individual or systemic age discrimination. According to the Respondent, the Commission\u2019s silence on this issue should be interpreted to mean that the Commission did not refer allegations of age discrimination to the Tribunal. While the Respondent recognizes that a mention of individual and systemic age discrimination is made in the Complaint Form, the Commission\u2019s Investigator recommended the dismissal of both allegations. The Respondent assumed the Commission would have adopted the Investigator\u2019s recommendations and, consequently, would have decided not to refer those allegations to the Tribunal.\n[37] The Commission disagrees with the position advanced by the Respondent. The Commission claims allegations of discrimination based on age are outlined in the Complaint Form and that the whole complaint, without exclusion, was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. Specifically, the Commission refers to the August 25, 2011 letter sent by the Deputy Chief Commissioner of the Commission to the Chairperson of the Tribunal requesting: \u201c\u2026that you institute an inquiry into the complaint as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted [\u2026] A copy of the complaint form is included\u201d.\n[38] According to the Commission, the expression \u201chaving regard to all the circumstances\u201d meant that its decision had been taken after having studied all the information and documents available on the file, including the Complaint Form, the Investigator\u2019s Report and the exchange of written communications between the parties. Furthermore, the fact that the Complaint Form was included indicates that it did not refer a part of the complaint, but rather it referred the whole complaint. On this basis, the Commission submits that there is no reason to assume that it referred only part of the complaint to the Tribunal.\n[39] The Complainant\u2019s position on issue C is as follows:\n16. [\u2026] The Commission referred my complaint of individual and systemic discrimination based on sex and age pursuant to ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA. The Commission\u2019s decision did not state anywhere that its referral excluded age discrimination. The Tribunal is thereby seized with my entire complaint which includes age discrimination [...] Furthermore, the Commission states in its\nAugust 10, 2011 decision that it considered my Complaint, the Investigation report and the parties submissions, and having regard for all of the circumstances, referred my complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry. The documents considered by the Commission show the grounds for my complaint are on sex and age made pursuant to ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA. My arguments supporting age discrimination were laid out in the Investigation Report which the Commission examined and considered in making its decision. The evidence clearly shows the Commission referred my allegations of age discrimination to the Tribunal, giving the Tribunal the jurisdiction to hear them.\n(Response Submissions of Complainant to Respondent\u2019s Motion Dated December 21, 2012, January 25, 2013, at para. 16)\n[40] It appears to me that, based on the Complaint Form transmitted to the Tribunal, the Complainant had clearly indicated that she was complaining about individual and systemic discrimination on the basis of gender and age. Had the Commission decided to dismiss her allegations on the basis of age, it would have made a specific decision about it, would have provided reasons for the dismissal and, thereafter, would have indicated the dismissal of this portion of the complaint in its referral letter to the Tribunal. This is not the case in the present circumstances.\n[41] A similar question was raised in C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2003 CHRT 32 [C\u00f4t\u00e9]. I find the comments of former Member Hadjis to be instructive in this case:\nIn my opinion, it is evident from the Chief Commissioner's letter to the Tribunal Chairperson that all the aspects of the complaint, as set out in the complaint form that was signed by the Complainant in 1996, were referred to the Tribunal by the Commission. I do not find anything in the Chief Commissioner's letter from which to infer that less than the entire complaint was being sent on for inquiry by the Tribunal. Furthermore, one must not lose sight of the fact that although the Commission has the authority to decide whether a complaint is to be referred to the Tribunal (ss. 44(3) and 49 of the Act), the complaint continues to remain the complainant's, not the Commission's. The Complainant in the present case has never amended her complaint.\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9 at para. 12)\n[42] In contrast to the decision in C\u00f4t\u00e9, I also find the decision of Member Hadjis in Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22 [Kowalski], to be instructive. In Kowalski, four allegations of discrimination had been made by the complainant. The Commission dismissed two of them. It informed the parties of its decision. However, the Commission referred the complaint to the Tribunal without mentioning its previous decision. The question raised then in front of the Tribunal was: did the Commission refer some or all of the allegations to the Tribunal. Member Hadjis found:\nIn the present case, the Commission specifically decided not to deal with two of the four allegations in the complaint, and provided the parties with written decisions to that effect, which were both in fact entitled \"Decision of the Commission\". As such, it is clear that the Commission exercised its discretion, pursuant to s. 41, not to deal with these allegations. In light of the Commission's explicit determinations in this regard, I am satisfied that the Commission did not ultimately refer these portions of the complaint to the Tribunal.\n(Kowalski at para. 10)\n[43] I consider it important to mention that the present Motion was brought by the Respondent. Consequently, it is up to the Respondent to convince the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to dismiss aspects of the complaint, a discretion the Tribunal exercises cautiously and only in the clearest of cases (FNCFCS et al. at para. 140). Given this caveat, and the clear wording of the Complaint Form and referral letter to the Tribunal, I am not convinced that the Commission referred anything less than the whole complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry. For these reasons, I dismiss the Respondent\u2019s request to strike all allegations of discrimination based on the prohibited ground of age from the Complainant\u2019s SOP.\nD. Should the remedy at paragraph 27, item #10, of the Complainant\u2019s SOP be struck? [44] The remedy in question is as follows:\n10. Evidence of an aggressive staffing strategy to close and keep closed, existing gaps in all of the Employment Equity Occupational Groups in the CRA.\n(Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, April 30, 2012)\n[45] According to the Respondent, the remedy requested by the Complainant is contrary to subsection 54.1(2) of the Act. Section 54.1 provides:\n54.1 (1) In this section,\n\u201cdesignated groups\u201d has the meaning assigned in section 3 of the Employment Equity Act; and\n\u201cemployer\u201d means a person who or organization that discharges the obligations of an employer under the Employment Equity Act.\n(2) Where a Tribunal finds that a complaint against an employer is substantiated, it may not make an order pursuant to subparagraph 53(2)(a)(i) requiring the employer to adopt a special program, plan or arrangement containing\n(a) positive policies and practices designed to ensure that members of designated groups achieve increased representation in the employer\u2019s workforce; or\n(b) goals and timetables for achieving that increased representation.\n(3) For greater certainty, subsection (2) shall not be construed as limiting the power of a Tribunal, under paragraph 53(2)(a), to make an order requiring an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice.\n[46] The Respondent\u2019s position on issue D is as follows:\n63. Where the Tribunal finds that a complaint is substantiated, it may grant the Complainant appropriate relief as set out at s.53 of the CHRA. Under this provision, the Tribunal may, pursuant to s. 53(2)(a)(i), order that a person adopt a special program, plan or arrangement designed to reduce and\/or eliminate disadvantages based on or related to a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n64. However, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to grant relief under s. 53(2)(a) of the CHRA is qualified by s.54.1. Under that provision, the Tribunal \u201cmay not make an order pursuant to subparagraph 53(2)(a)(i)\u201d requiring an employer that is subject to the provisions of the EEA to notably adopt positive policies and practices designed to increase representation of designated groups. Subsection 54.1(3) clarifies that the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to order remedies requiring an employer to cease or correct a discriminatory practice. However no specific practice was alleged by the Complainant to be discriminatory.\n65. In this matter, the Complainant seeks relief under s. 53(2)(a)(i), namely \u201cevidence of an aggressive staffing strategy to close and keep closed existing gaps in all of the Employment Equity Occupational Groups in [the Respondent].\u201d An aggressive staffing strategy designed to reduce and\/or eliminate alleged disadvantages to women is precisely the kind of positive policy or practice envisioned by s. 53(2)(a)(i) and barred by s.54.1 as against an employer subject to the EEA. As the Respondent is an employer pursuant to s.4(c) of the EEA, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to award the remedy sought by the Complainant is barred by s. 54.1 of the CHRA. For this reason, this portion of the Complainant\u2019s claim for relief should be struck.\n(Written Representations of the Respondent (Motion to strike portions of Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars), December 21, 2012, at paras 63-65)\n[47] According to the Commission, a plain reading of section 54.1 demonstrates that the Tribunal has the necessary remedial power to correct and prevent discriminatory practices. Subsection 54.1(2) does not limit the Tribunal\u2019s authority to order an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice. In fact, the Commission submits the Act expressly authorizes the Tribunal to use its remedial powers to address systemic discrimination such as that alleged by the Complainant.\n[48] In response to the Respondent\u2019s arguments on issue D, the Complainant decided to amend her remedy to read as follows: \u201cThe CRA cease or correct deficiencies in its informal and subjective staffing practices that I identified as discriminatory in my complaint\u201d (Response Submissions of Complainant to Respondent\u2019s Motion Dated December 21, 2012,\nJanuary 25, 2013, at para. 17). According to the Complainant, under subsection 54.1(3) of the Act, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to order the amended remedy.\n[49] During the second day of hearing on this Motion, although the Commission was not present, the Complainant and the Respondent arrived at an agreement regarding the proposed amendment to the Complainant\u2019s remedy. The following is a transcript of the exchange that took place during the hearing:\nAt 2:46:50 on recorded transcript on February 5, 2013\nGillian Patterson (GP): So what are requesting, it seems as all parties are in agreement, we are requesting formally, that if you can order this in your decision that Ms Emmett, by consent of all parties, I guess, amend her Statement of Particulars, to award ... to a remedy that is consistent with the statute.\nMember B\u00e9langer (MB): No, I think you should be more specific. We should say that that we should say we replace with what she said in the first paragraph, by what is said in here.\nGP: That\u2019s fine.\nMB: O.K., so, I\u2019m just wondering how to do it. I guess I could...\nDiane Emmett (DE): Can I not just send in an email to all the parties saying I hereby I further amend, or whatever, is that...?\nMB: ... Yes I guess, as long as the content is the same as what is written here.\nGP: Well the only issue is that, if we\u2019re waiting for a decision from you ... Oh, I guess we could proceed that way.\nMB: In fact as long as we agree here today and it is just that we are put in writing and she would sign it, no not sign it, and you send it by email to each the parties ... let me write this down.\nDE: So, it\u2019s not fancy, it would just be one page. I don\u2019t want to send the whole document.\nMB: Oh no, it\u2019s very short...\n(Partial Transcript of Hearing Held on February 5, 2013, being Exhibit \u201cB\u201d of the Affidavit of Lisa Minarovich, March 4, 2013)\n[50] What came out of this exchange, even though the words used could have been clearer and used in a more elegant fashion, is that the Complainant and the Respondent were of the opinion that an agreement had been reached as to the content of the amendment sought by the Complainant. The Complainant was to put the amendment in writing and send it to the Tribunal and the Respondent by email in the days following the hearing.\n[51] On February 11, 2013, by email, the Complainant, as requested, submitted her amended remedy:\nThe CRA cease or otherwise correct its staffing practices that I have identified as discriminatory.\n[52] In an email response dated February 12, 2013, the Respondent provided:\nHowever, in her motion response material at paragraph 17, Ms Emmett agreed to amend her SOP to \u201cThe CRA cease or correct deficiencies in its informal and subjective staffing practices that I identified as discriminatory in my complaint\u201d.\nIn view of the above, the Respondent objects to the amendment proposed in Ms. Emmett\u2019s email of yesterday. We ask that she amend her Statement of Particulars to be consistent with what the parties consented to at the hearing, and what is indicated in her written submissions to the Tribunal.\n[53] In an email reply dated February 14, 2013, the Complainant submitted:\nI respectfully submit that Ms. Patterson\u2019s objection to my amended remedy, i.e., \u201cThe CRA cease or otherwise correct its staffing practices that I have identified as discriminatory\u201d, is overly technical and inappropriate.\nI agreed to amend my remedy so it falls in line with subsection 54.1(3) of the Canadian Human Right Act which allows the Tribunal the discretionary authority to order the CRA to cease or correct a discriminatory practice under paragraph 53(2)(a).\nMy amended remedy is clearly in accordance with subsection 54.1(3) and is thereby appropriate.\n[54] In the same email of February 14, 2013, the Complainant also submitted the following two additional amendments:\nI also amend the remedy located at point 2 on page 26 of my April 30, 2012 SOP to include lost wages as a result of EX3 Acting opportunities that I was denied because of the CRA\u2019S alleged discriminatory conduct.\nFurther to the above, I reserve the right to amend my remedies at a future date based on the evidence presented at the Tribunal hearing.\n[55] Following reception of the Complainant\u2019s email of February 14, 2013, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to schedule a case management conference call to straighten out the situation before the ruling on the present Motion. Consequently, a case management conference call took place on March 4, 2013.\n[56] Prior to the conference call, in correspondence dated March 4, 2013, the Respondent set out its position on the amendments proposed by the Complainant:\nMoreover, since the hearing on the motion, the Complainant has sought two additional amendments to her complaint. These new amendments were not the subject matter of the motion, nor were they addressed formally in writing. On February 14, 2013, the Complainant sought to further amend paragraph 27 of her statement of particulars to add a claim for lost wages. In addition, the Complainant states: \u201cI reserve the right to amend my remedies at a future date based on the evidence presented at the Tribunal hearing.\u201d\nThe respondent\u2019s consent to the complainant\u2019s amendment was contingent upon her representations, both written and oral. However, the complainant now seeks to amend her statement of particulars in a manner inconsistent with her representations to the Tribunal. Moreover, the amendments sought by the Complainant are vague and lack specificity, resulting in substantial prejudice to the Respondent. In these circumstances, and given the complainant\u2019s indication that she may seek future amendments based on the evidence presented, the respondent\u2019s position is that any amendments to the complainant\u2019s statement of particulars must be done by way of formal motion in accordance with Rule 3 of this Tribunal\u2019s rules of procedure.\n[57] During the case management conference call of March 4, 2013, the Complainant and the Respondent reiterated their respective positions. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Complainant had accepted to amend her remedy to make it consistent with the Act. According to the Complainant, her amended remedy follows the wording of the Act and, therefore, is in conformity with what the parties agreed during the hearing. She added that the remedy is a matter that should be considered following the evidence presented at the hearing.\n[58] The Commission also participated in the March 4, 2013 conference call. It submitted that remedies must be examined holistically and do not have to be specific. According to the Commission, the Complainant can amend her remedies as long as the Respondent is not taken by surprise.\n[59] The Respondent\u2019s request under issue D began with an opposition based on subsection 54.1(2) of the Act. The issue now includes a concern regarding amending the Complainant\u2019s SOP. I will address each in turn.\n[60] With respect to subsection 54.1(2) of the Act, the wording of legislation is clear. Positive policies or practices designed to ensure that members of designated groups achieve increased representation in the workforce, including goals and timetables for achieving that increased representation, are to be covered by the EEA. In Murray, the Tribunal came to a similar conclusion:\nAs opposed to section 40.1, which applies solely to the Commission, section 54.1 of the Act does apply to the Tribunal. Again, the Tribunal does not dispute that the addition of this section was intended to avoid duplication between the enforcement mechanisms of the EEA and the Act. This is clear when one considers section 10 of the EEA, which requires employers to address the issues found in paragraphs 54.1(2)(a) and 54.1(2)(b) of the Act under their respective employment equity plans. As mentioned above, Parliament has chosen a cooperative and collaborative approach to enforcing the issues in paragraphs 54.1(2)(a) and 54.1(2)(b) of the Act \u201c\u2026through persuasion and the negotiation of written undertakings\u2026\u201d between the Commission and employers under the EEA (see subsections 22(1) and 22(2) of the EEA). Therefore, I agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal cannot make an order requiring a respondent to implement positive policies and practices designed to ensure that members of designated groups achieve increased representation in the employer\u2019s workforce. Nor can the Tribunal make an order that sets goals and timetables for achieving that increased representation.\n(Murray at para. 54)\n[61] However, the wording of subsection 54.1(3) of the Act is also clear. Despite the limitations in subsection 54.1(2), the Tribunal can still \u201c\u2026make an order requiring an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice\u201d (see subsection 54.1(3) of the Act). Again, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in Murray is instructive:\nThat said, I do not agree that the limitations in subsection 54.1(2) of the Act limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to order an effective remedy in this case. Subsection 54.1(3) specifically states subsection 54.1(2) does not limit the power of the Tribunal to make an order requiring an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice under paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Act. Specifically, I note, despite the limitations in 54.1(2) of the Act, paragraph 53(2)(a)(i) still allows the Tribunal to order an employer to adopt a special program, plan or arrangement designed to prevent, eliminate, or reduce disadvantages suffered by any group of individuals. Furthermore, subsection 54.1(2) of the Act does not otherwise limit the Tribunal\u2019s power to order any of the other remedies found at paragraphs 53(2)(b) to 53(2)(e) or subsections 53(3) and 53(4) of the Act.\n(Murray at para. 55)\n[62] Furthermore, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial authority under the Act is derived from subsection 53(2), which provides: \u201cIf at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order\u2026\u201d; in French: \u201c\u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner\u2026\u201d (emphasis added). The wording of subsection 53(2) of the Act is also consistent with the operating words of subsection 54.1(3): \u201cWhere a Tribunal finds that a complaint against an employer is substantiated\u2026\u201d; in French: \u201cLe tribunal qui juge fond\u00e9e une plainte contre un employeur\u2026\u201d (emphasis added). In my view, the emphasized words suggest the Tribunal\u2019s remedial authority is only invoked at the conclusion of an inquiry, once a complaint has been substantiated. Therefore, I will consider whether the Complainant\u2019s requested remedy is contrary to subsection 54.1(2) of the Act at the conclusion of the inquiry, in consideration of all the arguments and evidence presented by the parties during the hearing, and only if the complaint is substantiated.\n[63] Therefore, as framed pursuant subsection 54.1(2) of the Act, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s request to strike the remedy at paragraph 27, item #10, of the Complainant\u2019s SOP.\n[64] With respect to the proposed amendments to the Complainant\u2019s remedies, given the dispute between the parties and the Respondent\u2019s concerns regarding prejudice, I think the fairest way to proceed would be to have the Complainant bring a Notice of Motion pursuant to Rule 3 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) to amend her complaint. In her motion, the Complainant can layout the basis for her proposed amendments and the Respondent will then have an opportunity to respond and explain the grounds for its concerns to the proposed amendments. Based on fulsome submissions from the parties, the Tribunal will then have an informed basis upon which to rule on whether to allow the amendments.\nE. Should all claims for relief post-dating the time period of this complaint be struck? [65] To establish the time period covered by the complaint, the Respondent says that it is necessary to take into account all three complaints filed by the Complainant, including the two retaliation complaints that were dismissed by the Commission and have not been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. According to the Respondent, the Complainant is not permitted to seek relief for time periods falling outside the period covered by her initial complaint\n(February 22, 1999 to September 6, 2006) and that fall within those periods covered by the retaliation complaints (September 10, 2007 and ongoing). Specifically, the Respondent submits:\nIn requesting these terms of relief, the Complainant improperly seeks to incorporate into this matter relief sought in other complaints that have not been referred to the Tribunal for further inquiry. This is an unacceptable skirting of the Commissions\u2019 role as gatekeeper and should not be permitted. Further, the pursuit of relief for time periods that have already been considered and dismissed by the Commission is duplicative and an abuse of process. For these reasons, the items of relief post-dating the scope of this complaint should be struck.\n(Written Representation of the Respondent (Motion to strike portions of Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, December 21, 2012, at para. 68)\n[66] In the Complainant\u2019s view, she should not be restricted to the time period covered by the allegations in her complaint. She described the allegations in her complaint as a \u201cgoing concern\u201d and, therefore, the remedies she requests cannot be restricted to the particular time period of the events that gave rise to the complaint.\n[67] The Commission adopted a position similar to the Complainant\u2019s and also disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s position.\n[68] As mentioned above, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial authority is only invoked at the conclusion of an inquiry, once a complaint has been substantiated (see subsection 53(2) of the Act). Furthermore, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37). In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50).\n[69] At this stage of the proceedings, prior to having received any evidence on the merits of the Complainant\u2019s allegations, I see no basis upon which I can dismiss the Complainant\u2019s claims for relief post-dating the time period of her complaint. I was also not provided with any authority, whether in the Act or otherwise, that restricts the period over which complainants can claim relief. The fact that the Complainant\u2019s retaliation complaints were dismissed by the Commission is also not persuasive. Ultimately, the Complainant still has to establish a link between the alleged discriminatory practices and the loss she is claiming. If there is no link, and the remedies requested are only related to the retaliation complaints, the remedy will not be awarded. The Respondent will have a full and ample opportunity to present its arguments in this regard at the hearing of this matter.\n[70] Therefore, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent\u2019s request to strike from the Complainant\u2019s SOP all claims for relief post-dating the time period of the complaint.\nF. Should the Tribunal grant an order pursuant to paragraph 52(1)(c) of the Act? [71] The Respondent requests an order pursuant to paragraph 52(1)(c) of the Act to protect the identity of individuals unrelated to this complaint. According to the Respondent, the disclosure of personal information for public view could cause undue hardship for individuals unrelated to this complaint, whose only involvement is that they applied for the same positions as the Complainant.\n[72] During the hearing of this Motion, both the Complainant and the Commission indicated that they did not have an objection to the Respondent\u2019s request.\n[73] In light of the agreement of the parties on this issue, and pursuant to paragraph 52(1)(c) of the Act, I order:\nThe parties and their representatives to keep confidential all information regarding the identity of current and former employees of the Respondent unrelated to the complaint.\n[74] To ensure additional confidentiality, I assured the parties that, even though the names of persons related to the complaint could be mentioned during the hearing, they would not appear in the Tribunal\u2019s decision; in as far as it would be possible.\nIV. Conclusion [75] For the reasons above, the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike portions of the Complainant\u2019s SOP is dismissed.\n[76] The Respondent\u2019s request for an order under to paragraph 52(1)(c) of the Act is granted pursuant to the terms outlined at paragraph 73 above.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nMay 8, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1727\/8211\nStyle of Cause: Diane Carolyn Emmett v.

Does the complaint impugn a discriminatory practice in the provision of services customarily available to the general public that could be the subject of a finding of prima facie discrimination under section 5 of the Act?. 54\nI. Complaints [1] The Complainants, Jeremy and Mardy Matson and Melody Schneider, who are siblings, each filed a complaint pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. The complaints are made against Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, now known as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (the Respondent).\n[2] The Complainants allege discrimination on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, sex and family status based on the manner in which they were registered as Indians under the Indian Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5 [the Indian Act]. The Complainants submit that, due to their matrilineal Indian heritage, they continue to be treated differently in their registration under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act, when compared to those whose lineage is paternal and are registered under subsection 6(1). Namely, registration under subsection 6(2) does not allow the Complainants to pass on their status to their children.\nII. Background [3] The Tribunal had the benefit of an Agreed Statement of Facts in this case. Along with the submissions of the parties, the background of the present complainants can be summarized as follows.\n[4] The Complainants have one Indian grandparent: a woman who lost status when she married a non-Indian before 1985, and who regained her status under paragraph 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act with the passage of An Act to Amend the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 32 (1st Supp.), in 1985. By virtue of those same amendments, the children of her marriage with a non-Indian man (one of whom was the Complainants\u2019 father, Eugene Matson) were deemed eligible for status under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act. Since the 1985 amendments only gave their father status under subsection 6(2), and since their mother was a non-Indian, the Complainants were not, at the time of the filing of these complaints, entitled to any status under the Indian Act. Subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act does not allow a person to pass his or her status to children with non Indians. As a result, the children the Complainants\u2019 have had with non-Indians since 1985 were also not entitled to status.\n[5] In November and December 2008, the Complainants filed the present complaints. Along with their complaints, they prepared and delivered a chart that sets out their family and status history as compared to a hypothetical family history that is identical in all respects, save for the sex of their Indian grandparent. In other words, in the hypothetical family history, their Indian grandparent is male instead of female. All dates of births, marriages and deaths are consistent in both scenarios. As shown in the chart, the Complainants in the hypothetical patrilineal scenario would have status under subsection 6(1) of the Indian Act. As a result, they would be able to pass 6(2) status to their children.\n[6] On April 6, 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rendered its decision in the matter of McIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153 [McIvor], wherein it declared paragraphs 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act to be of no force or effect as these provisions infringed the right to equality under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B of the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 [the Charter]. The Court found the infringement could not be justified under section 1 of the Charter. The declaration was suspended for one year to allow Parliament time to review and consider new amendments to the Indian Act.\n[7] On November 9, 2009, pursuant to section 49 of the Act, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested the Tribunal institute an inquiry into the Complainants\u2019 complaints. Under subsection 40(4) of the Act, the Commission also requested the Tribunal institute a single inquiry into these complaints as it was satisfied that they involve substantially the same issues of fact and law.\n[8] On November 2, 2010, the Tribunal adjourned the proceedings in this matter. The British Columbia Court of Appeal had extended the deadline for Parliament to comply with its decision in McIvor and legislation was pending before Parliament in response thereto (see 2010 CHRT 28).\n[9] On January 31, 2011, the Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act, S.C. 2010, c. 18 [the GEIRA], came into effect. Among other things, the GEIRA amended the registration provisions of the Indian Act by adding a new paragraph 6(1)(c.1), which adds an entitlement to be registered for certain persons whose mothers had lost status by marrying non-Indians before April 17, 1985.\n[10] As a consequence of the passage of the GEIRA, (i) Eugene Matson, the Complainants\u2019 father, was deemed to have been entitled to registration under the new paragraph 6(1)(c.1) of the Indian Act, and (ii) the Complainants became eligible to be registered under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act.\n[11] In May and June 2011, the Complainants were registered as Indians under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act. While they also applied for their children to be registered, the Indian Registrar determined there is no provision in the Indian Act to allow for the registration of a person when one of the parents is registered under subsection 6(2) and the other parent is not an Indian as defined by the Indian Act.\n[12] Following the enactment of the GEIRA and the Complainants\u2019 registrations under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act, on September 27, 2011, the Tribunal ruled that it would be appropriate for amended Statements of Particulars to be submitted. The Tribunal determined that, while the complaints respecting the Complainants\u2019 registration under the Indian Act were now moot since they had now been registered, the part of the complaints relating to the opportunity to pass status on to any children with non-Indians was still live (see 2011 CHRT 14).\n[13] On January 19, 2012, the Complainants filed a Notice of Constitutional Question (NCQ). The Complainants\u2019 NCQ sought to challenge the constitutional validity of section 6 of the Indian Act under the Charter. The basis of the Charter challenge was that section 6 of the Indian Act is in contravention of sections 2 and 3 of the Act and sections 1 and 15(1) of the Charter, and should be struck down and declared to be of no force and effect.\n[14] On July 30, 2012, the Respondent brought a motion for an order striking out the whole of the Complainants\u2019 NCQ.\n[15] On September 6, 2012, the Tribunal allowed the Respondent\u2019s motion and ordered the whole of the Complainants\u2019 NCQ to be struck out. The Tribunal determined that the Complainants\u2019 NCQ attempted to adjudicate the same facts alleged to be in contravention of the Act under the Charter. As section 50(2) of the Act only provides the Tribunal with the power to decide all questions of law \u201cnecessary to determining the matter\u201d, namely whether a discriminatory practice has occurred within the meaning of sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act, the Tribunal found the constitutional question was not linked to determining whether a discriminatory practice has occurred within the meaning of the Act. It was a separate question of law altogether, unrelated to the Act\u2019s statutory mandate in this case (see 2012 CHRT 19).\n[16] Following the above substantive and procedural background, the Tribunal held a hearing in this matter on January 30th and 31st, 2013 in Kelowna, British Columbia.\nIII. Bifurcated Hearing [17] Pursuant to Rule 5(3)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), and upon the consent of the parties, the hearing of this matter is proceeding in two stages. The hearing of the first stage of the complaint on January 30th and 31st, 2013 was to address the following questions:\n(a) Is the complaint a challenge to legislation and nothing else?\n(b) Is the Tribunal bound to follow the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 FCA 7, leave to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed (34706) [Murphy], and dismiss the complaint?\n(c) Does the complaint impugn a discriminatory practice in the provision of services customarily available to the general public that could be the subject of a finding of prima facie discrimination under section 5 of the Act?\n[18] Before proceeding to the second stage of the hearing, I will address the above mentioned questions.\nIV. Positions of the Parties A. The Complainants [19] The Complainants submit that registration as an Indian under the Indian Act is a \u201cservice\u201d under section 5 of the Act. They claim this service includes the determination of who is and who is not entitled to be registered as an Indian.\n[20] According to the Complainants, registration as an Indian does not happen automatically, as you must apply. This includes filling out an application form, proving ancestry information, and submitting supporting documentation. Therefore, the Complainants claim the Respondent creates a service relationship between it and those applying for Indian status under the Indian Act; and, because of that relationship, section 5 of the Act applies to section 6 of the Indian Act.\n[21] With respect to Murphy, the Complainants argue the decision attempts to limit the scope of the Act contrary to the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada for interpreting human rights legislation (Winnipeg School Division No. 1 v. Craton, [1985] 2 SCR 150 [Craton]; CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 1114 [Action Travail des Femmes]; Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 SCR 143 [Andrews]; and, Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program), 2006 SCC 14 [Tranchemontagne]. Additionally, the Complainants are of the view that the Tribunal is bound, under the doctrine of stare decisis, to follow these decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and, therefore, should not consider the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy.\n[22] The Complainants are of the view that the Respondent\u2019s position, that this complaint should be dismissed because it does not arise in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d, is contradictory to Canada\u2019s membership in the United Nations and its commitments under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, GA Res. 217(III), UN GAOR, 3d Sess., Supp. No. 13, UN Doc. A\/810 (1948) 71, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, GA Res. 61\/295, UN GAOR, 61st Sess., Supp. No. 49 Vol. III, UN Doc. A\/61\/49 (2007). According to the Complainants, Canada must abide by these international commitments to guide its domestic laws, tribunals and obligations to its citizens.\n[23] The Complainants add that Canada has responded domestically to its international commitments by repealing section 67 of the Act (Bill C-21, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, 2nd Sess., 39th Parl., 2008 [Bill C-21]). Bill C-21, at section 1.1, also included recognition for existing Aboriginal and treaty rights; and, at section 1.2, provided for the Tribunal to have regard for First Nations legal traditions and customary laws when interpreting and applying the Act in relation to complaints made against a First Nation government. According to the Complainants, the intent and purpose behind the repeal of section 67, and the inclusion of sections 1.1 and 1.2 in Bill C-21, was to open up the whole of the Indian Act to full scrutiny under the Act.\n[24] On this basis, the Complainants also distinguish some of the cases relied upon by the Respondent for the proposition that legislation cannot be challenged under the Act, namely Forward v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 5 [Forward], Canada (Attorney General) v. McKenna, [1999] 1 FC 401 [McKenna], and Canada (Attorney General) v. Bouvier, 1998 CanLII 7409 (FCA) [Bouvier]. According to the Complainants, the repeal of section 67 is the distinguishing factor between the current complaints and those cases, which were decided prior to the repeal.\n[25] Finally, the Complainants submit the complaints should proceed because of their significant public impact. In the Complainants\u2019 view, the amendments to the Indian Act brought about by the GEIRA did not redress or rectify the distinction between the descendants of Indian women and men. Both before and after the passing of the GEIRA, the Indian Act does not provide them with section 6(1) status, as would have been the case in their hypothetical comparative patralineal scenario. As such, they are still unable to pass their status along to their children with non-Indians.\n[26] According to the Complainants, Parliament had an opportunity to address gender based discrimination in the GEIRA, but rejected an amendment proposed by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development that would have provided that \u201cany person born prior to 17 April 1985 and is a direct descendant of a person registered or entitled to be registered under the Indian Act may also be so entitled\u201d (Library of Parliament, Legislative Summary of Bill C-3: Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act by Mary C. Hurley & Tonina Simeone, Social Affairs Division, Parliamentary Information and Research Service (Ottawa: Library of Parliament, 2010) at 1). This amendment was ruled to exceed the scope of the bill and was therefore inadmissible (Legislative Summary of Bill C-3: Gender Equity in Indian Registration Act at 1).\n[27] The Complainants state that the total number of individuals potentially impacted by the complaint (maternal grandchildren and their offspring) can be estimated at 108,000-130,500.\nB. The Commission [28] The Commission submits this complaint is not a challenge to legislation. It challenges the act of applying the discriminatory registration provisions of the Indian Act to members of the public. However, the Commission does agree that the impugned provision required the Respondent\u2019s officials to reach the conclusions they did concerning the registration entitlements of the Complainants.\n[29] According to the Commission, determining eligibility for registration is a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the Act: registration as an Indian provides tangible and intangible benefits, and is held out to the public accordingly, in the context of a public relationship. Furthermore, persons seeking to be registered under the Indian Act are required to submit applications to the Office of the Indian Registrar.\n[30] That said, the Commission also submits that the Act allows for complaints challenging the discriminatory impact of other federal laws. It argues Supreme Court of Canada case law states human rights legislation renders inconsistent laws inoperable (Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 SCR 145 [Heerspink]; Craton; Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al, 2004 SCC 30 [Larocque]; and, Tranchemontagne). According to the Commission, where there is a conflict between human rights law and other legislation, the human rights law will govern as a quasi-constitutional statement of public policy, and will supersede inconsistent legislation, unless the legislature has clearly stated otherwise in express and unequivocal language. In the circumstances of this case, the Commission submits that the Tribunal must give due regard to the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncements concerning the effect and status of human rights laws.\n[31] With respect to Murphy, the Commission acknowledges that on its face, this decision would be a full answer to the present complaints, which are aimed at government conduct that was mandatory under the registration provisions of the Indian Act. However, up until the decision in Murphy, the Commission submits that a long line of case law within the federal human rights system had recognized the Act as having primacy over other inconsistent laws, consistent with the principles set out in cases like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne (Canada (Attorney General) v. Druken, [1989] 2 FC 24 (C.A.) [Druken (FCA)]; Gonzalez v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), [1997] 3 FC 646 [Gonzalez]; McAllister-Windsor v. Canada (Human Resources Development), 2001 CanLII 20691 (CHRT) [McAllister-Windsor]; Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 FC 569 [Uzoaba]; the dissenting reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. in Bhinder v. CN, [1985] 2 SCR 561 [Bhinder]; and, the dissenting reasons of McLachlin J. and L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. in Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 SCR 854 [Cooper]).\n[32] According to the Commission, in Murphy the Court did not apply its own jurisprudence describing the limited circumstances in which it is appropriate for one panel to overturn a previous decision by another panel. Furthermore, the Federal Court of Appeal did not deal with or mention contrary Supreme Court of Canada case law like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is faced with two contradictory lines of authority from higher decision-makers. The Commission submits that under the principles of vertical stare decisis the Tribunal must follow the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada. The Commission adds, while an application for leave to appeal Murphy was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada, this does not indicate agreement with the decision below.\n[33] According to the Commission, following the Supreme Court of Canada authorities would also keep the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence in line with other decisions from human rights tribunals and courts from across the country that have found discriminatory legislation to be inoperable.\n[34] The Commission also points to the wording and legislative history of several current provisions of the Act as demonstrating Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation: section 2 and subsections 49(5) and 62(1). According to the Commission, the presumption against tautology dictates that Parliament did not speak in vain when it enacted subsections 49(5) and 62(1) of the Act, and that applying the Act to the wording of other federal laws was therefore Parliament\u2019s intention. The Commission notes, the Federal Court of Appeal did not refer to section 2, nor subsections 49(5) or 62(1), in its decision in Murphy.\n[35] The Commission also points to the wording and legislative history of the former section 67 of the Act. According to the Commission, the former section 67 functioned as a statutory exception to the general principle that human rights laws have primacy. The existence of section 67 implied that, without the exemption, the Act would have applied to and affected any discriminatory provisions in the Indian Act. In fact, the Commission submits that Parliament enacted the former section 67 for the purpose of shielding the registration provisions of the Indian Act from review under the Act. Therefore, in repealing section 67 in 2008, Parliament intended to open the door to human rights complaints challenging discriminatory aspects of those same provisions.\n[36] Again, the Commission argues that the presumption against tautology arises with respect to section 67 and its repeal, and that the Respondent\u2019s position, that the registration provisions of the Indian Act cannot be challenged under the Act, violates this presumption. Therefore, to give effect to Parliament\u2019s intent, the Tribunal must accept that the granting of Indian status is a \u201cservice customarily available to the general public\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the Act.\nC. The Respondent [37] The Respondent submits that in any complaint it is critical for the Tribunal to properly understand and characterize what the complaint is about. To the extent that the Commission and Complainants attempt to characterize the complaint as involving the review and processing of applications for registration by officials in the Office of the Indian Registrar, the Respondent argues the Tribunal should reject such a characterization. The arguments and supporting evidence are not directed at the conduct of officials in the Office of the Indian Registrar, the exercise of discretion, or at the implementation of departmental policies and practices. According to the Respondent, in reviewing the Complainants\u2019 applications for registration as Indians, the officials did nothing more than apply categorical statutory criteria to undisputed facts. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the complaints are directed solely at an Act of Parliament and nothing else.\n[38] The Respondent also points to the Complainants\u2019 position regarding the changes to the Indian Act following the GEIRA. According to the Respondent, the fact that a legislative amendment could have potentially resolved the complaint, and not a change in policy or other factors, further indicates that the complaints are directed at legislation. Furthermore, the Complainants filed a Notice of Constitutional question in this case challenging the constitutional validity of section 6 of the Indian Act. In the Notice, they stated \u201cBill C-3 failed to properly remedy the discrimination found unconstitutional in McIvor\u201d. In the Respondent\u2019s view, this is another example which demonstrates that the complaints are based on the wording of legislation.\n[39] As a result of the application of Murphy, and other decisions such as Forward, McKenna and Bouvier, the Respondent submits the complaints should be dismissed. According to the Respondent, those decisions indicate that the Act does not provide for the filling of a complaint against legislation.\n[40] As opposed to the Supreme Court of Canada cases relied upon by the Complainants and Commission, the Respondent argues that the decision in Murphy specifically dealt with and interpreted the Act. The Respondent adds, the interpretation of particular legislative provisions of the Act by a higher court takes precedence over extrinsic statutory interpretation evidence, such as the sources put forward by the Commission. In this regard, according to the Respondent, it is not open to the Tribunal to overturn a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, because of the doctrine of stare decisis, and it would be an error for the Tribunal to do so.\n[41] Even if the Act did provide for the filling of a complaint against an Act of Parliament, the Respondent claims the complaint should still be dismissed because it does not implicate a \u201cservice\u201d. Following the reasoning of the Tribunal in Forward, the Respondent argues that entitlement to registration as an Indian is (i) a distinct status granted by the state which has\n(ii) constitutional dimensions and (iii) to characterize it as a mere service would be to ignore its fundamental role in defining the relationship between individuals and the state. In the Respondent\u2019s view, while the processing of applications for registration may constitute a \u201cservice\u201d, Parliament\u2019s criterion for identifying the population enjoying this relationship is not. The Respondent adds, statutory interpretation of the term \u201cservices\u201d, by giving the term its plain meaning and reading it in conjunction with the rest of section 5 and the entire scheme of the Act, leads to the conclusion that entitlement to registration is not a service.\n[42] The Respondent also submits the Commission\u2019s position is flawed considering the scope of the Act\u2019s analytic framework. If the Tribunal were to accept that there is a \u201cservice\u201d in this case, it would put the government in the position of having to justify its legislation on the basis of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to the point of \u201cundue hardship\u201d and limited by subsection 15(2) of the Act to considerations of \u201chealth, safety and cost\u201d. According to the Respondent, the legislative provisions at issue resulted from years of study, debate and consultation with Aboriginal groups. They were a balanced compromise between competing interests, and take into account complex demographic and historical considerations. Considerations of health and safety are not part of those factors. This leaves only one possible consideration: cost. According to the Respondent, it is loathe to advance a financial undue hardship justification given its reductive, dehumanizing nature, and the fact that non-monetary factors were important and powerful factors in the choice made by Parliament to delineate who is a status Indian.\n[43] The Respondent adds, in Alberta v. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37 [Hutterian Brethren], the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that the reasonable accommodation standard is not appropriate for evaluating laws of general application and is only helpful where a government action or administrative practice is impugned. Contrary to the Complainants and Commission\u2019s argument that Murphy is inconsistent with Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, the Respondent submits that Hutterian Brethren supports the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy that the Act does not provide for the filing of a complaint directed solely at an Act of Parliament.\n[44] Therefore, the Respondent argues the Act does not provide the scope to properly assess certain kinds of government decision-making and action. In the present situation, the Respondent is of the view that the government is entitled to justify the law not by showing reasonable accommodation, but by a section 1 analysis under the Charter.\nV. Analysis A. Is the complaint a challenge to legislation and nothing else? [45] Section 5 of the Act provides:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[46] The first step to be performed in applying section 5 is to determine whether the actions complained of are \u201cin the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation\u201d (see Watkin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 170, at para. 31 [Watkin]). According to the Complainants and the Commission, the actions complained of in this case occurred in the provision of \u201cservices\u201d. Within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, \u201cservices\u201d \u201c\u2026contemplate something of benefit being \u201cheld out\u201d as services and \u201coffered\u201d to the public\u201d (Watkin at para. 31). Neither the Complainants nor the Commission took issue with the general criteria currently used to determine whether conduct is with respect to a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the Act.\n[47] On the other hand, the Respondent argues the present complaint does not take issue with the provision of any \u201cservices\u201d; but, rather, is a strict challenge to legislation, the Indian Act. In Murphy, the Federal Court of Appeal held that \u201cthe [Act] does not provide for the filing of a complaint directed against an act of Parliament\u2026\u201d (at para. 6). Relying on the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Forward, and subsection 40(1) (\u201c\u2026which authorizes the filing of complaints\u2026\u201d) and sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act (\u201c\u2026which sets out the \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d against which complaints may be directed\u2026\u201d), the Federal Court of Appeal found that attacks \u201c\u2026aimed at the legislation per se, and nothing else\u201d fall \u201c\u2026outside the scope of the [Act]\u2026\u201d (see Murphy at para. 6). With reference to the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Wignall v. Canada (Department of National Revenue (Taxation)), 2003 FC 1280, the Federal Court of Appeal added: \u201can attempt pursuant to the [Act] to counter the application of [legislation] based solely on its alleged discriminatory impact on the complainant, could not succeed; only a constitutional challenge could yield this result\u201d (Murphy at para. 6).\n[48] It is within the above context that the Tribunal seeks to determine whether the present complaint is a challenge to legislation and nothing else; or, whether a discriminatory practice in the provision of services, under section 5 of the Act, is impugned.\n[49] In his Complaint Form, dated November 25, 2008, Jeremy Matson describes his complaint as follows:\nI believe that the [2nd Generation cut off rule] resulting from Bill C-31 is discriminatory towards me and my siblings based both the prohibited grounds of family status and gender under the Canadian Human Rights Act in that Bill C-31 continues to distinguish and discriminate against the descendants of Indian women who married non-Indian men by limiting the extension of status eligibility to a certain tier of lineage that would not apply to male Indians of the same heritage.\nTo clarify, if my grandmother had married an Indian, she would not have been disenfranchised and both my father and me would have been eligible for full status as Indians.\n(at p.3)\n[50] Following the enactment of the GEIRA and the Complainants\u2019 registrations under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act, the Complainants revised their Statement of Particulars. Therein, the Complainants described their complaint as follows:\nAlthough the Complainants are now registered as status Indians, the section under which they are registered does not allow them to pass on their status to their children equally to those status Indians in the comparator group.\nThe Complainants were previously denied registration for Indian status and the rights and benefits conferred with such status. It is the Complainants\u2019 position that such previous denial and now the s. 6(2) Indian status that has been granted to them have not put the Complainants on the same footing as the paternal Indian grandchildren; this distinction is in contravention of section 5 of the Act.\nThe nature of this discrimination arises out of the system of registration established pursuant to April 17, 1985 known as Bill C-31 and the consequent amendments to the Indian Act of April 17, 1985 and the current Gender Equity in the Indian Registration Act (Bill C-3\/McIvor) as of January 31, 2011. Under the 1985 registration, Nora Johnson was unable to pass on her Indian heritage to her descendants in the same and equal manner to those of her male counterparts while the nature of the status of other Indians was enhanced by the amendments following Bill C-31. Under Bill C-3\/McIvor, Nora Johnson is still unable to pass on her Indian heritage to her descendents in the same and equal manner of those of her male counterparts.\n(Revised Statement of Particulars of the Complainants, dated June 28, 2011, at p. 9)\n[51] In the Complainants\u2019 written submissions on stage one of this matter, the complaint is described as follows:\nThe Complaint alleges discrimination based on the manner in which they were registered as Indians under the Indian Act and the benefits and rights associated with such registration.\n[\u2026]\nThe Complainants submit that their entitlement to registration as Indians is service as defined in the CHRA [\u2026]\nThe Complainants submit that the registration of Canadian Citizen as an Indian under the Indian Act is a service, this service includes the determination of who is or who is not entitled to be registered as an Indian.\n(Complainants\u2019 Written Submissions, dated January 14, 2013, at paras. 1, 8)\n[52] During oral argument at the stage one hearing, the Complainants also stated the following with regard to the nature of their complaints:\nMember Lustig: But what\u2019s at issue here is [\u2026] the most recent letters that have gone out with respect to the applications of your children and your siblings\u2019 children; and, in those letters they\u2019re denied registration rights on the basis of the Act as it now stands after C-3; and, I\u2019m trying to ask or I\u2019m trying to find out whether you\u2019re questioning that as discrimination in the provision of service or you\u2019re questioning the Parliament\u2019s establishment of a set of rules that don\u2019t include your children as status Indians.\nJeremy Matson: I have to question Parliament, yes, cause Parliament had all the information in front of them, they had witnesses about Bill C-3. I was even going to be a witness before the Senate and I described certain discrimination that we go into this in further detail [\u2026] Parliament passed legislation with discriminatory aspects, the Senate told the House of Commons there\u2019s discrimination in it; so, yes, Parliament itself is guilty in my mind and the Indian Act and the process of becoming an Indian and so forth.\n(Audio recording of hearing held on January 30, 2013, at 51:30)\n[53] Further on in their oral submissions the Complainants also stated:\nMember Lustig: Again, the action in your mind, the action taken, that would be the action of the federal government in not broadening the definition after McIvor to include by legislative changes your children; or, not children, your status so that your children could have that status.\nJeremy Matson: Yes, like we had talked about, that Parliamentary committees, the Senate and other parties, the NDP, the Liberal, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, all those aboriginal affairs critics and individuals involved in those amendments to Bill C-3 had provided 6(1) status to us and 6(2) status for our children.\nMember Lustig: And, if that had happened?\nJeremy Matson: This complaint would have been shut down.\nMember Lustig: We would have been finished?\nJeremy Matson: Yes, we would have been finished.\n(Audio recording of hearing held on January 30, 2013, at 56:00)\n[54] Based on all the above statements from the Complainants, I believe the present complaint can properly be characterized as a challenge to legislation, namely section 6 of the Indian Act, and nothing else. The essence of this complaint, in my opinion, is that the Complainants are of the view that section 6 of the Indian Act needs to be amended, as per the proposed amendment that was rejected by the House of Commons Committee on Northern Affairs and Aboriginal Development, described in paragraph 26 above. In fact, the Complainants have admitted as much, as referred to in the hearing excerpts at paragraphs 52 and 53 above. The criteria entitling a person to be registered, or not registered, as an Indian under section 6 of the Indian Act is not a service. It is legislation enacted by Parliament. Pursuant to Murphy, legislation is not a service.\n[55] While the Commission characterizes the complaint as a challenge to the act of applying the discriminatory registration provisions of the Indian Act to members of the public; they also agree that the impugned provisions required the Respondent\u2019s officials to reach the conclusions that they did concerning the entitlements of the Complainants. I do not accept this characterization of the complaint. The evidence and argument in this case was not directed at any wrongdoing by the Respondent, but focused on the alleged discriminatory impact of the entitlement provisions of section 6 of the Indian Act.\n[56] The Respondent does not have any involvement in determining the criteria for entitlement to be registered, or not registered, as an Indian under section 6 of the Indian Act. Nor does the Respondent have any discretion in determining entitlement to be registered, or not registered, as an Indian pursuant to the criteria in section 6 of the Indian Act. Entitlement has been determined by Parliament, not the Respondent, through section 6 of the Indian Act; and, the Respondent must follow this section in processing applications for registration. Sections 2 and 5 of the Indian Act make this clear:\n2. (1) In this Act, [\u2026]\n\u201cIndian\u201d means a person who pursuant to this Act is registered as an Indian or is entitled to be registered as an Indian; [\u2026]\n\u201cRegistrar\u201d means the officer in the Department who is in charge of the Indian Register and the Band Lists maintained in the Department;\n[\u2026]\n5. (1) There shall be maintained in the Department an Indian Register in which shall be recorded the name of every person who is entitled to be registered as an Indian under this Act.\n(2) The names in the Indian Register immediately prior to April 17, 1985 shall constitute the Indian Register on April 17, 1985.\n(3) The Registrar may at any time add to or delete from the Indian Register the name of any person who, in accordance with this Act, is entitled or not entitled, as the case may be, to have his name included in the Indian Register.\n(4) The Indian Register shall indicate the date on which each name was added thereto or deleted therefrom.\n(5) The name of a person who is entitled to be registered is not required to be recorded in the Indian Register unless an application for registration is made to the Registrar.\n[57] As the definition of \u201cIndian\u201d and subsection 5(5) of the Indian Act indicate, entitlement and registration are two separate things. Entitlement is predetermined by the Indian Act, regardless of registration; whereas registration in the Indian Register is the result of an application process through the Registrar\/Department.\n[58] The Respondent does not offer to the public the benefit of entitlement to registration under section 6 of the Indian Act, or the corresponding tangible and intangible benefits that may go along with entitlement to registration. It is the Indian Act itself that offers the benefit of entitlement to registration and it is Parliament who has applied the entitlement provisions of the Indian Act to the public, not the Respondent. What the Respondent may offer as a benefit\/service to the public is the processing of applications for registration to determine whether a person should be added to the Indian Register, in accordance with the Indian Act. This involves the Indian Registrar receiving applications for registration, reviewing the information in the application to determine whether it is complete and accurate; and, assessing the application to determine whether or not the applicant satisfies the entitlement provisions of section 6 of the Indian Act. The Complainants do not allege discrimination in the Respondent\u2019s performance of any of these functions. As noted, the result of this process is that either the applicant is added to the Indian Register as being entitled to status as an Indian under the Indian Act or he is not. While the processing of an application by the Registrar as described above may be a service, the resulting status or lack thereof is not.\n[59] As is clear from the Complainants\u2019 submissions, it is not the Respondent\u2019s processing of the Complainants\u2019 applications that is being challenged in this case. Rather, it is the Complainants\u2019 entitlement to registration, pursuant to section 6 of the Indian Act, which gives rise to the present complaint. The sole source of the alleged discrimination in this case is the legislative language of section 6 of the Indian Act. In reviewing the Complainants\u2019 applications for registration, the Respondent\u2019s officials did nothing more than apply categorical statutory criteria to undisputed facts. Any issue taken with the application review process is really an issue taken with section 6 of the Indian Act.\n[60] Therefore, for the above reasons, I would answer the first question in the affirmative and find the present complaint to be a challenge to legislation, namely section 6 of the Indian Act, and nothing else.\nB. Is the Tribunal bound to follow the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Murphy, and dismiss the complaint? [61] Having found the current complaint to be a challenge to section 6 of the Indian Act, and nothing else, the reasoning in Murphy would suggest the complaint should be dismissed as being beyond the scope of the Act. However, the Complainants and the Commission argue that Murphy is superseded by binding case law from the Supreme Court of Canada, finding that the primacy of human rights laws render inconsistent legislation inoperable. On this basis, it is argued that the Act allows for complaints challenging the discriminatory impact of other federal laws; and, therefore, the Tribunal should decline to apply Murphy.\n[62] In support of its argument, the Commission also points to case law within the federal human rights system, which it claims recognizes the Act as having primacy over other inconsistent laws. Furthermore, according to the Commission, following the Supreme Court of Canada authorities would keep the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence in line with other decisions from human rights tribunals and courts from across the country that have found discriminatory legislation to be inoperable.\n[63] In addition, the Commission argues that current provisions in the Act demonstrate Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation. On top of that, both the Complainants and the Commission claim that by repealing section 67 of the Act, Parliament intended to open the door to human rights complaints challenging discriminatory aspects of the Indian Act.\n[64] Each argument will be addressed in turn.\n(i) Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence regarding the interpretation and primacy of human rights laws [65] As mentioned above, the Supreme Court of Canada cases relied upon by the Complainants and the Commission are: Heerspink; Craton; Action Travail des Femmes; Andrews; Larocque; and, Tranchemontagne.\nHeerspink [66] The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia terminated the insurance coverage on Mr. Heerspink\u2019s buildings, without reason, after the press reported his committal to trial on a charge of trafficking in marijuana. Section 208 of the Insurance Act of British Columbia provided that the Insurance Corporation could terminate the contract upon giving the required notice. Mr. Heerspink filed a complaint under section 3 of the Human Rights Code of British Columbia alleging that insurance coverage had been denied without reasonable cause. Section 3 provided that reasonable cause was necessary to deny a person or class of persons a service customarily available to the public. A Board of Inquiry found that the Human Rights Code had been violated.\n[67] Laskin C.J. and Ritchie and Dickson JJ (as they then were) agreed with the finding of the Board of Inquiry. Lamer J, writing also for Estey and McIntyre JJ (as they then were) concurred in the reasons of Ritchie, but added the following comments:\nWhen the subject matter of a law is said to be the comprehensive statement of the \u201chuman rights\u201d of the people living in that jurisdiction, then there is no doubt in my mind that the people of that jurisdiction have through their legislature clearly indicated that they consider that law, and the values it endeavours to buttress and protect, are, save their constitutional laws, more important than all others. Therefore, short of that legislature speaking to the contrary in express and unequivocal language in the Code or in some other enactment, it is intended that the Code supersede all other laws when conflict arises.\nAs a result, the legal proposition generalia specialibus non derogant cannot be applied to such a code. Indeed the Human Rights Code, when in conflict with \u201cparticular and specific legislation\u201d, is not to be treated as another ordinary law of general application. It should be recognized for what it is, a fundamental law.\nFurthermore, as it is a public and fundamental law, no one, unless clearly authorized by law to do so, may contractually agree to suspend its operation and thereby put oneself beyond the reach of its protection.\nTherefore, whilst agreeing with my brother Ritchie that \u201cthe two statutory enactments under review can stand together as there is no direct conflict between them\u201d, I should add that were there such a conflict, the Code would govern. I find nowhere in the laws of British Columbia that s. 5 of the Statutory Conditions set forth in s. 208 of the Insurance Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, c. 197, as amended, is to be given any special treatment under the Human Rights Code.\n(Heerspink at pp. 157-158)\n[68] These comments speak to conflict between human rights legislation and \u201cparticular and specific legislation\u201d. While the Supreme Court found that both statutory enactments could stand together; if they could not, the Court indicated that the human rights legislation would govern. However, as opposed to the Matson complaints, Mr. Heerspink\u2019s complaint was not aimed at the Insurance Act itself, but at the denial of insurance, as a service: \u201cI can see no reason why insurance was not intended by the legislature to be a \u201cservice\u201d in the sense in which the word is used in s. 3 of the Code\u201d (Heerspink at p. 159). Nor do the Supreme Court\u2019s comments indicate that a complaint challenging legislation, and nothing else, is possible under human rights legislation. The basis of Mr. Heerspink\u2019s complaint was that he was denied a \u201cservice\u201d, contrary to section 3 of the Human Rights Code. The potential conflict between the two statutes only arose when the Insurance Corporation argued that it had the right to terminate insurance coverage, without reasonable cause, pursuant to section 208 of the Insurance Act.\nCraton [69] The Public Schools Act in Manitoba allowed for the fixing of a compulsory retirement age for teachers. Ms. Craton, a teacher, was required by her collective agreement to retire following her sixty-fifth birthday. She successfully sought a declaration in the Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench that mandatory retirement contravened subsection 6(1) of the Human Rights Act of Manitoba and was invalid, and that her employment therefore could not be terminated. Subsection 6(1) of The Human Rights Act provided:\n6 (1) Every person has the right of equality of opportunity based upon bona fide qualifications in respect of his occupation or employment or in respect of training for employment or in respect of an intended occupation, employment, advancement or promotion, and in respect of his membership or intended membership in a trade union, employers' organization or occupational association; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing\n(a) no employer or person acting on behalf of an employer, shall refuse to employ, or to continue to employ or to train the person for employment or to advance or promote that person, or discriminate against that person in respect of employment or any term or condition of employment;\n[\u2026]\nbecause of race, nationality, religion, colour, sex, age, marital status, physical or mental handicap, ethnic or national origin, or political beliefs or family status of that person.\n[70] At issue before the Supreme Court was the conflict between the provisions of the Human Rights Act and the Public Schools Act, which was enacted before and consolidated after the Human Rights Act. The Supreme Court found the Public Schools Act could not be considered a later enactment having the effect of creating an exception to the provisions of the Human Rights Act. Specifically, the Supreme Court stated:\nHuman rights legislation is of a special nature and declares public policy regarding matters of general concern. Is is not constitutional in nature in the sense that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed by the Legislature. It is, however, of such nature that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed, nor may exceptions be created to its provisions, save by clear legislative pronouncement. To adopt and apply any theory of implied repeal by later statutory enactment to legislation of this kind would be to rob it of its special nature and give scant protection to the rights it proclaims. In this case it cannot be said that s. 50 of the 1980 consolidation is a sufficiently express indication of a legislative intent to create an exception to the provisions of s. 6(1) of The Human Rights Act.\n(Craton at p. 156)\n[71] While the Supreme Court in Craton found there was a conflict between the human rights legislation and the Public Schools Act, and that the latter did not create an exception to the Human Rights Act, that finding is couched in the terms of paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act. The basis of Ms. Craton\u2019s action was not the conflict between paragraph 6(1)(a) and the Public Schools Act, but that her employer refused to continue to employ her because of age, contrary to paragraph 6(1)(a). The conflict between the two statutes only arose when the Winnipeg School Division argued it had the right to enforce mandatory retirement pursuant to the Public Schools Act. Again, as with Heerspink, the comments of the Supreme Court in Craton do not indicate that a complaint challenging legislation, and nothing else, is possible under human rights legislation. The existence of a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d, pursuant to the applicable legislation, was still present.\nAction Travail des Femmes [72] Action Travail des Femmes alleged Canadian National Railway Company (CN) was guilty of discriminatory hiring and promotion practices contrary to section 10 of the former Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 1976-77, c. 33, by denying employment opportunities to women in certain unskilled blue-collar positions. A Human Rights Tribunal found that the recruitment, hiring and promotion policies at CN prevented and discouraged women from working on blue-collar jobs. The Tribunal imposed a special employment program on CN, including a requirement that CN increase to 13 percent the proportion of women working in non-traditional occupations, and until that goal was achieved, to hire at least one woman for every four non-traditional jobs filled in the future.\n[73] Before the Supreme Court, the appeal was to determine whether the Tribunal had the power, under paragraph 41(2)(a) of the former Act, to impose upon an employer an \"employment equity program\" to address the problem of \"systemic discrimination\" in the hiring and promotion of a disadvantaged group, in this case women. To make this determination, the Supreme Court was required to interpret paragraph 41(2)(a), and stated the following with regard to the \u201c\u2026proper interpretive attitude towards human rights codes and acts\u201d (Action Travail des Femmes at p. 1133):\nHuman rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n[\u2026]\nThe purposes of the Act would appear to be patently obvious, in light of the powerful language of s. 2. In order to promote the goal of equal opportunity for each individual to achieve \"the life that he or she is able and wishes to have\", the Act seeks to prevent all \"discriminatory practices\" based, inter alia, on sex. It is the practice itself which is sought to be precluded. The purpose of the Act is not to punish wrongdoing but to prevent discrimination.\n[\u2026]\nThe first comprehensive judicial statement of the correct attitude towards the interpretation of human rights legislation can be found in Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 158, where Lamer J. emphasized that a human rights code \"is not to be treated as another ordinary law of general application. It should be recognized for what it is, a fundamental law\". This principle of interpretation was further articulated by McIntyre J., for a unanimous Court, in Winnipeg School Division No. I v. Craton\u2026\n[\u2026]\nThe emphasis upon the \"special nature\" of human rights enactments was a strong indication of the Court's general attitude to the interpretation of such legislation.\n(Action Travail des Femmes at pp. 1134, 1135-1136)\n[74] Based on this interpretive approach, the Supreme Court concluded that the order made by the Tribunal was within its jurisdiction under paragraph 41(2)(a) of the former Act.\n[75] The statements of the Supreme Court in Action Travail des Femmes are with regard to the proper interpretive attitude toward human rights legislation. It does not address the issue of primacy or whether a complaint challenging legislation, and nothing else, properly falls within the jurisdiction of the Act. While instructive, the interpretive principles enunciated in Action Travail des Femmes would only seem to be relevant to the circumstances of this case in so much as they should be considered in the interpretation of the term \u201cservices\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act (for example, see Watkin at paras. 33-34).\nAndrews [76] Mr. Andrews, a British subject permanently resident in Canada, met all the requirements for admission to the British Columbia bar except that of Canadian citizenship. His action for a declaration that that requirement violated subsection 15(1) of the Charter was dismissed at trial but allowed on appeal. The questions before the Supreme Court were: (1) whether the Canadian citizenship requirement for admission to the British Columbia bar infringed or denied the equality rights guaranteed by subsection 15(1) of the Charter; and, if so, (2) whether that infringement was justified by section 1. A majority of the Supreme Court found the Canadian citizenship requirement to infringe subsection 15(1) of the Charter and could not be justified by section 1.\n[77] The Complainants rely on the following statement from the reasons of McIntyre and Lamer JJ (as they then were):\nDiscrimination is unacceptable in a democratic society because it epitomizes the worst effects of the denial of equality, and discrimination reinforced by law is particularly repugnant. The worst oppression will result from discriminatory measures having the force of law.\n(Andrews at p. 172)\n[78] The sentence following this quote is:\nIt is against this evil that s. 15 provides a guarantee.\n(Andrews at p. 172)\n[79] McIntyre J\u2019s reasons go on to state:\nThe Court in the case at bar must address the issue of discrimination as the term is used in s. 15(1) of the Charter. In general, it may be said that the principles which have been applied under the Human Rights Acts are equally applicable in considering questions of discrimination under s. 15(1). Certain differences arising from the difference between the Charter and the Human Rights Acts must, however, be considered. To begin with, discrimination in s. 15(1) is limited to discrimination caused by the application or operation of law, whereas the Human Rights Acts apply also to private activities.\n[\u2026]\nWhere discrimination is forbidden in the Human Rights Acts it is done in absolute terms, and where a defence or exception is allowed it, too, speaks in absolute terms and the discrimination is excused. There is, in this sense, no middle ground. In the Charter, however, while s. 15(1), subject always to subs. (2), expresses its prohibition of discrimination in absolute terms, s. 1 makes allowance for a reasonable limit upon the operation of s. 15(1). A different approach under s. 15(1) is therefore required. While discrimination under s. 15(1) will be of the same nature and in descriptive terms will fit the concept of discrimination developed under the Human Rights Acts, a further step will be required in order to decide whether discriminatory laws can be justified under s. 1. The onus will be on the state to establish this. This is a distinct step called for under the Charter which is not found in most Human Rights Acts, because in those Acts justification for or defence to discrimination is generally found in specific exceptions to the substantive rights.\n(Andrews at pp. 175, 176)\n[80] Given the distinction created between human rights legislation and the Charter in McIntyre\u2019s reasoning, including the statement that it is section 15 of the Charter that provides a guarantee against discriminatory measures having the force of law, Andrews does not appear to support the argument that legislation, and nothing else, can be challenged under the Act. Rather, Andrews seems to suggest that, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of applicable human rights legislation, it is the Charter that deals with discrimination caused by the application or operation of law, as suggested in Murphy.\nLarocque [81] Mr. Larocque was excluded from the hiring process for a position as a municipal police officer because he did not meet the minimum standard for hearing acuity adopted by the City of Montreal pursuant to the regulatory powers given to it by its enabling Act. He filed a complaint with the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse, alleging that the refusal to hire him constituted discrimination in violation of sections 10 and 16 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The matter was brought forward to the Quebec Tribunal des droits de la personne, who concluded that it could not find the City liable for damages resulting from the application of its legislative and regulatory powers. However, it declared the regulatory standard inoperable in relation to the complainant and directed the City to reconsider the complainant\u2019s application in accordance with the hiring process as it was at the time he applied with all of the benefits to which he would have been entitled had he not been excluded. The Quebec Court of Appeal limited the remedy to a mere declaration of the standard\u2019s inoperability in relation to the complainant.\n[82] Sections 10 and 16 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, R.S.Q. c. C-12, provide:\n10. Every person has a right to full and equal recognition and exercise of his human rights and freedoms, without distinction, exclusion or preference based on race, colour, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, civil status, age except as provided by law, religion, political convictions, language, ethnic or national origin, social condition, a handicap or the use of any means to palliate a handicap.\nDiscrimination exists where such a distinction, exclusion or preference has the effect of nullifying or impairing such right.\n16. No one may practise discrimination in respect of the hiring, apprenticeship, duration of the probationary period, vocational training, promotion, transfer, displacement, laying-off, suspension, dismissal or conditions of employment of a person or in the establishment of categories or classes of employment.\n[83] The appeal to the Supreme Court concerned the scope of the remedial powers that the Quebec Tribunal des droits de la personne may exercise under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. The Court stated:\nThe nature of Canada\u2019s constitutional regime must be taken into consideration when establishing the hierarchy of rules governing the actions of legislatures and public entities, such as municipalities, to which legislative powers have been validly delegated. The ultimate source of traditional immunities with respect to the consequences of the invalidity of legislative action is this constitutional regime, a regime in which legislative power is necessarily exercised within the confines of the law, but independently, free of interference from the civil liability rules of the jus commune. The Quebec Charter, a statute with quasi-constitutional standing in matters within the Quebec legislature\u2019s jurisdiction, is enforced within this legal framework and is still based on the fundamental organizing principles for public powers inspired by this framework.\n(Larocque at para. 17)\n[84] In this regard, the Court held that \u201cwell-established principles of public law rule out the possibility of awarding damages when legislation is declared unconstitutional\u2026\u201d (Larocque at para. 19). Therefore, damages could not be awarded against the City for the discriminatory affects of its by-law on Mr. Larocque. However, the Court found that a declaration of inoperability of the City\u2019s by-law, and an order compelling the City to reconsider Mr. Larocque\u2019s application in accordance with the rules for hiring police officers currently in force, but without taking into account his hearing loss, would be an appropriate remedy under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms.\n[85] Similar to the situation in Craton, the Supreme Court in Larocque found there to be a conflict between human rights legislation and a municipal by-law adopted pursuant to legislation. The result was that, to the extent of the conflict, the municipal by-law was rendered inoperable. However, again similar to Craton, Mr. Larocque\u2019s complaint was couched in terms of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d pursuant to sections 10 and 16 of the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms. His complaint was that he was discriminated against in respect of hiring. The City advanced a justification based on its authority under the by-law. The conflict with the human rights legislation was not the complaint itself, but part of the analysis of the complaint. In analyzing the Quebec Tribunal\u2019s remedial jurisdiction, the comments of the Supreme Court in Larocque do not indicate that a complaint challenging legislation, and nothing else, is possible under human rights legislation. \u201cDiscrimination\u201d, pursuant to the applicable legislation, was still present.\nTranchemontagne [86] Mr. Tranchemontagne and Mr. Werbeski applied for support pursuant to the Ontario Disability Support Program Act, 1997 (ODSPA). The Director of the program denied their applications. The Social Benefits Tribunal (SBT) dismissed their appeal pursuant to subsection 5(2) of the ODSPA based on its finding that they both suffered from alcoholism. In so concluding, the SBT found that it did not have jurisdiction to consider whether subsection 5(2) was inapplicable by virtue of the Ontario Human Rights Code.\n[87] The question raised by the appeal to the Supreme Court was whether the SBT was obligated to follow provincial human rights legislation in rendering its decisions (see Tranchemontagne at para. 1). The majority concluded that the SBT had jurisdiction to consider the Ontario Human Rights Code. As the SBT can decide questions of law, it followed that it is presumed to have the jurisdiction to consider the whole law when it decides whether an applicant is eligible for income support. The SBT is presumed able to consider any legal source that might influence its decision on eligibility, including the Human Rights Code (see Tranchemontagne at para. 40). Therefore, the SBT could not decline to deal with the human rights issue and the case was remitted to the SBT so that it could rule on the applicability of subsection 5(2) of the ODSPA (see Tranchemontagne at paras. 52-53).\n[88] In reaching its conclusion, the majority of the Supreme Court stated the following with regard to the Ontario Human Rights Code:\nThe most important characteristic of the Code for the purposes of this appeal is that it is fundamental, quasi-constitutional law\u2026 Accordingly, it is to be interpreted in a liberal and purposive manner, with a view towards broadly protecting the human rights of those to whom it applies\u2026And not only must the content of the Code be understood in the context of its purpose, but like the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, it must be recognized as being the law of the people\u2026Accordingly, it must not only be given expansive meaning, but also offered accessible application.\n(Tranchemontagne at para. 33)\n[89] The majority also noted that the Ontario legislature has seen fit to bind itself and all its agents through the Human Rights Code, at subsection 47(1); and, has given the Human Rights Code primacy over all other legislative enactments, at subsection 47(2). As a result of the primacy clause, \u201cwhere provisions of the Code conflict with provisions in another provincial law, it is the provisions of the Code that are to apply\u201d (Tranchemontagne at para. 34). With regard to the primacy clause the majority stated:\nThis primacy provision has both similarities and differences with s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, which announces the supremacy of the Constitution. In terms of similarities, both provisions function to eliminate the effects of inconsistent legislation. At the end of the day, whether there is a conflict with the Code or the Constitution, the ultimate effect is that the other provision is not followed and, for the purposes of that particular application, it is as if the legislation was never enacted. But in my view, the differences between the two provisions are far more important. A provision declared invalid pursuant to s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 was never validly enacted to begin with. It never existed as valid law because the legislature enacting it never had the authority to pass it. But when a provision is inapplicable pursuant to s. 47 of the Code, there is no statement being made as to its validity. The legislature had the power to enact the conflicting provision; it just so happens that the legislature also enacted another law that takes precedence.\nThus whether a provision is constitutionally permissible, and whether it is consistent with the Code, are two separate questions involving two different kinds of scrutiny. When a tribunal or court applies s. 47 of the Code to render another law inapplicable, it is not \u201cgoing behind\u201d that law to consider its validity, as it would be if it engaged in the two activities denied the SBT by s. 67(2) of the OWA. It is not declaring that the legislature was wrong to enact it in the first place. Rather, it is simply applying the tie-breaker supplied by, and amended according to the desires of, the legislature itself. The difference between s. 47 of the Code and s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 is therefore the difference between following legislative intent and overturning legislative intent.\n(Tranchemontagne at paras. 35-36)\n[90] While Tranchemontagne is instructive regarding the interpretation and primacy of human rights legislation, the comments of the Supreme Court do not indicate that a complaint challenging legislation, and nothing else, is possible under human rights legislation. Nor did the Supreme Court implicitly accept that the payment of legislated disability support benefits could be reviewed as a \u201cservice\u201d under the Ontario Human Rights Code, as the Commission has suggested (Melody Katrina Schneider, Jeremy Eugene Matson, and Mardy Eugene Matson v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (T1444\/7009), Written Submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission for use at Stage 1 of the Tribunal Hearing (to be held January 30 to February 1, 2013), dated January 11, 2013, at para. 56).\n[91] Rather, the Supreme Court indicates that it is possible for human rights legislation to render laws inapplicable and that the SBT had the jurisdiction to consider human rights arguments in this regard. However, the Court left it to the SBT to decide the merits of any such human rights arguments. As Lebel, Deschamps and Abella JJ specified in their dissenting reasons: \u201cThe issue is not whether a party can challenge a provision of the ODSPA as being inconsistent with the Code; it is where the challenge can be made and, specifically, whether it can be made before the Director or SBT\u201d (Tranchemontagne at para. 69).\nConclusion on Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence [92] Pursuant to the analysis above, in my view, Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontage support the Complainants and Commission\u2019s claim that human rights legislation can render inoperable, legislation that is in conflict with it. However, that is not to say that the Act allows for complaints that challenge the wording of other laws, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act.\n[93] There are no comments from the Supreme Court in any of these cases that indicate that the primacy of human rights legislation equates to the ability to challenge legislation under human rights legislation. The basis of the conflict between legislation in Heerspink, Craton and Larocque was couched in the terms of a \u201cdiscrimination\u201d complaint under the applicable human rights legislation in those cases. The complaints themselves were not challenges to the wording of other laws.\n[94] In this regard, Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne are actually consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy, in the sense that the Federal Court of Appeal required there to be a \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, for there to be a valid complaint in that case.\n(ii) Other federal case law recognizing the primacy of human rights legislation [95] The Commission claims that, up until Murphy, a long line of case law within the federal human rights system had recognized the Act as having primacy over other inconsistent laws, consistent with the principles set out in cases like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne. The Commission relies on the following federal cases: Druken (FCA); Gonzalez; McAllister-Windsor; Uzoaba; the dissenting reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. in Bhinder; and, the dissenting reasons of McLachlin J. and L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. in Cooper.\nDruken (FCA) [96] Druken (FCA) was a judicial review of a Tribunal decision: Druken v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), 1987 CanLII 99 (CHRT) [Druken (CHRT)]. The complainants filed complaints under section 5 of the CHRA alleging the respondent had engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of marital and family status in the provision of services. The complainants were denied unemployment insurance benefits under paragraphs 3(2)(c) and 4(3)(d) of the Unemployment Insurance Act and paragraph 14(a) of the Unemployment Insurance Regulations because they were employed by their husbands or by companies, more than 40% of the voting shares of which, were controlled by their husbands. The Tribunal found that unemployment insurance was a service:\nI am guided by the case of Christine Morrell v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission (1985) G.C.H.R.R. 3021 in which the tribunal found that Christine Morrell was discriminated against when she was denied the continuation of regular unemployment insurance benefits because she was pregnant. I agree with the finding of the Tribunal in the Morrell case that unemployment insurance is not only a service provided by the Respondent and generally available to the public, but it is also a service which most employed members of the public are required by law to participate in. Thus, in the case before me I also find that the Complainants were denied a service customarily available to the public on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n(Druken (CHRT))\n[97] Having found that unemployment insurance was a service, according to the Tribunal, it was then faced with the task of considering a practice that is prima facie discriminatory, but which is mandated by the Unemployment Insurance Act and Regulations. In this regard, the Tribunal stated:\nThis Tribunal finds it inconceivable that the government did not anticipate a possible conflict between the Canadian Human Rights Act and other federal legislation. The fact that the Canadian Human Rights Act refers to several exceptions in its application suggests otherwise. This Tribunal supports the view expressed by Mr. Justice Ritchie, and Mr. Justice Lamer that in the absence of words contained in the Canadian Human Rights Act which expressly limits its application, such a public and fundamental law must govern over other legislation.\nNevertheless this Tribunal finds that the Canadian Human Rights Act contains provisions that are designed to deal with the potential areas of conflict between the former statute and the Unemployment Insurance Act or other federal legislation.\n[\u2026]\nIn other words the Respondent will not be engaged in a discriminatory practice in denying unemployment insurance benefits to the complainants where there is a bona fide justification for such denial.\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act can stand together.\n(Druken (CHRT))\n[98] The Tribunal concluded that the respondent did not demonstrate a bona fide justification for the denial of benefits to the complainants; and, ordered that the respondent cease the discriminatory practice of applying the impugned sections of the Unemployment Insurance Act and Regulations.\n[99] On judicial review, the Federal Court of Appeal stated the issues as follows:\nWhile they were raised in the Attorney General's factum, arguments that the provision of unemployment insurance benefits is not a service customarily available to the general public and that its denial, by virtue of paragraphs 3(2)(c) of the U.I. Act and 14(a) of the U.I. Regulations, is based on marital and\/or family status, were not pursued. The latter proposition seems so self-evident as not to call for comment. As to the former, the applicant appears to have found persuasive the dictum expressed in Singh (Re), [1989] 1 F.C. 430 (C.A.) in which it was said by Hugessen J., delivering the judgment of this Court, at page 440:\nIt is indeed arguable that the qualifying words of section 5\n5. ... provision of ... services ... customarily available to the general public\ncan only serve a limiting role in the context of services rendered by private persons or bodies; that, by definition, services rendered by public servants at public expense are services to the public and therefore fall within the ambit of section 5. It is not, however, necessary to make any final determination on the point at this stage and it is enough to state that it is not by any means clear to me that the services rendered, both in Canada and abroad, by the officers charged with the administration of the Immigration Act, 1976 are not services customarily available to the general public.\nIn any event, the tribunal's basic finding of fact that the respondents were victims of a proscribed discriminatory practice was not questioned. The principal arguments concerned whether the tribunal erred in ordering the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission, the \"CEIC\", to \"cease applying sections 3(2)(c), 4(3)(d) and Regulation 14A\", thereby effectively declaring them inoperative, and whether it erred in concluding that there was not a bona fide justification for the denial of benefits, thus bringing the discriminatory practice within the exception of paragraph 14(g). The former issue was presented on two bases: (1) that the Human Rights Act is not paramount over another Act of Parliament and (2) that an ad hoc tribunal has not the power to declare or make an order rendering legislation inoperative.\n(Druken (FCA) at pp. 28-29)\n[100] On the first issue, the Federal Court of Appeal found:\nThe rule appears to be that when human rights legislation and other legislation cannot stand together, a subsequent inconsistent enactment, unless clearly stated to create an exception to it, is not to be construed as repealing the subsisting human rights legislation. On the other hand, when the human rights legislation is the subsequent enactment, it does repeal by implication the other inconsistent legislation.\nThe circumstances here seem precisely those which, it was said, would have led to disposition of the Winnipeg School case on the basis of implied repeal. Paragraph 3(2)(c) of the U.I. Act, a provision of Canadian unemployment insurance legislation since 1941, was last enacted in 1971 (S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 48, s. 3(2)(c)). Paragraph 4(3)(d), continuing an exception first adopted in 1955, was enacted in its present form in 1975 (S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 80, s. 2). Neither has been subsequently re-enacted. Both were among \"the present laws of Canada\" when the Human Rights Act was enacted in 1977 (S.C. 1976-77, c. 33) with the intent expressed in section 2 recited above.\nIn my opinion, this application is to be disposed of on the basis that, in 1977, paragraphs 3(2)(c) and 4(3)(d) of the U.I. Act were repealed by implication upon the Human Rights Act coming into force. I think it would be quite irregular for this Court to deal with it on the hypothesis that the U.I. provisions were enacted later. The effect would be to give advisory opinions on whether, as they stand, they are sufficiently clear legislative pronouncements to create exceptions to the Human Rights Act and, if not, as section 50 of the Public Schools Act was not, whether the discriminatory practices they mandate are bona fide justified. The objections to the remedies remain.\n(Druken (FCA) at pp. 31-32)\n[101] On the issue of remedies, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded that the Tribunal had the power to declare or make an order rendering legislation inoperative, pursuant to paragraph 41(2)(a) of the Act (now paragraph 53(2)(a)).\n[102] Consistent with Heerspink, Craton and Larocque, the decisions in Druken rendered inoperable, legislation that was in conflict with the Act. However, also consistent with Heerspink, Craton and Larocque, and the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy, the basis of the conflict between legislation in Druken was couched in a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d complaint under the Act, in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d, namely unemployment insurance, as found by the Tribunal and not contested on judicial review. While Murphy puts in question the Tribunal\u2019s finding that unemployment insurance is a service, the Druken cases are consistent with the Murphy reasoning in the sense that a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d, within the meaning of the Act, was present for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a matter.\nGonzalez [103] Gonzalez involved a reference to the Federal Court, by the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the Employment and Immigration Commission, on the following question:\nIs subsection 11(7) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. U-1, contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, in that it is a discriminatory practice based on family status in the provision of services?\n(Gonzalez at para. 12)\n[104] The Federal Court began its analysis with the following caveat:\nI begin my analysis by stating that Parliament is constantly called upon to make choices, and that the mere existence of a distinction is not evocative of discrimination. Only where a distinction is made on a prohibited ground of discrimination within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA can it give rise to discriminatory treatment.\n(Gonzalez at para. 30)\n[105] In that regard, the Attorney General argued that the refusal to pay benefits results from the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Act and that the denial alleged is not the result of the actions of the Employment and Immigration Commission as a provider of services within the meaning of section 5 of the Act. On this issue, the Federal Court concluded that \u201cthis issue was rightly conceded by the Attorney General in Druken\u201d (Gonzalez at para. 36). The Federal Court added:\nDespite the fact that the Attorney General made no concession on this point in the instant reference, it seems plain to me that the unemployment insurance system is a service customarily available to the general public, and my attention was not drawn to any reason that would allow me to find that this service falls outside the ambit of section 5 on the ground that it is provided by the government.\n(Gonzalez at para. 37)\n[106] The Federal Court went on to find that subsection 11(7) of the Unemployment Insurance Act was discriminatory and that the Attorney General could not provide a bona fide justification for the discrimination. The Federal Court\u2019s declaration that subsection 11(7) was discriminatory was suspended for one year to allow Parliament to remedy the discriminatory treatment. If Parliament did not act within the time allowed, then the Employment and Immigration Commission was ordered to cease applying paragraph 11(7)(a) and the Tribunal hearing Ms. Gonzalez\u2019s complaint was ordered to dispose of it on the assumption that the paragraph was contrary to the Act.\n[107] Like Druken, and Heerspink, Craton and Larocque, the basis of the conflict between legislation in Gonzalez was couched in a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d under the Act, in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d, namely unemployment insurance. Again, while Murphy puts in question the finding that unemployment insurance is a service, Gonzalez is consistent with the Murphy reasoning in the sense that a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d, within the meaning of the Act, was present for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a matter.\nMcAllister-Windsor [108] The Unemployment Insurance Act placed a 30 week limit or cap on the number of weeks for which an individual could receive maternity, sickness and parental benefits. In Ms. McAllister-Windsor's case, the combination of her pregnancy and her disability resulted in the loss of her entitlement to parental benefits. She alleged that the cap had a discriminatory effect on her in the provision of a service customarily available to the public, by reason of her sex and disability.\n[109] In determining whether the complainant established a prima facie case, the Tribunal stated:\nThere is no dispute that the provision of EI benefits by HRDC is a 'service customarily available to the public', as contemplated by Section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n(McAllister-Windsor at para. 30)\n[110] For its proposition that there was no dispute that the provision of employment insurance benefits constituted a \u201cservice\u201d, the Tribunal relied upon the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez (see McAllister-Windsor at para. 30).\n[111] The Tribunal found that, while subsection 11(5) of the Unemployment Insurance Act was, on its face, a neutral rule, it had not just a disproportionate effect, but an exclusive adverse effect on pregnant women such as Ms. McAllister-Windsor, who had claimed employment insurance sickness benefits (see McAllister-Windsor at para. 52). It also found that the respondent, Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, failed to establish that it could not accommodate persons with the characteristics of the complainant, without incurring undue hardship (see McAllister-Windsor at para. 71). The Tribunal ordered the respondent to cease applying the provisions of subsection 11(5) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, but suspended the order for 12 months to allow Parliament to remedy the problem. The Complainant was also awarded special compensation and interest.\n[112] Like Druken and Gonzalez, and Heerspink, Craton and Larocque, the basis of the conflict between legislation in McAllister-Windsor was couched in a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d under the Act, in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d, namely unemployment insurance. Again, while Murphy puts in question the finding that unemployment insurance is a service, McAllister-Windsor is consistent with the Murphy reasoning in the sense that a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d, within the meaning of the Act, was present for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a matter.\nUzoaba [113] In Uzoaba, an application for judicial review of a Tribunal decision, the Federal Court was asked to determine, among other things, whether the Tribunal erred in ordering the reinstatement of the complainant at a level two steps higher than that held by him at the time his rights were violated. Counsel for the Attorney General argued that the Public Service Employment Act established a scheme whereby promotions are to be based on merit; and, that this cannot be overruled by the Tribunal. In rejecting this argument, the Federal Court stated:\nThe law is clear and counsel for the Attorney General agrees that in the case of a direct conflict, the Act will apply. However, he argues the conflict here is not direct. It is not clear to me how this argument assists counsel. Indeed, counsel for Dr. Uzoaba submits there is no real conflict between the Act and the Public Service Employment Act. He says that the promotion on merit provisions of the Public Service Employment Act apply in the normal, day-to-day administration of the Public Service and that the Act does not purport to displace the Public Service Employment Act in that respect. In practical terms I agree with this submission.\nHowever, even if the power of a Human Rights Tribunal to order a promotion in the Public Service conflicts with the Public Service Employment Act, I am satisfied that the provisions of the Act must prevail.\nIn Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 (the \"Action Travail des Femmes\" case), Chief Justice Dickson stated at pages 1135 and 1136:\nThe first comprehensive judicial statement of the correct attitude towards the interpretation of human rights legislation can be found in Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145, at p. 158, where Lamer J. emphasized that a human rights code \"is not to be treated as another ordinary law of general application. It should be recognized for what it is, a fundamental law\". This principle of interpretation was further articulated by McIntyre J., for a unanimous Court, in Winnipeg School Division No. 1 v. Craton, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 150, at p. 156:\nHuman rights legislation is of a special nature and declares public policy regarding matters of general concern. It is not constitutional in nature in the sense that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed by the Legislature. It is, however, of such nature that it may not be altered, amended, or repealed, nor may exceptions be created to its provisions, save by clear legislative pronouncement.\nThe emphasis upon the \"special nature\" of human rights enactments was a strong indication of the Court's general attitude to the interpretation of such legislation.\nI think this principle of paramountcy must apply in this case to enable a Human Rights Tribunal to order a promotion which it has found has been denied for reasons of discrimination, contrary to the Act. In other words, the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission and the process respecting promotions within the Public Service must give way in those rare exceptions where promotions have been denied based on discriminatory reasons and where a Tribunal, acting within its jurisdiction under the Act, orders a promotion in order to remedy the results of discriminatory action taken by the employer. In this respect, I adopt the approach of Dickson J., as he then was, in Kelso v. Her Majesty the Queen, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 199 where he stated at page 207:\nNo one is challenging the general right of the Government to allocate resources and manpower as it sees fit. But this right is not unlimited. It must be exercised according to law. The government's right to allocate resources cannot override a statute such as the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 1976-77, c. 33, or a regulation such as the Exclusion Order.\nAs counsel for Dr. Uzoaba pointed out, it would be easy, and correct, in this case, to paraphrase Dickson J. with the words: \"No one is challenging the general right of the government to promote according to the merit principle. But this right is not unlimited. It must be exercised according to law. The government's right to promote according to merit cannot override a statute such as the Canadian Human Rights Act.\"\nAny other conclusion would, as put by Chief Justice Dickson in Action Travail des Femmes, minimize the rights contained in the Act and enfeeble their proper impact. See page 1134.\nFurther, as counsel for the Human Rights Commission pointed out, if the Act was not paramount in a case such as this, the jurisdiction of a Tribunal to order reinstatement at a higher level would apply to non-government federal positions where the Act is applicable but not to government positions. Such an anomaly could not have been envisaged by Parliament.\n(Uzoaba at paras. 17-23)\n[114] The Uzoaba decision reinforces the primacy of the Act when in conflict with other legislation, consistent with the principles enunciated in Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne. However, given that the conflict between legislation arose in the context of remedies, the Uzoaba decision does not provide guidance on whether legislation can be challenged under the Act as a \u201cservice\u201d. Rather, like Heerspink, Craton, and Larocque, the Uzoaba decision is instructive on the type of situation where other legislation may come in conflict with human rights laws.\nDissenting reasons in Bhinder and Cooper [115] The dissenting reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. (as they then were) in Bhinder, like the decision in Uzoaba, reinforce the primacy of the Act when in conflict with other legislation:\nIn the present appeal, the provisions of the Canada Labour Code and Regulations thereunder do not create an exception to the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The wearing of safety helmets by Sikhs, a requirement which has a prima facie discriminatory effect, is a matter governed by the Canadian Human Rights Act, not the Canada Labour Code, where the requirements of the two Acts conflict. Thus, even if the safety helmet policy is necessary under the Canada Labour Code and Regulations, it does not follow that the policy is ipso facto a bona fide occupational requirement for the purpose of the Canadian Human Rights Act. Accordingly, the Tribunal had jurisdiction to order the employer to grant Mr. Bhinder an exemption from the safety helmet policy on the ground the policy did not meet the requirements of s. 14(a) of the Act.\n(Bhinder at p. 575)\nHowever, the dissenting reasons do not address whether legislation can be challenged under the Act as a \u201cservice\u201d.\n[116] Similarly, the dissenting reasons of McLachlin J. and L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. (as they then were) in Cooper draw an analogy between the Tribunal\u2019s finding in Druken (that the offending enactment was implicitly repealed by the enactment of the Act) and the Commission\u2019s power to consider questions of law:\nIn this case, it is a provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act -- the \"normal age of retirement\" defence which is argued to be implicitly repealed by the Charter. However, from the point of view of the jurisdiction of the Commission there is no distinction between this case and Druken. If the appellants are correct, s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 has implicitly repealed the \u201cnormal age of retirement\u201d defence of the Canadian Human Rights Act. In order to decide whether a complaint has validity, the Commission is obliged to determine whether this submission has merit or not. Following the principle affirmed in Douglas College and applied in Re Shewchuk and Druken, the Commission has power to consider that question in discharging its duty of deciding whether to dismiss the complaint or refer it to a tribunal.\n(Cooper at para. 101)\nAgain, these dissenting reasons do not address whether legislation can be challenged under the Act as a \u201cservice\u201d.\nConclusion on other federal case law prior to Murphy [117] The Commission\u2019s assertion that federal human rights cases have recognized the Act as having primacy over other inconsistent laws is correct. However, as mentioned above with regard to the Supreme Court of Canada cases, primacy does not mean that the Act allows for complaints that challenge the wording of other laws, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act. Nor are there any comments in these cases that suggest otherwise.\n[118] The basis of the conflict between legislation in cases like Druken, Gonzalez, and McAllister-Windsor began with a complaint regarding a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d under the Act, in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d. Again, I am of the view that those cases are actually consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy, in the sense that the Federal Court of Appeal required there to be a \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, for there to be a valid complaint in that case.\n(iii) Provincial case law recognizing the primacy of human rights laws [119] According to the Commission, wherever possible, human rights statutes from across Canada should be given consistent interpretations, given their general similarities, quasi-constitutional status, and shared objectives of preventing discrimination. As a result, in considering whether the Act allows for complaints that effectively challenge the wording of federal laws, the Commission urges the Tribunal to examine case law from other jurisdictions across Canada. In this regard, the Commission submits that there is a wealth of decisions that follow the Supreme Court\u2019s guidance in cases like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne, and the Druken line of federal case law. According to the Commission, in these cases, decision-makers have accepted that (i) steps taken by government actors under mandatory terms of legislation can qualify as \u201cservices\u201d for purposes of human rights review and\/or (ii) quasi-constitutional human rights statutes can be used to render conflicting legislation inoperable.\n[120] Specifically, the Commission referred the Tribunal to the following provincial cases: Ontario (Disability Support Program) v. Tranchemontagne, 2010 ONCA 593 [Tranchemontagne (ONCA)]; Ball v. Ontario (Minister of Community and Social Services), 2010 HRTO 360 [Ball]; Hendershott v. Ontario (Community and Social Services), 2011 HRTO 482 [Hendershott]; Ivancicevic v. Ontario (Consumer Services), 2011 HRTO 1714 [Ivancicevic]; XY v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services), 2012 HRTO 726 [XY]; Gwinner v. Alberta (Human Resources and Employment), 2002 ABQB 685 [Gwinner]; Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services), 1988 CanLII 212 (SK CA) [Chambers]; Saskatchewan (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission), 1999 CanLII 12368 (SK CA) [Wiebe]; Human Rights Commission v. Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission, 2005 NLCA 61 [Nfld HRC]; Neubauer v. British Columbia (Ministry of Human Resources), 2005 BCHRT 239 [Neubauer]; and, A.A. v. New Brunswick (Department of Family and Community Services), [2004] N.B.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4 (QL) [AA].\n[121] While I agree, as analyzed above, that Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne, and the Druken line of federal case law, provide that quasi-constitutional human rights statutes can be used to render conflicting legislation inoperable; however, as also noted above, in my view, these cases do not stand for the proposition that the Act allows for complaints that effectively challenge the wording of federal laws. Rather, for there to be a valid complaint under the Act, the complainant in each case must identify a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of the Act. The provincial authorities referred to by the Commission are also consistent with this reasoning:\n\u2022 \u201cThe SBT held that the respondents were denied a service available to other disabled people\u201d (Tranchemontagne (ONCA) at para. 50);\n\u2022 \u201cI note at the outset that there is no dispute between the parties that the provision of benefits under the special diet allowance program is a \"service\" within the meaning of the Code\u2026\u201d (Ball at para. 61);\n\u2022 \u201cThere is no dispute that the provision of government benefits is a service\u201d (Hendershott at para. 69);\n\u2022 \u201cIn my view, the present Application is with respect to services within the meaning of the Code, and is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. I am satisfied that the legislation in question, concerning the regulation of licensed premises, is intended to benefit the public, and, in particular, staff and patrons of licensed premises in Ontario, including the applicant\u201d (Ivancicevic at para. 150);\n\u2022 \u201cIn these circumstances, it is clear that when the respondent provides birth certificates pursuant to the VSA, it provides something of benefit to a person or to the public, and therefore provides a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s.1 of the Code\u201d (XY at para. 87);\n\u2022 \u201cIn my opinion the financial assistance is a service offered to the public under s. 12(1) of the Code\u201d (Chambers at p. 28);\n\u2022 The finding that the payment of wage loss benefits was a service was not pursued on appeal (see Wiebe at paras. 3-4);\n\u2022 \u201cClearly, the fact that Ms. Neubauer is ineligible for appointment to the EAA Tribunal is related to potential employment. Ms. Neubauer also argued that being eligible to be considered for appointment is a service customarily available to the public. The Ministry did not make any submissions on this issue. For the purposes of this decision, I will proceed on the basis that Ms. Neubauer's Complaint could, if found justified, constitute a contravention of s. 8 of the Code\u201d (Neubauer at para. 61); and,\n\u2022 \u201cConsequently, the issues here - birth registration and adoption - must be said to fall within the meaning of \"services\" in section 5(1) of the New Brunswick Human Rights Act\u201d (AA at para. 29).\n[122] In Gwinner, while the Court identifies that the applicable section of the human rights legislation in that case requires that no person \u201cdeny anyone services customarily available to the public\u201d, the Court and the parties do not address whether there is a service in the circumstances of the case:\nSection 3(a) of the HRCMA requires that no person \u201cdeny anyone services customarily available to the public, on the basis of marital status\u201d. The question to be asked in considering whether there is a prima facie violation of s. 3(a) of the HRCMA is whether the WPA denies pension and benefits on the basis of marital status. Subsection 3(b) of the HRCMA requires that no person \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against anyone with respect to services customarily available to the public, on the basis of marital status. The question to be asked in considering whether there is a prima facie violation of s. 3(b) of the HRCMA is whether the WPA discriminates with respect to the provision of pension and benefits, on the basis of marital status.\n(Gwinner at para. 90)\n[123] As there is no analysis of the services issue in Gwinner, I do not find this case particularly persuasive or useful in the circumstances of this case.\n[124] In Nfld HRC, the complainants alleged that they were discriminated against on the basis of marital status because they were denied their respective widow's pension upon remarriage. A human rights board of inquiry found that the effect of the remedy sought by the complainants would render subsection 65.1(1) of the Workplace Health and Safety and Compensation Act invalid. Accordingly, it declined jurisdiction on the basis that the Newfoundland Human Rights Code did not create a mechanism to determine the validity of, or to strike down allegedly discriminatory provincial legislation. On appeal, the Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal was not concerned with the merits of the complaint, but with whether the board of inquiry could order a remedy which is inconsistent with a directive contained in subsection 65.1(1) of the Workplace Health and Safety and Compensation Act (Nfld HRC at para. 9). A majority of the Court of Appeal found:\nThe board of inquiry has no jurisdiction to issue a general declaration that s. 65.1(1) of the Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Act is inoperative. The board of inquiry, however, could determine that by the operation of section 5 of the Human Rights Code a provision of another statute could not operate to justify what was otherwise conduct contrary to the Human Rights Code. Such a determination would apply only to the case in which the ruling was made. A board of inquiry could then fashion a remedy as contemplated by the Human Rights Code. This might include a directive to stop the offending behaviour and refrain from committing a contravention in the future or to take other action as permitted by s. 28 of the Human Rights Code, though this would not extend to specifying by what means the offending legislation should be made compliant. I conclude that the chief adjudicator and the Trial Division judge were in error in holding that the board of inquiry had no jurisdiction to grant a remedy in this case.\n(Nfld HRC at para. 39)\n[125] As neither the board of inquiry nor the Court addressed the merits of the case, including the services issues, I also do not find this case particularly persuasive or useful in the circumstances of this case. If anything, it reinforces the primacy of human rights cases, which I accept as indicated above.\n[126] To the extent that the above cases may stand for the proposition that \u2018steps taken by government actors under mandatory terms of legislation can qualify as \u201cservices\u201d for purposes of human rights review\u2019, I would say that those findings are dependent on the circumstances of those cases. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Watkin: \u201cRegard must be had to the particular actions which are said to give rise to the alleged discrimination in order to determine if they are \u201cservices\u201d\u2026\u201d (at para. 33). Therefore, while instructive and supportive of the primacy of human rights legislation, in my view, the provincial authorities relied on by the Commission do not support the proposition that, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act, the wording of laws can be challenged under the Act; or, that the Act allows for complaints challenging government conduct that is mandatory under the wording of law. Consistent with the Supreme Court and federal case law examined above, a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the applicable provincial legislation was identified in each of the relevant provincial cases above.\n(iv) Section 2 and subsections 49(5) and 62(1) of the Act [127] The Commission also points to the wording and legislative history of several current provisions of the Act as demonstrating Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation: section 2 and subsections 49(5) and 62(1).\n[128] According to the Commission, section 2 of the Act describes the aim and purposes of the legislation in broad terms and nothing in the statement suggest that conduct prescribed by law is immune from review for compliance with these purposes. However, on the other hand, I would note that neither does section 2 explicitly provide that conduct prescribed by law can be challenged under the Act. Furthermore, the Commission\u2019s argument ignores the rest of the wording and scheme of the Act. Subsection 40(1) of the Act provides that individuals may file a complaint if they have reasonable grounds for believing that a person has engaged in a discriminatory practice. Section 39 of the Act defines a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d as any practice within the meaning of section 5 to 14.1 of the Act. There is no discriminatory practice in sections 5 to 14.1 that provides for the review of legislation for compliance with the Act.\n[129] With regard to subsection 49(5), it requires that \u201c[i]f a complaint involves a question about whether another Act or a regulation made under another Act is inconsistent with this Act or a regulation made under it\u201d, it be adjudicated by a Tribunal member who is a member of the bar of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec. According to the Commission, this demonstrates Parliament\u2019s understanding that complaints regarding inconsistencies between the Act and other federal laws may be filed and determined on their merits. However, again, the Commission\u2019s argument ignores the wording and scheme of the Act and, particularly, section 39 and subsection 40(1) of the Act. Subsection 49(5) does not alter, modify or add to the discriminatory practices set out in sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act.\n[130] If the Act does not apply to the wording of other laws then, according to the Commission, Parliament spoke in vain when it enacted subsection 49(5). The Commission argues that such an approach renders subsection 49(5) meaningless; and, there would be no purpose in defining the composition of the panel that will hear complaints challenging federal legislation, if such complaints are always outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. However, whereas the Commission interprets subsection 49(5) to indicate that legislation can be challenged under the Act, the opening words of subsection 49(5) only go so far as saying \u201c[i]f the complaint involves a question about whether another Act\u2026is inconsistent\u201d; or, in French, \u201cDans le cas o\u00fb la plainte met en cause la compatibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition d\u2019une autre loi\u2026\u201d (emphasis added). As cases such as Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Uzoaba demonstrate, there are situations outside of actually challenging legislation under the Act where other legislation may be inconsistent with the Act. As mentioned above, this jurisprudence also does not indicate that the concept of the primacy of human rights legislation, which subsection 49(5) would appear to speak to, equates to the ability to challenge legislation under the Act.\n[131] The Commission also relies upon passages from the proceedings in Parliament leading to the addition of subsection 49(5) in the Act as demonstrating the government\u2019s recognition and acceptance that the Act apply to the wording of other laws. My reading of these passages leads me to believe that the main reason for adding subsection 49(5) was to have lawyers adjudicate cases involving questions of inconsistency of legislation. The reasoning was that these types of cases may be legalistic and complex, and having a lawyer adjudicate them would assist in their expeditious resolution: \u201cI am therefore of the view that having legal representation on the tribunal would be helpful and would assist in the expeditious adjudication of some of these complex legal and evidentiary and procedural issues\u201d (Minutes of Proceedings of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, House of Commons, dated March 12, 1998, statement of Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada). This makes sense considering subsection 49(5)\u2019s placement alongside subsection 49(2) of the Act, which provides for the Chairperson of the Tribunal to assign a three member panel where the complexity of a complaint requires it. While some officials also commented on the types of cases being brought before the Tribunal, including the Tribunal\u2019s power to render legislation inoperable, those comments do not indicate that the intention of 49(5) was anything other than having lawyers sit on those types of cases. Having examined the wording of subsection 49(5), along with its placement in the scheme of the Act and Parliament\u2019s intent in adding it, in my view, subsection 49(5) does not support the Commission\u2019s argument that the Act allows for complaints that challenge the wording of other laws.\n[132] The Commission also points to subsection 62(1) of the Act to support its case. This subsection provides a statutory exception from Parts I and II of the Act for any superannuation, pension fund or plan established by an Act of Parliament enacted before March 1, 1978. According to the Commission, without this exemption, the Act would have applied to and affected any discriminatory provisions in the federal pension or superannuation legislation. However, again, the Commission\u2019s argument ignores the wording and scheme of the Act and, particularly, section 39 and subsection 40(1) of the Act. Subsection 62(1) does not alter, modify or add to the discriminatory practices set out in sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act.\n[133] Again, the Commission also argues that, if the Act does not apply to the wording of other laws, then Parliament spoke in vain when enacting subsection 62(1) and the provision is effectively rendered meaningless. However, that argument again confuses the concept of the primacy of human rights legislation with the ability to challenge legislation, as a discriminatory practice, under the Act. As analyzed above, there is no indication in the case law that the primacy of human rights legislation equates to the ability to challenge legislation under the Act.\n[134] In the same vein, the March 10, 1977 statement of the then Minister of Justice regarding the inclusion of subsection 62(1) in the Act, relied upon by the Commission, does not indicate that the Act apply to the wording of other laws, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act. The Minister\u2019s comments indicate to me that the inclusion of 62(1) was precautionary, to guard against the possibility that the Act could render aspects of government pension plans inoperable: \u201cModifications to some of these plans may be required to ensure consistency with Bill C-25\u201d (Statement by Minister of Justice to Justice and Legal Affairs Committee, House of Commons, March 10, 1977, emphasis added). In this regard, I agree with the Commission\u2019s explanation of the implications of this passage:\nThe implications of this passage is that without the statutory exemption, complaints under the CHRA could have led to hasty modifications to the terms of legislated pension plans. In the circumstances, Parliament took specific steps to ensure that it would retain the ability to make the desired modifications at its own pace.\n(Written Submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission for use at Stage 1 of the Tribunal Hearing (to be held January 30 to Feb. 1, 2013), January 11, 2013, at para. 74, emphasis added)\n[135] Therefore, pursuant to the analysis above, in my view, section 2 and subsections 49(5) and 62(1) of the Act do not demonstrate Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act.\n(v) The former section 67 of the Act [136] According to the Complainants, the intent and purpose behind the repeal of section 67 was to open up the whole of the Indian Act to full scrutiny under the Act. Similarly, the Commission claims that the former section 67 functioned as a statutory exception to the general principle that human rights laws have primacy. The existence of section 67 implied that, without the exemption, the Act would have applied to and affected any discriminatory provisions in the Indian Act. In fact, the Commission submits that Parliament enacted the former section 67 for the purpose of shielding the registration provisions of the Indian Act from review under the Act. Therefore, in repealing section 67 in 2008, Parliament intended to open the door to human rights complaints challenging discriminatory aspects of those same provisions.\n[137] The former section 67 of the Act provided:\nNothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\n[138] Similar to the exemption at subsection 62(1), I agree that the former section 67 of the Act functioned as a statutory exception to the possibility of the Act having primacy over the Indian Act and, therefore, rendering some of its provisions inoperable. As the Commission aptly explained in its submissions:\nIn this regard, the record shows that at the time in 1977 that Parliament was considering the legislation that would eventually become the CHRA, a commitment had been made not to amend the Indian Act without consulting with Indian peoples. As a result, the Minister of Indian Affairs requested that an exemption be written into the CHRA that would exempt the Indian Act from human rights review. The government agreed and included clause 63(2) (the section that would eventually become s. 67), with the stated intent of ensuring that \u201c\u2026the Indian Act will not, in effect, be modified by this Act\u201d while consultations with Indian representatives are continuing.\n(Written Submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission for use at Stage 1 of the Tribunal Hearing (to be held January 30 to Feb. 1, 2013), January 11, 2013, at para. 80)\n[139] However, as analyzed above, the primacy of human rights legislation does not mean that the wording of other laws can be challenged under the Act, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act. In this regard, the Complainants and Commission\u2019s argument again ignores the wording and scheme of the Act and, particularly, section 39 and subsection 40(1) of the Act. The inclusion of the former section 67 in the Act, did not alter, modify or add to the discriminatory practices set out in sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act.\n[140] The Commission goes further and claims that section 67 was specifically included because the government felt that the registration provisions in the Indian Act violated the Act. According to the Commission, once it is accepted that Parliament enacted section 67 for the purpose of shielding the registration provisions of the Indian Act from review under the Act, it must also be accepted that in repealing section 67, Parliament intended to open the door to human rights complaints challenging discriminatory aspects of those same provisions.\n[141] Similar to the inclusion of section 67 in the former Act, the repeal of the section also did not alter, modify or add to the discriminatory practices set out in sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act. While the repeal of the section no longer exempts the provisions of the Indian Act, or any provision made under or pursuant to the Indian Act, from potential conflict with the Act; however, as analyzed above, that conflict must arise pursuant to a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of the Act. I would add that, aside from the Commission\u2019s focus on the registration provisions of the Indian Act, the repeal of section 67 more broadly allows for complaints challenging actions and decisions made pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Act, whether by the government or First Nations organizations.\n[142] Therefore, in my view, the repeal of section 67 of the Act also does not demonstrate Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act.\n(vi) Conclusion: the complaint is dismissed [143] Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontage support the Complainants and Commission\u2019s claim that human rights legislation has primacy over other inconsistent laws and, consequently, can render legislation that is in conflict with it inoperable. This is also consistent with federal human rights cases such as Druken, Gonzalez, McAllister-Windsor and Uzoaba, and other provincial human rights cases, that have used human rights legislation to render inconsistent legislation inoperable. However, while these cases support the primacy of human rights legislation and its ability to render legislation inoperable, there is no indication in these cases that the Act allows for complaints that challenge the wording of other laws.\n[144] The basis of the conflict between legislation in Heerspink, Craton and Larocque, and the federal and provincial cases relied upon by the Complainants and Commission, were couched in \u201cdiscrimination\u201d complaints under the applicable human rights legislation in those cases. The complaints themselves were not challenges to the wording of other laws. A \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d, within the meaning of the applicable legislation, was present.\n[145] In this regard, subsection 40(1) of the Act provides that individuals may file a complaint if they have reasonable grounds for believing that a person has engaged in a discriminatory practice. Section 39 of the Act defines a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d as any practice within the meaning of section 5 to 14.1 of the Act. There is no discriminatory practice in sections 5 to 14.1 that provides for the review of legislation for compliance with the Act.\n[146] While the Commission pointed to section 2 and subsections 49(5) and 62(1) of the Act as demonstrating Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation, those sections do not alter, modify or add to the discriminatory practices set out in sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act. While subsections 49(5) and 62(1) may speak to the primacy of the Act when in conflict with other federal legislation, again, the primacy of human rights legislation does not mean that there is an ability to challenge legislation under the Act, absent a discriminatory practice.\n[147] Similarly, the inclusion and repeal of the former section 67 of the Act did not alter, modify or add to the discriminatory practices set out in sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act. In the same vein as subsection 62(1), the former section 67 of the Act functioned as a statutory exception to the possibility of the Act having primacy over the Indian Act and, therefore, rendering some of its provisions inoperable. However, again, the primacy of human rights legislation does not mean that the wording of other laws can be challenged under the Act, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act.\n[148] On the basis of the above reasoning, I do not find that Murphy is superseded by binding case law from the Supreme Court of Canada. Nor do I find authority to support the proposition that the Act allows for complaints challenging the discriminatory impact of other federal laws, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act. In my view, Heerspink, Craton and Larocque, and the federal and provincial cases relied upon by the Complainants and Commission, are actually consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy. Similar to the analysis in those cases, the Federal Court of Appeal required there to be a \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction. Also, the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s comments in Murphy do not put in question the primacy of the Act when in conflict with other legislation.\n[149] However, Murphy does clarify that a challenge to legislation, and nothing else, is not a service and, therefore, is not a discriminatory practice within the meaning or jurisdiction of the Act. Leading to Murphy, through cases like Forward and Watkin, the judicial understanding of the term \u201cservices\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, has been clarified, consistent with the proper interpretive attitude toward human rights legislation espoused in Heerspink, Craton, Action Travail des Femmes and Tranchemontagne (see Watkin at para. 34). As mentioned above, neither the Complainants nor the Commission took issue with the general criteria currently used to determine whether conduct is with respect to a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the Act.\n[150] Having found the current complaint to be a challenge to legislation, and nothing else; that Murphy is not superseded by binding case law from the Supreme Court of Canada; and, that the Act does not allow for complaints challenging the discriminatory impact of other federal laws, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act; therefore, as the Complainant\u2019s have not identified a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, this complaint is dismissed.\nC. Does the complaint impugn a discriminatory practice in the provision of services customarily available to the general public that could be the subject of a finding of prima facie discrimination under section 5 of the Act? [151] Pursuant to the conclusion above, this last question is answered in the negative.\n[152] Given that the Complainants are attempting to counter the application of legislation, a constitutional challenge would be the most appropriate avenue to seek the result desired by the Complainants, especially given the Complainants\u2019 claim that there is a significant public interest in their cause. As described in Andrews above, the difference between a challenge under the Charter and a complaint under the Act are distinct:\nThe Court in the case at bar must address the issue of discrimination as the term is used in s. 15(1) of the Charter. In general, it may be said that the principles which have been applied under the Human Rights Acts are equally applicable in considering questions of discrimination under s. 15(1). Certain differences arising from the difference between the Charter and the Human Rights Acts must, however, be considered. To begin with, discrimination in s. 15(1) is limited to discrimination caused by the application or operation of law, whereas the Human Rights Acts apply also to private activities.\n[\u2026]\nWhere discrimination is forbidden in the Human Rights Acts it is done in absolute terms, and where a defence or exception is allowed it, too, speaks in absolute terms and the discrimination is excused. There is, in this sense, no middle ground. In the Charter, however, while s. 15(1), subject always to subs. (2), expresses its prohibition of discrimination in absolute terms, s. 1 makes allowance for a reasonable limit upon the operation of s. 15(1). A different approach under s. 15(1) is therefore required. While discrimination under s. 15(1) will be of the same nature and in descriptive terms will fit the concept of discrimination developed under the Human Rights Acts, a further step will be required in order to decide whether discriminatory laws can be justified under s. 1. The onus will be on the state to establish this. This is a distinct step called for under the Charter which is not found in most Human Rights Acts, because in those Acts justification for or defence to discrimination is generally found in specific exceptions to the substantive rights.\n(Andrews at pp. 175, 176)\n[153] If the Complainants had established a prima facie case under section 5 of the Act, then paragraph 15(1)(g) of the Act would have provided the Respondent with the opportunity to demonstrate a bona fide justification for its actions. To be considered a bona fide justification, subsection 15(2) of the Act provides that the Respondent must establish that accommodating the needs of individuals like the Complainants would impose undue hardship considering health, safety and cost. However, as a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada explained in Hutterian Brethren, the duty to accommodate analysis is not appropriate where the validity of a law is at stake:\nIn my view, a distinction must be maintained between the reasonable accommodation analysis undertaken when applying human rights laws, and the s. 1 justification analysis that applies to a claim that a law infringes the Charter. Where the validity of a law is at stake, the appropriate approach is a s. 1 Oakes analysis. Under this analysis, the issue at the stage of minimum impairment is whether the goal of the measure could be accomplished in a less infringing manner. The balancing of effects takes place at the third and final stage of the proportionality test. If the government establishes justification under the Oakes test, the law is constitutional. If not, the law is null and void under s. 52 insofar as it is inconsistent with the Charter.\nA different analysis applies where a government action or administrative practice is alleged to violate the claimant\u2019s Charter rights. If a Charter violation is found, the court\u2019s remedial jurisdiction lies not under s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982 but under s. 24(1) of the Charter: R. v. Ferguson, 2008 SCC 6, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 96, at para. 61. In such cases, the jurisprudence on the duty to accommodate, which applies to governments and private parties alike, may be helpful \u201cto explain the burden resulting from the minimal impairment test with respect to a particular individual\u201d (emphasis added): Multani, at para. 53, per Charron J.\nMinimal impairment and reasonable accommodation are conceptually distinct. Reasonable accommodation is a concept drawn from human rights statutes and jurisprudence. It envisions a dynamic process whereby the parties \u2014 most commonly an employer and employee \u2014 adjust the terms of their relationship in conformity with the requirements of human rights legislation, up to the point at which accommodation would mean undue hardship for the accommodating party. In Multani, Deschamps and Abella JJ. explained:\nThe process required by the duty of reasonable accommodation takes into account the specific details of the circumstances of the parties and allows for dialogue between them. This dialogue enables them to reconcile their positions and find common ground tailored to their own needs. [para. 131]\nA very different kind of relationship exists between a legislature and the people subject to its laws. By their very nature, laws of general application are not tailored to the unique needs of individual claimants. The legislature has no capacity or legal obligation to engage in such an individualized determination, and in many cases would have no advance notice of a law\u2019s potential to infringe Charter rights. It cannot be expected to tailor a law to every possible future contingency, or every sincerely held religious belief. Laws of general application affect the general public, not just the claimants before the court. The broader societal context in which the law operates must inform the s. 1 justification analysis. A law\u2019s constitutionality under s. 1 of the Charter is determined, not by whether it is responsive to the unique needs of every individual claimant, but rather by whether its infringement of Charter rights is directed at an important objective and is proportionate in its overall impact. While the law\u2019s impact on the individual claimants is undoubtedly a significant factor for the court to consider in determining whether the infringement is justified, the court\u2019s ultimate perspective is societal. The question the court must answer is whether the Charter infringement is justifiable in a free and democratic society, not whether a more advantageous arrangement for a particular claimant could be envisioned.\nSimilarly, \u201cundue hardship\u201d, a pivotal concept in reasonable accommodation, is not easily applicable to a legislature enacting laws. In the human rights context, hardship is seen as undue if it would threaten the viability of the enterprise which is being asked to accommodate the right. The degree of hardship is often capable of expression in monetary terms. By contrast, it is difficult to apply the concept of undue hardship to the cost of achieving or not achieving a legislative objective, especially when the objective is (as here) preventative or precautionary. Though it is possible to interpret \u201cundue hardship\u201d broadly as encompassing the hardship that comes with failing to achieve a pressing government objective, this attenuates the concept. Rather than strain to adapt \u201cundue hardship\u201d to the context of s. 1 of the Charter, it is better to speak in terms of minimal impairment and proportionality of effects.\nIn summary, where the validity of a law of general application is at stake, reasonable accommodation is not an appropriate substitute for a proper s. 1 analysis based on the methodology of Oakes. Where the government has passed a measure into law, the provisions of s. 1 apply. The government is entitled to justify the law, not by showing that it has accommodated the claimant, but by establishing that the measure is rationally connected to a pressing and substantial goal, minimally impairing of the right and proportionate in its effects.\n(Hutterian Brethren at paras. 66-71)\n[154] Therefore, aside from the determination that legislation is not a service within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, the comments of the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada would also suggest that the scheme and analytical framework of the Act is not an appropriate method by which to analyze the alleged discriminatory aspects of section 6 of the Indian Act. The government is entitled to justify section 6 of the Indian Act, not by showing a bona fide justification pursuant to subsection 15(2) of the Act, but by establishing that any infringement on the rights of the Complainants is justifiable in a free and democratic society pursuant to section 1 of the Charter.\n[155] For all these reasons, the complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Background [1] On January 30, 2005, the Complainant, Janet Gover, filed a complaint against the respondent, the Canada Border Services Agency, in which she refers to allegations of violations of sections 7, 10 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] At the beginning of her complaint, the Complainant stated the following:\nI have reasonable grounds for believing that I have been discriminated against and my Employer has failed to accommodate my disability. I have reasonable grounds to believe that I have been subjected to systemic prejudice, Discrimination and Harassment. Therefore, I am noting (but not limited to) a reference to allegations of violations under Section 07 (seven) Section 10 (Ten) and Section 14 (Fourteen) of the Canadian Human Right Act.\n[3] For a better understanding of this case, I refer to the provisions cited above with respect to the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, which read as follows:\nSection 7: It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 10: It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 14: (1) It is a discriminatory practice,\n(a) in the provision of good, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public,\n(b) in the provision of commercial premises or residential accommodation, or\n(c) in matters related to employment,\nto harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nMarginal note: Sexual harassment\n(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), sexual harassment shall, for the purposes of that subsection, be deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n1980-81-82-83, c. 143, s. 7.\nSection 14.1: It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n1998, c. 9, s. 14.\n[4] Before I proceed to the inquiry and hearing of the Complainant\u2019s case, the Respondent has filed a motion that appears in the style of cause of this judgment, asking the Tribunal to make an order confirming the scope of the complaint filed by the Complainant.\n[5] Specifically, the Respondent is asking the Tribunal to limit the hearing of the Complainant\u2019s complaint to the telephone aspect that was referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, to the exclusion of the questions about the wage\/salary issue.\n[6] Accordingly, this motion was filed for the avowed purpose of obtaining clarification of the mandate entrusted to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission under sections 44(3)(a) and 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nII. The Motion A. Respondent\u2019s motion [7] In the motion that the Respondent filed with the Tribunal, the Respondent states that the Complainant\u2019s original complaint raised two points before the Canadian Human Rights Commission:\n(a) Wage\/salary issue;\n(b) Telephone;\n[8] According to the Respondent, the Commission investigated two aspects of the Complainant\u2019s complaint but referred only the telephone issue to the Tribunal, based on an investigation report that appears in Schedule A, paragraph 14, Affidavit of C. Deborah Hagarty, Tab B.\n[9] In the Respondent\u2019s view, again based on the above\u2011noted Commission\u2019s investigation report, the Respondent indicates the following at paragraph 10 of its submissions on this motion:\nOn the basis of those conclusions, the investigation report made the following recommendations:\nIt is recommended, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, that the Commission request that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute and inquire into the complaint because:\n\u2022 the evidence suggests that the Respondent adversely affected the complainant by denying her a telephone at her workstation.\n\u2022 having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry by a Tribunal is warranted.\n[10] Subsequently, the Respondent states the following at paragraph 12 of its submissions:\nThe investigation report was reviewed by the Commission along with submissions filed by the parties in response to the report. The Commission issued its referral decision by letter of May 3, 2012.\n[11] Also, the Respondent refers to the Commission\u2019s decision letter, which uses the same wording as the Commission\u2019s investigation report, and refers the parties to the Commission\u2019s decision letter, Hagarty Affidavit, Tab A, which is a letter from the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Complainant, Janet Gover, which reads as follows: (The following emphasis is the Tribunal\u2019s.)\nDear Ms. Gover:\nI am writing to inform you of the decision taken by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in your complaint (20041101) against Canada Border Services Agency.\nBefore rendering the decision, the Commission reviewed the report disclosed to you previously and any submission(s) filed in response to the report. After examining this information, the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint because:\nThe evidence suggests that the Respondent adversely affected the complainant by denying her a telephone at her workstation; and\nHaving regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry by a Tribunal is warranted.\nFurther information will be provided to you by the Tribunal regarding the conduct of proceedings.\n[12] In its principal argument, the Respondent asks the following question:\nIs the scope of the referral to the Tribunal limited to the complaint about the telephone issue?\n[13] In its subsequent argument, the Respondent bases its motion on the following point:\nThe Commission did not refer to the wage\/salary issue in its decision and, in addition, it stated that the investigation report would be considered as reflecting the Commission\u2019s reasoning. In that, the Respondent referred to Sketchley v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 404, at para. 37. Reference: Page 7, para. 22 of the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n[14] Second, the Respondent states that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence recognizes that it is possible to refer a portion of a complaint, citing the decisions in Powell v. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., 2006 CHRT 27, Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22 and C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Attorney General of Canada, 2003 CHRT 32.\n[15] Overall, the Respondent states that only the telephone issue was referred to the Tribunal since the Commission did not explicitly also mention a reference to the wage\/salary issue, and I quote: Reference: Page 10, paragraphs 33 and 34 of the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n33. As the wage\/salary issue was not referred by the Commission, it is not before the Tribunal for inquiry. It is therefore outside of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. If the Tribunal were to allow the wage\/salary issue to proceed to hearing regardless, it would render meaningless the Commission\u2019s screening function under the Act.\n34. The Act does not provide complainants with direct access to the Tribunal. The Commission, an administrative agency, is charged with deciding whether complaints should be dealt with, investigated and\/or referred to Tribunal. The Tribunal can only adjudicate complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission.\n[16] Lastly, the Respondent states in its final argument that the Tribunal must ensure that complaints entrusted to it are dealt with expeditiously, taking into account the interpretation of the letter from the Commission as indicated above, and that only the telephone issue was entrusted to the Tribunal for inquiry, not the wage\/salary issue. The Respondent states that if the Respondent\u2019s motion is granted, that would greatly facilitate the expeditious conduct of the proceedings instituted in this case.\nB. Complainant\u2019s Reply [17] In response to the argument filed by the Respondent in support of its motion, the Complainant states that the failure to explicitly mention a part of the complaint as in this case demonstrates the Commission\u2019s intention to refer the Complainant\u2019s entire complaint. She therefore adopts a position a contrario to the Respondent\u2019s argument in its motion.\n[18] She also refers to the fact that the Respondent misconstrued the Commission\u2019s investigation report and states that the Commission clearly indicated that it had fully considered all the arguments that had been filed including \u201cboth the investigation report and the post\u2011investigation submissions of the parties\u201d.\n[19] In her view, the interpretation of the jurisprudence from the Federal Court indicates that the Commission must use clear language and reasons to reject \u201cpost-investigation submissions, particularly where those submissions allege omissions.\u201d\n[20] Like the Respondent, the Complainant refers to the letter of May 3, 2012, addressed to the Complainant, Janet Gover. It should be noted that the Complainant had previously filed an application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision with the Federal Court; the Complainant subsequently abandoned this application for judicial review. (The emphasis above is the Tribunal\u2019s.)\n[21] In her conclusion, the Complainant states the following:\n50. The Commission in this instance chose to refer the complaint to the Tribunal using broad, general language which encompasses all portions of the complaint. The Respondent relies on the lack of an express referral to assert that the wage\/salary issue has been dismissed. However, this is not consistent with the importance of the rights in issue, the role of the Commission, or the statutory scheme setting out the Commission\u2019s powers to refer and dismiss. These factors indicate that the Commission\u2019s exercise of its discretion and power to dismiss must be done through clear and explicit language. Here, the lack of express language dismissing any part of the complaint and the generality of the referral demonstrate the Commission\u2019s intention to refer the full complaint. Had the Commission intended to dismiss the wage\/salary issue, it would have done so explicitly, as is consistent with its own practice.\n51. Moreover, the Commission has indicated that it gave consideration to the post-investigation submissions of the parties. The Commission at no time indicated that it was rejecting any of these submissions, and so it can be assumed that they inform the Commission\u2019s assessment of whether an inquiry is warranted. The Respondent\u2019s position relies entirely on the investigator\u2019s report to interpret the Commission\u2019s referral. The investigator\u2019s report is of limited interpretive value where the Commission took other submissions under consideration.\n52. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s motion should be dismissed in its entirety.\nC. Position of the Canadian Human Rights Commission [22] In response to the Respondent\u2019s motion, the Canadian Human Rights Commission opposes the Respondent\u2019s motion and asks that it be dismissed for the following reasons.\n[23] In its argument, the Commission refers to two letters issued by the Commission on the same day, May 3, 2012, i.e. a letter addressed to the Complainant herself, with the following notation:\nthe evidence suggests that the Respondent adversely effected the complainant by denying her a telephone at her workstation: and\nhaving regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry by the Tribunal is warranted (emphasis added).\n[24] The Commission also refers to a second letter dated May 3, 2012, addressed directly to the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal in the following terms: (emphasis added)\nOn May 3, 2012, the Commission referred Ms. Gover\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry. The Acting Chief Commissioner\u2019s letter to the Chairperson of the Tribunal in instructive. It stated:\nThe Canadian Human Rights Commission has reviewed the complaint (20041101) of Janet Gover against Canada Border Services Agency.\nThe Commission has decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the complaint as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\nA copy of the complaint form is enclosed. . . .\nSaikali affidavit, Commission\u2019s Motion Record, Tab 2, Exhibit \u201cD\u201d\n[25] The Commission reiterates unequivocally that it referred to the Tribunal \u201cthe entire complaint of Ms. Gover has been referred to the Tribunal for further inquiry, not just a portion of it as there is no indication in the Commission\u2019s decision and referral letters that only \u2018the telephone issue\u2019 has been referred for inquiry.\u201d Reference: Page 5, para 11 Submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[26] In its argument, the Commission refers to Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22, and Lacroix v, RCMP, 2009 CHRT 35, Respondent\u2019s Motion Record, TABS F and G.\n[27] The Commission drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the fact that it considers the Respondent\u2019s argument to be, in fact, a request to the Tribunal to review the process whereby the Commission refers a complaint to the Tribunal, which the Federal Court explicitly excluded from the Tribunal\u2019s powers in Canadian Human Rights v. Lemire and al, 2012 FC 1162, paras 52-58, Commission\u2019s Motion Record, Tab 5.\n[28] It states as follows: (page 7 Submission of the Canadian Human Rights Commission)\n15. We submit that what the Respondent is requesting here amounts to a review of the Commission\u2019s decision-making process and its handling of the complaint. This is merely a collateral attack of the Commission\u2019s administration of the complaint and its decisions.\n16. By doing so, the Respondent fails to consider the separate roles of the Commission and the Tribunal under the CHRA. The Supreme Court of Canada recently reconfirmed in Halifax the different functions and roles of the Commission as an administrative body and the Tribunal as an adjudicative body. As such, the Tribunal has no authority over the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion to refer a complaint for further inquiry pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the CHRA.\nHalifax (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), 2012 SCC 10, para 50, Commission\u2019s Motion Record, Tab 7.\n17. Very recently, the Federal Court confirmed that the role of the Tribunal is to adjudicate complaints and not collaterally review the Commission\u2019s decision making process. The Federal Court\u2019s reasoning in Lemire is instructive. In upholding a judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s decision. Justice Mosley held:\n[55] The CHRA establishes two distinct institutions, each of which has a particular role as described by the statute. It sets out a complete mechanism for dealing with human rights complaints. Central to this mechanism is the Commission. Under the scheme of the Act, the Commission is the body empowered to accept, manage and process complaints of discriminatory practices. The Tribunal has no statutory mandate under the Act with respect to its administration, except as set out in s 50 which provides that \u201cit shall inquire into the complaint\u201d when a request is made by the Commission that it do so. These factors suggest that the legislature did not intend that the Tribunal would have the authority to find the Act inoperative based on the manner in which the statute was administered.\n[56] In particular, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion under CHRA\u2019s 44(3) (rejecting of referring a complaint) and s 47 (appointing a conciliator). The proper way to challenge a Commission decision in respect of such matters is through juridical review by the Federal Court.\n[57] In exercising its authority, the Tribunal cannot collaterally question a Commission decision that is within the statutory authority of that body. This is properly left to judicial review:\n[58] The concern that the Commission referred this complaint to the Tribunal even though most of the impugned material had been moved from the Internet is, in effect a comment on the Commission\u2019s decision to request that the Tribunal hold an inquiry. That is outside the tribunal\u2019s mandate. (emphasis added)\nLemire, supra, paras 55-58.\n[29] Lastly the Commission also referred to C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2003 CHRT 32, para. 12, Commission\u2019s Motion Record, Tab 6, which is a decision of Member Hadjis of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n[30] In conclusion, the Commission states the following:\n23. Essentially, we respectfully submit that there is nothing in the Commission\u2019s decision which suggests that only the \u2018telephone issue\u2019 is referred to the Tribunal for inquiry as asserted by the Respondent. The Respondent relies on irrelevant considerations, including comments made by the Commission\u2019s investigators which are not binding on the Tribunal. The proceedings before the Tribunal are de novo. As such, the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to inquire into the entire complaint of Ms. Gover and not only portions.\nIII. Decision [31] After thoroughly reviewing the written arguments of the parties and consulting the relevant jurisprudence cited by the parties, the Tribunal concludes that the motion filed by the Respondent in this case should not be granted.\n[32] In this regard, the Tribunal finds that the main point that should be considered in adjudicating the Respondent\u2019s motion is the letter from the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Chairperson of the Tribunal, Ms. Shirish P. Chotalia, Chairperson, Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, dated May 3, 2012, which it is very useful to refer to.\nDear Ms. Chotalia:\nI am writing to inform you that the Canadian Human Rights Commission has reviewed the complaint (20041101) of Janet Gover against Canada Border Services Agency.\nThe Commission has decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the complaint as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted. (emphasis added)\nA copy or the compliant form is enclosed. Form I, including complainant and Respondent information, will be provided by the Litigation Services Division.\nThe complainant and Respondent are being advised that they will receive further information from the Tribunal regarding the proceedings.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Langtry\n[33] A review of this letter indicates, in the second paragraph, that the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that the Tribunal institute an inquiry \u201cinto the complaint, as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\n[34] Also, in the same letter, a copy of the complaint was enclosed.\n[35] Curiously, no mention of this letter addressed directly to the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal appears in the Respondent\u2019s argument in support of its motion to limit the scope of the complaint that was referred to the Tribunal.\n[36] A review of the documents appended to the Respondent\u2019s motion shows a letter also dated May 3, 2012, but addressed to the Complainant in very similar terms to the letter addressed to the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n[37] The above-mentioned nuance appears vital to the survival of the Respondent\u2019s motion.\n[38] In fact, it is clear that only the letter from the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal conferred legal jurisdiction for the purpose of granting the Tribunal all the powers that the Act gives to the Tribunal under sections 44(3)(a) and 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. (The emphasis below is the Tribunal\u2019s.)\n44. (3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission:\n(a) may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry under section 49 into the complaint to which the report relates if the Commission is satisfied\n(i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is warranted, and\n(ii) that the complaint to which the report relates should not be referred pursuant to subsection (2) or dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e);\n49. (1) At any stage after the filing of a complaint, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n(2) On receipt of a request, the Chairperson shall institute an inquiry by assigning a member of the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint, but the Chairperson may assign a panel of three members if he or she considers that the complexity of the complaint requires the inquiry to be conducted by three members.\n(3) If a panel of three members has been assigned to inquire into the complaint, the Chairperson shall designate one of them to chair the inquiry, but the Chairperson shall chair the inquiry if he or she is a member of the panel.\n(4) The Chairperson shall make a copy of the rules of procedure available to each party to the complaint.\n(5) If the complaint involves a question about whether another Act or a regulation made under another Act is inconsistent with this Act or a regulation made under it, the member assigned to inquire into the complaint or, if three members have been assigned, the member chairing the inquiry, must be a member of the bar of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec.\n(6) If a question as described in subsection (5) arises after a member or panel has been assigned and the requirements of that subsection are not met, the inquiry shall nevertheless proceed with the member or panel as designated.\n[39] Indeed, no other document appears to be as useful and necessary for conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal in order to proceed with an inquiry that is entrusted to it by the Canadian Human Rights Commission as the letter addressed directly to the Chairperson of the Tribunal and no one else.\n[40] Specifically, the Tribunal relies on a recent decision in the case Premakumar Kanagasabapathy v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Air Canada, 2013 CHRT 7, a decision written by Sophie Marchildon, Administrative Judge at the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n[41] In that decision, Administrative Judge Marchildon had to address the same issues as this case does.\n[42] Regarding the issue of the determinative nature of the letter addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal, she stated the following at paragraph 29 of her decision:\n[29] In my view, given the working of s. 49(1), the \u2018best evidence\u2019 of the Commission\u2019s request to the Chairperson for an inquiry is this: the Letter sent from the Commission to the Chairperson requesting an inquiry. In the present case, the letter of request was signed by the Acting Chief Commissioner, but most importantly, it is addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal. This is the document which initiates the entire Tribunal inquiry process. Accordingly, this is the document that determines whether the complaint has been referred in its entirety or not.\n[43] Similarly, Administrative Judge Marchildon also refers to various decisions including C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Attorney General of Canada, 2003 CHRT 32 and Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22, which also dealt with issues that are similar to those in this case.\n[44] In Kowalski, Member Hadjis stated the following with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to institute inquiries under section 49 of the Act:\n[7] The tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct inquiries into complaints is derived from s. 49 of the Act, pursuant to which the Tribunal Chairperson must institute an inquiry into a complaint upon receipt of a request from the Commission (s.49(2)). The scope of Tribunal inquiries is thus limited to the matters arising from the complaint accompanying such requests. (emphasis added)\n[8] Did the Commission refer Mr. Kowalski\u2019s entire complaint to the Tribunal in the present case? The Commission gave no indication in its letter to the Tribunal Chairperson that it had decided to limit the complaint\u2019s scope. This would suggest, therefore, that the Commission referred the entire complaint, as drafted by Mr. Kowalski on April 20, 2007, to the Tribunal.\n[45] In the Kowalski decision, Member Hadjis also referred to C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. Attorney General of Canada, 2003 CHRT 32, where the letter from the Commission to the Chairperson of the Tribunal gave no indication to suggest that only some parts of the complaint had been referred. Consequently, Member Hadjis found that the entire complaint was before the Tribunal.\n[46] By way of distinguishing this case from Kowalski, it is useful to note that in this case, just as in C\u00f4t\u00e9, there is no explicit decision by the Commission to not deal with certain allegations in the Complainant\u2019s complaint.\n[47] Furthermore, with respect to the argument that the reasons in support of the decision by the Human Rights Commission should be considered, I find that it is unnecessary to address the considerations supporting the investigation reports that are in the Complainant\u2019s record because, in doing so, the Tribunal would be in the position of reviewing the Commission\u2019s reasons, which is not within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, as the Federal Court decided in the Lemire decision (Warmen v. Lemire, 2012 F.C.J. 1233, para. 56-58).\n[48] Therefore, considering the wording of the letter dated May 3, 2012, addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal at the time, Shirish P. Chotalia, which makes no distinction with respect to portions of the complaint or rejecting those portions, I find that the entire complaint was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry and hearing, including the wage\/salary issue.\n[49] Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 24, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1822\/5212\nStyle of Cause: Janet Gover v.

Complaint [1] On October 7, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Todd Chaudhary (the Complainant) against Smoother Movers (the Respondent).\n[2] Under sections 7 and 14 of the Act, the Complainant alleges he was discriminated against and harassed, during the course of his employment with the Respondent, on the basis of his race, national or ethnic origin, colour and sex.\n[3] The Tribunal held a hearing in this matter from July 10 to 12, 2012, in Vancouver, British Columbia.\nII. Background [4] The Complainant had originally filed his complaint with the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal (the BC Tribunal) on February 6, 2008.\n[5] At the beginning of the BC Tribunal hearing, held on March 10, 2009, the Respondent argued the BC Tribunal was without jurisdiction to deal with the complaint. In an affidavit, Doug Bensley, doing business as Smoother Movers, swore: \u201c...that his business...on a regular and continuous basis, historically and currently, does about 30% of its business \u2013 pick-ups and deliveries \u2013 in other provinces of Canada and in the United States\u201d (Chaudhary v. Smoother Movers, 2009 BCHRT 111, at para. 2 [Chaudhary]).\n[6] The BC Tribunal accepted that Smoother Movers is regularly and continuously engaged in extra-provincial shipping, which falls within Federal jurisdiction, and found that the complaint was not within its jurisdiction (see Chaudhary at paras. 8-9).\n[7] Subsequently, the Complainant filed the current complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission on June 23, 2009.\nIII. Motions to Dismiss [8] The Respondent has filed two motions to dismiss the complaint. The first Notice of Motion, dated March 22, 2012, is to dismiss the complaint because of delay in getting to a hearing. The second Notice of Motion, dated April 24, 2013, is to dismiss the complaint because of delay in rendering a decision.\n[9] The Tribunal must ensure that parties appearing before it have a full and ample opportunity to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations (see subsection 50(1) of the Act). In this regard, delay may impair a party\u2019s opportunity to present its case:\nWhere delay impairs a party\u2019s ability to answer the complaint against him or her, because, for example, memories have faded, essential witnesses have died or are unavailable, or evidence has been lost, then administrative delay may be invoked to impugn the validity of the administrative proceedings and provide a remedy [...] It is thus accepted that the principles of natural justice and the duty of fairness include the right to a fair hearing and that undue delay in the processing of an administrative proceeding that impairs the fairness of the hearing can be remedied...\n(Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, at para. 102 [Blencoe])\n[10] However, \u201cdelay, without more, will not warrant a stay of proceedings as an abuse of process at common law\u201d (Blencoe at para. 101). According to a majority of the Supreme Court, \u201cthere must be proof of significant prejudice which results from an unacceptable delay\u201d (Blencoe at para. 101; see also Grover v. National Research Council of Canada, 2009 CHRT 1, at paras. 40-43; and, Grover v. Canada (Attorney General), 2010 FC 320, at paras. 29-30).\nA. Motion dated March 22, 2012 [11] The first motion to dismiss was heard as part of the hearing from July 10-12, 2012.\n[12] The Respondent\u2019s motion is based upon the time that has elapsed between the dates of the alleged incidents giving rise to the complaint and the date of the hearing before the Tribunal, which is over four years. According to the Respondent, this delay is unreasonable and has caused it prejudice in providing a full answer and defence to the complaint. Specifically, the Respondent claims witnesses are no longer available or no longer have a clear recollection of the events and evidentiary issues in this case.\n[13] The Respondent identified two witnesses who were unable to attend the hearing. The Respondent submits that the evidence of these two witnesses would have been important to its case. The first potential witness, Jason Pilay, whom the Respondent described as a transient, who worked for the Respondent during the three day period giving rise to this complaint, and who was named by the Complainant in the complaint, could not be located. According to the Respondent, it is not reasonable to expect that somebody who\u2019s living in a homeless shelter can be located four and a half years later. The second potential witness, Jim Postlethwaite, who was also mentioned by the Complainant in the particulars of the complaint, was subpoenaed but could not attend the hearing due to the fact that he was incarcerated outside of the country at that time. According to the Respondent, Mr. Postlethwaite was available for the last four years, and had the case proceeded in a timely manner it would have had the benefit of his testimony.\n[14] Despite knowing of the Complainant\u2019s allegations since 2008 and the fact that Mr. Pilay is a transient, the Respondent indicated that it did not make attempts to locate Mr. Pilay until the Commission began investigating the complaint which at its earliest would have been some time after June 23, 2009 when Mr. Chaudhary filed his complaint with the Commission, after the BC Tribunal hearing. The Respondent testified that the last time it tried to locate Mr. Pilay was at least two years prior to the Hearing. No steps were taken to locate Mr. Pilay once a hearing date had been scheduled. Similarly, the Respondent indicated that it was anticipating\nMr. Postlethwaite being released prior to the hearing and had hoped he would therefore be able to attend the hearing. However, once the Respondent was made aware of Mr. Postlethwaite\u2019s situation and, subsequently, his unavailability to attend the hearing, it did not make a request to the Tribunal to adjourn these proceedings or explore other avenues of obtaining his evidence. As a result, I find that while the Respondent may have been prejudiced by the unavailability of these two witnesses, the unavailability is due to the Respondent\u2019s own inaction, and not due to delay per se.\n[15] The Respondent did have three witnesses appear at the hearing: Doug Bensley,\nBrad Burke and Kevin Carson. However, the Respondent claims that, due to delay, these witnesses no longer have a clear recollection of the events and evidentiary issues in this case. In hearing from these witnesses, they appeared to have good knowledge and recollection of the events giving rise to this complaint. They were able to give evidence independently, without notes or other aids, and remembered much of the detail surrounding the events in question. As a result, I also do not accept that any delay in these proceedings has caused witnesses\u2019 memories to fade on any of the key issues raised in the complaint, or, consequently, resulted in any significant prejudice to the Respondent.\n[16] Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s motion, dated March 22, 2012, is dismissed.\nB. Motion dated April 24, 2013 [17] The basis for the second motion to dismiss is the Tribunal\u2019s Practice Note No. 1, Re: Timeliness of Hearings and Decisions, dated October 22, 2007 (available online: http:\/\/chrt-tcdp.gc.ca\/NS\/about-apropos\/download\/pn-np-eng.asp), which provides:\nMoreover, the Tribunal intends to adhere firmly to the Parliament\u2019s directive in subsection 48.9(1), and to release decisions as often as possible within a four month time frame, in keeping with its stated commitment to Parliamentarians and Canadians as a whole.\n[18] According to the Respondent, over nine months have passed since the hearing and there has been no explanation or excuse for the delay in rendering a decision. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the delay is unacceptable as Smoother Movers has been in the public eye, accused of human rights violations, for over five years. Therefore, the Respondent requests the complaint be dismissed.\n[19] In this case, while the Tribunal was unable to adhere to its four month time frame for releasing decisions, aside from the actual delay, there is no proof that this has prejudiced the Respondent by causing injury to the Respondent\u2019s reputation. As mentioned above, \u201cdelay, without more, will not warrant a stay of proceedings as an abuse of process at common law\u201d (Blencoe at para. 115-121 and 133).\n[20] As a result, the Respondent\u2019s motion, dated April 24, 2013, is also dismissed\nIV. Merits of the Complaint A. Complainant\u2019s evidence [21] At the hearing of this matter, the Complainant testified as to his version of the events giving rise to this complaint. He describes himself as a brown skinned man of Middle Eastern descent.\n[22] In December 2007, the Complainant applied for a position with the Respondent. According to the Complainant, the job was posted on the Employment Canada job website and was for a permanent, full-time, moving van driver position. On these terms, the Complainant claims he was hired by Doug Bensley, doing business as Smoother Movers.\n[23] The Complainant worked for the Respondent for a three day period from December 17-19, 2007, moving an office. Among other things, the Complainant was asked to pack and move items from the office into an elevator to bring them down to the moving truck; to unload the items at the new office location; and, also, to assemble shelves and cubicles at the new location\n[24] From his first day of work, the Complainant claims employees of the Respondent made discriminatory comments relating to his race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. According to the Complainant, on December 17, 2007, he was in the elevator taking down a load with another employee, Jim Postlethwaite. The Complainant recounted the incident wherein he claims to have said to Mr. Postlethwaite: \u201cso they eliminated the Hate Crimes Act in USA\u201d. In response, the Complainant alleges that Mr. Postlethwaite made a comment regarding the fact that he wanted to move to the United States to start a KKK clan.\n[25] Also on December 17, 2007, the Complainant claims that another employee, Jason Pilay, kept calling him an Indian in the loading dock area at the old office location. The Complainant claims he told Mr. Pilay, \u201chey, man, that\u2019s not cool, bro...\u201d, but unfortunately, the comments continued.\n[26] On December 18, 2007, the Complainant claims a third employee, Brad Burke, started calling him a \u201cnigger\u201d. According to the Complainant, he asked Mr. Burke to define the term and explained to him that he did not fall within its definition. The Complainant claims that, thereafter, the term was used frequently throughout the day by the other employees and, specifically, that Mr. Pilay started making jokes using that term.\n[27] Also on December 18, 2007, the Complainant alleges a fourth employee, Kevin Carson, began asking him, in an east Indian accent: \u201cdo you eat curry?\u201d. The Complainant claims\nMr. Carson kept asking him the question repeatedly while taking up a load in the elevator.\n[28] Again on December 18, 2007, while in a tightly packed elevator taking down a load of cargo, the Complainant alleges Mr. Burke began rubbing his buttock on him. According to the Complainant, this made him very upset and he told Mr. Burke as much when he exited the elevator.\n[29] On December 19, 2007, the Complainant was asked to assemble a shelf. According to the Complainant, the project was a two person job; however, all the other employees were reluctant to help him and left him to complete the project on his own. While completing the task of putting the shelf together, the Complainant claims Doug Bensley came in and stated: \u201cYou\u2019re incompetent. Are you retiring in here?\u201d. The Complainant viewed this comment as implying he could not do the job right and that it was taking him too long to complete.\n[30] As he was nearing completion of the shelf project, the Complainant contends Mr. Carson came in, asking him what was taking so long and bent over as if to assist the Complainant. However, the Complainant claims Mr. Carson\u2019s pants were so low that he exposed his buttock to the Complainant. and that he left without assisting the Complainant. In another incident on that same day, while working on a cabinet unit, the Complainant alleges Mr. Burke\u2019s pants were so low that he also exposed his buttocks to the Complainant.\n[31] Also on December 19, 2007, the Complainant and some of the other employees were setting up office cubicles. According to the Complainant, he advised the other employees that the cubicles were not spaced properly. In response, the Complainant claims Mr. Burke, Mr. Carson and Mr. Pilay told him to \u201cshut-up, just stand there and hold the cubicle wall\u201d. When\nMr. Postlethwaite, the team leader, arrived, the Complainant claims he attempted to explain to him that the cubicles were not properly spaced and Mr. Postlethwaite started yelling at him and told him to \u201cGo home\u201d. In response, the Complainant stated: \u201cNo, let\u2019s keep moving forward and get the job done\u201d. The Complainant added that Mr. Postlethwaite later came to him stating he had been flustered from having got the moving van into an accident and, subsequently, getting into a conflict with a tow-truck driver.\n[32] After his December 19, 2007 shift, the Complainant alleges he received no more hours from the Respondent. He claims to have phoned Mr. Bensley shortly after December the 19th asking for more hours and inquiring as to when he would be paid. According to the Complainant, Mr. Bensley spoke to him abruptly and hung up on him. The Complainant was eventually paid for his three shifts, but did not return to work for the Respondent. The Complainant adds, despite being hired as a moving van driver, he was never given the opportunity to drive the moving van.\nB. Has the Complainant established a prima facie case? [33] The complainant in proceedings before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2026\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para. 28).\n[34] Based on the employees making racial comments towards him; Doug Bensley calling him incompetent; and, the employees showing their buttocks to him, the Complainant feels he was intentionally tormented and segregated in his work environment. In this regard, he alleges discrimination and harassment pursuant to section 7 and paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act.\n(i) Complainant\u2019s allegations under subsection 7(a) of the Act [35] Paragraph 7(a) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination. In complaints under subsection 7(a), the complainant must establish a link between a prohibited ground of discrimination and the employer's decision to refuse to employ or continue to employ him or her (see Roopnarine v. Bank of Montreal, 2010 CHRT 5 at para. 49). That said, discrimination does not need to be the only reason for the decision. It is sufficient that discrimination be one factor in the decision (see Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co., [1990] F.C.J. No. 419 (F.C.A.) (Q.L.); and, Khiamal v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), 2009 FC 495 at para. 61).\n[36] Based on the evidence provided by the Complainant, it is not clear why the Respondent did not offer the Complainant more hours following his December 19, 2007 shift; neither party subsequently contacted the other with regards to further work or lack of work. Arguably, the Complainant\u2019s evidence suggests that the Respondent may have had concerns with his competence. Ultimately the Complainant was not able to show a link between a refusal to continue to employ, if there was one, and a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[37] The Complainant testified that he was not able to bring to Mr. Bensley\u2019s attention the alleged discriminatory conduct that occurred between December 17-19, 2007. According to the Complainant, Mr. Bensley was intimidating and not approachable, and the Complainant was hesitant to raise the issue in fear that it might affect his employment. In any event, Mr. Bensley, the owner and operator of Smoother Movers, was not present during any of the events alleged to be discriminatory and no evidence was presented which would indicate that Mr. Bensley was aware of the alleged discrimination by his other employees until the BC Tribunal complaint. Nor did the Complainant allege any discriminatory conduct by Mr. Bensley. The fact that\nMr. Bensley may have called him incompetent is not related to a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[38] Therefore, I find the Complainant has not established a prima facie case pursuant to subsection 7(a) of the Act.\n(ii) Complainant\u2019s allegations under subsection 7(b) of the Act [39] Paragraph 7(b) of the Act provides that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee in the course of employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination. To \u201cdifferentiate\u201d is to create a distinction or to treat someone differently (see Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2009 FC 1009 at para. 44 [Tahmourpour]; varied on other grounds in Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2010 FCA 192 [Tahmourpour (FCA)]; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 at para. 254 aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 75 [FNCFCS]). However, not every distinction is discriminatory, as the Act qualifies the differential treatment with the term \u201cadversely\u201d. According to the Federal Court, \u201cadverse\u201d is an adjective that in its ordinary meaning means harmful, hurtful or hostile (see Tahmourpour at para. 44; see also Tahmourpour (FCA) at para. 12). Finally, the adverse differential treatment must be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination and does not require the Complainant to present evidence of how a comparator group is treated (FNCFCS, FCA at paras. 16-18).\n[40] There was insufficient evidence to suggest that the alleged comment from\nMr. Postlethwaite regarding starting a KKK clan was directed towards the Complainant because of his being a person of colour or that it affected him adversely. However, the Complainant testified that the other alleged racial comments and jokes directed towards him from the other employees were offensive to him. After his shift on December 18th, 2007, the Complainant claims he suffered mental anguish, making it difficult for him to sleep that night and causing him to be late for work the next day.\n[41] With regard to the alleged buttock incident in the elevator with Mr. Burke, the Complainant indicated that he told Mr. Burke to \u201cgo fuck himself\u201d. Following the other two alleged buttock incidents, where Mr. Carson and Mr. Burke\u2019s pants were hanging too low exposing their buttocks to the Complainant, the Complainant testified that he did not know what their intentions were, but he says he did not like it.\n[42] Overall, the Complainant felt traumatized by his three day employment with the Respondent. He feels as though the other employees at Smoother Movers were tormenting him because he was the new guy. According to the Complainant, the alleged discriminatory conduct he suffered while working for the Respondent has always been baffling to him and he says it has consumed his life for the last few years.\n[43] While the buttock incidents may have been unpleasant for the Complainant, I fail to see a link between the alleged conduct and the Complainant\u2019s sex. As the Complainant stated, \u201che did not know what their intentions were\u201d, aside from perhaps tormenting him because he was the new guy. Although the alleged conduct may have been improper, it does not result in prima facie adverse differentiation, on the basis of sex, pursuant to subsection 7(b) of the Act.\n[44] However, aside from Mr. Postlethwaite\u2019s comment, I accept that the other alleged racial comments and jokes distinguished the Complainant from the rest of his colleagues on the basis of his race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. As outlined above, those alleged comments and jokes were also hurtful to the Complainant.\n[45] Therefore, the Complainant has established a prima facie case pursuant to subsection 7(b) of the Act, on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, and colour.\n(iii) Complainant\u2019s allegations under paragraph 14(1)(c) of the Act [46] Within the meaning of section 14 of the Act, harassment has been defined as unwelcomed conduct, directed at another person on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination and harassment generally requires an element of persistence or repetition; however, the more serious the conduct and its consequences, the less repetition may be necessary. The severity of the impugned conduct is assessed from the perspective of the reasonable person in the circumstances (see Janzen v. Platy enterprises ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 1252; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), [1999] 3 FC 653 [Franke]). Finally, where the complaint against an employer involves the conduct of its\u2019 employees, fairness requires that the victim of the harassment, wherever possible, notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct (see Morin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 41, at para. 246).\n[47] In his first two days of work for the Respondent, on December 17-18, 2007, the Complainant testified that he had to persistently endure alleged comments and jokes from\nMr. Pilay, Mr. Burke and Mr. Carson regarding the Complainant\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. These comments were unwelcomed, as demonstrated by the Complainant\u2019s challenging Mr. Burke on his definition of the term \u201cnigger\u201d and by his testimony that he told Mr. Pilay that his comments were not appreciated. Therefore, I am of the view that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of harassment, under section 14 of the Act, on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, and colour.\n[48] Based on the buttock incidents, the Complainant also claims to have been sexually harassed. Pursuant to subsection 14(2) of the Act, sexual harassment is deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Sexual harassment requires that the conduct be sexual in nature, which includes a broad range of conduct, and is determined on a case-by-case basis based on the test of the reasonable person in the circumstances (see Franke).\n[49] I do not accept that the Complainant was sexually harassed. The buttock rubbing did not persist beyond the one incident in the elevator, after the Complainant got upset with Mr. Burke. From the perspective of the reasonable person, Based on the evidence I do not believe the conduct was sexual in nature. I also do not believe that the severity of this one incident would amount to harassment.\n[50] The other two incidents, where Mr. Carson and Mr. Burke allegedly exposed their buttock to the Complainant, also do not meet the standard for sexual harassment under the Act. Neither through words nor actions did the Complainant express to Mr. Carson and Mr. Burke that the conduct was unwanted; and, aside from these two incidents, the conduct did not persist. It is also questionable whether the conduct was sexual in nature. Certainly, the Complainant presented no evidence that the alleged acts were sexual in nature. Therefore, in my view, the Complainant has not established a prima face case of sexual harassment under the Act.\n[51] For all the above reasons, I am of the view that the Complainant has established a prima face case pursuant to subsection 7(b) and section 14 of the Act on the prohibited grounds of race, national or ethnic origin, and colour. I will now consider the Respondent\u2019s response to the prima facie discrimination\nC. Respondent\u2019s evidence [52] Once a complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the respondent must demonstrate that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act (see sections 15-24 of the Act).\n[53] At the hearing of this matter, Doug Bensley, Brad Burke and Kevin Carson testified on behalf of the Respondent. They claim the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged.\n[54] Mr. Bensley did not witness any of the prima facie discrimination and testified that the Complainant never reported any such incidents to him, whether during his three day employment with the Respondent or subsequently.\n[55] Mr. Burke testified that he has never witnessed or participated in racial harassment while working for Smoother Movers. He denies calling the Complainant a \u201cnigger\u201d or having a conversation with him regarding its definition. He also denies hearing any of the other staff using that sort of language or making any other comments or jokes with regard to the Complainant\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin, or colour.\n[56] Mr. Carson testified that he has never witnessed or participated in racial harassment while working for Smoother Movers. He denies calling the Complainant a \u201cnigger\u201d or mocking him in an East Indian accent. He also denies hearing any of the other staff using that sort of language or making any other comments or jokes with regard to the Complainant\u2019s race, national or ethnic origin, or colour.\nD. Has the Respondent established that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged? [57] The Complainant argues that Mr. Burke and Mr. Carson\u2019s testimony was not credible. He claims their testimony was rehearsed before hand with Mr. Bensley. The Complainant also pointed out that Mr. Burke is still working for the Respondent and, therefore, has a vested interest in protecting his employer and his own employment. In the same vein, the Complainant claims that Mr. Burke and Mr. Carson maintain a personal friendship with Mr. Bensley that extends beyond their professional relationship.\n[58] In hearing from all of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, I had no reason to question their credibility and was unable to identify any inconsistencies in their testimony. While they all categorically denied the Complainant\u2019s allegations, that does not necessarily mean that their testimony was coached. Mr. Bensley, Mr. Burke and Mr. Carson also denied having any sort of relationship beyond their professional relationship. Overall, I have no reason to believe that the Respondent\u2019s witnesses have misled the Tribunal.\n[59] On the other hand, I find it difficult to reconcile the Complainant\u2019s allegations with the fact that he never raised any of those allegations with his employer. He claims Mr. Bensley is intimidating and not approachable, and he was hesitant to raise the issues in fear that it might affect his employment. Despite this assertion, the Complainant was able to confront his alleged harassers about their conduct, challenging Mr. Burke on his use of the term \u201cnigger\u201d and asking Mr. Carson to stop calling him an Indian.\n[60] The Complainant was also able to speak up in the workplace regarding the problems he perceived with the December 18, 2007 job of assembling the cubicles. Despite claiming to be told to \u201cshut-up\u201d by Brad, Kevin and Jason, the Complainant also raised the issue subsequently with Jim as well.\n[61] The Complainant also testified to be a shrewd negotiator and, in this regard, was able to negotiate his rate of pay with Mr. Bensley. Following his three shifts with the Respondent,\nMr. Bensley claims the Complainant was difficult when it came to his rate of pay and, the Complainant specifically asked him how much he was going to get paid. There was a dispute as to whether the Complainant was to be paid as a labourer or a driver, the latter being at a higher rate of pay. Mr. Bensley wanted to pay him as a labourer. The Complainant argued that the job posting was for a moving van driver and, therefore, he should be paid based on the posting he responded to. Instead of arguing with the Complainant, Mr. Bensley claims to have acceded to the Complainant\u2019s request and paid him more than he would typically pay a labourer.\n[62] Finally, in his closing statements, the Complainant stated that he did approach\nMr. Bensley in early 2008 about Mr. Burke\u2019s behaviour and received no response from him (Transcript of hearing, at p. 489). This statement is inconsistent with the Complainant\u2019s testimony. In fact, later in his closing statement the Complainant went on to state:\nHad I had the opportunity to work for Mr. Bensley longer, I would have brought this information to his attention; however, Mr. Bensley did not give me an opportunity to meet with him again or work with him again. I had every intention to bring this to him; however, again, I was never given an opportunity to work with him or speak to him after and, as such, we are here today.\n(Transcript of hearing, at pp. 490-491)\n[63] Despite claiming to be intimidated to approach Mr. Bensley about the issues he was having in the workplace, in other similar situations, the Complainant had no problem speaking up. The inconsistency of his statements in paragraph 62 above, also casts doubt on the credibility of the Complainant\u2019s testimony.\n[64] I also find it difficult to reconcile the fact that, despite being offended and hurt by the other employees\u2019 alleged racial comments and jokes, and the alleged torment they were putting him through, the Complainant continued to interact with them in the workplace. The Complainant testified to taking smoke breaks with Mr. Postlethwaite and Mr. Carson and even stated that on December 19, 2007, he went to a cafeteria with Mr. Carson and Mr. Burke (Transcript of hearing, at p. 181). In my view, these facts also cast doubt on the credibility of the Complainant\u2019s testimony. I do not find it reasonable that the Complainant would attempt to ingratiate himself with his co-workers by socializing with them if he were so hurt, offended and feeling discriminated against by them.\n[65] In weighing the totality of the evidence presented by both parties, I find that the Respondent has established that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged.\nV. Conclusion [66] Weighing the Complainant\u2019s credibility against the credibility of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the prima facie discriminatory conduct did not occur as alleged by the Complainant.\n[67] Therefore, the complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nActing Tribunal Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 6, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1610\/15610\nStyle of Cause: Todd Chaudhary v.

Analysis and Decision. 17\nI. Context [1] The Complainants, the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society (the Caring Society) and the Assembly of First Nations (the AFN) have filed a human rights complaint alleging that the inequitable funding of child welfare services on First Nations reserves amount to discrimination on the basis of race and national ethnic origin, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c H-6 (the Act). The complaint was referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on October 14, 2008.\n[2] On December 21, 2009, the Respondent filed a motion for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground that the issues raised were beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction (the jurisdictional motion). The Tribunal ruled on the jurisdictional motion on March 14, 2011, in a decision reported at 2011 CHRT 4, and granted the motion, thereby dismissing the complaint. This decision was subsequently the subject of an application for judicial review before the Federal Court. On April 18, 2012, the Federal Court set aside the Tribunal\u2019s decision and remitted the matter to a differently constituted panel of the Tribunal for re-determination in accordance with its reasons (2012 FC 445). On July 10, 2012, a Panel composed of Members Marchildon, Lustig and B\u00e9langer, was appointed to hear this case (2012 CHRT 16).\nII. Relevant Facts [3] On September 26, 2012, the Tribunal held an in-person case management conference (CMC) to canvass parties\u2019 availabilities to schedule dates for the hearing on the merits. The Respondent requested an adjournment of the proceedings, pending the outcome of the appeal of the Federal Court\u2019s decision 2012 FC 445 that was scheduled to be heard by the Federal Court of Appeal in March 2013. The Panel ruled, dismissing the adjournment request. In agreement with the parties, the Tribunal set hearing dates for the week of February 25 to March 1, 2013, as requested by the Complainant, and set the remaining hearing dates starting in April 2013, as requested by the Respondent. The Tribunal also set, on consent, a timeline for ongoing filing of disclosure materials, including revised witness lists. The Respondent was to file three sets of disclosure on the following dates: October 31, 2012; December 28, 2012; and February 25, 2013.\n[4] The Respondent submitted its first set of disclosure and its Second Supplemental List of Documents on October 29, 2012, and its Third Supplemental List of Documents on December 20, 2013.\n[5] On January 22, 2013, the Tribunal held a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC). During the call, the Commission stated that it would provide its additional disclosure as soon as possible, most likely by the end of February 1, 2013. The Respondent confirmed that, for its part, it would be able to abide by the February 25, 2013 deadline, as set out during the September 26, 2012 Case Management Conference (CMC), for its third and final set of disclosure.\n[6] The Commission and the Respondent filed their Fourth Supplementary Lists of Documents on February 4, 2013 and February 21, 2013, respectively.\n[7] The hearing began on February 25, 2013. The Tribunal heard the testimony of Dr. Cindy Blackstock, Executive Director of First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, from February 25 to March 1, 2013. This was followed by another five days of hearing, April 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9, 2013, during which the Tribunal heard the testimonies of Mr. Jonathan Thompson, Director of Health and Social Development of the AFN, Dr. Nicolas Trocm\u00e9, Director of the Centre for Research on Children and Families at McGill University and Mr. Derald Dubois, Executive Director of the Touchwood Child and Family Services in Saskatchewan.\n[8] On March 6, 2013, the Federal Court of Appeal heard the appeal of the Federal Court\u2019s decision 2012 FC 445, which had remitted the present matter back to the Tribunal for re-determination. The Federal Court of Appeal rendered its decision 2013 FCA 75 shortly thereafter, on March 11, 2013, affirming the Federal Court\u2019s decision.\n[9] On April 24, 2013, the Tribunal received a letter from Mr. Champ, Counsel for the Caring Society, disclosing a CD-ROM containing information received by his client, Dr. Blackstock, on April 9, 2013, following a request for \u201cinformation on the enhanced funding approach\/model for First Nations Child and Family Services dated, or likely to be dated, between November 1, 2011 and October 31, 2012\u201d made pursuant to the Access to Information Act (ATIA). The Caring Society alleges that the package of documents received as a result of this request, totaling around 4000 pages, contained highly relevant documents for the complaint that should have been disclosed by the Respondent. The Caring Society further contends that some of these documents reveal the existence of additional documents that have not been disclosed by the Respondent and of documents that were withheld under a number of exemptions under the ATIA, which are not applicable to disclosure obligations in legal proceedings such as this one.\n[10] On May 7, 2013, the Respondent replied to the Caring Society\u2019s correspondence of April 24, 2013, stating that, as it had expressed throughout the CMCCs since the reconvening of this matter in 2012, it possessed a substantial number of documents that have yet to be disclosed and that this disclosure is ongoing. The Respondent also advised that it had just received notice from its client that over 50,000 additional documents that have been identified as potentially relevant, which the client is in the process of gathering, remain to be disclosed. In addition, the Respondent stated that it had been advised that there are an unspecified number of email documents that are also subject to disclosure and that the expected date of completion of gathering, indexing and providing these documents is between September and December 2013. Included in this number are, allegedly, documents which originate from the regions, as well as from headquarters. The Respondent stated that it believed it had now disclosed most of the documents up to 2010.\n[11] On May 9, 2013, the Caring Society replied to this letter, stating that while it was recognized that there would always be ongoing disclosure, it was never contemplated or understood that the Respondent had yet to disclose such a large number of relevant documents. Rather, the Caring Society understood that disclosure obligations had largely been met by February 25, 2013. The Caring Society also stated that it finds the September to December 2013 timeframe projected by the Respondent unacceptable as this would result in the disclosure of a large number of relevant documents after all the witnesses had testified. The Caring Society advised of its intention to address the issue with the Tribunal on May 13, 2013, and to seek an order that the Respondent be required to produce all of its disclosure by June 14, 2013.\n[12] On May 13, 2013, the Tribunal reconvened for a third week of hearings. In light of the latest exchanges regarding the issues with disclosure, the Tribunal asked the parties if they would benefit from additional time to discuss these issues amongst themselves and try and come to an agreement. The parties consented and the Tribunal adjourned for the day. The following day, in a letter dated May 14, 2013, the Caring Society advised the Tribunal that despite their discussions, the parties had not come to an agreement.\nIII. The Respondent\u2019s Motion for an Adjournment and the Complainant\u2019s Motion for an Order for Production [13] On May 15, 2013, the Respondent filed a motion seeking an order under Rules 1(6), 3(2)(d), 5(3)(d) and (f) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (the Tribunal Rules), for an adjournment of the hearing dates scheduled in the present matter until after such time as the Respondent could complete its disclosure obligations. These Rules read as follows:\n1(6) The Panel retains the jurisdiction to decide any matter of procedure not provided for by these Rules.\n1(6) Le membre instructeur conserve le pouvoir de se prononcer sur toute question de proc\u00e9dure non pr\u00e9vue par les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles.\n3(2) Upon receipt of a Notice of Motion, the Panel\n(d) shall dispose of the motion as it sees fit.\n3(2) D\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, le membre instructeur\nd) doit disposer de la requ\u00eate de la fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9e.\n5(3) At the case conference the Panel,\n(d) may set dates for the hearing of the inquiry;\n(f) may deal with any other matters necessary for the conduct of the proceeding.\n5(3) \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire, le membre instructeur\nd) peut fixer les dates d\u2019audience;\nf) peut traiter de toute autre question ayant trait au d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[14] The Respondent submits that an adjournment in this case would be appropriate as Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (AANDC) has retained two independent, third-party companies, namely Public History Inc. (PHI) and Canadian Development Consultants Inc. (CDCI), which have identified approximately 50,000 documents that are potentially relevant to the hearing of the complaint and that will not be disclosed to the Respondent before September 30, 2013. The Respondent submits that once it has received these documents, it will have to review them for relevance and privilege prior to disclosing them to the other parties, which will require additional time.\n[15] Because these documents may contain information that is relevant to the complaint, the Respondent notes that they may also be relevant to the questioning of the witnesses called by all parties. The Respondent submits that, having regard to the principles of natural justice, an adjournment would ensure that the record before the Tribunal is complete and that all parties have the opportunity to receive and review the documents and fully canvass the issues before the Tribunal. This would ensure the best use of judicial resources as, in the event the hearing proceeds as presently scheduled, witnesses may have to be recalled to address new information that was not available at the time they testified.\n[16] On May 21, 2013, the Caring Society filed its own Notice of Motion, seeking an order:\n[C]ompelling the Respondent to produce documents relevant to the complaint, provide summaries of anticipated testimony of each of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, legal costs for obstruction of the Tribunal process, and such further and other relief as counsel may request and this Honourable Tribunal may permit.\n[17] The Caring Society submits that despite the fact that the hearing on the merits of the present case has been ongoing since February 25, 2013, the Respondent has only recently admitted that it has in its possession tens of thousands of arguably relevant documents that it has failed to disclose to the parties. Combined with the Respondent\u2019s failure to produce summaries of the anticipated testimony of its witnesses as per its obligations under Rule 6(1)(f) of the Tribunal Rules, the Caring Society contends that the Respondent is in breach of Rules 1(1), 6(1) and 6(5)b) of the Tribunal Rules. The Caring Society also notes that the Respondent has repeatedly breached time limits set out by the Tribunal for the disclosure of documents, as well as for providing witness lists and expert reports.\n[18] For ease of reference, we have reproduced the above-mentioned Tribunal Rules. They read as follows:\n1(1) These Rules are enacted to ensure that\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner; and\n(c) all proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\n1(1) Les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ont pour objet de permettre\na) que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\nb) que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace;\nc) que toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible.\n6(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(a) the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case;\n(b) its position on the legal issues raised by the case;\n(c) the relief that it seeks;\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(e) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(f) a list identifying all witnesses the party intends to call, other than expert witnesses, together with a summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness.\n6(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\na) les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause;\nb) sa position au sujet des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause;\nc) le redressement recherch\u00e9;\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\ne) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\nf) les noms des divers t\u00e9moins \u2013 autres que les t\u00e9moins experts \u2013 qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d\u2019eux.\n6(5) A party shall provide such additional disclosure and production as is necessary\n(b) where the party discovers that its compliance with 6(1)(d), 6(1)(e), 6(1)(f), 6(3) or 6(4) is inaccurate or incomplete.\n6(5) Une partie doit divulguer et produire les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessaires\nb) si elle constate qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e correctement ou compl\u00e8tement aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d), 6(1)e) et 6(1)f) ou aux paragraphes 6(3) ou 6(4).\n[19] The Tribunal heard the two motions on May 21-22, 2013.\n[20] The Tribunal first heard the Respondent\u2019s motion to adjourn and the evidence of Ms. Pia Newell Santiago, Co-President of PHI, Ms. Laurie Howe, Project Manager at CDCI and Ms. Janice Mah, Paralegal at the Department of Justice Canada.\n[21] The evidence revealed that PHI has been conducting research and document management services for AANDC for the purposes of disclosure in the present proceedings since 2008 and that it began its current stage of research and document management in October 2012. At the time, PHI informed the Respondent that its projected date of completion was the end of March 2013, but that there was a risk that this deadline would have to be pushed back into the summer months. The Tribunal heard evidence regarding the large number of documents that have been (and those that remain to be) reviewed due to the broad scope of the issues at stake. While the Respondent narrowed the scope of relevance in 2012, Ms. Newell Santiago testified that the research and document management requirements remained labour-intensive as the scope of relevance was expanded so as to include the records of all the AANDC regional offices, in addition to AANDC headquarters.\n[22] Ms. Newell Santiago testified that in January or February 2013, PHI held discussions with the Respondent regarding the fact that processing material from the AANDC regional offices would be too much work for the company. PHI recommended that, with the exception of the emails emanating from the regional offices, the research and preparation of documents from the regional offices be assigned to another firm. PHI confirmed that the current anticipated completion date for its part of the work is August 31, 2013; a date which Ms. Newell Santiago testified was communicated to the Respondent no later than the middle of the month of March 2013. However, under cross-examination by the Commission, Ms. Newell Santiago noted that if the processing of the regional emails was removed from their task list, the projected August 31, 2013 end date could perhaps be advanced to mid-July, 2013.\n[23] Ms. Howe testified that the Respondent contacted CDCI on March 14, 2013, which the Tribunal notes is three days after the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal 2013 FCA 75. On that same date, the Respondent requested their assistance and by way of a finalized contract, retained their services on April 15, 2013. Pursuant to this contract, CDCI was to undertake the electronic document collection for the AANDC regional offices from April 2009 to present; the Quebec Regional Office email collection; and any small paper document collections from the regional offices. Ms. Howe highlighted the challenges in completing the production of such a large volume of material within such a short timeline, stating that CDCI\u2019s projected completion date is September 30, 2013, at the earliest.\n[24] The evidence also revealed that neither PHI nor CDCI had carriage of the research and preparation of documents emanating from the Audit and Evaluations branch of AANDC, an area which the Complainants expressed was of particular relevance to their case. The Respondent subsequently confirmed that a third, unknown firm, has recently been hired by the Respondent to obtain all relevant documentation from this branch. The Respondent was, however, unable to provide greater details on this service contract.\n[25] The Tribunal subsequently heard, in support of the Caring Society\u2019s motion for production, the evidence of Dr. Blackstock, Executive Director of the Caring Society. Dr. Blackstock emphasized the extent to which reviewing the large amount of disclosure in the present case constituted a heavy burden for their small organization and also the surprise and inconvenience caused upon learning, as a result of her latest ATIA request, that two thirds of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure was still outstanding. Dr. Blackstock explained that parts of this outstanding disclosure, such as the evaluations and audits of the implementation of the Enhanced Formula in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Alberta, Prince Edward Island and Quebec, was of particular relevance to their case, especially in light of the fact that the witnesses from Manitoba were initially scheduled to testify during the hearing dates scheduled in May 2013. Dr. Blackstock alleged that, furthermore, the documents disclosed as a result of the ATIA request indicated that the Respondent\u2019s litigation team was in possession of these documents well into the summer of 2012, begging the question as to why these documents were not previously disclosed. Dr. Blackstock also highlighted that, to date, the Caring Society has only received an incomplete list of witnesses and will-says.\n[26] In response to the Respondent\u2019s motion for an adjournment, Dr. Blackstock highlighted the prejudice that has already been caused to the 161 000 children served by this complaint as a result of the delays in the present case. Dr. Blackstock submitted that an adjournment, which would cause additional delays, would only exacerbate this prejudice.\nIV. Parties\u2019 Submissions A. Respondent\u2019s position [27] The Respondent asks for an adjournment until all of the disclosure has been completed, which, taking into account the evidence submitted by the third-party companies hired for this purpose and the time needed for the Respondent to review the disclosure provided, it estimates would be until early November 2013.\n[28] While the Respondent appreciates the parties\u2019 desire to proceed with the inquiry as expeditiously as possible, it highlights that this must be balanced with maintaining the fairness and integrity of the process, particularly in light of the important nature of the present case. The Respondent submits that at this stage of the proceedings, the testimonies of the majority of witnesses who have already been heard would not be affected by the late disclosure. However, in its view, proceeding with the hearing as it is currently scheduled, where witnesses would be testifying prior to the completion of the documentary disclosure, could create a situation where the testimonies are impacted, thereby raising issues of fairness.\n[29] Relying on its own notes of the September 26, 2012 CMC (due to a technical glitch, this conference was unfortunately not recorded), the Respondent further notes that it communicated to all parties on this date that it would provide ongoing disclosure and that it expected to disclose an estimated 30,000 documents. The Respondent admits that while there may have been a misunderstanding regarding the amount of outstanding disclosure, the Respondent brought this issue to the attention of the parties as soon as it was made aware of the existence of additional potentially relevant documents.\n[30] The Respondent expressed a willingness to work with the parties in order to establish a reasonable schedule to ensure the completion of the disclosure so as to proceed in the most just and efficient manner.\nB. The Caring Society\u2019s position [31] The Caring Society submits that there has already been a breach of procedural fairness as there have already been two weeks of hearings and the parties have only recently been made aware of the Respondent\u2019s large amount of outstanding disclosure documents. The Caring Society also submits that its understanding regarding any ongoing disclosure referred to documents and evidence that came into existence after the beginning of the proceedings and did not contemplate, contrary to what the Respondent\u2019s submits, the disclosure of large amounts of documents produced prior to February 25, 2013.\n[32] That said, the Caring Society submits that the impact of the Respondent\u2019s late disclosure remains speculative and does not justify the adjournment of nine weeks of previously scheduled hearings. The Caring Society is of the view that any fairness concerns arising as a result of witnesses testifying prior to full disclosure may be remedied in a variety of ways, including by requests to recall witnesses to address previously undisclosed documents. The Caring Society recognizes that having all the documents prior to moving forward with the proceedings is undoubtedly ideal. However, when weighed against the very concrete prejudice to the Complainants caused by further delays, these speculative future breaches of fairness do not warrant the adjournment sought by the Respondent. Indeed, the First Nations children who are adversely affected by the Respondent\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practices can never regain those primary years spent away from home.\n[33] The Caring Society notes that the evidence of Ms. Newell Santiago revealed that the Respondent knew in January or February of 2013 that a large amount of documents would not be available for disclosure until the summer and yet failed to inform the parties of this fact until recently. The evidence of Ms. Howe also revealed that, when CDCI was initially contacted by the Respondent in mid-March of 2013, she gave a projected completion date of end of July 2013, a fact which the Respondent also failed to communicate to the other parties. The Caring Society submits that this evidence, combined with the Respondent\u2019s failure to offer an explanation as to why it only began processing these relevant documents very recently, should lead to a negative inference; these documents may have never been disclosed were it not for Dr. Blackstock\u2019s ATIA request. It is the Caring Society\u2019s view that granting the adjournment request would only accommodate what it describes as the Respondent\u2019s \u201cown knowing breach of the Tribunal Rules\u201d. The Caring Society states that it was unable to find a single case where a party had failed to disclose and then sought an adjournment on this basis.\n[34] The Caring Society also argues that the adjournment requested in the present case would impact the functioning of the Tribunal as it will have to vacate all of the current dates and set aside future dates that could otherwise have been available to other complaints. The Caring Society relies on Zhou v. National Research Council, 2009 CHRT 11, wherein the Tribunal stated that in deciding to grant an adjournment, the Tribunal should have consideration for the prejudice caused to the whole Tribunal system (at paragraphs 7 and 8).\n[35] Finally, the Caring Society notes that the Respondent has also failed to provide a full list of witnesses with will-say statements despite repeated requests and contrary to Rule 6(1)(f) of the Tribunal Rules and should be ordered to produce this information.\nC. The Commission\u2019s position [36] The Commission is of the view that the need to proceed in an expeditious manner must be balanced with the need to ensure that the process moves along fairly and with the best evidence. While there may be some initial savings of time in refusing to adjourn the hearing dates as they are currently set, the Commission notes that these savings are likely to be offset by the delays caused by recalling witnesses and also create the risk of compromising the quality of the case and the testimony of the witnesses. Proceeding without having concluded the disclosure could also result in the creation of flaws within the record which could be problematic in the event of a judicial review.\n[37] That said, the Commission is not in agreement with the Respondent\u2019s proposal of commencing hearings in November or December 2013. As such, the Commission has adopted what it describes as a middle ground position. According to the evidence brought forward by Ms. Newell Santiago and Ms. Howe, if parties agree to dispend PHI and CDCI with the obligation of conducting ATIA cross-referencing and coding the disclosure, then PHI would be in a position to provide the disclosure to the Respondent at the end of June and CDCI could do the same at the end of July 2013. The Commission therefore proposes that:\na. the motion on the issue of retaliation be heard in June;\nb. the Respondent provide a rolling disclosure until July 26, 2013; and\nc. the Commission proceed with its case on the merits in early August and conclude its witnesses by mid-September.\n[38] The Commission requests that, in order to avoid a situation where parties are faced with further adjournment requests down the line, the Tribunal render an order detailing the documentary disclosure schedule proposed and provide a deadline for the production of the witness list and will-say statements.\n[39] While the AFN notes that it shares the same concerns as the Caring Society in respect of the conduct of the Respondent regarding the handling of the documentary disclosure and the frequent breaches of timeframes, it nonetheless supports the position and schedule proposed by the Commission. The Commission\u2019s position was also supported by the Chiefs of Ontario (the COO).\nV. Events since the Motions Hearing [40] In a letter dated May 24, 2013, the Respondent indicated that following further communications with the independent companies contracted to obtain the disclosure, PHI had advised that they could provide the disclosure documents to the Respondent by July 2, 2013 and CDCI had indicated that they could do so by July 31, 2013. As a result, the Respondent stated that it would be in a position to provide a rolling disclosure at intervals throughout June, July and August, completing its disclosure by August 31, 2013. The Respondent indicated that it would therefore be in a position to proceed with hearings on the retaliation complaint in July or August 2013 and, to resume hearings on the merits of the case, in September 2013. While the Respondent initially noted that this was contingent upon the parties waiving the disclosure of emails, it subsequently confirmed that it would be in a position to complete the disclosure, including emails, by August 31, 2013. The Respondent also advised that the regional documents could be disclosed in the following order: Atlantic, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia and Yukon.\n[41] In a letter dated May 28, 2013, the Commission, without waiving any rights, consented to the Respondent\u2019s latest proposal, given the caveat that the Respondent\u2019s emails would be included in the disclosure. The Commission also noted that the third unknown company, with whom the Respondent has contracted to deal with the production of documents pertaining to audits and evaluations, would also have to abide by the proposed timeframes. The Commission proposed that the hearing on the merits resume on September 3, 2013.\n[42] The COO sent an email that same day, supporting the position of the Commission. The AFN also sent a letter dated May 28, 2013, supporting the Commission\u2019s position, subject to the right of the Commission and the Complainants to recall witnesses. The AFN also highlighted the importance of scheduling dates through December 2013 so as to ensure that the Respondent is able to complete its case and that the hearing is completed with the least amount of delay possible.\n[43] The Caring Society also responded to the Respondent\u2019s letter, having reviewed the Commission\u2019s response. The Caring Society continued to express its objection to the adjournment, noting that the impact of the late disclosure remained highly speculative and did not warrant adjourning nine weeks of previously scheduled hearings particularly in light of the continued prejudice suffered by First Nations children adversely affected by the Respondent\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practices.\n[44] On May 29, 2013, the Respondent replied to these communications, expressing satisfaction at the agreement of the Commission, the Chiefs of Ontario and the AFN to the timelines for disclosure that the Respondent proposed in its last communication. In response to the Caring Society\u2019s objection, the Respondent stated that it felt that the evidence presented by the witnesses clearly indicates that important and relevant documents remain to be disclosed, supporting the request for an adjournment.\n[45] On May 30, 2013, the Tribunal held a CMCC, during which the Commission provided an updated proposed timeline. This proposal included the following:\na. setting dates for the retaliation issue anytime in the hearing weeks already scheduled in June, July and August;\nb. August 30, 2013, as the Respondent\u2019s disclosure deadline; and\nc. the hearing on the merits scheduled to start September 3, 2013.\n[46] This proposal was supported by the AFN and the Chiefs of Ontario. The Caring Society maintained its objection to the adjournment, referring to its submissions of May 28, 2013.\nVI. Letter Decision [47] Concerned with the practical implications of a decision on the two motions and with the desire to provide the parties with greater certainty in moving forward with this case as quickly as possible, the Tribunal issued a decision in the form of a letter on June 3, 2013, with reasons to follow. The letter decision reads as follows:\nThis is a point form decision on the Respondent\u2019s adjournment motion and the First Nations Child and Family Caring Society\u2019s motion for a production order and costs with reasons to follow. The costs issue is taken under reserve and will be the subject of a further, subsequent ruling.\nThe Respondent\u2019s adjournment motion is allowed in part; The First Nations Child and Family Caring Society\u2019s motion for a production order is allowed in part.\nThe CHRC, AFN and the Chiefs of Ontario consent to the Respondent\u2019s request to adjourn the hearing in the above-noted matter and to reconvene on September 3, 2013 pending the Respondent\u2019s full and complete disclosure, which is to be completed by no later than August 31, 2013. The CHRC, AFN and the Chiefs of Ontario also consent to proceeding with the allegations of retaliation during the hearing weeks currently scheduled in July or August, 2013, The Caring Society, AFN, CHRC, and the Chiefs of Ontario are reserving the right to recall witnesses if needed. The Caring Society does not consent to the adjournment of the hearing dates.\nThe Panel\u2019s decision is as follows:\nThe hearing dates in June 2013 are adjourned. The hearing will reconvene on July 15, 2013, continuing until July 26, 2013, and will cover the allegations of retaliation. In addition, three days in August 2013 will be set aside to complete the hearing on the allegations of retaliation, should the July two-week period prove to be insufficient. These days are August 6 to 8, 2013.\nThe hearing on the merits will resume on the remaining dates already scheduled from August 12 to 16, 2013 and August 26 to 30, 2013. The hearing will continue in September and into the fall until the completion of the hearing on the merits and in accordance with the Panel\u2019s and the parties\u2019 availabilities which will be discussed during the June 6, 2013, conference call. Please find enclosed a letter detailing the Panel\u2019s availabilities in this regard.\nThe Respondent\u2019s disclosure will be completed by no later than August 31, 2013. The Respondent will provide the disclosure to the parties, in accordance with the schedule provided by the Commission, dated May 28, 2013. The parties are requested to further detail the content of the disclosure as per the schedule at the June 6, 2013 conference call. In the event that the parties do not reach an agreement in this regard, the Panel will render a ruling on this issue at the same time as it renders its reasons on the two motions.\nThe parties will have the right to recall witnesses if needed and with the Panel\u2019s approval. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis, following an assessment of each situation.\nThe Respondent will file its list of witnesses and detailed will-says for the hearing on the allegations of retaliation by no later than July 2, 2013. The Respondent will file its list of witnesses and detailed will-says for the hearing on the merits of the case by no later than August 31, 2013.\n[48] The reasons for this decision follow below.\nVII. Analysis and Decision [49] The two motions in the present case, as recognized by the parties themselves, represent essentially two sides of the same coin. The Tribunal must determine, in light of the evidence presented and the risks of proceeding without the benefit of full disclosure, whether or not circumstances warrant granting the adjournment requested by the Respondent and if so, for how long. Should the Tribunal decide that an adjournment is not warranted and, as contended by the Caring Society, that principles of fairness and efficiency support the position that the proceedings should continue as currently scheduled, then the Tribunal must determine the most appropriate manner to maintain the integrity of its process in light of the large amount of outstanding documents to be disclosed by the Respondent.\n[50] It is well established that the Tribunal is the master of its own procedure and the adjournment of proceedings falls within its discretion. This discretion must be exercised with consideration for section 48.9(1) of the Act and the requirement that proceedings be conducted informally and expeditiously, subject to the rules of natural justice: Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at paras. 14, 15, 16 and 17; Zhou v. National Research Council, supra at para. 4; L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railway Company, Interim Ruling, November 26, 1999 (CHRT) at para. 6; Marshall v. Cerescorp Co., 2011 CHRT 5; Blain v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2012 CHRT 13.\n[51] The considerations which the Tribunal must weigh in deciding to exercise this discretion in the present case include:\na. the prejudice caused to the Commission, the Complainants and the children they represent in delaying this matter for several weeks;\nb. the prejudice caused to the Commission, who is leading the evidence, in proceeding without delay and hearing the testimony of its witnesses without the benefit of the Respondent\u2019s full disclosure, creating the risk of not having all relevant documents;\nc. the prejudice caused to the Respondent if required to review the disclosure and prepare its case in a short timeframe during the summer months;\nd. the impact to the Tribunal system in delaying the proceedings and having to find additional hearing dates suitable to all Tribunal members and parties; and\ne. the impact to the integrity of the Tribunal process in continuing with the proceedings without the benefit of the Respondent\u2019s full disclosure.\n[52] As these considerations demonstrate, there is no obvious solution to the issue at hand. At least one, if not all parties, will suffer a prejudice regardless of the decision taken.\n[53] We note that the Respondent\u2019s conduct here is far from irreproachable. As demonstrated by the evidence brought by the Caring Society as a result of Dr. Blackstock\u2019s ATIA request, the Respondent knew of the existence of a number of these documents, prejudicial to its case and highly relevant, in the summer of 2012 and yet failed to disclose them. The evidence also showed that the Respondent knew that it would be unable to complete its disclosure by February 25, 2013, as had been agreed upon since October of 2012. There were numerous occasions, including two CMCCs prior to the beginning of the hearing, when the Respondent could have raised the fact that there was a strong possibility that it would be unable to meet its disclosure obligations. The Tribunal, at every CMCC and in all communications sent to the parties, repeatedly expressed that if any issues or concerns were to arise in between meetings and calls, the parties should contact the Tribunal. No such contact was ever made. The Respondent attended the hearing dates in April 2013 knowing full well that its disclosure requirement was incomplete. Furthermore, it had just entered into a contract with CDCI to assist in completing its disclosure requirement and had been informed by this company that it would take until the end of September 2013, at the earliest, to complete the production of the large amount of material that was still undisclosed. The Respondent withheld this information from the parties and the Tribunal. Only following the Caring Society\u2019s letter regarding the ATIA request, in a letter dated May 7, 2013, shortly before the third week of the hearing was scheduled to commence, did the Respondent inform the parties and the Tribunal of the existence of 50,000 additional outstanding disclosure documents.\n[54] The efforts of all involved in a case of this magnitude should be noted. The Commission, who has carriage of the case, has devoted three lawyers to the file, the AFN has devoted two lawyers and the Caring Society\u2019s Executive Director, Dr. Blackstock or her counsel, Mr. Paul Champ, have been present throughout the proceedings so far. The Respondent itself has assigned four lawyers to the matter. In addition, a number of interveners have devoted significant time and resources to their involvement in the case. The Tribunal assigned a three-Member Panel, noting that this was a challenge in light of the Tribunal\u2019s workload and Member availability: First Nations Child and Family Caring Society et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, 2012 CHRT 16 at paragraph 29. As pointed out by the Caring Society, the three Members assigned would all have otherwise been hearing three separate sets of cases as per the Tribunal\u2019s usual single Member practice. Thirteen weeks in everyone\u2019s schedules were set aside, witnesses were scheduled to appear and hearing facilities were booked.\n[55] As stated by Member Karen Jensen (as she then was) in Zhou at paragraph 8:\nThe Tribunal must run an efficient hearing system in order to achieve its legislative mandate to hear and resolve complaints expeditiously (s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA; Canada Post Corporation v. PSAC and the CHRC, 2008 FC 223 at para. 274; Nova Scotia Construction Safety Association, Collins and Kelly v. Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission and Davidson, 2006 NSCA 63 at para. 76. A hearing requires the dedication of considerable financial and human resources. Those resources cannot be reallocated without significant disruption to the whole system, especially at this stage in the process. Such disruptions have an impact on the timeliness not only of the present case, but also of other cases in the system. For those reasons, an adjournment is granted only in cases where proceeding will clearly have an impact on the fairness of the hearing.\n[56] Had the Respondent communicated the challenges it faced in obtaining these large amounts of disclosure, the Tribunal, with the parties, could have worked together to come to a solution that would have minimized the impact to the proceedings and on all parties involved. By advising parties and the Tribunal of this at, what is now well past the last hour, the Respondent has denied this opportunity to everyone and forced the Tribunal, to put it bluntly, into a mode of damage control. It is also worth mentioning that the Respondent is the one who has failed to comply with its disclosure obligations, causing prejudice to the opposite parties, and yet is the one seeking an adjournment.\n[57] The Respondent argues that it informed the parties that the disclosure would be ongoing and that it expected its disclosure to contain approximately 30,000 documents in the September 26, 2012 CMC, implying that the recent adjusted estimate of 50,000 documents is not so far off and should therefore not come as a complete surprise to the parties.\n[58] With respect, we do not share this position. The projection of the disclosure of 30,000 documents was set to be made in three sets until February 25, 2013, and many thousands have indeed been disclosed to date. The 50,000 documents referred to in the Respondent\u2019s letter dated May 7, 2013, are additional documents and are referred to as such by the Respondent itself. It cannot be said that the Respondent previously advised the parties of this fact. Moreover, an ongoing duty to disclose cannot be interpreted as including 50,000 outstanding documents amounting to two thirds of the remaining disclosure. The Commission and the Complainants, like the Tribunal, understood that with the exception of newly-created documents, the Respondent\u2019s disclosure obligations would be met by February 25, 2013. It bears highlighting that the Tribunal explicitly confirmed with the Respondent during the September 26, 2012 CMC that the established disclosure timeline provided for sufficient time for the Respondent to meet its disclosure obligations.\n[59] The Tribunal shares the concerns of the Caring Society in granting an adjournment which will cause delays to the proceedings. The present complaint, filed in February of 2007 and referred to the Tribunal by the Commission on October 14, 2008, has already been marked by a number of significant delays. However, the Tribunal must also be mindful of its duty to provide parties with a full and ample opportunity to present their case and make representations: L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railway Company, Interim Ruling, November 26, 1999 (CHRT) at para. 6. See also Zhou v. National Research Council, supra at para. 4. Once the companies hired by AANDC have completed their disclosure work and the Respondent has completed its review, the Complainants and the Commission will also need time to complete their own review of the documents and to prepare their case accordingly. The Commission, who, as previously stated, is leading most of the evidence, expressed the desire to move expeditiously without compromising the quality of the evidence. The Tribunal shares the Commission\u2019s desire.\n[60] It is for these reasons that the Tribunal has decided to allow, in part, both the Respondent\u2019s adjournment motion and the Caring Society\u2019s production motion. As stated in the Letter Decision reproduced above, the Tribunal is vacating the dates originally scheduled in June of 2013. The following weeks are set aside for the hearing of the allegations of retaliation:\na. July 15 to 19, 2013\nb. July 22 to 26, 2013\nc. August 6 to 8, 2013\n[61] The hearing on the merits, as per the parties\u2019 availabilities stated during the June 6, 2013 CMCC, is scheduled for the following weeks:\na. August 12 to 16, 2013\nb. August 26 to 30, 2013\nc. September 3 to 6, 2013\nd. September 9 to 13, 2013\ne. September 23 to 27, 2013\nf. October 28 to November 1, 2013\ng. November 4 to 9, 2013\nh. November 12 to 15, 2013\ni. December 2 to 6, 2013\nj. December 9 to 13, 2013\nk. January 6 to 10, 2014\nl. January 13 to 17, 2014\n[62] The parties will have the right to recall witnesses if needed and with the Panel\u2019s approval. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis, following an assessment of each situation.\n[63] The Respondent is to file its list of witnesses and detailed will-say statements for the hearing on the allegations of retaliation by no later than July 2, 2013.\n[64] The Respondent is to file its list of witnesses and detailed will-say statements for the hearing on the merits of the case by no later than August 31, 2013.\n[65] The Respondent\u2019s disclosure is to be completed by no later than August 31, 2013. As agreed upon by the parties in the June 6, 2013 CMCC, the Respondent is to provide an ongoing, rolling disclosure to the parties approximately every three weeks, so as to avoid the disclosure of documents in bulk on the last day of the disclosure schedule.\n[66] The parties have also agreed that the cut-off date for the Respondent\u2019s disclosure is December 5, 2012, for searches relating to documents from AANDC Headquarters and February 22, 2013, for documents in the audit and accountability section. This agreement is subject to other documents of relevance that might come to the Respondent\u2019s attention outside of this timeframe, which the Respondent would also have to disclose.\n[67] The costs request made by the Caring Society and the AFN is taken under reserve.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nPanel Chairperson\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Craig\nDate: July 5, 2013\nCitation: 2013 CHRT 17\n[1] By Notice of Motion filed April 24, 2013, the Complainants requested an order seeking further implementation of the January 26, 2011 Tribunal decision (2011 CHRT 2) concerning their complaint that Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) had subjected them to discriminatory practices in the manner in which INAC processed their applications for a s. 58(3) locatee lease.\n[2] The Motion was triggered by the April 10, 2013 decision of Madam Justice Hansen of the Federal Court of Canada in judicial review of both the Tribunal decision of January 26, 2011, affirming the merits of their complaint of discrimination, and the subsequent Tribunal decision of February 24, 2012 (2012 CHRT 2) in clarification of remedies ordered with respect to discriminatory practices engaged in by INAC.\n[3] The Motion was heard on June 20, 2011, with oral and written submissions being presented by the parties.\n[4] In their Motion the Complainants sought an order with respect to changes in INAC\u2019s land-management-Manual, an ongoing collateral remedial matter between the Canadian Human Rights Commission and INAC, a process in which the Complainants are without privity. They also raised constitutional questions which were unrelated to the matters dealt with in either of the Tribunal decisions.\n[5] Significantly, it was acknowledged by the Complainants that on or about April 11, 2011, they had withdrawn their applications for locatee leases.\n[6] I conclude that withdrawal of their application for locatee leases nullifies the allegation in the Complainant`s Motion that the Respondent engaged in on-going acts of discrimination. As the Respondent counsel put it: The Complainants\u2019 Motion has been overtaken by events and is moot.\n[7] Lastly, I conclude that the Respondent complied with a specific direction of Madam Justice Hansen and withdrew its application for judicial review of the initial Tribunal decision (2011 CHRT 2). In the result the initial decision stands, beyond appeal, as case-law binding on the parties, spent of its remedial validity.\nDetermination\n[8] In accordance with the foregoing determinations the Complainants\u2019 Notice of Motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

        "unofficial_text":"Seeley v. Canadian National Railway\nCollection\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nDate\n2013-07-18\nNeutral citation\n2013 CHRT 18\nDecision-maker(s)\nDoucet, Michel\nDecision type\nRuling\nGrounds\nFamily Status\nDecision Content\nBetween:\nDenise Seeley\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nCanadian National Railway\nRespondent\nRuling\nMember: Michel Doucet\nDate: July 18, 2013\nCitation: 2013 CHRT 18\n[1] Denise Seeley, (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) brings a motion for disclosure of documents and information that is in the possession of the Canadian National Railway (\u201cCN\u201d). She argues that these documents and information are needed for her to be able to calculate the outstanding compensation owed to her by CN for lost earnings arising from the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) decision of September 29th, 2010. In this decision, the Tribunal found that CN had discriminated against the Complainant in violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d). More specifically, the Complainant seeks an Order that CN produce information confirming the applicable effective mileage rate for 2007 to 2010 and that it produce the year-end statements of earnings for four (4) employees, which she argues are the appropriate comparators for each years.\n[2] In its decision, the Tribunal, had ordered CN to compensate the Complainant for, inter alia, lost wages and benefits in the following terms:\n[183] The complainant seeks compensation for all wages and benefits lost pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Considering my conclusion as to the date of reinstatement, I order that the Complainant be compensated for all loss of wages and benefits from March 1st, 2007 to today. The parties are ordered to calculate the amount of wages owing using the formula provided for in the Collective Agreement. In regards to extra payments that a road Conductor could receive, since it would be difficult for the Tribunal to set an amount, it is ordered that the parties establish this amount by looking at the extras that were paid for the period to a Conductor with similar seniority working in the terminal, assuming that that Conductor had no unusual absences. The parties could, for example, take into consideration the extra payments that were paid to the employee who was set up in Jasper in March 2006.\n[3] There is a fundamental disagreement between the Complainant and CN regarding the proper methodology that should be used for calculating the amount of lost earnings owed. There is also a fundamental disagreement between the parties as to the appropriate comparators to be used. According to the Complainant, the comparators used by CN are not appropriate because the employee used had unusual absences and different qualifications that directly impacted his earnings. The Complainant\u2019s position is that the comparators offered by CN are not appropriate because they are either qualified as engineers or not qualified as Conductors Locomotive Operators (\u201cCLO\u201d). She submits that, based on a review of the seniority list provided by CN of potential comparators, four (4) other employees are the appropriate comparators because they have similar seniority than her and, to \u201cher knowledge\u201d, they are qualified CLOs. She also submits that none of these employees are qualified as engineers or have had unusual absences during the relevant time.\n[4] CN categorically refutes these allegations. According to CN, the employee closest to the Complainant in terms of seniority, who does not have \u201cunusual absences\u201d, is the employee who is mentioned, as an example, in the Tribunal\u2019s decision. CN states that this employee is the appropriate comparator and that when he was absent from work, the next employee on the seniority list was used. It argues that the comparison CN used was \u201cmore advantageous\u201d to the Complainant. CN further submits that the employee it used as a comparator had no \u201cunusual absences\u201d.\nI. ISSUE [5] The issue in this motion is whether the Tribunal ought to order disclosure of the information and documentation sought by the Complainant.\nII. DECISION [6] The standard for disclosure of documents is arguable relevance to the issues in the proceeding. In other words, the Complainant must establish that there is a nexus between the information or documents sought and the issues in dispute: Guay v Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 42. The arguable relevance of material must be determined on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the issues raised in each case: Warman v Bahr, 2006 CHRT, 18, at para. 9. Furthermore, the Tribunal has made it clear that a request for disclosure \u201cmust not be speculative or amount to a \u2018fishing expedition\u2019\u201d : Guay v Canada, supra, at para. 43.\n[7] In the instant case, although the information sought might at first glance seem relevant, I do not believe that the order sought should be granted. Having read the parties\u2019 arguments on this motion, it is obvious that the motion for production of documents is nothing more than a side issue to the main question. What is at stake in this motion is the issue on its merit. In their briefs, both parties have argued facts which go to the merits of the case without any supporting affidavits and without either party having had the opportunity to cross-examine the other party\u2019s witnesses on their evidence.\n[8] I see no reason at this time to order the disclosure sought by the Complainant. The matter should proceed before the Tribunal on its merits. CN will then have the onus of establishing that the methodology used for calculating the amount of lost earnings owed to the Complainant is appropriate and respects the Order made by the Tribunal. The Complainant will have full opportunity to discredit CN\u2019s approach either by bringing forward its own evidence or by cross-examining CN\u2019s witnesses. Should the Complainant succeed in establishing that CN did not use the appropriate methodology, it would then be up to the Tribunal, in accordance with the evidence, to make the appropriate order directing how the parties should approach the matter.\n[9] It is abundantly clear from reading the parties\u2019 submissions that they have a fundamental disagreement on the material facts surrounding the issue before the Tribunal. It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal, on a preliminary motion for disclosure of documents, without having had the opportunity to hear the evidence, to come to a conclusion that would have an impact on the merits of the issue.\n[10] For these reasons, the motion for disclosure of information and documents is, at this time, denied.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 18, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1355\/8508\nStyle of Cause: Denise Seeley v.

Motion to Amend the Complaints. 1\nA......... Alleged retaliatory conduct by other Union members. 2\nB......... Alleged retaliatory conduct by Mr. Willicome. 4\nC......... Analysis. 6\nII........... Motion to Modify Disclosure Ruling. 10\n[1] The Complainant, Ms. Leslie Palm, claims the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 (the Union) has discriminated and harassed her on the basis of her sex, pursuant to sections 9, 10 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. The Complainant also claims that Mr. Cliff Willicome and Mr. Richard Wilkinson have harassed her on the basis of her sex in contravention of section 14 of the Act (the Union, Mr. Willicome and Mr. Wilkinson are herein collectively referred to as the Respondents).\n[2] Among other things, the Complainant alleges the Union creates and fosters a work environment that is hostile to females and in which work is allocated to males and females in a discriminatory manner.\n[3] The following ruling deals with the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend her complaints to add allegations of retaliation, pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act. This section provides:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[4] For its part, the Respondent has also made a motion to modify a ruling made by the Tribunal regarding the disclosure of the Complainant\u2019s medical records.\n[5] Each motion will be dealt with in turn.\nI. Motion to Amend the Complaints [6] In a motion dated December 19, 2012, the Complainant alleges the Union has retaliated against her for having filed her complaint. In a further letter on March 30, 2013, the Complainant provided further particulars regarding claims of \u201cfurther and ongoing retaliation\u201d by the Union.\n[7] The Complainant alleges the Union and Mr. Willicome have retaliated against her for having filed her complaints against them. The allegations against the Union stem from the actions of other Union members and, specifically, Mr. Tony Pantusa. The allegations against Mr. Willicome revolve around an incident with the Complainant\u2019s son, Mr. Chris Cornett.\n[8] Although the Respondents view the December 19, 2012 and March 30, 2013 correspondence from the Complainant as two separate motions to amend, the latter correspondence only provides an update as to the situation with Mr. Pantusa. In the March 30, 2013 correspondence, the Complainant does not seek to add additional grounds or discriminatory practices to her complaints, just facts. Ultimately, the Respondents have had an opportunity to provide submissions on both pieces of correspondence and, if the motion to amend is granted, the Respondents will be able to address all these facts through the filing of amended Statements of Particulars. Therefore, I will address the Complainant\u2019s December 19, 2012 and March 30, 2013 correspondence together, as her motion to amend her complaint.\n[9] The Complainant also provided additional submissions and documentation on July 15, 2013, regarding her motion to amend her complaints. However, I did not consider that correspondence in ruling on the present motion. As described by the Complainant in her July 15, 2013 correspondence, those submissions go to the merits of substantiating her allegations of retaliation: \u201cThe findings of the attached prove as I have stated that I have been continually subjected to ongoing retaliation and harassment to which my Union has been aware of and done nothing to stop\u201d. As will be described in more detail below, these submissions are irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether the complaints should be amended, as the Tribunal is not embarking on a substantive review of the merits of the Complainant\u2019s allegations. Should the amendment be granted, the Complainant can include her July 15, 2013 submissions and documentation as part of her amended Statement of Particulars.\nA. Alleged retaliatory conduct by other Union members [10] Since the filling of her complaint, the Complainant alleges there have been many incidents of remarks, lewd comments and various verbal attacks made against her by other Union members regarding the filing of her complaint. Specifically, the Complainant described an incident where a newspaper article describing her complaint had been posted in the workplace and on which employees wrote comments that she found offensive.\n[11] In another incident, on July 30, 2009, the Complainant claims six co-workers were hostile and aggressive towards her, yelling at her about having filed her complaint. The Complainant felt intimidated by the incident and feared for her safety. Although the incident was reported to the Union, she claims nothing was ever done about the incident.\n[12] Most of the Complainant\u2019s retaliation allegations stem from her interactions with Mr. Tony Pantusa, a former Union Executive Officer and Dispatch Coordinator at the Complainant\u2019s workplace.\n[13] According to the Complainant, Mr. Pantusa has been aware of her complaint against the Union since at least December 2009. At that time, she claims she and Mr. Pantusa had a conflict regarding an incident with her son. During that conflict, she claims Mr. Pantusa criticized her, in front of other co-workers, for having brought a complaint against the Union. The Complainant submits that this incident was humiliating and emotionally stressful for her and, in her view, the criticism was intended to prevent her from continuing with her complaint. She claims the incident was witnessed by the Union\u2019s Business Agent on duty in the workplace that evening.\n[14] The Complainant also alleges, on May 19, 2012, following a discussion regarding the dispatch of work in the workplace, Mr. Pantusa said to the Complainant that he was not afraid of her and stated several times that she was a \u201crat\u201d. In the Complaint\u2019s view, these comments were directed at the fact she had filed a complaint against the Union. Subsequently, the Complainant claims Mr. Pantusa refused to dispatch her for work that evening. Although she brought up the incident with the Union\u2019s Business Agent who was present in the workplace at the time, she claims he did not attempt to prevent Mr. Pantusa\u2019s conduct.\n[15] Following the May 19, 2012 incident, the Complainant alleges Mr. Pantusa started making inquiries of other Union members to get some \u201cdirt\u201d on her, and even contacted her ex-spouse in this regard. The Complainant also claims Mr. Pantusa began spreading false rumours about her regarding sexual conduct in the workplace.\n[16] The Union hired an independent investigator to investigate the Complainant\u2019s allegations against Mr. Pantusa and prepare a report. In October 2012, the investigator found that Mr. Pantusa had retaliated against the Complainant. It was recommended that the Union discipline Mr. Pantusa and compensate the Complainant for the one day of work she missed. The Union disciplined Mr. Pantusa by making him ineligible for Union office for a period of two years and paid the Complainant her day\u2019s wages.\n[17] On November 6, 2012, Mr. Pantusa filed an appeal with the Union and was heard by the membership at a Union meeting held on February 20, 2013. In preparation for his appeal, the Complainant claims Mr. Pantusa distributed documents in the workplace relating to her without her consent and campaigned in the workplace, naming her personally.\n[18] In the week following the Union\u2019s meeting, the Complainant claims the atmosphere at the dispatch hall intensified, which lead to several unwelcome encounters with co-workers. According to the Complainant, one of these incidents resulted in her having to be dispatched for work from home, rather than from the dispatch hall, for approximately 4 weeks. In another incident, she claims to have been approached by a co-worker regarding a rumour that she had been involved in sexual conduct in the workplace.\n[19] According to the Complainant, the alleged retaliatory actions of the Union members occurred with either the direct or implied consent of the Union; or, the Union was aware or ought to have been aware of the incidents, but turned a blind eye or acquiesced in the retaliatory conduct of others acting on the Union\u2019s behalf.\nB. Alleged retaliatory conduct by Mr. Willicome [20] The Complainant\u2019s son, Mr. Chris Cornett, also works for Western Stevedoring Ltd. The Complainant describes her son\u2019s status with the Union as a \u201cwelfare paying casual\u201d, without the full rights of Union membership. On March 29, 2012, he had a dispute with Mr. Willicome, a named Respondent in this complaint, regarding his availability to be dispatched for work. Mr. Willicome was the Dispatch Coordinator that day and, according to the Complainant, did not make her son available for shifts he should have been. An altercation ensued in which the Complainant claims her son was shoved by Mr. Willicome.\n[21] Following the altercation, Mr. Cornett was suspended and Mr. Willicome remained working pending investigation. According to the Complainant, her son was only made aware of his suspension when he arrived at work the next day, and never received written notice of his suspension, nor of its length.\n[22] Following Western Stevedoring Ltd.\u2019s (the Employer) investigation of the incident, both Mr. Cornett and Mr. Willicome received suspensions. Mr. Cornett received a 15 day suspension, but had already been off work for 35 days pending the investigation. The Complainant claims her son did not receive any financial compensation for the extra 20 days he was suspended, and adds that the Union appealed Mr. Willicome\u2019s suspension.\n[23] Following this incident, in early June 2012, the Complainant claims Mr. Willicome initiated a process to charge her son with \u2018conduct detrimental to the welfare of the Union\u2019. The basis of the charge was for filling a false complaint of assault with the Vancouver Police Department regarding the March 29, 2012 altercation. According to the Complainant, the Union proceeded with the charge against her son without ever seeing a copy of the alleged false complaint, without investigating or interviewing her son, and based solely on Mr. Willicome\u2019s allegations. Mr. Cornett was eventually found guilty of \u2018conduct detrimental to the welfare of the Union\u2019.\n[24] In the Complainant\u2019s view, Mr. Willicome\u2019s refusal to make her son available for shifts and charging him with \u2018conduct detrimental to the welfare of the Union\u2019 were done in retaliation against her for bringing a complaint against the Union and Mr. Willicome. She submits that the March 2012 incident with her son was the first opportunity Mr. Willicome had to retaliate against her since being elected an Executive Officer of the Union and Dispatch Coordinator, and he used that position of authority to personally target her through her son. The Complainant adds that the Union\u2019s actions in supporting the \u2018conduct detrimental to the welfare of the Union\u2019 charges and in suspending her son for 35 days are in retaliation for the filing of her complaint.\nC. Analysis [25] The Tribunal has the authority to amend complaints \u201c...for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d (Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, [1994] 1 FC 3 (FCA); cited in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at para. 30 [Parent]). In determining whether to allow an amendment, the Tribunal does not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the proposed amendment. Rather, as a general rule, an amendment is granted unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations in the amendment sought could not possibly succeed (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 at para. 6; and, Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 at para. 7 [Virk]).\n[26] That said, an amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint, as this would bypass the referral process mandated by the Act (see Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at paras. 7-9; and, Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 45929 (CHRT) at para. 11). The proposed amendment must be linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint (see Virk at para. 7; and, Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 at paras. 17-18).\n[27] Furthermore, the issue of prejudice must be considered when an amendment is proposed. An amendment cannot be granted \u201c...if it results in a prejudice to the other party\u201d (Parent at para 40).\n[28] According to the Respondents, the Complainant makes sweeping and non-specific allegations of retaliation against the Union and Mr. Willicome, which are not linked to her complaint and do not disclose a tenable claim of retaliation. In this regard, the Respondents note that, while the Complainant seeks to amend all three of her complaints, she makes no allegations of retaliation against Mr. Wilkinson.\n[29] I agree with the Respondents that no allegations of retaliation have been made against Mr. Wilkinson. Accordingly, there is no basis upon which to amend the complaint against him. The Complainant\u2019s allegations of retaliation are directed solely at the Union and Mr. Willicome.\n[30] With regard to the complaint against the Union, the Respondents argue that retaliation is limited to the behaviour of \u201ca person acting on [a respondent\u2019s] behalf\u201d, as per the wording of section 14.1 of the Act. The Respondents submit that any alleged retaliatory conduct was neither directed nor condoned by the Union, nor was it within the Union\u2019s authority to do so. According to the Respondents, the Union is not responsible for employees\u2019 behaviour at the worksite: the employer is responsible. The Union adds, it has no knowledge of the conduct allegedly engaged in by Mr. Pantusa, and any such conduct has no relation to Union business. In any event, the Respondent submits the allegations against Mr. Pantusa are now moot as the Union has already investigated the retaliatory conduct, disciplined Mr. Pantusa and compensated the Complainant.\n[31] The fact the Union says it did not direct or condone the behaviour is irrelevant at this stage, as the Tribunal is not embarking on a substantive review of the merits of the proposed amendment. Nor is it relevant for the Union to assert that it is not responsible for employees\u2019 behaviour at the worksite. Whether the conduct occurred at the worksite or off the worksite, the question raised by the Complainant\u2019s allegations under section 14.1 of the Act is whether other union members retaliated against the Complainant on behalf of the Union. She claims they did. If the amendment is allowed, evidence will have to be brought forward to establish this allegation and the Union will be given an opportunity to dispute that evidence.\n[32] With regard to the allegations involving Mr. Pantusa, again, the fact the Union claims it has no knowledge of his alleged conduct, or that his conduct was not related to Union business, is irrelevant at this stage given the Tribunal is not embarking on a substantive review of the merits of the proposed amendment. As mentioned above, the Complainant claims Mr. Pantusa was acting on the Union\u2019s behalf and, if the amendment is allowed, evidence will have to be brought forward to establish this allegation. In response to such allegations, the Union will be given a full and ample opportunity to raise arguments in defence of the allegations. Furthermore, there is nothing in the Act or otherwise that prohibits the Complainant from raising allegations of retaliation before the Tribunal despite the fact the Union has investigated and disciplined Mr. Pantusa for his actions.\n[33] While the Respondents claim the allegations of retaliation against the Union are sweeping and non-specific, the Complainant has provided a factual outline of the events giving rise to her allegations of retaliation and has brought forward documentation to support those allegations. The events giving rise to her allegations of retaliation all occurred following the filing of her complaint against the Union and she believes the alleged retaliatory conduct to be linked to the filing of that complaint. I also note the Respondents did not raise any issues of prejudice with regard to amending the complaint against the Union. On this basis, the Complainant has presented a tenable claim of retaliation and, having addressed the Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard, it is not plain and obvious the allegations could not possibly succeed.\n[34] As for the complaint against Mr. Willicome, the Respondents argue that actions can only be retaliatory under the Act when they are directed at a person who has filed a human rights complaint, as per the wording of section 14.1 of the Act. In this regard, the Respondents argue that the allegations against Mr. Willicome concern an interaction between him and the Complainant\u2019s son, Mr. Cornett, who is not a human rights complainant. The Union adds, Mr. Willicome did not know who Mr. Cornett was during the incident. Furthermore, despite filing a harassment complaint with the employer regarding Mr. Willicome\u2019s actions, the Union notes that Mr. Cornett\u2019s complaint did not link the incident with Mr. Willicome to the Complainant\u2019s human rights complaint.\n[35] While the allegations of retaliation against Mr. Willicome concern an interaction between him and the Complainant\u2019s son, it does not preclude the Complainant from claiming she was targeted for retaliation and victimized by those same actions as well. Individuals may suffer discrimination as a result of actions directed at third parties (see McKenna v. Secretary of State, 1993 CanLII 308 (CHRT) at p. 18). Furthermore, in given circumstances, there may be more than one victim (Canada (Secretary of State for External Affairs) v. Menghani, [1994] 2 FC 10 at para. 39-40). The question as to who is the \u201cvictim\u201d of an alleged discriminatory practice is almost wholly one of fact: are the consequence of the discriminatory practice sufficiently direct and immediate to justify qualifying the individual as a \u201cvictim\u201d (see Singh (Re), [1989] 1 FC 430 (FCA) at para. 22). If the amendment is allowed, this question will have to be examined as part of the merits of the Complainant\u2019s allegations of retaliation.\n[36] The Union\u2019s submissions regarding the fact that Mr. Willicome did not know who Mr. Cornett was during the incident and that Mr. Cornett did not link the incident with the Complainant\u2019s human rights complaint as part of his own harassment complaint can also be raised when examining the merits of the allegations. However, for the purposes of determining this motion, they are irrelevant.\n[37] Again, the allegations of retaliation against Mr. Willicome relate to a specific event to which the Complainant has provided detailed facts and supporting documentation. Her allegations of retaliation are against the same respondent as in her initial complaint; the event giving rise to the allegation of retaliation occurred following the filing of that initial complaint; and, the Complainant believes the alleged retaliatory conduct to be linked to the filing of that complaint. I also note the Respondents did not raise any issues of prejudice with regard to amending the complaint against Mr. Willicome. On this basis, the Complainant has presented a tenable claim of retaliation and, having addressed the Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard, it is not plain and obvious the allegations could not possibly succeed.\n[38] As a result, the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend her complaints is granted. The complaints against the Union and Mr. Willicome are amended to include allegations of retaliation pursuant to section 14.1 of Act. The parties will be given an opportunity to file amended Statements of Particulars pursuant to the following schedule:\nAugust 15, 2013: Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars and Disclosure\nSeptember 5, 2013: Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars and Disclosure\nSeptember 12, 2013: Complainant\u2019s Reply, if any\n[39] In filing amended Statements of Particulars, the parties are reminded of their obligations under Rule 6 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) and, specifically, ongoing disclosure and production pursuant to Rule 6(5).\nII. Motion to Modify Disclosure Ruling [40] In a previous ruling in this matter, the Complainant was ordered to produce certain medical records to the Respondents (see Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 et al., 2013 CHRT 1 [Palm]). However, to protect the confidentiality of those medical records, the Tribunal directed as follows:\nthe documents shall be disclosed to the Complainant and counsel for the Respondents only and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal. The documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry and the documents must be returned to the respective doctor who disclosed them at the conclusion of the inquiry.\n(Palm at para. 13)\n[41] By way of motion dated May 3, 2013, the Respondents sought an order that counsel for the Respondents may allow the President of the Union, Mr. Willicome and Mr. Wilkinson to view the disclosed medical records to the extent required by counsel to obtain informed instructions and provide advice.\n[42] According to the Respondents, the current restrictions on disclosed documents prevent counsel from obtaining informed instructions from the Respondents and are, therefore, now prejudicial and unreasonable. Without permission from the Tribunal allowing counsel to obtain informed instructions, the Respondents claim they are unable to fully and meaningfully defend themselves from the claims against them.\n[43] The Complainant is concerned that the disclosure of her medical records to the Respondents will result in that information being divulged in the workplace. She claims her medical records contain not only information about her, but also about family, friends and co-workers. She notes the President of the Union, Mr. Willicome and Mr. Wilkinson are her fellow co-workers and hold positions of authority over her in the workplace. Furthermore, she notes that following the previous disclosure of a settlement agreement between her and her employer in this matter (see Palm v. International longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, 2011 CHRT 12), within two weeks, there were rumours and statements being made in the workplace with regard to its contents; the Complainant\u2019s finances; and, her complaint. Therefore, the Complainant argues the disclosure ruling should not be altered.\n[44] The Tribunal has recognized that a complainant has a right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to his or her medical records and, as was done in this case, has put procedures in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of that information in appropriate circumstances (see Beaudry v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 CanLII 61851 (CHRT) at para. 7; and, McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 38296 (CHRT) at para. 3). However, in protecting the privacy interests of a complainant, the Tribunal must still ensure that all parties have a full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations (see subsection 50(1) of the Act). In other words, the Tribunal must balance the privacy interests of the Complainant in her medical records with the Respondents\u2019 right to present their case (see for example, M. (A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 SCR 157 at para. 36; and, British Columbia v. British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union, 2005 BCCA 14).\n[45] In this case, to allow the Respondents the full and ample opportunity to present their case, their counsel requests permission to allow her clients to view the Complainant\u2019s medical records to the extent required to obtain informed instructions and provide advice. While the Complainant has concerns about this disclosure, I believe the interests of both parties can be balanced by allowing the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records to be viewed under the following conditions:\n(1) To the extent required to obtain informed instructions and provide advice, counsel for the Respondents may allow the President of the Union, Mr. Willicome and Mr. Wilkinson to view the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records.\n(2) Counsel for the Respondents shall not provide a copy or any sort of reproduction of the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records to the individuals named in paragraph 1 or allow those individuals to make a copy or any sort of reproduction of the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records.\n(3) Prior to counsel for the Respondents allowing the individuals named in paragraph 1 to view the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records, she is to receive a written undertaking from each of the three individuals that they will not (a) discuss the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records with anyone besides their counsel or (b) in any way disseminate the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records or any of its contents to anyone.\n(4) A copy of each of the undertakings set out in paragraph 3 shall be provided to the Tribunal and the Complainant.\n[46] The previous directions of the Tribunal regarding the confidentiality of the Complainant\u2019s medical records, found at the paragraph 13 of Palm above, will continue to apply. If further directions are required concerning the Complainant\u2019s disclosed medical records, any of the parties may make a request to the Tribunal for such directions.\nSigned by\nSusheel Gupta\nTribunal Vice-Chairperson\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 25, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1625\/17110, T1626\/17210, T1627\/17310\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Palm v.

Complaint & Motions [1] On July 29, 2011, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Norman Murray (the Complainant) against the Immigration and Refugee Board (the IRB or the Respondent).\n[2] On April 10, 2012, the Commission brought a motion for an order of production by the Respondent of certain documents.\n[3] On April 24, 2012, the Complainant also brought a motion for an order of production by the Respondent of certain documents.\n[4] On June 4, 2012, the Respondent brought a motion for an order dismissing the complaint. In the alternative, the Respondent requests an order defining the scope of the complaint including in particular, the issues to be determined, the groups or classifications to be considered, the specific time periods to be covered and the remedies that may be ordered.\n[5] The following ruling deals with all three motions.\nII. Background A. The Human Rights Complaint [6] On April 22, 2004, the Complainant filed a human rights complaint with the Commission. The allegations of discrimination arose out of an incident in April 2003 between the Complainant, a black male, and several white co-workers, who allegedly made racist comments about another black male co-worker. The complaint was initially brought under sections 7 and 14 of the Act, but was later amended to include sections 10 and 12. Among other things, the Complaint Form alleges:\n2. I believe that management at the IRB, has discriminated against me, has imposed adverse differential treatment against me, has incited others to discriminate against me, has created and supported a poisoned work environment that makes it difficult to do my job, to attain career improvement, and has adversely affected my health because of my race. As well, I believe that management at the IRB, has systematically pursued a practices that has effectively deprived me of employment opportunities because of my race.\n[...]\n18. As a union representative and a member of the Employment Equity Committee I have often been critical of the IRB on its practices concerning employment equity, race relations and discrimination. The reason being that the IRB has been is officially recognized as having the largest percentage of visible minority employees in the Federal Public Service (the IRB has used this favourable status when it benefits the organization), yet visible minority employees do not favour well in the IRB as they continue to be clustered at the lowest classification levels. In addition acts of systemic racism, harassment and discriminatory practices, which adversely affects visible minorities, are prevalent throughout the IRB. This has been revealed in public accessible documents the most recent being the Public Service Survey. Management know these problems exist and have not taken the necessary steps to resolve them. I however, had never until then, been faced with this overt form of racism and harassment and wondered if years of neglect by management to address serious issues of racism, discrimination and harassment was the contributing factor.\n[...]\n56. I believe that management has encouraged and supported racism, harassment and discrimination at the IRB. I believe that because of the actions of management, racism, harassment and discriminatory practices have taken roots and have grown radically over this 12-month period. Management\u2019s actions over this period have caused the workplace to be polarized along racial lines, and have poisoned the workplace to the extent where I cannot work effectively. I am presently off on sick leave, because of the level of stress and poison in the workplace as a result of the accumulative racist behaviour of management at the IRB over the 12-month period. As well: my ability to do my job has suffered: my ability to pursue promotional opportunities has suffered: my personal working relationship with my colleagues has suffered and my personal live outside the IRB has suffered tremendously.\n[7] On April 13, 2005, the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(a) of the Act, not to deal with the complaint at that time. As an internal investigation into the complaint by the Respondent was pending, the Commission was of the view that those procedures ought to be exhausted before proceeding. Dealing with the harassment allegations only, the internal investigation concluded the complaint was not founded.\n[8] On July 4, 2005, the Complainant requested the Commission proceed with his human rights complaint.\n[9] Following investigations of the complaint, on August 10, 2007, the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the Act, not to deal with the Complainant\u2019s allegations of harassment. However, the Commission also decided, pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the Act, to deal with the portion of the complaint that was not dealt with through the Respondent\u2019s internal investigation. Specifically, in a letter dated September 19, 2007 to the Respondent, the Commission stated it would be dealing with the allegations that the Respondent incited others to discriminate against the Complainant and deprived him and other visible minorities permanent employment advancements because of race.\n[10] Prior to the Commission\u2019s decision, the Respondent had requested the Commission not deal with the complaint on the basis that it would cause a duplication of proceedings. In 2007, the Complainant and others also initiated complaints against the IRB under the Public Service Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2 [the PSLRA], and the Public Service Employment Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, ss. 12, 13 [the PSEA], which are described in more detail below. Despite the Respondent\u2019s request, the Commission proceeded with the investigation of the Complainant\u2019s human rights complaint. The Respondent did not raise this issue again prior to these proceedings.\n[11] Following another investigation, on October 20, 2008, the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(b) of the Act, to dismiss the complaint. Based on the evidence gathered during the investigation, the Commission concluded the Respondent had not failed to provide the Complainant with a harassment-free workplace; and, the Respondent did not pursue a policy, rule, practice or standard which deprives the Complainant and other visible minorities of permanent employment advancements due to their race and colour.\n[12] An application for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s October 20, 2008 decision was brought before the Federal Court. On August 18, 2009, on the consent of the parties, the application for judicial review was allowed in part by Justice Hansen. The Federal Court quashed the Commission\u2019s decision in so far as it related to the allegations of systemic discrimination and remitted the matter of systemic discrimination back to the Commission for a supplemental investigation. Specifically, the Federal Court ordered the Commission to examine the situation of visible minorities at the Respondent\u2019s Toronto Regional Office during the period of 12 months preceding the filing of the complaint with specific reference to: (a) clustering of visible minorities in lower status positions; and, (b) underrepresentation of visible minorities in permanent positions. Needless to say, having consented to the Federal Court\u2019s order, it was not appealed by any party. Nor was the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction under the Act to deal with the issues directed by the Court questioned or alleged to be in conflict with any other legislation, by any party at any time prior to these proceedings, other than as described in paragraph 10 above.\n[13] After a supplementary investigation into the complaint, the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Act, to request that the Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint. In a letter to the Respondent, dated July 29, 2011, the Commission explained that it requested an inquiry because:\n\u2022 the evidence gathered indicates that from March 1, 2003 to March 17, 2004, visible minorities within the IRB\u2019s Toronto regional office, appear to be clustered in lower level positions in the PM, AS and CR categories;\n\u2022 The evidence gathered shows that visible minorities within the IRB\u2019s Toronto regional office, when provided acting opportunities, were provided the acting opportunities mainly within the lower categories;\n\u2022 The evidence gathered also shows that within the IRB\u2019s Toronto regional office, that a barrier may exist that prohibits PM-01s from advancing with the IRB; and,\n\u2022 The evidence gathered shows that within the IRB\u2019s Toronto regional office, visible minorities appear to be under-represented within the higher levels such as the PM-05 and PM-06 levels.\n[14] In its letter to the Tribunal, also dated July 29, 2011, the Commission wrote:\nI am writing to inform you that the Canadian Human Rights Commission has reviewed the complaint (20040576) of Norm Murray against Immigration and Refugee Board.\nThe Commission has decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the complaint as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\nA copy of the complaint form is enclosed. Form 1, including complainant and respondent information, will be provided by the Litigation Services Division.\nThe complainant and respondent are being advised that they will receive further information from the Tribunal regarding the proceedings.\nThis letter did not, on its face, place any limitations on the inquiry vis-a-vis the issues raised in the complaint.\n[15] The Respondent did not seek judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to request an inquiry into the complaint.\n[16] At the outset of the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings, the parties agreed to attempt to mediate the complaint. In a letter dated October 4, 2011, the Tribunal informed the parties that mediation was scheduled for December 6, 2011, with mediation briefs due November 15, 2011. In that same letter, the Tribunal set out a schedule for disclosure in the event mediation did not result in a settlement.\n[17] On December 2, 2011, after reviewing the file, the Tribunal Member appointed to mediate the matter decided to postpone mediation and instructed the parties to proceed with disclosure. A conference call was scheduled for December 6, 2011 to clarify next steps and to address any disclosure or other preliminary issues. That call was subsequently postponed.\n[18] On December 19, 2011, the Commission sent a letter to the Respondent requesting the production of certain documents.\n[19] On January 10, 2012, the Commission wrote to the Tribunal to request an update regarding the complaint. As the Commission\u2019s disclosure package was due January 17, 2012, and given the mediation and conference call were postponed, the Commission requested the disclosure timelines be halted until the parties were able to discuss the matter at a conference call. In response, the Tribunal indicated, as mediation had been postponed, the disclosure schedule was no longer applicable. The parties were asked to provide their availabilities for an upcoming conference call.\n[20] A conference call with the parties was held on January 23, 2012, where the parties and the Tribunal agreed to proceed with mediation.\n[21] The mediation occurred on February 28, 2012, but did not result in a settlement. The Tribunal held a case management conference call with the parties on the same date. During this conference call, the Commission indicated it had not received a response to its letter to the Respondent, dated December 19, 2011, requesting production of certain documents. Also during the call, the Complainant requested the production of certain documents from the Respondent. The Tribunal asked the Respondent to provide a response to the Complainant and the Commission\u2019s request for production of documents by March 7, 2012.\n[22] The Respondent responded to the Commission and Complainant\u2019s request for documents on March 7, 2012. Among other things, the Respondent was of the view that the request for documents was premature, given statements of particulars had not been exchanged yet, and that certain of the documents requested could not be disclosed pursuant to the Employment Equity Act, S.C. 1995, c. 44 [the EEA].\n[23] The Complainant and the Commission decided to file motions to seek the production of the documents they previously requested. In response, the Respondent indicated it would be bringing a motion dealing with the scope of the complaint and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Therefore, a timetable for written submissions on all three motions was established. The written submissions for all three motions were due to be completed by July 23, 2012.\n[24] The Tribunal held a further case management conference call on July 18, 2012. During this conference call, the Tribunal decided it would hear oral submissions from the parties on the motions. A hearing was scheduled for October 15-16, 2012, in Ottawa.\n[25] Beginning with the Respondent\u2019s motion, the Tribunal heard oral submissions from the parties on October 15-16, 2012 in Ottawa, on all three motions. The hearing concluded on October 17, 2012, by teleconference.\nB. The PSLRA Complaint [26] On February 27, 2007, the Complainant and seven others brought a group grievance against the Respondent under section 215 of the PSLRA. Among other things, the group grieves the past and present actions, policies and practices of IRB management that discriminate adversely, deny employment opportunities and benefits, and create and promote employment barriers against visible minority Case Officers who work in the Immigrations Appeal Division in the Toronto region of the IRB. Given the grievance involved issues under the Act, the Commission was notified of the grievance.\n[27] The Public Service Labour Relations Board (the PSLRB) was scheduled to hear the Complainant\u2019s group grievance on September 27 and 28, 2012. The Commission did not participate in the proceedings.\nC. The PSEA Complaint [28] On March 21, 2007, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Public Service Staffing Tribunal (the PSST) pursuant to section 77 of the PSEA. The PSST complaint alleged the IRB\u2019s choice to use a non-advertised appointment process to staff new PM-05 positions discriminated against the Complainant on the basis of his race. The Complainant alleged the non-advertised process constituted systemic discrimination where job barriers result in a clustering of visible minorities in Case Officer positions at the PM-01 group and level.\n[29] On December 21, 2009, the PSST dismissed the Complainant\u2019s PSEA complaint (Murray v. Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board, 2009 PSST 33 [Murray]). The PSST determined the Complainant had not established a prima facie case of discrimination. Even if he had, the PSST found the IRB had met its evidentiary burden of establishing a reasonable non-discriminatory explanation for choosing between an advertised and a non-advertised appointment process. An application for judicial review of the PSST decision was brought before the Federal Court.\n[30] On May 11, 2011, the Federal Court allowed the Complainant\u2019s application for judicial review of the PSST decision (Murray v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FC 542). The Federal Court found the Complainant\u2019s right to procedural fairness was breached by the PSST when it did not consider the Complainant\u2019s request to submit post-hearing evidence. The Federal Court ordered the PSST to consider the relevance of the evidence and whether it would accept it and, if so, its impact on the merits of the complaint.\n[31] On November 30, 2011, the PSST denied the Complainant\u2019s request to submit post-hearing evidence (Murray v. Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 2011 PSST 36). The PSST dismissed the complaint as per its reasons dated December 21, 2009. An application for judicial review of the PSST\u2019s 2011 decision is currently pending before the Federal Court (Court Number T-372-12).\nIII. Issues [32] The Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint raises the following issues for the Tribunal to address:\nA. On what basis can the Tribunal dismiss a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits?\nB. Does paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider the complaint?\nC. Does subsection 54.1(2) of the Act limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider the complaint?\nD. Is there reason to dismiss the complaint based on the principles of issue estoppel or abuse of process?\nE. In the alternative, if the complaint is not dismissed for any reason above, is there reason to limit the scope of the inquiry?\n[33] If the complaint is not dismissed in addressing the issues above, then the Tribunal will address the following issues raised in the Complainant and Commission\u2019s motions for production of documents:\nF. Does the EEA limit the Tribunal\u2019s power to order the production of documents?\nG. Are the motions for production of documents premature?\nH. Should the Respondent produce the documents requested by the Complainant?\nI. Should the Respondent produce the documents requested by the Commission?\nIV. Analysis A. On what basis can the Tribunal dismiss a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits? [34] According to the Respondent, pursuant to sections 48.9 and 50 of the Act, the Tribunal has broad discretion to dismiss complaints on a preliminary motion. The Respondent submits the questions raised in the motion to dismiss are not concerned with whether the Commission erred, but whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the substance of the complaint, and whether it would be an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process to proceed with a full inquiry. The Respondent adds, bringing these concerns to the attention of the Tribunal in a preliminary motion is the proper and most efficient way to have these concerns addressed.\n[35] While the Complainant and the Commission agree that the Tribunal has the power to dismiss a complainant on a preliminary motion, they are of the view that the power should be exercised cautiously. According to the Commission, this complaint is not the type of complaint the Tribunal should dismiss on a preliminary basis, as it involves a complex set of facts and raises important issues of law, including substantial public interest issues. The Commission points out the parties have not filed their statement of particulars, nor provided any evidence which will assist the Tribunal in determining the substantial legal and factual issues raised in this complaint. The Complainant adds, the Tribunal cannot deal with issues concerning the Commission\u2019s investigation that should have been raised by judicial review before the Court.\n[36] The Federal Court recently examined the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss complaints prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits: Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 [First Nations Child and Family Caring Society]. According to the Federal Court, nothing in the Act or the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure precludes the bringing of a motion to have the Tribunal determine a substantive issue in advance of a full hearing of the complaint on its merits. Nor is there anything in the Act or the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure that would preclude the Tribunal from deciding such a motion. However, pursuant to sections 48.9 and 50 of the Act, in hearing and deciding the motion the process must be fair, and the rules of natural justice respected, with a full and ample opportunity for the parties to adduce the evidence necessary to decide the issues raised by the motion (see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society at paras. 131-132).\n[37] However, in entertaining motions of this nature, the Tribunal must respect the separate roles of the Commission and the Tribunal. Under the scheme of the Act, the Commission is the body who accepts, manages and processes complaints of discriminatory practices. Pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Act, the Commission may request the Tribunal institute an inquiry into a complaint if it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted. The Commission\u2019s decision to refer is not a determination that the complaint is well founded or even within the purview of the Act. Nor is it for the Tribunal to question whether the Commission has reasonably concluded an inquiry is warranted. That is the role of the Federal Court on judicial review (see Deborah P. Labelle v. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 CHRT 4 at para. 71; International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), Local 400 v. Oster, [2002] 2 FC 430 at paras. 29-30; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Warman, 2012 FC 1162 at paras. 55-57; and, Halifax (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission), 2012 SCC 10 at paras. 23, 27, and 33). The Tribunal\u2019s role is to inquire into the complaint (see subsections 49(2) and 50(1) of the Act). In conducting an inquiry that is de novo from the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the complaint, the Tribunal is master of its own procedure and can determine how best to deal with the issues which have been referred to it, including dismissing the complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits (see Prassad v. Canada (Minister of employment and immigration), [1989] 1 SCR 560 at para. 16; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 at para. 14, aff\u2019d 2004 FCA 363 [Canada Post]).\n[38] That said, the Tribunal exercises its power to dismiss a human rights complaint in advance of a full hearing on the merits cautiously, and then only in the clearest of cases (see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society at para. 140; and, Buffett v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 16 at para. 39). While there may be cases where a full hearing involving viva voce evidence is not necessarily required; in other cases, where the issues of fact and law are complex and intermingled, it may well be more efficient to await the full hearing before ruling on the preliminary issue (see First Nations Child and Family Caring Society at paras. 141-144). In every case, \u201cthe Tribunal will have to consider the facts and issues raised by the complaint before it, and will have to identify the appropriate procedure to be followed so as to secure as informal and expeditious a hearing process as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society at para. 148).\n[39] It is with this understanding of the Tribunal\u2019s power to dismiss a complaint prior to conducting a full hearing on the merits that I will examine the issues raised by the Respondent in its motion to dismiss.\nB. Does paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider the complaint? [40] According to the Respondent, in 1995, Parliament made amendments to the EEA and at the same time, made consequential amendments to the Act. Those consequential amendments removed the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over complaints concerning the underrepresentation of designated groups. In the Respondent\u2019s view, this ensures that the cooperative and collaborative approach to achieving employment equity that is central to the scheme of the EEA is not put at risk by third party complaints brought before the Tribunal. In particular, the Respondent points to section 40.1 of the Act, which it says precludes complaints based solely on statistical information that purport to show that members of a designated group are underrepresented in the employer\u2019s workforce. The Respondent submits it is evident from the Complaint Form, the Commission\u2019s Investigation Reports, Justice Hansen\u2019s order and the Commission\u2019s decisions of October 20, 2008 and July 29, 2011, that the portions of the complaint referred to the Tribunal focus entirely on allegations that there was clustering of visible minorities at lower levels and underrepresentation of visible minorities at higher levels of certain classifications within the Toronto Regional Office of the IRB during the twelve month period prior to the filing of the complaint. The complaint does not identify a practice or policy of the Respondent that is alleged to cause discrimination contrary to section 10 of the Act. According to the Respondent, as the complaint is based solely on statistical information that purports to show that members of a designated group are underrepresented in the employer\u2019s workforce, it is not a proper complaint under the Act pursuant to section 40.1 and, therefore, is beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n[41] The Complainant submits a complaint based on statistical information and other evidence is entirely permissible. According to the Complainant, that is precisely the nature of the complaint here, which is also supported by a variety of other circumstantial and direct evidence.\n[42] According to the Commission, section 40.1 of the Act applies exclusively to the Commission and not to the Tribunal. The Commission submits the Respondent\u2019s arguments fail to consider the separate roles of the Commission and the Tribunal under the Act and is an implicit attack of the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. If the Respondent disagreed with the Commission\u2019s decision, it had the opportunity to seek judicial review before the appropriate forum: the Federal Court. However, it chose not to do so.\n[43] Subsection 40.1(2) of the Act provides:\nEmployment equity complaints\n(2) No complaint may be dealt with by the Commission pursuant to section 40 where\n(a) the complaint is made against an employer alleging that the employer has engaged in a discriminatory practice set out in section 7 or paragraph 10(a); and\n(b) the complaint is based solely on statistical information that purports to show that members of one or more designated groups are underrepresented in the employer\u2019s workforce.\n[44] Given the clear language of subsection 40.1(2), the Tribunal does not dispute the Respondent\u2019s assertion that section 7 and 10(a) complaints, based solely on statistical information that purport to show the underrepresentation of designated groups, are not to be dealt with by the Commission as a complaint under the Act. Similarly, subsection 40(3.1) of the Act precludes the Commission from initiating a complaint as a result of information obtained in the course of the administration of the EEA. I also note subsection 41(2) of the Act, which allows the Commission to decline to deal with a section 10(a) complaint where it is of the opinion the matter has been adequately dealt with in the employer\u2019s employment equity plan prepared pursuant to section 10 of the EEA. Subsections 40(3.1), 40.1 and 41(2) of the Act are consistent with the Commission\u2019s responsibility to enforce the obligations imposed on employers under the EEA \u201c\u2026through persuasion and the negotiation of written undertakings\u2026\u201d (see subsections 22(1) and 22(2) of the EEA). As the Respondent pointed out, Parliament has chosen a cooperative and collaborative approach to achieving employment equity, rather than adjudicating such complaints under the Act.\n[45] That said, the wording of subsection 40.1(2) of the Act only mentions the Commission: \u201cNo complaint may be dealt with by the Commission\u2026\u201d (emphasis added). There is no mention of the Tribunal in 40.1(2). That is because, when one examines the scheme of the Act, it is clear that sections 40-46 of the Act relate exclusively to the Commission\u2019s role in receiving and processing complaints under the Act. The Tribunal has no involvement in a complaint until such time as the Commission is satisfied, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted and requests the Tribunal institute such an inquiry pursuant to subsection 49(1) of the Act. As mentioned above, once an inquiry is requested, it is the Tribunal\u2019s role to inquire into the complaint, not question whether the Commission has reasonably concluded an inquiry is warranted (see subsections 49(2) and 50(1) of the Act).\n[46] In addition to the fact subsection 40.1(2) applies strictly to the Commission, I note the wording of paragraph 40.1(2)(b) is concerned with complaints \u201c\u2026based solely on statistical information\u2026\u201d (emphasis added). This wording suggests a complaint under section 7 or paragraph 10(a) of the Act can be supported by statistical information showing underrepresentation, but it cannot be the sole basis for the complaint. That is because the focus of complaints under section 7 and paragraph 10(a) of the Act is on the discriminatory practices set out therein, and not underrepresentation per se. However, statistical evidence of underrepresentation can be useful in human rights complaints and may constitute circumstantial evidence from which inferences of discriminatory conduct may be drawn (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490 at para. 114; Khiamal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2009 FC 495 at paras. 89-102; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 1998 CanLII 7740 (FC) at paras. 10-22).\n[47] In the circumstances of this case, following a judicial review application of the Commission\u2019s October 20, 2008 decision to dismiss the complaint, the Respondent consented to the remittal of the matter of systemic discrimination back to the Commission for a supplemental investigation. No mention of a section 40.1 issue is identified in the Federal Court\u2019s August 18, 2009 decision. Nor was a section 40.1 issue identified by the Respondent during the Commission\u2019s supplemental investigation. Following the completion of the supplementary investigation, the Commission requested an inquiry into Mr. Murray\u2019s complaint as it was satisfied such action was warranted. If the Respondent was of the view the complaint was based solely on statistical information regarding underrepresentation it should have raised section 40.1 of the Act prior to the completion of the Commission\u2019s supplemental investigation, either before the Commission or prior to consenting to the Federal Court\u2019s August 18, 2009 order. It chose not to do so. Furthermore, if it did not agree with the Commission\u2019s decision to request an inquiry into this complaint, it should have sought judicial review of that decision before the Federal Court. Again, it chose not to do so. As mentioned above, it is not open to the Respondent to now seek review of the Commission\u2019s decision before this Tribunal.\n[48] Nor do I accept that paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act now limits the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider the current complaint. As stated above, section 40.1 of the Act applies strictly to the Commission and, once an inquiry is requested, it is the Tribunal\u2019s role to inquire into the complaint. In my view, once a complaint is referred to the Tribunal, the question as to whether or not the complaint is based solely on statistical evidence is a matter to be considered in determining whether the complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination. At this point in the proceedings, prior to having received any evidence on the merits of the complaint, there is no basis upon which the Tribunal can determine if the complaint is based solely on statistical evidence and, consequently, whether the Complainant has established a prima facie case.\n[49] Therefore, paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act does not limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider this complaint.\nC. Does subsection 54.1(2) of the Act limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider the complaint? [50] Similar to its argument regarding paragraph 40.1(2)(b) of the Act, the Respondent submits that in addition to the amendments to the Act mentioned above (ss. 40(3.1), 40.1 and 41(2)), section 54.1 was also added to the Act following the 1995 amendments to the EEA. According to the Respondent, the combined effect of these amendments was to preclude complaints under the Act concerning the underrepresentation of designated groups and avoids duplication between the enforcement mechanisms of the EEA and the Act. Specifically, section 54.1 precludes the Tribunal from ordering the implementation of positive policies or practices regarding the underrepresentation of designated groups. Again, according to the Respondent, as the complaint is based solely on statistical information that purports to show that members of one or more designated groups are underrepresented in the employer\u2019s workforce, section 54.1 bars the Tribunal\u2019s from awarding an effective remedy in this case. As no effective remedy may be ordered, the Respondent submits the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to dismiss the complaint.\n[51] According to the Complainant, section 54.1 of the Act addresses the Tribunal\u2019s remedial authority after it has inquired into a complaint referred to it by the Commission. The Complainant submits section 54.1 simply prevents the Tribunal from ordering employment equity measures that are otherwise covered by the EEA. This is a narrow limit on the Tribunal\u2019s remedial authority that does not otherwise bar it from awarding other remedies if the complaint is substantiated, either directly to the complainant or to address systemic issues.\n[52] According to the Commission, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of section 54.1 is inconsistent with the express language of the Act, as the section does not operate to limit the remedial powers of the Tribunal. When read together with subsection 54.1(3), subsection 54.1(2) of the Act does not limit the Tribunal\u2019s authority to order an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice. The Commission adds, the Tribunal has broad remedial powers under the Act, which allow it to craft creative remedies to address systemic discrimination.\n[53] Subsections 54.1(2) and 54.1(3) of the Act state:\nLimitation of order re employment equity\n(2) Where a Tribunal finds that a complaint against an employer is substantiated, it may not make an order pursuant to subparagraph 53(2)(a)(i) requiring the employer to adopt a special program, plan or arrangement containing\n(a) positive policies and practices designed to ensure that members of designated groups achieve increased representation in the employer\u2019s workforce; or\n(b) goals and timetables for achieving that increased representation.\nInterpretation\n(3) For greater certainty, subsection (2) shall not be construed as limiting the power of a Tribunal, under paragraph 53(2)(a), to make an order requiring an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice.\n[54] As opposed to section 40.1, which applies solely to the Commission, section 54.1 of the Act does apply to the Tribunal. Again, the Tribunal does not dispute that the addition of this section was intended to avoid duplication between the enforcement mechanisms of the EEA and the Act. This is clear when one considers section 10 of the EEA, which requires employers to address the issues found in paragraphs 54.1(2)(a) and 54.1(2)(b) of the Act under their respective employment equity plans. As mentioned above, Parliament has chosen a cooperative and collaborative approach to enforcing the issues in paragraphs 54.1(2)(a) and 54.1(2)(b) of the Act \u201c\u2026through persuasion and the negotiation of written undertakings\u2026\u201d between the Commission and employers under the EEA (see subsections 22(1) and 22(2) of the EEA). Therefore, I agree with the Respondent that the Tribunal cannot make an order requiring a respondent to implement positive policies and practices designed to ensure that members of designated groups achieve increased representation in the employer\u2019s workforce. Nor can the Tribunal make an order that sets goals and timetables for achieving that increased representation.\n[55] That said, I do not agree that the limitations in subsection 54.1(2) of the Act limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to order an effective remedy in this case. Subsection 54.1(3) specifically states subsection 54.1(2) does not limit the power of the Tribunal to make an order requiring an employer to cease or otherwise correct a discriminatory practice under paragraph 53(2)(a) of the Act. Specifically, I note, despite the limitations in 54.1(2) of the Act, paragraph 53(2)(a)(i) still allows the Tribunal to order an employer to adopt a special program, plan or arrangement designed to prevent, eliminate, or reduce disadvantages suffered by any group of individuals. Furthermore, subsection 54.1(2) of the Act does not otherwise limit the Tribunal\u2019s power to order any of the other remedies found at paragraphs 53(2)(b) to 53(2)(e) or subsections 53(3) and 53(4) of the Act.\n[56] I also do not agree that the unavailability of an effective remedy can provide the basis for dismissing a complaint. In this regard, I note the wording of subsection 53(2) of the Act: \u201cIf at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may\u2026make an order\u2026\u201d (emphasis added). The wording of subsection 53(2) suggests the Tribunal\u2019s remedial authority is only invoked at the conclusion of an inquiry, once a complaint has been substantiated. Therefore, the Act does not seem to allow the Tribunal to dismiss a complaint preliminarily on the basis that there is no effective remedy. In any event, the Respondent\u2019s argument also assumes the Tribunal is obliged to order a remedy. The use of the word \u201cmay\u201d in subsection 53(2) of Act suggests the Tribunal has the discretionary authority to make an order, or not. In certain circumstances, while a complaint may be substantiated, it may be appropriate for the Tribunal not to make an order. In each case, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion will be exercised in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented.\n[57] Therefore, subsection 54.1(2) of the Act does not limit the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider this complaint.\nD. Is there reason to dismiss the complaint based on the principles of issue estoppel or abuse of process? [58] Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Figliola, 2011 SCC 52 [Figliola], and the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Transportation Agency, 2011 FCA 332 [Morten], the Respondent argues the Tribunal should exercise its discretion to dismiss the complaint on the basis of issue estoppel and\/or abuse of process. According to the Respondent, the issues of clustering and underrepresentation, both in the total workforce and in acting and permanent positions of the IRB\u2019s Toronto Regional Office, have been investigated by the employer, external consultants and the Commission. The Respondent adds, these issues have also been adjudicated by the PSST and are scheduled to be litigated before the PSLRB.\n[59] With specific regard to the PSST proceedings, the Respondent submits the current human rights complaint involves the same facts and issues. Furthermore, while the Commission was given the opportunity to participate in the PSST proceedings, it declined to do so. According to the Respondent, the PSST found it had jurisdiction to hear complaints of abuse of authority where systemic discrimination is alleged and allowed the Complainant to introduce evidence in this regard. After reviewing all the evidence, the PSST concluded the Complainant had not established a prima facie case of discrimination and dismissed his complaint. The Respondent adds, while the PSST decision only deals with the PM classification (rather than the PM, CR, AS and LA classifications that are now claimed in this human rights complaint), this is not an argument for seeing the PSST and Tribunal proceedings as different. Rather, the Respondent submits it is another basis for arguing that the course of action taken by the Complainant is an abuse of process, as he has now expanded the scope of the complaint to include several other classifications.\n[60] The Complainant submits the doctrines of issue estoppel and abuse of process are inapplicable to the present case. According to the Complainant, it makes no difference whether or to what extent, the employer, or anyone acting on its behalf, investigated any aspect of the complaint now before the Tribunal. The Tribunal is not bound by any of the employer\u2019s findings on any of the issues that fall within the complaint. Furthermore, the Complainant argues investigation reports prepared by the Commission are not decisions of the Commission, and the Tribunal is not bound by them. The inquiry before the Tribunal is a fresh one, and the investigators findings or recommendations are not binding on the merits of the complaint. With regard to the group grievance before the PSLRB, the Complainant submits the matter is irrelevant. The Figliola principles and the doctrine of issue estoppel require that the same question has been decided and that the earlier decision was final. At the time of this motion, the PSLRB had yet to hear the grievance or render a final decision. The Complainant adds, the respondent in the group grievance is the Treasury Board, and not the IRB.\n[61] On the PSST complaint, the Complainant claims it dealt only with whether the employer\u2019s decision to select a non-advertised appointment process for a PM-05 Tribunal Office position was tainted by systemic discrimination. According to the Complainant, the PSST has no authority to inquire into broader issues of discrimination that fall outside of a specific appointment process, neither can it remedy systemic discrimination issues. Therefore, the PSST did not, and could not, examine any other issues identified in the current human rights complaint. The Complainant adds, as the present human rights complaint was presented on April 22, 2004, it could not have contained allegations with respect to an appointment process that occurred at least two years later. Also, the PSST had no jurisdiction to address the Complainant\u2019s broader concerns that, as a result of systemic discrimination at the IRB, he has been deprived of employment opportunities and subject to discriminatory conduct, including harassment, which has affected his ability to perform his job. Therefore, the Complainant submits that it cannot be said that the issue decided by the PSST was essentially the same as the issues in the present human rights complaint.\n[62] According to the Commission, the investigations conducted by the employer are internal investigations, separate from any determination to be made by this Tribunal and related to an allegation of harassment, which is not before this Tribunal. The Commission submits the external consultants referenced by the Respondent relate to findings by an employment equity audit, which found there was clustering of visible minorities at the PM-01 level.\n[63] With regard to the PSST complaint, the Commission submits the present complaint does not raise the same issues. According to the Commission, a review of the PSST decision indicates that any systemic discrimination matters raised were peripheral to the central issue addressed: whether there had been an abuse of authority, pursuant to section 77 of the PSEA, in the IRB\u2019s decision to staff new PM-05 positions using an unadvertised process. According to the Commission, in the current proceedings, the issue is different: whether systemic discrimination by the Respondent deprives the Complainant and other visible minority employees of employment opportunities on the basis of race, or national or ethnic origin. The Commission adds, the legal and factual issues before the Tribunal in the current complaint are distinct from those in Figliola and Morten. In both cases, the complainants had chosen to bypass the appeal process before them and file a separate human rights complaint concurrently. In this case, the Complainant has not bypassed the appeal process at any tribunal.\n[64] Furthermore, the Commission submits the Human Rights Code of British Columbia, the legislative scheme under which the decision in Figliola was made, differs significantly from the Act. Specifically, the Commission points to paragraph 27(1)(f) of the Human Rights Code of British Columbia, which allows the BC Human Rights Tribunal to dismiss a complaint where the substance of the complaint has been appropriately dealt with in another proceeding. The Ontario Human Rights Code contains a similar provision at section 45.1. According to the Commission, the Act does not contemplate a comparable section as those in both British Columbia and in Ontario. While paragraph 41(1)(b) of the Act allows the Commission not to deal with a complaint where it could more appropriately be dealt with according to a procedure provided for under another Act, the Commission states this section specifically deals with the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction and not the Tribunal\u2019s. As a result, although the principles set out in Figliola are applicable to administrative decision makers in general, it is necessary to consider the context of the applicable legislation in each case.\n[65] The doctrines of issue estoppel, abuse of process and collateral attack \u201cexist to prevent unfairness by preventing abuse of the decision-making process\u201d (Figliola at para. 34). In Figliola, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada summarized the common principles which underlie these doctrines:\n\u2022 It is in the interests of the public and the parties that the finality of a decision can be relied on.\n\u2022 Respect for the finality of a judicial or administrative decision increases fairness and the integrity of the courts, administrative tribunals and the administration of justice; on the other hand, relitigation of issues that have been previously decided in an appropriate forum may undermine confidence in this fairness and integrity by creating inconsistent results and unnecessarily duplicative proceedings.\n\u2022 The method of challenging the validity or correctness of a judicial or administrative decision should be through the appeal or judicial review mechanisms that are intended by the legislature.\n\u2022 Parties should not circumvent the appropriate review mechanism by using other forums to challenge a judicial or administrative decision.\n\u2022 Avoiding unnecessary relitigation avoids an unnecessary expenditure of resources.\n(see Figliola at para. 34)\n[66] Based on these principles, a tribunal determining a request that it not hear a proceeding, because the subject matter of the proceeding has previously been the subject of adjudication by another tribunal, should ask the following questions:\n\u2022 whether there was concurrent jurisdiction to decide human rights issues;\n\u2022 whether the previously decided legal issue was essentially the same as what is being complained of to the Tribunal; and,\n\u2022 whether there was an opportunity for the complainants or their privies to know the case to be met and have the chance to meet it, regardless of how closely the previous process procedurally mirrored the one the Tribunal prefers or uses itself.\n(see Figliola at para. 37)\nAccording to a majority of the Supreme Court: \u201cAt the end of the day, it is really a question of whether it makes sense to expend public and private resources on the relitigation of what is essentially the same dispute\u201d (Figliola at para. 37).\n[67] In examining the issue estoppel\/abuse of process issue in this case, I find the Tribunal need only be concerned with what the PSST decision may have decided. Any investigations conducted by the Respondent or its external consultants are irrelevant. Neither the Respondent, nor its external consultants, has any statutory jurisdiction to decide human rights issues. The same applies to the Commission\u2019s investigations. As mentioned above, in dealing with human rights complaints, the Commission\u2019s role is one of receiving and processing complaints. The Commission only decides whether an inquiry by the Tribunal is warranted or not. The Commission\u2019s investigation and decision does not decide the merits of the human rights issues in a given case. That is the role of the Tribunal under the Act: to inquire into complaints referred to it by the Commission (see ss. 49(2) and 50 of the Act).\n[68] With regard to the group grievance under the PSLRA, there is no decision from the PSLRB regarding the complaint. While the PSRLB may have concurrent jurisdiction to decide human rights issues, there is no \u201cpreviously decided legal issue\u201d to speak of.\n[69] In examining the PSST decision, the Commission argues that it is necessary for the Tribunal to consider the context of the legislative scheme under which the decision in Figliola was made, and how that legislative scheme differs from the Act. However, I find this has no bearing on the matter. In Figliola, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada stated that paragraph 27(1)(f) of the British Columbia Human Rights Code reflects the common law doctrines of issue estoppel, abuse of process and collateral attack (see para. 25). Specifically, the majority stated:\ns. 27(1)(f) is the statutory reflection of the collective principles underlying those doctrines, doctrines used by the common law as vehicles to transport and deliver to the litigation process principles of finality, the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings, and protection for the integrity of the administration of justice, all in the name of fairness.\n(Figliola at para. 25, emphasis added)\n[70] In Morten, the Federal Court of Appeal found the Supreme Court\u2019s comments to be apposite to \u201cthe application of these common law principles by the Tribunal\u201d (at para. 24). In applying these principles to the Tribunal\u2019s decision in that case, the Federal Court of Appeal found that the Tribunal \u201cdid not engage in the required analysis\u201d (at para. 28). That analysis required the Tribunal to consider \u201c...the unfairness inherent in serial forum shopping\u201d (Morten at para. 28, emphasis added).\n[71] Given the comments of the Court in Figliola and Morten, I fail to see how the scheme of the Act, and specifically paragraph 41(1)(b), affects the issue estoppel\/abuse of process analysis in this case. Paragraph 41(1)(b) applies only to the Commission in its screening and investigatory role under the Act. As mentioned above, once the complaint is referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, the proceedings are de novo. In this regard, the Federal Court in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society stated there is \u201c[n]othing in either the Act or the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure [that] limits the type of motions that can be brought before the Tribunal\u201d (at para. 131); and, specifically acknowledged the Tribunal can determine an abuse of process issue in advance of a full hearing of the complaint on its merits (at paras. 133-139). Therefore, paragraph 41(1)(b) of the Act does not affect the Tribunal\u2019s ability to consider common law fairness doctrines. In considering the issue estoppel\/abuse of process question in this motion, the Tribunal is not questioning the Commission\u2019s decision to deal with the complaint or to request an inquiry; rather, as stated in Figliola and Morten, the Tribunal is ensuring the fairness of its de novo proceedings. As the Federal Court stated in Canada Post, \u201cone cannot maintain that the Tribunal is the \"master in its own house\" if it cannot protect its own process from abuse\u201d (at para. 15).\n[72] Moving on to the application of the Figliola principles to the PSST\u2019s decision, the first question is whether the PSST had concurrent jurisdiction to decide human rights issues. In Figliola, relying on its decision in Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program), 2006 SCC 14, the majority of the Supreme Court stated: \u201cabsent express language to the contrary, all administrative tribunals have concurrent jurisdiction to apply human rights legislation\u201d (Figliola at para. 45). The complaint before the PSST was filed under section 77 of the PSEA (see Murray at para. 4). In considering whether a complaint under section 77 is substantiated, section 80 of the PSEA provides the PSST \u201c...may interpret and apply the Canadian Human Rights Act, other than its provisions relating to the right to equal pay for work of equal value\u201d. Before the PSST, the Complainant alleged the Respondent\u2019s choice to use a non-advertised appointment process to staff new PM-05 positions discriminated against him on the basis of this race. He alleged that this non-advertised process constituted systemic discrimination where job barriers result in a clustering of visible minorities in CO positions at the PM-01 group and level (see Murray at para. 1). These allegations did not require the PSST to interpret or apply the provisions of the Act relating to the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Therefore, the PSST had the express jurisdiction to decide the human rights issues alleged in the PSEA complaint.\n[73] The second question is whether the previously decided legal issue was essentially the same as what is being complained of to the Tribunal. As mentioned above, the issue before the PSST was whether the Respondent\u2019s choice to use a non-advertised appointment process to staff new PM-05 positions discriminated against the Complainant on the basis of his race. To substantiate his allegation, the Complaint did not advance direct evidence of discrimination against him, but led circumstantial evidence of systemic discrimination at the IRB. In analyzing this evidence, the PSST proceeded on the basis that \u201c[t]he evidence must establish first that systemic barriers exist, and, secondly, that there is a link between the evidence of systemic barriers and evidence of individual discrimination against the complainant, based on race\u201d (Murray at para. 103). After examining the Complainant\u2019s circumstantial evidence, the PSST concluded that \u201cthe complainant has not adduced sufficient circumstantial evidence to substantiate his allegation of systemic discrimination\u201d (Murray at para. 99). Even if there was evidence of systemic barriers, the PSST also concluded that \u201cthere is insufficient evidence before the Tribunal that links the alleged systemic barriers to individual discrimination against the complainant\u201d (Murray at para. 103).\n[74] Before this Tribunal, in the context of the current motion, the Complainant described his human rights complaint as follows: \u201cas a result of systemic discrimination at the IRB, he has been deprived of employment opportunities and subject to discriminatory conduct, including harassment, which has affected his ability to perform his job\u201d (at para. 70 of the Complainant\u2019s Response to the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss). Similarly, the Commission describes the complaint as follows: \u201cIn the current complaint before this Tribunal, the issue concerns an allegation of systemic discrimination by the Respondent which deprives Mr. Murray and other visible minority employees of employment opportunities on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin\u201d (at para. 48 of the Submissions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (re the Respondent\u2019s Motion to dismiss)). Despite not having received Statements of Particulars detailing the specifics of the Complainant\u2019s allegations, both the Complainant and the Commission\u2019s characterization of the complaint make it clear that allegations of systemic discrimination within the IRB form the basis of Mr. Murray\u2019s complaint now before this Tribunal. This characterization of the complaint as a \u201csystemic discrimination\u201d complaint was also reinforced by the Complainant and the Commission during the hearing of these motions.\n[75] While the adverse effects of the alleged systemic discrimination may be different before the Tribunal than they were before the PSST, including the number of people affected, the underlying issue remains the same: whether the IRB has engaged in a discriminatory practice against Mr. Murray as a result of alleged systemic practices based on race. The PSST has already concluded that the Complainant has insufficient evidence to establish that there exists systemic race based barriers within the IRB. As outlined above, the fact that the PSST was examining whether there was discrimination in relation to a single appointment process did not change the nature of this finding. The PSST first determined that there was insufficient evidence to establish the existence of systemic barriers, before moving on to whether that evidence established discrimination in the particular circumstances of section 77 of the PSEA. In the current complaint, the Complainant again puts in issue the existence of systemic race based barriers within the IRB, and that those barriers have resulted in discrimination against him. As the PSST has previously decided that the Complainant has insufficient evidence to establish the existence of systemic race based barriers within the IRB, I find the PSST has decided essentially the same legal issue as what is currently being complained of to the Tribunal.\n[76] The third question is whether there was an opportunity for the Complainant to know the case to be met and have the chance to meet it. Before the PSST, the Complainant had an opportunity to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the Respondent engaged in a prima facie discriminatory practice by advancing circumstantial evidence of systemic barriers at IRB. The PSST held a hearing and the Complainant led evidence in the form of reports dealing with employment equity at the IRB, expert testimony of systemic discrimination, and testimony of current and former colleagues (see Murray at para. 87). While the focus of the evidence before the PSST was on whether the employment practices of the IRB created a \u201cbad\u201d cluster of visible minority employees at the lower ranks of the IRB - which is also one of the systemic barriers identified by the Complainant in the present complaint - there was nothing preventing the Complainant from adducing evidence regarding other alleged systemic barriers at the IRB, which may now form part of the present complaint. This is reinforced by the fact that the PSST complaint was filed and adjudicated after the filing of the present complaint. Any alleged systemic barriers at the IRB forming the basis of the present complaint were known to the Complainant prior to adjudicating the PSST complaint. These alleged systemic barriers, and any evidence thereof, could have, and should have, been brought forward before the PSST as part of the Complainant\u2019s circumstantial evidence of systemic discrimination in that case.\n[77] Therefore, in the course of adjudicating his PSEA complaint, the Complainant had a full and ample opportunity to present his case regarding systemic discrimination at the IRB. Now before the Tribunal, it does not make sense to expend public and private resources on the re-litigation of what is essentially the same allegation. The Tribunal\u2019s role is not to \u201c...\u201cjudicially review\u201d another tribunal\u2019s decision, or to reconsider a legitimately decided issue in order to explore whether it might yield a different outcome\u201d (Figliola at para. 38). As the Complainant is currently doing, the proper way to challenge the PSST\u2019s decision is through an application for judicial review.\n[78] In applying the doctrines of issue estoppel\/abuse of process, and the principles outlined in Figliola, I find that the subject matter of the current proceeding has previously been the subject of adjudication by the PSST. Therefore, as adjudicating the present complaint would amount to an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process, it should be dismissed.\n[79] For these reasons, the Respondent\u2019s Motion to Dismiss the complaint is granted. Therefore, it is not necessary to deal with issues E to I outlined in paragraphs 32 and 33 above.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Complaint [1] As part of his employment, the Complainant was required to relocate from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Ottawa, Ontario. The Complainant\u2019s wife did not relocate to Ottawa with the Complainant, due in part to her mother\u2019s ailing health. As a result, the Complainant and his wife maintained dual residences. In this regard, the Complainant made an expense claim for temporary dual residence assistance under the Respondent\u2019s applicable Relocation Directive. That claim was denied.\n[2] The present complaint revolves around the Respondent\u2019s interpretation and application of its Relocation Directive. In its interpretation and application of this Relocation Directive, the Complainant alleges the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], on the basis of family status and disability.\nII. Background [3] The Tribunal held a hearing in this matter from April 15 to 17, and on May 7, 2013 in Ottawa, Ontario.\n[4] On the first day of the hearing, the parties agreed on a partial statement of material facts. These agreed facts are as follows.\n[5] The Complainant worked in Sydney, Nova Scotia, for the federal government in the federally-regulated underground coal mining industry in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. He was a Principal Advisor, EN-ENG-05, for the Coal Mining Safety Commission.\n[6] In 1999, the Complainant\u2019s employer, the Respondent, informed him that his position would become redundant.\n[7] On January 21, 2002, the Complainant received a formal letter of offer\/deployment to Ottawa, dated January 14, 2002 from Micheline B\u00e9langer-Brul\u00e9, Human Resources Manager for the Respondent. The letter states, \u201cRelocation Expenses will be reimbursed at public expense according to the Treasury Board Relocation Directive.\u201d\n[8] On February 18, 2002, a letter from Warren Edmondson was sent to the Complainant to inform him of the condition of his deployment and with a revised letter of deployment (the \u201cFebruary 18, 2002 Letter\u201d).\n[9] By e-mail of February 21, 2002, the Complainant accepted the revised offer of deployment. On February 27, 2002, a letter was sent to the Complainant from Ms. B\u00e9langer-Brul\u00e9, confirming his acceptance of the conditions in the February 18, 2002 Letter and advising that he had been deployed to his new position as of March 4, 2002.\n[10] The Complainant was deployed as a full time indeterminate Industrial Safety Engineer, EN-ENG-05 position for the Respondent\u2019s Labour Branch, Occupational Health and Safety and Injury Compensation Division located in National Headquarters in Hull, Quebec (\u201cNHQ\u201d).\n[11] The Complainant began work at NHQ on September 16, 2002. He officially relocated to Ottawa on October 17, 2002.\n[12] The Complainant\u2019s family, including his wife, did not relocate with him in October 2002 due in part, to his mother-in-law\u2019s serious health problems.\n[13] The Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law moved to an assisted-living apartment in approximately May 2002 and was living in this assisted-living apartment when he relocated to NHQ in October 2002. His mother-in-law moved to a full-care nursing home on October 9, 2003.\n[14] On September 22, 2004, the Complainant applied for financial assistance under the Treasury Board of Canada\u2019s Temporary Dual Residence Assistance (\u201cTDRA\u201d) Directive. The reason he gave for claiming financial assistance was, among other things, that his wife had to stay in Sydney, Nova Scotia, to care for her mother. The amount of the claim, with respect to the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law, was $21,247.00 covering the first twelve months of the relocation period, namely from October 1, 2002 to September 20, 2003.\n[15] The Relocation Directive in effect at the beginning of the Complainant\u2019s relocation was \u201cRelocation Directive \u2013 Effective Until March 31, 2003 (Archived)\u201d, which came into effect March 1993 (\u201c1993 Relocation Directive\u201d). The Relocation Directive, including the TDRA, is deemed part of the collective agreement governing the Complainant\u2019s terms and conditions of employment.\n[16] For the purposes of this complaint, the relevant portions of the 1993 Relocation Directive are:\nPurpose and scope\nIt is the policy of the government that in any relocation, the aim shall be to relocate the employee in the most efficient fashion, that is, at the most reasonable cost to the public yet having a minimum detrimental effect on the transferred employee and family.\n[...]\nApplication\nThis directive applies to the following departments, agencies and corporations as listed in the Financial Administration Act:\n- all Schedule I, I.1 departments,\n- all Schedule II departmental corporations,\n- those Schedule C corporations listed in Part I of Schedule I of the Public Service Staff Relations Act, and\n- branches of government designated as departments for purposes of the Financial Administration Act with the exception of Royal Commissions.\nUnless specifically stated otherwise, the relocations provisions shall apply to all relocations within Canada resulting from a transfer or an appointment that originated in the Public Service of Canada as defined in section 11(1) of the Financial Administration Act. These provisions do not apply to members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Canadian Armed Forces.\n[...]\nUnless specifically stated otherwise, the standards, rates or allowances and the reimbursement of expenses incurred as authorized in this chapter shall be applied to all eligible persons irrespective of their age, sex, marital or family status, or disability.\n[...]\nDefinitions\nDependant (personne \u00e0 charge) - means any person who lives with the employee or appointee and is either the employee's spouse, a person for whom the employee can claim a personal exemption under the Income Tax Act, or an employee's (or a spouse's) unmarried child, step-child, adopted child or legal ward who cannot be claimed as an income tax deduction but is in full-time attendance at school. A family member who is permanently residing with the employee, but who is precluded from qualifying as a dependant under the Income Tax Act because the family member receives a pension, shall also be considered as a dependant under this directive;\n[...]\n1.2 Responsibilities\n1.2.1 For any relocation, the terms and conditions of reimbursement shall be discussed with the person relocating at the time of the authorization to relocate.\n1.2.2 Once a relocation has been authorized:\n[...]\n(c) every attempt will be made to ensure that the timing of the relocation, and the travelling associated with it, is convenient to both the employer and the employee. The relocation should be planned to minimize disruptions to family life, and to minimize the costs to the employer; to this end, managers shall ensure that employees who are relocating receive appropriate counselling, and also that employees' enquiries regarding this directive are answered promptly and accurately.\nTemporary dual residence assistance (TDRA)\n2.11 Criteria\n2.11.1 Financial assistance is intended to offset the cost of maintaining the second residence. The employee remains responsible for one set of household expenses.\n2.11.2 Financial assistance towards living expenses can be obtained in situations when two residences are temporarily maintained during the initial stages of a relocation, i.e.:\n(a) when one of the residences is occupied by dependant(s) (a term which includes a spouse):\n- for reasons of temporary illness, or\n[...]\n[17] Financial assistance under the TDRA can only be claimed in respect of a dependant, and only someone \u201cwho has been living with the employee prior to relocation\u201d qualifies as a \u201cdependant\u201d under the 1993 Relocation Directive.\n[18] On April 1, 2009 the definition of \u201cdependant\u201d under the Relocation Directive was expanded to include \u201ca person who resides outside the employee\u2019s residence and for whom the employee has formally declared a responsibility for assistance and\/or support\u201d.\n[19] On November 23, 2004, the Respondent denied the Complainant\u2019s application for financial assistance under the TDRA.\n[20] The Complainant filed a grievance challenging the denial of the TDRA, which was received on December 2, 2004.\n[21] The Complainant\u2019s grievance was heard at the first level in January 2005. He received the Respondent\u2019s decision denying his grievance on February 10, 2005. The basis for the denial was that the Complainant was \u201cnot eligible for the Temporary Dual Residence Assistance since he was a renter and not the owner of a house in Sydney\u201d.\n[22] The Complainant\u2019s grievance was heard at the second level and a decision denying that grievance was rendered on June 17, 2005. The reason provided for the denial was that \u201cyour claim for your mother-in-law could not be approved as she was not living with you in the principal residence, and as such, cannot be considered a dependant pursuant to the 1993 Relocation Directive.\u201d\n[23] The Complainant\u2019s grievance was heard at the third level on March 15, 2006 before the National Joint Council (\u201cNJC\u201d)\u2019s Executive Committee. The grievance was denied for the same reasons as at the second level.\n[24] The Complainant\u2019s grievance was then referred to adjudication before the Public Service Labour Relations Board (\u201cPSLRB\u201d) on July 18, 2006.\n[25] On July 19, 2006, the Complainant filed the instant complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d).\n[26] In the meantime, the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law passed away on January 13, 2007, while she was living in the full-care nursing home.\n[27] The parties to the grievance, the Complainant and Respondent, jointly submitted to the adjudicator a \u201cStatement of Agreed Facts\u201d that is signed by representatives for the two parties, and dated January 26, 2007.\n[28] The grievance was heard by expedited adjudication on January 26, 2007. The PSLRB rendered its decision denying the Complainant\u2019s grievance on February 2, 2007. The grievance was denied for the same reasons as at the third level (see Hicks v. Treasury Board (Department of Human Resources and Skills Development), 2007 PSLRB 16).\n[29] On October 26, 2007, the Commission advised the Complainant that it would not deal with his complaint, pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(c) of the Act. The Complainant sought judicial review of the Commission decision and the Federal Court allowed the application (see Hicks v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FC 1059).\n[30] The Commission commenced investigation of the Complainant\u2019s complaint, and ultimately recommended conciliation in its Investigation Report of July 12, 2010. Conciliation took place, but was unsuccessful, and the matter was referred back to the Commission.\n[31] On November 9, 2011, the Commission referred the matter to this Tribunal.\nIII. The Complainant\u2019s Case [32] The Complainant alleges violations of sections 7 and 10 of the Act, on the basis of the prohibited grounds of family status and disability. In this regard, the relevant portions of the Act are as follows:\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[33] The complainant in proceedings before the Tribunal must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is \u201c\u2026one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2026\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para. 28).\n[34] Despite the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the present complaint is limited to whether the definition of \u201cdependant\u201d in the 1993 Relocation Directive is discriminatory, the Complainant states the nature of his complaint as: whether the Respondent\u2019s decision to decline payment of the TDRA was discriminatory. The Complainant\u2019s complaint form and statement of particulars have been consistent with this position, and I see no reason to limit the scope of the complaint as suggested by the Respondent.\n[35] That said, there is no claim that the Respondent refused to employ or to continue to employ the Complainant, pursuant to subsection 7(a) of the Act; or, that the Respondent\u2019s interpretation and application of the 1993 Relocation Directive resulted in the Complainant being deprived of employment opportunities, pursuant to section 10 of the Act. Therefore, in my view, this complaint is limited to an analysis under subsection 7(b) of the Act.\n[36] Similarly, I do not view the prohibited ground of disability as being applicable in the circumstances of this case. The alleged victim in this case, the Complainant, does not suffer from a disability. Rather, it was his mother-in-law who suffered from a disability. While her disability may have been a factor that defined the Complainant\u2019s family status in the circumstances giving rise to this complaint, the Complainant himself was not treated adversely because of his own disability, nor is he claiming that his mother-in-law was the victim of discrimination on the basis of her disability.\n[37] Therefore, in analyzing the Complainant\u2019s case, I will only examine whether the Complainant, in the course of employment, was differentiated adversely on the basis of his family status, pursuant to subsection 7(b) of the Act.\n[38] To \u201cdifferentiate\u201d is to create a distinction or to treat someone differently (see Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2009 FC 1009 at para. 44 [Tahmourpour]; varied on other grounds in Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2010 FCA 192 [Tahmourpour (FCA)]; and, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445 at para. 254, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 75). However, not every distinction is discriminatory, as the Act qualifies the differential treatment with the term \u201cadversely\u201d. According to the Federal Court, \u201cadverse\u201d is an adjective that in its ordinary meaning means harmful, hurtful or hostile (see Tahmourpour at para. 44; see also Tahmourpour (FCA) at para. 12). Finally, the adverse differential treatment must be based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[39] The 1993 Relocation Directive and the criteria for claiming TDRA create a distinction between persons who are \u201cpermanently residing with the employee\u201d and those who are not. The Respondent also says the Complainant was also ineligible for TDRA because his mother-in-law was not a person suffering from a \u201ctemporary illness\u201d pursuant to clause 2.11.2(a) of the 1993 Relocation Directive, but rather was chronically ill.\n[40] These distinctions were harmful to the Complainant because it resulted in the denial of his claim for TDRA. The denial of his claim was also hurtful to the Complainant because he interpreted the Respondent\u2019s decision to mean that his mother-in-law was not considered as a member of his family. The Complainant also testified that the denial of his TDRA claim and subsequent grievances resulted in stress and frustration towards his employer. This stress resulted in physical problems: not being able to sleep, digestion problems, and heart murmurs. Eventually, the Complainant says the stress resulted in him having to take a 40 day stress leave.\n[41] The next question is whether the adverse distinctions created by the 1993 Relocation Directive towards the Complainant were based on his family status. The term family status is not defined in the Act. However, jurisprudence has recognized that the ground protects the absolute status of being or not being in a family relationship; the relative status of who one\u2019s family members are; the particular circumstances or characteristics of one\u2019s family; and, the duties and obligations that may arise within the family (see B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66 at paras. 39-41, 57; and, Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113 at paras. 104-113 [Johnstone]).\n[42] There is no dispute that the Complainant\u2019s spouse and mother-in-law are a part of the Complainant\u2019s family. Nor does the Respondent dispute that eldercare responsibilities can be protected by the ground of family status. While I am unaware of any decisions from the Tribunal on the issue of eldercare, I find the rationale of the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario in Devaney v. ZRV Holdings Limited, 2012 HRTO 1590 [Devaney] to be relevant.\n[43] In that case, Mr. Devaney was an architect who had been dismissed because he had to be absent from work, and a significant portion of those absences were required due to his family circumstances: he had to take care of his mother who was very ill. There was no other member of his family to take care of her. His mother was on a critical waiting list for a long-term care facility, but until she was able to move, the son was the primary health-care provider. The employer was aware of Mr. Devaney\u2019s family situation, but dismissed him for his absences. On this basis, the Ontario Tribunal decided that Mr. Devaney had established a discriminatory practice on the basis of his family status.\n[44] In my view, the rationale of Devaney is: just as the jurisprudence recognizes family status as protecting the childcare obligations of a parent towards a child, the reciprocal eldercare responsibilities of a child towards their parent should also be recognized in the same fashion. I agree with this rationale.\n[45] At the hearing of this matter, the Complainant and his wife testified about the eldercare responsibilities that they felt towards their mother\/mother-in-law and that they could not have immediately moved to Ottawa without abandoning those responsibilities. They explained that their mother\/mother-in-law was not living with them because her health condition required assistance that could not be offered in their home. Furthermore, because of her fragile health, her doctors did not permit her being transported by ambulance or even by plane to Ottawa. The Complainant and his wife were also of the opinion that support could not adequately and reasonably be provided only by third-party caregivers. This is the conclusion that they had reached after years of observing and caring for their mother\/mother-in-law as her health steadily declined.\n[46] In this regard, the Complainant and his wife testified to the effect that the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s health started deteriorating around 2001 and the related responsibilities the Complainant\u2019s wife took on to care for her mother. At the time of the Complainant\u2019s relocation, his mother-in-law was then living in an assisted-living apartment and was depending a lot on her daughter. The Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law had great difficulty expressing herself and indicating her needs, and few people could communicate with her. However, the Complainant\u2019s wife could.\n[47] While the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law was living in the senior\u2019s apartment (assisted-living apartment), the Complainant\u2019s wife testified to providing care in the following ways: she checked in on her several times a day; did her laundry; did her daily external chores, such as groceries and paying bills; prepared her meals and\/or arranged for prepared meals to be delivered; arranged home care assistance (meals, cleaning, bathing, etc.) and regular home nursing care; arranged and accompanied her on doctors\u2019 visits; and, provided all of her social interaction by arranging regular visits and supervised excursions.\n[48] According to the Complainant, the presence of his wife was highly beneficial for her mother\u2019s emotional well-being. She communicated frequently with the nursing home staff, and continuously monitored her mother\u2019s health.\n[49] As the Complainant\u2019s testimony indicates, but for the Complainant\u2019s family status, that is his and his wife\u2019s commitment to care for their elderly and disabled mother\/mother-in-law, maintaining dual residences following the Complainant\u2019s relocation would not have been necessary, nor would a TDRA claim have arisen.\n[50] However, the Respondent argues that the denial of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim did not result in a conflict between his family obligations and work-related requirements. According to the Respondent, the Complainant admitted that his mother-in-law was cared for by his wife, notwithstanding the denial of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim.\n[51] I agree that the circumstances of this complaint do not give rise to an \u201c...employment rule or condition [that] interferes with an employee\u2019s ability to meet a substantial [family] obligation in any realistic way...\u201d (see Johnstone at para. 125). The nature of the present complaint is not a conflict between the Complainant\u2019s work and family obligations, but relates to the denial of a benefit.\n[52] The Complainant argues that discrimination arises from the Respondent\u2019s under-inclusive provision of its TDRA benefit. On this point, the Supreme Court of Canada has indicated that:\nUnderinclusion may be simply a backhanded way of permitting discrimination. Increasingly, employee benefit plans have become part of the terms and conditions of employment. Once an employer decides to provide an employee benefit package, exclusions from such schemes may not be made in a discriminatory fashion...Benefits available through employment must be disbursed in a non-discriminatory manner.\nBrooks v. Canada Safeway ltd., [1989] 1 SCR 1219 at p. 1240\n[53] In determining whether a benefits scheme is prima facie discriminatory, the first step is to determine the purpose of the benefit plan. If the benefits are \u201c...allocated pursuant to the same purpose, yet benefits differ as the result of characteristics that are not relevant to this purpose, discrimination may well exist\u201d (Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. v. Gibbs, [1996] 3 SCR 566 at para. 33).\n[54] As outlined above, the purpose of the 1993 Relocation Directive was \u201c...to relocate the employee in the most efficient fashion, that is, at the most reasonable cost to the public yet having a minimum detrimental effect on the transferred employee and family\u201d. Clause 1.2.2(c) of the 1993 Relocation Directive also provides that \u201cThe relocation should be planned to minimize disruptions to family life, and to minimize the costs to the employer...\u201d.\n[55] As is clear from these statements, the 1993 Relocation Directive was designed to assist transferred employees with relocating their lives, in the most efficient manner, while recognizing that efficiency must be balanced against any detrimental effects to the transferred employee or his\/her family. The 1993 Relocation Directive was also supposed to apply to \u201c...all eligible persons irrespective of their...family status...\u201d.\n[56] Despite the broad purpose and application of the 1993 Relocation Directive, the Complainant was denied the TDRA because of the characteristics of his family: that he and his wife cared for his elderly mother-in-law who, because of a permanent disability, could not live with them in the family home.\n[57] Having found that eldercare duties fall within the protection against discrimination on the basis of family status under the Act; that the characteristics of the Complainant\u2019s family were defined by his and his wife\u2019s eldercare responsibilities towards their mother\/mother-in-law; and, that the Complainant was denied TDRA because of those family characteristics; therefore, the Respondent\u2019s denial of the Complainant\u2019s expense claim under the TDRA constitutes a prima facie discriminatory practice, under subsection 7(b) of the Act . The Complainant\u2019s evidence is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in his favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent.\nIV. The Respondent\u2019s Case [58] Since I am satisfied that the Complainant has demonstrated prima facie discrimination on the ground of family status, the burden shifts to the Respondent to demonstrate that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act (see sections 15-24 of the Act).\n[59] The Respondent claims its 1993 Relocation Directive and the criteria used to determine whether an employee is eligible for the TDRA is a bona fide occupational requirement. In this regard, the Act provides:\n15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\n[...]\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost.\n[60] According to the Respondent, a rational basis exists for limiting financial assistance under the TDRA to family members living with the employees who otherwise qualify as dependants: employees do not need to maintain a second residence to facilitate their relocation unless they have dependant family members residing with them in these residences who are unable to relocate at the same time as the employee. In the Respondent\u2019s view, family members residing in their own homes do not need employees to maintain their former homes for them. It is on the basis of this assumption that the Respondent says the federal Crown and the other parties to the 1993 Relocation Directive defined who is a dependant.\n[61] The Respondent submits that family members having other needs, whether related to their medical or day-to-day care, and claiming financial assistance in respect of those needs, fall outside the coverage of the TDRA. According to the Respondent, assistance is not given for the voluntary separation of the family for personal reasons. The Respondent argues the TDRA is not intended to facilitate medical and other care giving arrangements for family members, but to allow them to continue living in the employee\u2019s former residence until able to relocate with the employee.\n[62] Mr. Daniel Gauthier, Chief, Accounts Payable and Receipt and Deposit, for Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, testified on behalf of the Respondent. The main part of his testimony was made in relation to the 1993 Relocation Directive and his knowledge of the Complainant\u2019s application under the TDRA.\n[63] Mr. Gauthier explained that the Complainant\u2019s claim under the TDRA could not be accepted because: (1) the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law could not be considered a \u201cdependant\u201d under the 1993 Relocation Directive since she had not been living in the Complainant\u2019s home at the time of the Complainant\u2019s relocation; and, (2) the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law was considered as a permanently disabled person and not as a temporary ill person as required by section 2.11.2 of the 1993 Relocation Directive.\n[64] Mr. Gauthier also stated the allocation of benefits under the TDRA is different if the claiming employee owns or rents a home. In the circumstances of this case, the Respondent arrived at the conclusion that the Complainant rented his home in Nova Scotia and, therefore, was ineligible for the TDRA benefits in subsections 2.11 through 2.18 of the 1993 Relocation Directive. Mr. Gauthier recognized that the Complainant was however covered by subsection 3.2.1, which would have allowed the Complainant to claim a monthly payment of $420 per month.\n[65] When asked to indicate a precise reference in the 1993 Relocation Directive that would support his interpretation of a distinction between renters and owners, Mr. Gauthier was unable to do so. Therefore, it would appear that his interpretation of the 1993 Relocation Directive is not supported by its actual language.\n[66] On more than one occasion, Mr. Gauthier\u2019s testimony also emphasized the fact that the 1993 Relocation Directive prioritized the efficient use of public resources. However, he was silent as to the other purpose of the 1993 Relocation Directive, of having a minimum detrimental effect on the transferred employee and family.\n[67] Overall, I did not find Mr. Gauthier\u2019s testimony particularly persuasive or useful in understanding the Respondent\u2019s assertion that its interpretation and application of the 1993 Relocation Directive in the Complainant\u2019s circumstances was a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[68] Furthermore, no explanation was advanced by the Respondent, either through its witness or otherwise, as to how an interpretation of the 1993 Relocation Directive that included the circumstances of the Complainant\u2019s family in relation to his need to maintain dual residences would have caused the Respondent undue hardship. In fact, given that the Relocation Directive currently in effect now defines a dependant to include persons who reside outside the employee\u2019s residence, it may have been difficult for the Respondent to do so.\n[69] Nor do I find relevant the fact that the 1993 Relocation Directive was a negotiated policy between the National Joint Council and the Respondent, and that it is considered a part of the Complainant\u2019s collective agreement. The Act is not negotiable and must be respected despite what a collective agreement may provide.\n[70] The standard for establishing a bona fide occupational requirement and undue hardship was succinctly summarized by the Tribunal in Johnstone v. Canada Border Service Agency, 2010 CHRT 20:\n[348] In Meiorin the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that the duty of employers to accommodate is a fundamental legal obligation. An employer must demonstrate that the discrimination is necessary to achieve legitimate work-related objectives and tender affirmative evidence that the point of undue hardship has been reach in its efforts to accommodate the employee.\n[349] Also in Meiorin, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that \"[u]nless no further accommodation is possible without imposing undue hardship, the standard is not a BFOR in its existing form and the prima facie case of discrimination stands\".\n[350] In Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail Canada Inc., [2007] S.C.J. No. 15 (Via Rail) the Supreme Court of Canada stated that \"undue hardship is reached when reasonable measures of accommodation are exhausted and only unreasonable or impracticable options for accommodation remain\".\n[351] These cases very apparently set out a duty on the part of CBSA to make a real effort to accommodate, an effort that is tangible and measurable, and tests out the employer's ability to meet the accommodation request. CBSA must not base its assessment of whether an employee needs accommodation, or of whether it can implement accommodation measures, based on \"impressionistic assumptions.\"\n[71] No legitimate work-related objective or affirmative evidence to the point of undue hardship was advanced by the Respondent to justify its prima facie discrimination in this case. The Respondent\u2019s assumption justifying its policy in this case, that family members residing in their own homes do not need employees to maintain their former homes for them, clearly did not take into account family circumstances such as the Complainant\u2019s. Furthermore, the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the Complainant\u2019s family circumstances arose because of a \u201cvoluntary separation of the family for personal reasons\u201d and that the \u201cTDRA is not intended to facilitate medical and other care giving arrangements for family members\u201d ignores the duties and obligations within the Complainant\u2019s family and which are protected by the ground of family status under the Act. The Respondent\u2019s position also contradicts the purpose of the 1993 Relocation Directive of minimizing the detrimental effects of relocation on a transferred employee and family.\n[72] Therefore, based on the evidence presented and the analysis above, I find the Respondent has not established a bona fide justification for its prima facie discrimination towards the Complainant. As a result, I find the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, pursuant to subsection 7(b) of the Act, on the basis of the Complainant\u2019s family status.\nV. Conclusion [73] For the reasons above, this Tribunal finds the present complaint to be substantiated:\n(1) the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination within the meaning of subsection 7(b) of the Act, on the basis of his family status; and,\n(2) the Respondent has failed to establish a bona fide occupational requirement, present a reasonable explanation for, or otherwise justify the prima facie case of discrimination against it.\nVI. Remedy [74] Pursuant to subsection 53(2) of the Act, if at the conclusion of an inquiry the Tribunal finds a complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal can make an order against the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice. In this case, the Complainant seeks an order with the following remedies: reimbursement of his claim under the TDRA; compensation for pain and suffering; compensation for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly; and, interest.\n[75] The aim in making an order under subsection 53(2) is not to punish the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice, but to eliminate - as much as possible - the discriminatory effects of the practice (see Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board), [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at para. 13). To accomplish this, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised on a principled basis, considering the link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268 at para. 37). In other words, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial discretion must be exercised reasonably, in consideration of the particular circumstances of the case and the evidence presented (Hughes v. Elections Canada, 2010 CHRT 4 at para. 50).\nA. Claim for TDRA (i) Issue estoppel motion [76] Prior to the commencement of the hearing of this complaint, the Complainant brought a motion for an order declaring that issue estoppel applies to the quantum of the TDRA claimed by him and that the proper amount of the TDRA at issue in this matter is $21,427.\n[77] As part of the adjudication of his grievance before the PSLRB, both parties jointly submitted a Statement of Agreed Facts, which provided:\n\u201c... Mr. Hicks explained on his claim that the reason for claiming TDRA is because his wife had to stay in Sydney, NS to take care of his mother in law that could not be moved at the time of the relocation ... For his mother in law he is requesting 12 months (21 247$) of TDRA ...\u201d\n[78] According to the Complainant, while the PSLRB dismissed his grievance, at no point during the course of the adjudication did the Respondent or the adjudicator raise an issue regarding the quantum of the TDRA claimed. In fact, the Complainant argues the Respondent explicitly conceded that the TDRA quantum at issue was $21,247, as set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts.\n[79] The Complainant submits that issue estoppel should apply in this case because there has been a previous adjudication between the same parties, on the issue of whether the TDRA claim should be granted. The Complainant argues that issue estoppel extends to material facts that were necessarily (even if not explicitly) determined in the earlier proceedings. The Complainant adds, the dispute over his application for TDRA has been litigated for years between the same parties, but it is only now before the Tribunal that the Respondent disputes the issue of the quantum of his claim. If the Respondent intended to challenge the quantum of his TDRA claim, the Complainant says it should have done so when he made his application or during the grievance process.\n[80] In response, the Respondent states issue estoppel applies only in circumstances where it is clear from the facts that the legal or factual question in issue between the same parties has already been decided. According to the Respondent, the nature and amount of the expenses submitted by the Complainant under the TDRA was never addressed or adjudicated upon in previous litigation between the parties. In the Statement of Agreed Facts before the PSRLB, while the Respondent agreed that the Complainant had submitted a TDRA claim in the amount of $21,247, it otherwise claims to have agreed to nothing else. As the PSRLB denied the TDRA claim on the ground that the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law did not qualify as a dependant, the Respondent submits the PSLRB did not decide the issue of whether the alleged expenses were actually incurred and, if so, whether they otherwise qualified for reimbursement under the TDRA.\n[81] Both parties agree on the rationale for the doctrine of issue estoppel as clearly explained in Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 SCC 44 [Danyluk]:\nA litigant, to use the vernacular is only entitled to one bite at the cherry ... An issue, once decided, should not generally be re-litigated to the benefit of the losing party and the harassment of the winner. A person should only be vexed once in the same cause.\n(Danyluk at para. 18)\n[82] Both parties also agree on the three preconditions to the operation of issue estoppel, as outlined in Danyluk:\n(1) that the same question has been decided;\n(2) that the judicial decision which is said to create the estoppel was final; and,\n(3) that the parties to the judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.\n(Danyluk at para. 25)\n[83] The only previous litigation between the parties on the issue of the Complainant\u2019s entitlements under the TDRA resulted in a decision by the PSLRB.\n[84] However, in its decision, the PSLRB did not cover the issue of the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s claim for TDRA.\n[85] Rather, as the PSRLB found that it did not have the jurisdiction to address the Complainant\u2019s human rights arguments, it rendered its decision based on the definition of \u201cdependant\u201d in the 1993 Relocation Directive. Based on that definition, the PSLRB determined the Complainant was not entitled to TDRA at all.\n[86] The PSLRB\u2019s decision is consistent with the Respondent\u2019s position to the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim. Throughout the grievance process, the Respondent maintained a position that the Complainant was not entitled to any TDRA. On this basis, it even refused to attempt to mediate the issue because it maintained it had nothing to give the Complainant. As is also clear from Mr. Gauthier\u2019s testimony, even if the Complainant\u2019s mother-in-law qualified as a dependant, the Respondent has its own view and interpretation of what expenses the Complainant can claim.\n[87] For these reasons, in my view, the question of the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim has not been previously decided by the PSRLB. The Complainant\u2019s argument for issue estoppel therefore fails under the first precondition to the operation of issue estoppel, as outlined in Danyluk. It would be unfair if the Respondent was unable to defend itself against the Complainant\u2019s claimed expenses under the TDRA. The Respondent has the right to question each one of the elements of the Complainant\u2019s claim and verify their validity.\n[88] Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s motion for an order declaring that issue estoppel applies to the issue of the quantum of the TDRA claimed by him and that the proper amount of the TDRA at issue in this matter is $21,427 is dismissed.\n(ii) Compensation [89] Pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, a victim of discrimination is entitled to compensation for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. But for the discriminatory practice, the Complainant would have been reimbursed some of his expenses under the TDRA.\n[90] However, the parties disagree on the interpretation of the TDRA and, specifically, the expenses the Complainant can claim. The Respondent claims there is a distinction between the amounts that can be claimed by renters as opposed to owners. While I was unable to find support in the actual language of the 1993 Relocation Directive for this distinction, I also do not feel as though I have sufficient information to be able to make an informed decision on the interpretation and application of the TDRA and to determine the actual quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim.\n[91] Given this lack of information, my decision on the estoppel issue above, and the fact that the Respondent was previously unwilling to offer the Complainant anything in relation to his TDRA claim, I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim. I will retain jurisdiction in the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement in this regard.\nB. Compensation for pain and suffering [92] The Complainant seeks $20,000 in compensation for pain and suffering under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act. This is the maximum amount of compensation the Tribunal can award for pain and suffering. The Tribunal only awards the maximum amount in the most egregious of circumstances: where the extent and duration of the complainant\u2019s suffering as a result of the discriminatory practice warrants the full amount.\n[93] The Complainant explained that he had been under stress and had been experiencing frustration with his employer for his transfer from Sydney to Ottawa for a long period of time. He alleged he started having physical problems: not being able to sleep, digestion problems, and heart murmurs. His doctor thought it was from all the stress. He had to take medical tests and was advised to take time off. He states he arrived in Ottawa in the fall of 2002 and that his medical problems started then and increased in the summer of 2003. He then had to take sick leave of about 40 days, ending the first of the month of September 2003.\n[94] The Complainant claims his stress was caused by the unsettled nature of his problem with his employer, and the ongoing struggle he had to resolve this problem, including filling a series of grievances with his employer.\n[95] The Complainant deplored the fact that during his ordeal he never felt his employer was trying to help him out; it did not show any willingness to inquire and engage with him with regard to how to deal with his family obligations; and, therefore, he felt abandoned by the Respondent, his employer.\n[96] That said, no medical report was filed before this Tribunal. However, the Complainant indicated that the Respondent authorized his sick leave, which information was not denied by the Respondent. Nor did the Respondent raise an objection or make submissions regarding the Complainant\u2019s health during the hearing.\n[97] The Respondent does note, however, that the Complainant had many other disputes with the Respondent in respect of his relocation, aside from the denial of his application for financial assistance under the TDRA. According to the Respondent, while the Complainant testified that he suffered disappointment, frustration and stress as a result of dealing with his various disputes with the Respondent in respect of his relocation, he was unable to describe how much of this was attributable to the Respondent\u2019s denial of his application for financial assistance under the TDRA.\n[98] Taking into account the submissions of the parties above, and the circumstances of this case, I award the Complainant $15,000 for the pain and suffering he experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nC. Compensation for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly [99] The Complainant seeks $20,000 as compensation from the Respondent for having engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly, pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the Act.\n[100] In Johnstone, the Federal Court stated the following with regard to subsection 53(3) of the Act:\nThis is a punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate. A finding of wilfulness requires the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional. Recklessness usually denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly.\n(Johnstone at para. 154)\n[101] As $20,000 is the maximum amount that can be awarded under subsection 53(3) of the Act, the maximum award should be reserved for the very worst cases.\n[102] According to the Complainant, the Respondent failed to treat his claim with the seriousness that it deserved. The Complainant discussed his relocation and his claim for TDRA several times with representatives for the Respondent and informed them of the reasons that his mother-in-law was unable to live with his family. The Complainant claims the Respondent did not even inquire into his needs in relation to his mother-in-law, in light of her serious health issues and disabilities, in its application of the 1993 Relocation Directive to his TDRA claim.\n[103] The Complainant submits he was thorough and diligent in his efforts to have his mother-in-law recognized as a dependant, and based his arguments on human rights principles, yet the Respondent failed to consider his position and simply mechanically applied a rigid definition that was discriminatory. In this regard, the Complainant claims the Respondent acted recklessly as to whether its TDRA policy resulted in discrimination and whether accommodation should be considered.\n[104] The Respondent notes that its denial of the Complainant\u2019s application for financial assistance under the TDRA was upheld at every grievance level, including the PSLRB, which also noted why the denial was appropriate for reasons other than those advanced by the Complainant in his grievance. According to the Respondent, the fact that it disagreed with the Complainant regarding whether its denial of his application for TDRA raised a human rights issue does not constitute a basis for awarding special compensation.\n[105] The evidence indicates that the Respondent followed a strict application of the text of the 1993 Relocation Directive. During the hearing, I was left with the impression that, in the Respondent\u2019s mind, any deviation from the text of the 1993 Relocation Directive was unimaginable. Nor was there evidence to indicate that the Respondent considered the Act in following such a rigid application of the 1993 Relocation Directive. When faced with a difficult family situation and a request for compassion, there is no indication that the Respondent considered its duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship. Overall, the Respondent showed disregard and indifference for the Complainant\u2019s family status and for the consequences that its decision to deny the TDRA would have in this regard.\n[106] For all these reasons, and pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the Act, this Tribunal awards the Complainant $20,000 for the Respondent\u2019s reckless discriminatory practice.\nD. Interest [107] Pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the Act, an order to pay compensation may include an award of interest at a rate and for a period that the member considers appropriate. Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) provides that, unless the Panel order otherwise, any award of interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank of Canada Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada; and, shall accrue from the date on which the discriminatory practice occurred, until the date of payment of the award of compensation.\n[108] The Complainant requests compound interest to be awarded on all of the amounts sought. In his view, given that many years have elapsed since the human rights complaint was filed, a failure to award compound interest would reward the Respondent for the delays incurred.\n[109] Relying on the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Chopra v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 2004 CHRT 27, the Respondent submits that compound interest is warranted only if it can be deduced from the evidence or circumstances of the case that it is required to cover the loss in issue. Aside from the long period between when the Complainant submitted his complaint to the Commission (September 2006), and the date his complaint was heard by the Tribunal (April 2013), the Respondent submits there are no circumstances in this case to distinguish it from any other complaint that typically comes before the Tribunal. According to the Respondent, unless the delay can be attributed to it, which it denies, there are no special circumstances that would result in the Complainant not being fully compensated through the payment of simple interest.\n[110] While the Complainant requests compound interest for the delay incurred between the filling and hearing of his complaint, there is no indication that these delays were as a result of the Respondent. Therefore, I see no reason to deviate from Rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04).\n[111] As a result, I award interest on the compensation granted under paragraph 53(2)(e) and subsection 53(3) above. The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank of Canada Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada; and, shall accrue from November 23, 2004, the date the Complainant\u2019s application for TDRA was denied, until the date of payment of the award of compensation.\n[112] In working out the details of the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim as directed above, the parties should also factor in an award of interest pursuant to the instructions in paragraph 111 above.\nE. Retention of Jurisdiction [113] Given that I have left it to the parties to first attempt to work out the details of the quantum of the Complainant\u2019s TDRA claim, I will retain jurisdiction for three (3) months from the date of this decision in the event the parties are unable to reach an agreement. In that situation, I would ask the Complainant to provide the Tribunal with written submissions explaining the basis of the disagreement and providing its position thereon, with supporting documentation. Within two (2) weeks of receiving the Complainant\u2019s written submissions, the Respondent can provide a response. Within one (1) week of receiving the Respondent\u2019s written submissions, the Complainant can provide a reply.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 18, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1751\/10611\nStyle of Cause: Leslie Hicks v.

Conclusion. 42\nI. Introduction & Historical Context [1] Indian status is a legal construct created by the federal government. Through various provisions of the Indian Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. I-5 [the Indian Act] and its prior enactments, the federal government has defined the persons who are entitled to registration as \u201cIndian\u201d. The statutory concept of \u201cIndian\u201d from early colonialism to the present day does not reflect the traditional or current customs of First Nations peoples for defining their social organization and its membership (see McIvor v. The Registrar, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2007 BCSC 827 at paras. 8-12 [McIvor]).\n[2] Prior to 1985, in defining who was and who was not entitled to registration as \u201cIndian\u201d, previous enactments of the Indian Act also provided for situations where an \u201cIndian\u201d could be enfranchised from entitlement to registration, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. \u201cEnfranchisement\u201d was one of the key mechanisms by which the federal government sought to achieve the goal of assimilating First Nations people to the rest of Canadian society. The term refers to a number of statutory mechanisms that existed in the Indian Act, in varying forms, at all material times up to 1985. Generally speaking, enfranchisement was a process by which the federal government stripped an Indian, all of his or her minor unmarried children and future descendants of Indian status and band membership in exchange for incentives and various entitlements under the Indian act and otherwise, depending on the mechanisms in force at the time of enfranchisement. At different times, these incentives included such things as Canadian citizenship, the right to vote in Canadian elections, rights to hold life and\/or fee simple estates in reserve lands, or per capita shares of funds held on behalf of the First Nation. In 1985, the provisions of the Indian Act that allowed for enfranchisement were repealed.\n[3] Canada\u2019s Indian enfranchisement policy exemplifies well the dissonance between the statutory definition of \u201cIndian\u201d and First Nations peoples\u2019 perspective on defining their identity. The Supreme Court of Canada has noted the disadvantage, stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination associated with the enfranchisement provisions of the Indian Act. As L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dube J. wrote in Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 203 [Corbiere] at para. 88 \u201cThe enfranchisement provisions of the Indian Act were designed to encourage Aboriginal people to renounce their heritage and identity, and to force them to do so if they wished to take a full part in Canadian society\u201d. She further noted that the application of the provisions had helped to create a population of former Indians living off reserve, who were subjected to discriminatory assumptions that they were somehow \u201cless Aboriginal\u201d than others who had remained on reserve: Corbiere at paras. 83-92. Writing for the majority, McLachlin J. (as she then was) also found that to assume that an Aboriginal person off-reserve is not interested in preserving their cultural identity is to engage in discriminatory stereotyping: Corbiere, supra at para. 18. In a recent decision issued in July of 2012, a unanimous Federal Court of Appeal had the following to say about the process of enfranchisement by application under the former s. 108(1) of the Indian Act:\nEnfranchisement' is a euphemism for one of the most oppressive policies adopted by the Canadian government in its history of dealings with Aboriginal peoples: Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples: Looking Forward, Looking Backward, vol. 1 (Ottawa: Canada Communication Group Publishing, 1996) at page 271.\nBeginning in 1857 and evolving into different forms until 1985, 'enfranchisement' was aimed at assimilating Aboriginal peoples and eradicating their culture or, in the words of the 1857 Act, encouraging 'the progress of [c]ivilization' among Aboriginal peoples...\nUnder one form of 'enfranchisement' - the form at issue in this case \u2013 Aboriginal peoples received Canadian citizenship and the right to hold land in fee simple. In return, they had to renounce - on behalf of themselves and all their descendants, living and future - their legal recognition as an 'Indian', their tax exemption, their membership in their Aboriginal community, their right to reside in that community, and their right to vote for their leaders in that community.\nThe Supreme Court has noted the disadvantage, stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination associated with 'enfranchisement': Corbiere ... With deep reluctance or at high personal cost, and sometimes under compulsion, many spent decades cut off from communities to which they had a deep cultural and spiritual bond.\nCanada (Attorney General) v. Larkman, 2012 FCA 204 at paras. 10-13\nThe Ontario Court of Appeal previously made similar comments in a case involving an enfranchisement by application, stating that, \"The purpose of enfranchisement was to facilitate the federal government's attempts to assimilate Aboriginal peoples into the mainstream population\", and endorsing the same passage from the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, describing enfranchisement as being amongst the most oppressive practices in the history of the Indian Act: Etches v. Canada (Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 ONCA 182 at para. 1.\n[4] As part of these proceedings, John F. Leslie Ph.D testified and prepared an expert report entitled Indian Enfranchisement Policy in Canada: 1867 to 1951. Excerpts from this report demonstrate the government\u2019s objective behind the previous enfranchisement provisions of the Indian Act:\n\u2022 \" ... the time has come for facilitating the enfranchisement of a great number of those Indians who, by their education and knowledge of business, their intelligence and their good conduct, are as well qualified as whites to enjoy civil rights, and to be released from a state of tutelage\" (Canada, Annual Report of the Secretary of State for the Year ended 30 June 1868, at pp. 1-2; cited at p. 3 of Dr. Leslie's report);\n\u2022 \"To grant enfranchisement to the intelligent and well-behaved Indians would probably train them to still further self-reliance, and encourage their brethren who are lagging behind to make greater exertions to overtake the Anglo-Saxon in the race of progress\" (Canada, Annual Report of the Department of the Interior for the Year ended 30 June 1874, at pp. 5-6; cited at pp. 4-5 of Dr. Leslie's report);\n\u2022 \" ... the true interests of the aborigines and of the State alike require that every effort should be made to aid the red man in lifting himself out of his condition of tutelage and dependence, and that it is clearly our wisdom and our duty, through education and every other means, to prepare him for a higher civilization by encouraging him to assume the privileges and responsibilities of true citizenship\" (Canada, Annual Report of the Department of the Interior for the Year elided 30 June 1875, at p. xiii; cited on p. 5 of Dr. Leslie's report);\n\u2022 \"I want to get rid of the Indian problem. I do not think as a matter of fact, that the country ought to continuously protect a class of people who are able to stand alone...Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic and there is no Indian question, and no Indian Department, and that is the whole object of this Bill\" (Duncan Campbell Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, 1919, quoted in John L. Taylor, Canadian Indian Policy During the Inter-War Years, 1981-1939 at p. 147; cited on p. 17 of Dr Leslie's report);\n\u2022 \"In the long path that must be followed in bringing the Indian from a primitive, uncivilized state to one of self-reliance and self-support, the latter is the objective kept in view throughout.\nIt is inevitable that at the beginning assistance, advice and direction must be given and restraint applied. Obviously all these should disappear upon the attainment of the desired status by the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s or wards of the government\n[...]\nThe Indian communities, instead of progressing, stand still or even retrogress: not only that, but they have a deteriorating effect upon surrounding white communities and form an obstruction to the country's progress as a whole.\" (Dr. Harold McGill, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, 1933, \u201cNotes on the enfranchisement of Indians\u201d; cited on p. 20 of Dr. Leslie's report).\n[5] In my view, in the human rights context in particular, Justice not only seeks to rectify the violation of a person\u2019s rights, but should also endeavour to heal any suffering a person has endured as a result of unjust treatment. A fundamental component of healing is the recognition of suffering. The recognition of the hurt an individual or group has endured may address their need for justice, speed up the healing process, enhance feelings of self-value and promote respect for human dignity. While the judicial sphere often speaks in terms of what is legal or illegal, human values of what is right or wrong frequently transcend beyond formal legalities and may not always be encompassed in the current state of the law. In my view, the enfranchisement policies and practices encompassed in the Indian Act were completely contrary to human rights principles and values.\n[6] I acknowledge the suffering created by the government\u2019s previous enfranchisement policies and practices on the First Nations people of Canada, including the Complainant, Roger William Andrews, and his family.\n[7] It is within the historical context of enfranchisement that the Complainant brings the present complaints.\nII. Complaints [8] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) has requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) inquire into two complaints filed by the Complainant.\n[9] In his first complaint, filed on or around October 20, 2008, the Complainant, on behalf of his daughter Michelle Dominique Andrews, claims Indian and Northern Affairs Canada [INAC], the Respondent, engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], when it denied his daughter\u2019s application for Indian status under the Indian Act [the first complaint].\n[10] In his second complaint, filed on or around February 1, 2010, the Complainant also claims the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5 of the Act when it granted his own application for Indian status under subsection 6(2) rather than subsection 6(1) of the Indian Act [the second complaint].\n[11] The essence of the complaints, as described by the parties in their Agreed Statement of Facts, is that the Complainant challenges the registration provisions in section 6 of the Indian Act as discriminatory on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin and family status.\n[12] The complaints were consolidated for the purpose of a single hearing (see Roger William Andrews v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2011 CHRT 22), which was held from October 15-19, October 22-26, and November 7-9, 2012, in Surrey, British Columbia.\nIII. Background [13] The Complainant\u2019s father, Andrew Joseph, was recorded from birth as being a member of the Naotkamegwanning First Nation, also known as the Whitefish Bay Indian Band, and, therefore, was an Indian under paragraph 2(d)(i) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98.\n[14] His father married Isabella McCafferty, who had no aboriginal ancestry, but who became an Indian under paragraph 2(d)(iii) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1927, c. 98, upon her marriage to Andrew Joseph. The two had a daughter, Jessie Joseph, on December 22, 1955. At that time, Jessie Joseph was entitled to registration as an Indian and was a member of the Naotkamegwanning Indian by virtue of her father.\n[15] By written application dated January 8, 1957, Andrew Joseph applied for enfranchisement pursuant to subsection 108(1) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149. Through enfranchisement, Andrew Joseph, his wife and unmarried child, would cease being Indians pursuant to the Indian Act in exchange for various incentives.\n[16] By Order in Council dated March 21, 1957, Mr. Joseph was enfranchised, along with his wife, Isabella Joseph (n\u00e9e McCafferty), and their daughter, Jessie Joseph. As a result, all three individuals ceased to be Indians within the meaning of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, s. 109, and as amended by R.S.C. 1956, c. 40, s. 27; and their names were removed from the Indian Register and from the membership list of the Indian Band.\n[17] The Complainant was born in 1958. His mother, Marie Holden, is not and never was entitled to registration as an Indian under the Indian Act. As a result of his father\u2019s enfranchisement in 1957, when the Complainant was born, he was not entitled to registration as an Indian under the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149. If the Complainant\u2019s father had not enfranchised, the Complainant would have been entitled at birth to registration under paragraph 11(1)(c) of the Indian Act, R.S.C. 1952, c. 149, as a male person who is a direct descendant in the male line of a male band member.\n[18] The Complainant married Georgina Maltzan in 1976, who is not and never was entitled to registration as an Indian under the Indian Act. They have two daughters: Cheryl Andrews, born May 9, 1983; and, Michelle Andrews, born December 4, 1986.\n[19] In 1985, the provisions of the Indian Act that allowed for enfranchisement were repealed. The Indian Act was also amended to reinstate entitlements to registration for those who had previously been enfranchised. Specifically, paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Indian Act created entitlement to registration for persons who were named in an Order in Council issued pursuant to the former enfranchisement provisions. However, section 7 also provided that a person was not entitled to be registered if, generally, they (i) had no claim to Indian status by virtue of their own ancestry, (ii) previously gained status before 1985 by marrying an Indian man, and (iii) lost that status before 1985 by virtue of an application for enfranchisement.\n[20] In 1985, the coming into force of Bill C-31, resulted in significant amendments to the registration provisions of the Indian Act. Since that time, it has been sections 6(1) and 6(2) of the Indian Act that describe the various persons who are entitled to be registered in the Indian Register. The amendments also introduced the current formulation of what is commonly known as the \u201csecond generation cut-off rule\u201d. This rule operates so as to cut off eligibility for registration upon the second consecutive generation of parenting with a person who is not an Indian. The second generation cut-off rule functions as follows:\n\u2022 6(1) has child with 6(1) = 6(1) child\n\u2022 6(1) has child with 6(2) = 6(1) child\n\u2022 6(2) has child with 6(2) = 6(1) child\n\u2022 6(1) has child with non-Indian = 6(2) child\n\u2022 6(2) has child with non-Indian = non-Indian child\n[21] Prior to the 1985 amendments to the Indian Act, Indian status was based almost entirely upon having a patrilineal connection to an Indian man. For example, the children of Indian men who married non-Indian women received Indian status; however, the children of Indian women who had married non-Indian men were denied status. The second generation cut-off rule was introduced in an attempt to establish equality of women and men using and to create a gender-neutral standard for Indian status entitlement. As outlined above, the status of children is now assessed based on an examination of both parents, not just the father.\n[22] As a result of the 1985 amendments, the Complainant\u2019s father, Andrew Joseph, and half-sister, Jessie Joseph, became eligible for registration under paragraph 6(1)(d) of the Indian Act. Isabella Joseph (n\u00e9e McCafferty), whose former status flowed solely from her marriage to Andrew Joseph, did not regain status given the application of section 7 of the Indian Act. The Complainant became eligible for registration under subsection 6(2), as he was the child of one person eligible under subsection 6(1) (Andrew Joseph) and one non-Indian (Marie Holden). The Complainant was not himself eligible for registration under paragraph 6(1)(d) as his name did not appear in the enfranchisement order as he was born after his father\u2019s enfranchisement.\n[23] On July 29, 2004, the Complainant applied for registration as an Indian under the Indian Act. His application was supported by various documents outlining the Complainant\u2019s background and family history. On August 21, 2006, the Office of the Indian Registrar notified the Complainant that he was registered as an Indian under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act and as a member of the Naotkamegwanning Band in accordance with paragraph 11(2)(b).\n[24] On October 19, 2006, the Complainant submitted an application for registration as an Indian under the Indian Act on behalf of his daughter, Michelle Andrews. This application provided information about Michelle Andrews\u2019 father (the Complainant), but no information about the identity of Michelle Andrews\u2019 mother (Georgina Maltzan). On March 20, 2007, the Office of the Indian Registrar notified Michelle Andrews that, since one of her parents (her father Roger Andrews) was entitled to be registered under section 6(2) and since no information had been provided about her mother, there was no provision in the Indian Act which would permit entry of her name in the Indian Register.\n[25] On March 30, 2009, the Complainant submitted a protest to the Office of the Indian Registrar, pursuant to section 14.2 of the Indian Act, in which he voiced his wish to appeal, among other things, the decision to register him under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act, rather than under some provision of subsection 6(1); and, the decision that Michelle Andrews was not eligible for registration.\n[26] On June 4, 2010, the Office of the Indian Registrar wrote a letter to Mr. Andrews explaining the legislative provisions and explaining how they operated so as to enable him to be eligible for registration under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act, but not under any provision of subsection 6(1). The letter also explained that since the Complainant had not provided any new information and since he had not provided any new arguments as to how the information already supplied should be analysed, his letter could not be accepted as a valid protest.\n[27] As for his daughter, Michelle Andrews, the June 4, 2010 letter explained that, since she was an adult, she needed to provide her own letter of protest. At the time of this complaint, Michelle Andrews had not submitted a protest in respect of the decision made by the Office of the Indian Registrar regarding her application for registration.\nIV. Positions of the Parties A. The Complainant [28] According to the Complainant, given his status under subsection 6(2) and his daughter\u2019s denial of status, the present day version of the Indian Act continues the discriminatory effects of the previous enfranchisement provisions of the Indian Act. He submits that, while the 1985 amendments to the Indian Act partly reversed the effects of enfranchisement, people like himself and his daughter still endure the discriminatory effects of the enfranchisement of their relatives.\n[29] Had his father not enfranchised, the Complainant submits he would have been entitled to registration pursuant to any of the versions of the Indian Act pre-1985; and, to subsection 6(1) status under the current version of the Indian Act. With subsection 6(1) status, the Complainant would then be able to pass 6(2) status along to his daughter, Michelle Andrews.\n[30] The Complainant notes that while the 1985 amendments to the Indian Act were done in an attempt to alleviate gender discrimination and the discrimination of enfranchisement, the government was not successful in removing these forms of discrimination. According to the Complainant, this is evident by examining his and his daughter\u2019s current circumstances with regard to Indian status, and the finding of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in\nMcIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153 [McIvor]. In McIvor, the Court found that paragraphs 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act violated the right to equality under section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and were not justified under section 1 of that same legislation. In sum, the Court found that certain aspects of the Indian Act\u2019s registration scheme continued to discriminate between the descendants of Indian men and women, despite the 1985 amendments to correct such inequality.\n[31] The Complainant also notes that, when considering the amendments to the Indian Act prior to those that occurred in 1985, the government had first thought of extending status to those persons with a \u00bc Indian heritage. In the Complainant\u2019s view, if that standard had been adopted instead of the current regime, it would have allowed for one more generation of status Indians, which would have included himself and his daughter. Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 [Moore], the Complainant claims the Respondent failed to appropriately consider this alternative to the current registration provisions of the Indian Act; or, how the current provisions differentiate between siblings of the same family affected by enfranchisement. Therefore, as the registration provisions of the Indian Act currently stand, the Complainant submits that the regime is still discriminatory.\nB. The Commission [32] According to the Commission, the previous enfranchisement provisions of the Indian Act were based on colonial assumptions that Aboriginal peoples would, over time, abandon their traditional cultures and ways of life, and be absorbed into \u201ccivilized\u201d Euro-Canadian society. These assumptions, and the government\u2019s policy of encouraging enfranchisement, were oppressive, assimilationist, and racially discriminatory. The Commission argues that the registration provisions of the Indian Act are inconsistent with the requirements of the Act, insofar as they continue to allow the current entitlements of Roger and Michelle Andrews to be negatively affected by the past enfranchisement of Andrew Joseph.\n[33] The basis for the Commission\u2019s argument is that the Act allows for complaints challenging the discriminatory impact of other federal laws. According to the Commission, Supreme Court of Canada case law states that, barring express statutory language to the contrary, human rights legislation has primacy over other legislation and renders inconsistent laws inoperable.\n[34] In this regard, the Commission claims the record of these proceedings establishes a prima facie case of discrimination: registration as an Indian is a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of section 5 of the Act; the Complainant and his daughter have either been (i) denied this service or (ii) been subjected to adverse differentiation with respect to this service; and, the denial or adverse differentiation is linked to the prohibited grounds of race and\/or family status.\n[35] The Commission submits that the Respondent, in responding to this prima facie case of discrimination, has failed to satisfy it onus of proving a bona fide justification for the discrimination. According to the Commission, the Respondent has not proven that\n(i) due consideration has been given to the circumstances of persons in the situations of the Complainant and his daughter; or, (ii) that it would cause undue hardship to eradicate the impugned denial or adverse differentiation by extending subsection 6(1) status to Mr. Andrews and subsection 6(2) status to his daughter. In this regard, the Commission submits the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Moore confirms that, without proof of giving serious consideration to accommodating the circumstances of persons in the situation of the Complainant and his daughter, any claim to justify the registration provisions of the Indian Act cannot succeed.\nC. The Respondent [36] According to the Respondent, these complaints are directed solely at an Act of Parliament and nothing else. As a result, the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s reasoning in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 FCA 7 [Murphy], which found that a complaint directed against an act of Parliament fell outside the jurisdiction of the Act, would dictate that the complaint should be dismissed. The Respondent argues the Murphy decision is directly on point and binding on the Tribunal, and it is not open to the Tribunal to overturn a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal. In the Respondent\u2019s view, as the Complainant seeks to challenge section 6 of the Indian Act, he should be filing a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms challenge in a court of law.\n[37] In the alternative, the Respondent raises many other arguments as to why these complaints cannot form the basis of a prima facie case of discrimination, including: (1) the Complainant is trying to re-invigorate the male bias that existed in the Indian Act prior to 1985; (2) the complaint is based on an impermissible retrospective application of the Act to an event, the enfranchisement of Andrew Joseph, that occurred 20 years prior to the coming into force of the Act; (3) the grounds of family status, race or ethnic origin are not implicated by these complaints; (4) the Complainant cannot rely on the alleged discriminatory treatment of someone else (their grandparent) to substantiate his own claim of discrimination; and, (5) the complaints require an element of \u201carbitrariness\u201d or \u201cstereotyping\u201d and not simply a distinction based on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[38] In the further alternative, if a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the Respondent submits it is justified pursuant to paragraph 15(1)(g) and subsection 15(2) of the Act. According to the Respondent, the 1985 amendments to the Indian Act were the product of over fifteen years of consultation with aboriginal peoples, study by Parliamentary Committees and development by government. Parliament amended the former gender-biased legislation and balanced the interests of all those affected by the legislation, thereby achieving the current gender-neutral registration provisions. Deviating from the gender neutral provisions by adopting and reinvigorating the male bias of the former Indian Act would constitute undue hardship. Likewise, the Respondent submits that deviating from the genealogical standard employed by section 6 of the Indian Act, to encompass a third or fourth generation of persons with mixed parentage as suggested by the Complainant, would also constitute undue hardship.\n[39] That said, as subsection 15(2) of the Act only allows undue hardship to be established on the basis of health, safety and\/or cost, the Respondent argues that to justify a prima facie case of discrimination in this matter the term \u201ccost\u201d should include \u201csocial\u201d cost, and not simply financial cost. Otherwise, the Respondent claims it would be put in the position of having to advance a justification based solely on financial undue hardship. According to the Respondent, it is loathe to pursue a solely financial justification for the registration provisions of the Indian Act given its reductive, dehumanizing nature, and the fact that non-monetary factors were important and powerful considerations in crafting those provisions. In this regard, the Respondent notes that an analysis under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, instead of under the Act, would be a more conducive analysis for taking into account the social considerations that went into the registration provisions of the Indian Act.\nV. Issues [40] The present complaints are brought pursuant to section 5 of the Act, which provides:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[41] Given section 5 and the positions of the parties outlined above, the issues in this case can be framed as follows:\nA. Do the complaints involve the provision of services customarily available to the general public within the meaning of section 5 of the Act; or, are the complaints solely a challenge to legislation?\nB. If the complaints are solely a challenge to legislation, does the Act allow for such complaints?\n[42] If the complaints involve the provision of services, or if the Act allows for complaints that challenge legislation, then the remaining issues to address would be:\nA. Has the Complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination?\nB. If so, has the Respondent demonstrated that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act?\nVI. Analysis A. Do the complaints involve the provision of services customarily available to the general public within the meaning of section 5 of the Act; or, are the complaints solely a challenge to legislation? Parties\u2019 positions\n[43] The Complainant views Indian registration as a \u201cservice\u201d. According to the Complainant, Service Canada lists Indian Registration and Band Lists as services on its website. Therefore, in the Complainant\u2019s view, Indian registration can be seen to provide a benefit or assistance to first nations. The Complainant adds, the benefits that Indian registration provides are inextricably linked to that registration and are services themselves (for example, health care, right to access land and hunting and fishing rights).\n[44] The Commission also views Indian registration as a \u201cservice\u201d for the purposes of section 5 of the Act. First, it claims the wording and legislative history of the former section 67 of the Act shows Parliament\u2019s intent and understanding that, in the absence of a specific legislative statement to the contrary, the Act will apply to the registration provisions of the\nIndian Act. According to the Commission, the only way to give effect to Parliament\u2019s intent in this regard is to accept that the granting of Indian status is a \u201cservice customarily available to the general public\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act. In the Commission\u2019s view, there is no other section in the Act that could reasonably be interpreted to support the kinds of complaints that Parliament clearly envisioned when enacting the former section 67 in 1977.\n[45] The Commission also submits that Indian registration meets all the general criteria that are currently used to determine whether government conduct qualifies as a \u201cservice\u201d: (i) registration as an Indian under the Indian Act confers tangible and intangible benefits (including the ability to pass a status entitlement to one\u2019s child or grandchild); (ii) those benefits are \u201cheld out\u201d and \u201coffered\u201d to the eligible public in the terms of the Indian Act itself, and in publicly-available government publications; (iii) persons seeking to be registered under the Indian Act are required to submit applications to the Office of the Indian Registrar; (iv) past case law has recognized that the terms of federal benefits legislation, and the actions of government departments in administering that legislation, are subject to review as \u201cservices\u201d under section 5 of the Act; and, (v) treating the registration scheme under the Indian Act as a \u201cservice\u201d would also be consistent with decisions from other jurisdictions that have found government benefit schemes to be \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of the applicable human rights statutes.\n[46] The Respondent, on the other hand, does not view entitlement to registration under the Indian Act as a \u201cservice\u201d under section 5 of the Act. According to the Respondent, while the processing of applications for registration may constitute a \u201cservice\u201d under section 5 of the Act, Parliament\u2019s criteria for identifying who is eligible for registration in section 6 of the Indian Act is not a service. The Complainant is not saying that his application was processed any differently from other applications resulting in discrimination; rather, these complaints are about the parameters within which Parliament has delineated the Indian status population. In this regard, Parliamentary law making is not a service.\nAnalysis\n[47] In determining whether or not Indian registration, as alleged by the Complainants and the Commission in this case, is a service under the Act, it is useful here to provide greater clarity on what is meant in s. 5 by the words \u201ca service customarily available to the general public\u201d. In Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 S.C.J. No. 29 [Gould], the Supreme Court of Canada interpreted s. 8(a) of the Yukon Human Rights Act, which prohibits any person from discriminating \u201cwhen offering or providing services, goods, or facilities to the public\u201d, in light of other analogous provisions of the various Canadian human rights statutes, including s. 5 of the Act. The Court comes to establish a two-part analysis to interpret this section at paragraph 68:\nThe first step in the analysis involves a determination of what constitutes the \"service\", based on the facts before the court. Having determined what the \"service\" is, the next step requires a determination of whether the service creates a public relationship between the service provider and the service user. Inherent in this determination is a decision as to what constitutes \"the public\" to which the service is being offered, recalling that public is to be defined in relational as opposed to quantitative terms. In ascertaining a \"public relationship\" arising from a service, criteria including, but not limited to, selectivity in the provision of the service, diversity in the public to whom the service is offered, involvement of non-members in the service, whether the service is of a commercial nature, the intimate nature of the service and the purpose of offering the service will all be relevant. I would emphasize that none of these criteria operate determinatively; for example, the mere fact that an organization is exclusive with respect to the offering or providing of its service does not necessarily immunize that service from the reach of anti-discrimination legislation. A public relationship is to be determined by examining the relevant factors in a contextual manner.\n[48] The scope of section 5 has been further defined in recent years with cases like Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, 2008 FCA 170, 378 N.R. 268 [Watkin], Forward v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 5 [Forward] and Dreaver v. Pankiw, 2009 CHRT 8 [Pankiw] upheld by the Federal Court in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Pankiw, 2010 FC 555 [Pankiw FC]. In Watkin, the Federal Court of Appeal expressly rejects the idea that all government actions come within the ambit of section 5 of the Act. The Court disavows the finding in Bailey v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), (1980) 1 C.H.R.D.\/193 that \u201call government actions in the performance of a statutory function constitute \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of section 5 because they are undertaken by the \u201cpublic service\u201d for the public good\u201d. (See also Menghani v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission) (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/236 at D\/244\u2014D\/246 and Re Singh, [1989] 1 F.C. 430 (F.C.A.)). Rather, the Court defines section 5 as contemplating \u201csomething of benefit being \u201cheld out\u201d as services and \u201coffered\u201d to the public\u201d and which are the result of a process taking place \u201cin the context of a public relationship\u201d. The Court offers some examples of government actions that would constitute a service at para. 28:\nPublic authorities can and do engage in the provision of services in fulfilling their statutory functions. For example, the Canada Revenue Agency provides a service when it issues advance income tax rulings; Environment Canada provides a service when it publicizes weather and road conditions; Health Canada provides a service when it encourages Canadians to take an active role in their health by increasing their level of physical activity and eating well; Immigration Canada provides a service when it advises immigrants about how to become a Canadian resident. That said, not all government actions are services.\n[49] In Pankiw, the Tribunal determined that Householders (printed brochures sent to households within a constituency) sent by Dr. Jim Pankiw, Member of Parliament for the Federal riding Saskatoon Humbolt in 2002-2003 to his constituents and alleged to contain discriminatory content, were not a service and were therefore not subject to the provisions of the Act. The Tribunal relied on the interpretation of section 5 made in Watkin but went further, accounting for cases like Canada (A.G.) v. McKenna, [1999] 1 F.C. 401 (CA) [McKenna (F.C.)] and Forward, and determined that a service must require something of benefit or assistance being held out, but that one may also inquire \u201cwhether that benefit or assistance was the essential nature of the activity\u201d: Pankiw FC at para. 42.\n[50] Applied to the facts in Pankiw, the Tribunal found that the fundamental purpose and character of the Householders, which were funded by the House of Commons, was to enable Members of Parliament to further their political communications needs. It was the Members of Parliament, and not the constituents, who were the true prime beneficiaries of the Householders and as a result, their content did not constitute a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the Act. Moving on to the second part of the analysis set out in Gould, the Tribunal found that, moreover, even if the content of the Householders did constitute a service, it did not occur in the context of a public relationship as the public had not been invited to participate in the creation of the Householders. The Tribunal concluded that while the distribution of the Householders to the constituents did give rise to a public relationship and could have constituted a \u201cservice\u201d under the Act, this activity was not alleged to have occurred in any discriminatory way. It therefore concluded that there was no contravention of the Act. On judicial review, the Federal Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s decision, finding that the Tribunal had added to or clarified the law with regard to s. 5 as it stood post-Watkin.\n[51] Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, the Tribunal must therefore first determine, on the basis of the evidence presented, what constitutes the \u201cservice\u201d and whether it was provided for in a discriminatory manner.\n[52] There is no contention on this point. The Commission and the Complainant have both clearly stated that the complaints are with regard to Indian registration pursuant to the\nIndian Act: See Complainant\u2019s Arguments, lines 49-51. During the hearing the Complainant was asked whether he was alleging that discrimination had occurred in the process of the Indian registration by AANDC officials. The Indian registrar manages section 11 of the Indian Act band membership lists, offers information and processes the registration applications, all of which would indicate the existence of services being held out to the public. The Complainant has however affirmed that this does not form the basis for allegations: See Testimony of Roger Andrews, October 15, 2012. The Complainant\u2019s only contention lies in the registration provisions in the Indian Act insofar as they exclude him from registration under s. 6(1) due to his father\u2019s enfranchisement (the second complaint) thereby precluding him from passing Indian status to his children, including his daughter Michelle Andrews (the first complaint).\n[53] Can these registration provisions therefore constitute a \u201cservice\u201d in that they hold out a benefit as per Watkin? The Complainant and the Commission argue as much. They allege that Indian registration confers a number of tangible and intangible benefits such as non-insured health benefits, tax exemptions for goods purchased on reserve and eligibility for financial assistance with post-secondary education to name a few. The Commission also contends that this position is supported by decisions like Alberta (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development) v. Cunningham, 2011 SCC 37 [Cunningham] and McIvor. The Respondent, however, disagrees with this characterization, stating that Indian registration is not like other benefit schemes in that it more closely resembles the benefits obtained from Canadian citizenships as was the case in Forward. The Respondent contends that, as per Forward, since it defines the relationship between the individual and the state, Indian registration does not constitute a \u201cservice\u201d under the Act.\n[54] The conclusion in Forward that was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in Murphy, and is therefore binding on this Tribunal, dealt with the notion that direct attacks to legislation fall outside the scope of the Act as they are aimed at the legislation per se, and nothing else: Forward at para. 6. Member Sinclair\u2019s subsequent finding that \u201ccitizenship is a distinct status granted by the state\u201d and therefore \u201cto characterize it as a mere service is to ignore its fundamental role in defining the relationship between individuals and the state\u201d only serves to support this first conclusion. Indeed, in Forward, the alleged discriminatory actions of citizenship officials were found to be immune from scrutiny under the Act because they flowed directly from the provisions of the Citizenship Act, not because of the \u201cdistinct status\u201d of citizenship. Had the legislation not been directly challenged, discriminatory actions by citizenship officials would not be immune from scrutiny under the Act simply because of the \u201cdistinct status\u201d acquired through citizenship. Therefore, the fact that an alleged discriminatory action defines \u201cthe relationship between the individual and the state\u201d has no bearing on the service analysis pursuant to section 5 of the Act.\n[55] Turning to the Watkin test, in my view, Indian status obtained through registration does confer tangible and intangible benefits to the public. In addition to the benefits detailed by the Commission and recognized by the Supreme Court in Cunningham and McIvor, I note that the Complainant also highlighted the correlation between Indian registration and obtaining band membership as well as the cultural importance of passing Indian status on to his children. There is undoubtedly great significance and there are numerous benefits attached to obtaining Indian status. Having said this, beyond finding that the impugned activity constitutes \u201csomething of benefit\u201d, the test in Watkin also states that it should be \u201c\u201cheld out\u201d as services and \u201coffered to the public\u201d\u201d, relying, in this regard, on Gould at paragraph 55:\n[\u2026] There is, therefore, a requisite public relationship between the service provider and the service receiver, to the extent that the public must be granted access to or admitted to or extended the service by the service provider. There is a transitive connotation from the language employed by the various provisions; it is not until the service, accommodation, facility, etc., passes from the service provider and has been held out to the public that it attracts the anti-discrimination prohibition. [\u2026]\n[56] The \u201ctransitive connotation\u201d from the language of the various Human Rights Acts examined in Gould is present in section 5 of the Act in the words \u201cin the provision of services\u201d. In providing benefits such as non-insured health benefits, financial support and tax exemptions, and in processing Indian registration application, departments like AANDC, Health Canada and Canada Revenue Agency are all service providers, providing a service to the public pursuant to section 5 of the Act. However, as stated earlier, this is not the object of the present complaint. The present complaints challenge the provisions of the Indian Act itself. As such, the question that I must answer is: In providing for these benefits through the Indian registration provisions of the Indian Act, in other words, in the act of creating legislation, is Parliament a service provider, holding out a service to the public? The answer is no.\n[57] Law-making is one of Parliament\u2019s most fundamental and significant functions and\nsui generis in its nature. This is confirmed by the powers, privileges and immunities that Parliament and the Legislatures possess to ensure their proper functioning, which are rooted in the Constitution, by virtue of the preamble and section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Victoria, c 3, [Constitution Act] and in statute law, in sections 4 and 5 of the Parliament of Canada Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-1: Telezone Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), (2004), 235 D.L.R. (4th) 719 at paras. 13-17. Indeed, the dignity, integrity and efficient functioning of the Legislature is preserved through parliamentary privilege which, once established, is afforded constitutional status and is immune from review: Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), (1996), 137 D.L.R. (4th) 142, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 876; Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30 at para. 33 [Vaid]. To consider the act of legislating along the same lines as that of delivering Householders as in Pankiw or to processing a citizenship application as in Forward is fundamentally problematic and emblematic of an approach which ignores the special role law-making possesses in our society. In legislating, Parliament is not a service provider and there is no \u201ctransitive connotation\u201d to this function. Rather, it is fulfilling a constitutionally mandated role, at the very core of our democracy. As such, while law-making is an activity that could be said to take place \u201cin the context of a public relationship\u201d (Gould at para. 16) or \u201ccreates a public relationship\u201d (Gould at para. 68, cited above) as per the second part of the Gould test, to characterize it as a service would ignore this sui generis quality.\n[58] This reasoning is supported when applying rules of statutory interpretation to the term \u201cservices\u201d in section 5 of the Act. According to the modern principle of statutory interpretation, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme and object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament: Elmer A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes, (Toronto: Butterworths, 1974) at p. 67. In Forward, the Tribunal examined the meaning of \u201cservices\u201d in light of the associated words rule of noscitur a sociis:\nParliament might reasonably have intended the ambit of the word \u201cservices\u201d in section 5 to be informed by its placement alongside the words \u201cgoods\u201d, \u201cfacilities\u201d and accommodation\u201d. (noscitur a sociis, \u201cthe associated words rule\u201d). Viewed in this way, it is very difficult to conclude that the grant of citizenship is a service having a similar character to goods, facilities or accommodation.\n[59] I believe that this interpretation is also in harmony with the purpose of the Act as stated at section 2:\nThe purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted or in respect of which a record suspension has been ordered.\n[60] Even if law-making does not constitute a \u201cservice\u201d and therefore cannot be considered to be a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d, this in no way takes away from the aim of the Act to enable individuals to live without the hindrance of what do constitute \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d. While the Commission argues that nothing in this section suggests that conduct prescribed by law is somehow immune from review of compliance with the purposes of the Act, in my view nothing in this section supports the idea either. Even with the broad and purposeful interpretation attributed to human rights legislation, the words of a statute must not be given a meaning which their construction cannot reasonably bear: R. v. Z. (D.A.), [1992] S.C.J. No. 80 at 1042. As for Parliamentary intent, I examine the question in greater detail below in response to the Commission\u2019s submissions regarding the recently repealed section 67 of the Act. Suffice it to say here that I do not understand Parliament\u2019s intent to allow for the direct challenge of legislation by the Act.\n[61] Having said this, it is true that legislation has, in the past, been accepted to constitute a \u201cservice customarily available to the general public\u201d pursuant to s. 5 of the Act. In Canada (Attorney General) v. Druken, [1989] 2 F.C. 24 (C.A.) [Druken], the complainants, who were employees of businesses owned by their spouses, were denied unemployment insurance benefits on the basis of their marital and\/or family status. The Tribunal found that the refusal of a benefit, pursuant to the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1971, constituted a denial of a service on a prohibited ground of discrimination pursuant to s. 5 of the Act and was therefore discriminatory. Subsequent cases like Gonzalez v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), [1997] F.C.J. No. 790 [Gonzalez] at para. 37, McAllister-Windsor v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2001] C.H.R.D. No. 4 [McAllister-Windsor] at para. 30 and McKenna v. Canada (Department of Secretary of State), [1993] C.H.R.D. No. 18 [McKenna], affirmed the principle that benefits provided pursuant to legislation such as the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Citizenship Act constituted a service under s. 5 of the Act. The Tribunal\u2019s decision in McKenna was appealed however, and while neither the Federal Court nor the Federal Court of Appeal dealt this particular finding, Robertson J.A. made the following obiter, bringing this principle into question (Canada (A.G.) v. McKenna, [1999] 1 F.C. 401 (CA) [McKenna (F.C.)] at paras. 78 \u2011 80):\nWhile focusing on this particular issue, I do not wish to leave the impression that I agree with the Tribunal's conclusion that the granting of citizenship constitutes a service customarily available to the general public within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act and, therefore, that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to negotiate with the responsible Minister the manner in which the provisions of the Citizenship Act are to be applied in future. As this particular issue was not pursued before either the Motions Judge or this Court, I do not propose to deal with it other than to lay to rest the mistaken view that this Court's decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Druken, [1989] 2 F.C. 24 (C.A.) somehow supports the proposition that the denial of citizenship constitutes the denial of a service.\n[\u2026]\nIn my opinion, Druken does not stand for the proposition that denial of unemployment insurance benefits constitutes denial of service within the meaning of the Canadian Human Rights Act, but only that the Attorney General conceded as much.\n[62] The Tribunal came to a similar conclusion in 2009 in Forward. It found that the sole source of the alleged discrimination, the denial of citizenship due to parental lineage pursuant to the 1977 Citizenship Act, R.S.C. c. C-29 [the 1977 Act], was the legislative language of the 1977 Act. In reviewing the application for citizenship, the officials had done nothing more than apply categorical statutory criteria to undisputed facts. Any issue taken with the application review process was therefore really an issue taken with the 1977 Act (Forward at para. 38). Relying on Robertson J.A.\u2019s interpretation of Druken in McKenna (F.C.), the Tribunal found that the granting of citizenship did not constitute a service under s. 5 of the Act.\n[63] The Federal Court of Appeal upheld this finding in 2012 in Murphy. The Court found that as the complaint was a direct attack on sections 110.2 and 120.31 of the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th Supp.) and therefore aimed solely at the legislation per se, it fell outside the scope of the Act. Relying on Justice O\u2019Reilly\u2019s obiter in Wignall v. Canada (Department of National Revenue (Taxation)), 2003 FC 1280, the Court noted that such attacks could only succeed with a constitutional challenge as the Act does not provide for the filing of a complaint directed against an act of Parliament. The Court noted that despite the concession made by the Attorney General in Druken that the denial of unemployment insurance constituted a denial of a service under the Act, the facts were clear that the complaint was directed solely at paragraphs 3(2)(c) and 4(3)(d) of the Unemployment Insurance Act, S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 80 and 4(3)(d) of the Unemployment Insurance Regulations, C.R.C., c. 1576). The Court suggests that had the parties argued this point, Druken would, for the same reasons cited in the present case, have been decided differently.\n[64] In dismissing the complaint, Murphy not only concludes that legislation is not a service pursuant to s. 5 of the Act, but removes any direct attack to legislation from the purview of the Act as a whole. I have already concluded, for above-stated reasons, that law-making is not a service under the Act. However, if this Tribunal accepts that it must follow Murphy as argued by the Respondent, then this decision disposes of the present complaints in their entirety.\nB. If the complaints are solely a challenge to legislation, does the Act allow for such complaints? [65] The Commission acknowledges that on its face, the Murphy decision would be a full answer to the present complaints, which are aimed at government conduct that was mandatory under the registration provisions of the Indian Act. However, in the Commission\u2019s view, Murphy is contrary to binding case law from the Supreme Court of Canada, finding that human rights laws have primacy over other inconsistent laws and render inconsistent legislation inoperable. Up until Murphy, a long line of case law within the federal human rights system had also recognized these principles. Therefore, the Tribunal should respectfully decline to apply Murphy and should instead follow the binding direction from the Supreme Court. The Commission also argues that cases from across the country have recognized the primacy of human rights laws and the ability to challenge government conduct that is mandatory under the wording of legislation.\n[66] The Commission also notes that Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to the wording of other federal legislation is reflected in several current provisions of the Act: 2, 49(5), and 62(1). In a similar vein, the Commission also points to the former section 67 of the Act, which it claims was specifically enacted to shield the registration provisions of the Indian Act from review under the Act.\n[67] The Complainant adopted the Commission\u2019s arguments on this issue.\n[68] According to the Respondent, the Commission\u2019s arguments invite the Tribunal to fall into error as they run contrary to the doctrine of stare decisis and the principle that the Tribunal is bound by decisions of the Federal Court and Federal Court of Appeal. The Respondent submits that the Supreme Court cases relied upon by the Commission did not interpret the specific provisions of the Act in question in this complaint, namely subsection 40(1) and sections 5 to 14.1. Instead, the Respondent views the Supreme Court cases as making general comments about the nature of human rights legislation. In Murphy, however, the Respondent submits the Federal Court of Appeal interpreted subsection 40(1) and sections 5 to 14.1 of the Act, while taking into account the entire context of the Act. Since the Tribunal is now tasked with interpreting those same provisions, the Respondent claims it must follow the decision in Murphy.\n[69] Each of the Commission\u2019s arguments will be addressed in turn.\n(i) Supreme Court of Canada and other federal human rights case law regarding the primacy of human rights legislation Commission\u2019s position\n[70] Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decisions in Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145 [Heerspink], and Winnipeg School Division No. 1 v. Craton, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 150 [Craton], the Commission submits that where there is a conflict between human rights law and other legislation, the human rights law will govern as a quasi-constitutional statement of public policy, and will supersede inconsistent legislation, unless the legislature has clearly stated otherwise in express and unequivocal language. This presumed primacy of human rights laws means, according to the Commission, that inconsistent legislation is rendered inoperable, as was explained by the Supreme Court of Canada in cases like Tranchemontagne v. Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program), 2006 SCC 14 [Tranchemontagne], and Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al, 2004 SCC 30 [Larocque].\n[71] The Commission claims that prior to the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy, a long line of case law within the federal human rights system had recognized the Act as having primacy over other inconsistent laws, consistent with the principles set out in cases like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne. In this regard, the Commission relies on the following cases: Druken; Gonzalez; McAllister-Windsor; Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569 [Uzoaba]; the dissenting reasons of Dickson C.J. and Lamer J. in Bhinder v. CN, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 561 [Bhinder]; and, the dissenting reasons of McLachlin J. and L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 J. in Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 SCR 854 [Cooper].\n[72] In the circumstances of this case, the Commission claims the Tribunal is faced with two contradictory lines of authority from higher decision-makers: (i) the Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence, declaring that in the absence of a clear legislative statement to the contrary, human rights laws render other laws inoperable; and, (ii) the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Murphy, finding the opposite. Under the principles of vertical stare decisis, the Commission argues the Tribunal must follow the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada.\nAnalysis\n[73] The Tribunal has recently examined the Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence dealing with the primacy of human rights legislation in light of the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy. In a decision dated May 24, 2013, Member Ed Lustig dismissed the complaints of Jeremy and Mardy Matson and Melody Schneider: Matson et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2013 CHRT 13, [Matson]. The Matsons and Ms. Schneider, who are siblings, argued that due to their matrilineal Indian heritage, pursuant to which they were found eligible for registration under subsection 6(2) of the Indian Act, they were treated differently than others whose lineage was paternal and therefore registered under subsection 6(1) of the Indian Act. They maintained that the registration provisions in the Indian Act, as they are applied to them, were discriminatory on the basis of sex, family status, race, national origin and\/or ethnic origin contrary to s. 5 of the Act.\n[74] Much like Mr. Andrews in the present case, the Matsons and Ms. Schneider argued that registration as an Indian under the Indian Act was a \u201cservice\u201d under s. 5 of the Act and therefore within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. While the Commission and the Complainants in Matson did not concede that the complaints amounted to a direct challenge to legislation and nothing else, the Tribunal concluded that this was indeed the case: Matson at para. 60. While Matson does not deal with the issue of enfranchisement and its consequences, the legal issues raised are the same as the ones before me in the present instance.\n[75] The Commission also participated in Matson. Its submissions on the issue of the primacy of human rights legislation as stated in Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence and the alleged inconsistency with the Murphy decision were virtually identical to the ones made before me in the present case: See Matson at paras. 30-33. The Tribunal in Matson addressed these submissions. Over the span of thirteen pages of analysis, the Tribunal considered, one by one, each of the Supreme Court of Canada cases regarding the interpretation and primacy of human rights laws relied upon by the Complainants and the Commission, namely, Heerspink, Craton, CN v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 SCR 114 [Action Travail des Femmes], Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 SCR 143 [Andrews], Larocque and Tranchemontagne: Matson at paras. 66-91.\n[76] The Tribunal concludes this analysis as follows:\n[92] Pursuant to the analysis above, in my view, Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontage support the Complainants and Commission\u2019s claim that human rights legislation can render inoperable, legislation that is in conflict with it. However, that is not to say that the Act allows for complaints that challenge the wording of other laws, absent a discriminatory practice within the meaning of the Act.\n[93] There are no comments from the Supreme Court in any of these cases that indicate that the primacy of human rights legislation equates to the ability to challenge legislation under human rights legislation. The basis of the conflict between legislation in Heerspink, Craton and Larocque was couched in the terms of a \u201cdiscrimination\u201d complaint under the applicable human rights legislation in those cases. The complaints themselves were not challenges to the wording of other laws.\n[94] In this regard, Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne are actually consistent with the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Murphy, in the sense that the Federal Court of Appeal required there to be a \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of section 5 of the Act, for there to be a valid complaint in that case.\n[77] I do not propose to conduct this analysis again here. I have reviewed these decisions along with the Tribunal\u2019s reasons in detail and share the view that the above-stated Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence and the Murphy decision are not in contradiction. I agree that human rights legislation, including the Act, has the ability to render inoperable other conflicting legislation pursuant to Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne and supported by Action Travail des Femmes. However, this does not preclude the necessity for the existence of a discriminatory practice pursuant to the Act, thereby giving the Tribunal the jurisdiction to examine the complaint as expressed in Murphy.\n[78] Contrary to the Commission\u2019s submissions, this view is also supported by the long line of federal cases which preceded Murphy. As detailed in my preceding analysis on the meaning of a \u201cservice\u201d pursuant to section 5 of the Act, the cases in Druken, Gonzalez and McAllister-Windsor stood for the principle that benefits provided pursuant to the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Citizenship Act constituted a service under s. 5 of the Act. Along with Gould, Watkin, Pankiw, McKenna and Forward, they form part of the evolving jurisprudence that has helped to define the scope of section 5 of the Act. While the term \u201cservice\u201d may have been conceived differently under Druken, Gonzalez and McAllister-Windsor then it was subsequently in Murphy, I do not read these cases as foregoing the jurisdictional requirement for the Tribunal to find the existence of a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d within the meaning of the Act.\n[79] The Commission also relies on Uzoaba and the dissenting reasons in Bhinder and Cooper as evidence of the ability of the Act to render inoperative legislation, such as the Public Service Employment Act and the Canada Labour Code, where certain provisions come into conflict with the Act. This argument was also addressed by the Tribunal in Matson and like Member Lustig, I am of the view that while these cases affirm the primacy of the Act when it comes into conflict with other legislation, consistent with the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne none address the issue of whether legislation can be challenged under the Act as a \u201cservice\u201d: Matson at paras 114 and 116-118.\n[80] In light of the above, I must disagree with the Commission\u2019s characterization of the issue as one of two contradictory lines of authority from higher decision-makers. For the above-stated reasons, I do not believe that Murphy is in contradiction with either the Supreme Court of Canada or the previous federal court jurisprudence dealing with the primacy of human rights laws.\n[81] Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne must also be harmonized with other Supreme Court jurisprudence such as Alberta v. Hutterian Bretheren of Wilson Colony, 2009 SCC 37 [Hutterian Bretheren]. In this decision, the Honourable Justice McLachlin C.J. elaborates on the distinction between the reasonable accommodation analysis undertaken when applying human rights laws, and the s. 1 justification analysis that applies to a claim that a law infringes the Charter. In so doing, she explains why, where the validity of a law is at stake, the appropriate approach is a s. 1 Oakes analysis and the minimal impairment test (See R. v. Oakes, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103):\n[68] Minimal impairment and reasonable accommodation are conceptually distinct. Reasonable accommodation is a concept drawn from human rights statutes and jurisprudence. It envisions a dynamic process whereby the parties\u2014 most commonly an employer and employee \u2014 adjust the terms of their relationship in conformity with the requirements of human rights legislation, up to the point at which accommodation would mean undue hardship for the accommodating party. In Multani, Deschamps and Abella JJ. explained:\nThe process required by the duty of reasonable accommodation takes into account the specific details of the circumstances of the parties and allows for dialogue between them. This dialogue enables them to reconcile their positions and find common ground tailored to their own needs. [para. 131]\n[69]A very different kind of relationship exists between a legislature and the people subject to its laws. By their very nature, laws of general application are not tailored to the unique needs of individual claimants. The legislature has no capacity or legal obligation to engage in such an individualized determination, and in many cases would have no advance notice of a law\u2019s potential to infringe Charter rights. It cannot be expected to tailor a law to every possible future contingency, or every sincerely held religious belief. Laws of general application affect the general public, not just the claimants before the court. The broader societal context in which the law operates must inform the s. 1 justification analysis. A law\u2019s constitutionality under s. 1 of the Charter is determined, not by whether it is responsive to the unique needs of every individual claimant, but rather by whether its infringement of Charter rights is directed at an important objective and is proportionate in its overall impact. While the law\u2019s impact on the individual claimants is undoubtedly a significant factor for the court to consider in determining whether the infringement is justified, the court\u2019s ultimate perspective is societal. The question the court must answer is whether the Charter infringement is justifiable in a free and democratic society, not whether a more advantageous arrangement for a particular claimant could be envisioned.\n[70]Similarly, \u201cundue hardship\u201d, a pivotal concept in reasonable accommodation, is not easily applicable to a legislature enacting laws. In the human rights context, hardship is seen as undue if it would threaten the viability of the enterprise which is being asked to accommodate the right. The degree of hardship is often capable of expression in monetary terms. By contrast, it is difficult to apply the concept of undue hardship to the cost of achieving or not achieving a legislative objective, especially when the objective is (as here) preventative or precautionary. Though it is possible to interpret \u201cundue hardship\u201d broadly as encompassing the hardship that comes with failing to achieve a pressing government objective, this attenuates the concept. Rather than strain to adapt \u201cundue hardship\u201d to the context of s. 1 of the Charter, it is better to speak in terms of minimal impairment and proportionality of effects.\n[82] Applied to the facts of the present case, if I am to follow the Complainant\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s argument, the Respondent must justify any discrimination emanating from Parliament\u2019s delineation of Indian status in the Indian Act based on the bona fide justification test on the grounds of health, safety and cost as per sections 15(1)g) and 15(2) of the Act. Since neither health nor safety form part of the factors considered by Parliament in enacting section 7 and subsections 6(1) and 6(2) of the Indian Act, cost remains the sole manner in which the Respondent can demonstrate that extending registration to the grandchildren of those reinstated under s. 6(1)d), as requests the Complainants and the Commission, would amount to \u201cundue hardship\u201d.\n[83] For the Respondent to do so adequately, it argues that \u201ccosts\u201d must be interpreted to include \u201csocial costs\u201d. Only then would the Tribunal be able to consider the Respondent\u2019s justification for the alleged discriminatory legislation, including: the standard of gender neutrality underlying the 1985 changes to the Indian Act in Bill C-31; Parliament\u2019s role in delineating the contours of a population enjoying a historically-based relationship with the Crown; and the impact on the social, political, economic and cultural structure of bands resulting from an increase to the \u201cregistration\u201d population.\n[84] In my view, regardless of whether or not \u201ccosts\u201d can, in certain circumstances, include \u201csocial costs\u201d so as to amount to \u201cundue hardship\u201d under the Act, to stretch the \u201cundue hardship\u201d test so as to include the above underlying considerations made by Parliament in legislating would, in the words of McLachlin, \u201cattenuate the concept\u201d: Hutterian Bretheren at para. 70. Instead, these considerations best inform the question of whether the alleged infringement is justifiable in a free and democratic society as per the test under s. 1 of the Charter. As stated by the Court in Hutterian Bretheren in its conclusion on this issue:\n[\u2026] The government is entitled to justify the law, not by showing that it has accommodated the claimant, but by establishing that the measure is rationally connected to a pressing and substantial goal, minimally impairing of the right and proportionate in its effects. [para.71]\nIt is clear that the test for undue hardship provides an inadequate means for Parliament to defend a challenge to its legislation.\n[85] This only further confirms the conclusion which I have already made, namely that while the Supreme Court has affirmed the primacy of human rights legislation, this principle applies to a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d under the Act which is not present in the case at hand. Direct challenges to legislation, as currently sought by the Complainants and the Commission must, as reasoned in Murphy and demonstrated by Hutterian Bretheren, be obtained with a constitutional challenge.\n[86] It is worthwhile to take a moment here to exemplify instances where the inconsistency or conflict between the Act and other legislation have led to the application of the principle of the primacy of human rights legislation and yet where there existed no direct challenge of legislation, requiring the application of the Charter. For if my reasoning renders this principle, recognized in Supreme Court jurisprudence like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque and Tranchemontagne, devoid of any true meaning, the Court will have spoken for nothing and my reasoning is surely flawed.\n[87] One of these examples can be found in the Tribunal decision Franke v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [1998] C.H.R.D. No. 3 [Franke]. In this case, the Respondent argued that, pursuant to section 9 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. C-50 [CLPA] and section 111 of the Pension Act, R.S.C. 1985 c. P-6 [PA], the Tribunal was precluded from awarding damages for economic loss to the Complainant because she was receiving a pension from Veterans Affairs in respect of this loss. The Tribunal found that there was a conflict between those provisions and the remedies provisions of the Act. Relying on Heerspink, Craton, Action Travail des Femmes, Druken and Uzoaba, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent\u2019s argument and affirmed the primacy of the Act noting that, as the legislature had not spoken to the contrary, the Act superseded the provisions of the CLPA and the PA and therefore damages for economic loss could be awarded: Franke at paras. 644 \u2013 678.\n[88] In Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd., [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 14 [Eyerley], the Respondent filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint due to the fact that the British Columbia Worker\u2019s Compensation Board had already dealt with Mr. Eyerley\u2019s case and the BC Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, R S.B.C. 1996, Ch. 492 contained a privative clause. The Tribunal dismissed the motion, finding that due to the special nature of human rights legislation, it did not believe that the privative clauses in the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act had the effect of precluding the exercise of jurisdiction by the Tribunal pursuant to the Act: Eyerley at paras. 27-37.\n[89] In Morten v. Air Canada, 2009 CHRT 3 [Morten], rev\u2019d on other grounds Canada (Canadian Transportation Agency v. Morten), 2010 FC 1008, rev\u2019d Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Canadian Transportation Agency), 2011 FCA 332, Air Canada argued that the Tribunal should confine itself to ordering a monetary remedy as section 172 of the Canada Transportation Act, S.C. 1996, c. 10 [CTA] confers on the Canadian Transport Agency the power to determine whether there is an undue obstacle to the mobility of persons with disabilities and if necessary, order corrective action. Relying on Heerspink, Craton and Vaid, the Tribunal dismissed the argument and, having concluded in favour of the Complainant, went on to impose a number of extensive systemic remedies in addition to a monetary award for pain and suffering: Morten at paras. 189 - 218.\n[90] In Douglas v. SLH Transport Inc., 2010 CHRT 1 [Douglas], the Respondent fired the Complainant while he was in the sixth month of a bonafide medical leave waiting to have surgery on his right knee. As the Tribunal found the existence of a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability, the Respondent argued, as part of its justification for the discrimination, that subsection 239(1) of the Canada Labour Code, R.S.C., 1985, c. L-2 [the Code] allowed him to terminate the Complainant once twelve weeks had elapsed from the beginning of his medical leave. The Tribunal found that while the Code prohibited an employer from firing an employee on medical leave for a non-work related injury prior to twelve weeks if he had three years of continuous service, this did not allow employers to discriminate against employees contrary to section 7 of the Act. The Tribunal found that in light of the Act\u2019s quasi-constitutional nature as recognized in Heerspink, Craton, Uzoaba and Vaid, the Act superseded the Code in this instance. The Tribunal concluded that the Respondent had not provided a reasonable explanation or justification for its discrimination in terminating the Complainant\u2019s employment and found the complaint substantiated: Douglas at paras. 69-71.\n[91] Uzoaba is another example of a case where the Tribunal applied the principle of primacy of human rights legislation without directly challenging legislation. As part of its remedy, the Tribunal ordered the reinstatement of the Complainant at a level two steps higher than that held by him at the time of the discrimination. On judicial review, the Respondent argued that this remedy was precluded by the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-33 which establishes a scheme whereby promotions are based on merit and that this could not be overruled by the Tribunal. The Federal Court disagreed, applying the principle of primacy of the Act in the following manner:\nI think this principle of paramountcy must apply in this case to enable a Human Rights Tribunal to order a promotion which it has found has been denied for reasons of discrimination, contrary to the Act. In other words, the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission and the process respecting promotions within the Public Service must give way in those rare exceptions where promotions have been denied based on discriminatory reasons and where a Tribunal, acting within its jurisdiction under the Act, orders a promotion in order to remedy the results of discriminatory action taken by the employer. [para.20]\n[92] In all of these cases the Tribunal found the existence of a discriminatory practice, thereby grounding the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Faced with a conflict between the Act and another piece of legislation, the Tribunal relied on cases such as Heerspink and Craton and affirmed the principle of the primacy of human rights legislation. In none of these examples was the Tribunal attempting to use the Act to invalidate the conflicting provision in the same way one would use the Charter, rather the Tribunal simply concluded that the provision should simply not apply to the present case, favouring instead the application of the provision of the Act. In my view, it is in this distinction that lays the true essence of the meaning of the primacy of human rights laws.\n(ii) Other human rights case law from across the country regarding the primacy of human rights legislation [93] The Commission submits that, wherever possible, human rights statutes from across Canada should be given consistent interpretation, given their general similarities, quasi-constitutional status, and shared objectives of preventing discrimination. As a result, in considering whether the Act allows for complaints that challenge the wording of federal laws, the Commission claims it is also useful to examine case law from other jurisdictions across Canada. The Commission submits that in these cases, decisions-makers followed cases like Heerspink, Craton, Larocque, Tranchemontagne and the Druken line of federal case law and accepted that (i) steps taken by government actors under mandatory terms of legislation can qualify as \u201cservices\u201d for the purposes of human rights review, and\/or (ii) quasi-constitutional human rights statutes can be used to render conflicting legislation inoperable, and thereby remedy its discriminatory impact. The Commission refers the Tribunal to the following cases: Ontario (Disability Support Program) v. Tranchemontagne, 2010 ONCA 593 [Tranchemontagne (ONCA)]; Hendershott v. Ontario (Community and Social Services), 2011 HRTO 482 [Hendershott]; Ivancicevic v. Ontario (Consumer Services), 2011 HRTO 1714 [Ivancicevic]; XY v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services), 2012 HRTO 726 [XY]; Gwinner v. Alberta (Human Resources and Employment), 2002 ABQB 685 [Gwinner]; Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services), 1988 CanLII 212 (SK CA) [Chambers]; Saskatchewan (Workers' Compensation Board) v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission), 1999 CanLII 12368 (SK CA) [Wiebe]; Human Rights Commission v. Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission, 2005 NLCA 61 [Nfld HRC]; Neubauer v. British Columbia (Ministry of Human Resources), 2005 BCHRT 239 [Neubauer]; and, A.A. v. New Brunswick (Department of Family and Community Services), [2004] N.B.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4 (QL) [AA].\n[94] These are once again the same arguments that were made before the Tribunal in Matson and which the Tribunal disposed of at paragraphs 121 to 126 of this decision. I do not believe that these cases refute the conclusion that a \u201cservice\u201d must exist regardless of the quasi-constitutional nature of human rights legislation. Indeed, with the exception perhaps of the Gwinner decision which does not address the issue of the existence of a service in the circumstances of that case (and which, for this very reason, is of little help to the Tribunal in the case at hand), all of these cases make a finding of the existence of a service. While some may have found, implicitly (Hendershott at paras. 69-70, 79; Neubauer at para. 61; Tranchemontagne at para. 50) or explicitly (AA at para. 49; Ivancicevic at para. 151; XY at paras 85 - 87), that legislation is a service and can therefore be directly challenged under human rights law, for reasons stated above, I have come to a different conclusion which I have found to be supported by the Federal and Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence. I note that while these cases could have had a persuasive effect, they are in no way authoritative or binding on the Tribunal.\n(iii) Current provisions of the Act [95] According to the Commission, the principle that complaints may be filed concerning other federal laws is reflected in subsection 49(5) and 62(1) of the Act. Subsection 49(5) of the Act reads as follows:\nIf the complaint involves a question about whether another Act or a regulation made under another Act is inconsistent with this Act or a regulation made under it, the member assigned to inquire into the complaint or, if three members have been assigned, the member chairing the inquiry, must be a member of the bar of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[96] By requiring that complaints with respect to the inconsistency of other federal laws be adjudicated by a Tribunal member who is a member of the bar of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Quebec, the Commission views subsection 49(5) as demonstrating Parliament\u2019s understanding that such complaints may be filed and determined on their merits. The Commission also submits that the proceedings leading to the passage of subsection 49(5) contain numerous comments demonstrating the government\u2019s recognition and acceptance that the Act applies to the wording of other federal laws. If the Respondent is correct in arguing that the Act does not apply to the wording of other laws, then the Commission argues subsection 49(5) is rendered meaningless, which cannot be what Parliament intended.\n[97] This argument was also made before the Tribunal in Matson. I note, like the Tribunal in that case, that subsection 49(5) of the Act refers to the inconsistency between the Act and other pieces of legislation and does not imply the Act\u2019s ability to directly challenge legislation. This section may very well recognize the primacy of the Act when it is in conflict with other laws, however I have already provided numerous examples of instances (see paras. 86-91) where primacy applies and yet where there is no direct challenge to legislation. This subsection in no way alters this reasoning.\n[98] I also agree with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation in Matson as to the purpose of subsection 49(5) of the Act. The Tribunal found that the passages from the Parliament proceedings leading to the adoption of the section on which the Commission relies indicate that the underlying intent was to have lawyers adjudicate cases involving questions of inconsistency of legislation. Since cases of this nature could be legalistic and complex, this requirement was meant to facilitate an efficient and expeditious resolution. This is further confirmed when subsection 49(5) is considered alongside the other subsections of section 49 which deal with the procedural steps which take place upon the referral of a complaint by the Commission to the Tribunal. This includes, at subsection 49(2), the Chairperson\u2019s ability to assign a three-member panel in complex cases, which again, aims to ensure process efficiency and expeditiousness: Matson at para. 131.\n[99] Turning to subsection 62(1) of the Act, this section states the following:\nThis Part and Parts I and II do not apply to or in respect of any superannuation or pension fund or plan established by an Act of Parliament enacted before March 1, 1978.\nThe Commission submits that this provision provides what the Supreme Court decisions have always allowed for: a statutory exception to the general rule that human rights laws are paramount. According to the Commission, without this exemption, the Act would have applied to and affected any discriminatory provisions in the federal pension or superannuation legislation. The Commission claims this is confirmed by a review of the legislative history of subsection 62(1). Again, if the Respondent is correct in arguing that the Act does not apply to the wording of other laws, then the Commission argues subsection 62(1) is rendered meaningless, which cannot be what Parliament intended.\n[100] As found in Matson, the argument, as the Commission intends it, once again confuses the principle of primacy of human rights legislation with direct challenges to legislation. Subsection 62(1) is evidence of the primacy of the Act, something which, for reasons above, is well recognized here. The subsection does not in any way remove the jurisdictional requirement of the existence of a discriminatory practice as set out in section 5 to 14.1 of the Act. Indeed, according to subsection 40(1) of the Act, individuals may file a complaint with the Commission provided that they have reasonable grounds for believing that a person has engaged in a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d and section 39 defines a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d as any practice within the meaning of section 5 to 14.1 of the Act: Matson at paras. 128, 132-135.\n(iv) The former section 67 of the Act [101] Similar to its argument regarding subsection 62(1), the Commission points to the wording of the former section 67 of the Act as demonstrating Parliament\u2019s intent that the Act apply to discriminatory provisions of federal laws. The former section 67 of the Act, which was repealed in 2008 (Bill C-21, An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, 2nd Sess., 39th Parl., 2008), provided:\nNothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\nLike subsection 62(1), the Commission argues the former section 67 functioned as a statutory exception to the general principle that human rights laws have primacy. Without the exemption, the Commission claims the Act would have applied to and affected any discriminatory provisions in the Indian Act. Again, if the Respondent is correct in arguing that the Act does not apply to the wording of other laws, then the Commission submits section 67 was meaningless and had no effect during its lifespan, which cannot be what Parliament intended. According to the Commission, the historical context of section 67 demonstrates it was specifically enacted to shield the registration provisions of the Indian Act from review under the Act. In the same vein, in repealing section 67 in 2008, the Commission is of the view Parliament intended to open the door to human rights complaints challenging discriminatory aspects of those same provisions.\n[102] The Commission relies on various government statements, some by the Minister of Justice, and governmental memorandums and briefing notes which demonstrate that when section 63(2) of the Act (which subsequently became section 67) was enacted in the late 1970s, government officials understood that Parliament\u2019s intent for the enactment was to prevent the Tribunal from finding provisions of the Indian Act to be discriminatory. I accept that this evidence is persuasive and that Parliament may have feared scrutiny of the Indian Act by the Act and decided to ensure its protection by enacting section 67. In so doing, Parliament would have indeed implicitly imputed to the Act the ability to challenge legislation. I also accept that, in light of Tribunal case law like Druken and McAllister-Windsor and the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Gonzalez, in the absence of section 67, there was indeed a risk that the Indian Act would have been considered by the Tribunal.\n[103] Having said this, for reasons stated above, these cases were decided on the basis of an interpretation of section 5 of the Act which no longer reflects current day understanding. Moreover, while this may reflect Parliament\u2019s intent to prevent challenges to the Indian Act by the Act in a pre-Charter era, this evidence is in and of itself insufficient to demonstrate that when Parliament enacted the Act in its entirety, it intended for this legislation to possess the ability to directly challenge other legislation. For, as I do not understand Complainant and the Commission to argue that this ability is limited to the challenge of the Indian Act, then it must also be true for all pieces of legislation. To come to this conclusion, we must examine the Act as a whole and for reasons already stated, I have concluded that the rules of statutory interpretation do not support the interpretation argued by the Complainant.\n[104] In addition, contrary to the Commission\u2019s submission, I do not believe that this conclusion renders the existence of section 67 meaningless. Even if Parliament intended to protect the provisions of the Indian Act from scrutiny by the Act, section 67 also stated that nothing in the Act affected \u201cany provision made under or pursuant to that Act\u201d. This is precisely the focus of the statutory interpretation conducted by the Honourable Justice Desjardins J.A. (as she then was) in Desjarlais (Re) (C.A.), [1989] 3 F.C. 605 [Desjarlais] at para. 13:\nThe word \"provision\" in the expression \"or any provision made under or pursuant to [the Indian Act]\" cannot have the same meaning as the first word \"provision\" and cannot refer exclusively to a legislative enactment of general application as counsel for the Commission submits. Such interpretation is made impossible by the French version. The word \"dispositions\" in that version might have the meaning of \"mesures l\u00e9gislatives\" but it encompasses as well the very wide connotation of \"d\u00e9cisions\", \"mesures\". So that the words \"or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act\" mean more than a mere stipulation of a legal character. I interpret such words as covering any decision made under or pursuant to the Indian Act.\n[Emphasis added]\n[105] The Court in Desjarlais found that the decision in the case of bar, that of a Band Council\u2019s vote of non-confidence, or firing of one of the band\u2019s administrators on the ground that she was too old, was nowhere provided for by the Indian Act and therefore did not fall within the exempting provisions of subsection 63(2) (now known as section 67) of the Act. Despite this conclusion, the case has since been cited as authority for its interpretation of section 67. In\nLaslo v. Gordon Band (Council), [1996] C.H.R.D. No. 12 [Laslo], the Tribunal relied on this interpretation, finding that section 67 of the Act applied to decisions that, by virtue of their subject matter, are within the authority expressly granted by a provision of the Indian Act: Laslo at paras. 43 and 44. The Tribunal found that pursuant to section 67, the Gordan Band Reserve band council\u2019s denial to allocate housing to Ms. Laslo, a reinstated First Nations woman, pursuant to its authority under section 20 of the Indian Act, was immune from scrutiny under the Act. This finding was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal: Laslo v. Gordon Band (Council), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1175.\n[106] Far from being meaningless, it is with the repeal of section 67 that cases of this kind may now be brought before the Canadian Human Rights Commission and the Tribunal. The Indian Act provides for the provision of a number of services and allows Bands the discretion to implement various rules and policies, all of which arguably now fall within the ambit of the Act. In my view, the words of the Honourable Jim Prentice, then Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development during a 2007 appearance before the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development with regard to the proposed repeal of s. 67 of the Act, on which the Commission itself relies, illustrate well the implications of the repeal:\nThe repeal of section 67 will provide First Nation citizens, in particular first nation women, with the ability to do something that they cannot do right now, and that is to file a grievance in respect of an action either by their first nation government, or frankly by the Government of Canada, relative to decisions that affect them. This could include access to programs, access to services, the quality of the services that they\u2019ve accessed, in addition to other issues, such as membership, I assume, as well.\n[107] While my reasoning precludes challenges of decisions and\/or actions which emanate directly from the Indian Act, decisions and\/or actions which constitute a \u201cdiscriminatory practice\u201d pursuant to sections 5 to 25 of the Act and which would have previously been made \u201cunder the authority\u201d of the Indian Act now fall within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The fact that the Tribunal has already started to see cases of this kind is further evidence of this (See for example Louie and Beattie v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2011 CHRT 2).\n[108] The Commission submits that the evidence of Allan Tallman, the Indian Registrar, and Tribunal case law such as Jacobs v. Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, [1998] C.H.R.D. No. 2 [Jacobs] demonstrates that band membership has been considered to be a \u201cservice\u201d, capable of review pursuant to s. 5 of the Act. The Commission contends that if band membership, which also relates to the relationship between an individual and the state, is recognized as a \u201cservice\u201d, then so too should Indian registration.\n[109] Pursuant to section 10 of the Indian Act, bands have the ability to control their own membership in accordance with their own membership rules. Band membership, insofar as bands have indeed chosen to exercise that control, is therefore a regulated not by the Indian Act itself but by a set of rules as allowed by the legislation. A challenge to membership is, in this context, therefore not a challenge to legislation and as such, can more readily be considered as a \u201cservice\u201d, provided by the band, pursuant to section 5 of the Act. For reasons already stated, the same cannot be said of Indian registration, the terms of which are explicitly delineated in the Indian Act. As such, the scope of what does or does not constitute a \u201cservice\u201d is not defined by the relationship between the individual and the state as argued by the Commission, but rather by the examining whether what is being challenged constitutes a direct attack on Parliament\u2019s act of legislating, something best achieved with the Charter, or an alleged discriminatory practice pursuant to section 5 of the Act and the above-stated reasons.\nVII. Conclusion [110] Although this reasoning does not lead to a decision in the Complainant\u2019s favour, I do not wish to diminish the suffering that Mr. Andrews and his family state to have endured as a result of the government\u2019s enfranchisement policies. While the Complainants cannot challenge the impugned sections of the Indian Act pursuant to the Act, they may still choose to do so pursuant to the Charter as per Murphy. This was done successfully in the McIvor case, for example, for sections 6(1)(a) and 6(1)(c) of the Indian Act. The Tribunal is not, however, the appropriate forum to hear this challenge in this case.\n[111] I would therefore answer questions A. and B. in the following manner:\nA. Do the complaints involve the provision of services customarily available to the general public within the meaning of section 5 of the Act; or, are the complaints solely a challenge to legislation?\nAnswer: The complaints are solely a challenge to legislation.\nB. If the complaints are solely a challenge to legislation, does the Act allow for such complaints?\nAnswer: No.\nIn light of these answers, I do not need to address questions C. and D., namely\nC. Has the Complainant established a prima facie case of discrimination? and\nD. If so, has the Respondent demonstrated that the prima facie discrimination did not occur as alleged or that the practice is justifiable under the Act?\n[112] For these reasons, the Complaints are dismissed.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nSeptember 30, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1686\/4111, T1725\/8011\nStyle of Cause: Roger William Andrews and Roger William Andrews on behalf of\nMichelle Dominique Andrews v.

Canadian National Railway 2010 CHRT 23, I have come to the following conclusions.\n[2] The parties will file written submission on the following issues:\n1. What is the proper methodology for calculating lost wages owing to Ms Seely?\n2. Is Ms Seely entitled to receive payment in lieu of benefits she did not receive (extended health and benefits; dental benefits; accident insurance; life insurance) and if so, the amount of compensation to which she is entitled?\n[3] I wish to remind the parties that they had ample opportunity during the hearing of this complaint to submit evidence and file documents in regards to lost wages. They choose not to. They felt that once the merit of the case was determined that they would be able to come to an agreement on the matter and they therefore asked the Tribunal to render an order setting out, in general terms, the procedure that should be followed. This explains paragraph 183 of the Tribunal\u2019s decision which states:\n[183] The complainant seeks compensation for all wages and benefits lost pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Considering my conclusion as to the date of reinstatement, I order that the Complainant be compensated for all lost of wages and benefits from March 1st, 2007 to today. The parties are ordered to calculate the amount of wages owing using the formula provided for in the Collective Agreement. In regards to extra payments that a road Conductor could receive, since it would be difficult for the Tribunal to set an amount, it is ordered that the parties establish this amount by looking at the extras that were paid for the period to a Conductor with similar seniority working in the terminal, assuming that that Conductor had no unusual absences. The parties could, for example, take into consideration the extra payments that were paid to the employee who was set up in Jasper in March 2006. [The emphasis is ours.]\n[4] The parties were therefore asked to collaborate in order to establish the amount due to the complainant. The reference in the above paragraph to the employee set up in Jasper in March of 2006 was given as an example and nothing else. It might be that this employee is the appropriate comparator, assuming as the decision sets out that he has \u201cno unusual absences.\u201d Canadian National Railway (CN) is in the best position to bring forward evidence that this is the case and that is why I indicated during the Case Management Conference Call held on August 28, 2013, that it would be asked to proceed first and set out, with supporting evidence, how it had proceeded to establish the amount owed to the complainant. The complainant would then be asked to respond to CN\u2019s argument and indicate, if it chooses to do so, why it feels that the procedure used by CN is inadequate. CN will then have an opportunity to reply. On the basis of these arguments I will render a decision whether or not the methodology proposed by CN for the calculation of loss wages is appropriate.\n[5] I therefore order that CN\u2019s arguments be filed by November 15th, 2013. The complainant will then have until January 15th, 2014, to file its response. CN\u2019s will then have until January 30th to file its reply.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 2, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1355\/8508\nStyle of Cause: Denise Seeley v.

Complaint & Motion to adjourn. 1\nII........... Background. 1\nIII......... Positions of the parties. 5\nIV......... Analysis. 6\nV........... Ruling. 9\nI. Complaint & Motion to adjourn [1] According to the Complainant, a non-active member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), he has been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) as a result of a duty related traffic accident. As a result of his PTSD, the Complainant says the Department of Veterans Affairs awarded him a partial disability pension on February 23, 2004.\n[2] The Complainant claims his employer, the Respondent in this case, failed to accommodate his PTSD. According to the Complainant, this failure to accommodate his PTSD exacerbated his symptoms and culminated in his inability to work.\n[3] As a result, the Complainant claims the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [CHRA], on the ground of his disability.\n[4] This matter is currently scheduled for hearing from October 7, 2013 to October 25, 2013 in Vancouver, British Columbia. On September 30, 2013, the Respondent requested the hearing be adjourned.\nII. Background [5] This matter was referred to the Tribunal on August 2, 2012. After an offer to attempt to mediate the complaint was denied, the Tribunal actively case managed the file in preparation for hearing.\n[6] A Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) was held on February 4, 2013. During that call, all parties confirmed that they had disclosed their files in full. Aside from some contention on the venue of the hearing, no other issues were identified by the parties and, therefore, dates for the hearing were set.\n[7] Another CMCC was held on April 19, 2013. No disclosure issues were identified by the parties; nor any issues related to the Complainant\u2019s disability pension.\n[8] The Tribunal held a further CMCC on July 10, 2013. At that time, the Respondent brought forward four items: the status of an agreed statement of facts; the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to deal with future loss; the availability of the Complainant\u2019s Veterans Affairs pension file; and, the scope of the Complainant\u2019s proposed witness list.\n[9] With regard to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to deal with future loss, the Tribunal requested written submissions and set a schedule for doing so, followed by a CMCC scheduled for September 30, 2013.\n[10] For the Veterans Affairs pension file, the Complainant indicated that he made an Access to Information Act request for the file and would discuss the matter with the Respondent once a response to the request was provided. The Respondent indicated that late production of these materials may prejudice its case. The Tribunal asked that the parties advise it if there were any developments on the issue prior to the conference call scheduled for September 30, 2013.\n[11] Regarding the scope of the Complainant\u2019s proposed witness list, the Respondent indicated that it may seek to have some of the subpoenas quashed. The parties agreed to discuss the issue between them and, if an agreement could not be reached, the Respondent would file a motion to quash the subpoenas. The Tribunal reminded the parties that a motion can be filed at any time; however, to preserve the integrity of the process, outstanding issues need to be resolved expeditiously, if possible. The Tribunal indicated that the more outstanding issues that arise at this stage in the process, the more it can impact the hearing and potentially create delays.\n[12] On August 12, 2013, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that it will no longer bring a motion regarding the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to award future loss, and resolved to provide those submissions as part of its final arguments following the hearing. Therefore, leading up to the next CMCC, the Tribunal wrote to the parties on September 19, 2013 as follows:\nThe agenda for the Case Management Conference Call to be held on September 30, 2013 at 10:30 a.m. (Pacific), 1:30 p.m. (Eastern) is as follows:\n1. Quashing subpoenas for 2 witnesses\nThe parties are asked to be prepared to provide an update to the Tribunal. In the event this remains a live issue, the parties are requested to be fully prepared to make oral submissions on this specific issue to allow the Tribunal member if possible, to make an oral ruling on the call to expedite matters.\n2. Agreed statement of facts and\/or Agreed book of documents\n3. Other outstanding matters\nThe parties are asked to be fully prepared to give a complete update to the Tribunal on any outstanding issue and be fully prepared to make oral submissions on any outstanding issue, if it is already known by both parties, to allow the Tribunal member if possible, to make an oral ruling on the call to expedite matters.\n4. Vacating the October 25 hearing date\n[13] Prior to the CMCC, the Respondent indicated the scope of the Complainant\u2019s witness list and its potential request to quash subpoenas was no longer a live issue. However, on September 25, 2013, the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal:\nCounsel for the Respondents have advised that they intend to apply to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) for a stay of the hearing, pursuant to s. 111 of the Pension Act - on the basis that the CHRT hearing should be stayed until Cst. Fraser has reapplied for a Veteran\u2019s Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) pension (\u201cVA Pension\u201d) in relation to the events which form the subject matter of the CHRT complaint and the Court Action.\nCst. Fraser will object to that Application.\nAny Application pursuant to s. 111 of the Pension Act, should be delivered in writing to the CHRT and Counsel for Cst. Fraser and for the Canadian Human Rights Commission immediately and at least 2 clear business days before the September 30th Case Management Conference.\n[14] The Tribunal responded to the Complainant\u2019s correspondence on September 26, 2013:\nDear Counsel,\nTribunal Member Sophie Marchildon has reviewed the correspondence below from Mr. Beasley.\nGiven the upcoming hearing, and ensuring that the Conference Call proceeds in an efficient manner, Member Marchildon asks the Respondent to advise the Tribunal, in writing, on how they intend to proceed on this issue and to provide additional details, by end of day tomorrow (September 27, 2013) to allow sufficient time for review before the call.\n[15] The Respondent provided its response on September 26, 2013:\nPlease be advised that the Respondent yesterday received from Complainant\u2019s Counsel a letter dated September 24, 2013 enclosing a CD with 734 pages of records held by Veterans Affairs Canada. Previously we received, on September 17, 2013, a CD with copies of records held by Veterans Review Appeal Board. The Respondent has been waiting for disclosure of these records for a significant period of time and will need to conduct a thorough review of them prior to making a final determination as to whether Section 111 of the Pension Act applies. While we will endeavour to complete this task as soon as practicable the Complainant\u2019s suggested timeline for delivery of application materials is unreasonable.\n[16] During the September 30, 2013 CMCC, the Respondent requested that the upcoming hearing of the matter, scheduled for October 7 to 25, 2013 be adjourned. The parties provided oral submissions during the CMCC and confirmed they were satisfied they had a full and ample opportunity to present their case on the adjournment request.\n[17] Following the September 30, 2013 CMCC, the Respondent sent the following letter to the Tribunal:\nWe understand the Member will be deciding the adjournment request by tomorrow. Further to today\u2019s conference call, and in the event that the Tribunal declines the respondent\u2019s adjournment request and decides to bifurcate the hearing scheduled to commence on October 7, 2013, the respondent has the following suggestion regarding the timing of the hearing and its motion.\nThe hearing is currently scheduled for almost 3 full weeks. If the question of damages is bifurcated, than all 3 weeks should not be necessary at this time. Given the late production of the VA pension materials, it will be difficult for the respondent to bring its motion on October 7, 2013 for all the reasons discussed on this morning\u2019s call. Consequently, our suggestion is that, if the Tribunal decides not to grant the adjournment request and decides to bifurcate the hearing, the hearing should not commence until October 15, 2013 at the earliest thus giving the respondent time to review the VA materials, determine whether s.111 of the Pension Act applies and if so, to bring the application. The expectation would be that if the documents support such an application, the respondent would bring it on October 14, 2013.\n[18] The Respondent\u2019s letter reflects its submissions made at the CMCC earlier that same day.\n[19] The Complainant responded as follows:\nThe Complainant, Stuart Fraser, objects to the delivery of that letter, and to the request in the letter. Member Marchildon closed submissions on the adjournment request. Prior to closing submissions, she asked the parties if there were other submissions. The DOJ did not raise any further submissions.\nThe Complainant has subpoenaed witnesses for the hearing beginning on October 7. Some of those witnesses are not available in the week of October 15 or October 21.\nIII. Positions of the parties [20] The basis for the Respondent\u2019s request is that it received additional disclosure from the Complainant on September 17 and 25, 2013. The latter being approximately 734 pages of record and provided less than two weeks before the scheduled hearing. According to the Respondent, it needs an opportunity to fully review those records in order to make full answer and defence to the Complainant\u2019s allegations. The Respondent also would like an opportunity to review and consider the documents in order to determine whether it will bring an application to stay this matter pursuant to section 111 of the Pension Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-6. The Respondent says the late disclosure and short timeframe to review documents does not allow sufficient time to fully consider the documents and to decide whether a stay under section 111 of the Pension Act applies. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Complainant\u2019s failure to provide ongoing disclosure and production of documents as is necessary is the reason for the late disclosure and the resultant request to adjourn.\n[21] The Complainant says he is prejudiced by the Respondent\u2019s last minute request to adjourn. He is prepared to proceed and wants to proceed with the hearing. According to the Complainant, the Respondent received the initial disclosure of his documents more than a year ago. While additional documents were requested in July 2013, those documents were not in the possession of the Complainant and, therefore, he does not view them as encompassed by his ongoing disclosure obligation. In any event, the Complainant says it did what it could to get those documents to the Respondent expeditiously in September 2013. Therefore, in the Complainant\u2019s view, the request to adjourn could have been made much earlier and the Respondent\u2019s delay should not prejudice the Complainant in proceeding with his case.\n[22] The Commission opposes the request to adjourn. Specifically related to the potential for a stay application under section 111 of the Pension Act, the Commission argues the Respondent could have raised this issue at the Commission stage pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) of the CHRA. Alternatively, it could have argued the issue as part of it statement of particulars before the Tribunal and provided the Complainant an opportunity to reply. The Commission says it is now too late, a week before the hearing, to be bringing these issues forward.\nIV. Analysis [23] As reflected in the parties\u2019 correspondence prior to the September 30, 2013 CMCC, their positions on the adjournment submitted orally during the call, and their letters following the call, there seems to have been confusion on whether the Respondent was seeking an adjournment because of the late disclosure or pursuant to section 111 of the Pension Act. Now having reviewed all these submissions, it is clear that the Respondent seeks an adjournment because of the late disclosure.\n[24] That said, the late disclosure may result in the Respondent bringing a section 111 Pension Act stay application later on in these proceedings. However, that is a potential issue for another day, when the Respondent determines whether section 111 of the Pension Act applies and brings a motion in that regard. Therefore, this ruling will not address any issues related to section 111 of the Pension Act.\n[25] Moving on to the adjournment request, it is well established that the Tribunal is the master of its own procedure and the adjournment of proceedings falls within its discretion. This discretion must be exercised with consideration for subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA and the requirement that proceedings be conducted informally and expeditiously, subject to the rules of natural justice (see Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at paras. 14-17; Zhou v. National Research Council, 2009 CHRT 11 at para. 4 [Zhou]; L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railway Company, 1999 CanLII 19862 (CHRT) at para. 6; Marshall v. Cerescorp Co., 2011 CHRT 5 at para. 11; Blain v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2012 CHRT 13 at paras. 12-15; and, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2013 CHRT 16 at para. 50).\n[26] In fulfilling the Tribunal\u2019s mandate to proceed expeditiously, I also consider the Tribunal\u2019s comments in Zhou, at paragraph 8, to be relevant to the circumstances of this case:\nThe Tribunal must run an efficient hearing system in order to achieve its legislative mandate to hear and resolve complaints expeditiously (s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA; Canada Post Corporation v. PSAC and the CHRC, 2008 FC 223 at para. 274; Nova Scotia Construction Safety Association, Collins and Kelly v. Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission and Davidson, 2006 NSCA 63 at para. 76. A hearing requires the dedication of considerable financial and human resources. Those resources cannot be reallocated without significant disruption to the whole system, especially at this stage in the process. Such disruptions have an impact on the timeliness not only of the present case, but also of other cases in the system. For those reasons, an adjournment is granted only in cases where proceeding will clearly have an impact on the fairness of the hearing.\n[27] Therefore, in my view, the considerations which the Tribunal must weigh in deciding to exercise its discretion to grant an adjournment in this case include:\n(a) the prejudice caused to the Complainant in delaying this matter;\n(b) the prejudice caused to the Respondent, in proceeding without delay, without the benefit of having fully reviewed and considered the additional disclosure documents, and having to prepare its case in a short timeframe; and,\n(c) the impact to the Tribunal system in delaying the proceedings and\/or having to find additional hearing dates suitable to the Tribunal, the parties and the witnesses.\n[28] As these considerations demonstrate, there is no obvious solution to the issue at hand. At least one, if not all parties, will suffer a prejudice regardless of the decision taken.\n[29] In balancing both parties\u2019 interests, I find that the Complainant would be prejudiced the most if we do not proceed as planned. He is ready to proceed; and, all the witnesses have been summoned and are prepared for the hearing. If the current hearing schedule is adjourned beyond the dates planned, the Tribunal\u2019s schedule would only allow for the Complainant to be heard, at the earliest in March 2014. This does not best address the Complainant\u2019s right to be heard in a timely fashion and the Tribunal\u2019s mandate to proceed as expeditiously as possible pursuant to subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA. In addition, it would also affect the Tribunal\u2019s resources for this and other cases as described in Zhou above given the fact that 3 consecutive hearing weeks have been set aside for October 2013 since early February 2013.\n[30] That said, I understand the prejudice expressed by the Respondent as well. There is no perfect way to address this. While some of the late disclosed documents may relate to the substance of the complaint and\/or the remedies sought by the Complainant, given the Respondent\u2019s suggestion that a section 111 Pension Act stay may apply, it seems there is an overarching concern regarding the Complainant\u2019s disability pension and the potential for double recovery. In any event, the documents are not before me and I cannot determine their relevance to any particular issue in the case at this time. However, to address the potential of a section 111 Pension Act stay application, it may be beneficial to separate the evidence on the substance of the complaint from the evidence related to remedies. That said, the potential for a motion on section 111 of the Pension Act is not sufficient to adjourn the whole of the hearing.\n[31] Thus being said, the hearing shall proceed as planned. However, the portion of the hearing on the potential remedies to be awarded may be bifurcated after I have heard further submissions on this issue at the commencement of the hearing. Parties will be asked to have instructions on possible dates for the hearing on remedies for early next year.\n[32] To address the late disclosure, the Respondent will have the possibility of recalling witnesses, subject to submissions from the parties and my ruling thereon. Furthermore, the Respondent can raise any issues related to prejudice during the hearing, and following submissions from the parties, I will rule on the issue. This may result in a short adjournment of half a day, or a day or two, pending on the nature of the objection raised.\n[33] Therefore, the Complainant should bear in mind that in starting to present its evidence at the hearing, if its late disclosure impacts the Respondent\u2019s case, it could potentially delay the hearing even though the current adjournment request was denied.\nV.

Background\n[1] On August 16, 2010, Mr. Brian Blodgett (\u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a Complaint (\u201cthe Original Complaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) against his employer, GE \u2013 Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc. (\u201cRespondent\u201d). The Original Complaint is based on age discrimination, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c H-6, as amended (\u201cthe Act\u201d).\n[2] On June 28, 2012, the Complainant filed another complaint with the Commission (\u201cthe Second Complaint\u201d), alleging ongoing discrimination, and harassment and retaliation by the Respondent against the Complainant for filing the Original Complaint, contrary to sections 14(1) and 14.1 of the Act.\n[3] On September 24, 2012, by letter (\u201cthe referral letter\u201d), pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act, the Commission asked the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the Original Complaint, attaching a copy of it to the referral letter.\n[4] The Complainant belongs to a union (\u201cthe Union\u201d). His employment is governed by a collective agreement between the Union and the Respondent (\u201cCollective Agreement\u201d).\n[5] On December 14, 2012, the Complainant filed his Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d), plus a Motion to Amend his Complaint (\u201cMotion\u201d or \u201cMotion to Amend\u201d). This Ruling is on the Motion to Amend.\n[6] On January 11, 2013, the Respondent filed its SOP. Because the Complainant\u2019s Motion to Amend had not been scheduled or decided at that time, the Respondent\u2019s SOP does not address the Disputed Amendments (see below) or the Second Complaint.\nII. The Original Complaint\n[7] The Original Complaint alleges that there was a \u201c\u2026trend of age discrimination [by the Respondent] towards [the Complainant] that began in 2008\u201d. The Complainant believes he is being denied opportunities and discriminated against because of age.\n[8] The Original Complaint sets out the following allegations of age discrimination against the Complainant on account of age:\ndenial of a West Shift job assignment, October 2009;\ndenial of laser engraving training, May 14, 2010;\ndenial of a West Shift opportunity, October 2008.\nIII. The Second Complaint\n[9] The Second Complaint, filed June 28, 2012, alleges the following incidents:\ndenial of a West Shift job assignment on or about July, 2011, and threatening and intimidating behaviour by the Respondent\u2019s manufacturing supervisor which also constituted retaliation contrary to sections 7 and 14.1 of the Act;\nharassment and intimidation by the Respondent\u2019s management in January, 2012;\ndenial of an Orange Badge training opportunity in June, 2012, which the Complainant alleges was another example of the Respondent\u2019s \u201congoing\u201d age discrimination against him, contrary to section 7 of the Act.\nIV. Complainant\u2019s Motion to Amend\n[10] The Motion to Amend the Original Complaint seeks to add two (2) groups of complaints to the Original Complaint:\nthose in the Second Complaint; and\ntwo allegations of discrimination based on age, which are alleged to also constitute retaliation for filing the Original Complaint, specifically:\nRespondent\u2019s termination of Complainant as Team Leader of his group (\u201cTeam Leader Role\u201d) in August, 2010 (the precise month is disputed); and\ndenial of a temporary Quality Assurance Engineering Assistant position and cross\/training (\u201cQAEA position\u201d) in January, 2011.\n[11] The amendments sought are in paragraphs 9 through 32 of the Motion, as detailed at paragraphs 33 to 61 of the Complainant\u2019s SOP.\n[12] I will refer collectively to the second group of amendments as the \u201cDisputed Amendments\u201d, and separately as the \u201cTeam Leader Role Removal\u201d and the \u201cQAEA position\u201d respectively.\nV. Written Submissions after the Oral Hearing of Motion\n[13] On May 1, 2013, I heard the oral portion of the Motion to Amend. After completion of the parties\u2019 oral submissions, I requested written submissions on these cases: Kanagasabapathy v. Air Canada, 2013 CHRT 7 (\u201cAir\nCanada \u201d); Attorney General of Canada v. Alain Parent and The Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2006 FC 1313 (\u201cParent\u201d); and\nCanada\n(Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Telephone Employees Assn. (2002 FCT 776) (\u201cCTEA\u201d). The Complainant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s position on these cases, and my analysis and conclusion regarding them are further below in this Ruling.\nVI. Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s Position at Motion\n[14] Counsel for the Commission was present for the Motion. The Commission did not take any position with respect to the Disputed Amendments. Commission counsel did however provide information regarding the law and process, which was very helpful to the Motion.\nVII. Law on Amending Complaints\n[15] Subsection 48.9(2) of the Act gives the Tribunal \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d regarding the \u201cconduct of proceedings\u201d (Parent, supra). This includes the granting or dismissing of motions to amend a complaint.\n[16] The Tribunal has a wide discretion to grant amendments in order to determine \u201c\u2026the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d, if granting the amendments would be in the interests of justice, (Parent, para 30). However, granting the amendment must not prejudice the other parties (Parent, para 40).\n[17] An amendment also cannot result in a new complaint, and must be linked, at least by the complainant, to allegations giving rise to the original complaint (Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 (\u201cTran\u201d), at paras 17-18. There must be a nexus, in fact and in law, between the complaint and the amendment sought.\n[18] Whether or not to grant a motion to amend a complaint depends, therefore, not only on \u201c\u2026the Act but on an assessment of the facts. It is therefore a question of mixed law and fact.\u201d (Parent, para 19)\nVIII. Respondent\u2019s Position re the Second Complaint; Post-Motion Events\n[19] In paragraph 2 of the Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion, the Respondent \u201cdoes not oppose\u201d the inclusion of the Second Complaint into the Original Complaint.\n[20] However, the Respondent submits that notwithstanding the Complainant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s consent to add the Second Complaint to the Original Complaint, the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to so order because the Commission has not referred the Second Complaint to the Tribunal, pursuant to s. 49(1) of the Act.\n[21] At the May 1, 2013 oral hearing of this Motion, the parties advised that they had both filed written consents with the Commission to have the Commission refer the Second Complaint to the Tribunal, without Commission investigation.\n[22] On August 13, 2013, the Tribunal Registry Office advised me that it had received the Commission\u2019s letter referring the Second Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry, with the Second Complaint attached to the referral letter.\n[23] It is therefore not necessary to discuss or rule on the jurisdiction issue the Respondent raised. This Order will grant that part of the Complainant\u2019s Motion to Amend which asks to include the Second Complaint in the Original.\nIX. Complainant\u2019s Self Representation\n[24] When the Complainant filed both the Original and Second Complaints, he did not name anyone as his representative or counsel. The Complainant\u2019s Reply to Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion states at para 14 that \u201cMr. Blodgett was self-represented\u201d. At para 43, it states that:\nAs a lay person navigating the process, Mr. Blodgett at points did not comprehend the ideal manner in which to incorporate all of his allegations\u201d\u2026and \u201cassumed that because he had formally complained about the denial of the QUAE opportunity to Ms. Falconi [of the Commission], that this allegation was included as part of the substance of his Original Complaint.\n[25] Whether or not the Complainant consulted a lawyer or otherwise sought legal advice before November 2012 is not disclosed, but for the purposes of this Motion, I accept that he was self-represented until November 2012, when his counsel came on record.\n[26] However, in my view, in this particular case, this fact alone does not assist him. The Complainant has chosen English as the language for his Complaints and correspondence; he seems quite competent in that language; there is no submission that he cannot understand the written or spoken word; he is responsive to written questions from the Commission; his letters to the Commission are not disorganized. These facts mitigate against the Complainant being so disadvantaged at the Commission stage simply because he did not have counsel that this alone should serve to permit the amendments he seeks.\n[27] I will however take the fact that the Complainant did not have counsel when he filed both Complaints into account as one of the factors to weight in deciding whether or not to grant the Motion regarding the Disputed Amendments, although I do not give it much weight.\nX. Respondent\u2019s Position re Disputed Amendments\n[28] The Respondent opposes the granting of that part of the Motion seeking to include the Disputed Amendments on the following grounds:\nthey are out of time as they are beyond the one year time limit in Subsection 41(1)(e) of the Act provides a one year time limit between an alleged breach of the Act and the filing of a complaint about it and the Disputed Amendments are therefore out of time;\ngranting the Team Leader Role Removal amendment would constitute an abuse of process, because the Complainant and the Respondent settled the Complainant\u2019s January, 2010 grievance about the Team Leader Role Removal;\nthe Team Leader Role Removal occurred before the actual filing of the Original Complaint, and therefore cannot constitute retaliation under section 14.1 of the Act;\na sought-after amendment must be partof the \u201cessential situation\u201d of the Original Complaint, and the Disputed Amendments do not meet that test;\nthe inclusion of the Disputed Amendments would cause fundamental and irreparable prejudice to the Respondent.\nXI. The Time Limit in s. 41(1) of the Act\n[29] Section 41(1) of the Act states that the Commission has a mandatory obligation to deal with any complaints filed with it, subject to the exclusions set out in subsections 41(1)(a) through (e). Subsection 41(1)(e) contains a one year time limit between an alleged breach of the Act and the filing of a complaint about it.\nA. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[30] The Respondent submits that 41(1)(e) precludes the inclusion of the Disputed Amendments into the Original Complaint, because they are out of time.\nB. Analysis\n[31] I note that 41(1)(e) further states that the Commission has the authority and discretion to extend the one year time limit to \u201c\u2026such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances\u2026\u201d.\n[32] I therefore conclude that the one year time limit is not a hard and fast, automatic bar. Rather, the wording permits the Commission, and therefore the Tribunal, to look at the circumstances in deciding whether or not to exercise its discretion and extend the time limit to what it considers appropriate.\n[33] I have taken into account the following circumstances:\nthe two year delay re the QAEA position and the two and one-half year delay re the Team Leader Role Removal in specifying that the Disputed Amendments were at issue, in accordance with Commission and Tribunal procedure;\nwhen the Complainant filed the Original Complaint on August 16, 2010, his grievance about Leader Pay was still in process;\nhe alleges that the Respondent\u2019s Human Resources (\u201cHR\u201d) told him he had to go through the grievance process first, before going to the Commission.\nI also note that in the Second Complaint, at number 2, the Complainant mentioned the Team Leader Role Removal as retaliation, although he did not specify it in a numbered, more detailed paragraph. He was still beyond the one year time period in subsection 41(1)(e) of the Act, but it was mentioned.\nThe fact that he was unrepresented meant that he did not have the same finesse as counsel in drafting his Complaints.\nAlthough the letters the Complainant wrote to the Commission in 2011 which referred to the Team Leader Role Removal and the denied QAEA opportunity were not proper notice to the Respondent of these issues, he nevertheless referred to the Team Leader Role Removal as being retaliation, and could have thought the events were then part of the whole Complaint procedure.\nThe Respondent still employs the same management personnel as were involved in the alleged discriminatory acts and retaliation in the Disputed Amendments, and are available to provide evidence.\nThe Collective Agreement, although relevant to the contents of the Complainant\u2019s Grievance, is not relevant to the subsection 41(1)(e) time limitation in the Act.\n[34] For the above reasons, I find that it is reasonable in the circumstances to extend the time limit in subsection 41(1)(e) to the date of the Complainant\u2019s filing of this Motion to Amend. The Tribunal is not barred by subsection 41(1)(e) from considering this Motion.\nXII. Issue of Whether Team Leader Role Removal Constitutes Retaliation\n[35] Section 14.1 of the Act states:\nIt is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\nA. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[36] The Complainant submits that because on May 18, 2010, he notified the Respondent\u2019s HR contact that he intended to file a human rights complaint with the Commission, the Respondent\u2019s subsequent removal of him as Team Leader was retaliation as defined in the Act.\n[37] The Complainant states that the Commission incorrectly advised him that the Team Leader Role Removal could not have been retaliation because \u201cit occurred before GE was notified of his complaint by the Commission\u201d and submits, in essence, that the Commission should have viewed the Complainant\u2019s May OK 2010 communication to the Respondent\u2019s HR department of his intention to file with the Commission as actual notice of his filing. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s removal of him as Team Leader constituted retaliation under section 14.1 of the Act.\nB. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[38] The Respondent submits that given the wording of section 14.1, the Team Leader Role Removal cannot be retaliation under s. 14.1, because it happened before the Complainant filed the Original Complaint on August 16, 2010.\nC. Analysis\n[39] The fact is that the Complainant was removed from the Team Leader Role. In the materials, there is conflicting evidence which raises unanswered questions about the circumstances and timing of this event. For example, the evidence raises questions such as who was told what and when; what was discussed at an October 29, 2010 meeting about the Grievance; what constitutes notice of a human rights complaint.\n[40] In light of this, whether or not the Team Leader Role Removal constituted retaliation under the Act is not something which I think can or should be decided at this stage of the proceeding, but rather after a fuller account of the circumstances has been provided during the hearing.\nXIII. Abuse of Process\nA. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[41] The Respondent submits that an amendment permitting the Original Complaint to include the Team Leader Role Removal would amount to an abuse of process of both the Commission\u2019s and the Tribunal\u2019s processes, because it is barred by a binding settlement of the Complainant\u2019s grievance. In January 2011 the Respondent and Complainant settled the Complainant\u2019s grievance about the Team Leader Role Removal by an agreement that the Respondent pay the Complainant Leader Pay from October 27, 2007 to July 1, 2010. The Respondent paid the Complainant accordingly. If the Tribunal grants this amendment and the Complainant establishes his case, it will therefore be the re-litigation of a decided issue and result in a double award of damages. During the Motion\u2019s oral hearing, Respondent\u2019s counsel posited that it was understood, and the Complainant should have understood, and the settlement deemed him to understand, that the \u201cflip side\u201d of the settlement was that the Complainant stopped being Team Leader on July 1, 2010, and that the entire matter was closed.\n[42] The Respondent also states that it has dealt with the Original Complaint at the Commission level, expended resources, and made decisions based on the three specified incidents in the Original Complaint, only to find out that the Original Complaint has changed, with the Complainant trying to add two incidents that happened long ago. If the Tribunal grants the Disputed Amendments, the Complaint therefore has the potential to become, in effect, a \u201cmoving target\u201d, with a potentially never-ending list of incidents by the Complainant. This would constitute a denial of the Respondent\u2019s fundamental rights to fully deal with the Original Complaint at the Commission stage, and is an abuse of both the Commission\u2019s and the Tribunal\u2019s processes.\nB. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[43] The Complainant submits that including the Team Leader Role Removal is not an abuse of process, because the Complainant\u2019s grievance was only about Leader Pay, and not about any human rights issue arising from the Team Leader Role Removal, and therefore is not a re-litigation of a decided matter. The inclusion of the QAEA denial incident is also not an abuse of process nor does it render the Complaint a \u201cmoving target\u201d because it was in the Complainant\u2019s August 2011 letter to the Commission and therefore is a part of \u201call of the circumstances\u201d of the Complaint.\nC. Analysis\n[44] I have taken into account the following, which form part of the Complainant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s Motion materials. The Grievance (see below) is attached as Appendix \u201cA\u201d to the Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion, as are emails and letters.\non January 12, 2010, the Complainant filed grievance 2010-3 (\u201cthe Grievance\u201d) stating that the Respondent failed to pay him the five percent (5%) premium for performing as Team Leader (\u201cLeader Pay\u201d), contrary to the Collective Agreement; his requested remedy was being \u201cmade whole\u201d;\nin May 2010 he emailed HR of his intention to file a human rights complaint;\nComplainant says HR told him he had to complete the Grievance process first;\nJune 2010 HR denied Grievance for Leader Pay;\nComplainant appealed HR decision to \u201cnext level\u201d in grievance procedure;\nAugust 16, 2010, the Complainant filed Original Complaint with Commission and did not include Team Leader Role Removal;\nDecember 20, 2010 HR Vice President wrote Union that Complainant acted as Team Leader from October 27, 2007 until July 1, 2010, when removed, and offeredthe Complainant Leader Pay for that period;\nJanuary 5, 2011 email from Union to HR accepted Offer on behalf of Complainant and Union;\nRespondent paid the Complainant gross Leader Pay of $14,566.09, less deductions, as agreed.\n[45] As well, although the date of the Respondent\u2019s notification to the Complainant that he was no longer Team Leader is disputed, in any event, the Complainant filed the Grievance in January 2010, 7 months before he himself claims he was \u201caware\u201d of his removal as Team Leader in August 2010. In January, he alleges that he was performing all but one of the functions of the Team Leader Role. Therefore, in January 2010, when he filed the Grievance, the Complainant could not have addressed his mind to the Respondent\u2019s future termination of his Team Leader Role, and it was therefore not part of the Grievance.\n[46] On a plain reading of the Grievance, its subject matter was solely the past failure to pay Leader Pay, and not age discrimination or retaliation. The language in the Respondent\u2019s December 20, 2010 offer buttresses the concept that it was Leader Pay at issue, and nothing else, because Leader Pay was offered, and nothing else.\n[47] Leader Pay is not the same as most of the heads of damages and relief sought by the Complainant: reinstatement of the Team Leader Role; compensation for pain and suffering and for wilful and reckless discriminatory practice.\n[48] It is not clear to what time period the Complainant refers in para 77.3.viii of his SOP, which asks for \u201c5% lost pay premium for Leader Role in the amount of approximately $11,488.95\u201d. If at the end of the inquiry, the Complainant has established his case with respect to the Team Leader Role Removal, and the Leader Pay head of damages overlaps the period for which the Respondent paid the Complainant Leader Pay pursuant to the Grievance settlement, the Tribunal will not order any such overlapping or double payment.\n[49] The QAEA denial has never been litigated. In my view, it purports to be one of a series of events of alleged age discrimination against the Complainant. I therefore do not see its inclusion in the Original Complaint as amounting to an abuse of process.\n[50] For the reasons above, I conclude that there would be no abuse of process if the Tribunal grants the Motion to include the Disputed Amendments in the Original Complaint.\nXIV. \u201cEssential Situation\u201d Or \u201cNexus and Connection\u201d\nA. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[51] In addition to the grounds stated above regarding the Disputed Amendments, the Respondent submits that the QAEA position would have been a promotion for the Complainant, rather than a training opportunity, like the other incidents cited in the Original Complaint. Therefore, the QAEA situation dealt with different subject matter, and constituted a new complaint.\n[52] The Respondent states that the QAEA position therefore does not fall within the \u201cessential situation\u201d of the Original Complaint, which essential situation the Respondent states is encompassed by the three incidents alleged in the Original Complaint, which all involved training or assignment opportunities within the Complainant\u2019s position. The Respondent cites Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 (\u201cTran\u201d), where the Tribunal refused to grant amendments because the amendments did not fall within the \u201cessential situation\u201d of Ms. Tran\u2019s original complaint.\n[53] The Team Leader Role Removal is also outside the \u201cessential situation\u201d. In the Respondent\u2019s view, this alleged reprisal (which the Respondent characterizes as a \u201cpre-existing reprisal\u201d (para 37, Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion) \u201ccould and should\u201d (ibid) have been added to the Original Complaint, but was not. Therefore, it is excluded from the \u201cessential substance\u201d of the Complaint.\nB. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[54] The Complainant submits that the test for the Disputed Amendments should be whether the \u201c\u2026facts are an outgrowth of the discriminatory practices that occurred [before] the filing of the complaint\u201d and that this applies where a complainant alleges an ongoing series of events. This was the Tribunal\u2019s opinion as a result of the Tribunal hearing of Parent, 2005 CHRT 37. The Complainant submits that throughout the Original and Second Complaints, the Complainant alleges ongoing incidents of denial of opportunities on account of age discrimination. The Disputed Amendments are connected to and an outgrowth of the events and situation the Complainant alleged in the Original Complaint. The Disputed Amendments exhibit a nexus or connection to the Original Complaint and the Second Complaint in that they are part of the pattern of the age discrimination which the Complainant alleges.\nC. Analysis\n[55] In Tran, the original complaint was about discrimination based on family status and retaliation for a previous human rights complaint. The amendments Ms. Tran requested were discrimination based on sex, national or ethnic origin (later withdrawn), race, colour and section 10(a) of the Act (Tran, supra, paras 10 and 11). The Tribunal held that there was no \u201c\u2026logical connexion or nexus\u2026\u201d from the facts in the Original Complaint to \u201c\u2026the allegations of additional prohibited grounds of discrimination\u201d in the requested amendments (Tran, supra, para 17). Rather, the proposed amendments were so different from the original complaint, they constituted a \u201csubstantially new Complaint\u201d, and were denied.\n[56] Unlike in Tran, the ground of Mr. Blodgett\u2019s allegations, whether in the Original Complaint, the Second Complaint or the Disputed Amendments does not change \u2013 it is always age discrimination and differential treatment on account of age, contrary to section 7, and then, in addition, he alleges that some of these acts of discrimination based on age constituted retaliation and harassment under the Act.\n[57] Whether the test for granting the Disputed Amendments is that they be part of the \u201cessential situation\u201d of the Original Complaint, or whether the test is that they must be connected to or have a nexus with the facts in the Original Complaint if an ongoing series of discriminatory events is alleged, I find that the Disputed Amendments meet both tests. The type of discrimination alleged in the Disputed Amendments \u2013 age \u2013 does not change from the Original Complaint; the management personnel involved do not change; the group of employees in the Complainant\u2019s group do not change significantly; the incidents alleged consistently arise from the same type of situation in the workplace: the denial of assignment and training opportunities for the Complainant, allegedly on account of age discrimination. The alleged retaliation and harassment arise from the same ground of discrimination, except that the circumstances of some of the incidents also constitute harassment and retaliation, in the Complainant\u2019s view. The Disputed Amendments appear to be intrinsic parts of the narrative of the whole, which if left out, would not permit the Tribunal to fully assess the parties\u2019 evidence or obtain a complete narrative of the Complaints.\nXV. Post-Hearing Submissions on Three Cases\nA. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[58] The Complainant submits that Air Canada (supra) stands for the concept that it is the Commission\u2019s referral letter to the Tribunal and the complaint attached to it that determines whether the Commission has referred the entire complaint, and not the Commission\u2019s investigative report or other Commission documents. If the Commission wishes to limit a complaint\u2019s scope, it will use specific language to do so.\n[59] Therefore, because the Original Complaint alleges a \u201ctrend\u201d of age discrimination, any allegation related to it are within the scope of the Complaint, and the Disputed Amendments fall within that scope.\n[60] The Complainant submits that the type of amendments this Complainant seeks are the same as those successfully sought by the complainant in Parent (supra), in that the original complaint and the requested amendments were and are linked by a \u201ccommon thread\u201d \u2013 in Parent (supra), that complainant\u2019s health; in the within Complaint \u2013 age discrimination, some of which constituted retaliation and harassment under the Act.\n[61] The Complainant submits that CTEA (supra) stands for the proposition that the Tribunal should grant amendments which correct the Commission\u2019s mistakes, if there is no prejudice.\n[62] In the within Complaint, the Commission mistakenly advised the Complainant [that the Team Leader Role Removal could not be retaliation under the Act, and that he had to file a separate complaint and that is why he filed the Second Complaint], and because there is no prejudice to the Respondent if the Tribunal includes the Disputed Amendments in the Original Complaint, the Tribunal should apply CTEA and grant the Motion to Amend.\nB. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[63] The Respondent submits that Parent (supra) stands for the necessity for procedural fairness and natural justice for all the parties to a complaint. The Respondent submits that in relation to granting amendments, Parent (supra) stands for the requirement that there must be no prejudice to the respondent in order for an amendment to be granted.\n[64] To add the Disputed Amendments to the Original Complaint at this stage of the process will cause additional costs to the Respondent, and skewer the process to prejudice and cause injustice to the Respondent. The Respondent submits that contrary to Parent (supra), to include the Disputed Amendments in the Original Complaint would result in fundamental and irreparable and unjust prejudice.\n[65] The Respondent submits that Parent (supra) also confirms that the test for granting an amendment is that it must be part of the same \u201cessential situation\u201d as identified in the complaint.\n[66] The Respondent sees Air Canada and CTEA (both supra) as examples of how requested amendments must have been expressly dealt with or identified by the Commission in order for the Tribunal to add them to a complaint. The Respondent submits that because the Disputed Amendments were not specifically dealt with in one way or another by the Commission, they cannot be part of the Commission\u2019s referral to the Tribunal.\nC. Analysis\n[67] I interpret Air Canada (supra) as standing for the concept that unless the Commission clearly restricts its scope, the Commission is taken to refer the whole [my emphasis] of a complaint to the Tribunal, notwithstanding any recommendations by a Commission investigator to exclude some of the allegations put forward by a complainant.\n[68] In my view, CTEA (supra) is a case in which the Federal Court confirms the \u201cclear\u201d jurisprudence \u201c\u2026that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to amend complaints of discrimination\u201d (CTEA, at para 30). The case also confirms that although the decision to grant an amendment is discretionary, generally, an amendment should be granted \u201c\u2026in the absence of prejudice to the opposite party.\u201d (CTEA), at para 31\n[69] The Federal Court in Parent (supra) stands for the proposition that amendments that are linked by commonality \u2013 the \u201ccommon thread\u201d \u2013 to the allegations in the original complaint should be granted, barring prejudice to the other parties. Parent also confirms the Tribunal\u2019s authority to amend complaints \u201c\u2026for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d (Parent, supra, at para 30). In Parent, although the Commission had not specifically dealt with the requested amendment, the Federal Court upheld the Tribunal\u2019s decision to amend the complaint.\n[70] I conclude that as in Parent, there is a common thread between the Disputed Amendments and the Original Complaint. As in Air Canada, by including the Disputed Amendments in the Original Complaint, the whole of the Complaint will be before the Tribunal.\nXVI. Issue of Prejudice\n[71] In Parent, the Federal Court stated that \u201c\u2026an amendment should not be granted where it would unjustly prejudice the other party.\u201d (Parent, supra, para 16)\nA. Respondent\u2019s Position\n[72] The Respondent states that the Complainant delayed 2.5 years regarding the Team Leader Role Removal and 2 years from the QAEA incident before he sought these amendments. These delays inherently and fundamentally prejudice the Respondent, who has lost the opportunity to compile and preserve evidence, both documentary and through witnesses whose memories have faded. That loss can never be compensated. Further, the Respondent has lost the opportunity to address the allegations \u201cin a timely manner\u201d.\n[73] The Respondent also submits that this delay means that the Commission has not properly dealt with these allegations, which have not even been filed with the Commission. The Respondent says that to permit the Disputed Amendments would constitute an \u201cend run\u201d around the required Commission process, and deny the Respondent the Commission\u2019s investigation and conciliation procedures.\nB. Complainant\u2019s Position\n[74] The Complainant submits that the party pleading prejudice must show \u201creal and significant\u201d prejudice which is of \u201csufficient magnitude to impact on the fairness of the hearing\u201d, as in Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002, CHRT CanLII 45929 (\u201cCook v. Onion Lake\u201d).\n[75] The Complainant submits that delay in and of itself does not equate to prejudice. The Complainant denies delay occurred in any event, because as soon as possible after the Complainant retained counsel, the Complainant delivered the Motion \u2013 at the same time in December 2012 as Complainant\u2019s SOP. The Respondent has therefore known about the Disputed Amendments since at least that time.\nC. Analysis\n[76] I do not know at which stage in the Commission process the Second Complaint was when the Commission received the Complainant\u2019s and Respondent\u2019s consents to immediate referral to the Tribunal, but the Respondent\u2019s consent indicates a willingness to dispense with the Commission\u2019s processes in certain circumstances. It was reasonable for the Respondent to deal with the Second Complaint as it did, and the Respondent did not raise the issue of prejudice. I conclude that in these circumstances as well, as in Parent, supra, the fact that some of the Commission\u2019s processes may be by-passed will not be an \u201cend run\u201d around the Commission\u2019s processes, and will not prejudice the Respondent. Mediation and settlement discussions are available to the parties at the Tribunal, at any time they wish. They are not only available at the Commission.\n[77] Further, in addition to the above, I have considered that the same management personnel who were involved in the decisions to remove the Complainant as Team Leader and not to offer him the QAEA position are still in the Respondent\u2019s employ and can give evidence, including at the hearing. I have also considered that the Second Complaint refers to the Team Leader Role Removal as retaliation and the Respondent has known about the Second Complaint since about October 2012. Further, the Respondent has known since December 2012 that the Complainant was motioning to amend the Complaint. The Respondent\u2019s SOP can address the Disputed Amendments (as well as the Original and Second Complaints), and the Respondent can also provide documentary evidence regarding them. As well, in order to alleviate any inconvenience the granting of the Disputed Amendments might cause to the Respondent, the Tribunal can give the Respondent extra time to file its SOP and documents.\n[78] I therefore find that the Respondent will not be prejudiced if the Disputed Amendments are granted and granting them will not impact the fairness of the hearing.\n[79] I wish to note that the granting of the within Motion to Amend does not change the Complainant\u2019s burden of establishing his case, including these amendments, at the hearing. As the Federal Court stated in Parent, supra (para 14), the Complainant \u201c\u2026will have the burden of proving\u2026\u201d his case \u201c\u2026later on\u201d.\nXVII. Order\nOn consent of the Parties, the Original Complaint is amended by adding to it the Second Complaint.\nThe Original Complaint is amended by adding to it the Disputed Amendments, as more particularly set out in the Complainant\u2019s Motion to Amend at paragraphs 9 through 25.\nIf, on completion of the inquiry, the Complainant has established that the Respondent removed him as Team Leader on the prohibited grounds of discrimination on account of age, or as retaliation, contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Complainant shall not be entitled to, and the Tribunal shall not make, an order that the Respondent pay the Complainant 5% Leader Pay for the period October 27, 2007 to July 1, 2010.\nThe Respondent is directed to serve and file an amended Statement of Particulars in response to the Original Complaint, as hereby amended, by a date that is six (6) weeks from the date of this Ruling.\nThe Complainant is directed to serve and file any Reply to the Respondent\u2019s amended Statement of Particulars, by a date that is ten (10) days from the date that Complainant\u2019s counsel is served with the Respondent\u2019s amended Statement of Particulars.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 3, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files:\nT1866\/9612 & T1947\/2713\nStyle of Cause:\nBrian Blodgett v.

Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at para. 18).\n[3] On September 17, 2013, the Respondent indicated that it takes no position with respect to the Complainant's motion to amend, except for the proposed amendment to remedy #11 of her Statement of Particulars.\n[4] Remedy #11 in the Complainant's Statement of Particulars requests:\nAny other remedies I may request and this Tribunal may award.\n[5] The Complainant wishes to add to this remedy as underlined below:\nAny other remedies I may request and this Tribunal may award. I seek the flexibility to amend my remedies at a future date based on the evidence presented at the Tribunal hearing.\n[6] According to the Respondent, insofar as the Complainant seeks leave to make further amendments without formal motion, the proposed amendment to remedy #11 is improper.\n[7] I agree. Any future proposed amendment shall have to be submitted by way of motion and then analyzed by the Tribunal based on the submissions of the parties. This ensures each party has a full and ample opportunity to be heard on the issue. Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s request to add to remedy #11 as indicated above is denied.\n[8] Seeing as the Respondent takes no position on the other amendments proposed by the Complainant, her motion to add remedies related to wage loss and promotion\/wage loss, as outlined at paragraphs 2 and 3 of her Notice of Motion, are granted. The Complainant\u2019s request to amend her systemic remedy, as outlined at paragraph 5 of her Notice of Motion, is also granted.\n[9] As a result, and to ensure the Respondent has an opportunity to respond to the Complainant\u2019s amended remedies, the parties are directed to file amended Statements of Particulars, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). This includes the disclosure of any additional documents and\/or witnesses.

Ulyatt\nDate: October 16, 2013\nCitation: 2013 CHRT 26\n[1] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) has filed a motion for disclosure by way of a motion dated September 18, 2013.\n[2] The Commission has argued that the requests are relevant to the issues, facts and\/or remedies before the Tribunal of this case. The Commission, in its brief, has set forth the facts which are based on the disclosure and the Respondent argues that the requests are not disclosure documents but an attempt to exercise a discovery process.\n[3] On June 28th, 2013, the Commission requested disclosure of relevant information including, but not limited to, the following:\na) The number of Elders at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at the time of this complaint and their spiritual\/traditional background and\/or religious denomination;\nb) The spiritual\/traditional background and\/or religious denomination of the Elders CSC assigned to work with the Complainants;\nc) The number of priests at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at the time of this complaint and their religious denomination;\nd) The number of other religious leaders (non-Aboriginal and non-Christian) at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at the time of this complaint and their religious affiliations;\ne) Any document electronic or otherwise related to the restriction of the use of pipes and smudging within CSC\u2019s facilities, including smudging in cells; and\nf) Any information related to human rights or sensitivity training provided to CSC\u2019s employees with respect to accommodation of Aboriginal inmates\u2019 spiritual and cultural needs;\n[4] The Commission has indicated in its brief that items a) and c) are no longer being pursued. Counsel for the Respondent, Mr. Staska, has advised that the Respondent has provided the Commission with information requested in paragraph 11. (f) of the Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure.\n[5] Counsel for the Commission, Mr. Warsame, confirmed that the only outstanding issues are those outlined in paragraph 11. b), 11. d) and 11. e) of the Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure dated September 18, 2013. The Commission, in its brief, relied on the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure provided at Rule 6 in arguing that the parties must disclose all arguably relevant materials to the matter of the hearing. Rule 6 states the following:\nd) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relates to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and form of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n[6] The Commission has argued that the threshold for relevancy is a low threshold and the Respondent must make full disclosure.\n[7] The Commission, in its brief, also sites case law to support its request for disclosure including Tannis et al. v. Calvary Publishing Corp and Glen Robbins, 2000 BCHRT 26, 38 C.H.R.R. D\/277 at para. 44, Brady v. Interior Health Authority, 2005 BCHRT 200 (CHRR Doc. 05-246) at paras. 51, 54, and Metcalf. V. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 882 and others (No.7), 2005 BCHRT 165 at para. 11 (Tabs 6, 7 and 8 of the Commission\u2019s brief);\n[8] Fundamental to the claim is the Canadian Human Rights Act and the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, which quantifies rules of natural justice.\n[9] In reviewing the request made by the Commission, respecting items 11. b) and 11. d), I find that the requests are more discovery requests rather than disclosure. Furthermore, I find that the information requested by the Commission has already been provided by the Respondent in its submissions in the response to the Commission\u2019s motion.\n[10] The outstanding issue of paragraph 11. e) of the Commission\u2019s motion for disclosure is certainly proper documentation that ought to be disclosed to the Commission and to the Complainants.\n[11] The Tribunal thereby orders the Respondent to disclose to the Commission and to the Complainants any document electronic or otherwise related to the restrictions of the use of pipes and smudging within CSC\u2019s facilities, including smudging in cells.\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Complaint and request for direction. 1\nII........... Background. 1\nIII......... Positions of the parties. 5\nIV......... Direction. 7\nI. Complaint and request for direction [1] The Complainant claims the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council have received and continue to receive inferior policing services in comparison with non-First Nations communities in Canada. According to the Complainant, this amounts to discrimination on the basis of race, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act).\n[2] The following ruling is to provide the parties with direction regarding ongoing issues related to the disclosure of documents.\nII. Background [3] On October 1, 2012, the Complainant brought a motion seeking an order for further and better disclosure from the Respondent.\n[4] Submissions on the motion were completed on November 16, 2012. In an attempt to expedite the disclosure process, the Tribunal issued an order for the disclosure of the additional documents requested by the Complainant, with reasons to follow, on December 21, 2012:\n1. The Respondent shall disclose all documents requested by the Complainants in Table A of its October 1, 2012 Motion Record; or, confirm that the documents requested do not exist.\na. With specific regard to the documents requested at paragraph 5(a) of Table A of the Complainants\u2019 October 1, 2012 Motion Record, the Respondent is to disclose all documents outlining the process by which staffing and funding levels are set in remote or isolated communities served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP). The request is for general RCMP policy documents, and the individual staffing and funding levels of each remote or isolated community need not be disclosed.\nb. With specific regard to the documents requested at paragraph 5(b) of Table A of the Complainants\u2019 October 1, 2012 Motion Record, the Respondent is to disclose all documents outlining the process by which staffing and funding levels are set in remote or isolated communities served by First Nations police forces operating under the federal government\u2019s First Nations Policing Policy. The request is for general policy documents under the First Nations Policing Policy, and the individual staffing and funding levels of each First Nations police force need not be disclosed.\nc. With specific regard to the documents requested at paragraph 11 of Table A of the Complainant\u2019s October 1, 2012 Motion Record, the Respondent is to disclose all documents outlining the standards of the RCMP governing service levels; facilities; equipment; wages, benefits, and isolation pay; and, any standards specific to policing in remote or isolate communities. The request is for general RCMP policy documents, and the individual standards governing specific First Nations or non-First Nations communities need not be disclosed.\n2. The Respondent shall disclose all documents in its possession for the time period covering 2007 to the present, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the present case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by the other parties; or, confirm that the documents requested do not exist.\n3. Pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d) and 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure\n(03-05-04), the Respondent shall provide the other parties with a consolidated list of documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed. This consolidated list shall include all non-privileged documents disclosed to date and any non-privileged documents disclosed pursuant to orders 1 and 2 above.\n4. Pursuant to Rule 6(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), the Respondent shall produce to the other parties a copy of the documents identified in the consolidated list under order 3 above. Each document produced shall be clearly titled or labelled to correspond with the consolidated document list to allow the Complainant to easily identify and consult the document.\n5. The documents produced under order 4 above shall be unredacted. If documents cannot be produced in unredacted form, the Respondent shall provide an explanation thereof.\n6. Pursuant to Rule 6(1)(e) and 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure\n(03-05-04), the Respondent shall provide the other parties with a consolidated list of documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed. The Respondent shall provide an explanation for each privilege claimed. This consolidated list shall include all privileged documents disclosed to date and any privileged documents disclosed pursuant to orders 1 & 2 above.\n7. The Respondent shall complete orders 1 to 6 above by February 15, 2013.\n[5] The Tribunal\u2019s reasons for issuing this order, Grand Chief Stan Louttit in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council and Grand Chief Stan Louttit in his personal capacity v. Attorney General of Canada, 2013 CHRT 3 [Louttit], were released on January 16, 2013.\n[6] On February 15, 2013, the date set in the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order for the disclosure of the additional documents requested by the Complainant, the Respondent requested an extension to March 15, 2013 to comply with the order. As the Complainant and Commission did not oppose the extension, it was granted by the Tribunal.\n[7] Assuming the additional disclosure was completed on March 15, 2013, the Tribunal scheduled a case management conference call (CMCC) for April 19, 2013 to discuss other matters in the file in preparation for a hearing of the matter. However, on April 18, 2013, the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal indicating that it had yet to receive any further disclosure from the Respondent pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s order of December 21, 2012 and requested that a penalty be levied against the Respondent.\n[8] In response, the Respondent indicated that due to the volume of material and the complexity of the task of fulfilling the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order, more time was needed to complete the disclosure process. The Respondent indicated it would provide the additional disclosure by May 17, 2013.\n[9] The Complainant agreed not to pursue a penalty against the Respondent for not complying with the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order as long as the Respondent provided its full and complete disclosure by May 17, 2013.\n[10] On May 21, 2013, the Respondent produced additional disclosure to the parties and provided a consolidated list of the documents it had disclosed to date. There was no indication in the consolidated list, or otherwise, as to which documents had been disclosed previously and which documents were disclosed in response to the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order.\n[11] On June 19, 2013 the Tribunal, in an effort to expedite matters and, in the absence of any follow-up from the parties since May 2013 on the issue of compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 ruling, requested a CMCC be scheduled for early July or mid-September 2013. The CMCC was scheduled for September 16, 2013, the purpose of which was to discuss the status of disclosure, any outstanding issues and to finalize details for a hearing.\n[12] Prior to the CMCC, in the early afternoon of September 16, 2013, the Complainant advised the Tribunal that it would be making a request during the call for the Respondent to explain, in a list, how it has responded to the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order. Although the Complainant had yet to complete its review of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure package, it indicated that it appeared there were a considerable amount of missing materials. The Complainant suggested that, after the Respondent indicated which of the documents were intended to respond to the Tribunal\u2019s order, it would be in a better position to assess the adequacy of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure package.\n[13] During the September 16, 2013 CMCC, counsel for the Complainant and counsel for the Respondent agreed to discuss ongoing issues related to disclosure amongst them. The Tribunal encouraged the parties to raise issues in as timely a manner as possible and scheduled a further CMCC for October 3, 2013 to receive an update from the parties.\n[14] During the CMCC on October 3, 2013, the Complainant indicated it still had ongoing issues with the disclosure provided by the Respondent and that the parties were unable to resolve those issues.\nIII. Positions of the parties [15] The parties provided their positions on how best to address the ongoing disclosure issues in this matter during the October 3, 2013 CMCC.\n[16] Based on its initial review of the documents provided by the Respondent, the Complainant says it appears there are documents missing. However, it is difficult for the Complainant to know for sure without the Respondent indicating which documents it views as responding to each aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s order. Therefore, the Complainant asks the Respondent to explain, in a list, how it has responded to the Tribunal\u2019s order in 2013 CHRT 3. After the Respondent has indicated which of the documents are intended to respond to the Tribunal\u2019s order, the Complainant says it will be in a better position to assess the adequacy of the Respondent\u2019s disclosure package.\n[17] According to the Complainant, this would be the most efficient way of addressing the disclosure issues. Rather than the Complainant guessing which documents were disclosed to address each aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s order, the individuals who compiled the documents for the Respondent would be in a better position to indicate this more quickly, because presumably they have already performed this task in compiling the disclosure materials. Similarly, the Complainant says it would be far less work for the Respondent to indicate which documents were disclosed to address each aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s order than it would be for the Complainant to attempt to identify which documents may be missing. One reason for this is that, due to the previous disorganized disclosure provided by the Respondent, the Complainant is unable to identify which documents were previously disclosed and which documents have now been disclosed to address the Tribunal\u2019s order.\n[18] The Complainant adds that, although there is no rule in the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) requiring the Respondent to create a list indicating how it has responded to the Tribunal\u2019s order, it is within the Tribunal\u2019s authority to make such a direction to ensure an expeditious and orderly hearing process.\n[19] Alternatively, the Complainant says it could bring a motion for additional disclosure. However, in the Complainant\u2019s view, this would be a less efficient way of addressing the disclosure issues.\n[20] The Commission points out that regardless of the procedure taken to address the disclosure issues in this matter - whether the Respondent is directed to explain, in a list, how it has responded to the Tribunal\u2019s order or, alternatively, the Complainant brings a motion in this regard - the Respondent will be required to provide an explanation as to how it has fulfilled the Tribunal\u2019s disclosure order in 2013 CHRT 3. As the Respondent has already performed the task of compiling materials in response to each aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s order, the Commission says the Respondent is best placed to indicate which documents it has provided to satisfy the order, presumably with minimal work.\n[21] On the other hand, the Respondent invites the Complainant to indicate which documents it thinks are missing or are inadequate. Once the Complainant has done so, the Respondent can then inquire into and indicate whether there are or are not more documents. As opposed to the Complainant and Commission\u2019s point of view, the Respondent says it would be a lot of work to go back through the disclosed materials, read each document, and determine which documents are new and what aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s order they address. Therefore, in the Respondent\u2019s view, it would be more practical and cost efficient for the Complainant to go through the disclosed materials and indicate what is inadequate. While the Respondent does not question the Tribunal\u2019s authority to make the direction requested by the Complainant, it says it is unprecedented.\nIV. Direction [22] In its December 21, 2012 order, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to disclose the additional documents requested by the Complainant. The Tribunal also ordered the Respondent to produce a consolidated list of all documents disclosed to the Complainant, including any documents disclosed to the Complainant following the ruling. The basis for ordering the consolidated list was:\nProducing an unorganized CD, with unindexed and unsorted documents, inhibits the Complainants\u2019 ability to rely upon or address evidence that the Respondent finds relevant to the present case. Furthermore, the unorganized First Disclosure CD has inhibited the timely and efficient presentation of arguments and evidence in this case. The parties have been unable to move past the disclosure stage of these proceedings since March 2012. While the unorganized First Disclosure CD may not be the sole reason for this, it has been a contributing factor. In fact, the Respondent has pointed out that some of the documents being requested in the current motion have already been provided to the Complainants. Perhaps if the documents had been produced in a more efficient manner in the first place, the current motion, or at least aspects of it, may have been unnecessary and these proceedings could have advanced more expeditiously.\n(Louttit at para. 14)\n[23] Similar issues arise again in the context of the current request for directions. While the Respondent has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s order to produce a consolidated list of documents, the consolidated list alone does not allow the Complainant to determine whether the Respondent has complied with the main aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s order: to disclose additional documents. In this regard, I note that the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order provided:\n1. The Respondent shall disclose all documents requested by the Complainants in Table A of its October 1, 2012 Motion Record; or, confirm that the documents requested do not exist.\n(emphasis added)\n[24] While the Respondent was not explicitly directed to indicate which additional documents were provided to address each aspect of the Complainant\u2019s request, implicit in this direction was an understanding that the Respondent would somehow indicate how it had complied with the Tribunal\u2019s order to disclose additional documents. Despite the fact that the Respondent was asked to indicate whether any of the documents requested did not exist, it now invites the Complainant to indicate which documents it thinks are missing or are inadequate. This is not in line with the spirit of the Tribunal\u2019s order or disclosure in general:\nWhile the Rules do not specify the manner or form by which production is to take place, the purpose of the Rules and the principles of fairness in general dictate that the disclosure and production of documents be sufficient to allow each party the full and ample opportunity to be heard.\n(Louttit at para. 14)\n[25] Neither the Act nor the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) specifically address the situation brought forward by the current request for direction. However, in the absence of a specific statutory direction, it is well established that the Tribunal is master of its own procedure. In determining an appropriate procedure in this situation, I note that pursuant to subsection 48.9(1) of the Act proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[26] At this stage, the Complainant is unable to determine whether the Respondent has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2013 order for additional disclosure. This order created an obligation on the Respondent to disclose documents to allow the Complainant the full and ample opportunity to be heard. The Respondent has not fully complied with that obligation. Considering it gathered the additional documents, it is also in the best position to indicate how those documents responded to the Tribunal\u2019s order and the Complainant\u2019s request for disclosure, as opposed to the Complainant endeavouring to do so. It is not uncommon for sophisticated\nparties, such as the Attorney General of Canada, to be able to track its own disclosure and to indicate how it has complied with a Tribunal order regarding disclosure. If the Respondent were unable to do so, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Tribunal and the other parties to verify compliance with a disclosure order.\n[27] Therefore, I believe the most expeditious way of moving past the current disclosure issue would be for the Respondent to identify which documents it disclosed in compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order. While perhaps inconvenient to the Respondent, proceeding in this manner has no effect on the Respondent\u2019s right to a fair hearing in this matter. As a result, the Tribunal directs as follows:\n(1) The Respondent is directed to indicate in writing to the Tribunal and all parties, in an unequivocal manner, how it has complied with the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order. Specifically, what additional documents it provided on May 21, 2013 and how those documents respond to each request in Table A of the Complainant\u2019s October 1, 2012 Motion Record.\n(2) The Respondent will provide its response to direction 1 above by December 9, 2013.\n(3) Within (4) weeks of receiving the Respondent\u2019s response to direction 1 above, the Complainant is directed to indicate, in writing to the Tribunal and all parties, whether there are any outstanding issues with regard to the Respondent\u2019s compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s December 21, 2012 order.\n(4) After receiving the Complainant\u2019s response to direction 3 above, a conference call will be scheduled to discuss any outstanding issues and to attempt to set hearing dates.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 17, 2013\n",

Complainant & Motion. 1\nII........... Request for electronic documents at the hearing. 1\nIII......... Ruling. 3\nI. Complainant & Motion [1] The Complainant is a federal prisoner in the Respondent\u2019s custody. According to the Complainant, he suffers from multiple mental disabilities. He claims the Respondent has pursued policies or practices that are discriminatory to prisoners with mental disabilities and that it does not adequately accommodate their needs. On this basis, the Complainant believes the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice, within the meaning of section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act], on the basis of his disability.\n[2] In preparation for the upcoming hearing of this matter, the Respondent brought a motion requesting that all documents at the hearing be filed in electronic format. The following ruling deals with the Respondent\u2019s motion.\nII. Request for electronic documents at the hearing [3] Usually, at a Tribunal hearing where the Commission is participating, a party wishing to introduce a document into evidence would bring five copies of that document. That is, one for each of the two other parties, one for the witness, one for the Tribunal Registry and one for the Tribunal Member.\n[4] The Respondent asks that all documents at the hearing be in electronic form. In the alternative, it asks that instead of providing five copies of the documents it wishes to introduce into evidence, it be permitted to provide only two. This would give the Tribunal the usual two paper copies and the parties and the witness could use electronic documents; or, paper copies should they wish to print the materials that were provided to them electronically at their own cost.\n[5] According to the Respondent, it has already produced approximately 5,500 documents and anticipates that it will have produced over 9,000 documents before the start of the hearing of this matter. The Respondent estimates the cost of producing five paper copies of these documents to be approximately $20,000.00. While it may not be necessary to file all these documents into evidence, the Respondent claims that even if a fraction of the documents produced were filed, this volume would be significant enough to warrant a departure from the traditional binders and paper format. The Respondent further argues that there would also be added costs for transporting, storing and managing five paper copies of its documents, which could add another few thousand dollars to the overall cost.\n[6] In order to reduce these costs, the Respondent offers to provide and pay for a projection screen for all parties to use for the purpose of displaying electronic documents at the hearing. It is also agreeable to providing a computer loaded with all of the electronic documents for use by witnesses. The Respondent also proposes to load \u201c.pdf\u201d copies of all documents on each party\u2019s laptop for their use. All documents, whether in electronic or paper format, would be named and numbered in the same fashion. For example, documents in paper format would have tabs 001, 002, 003 to 10,000, while documents in electronic format would be saved under the names 001, 002, 003 to 10,000; therefore, clicking to open electronic document named 8346 would be no different than opening tab 8346 in a set of binders.\n[7] The Respondent submits that there is no prejudice to any of the parties by proceeding with electronic evidence, as each party is free to print, at their own cost, the Respondent\u2019s documents should they wish to do so. Having regard to the principle of proportionality, the maximum allowable order for pain and suffering under subsection 53(e) of the Act, and the goal of reducing litigation costs to all, the Respondent claims it is in the interest of justice that it be relieved from the need to produce five copies of its documents at the hearing of this matter.\n[8] The Complainant and the Commission oppose the Respondent\u2019s motion. They take the position that not all of the documents disclosed will need to be introduced as evidence. In this regard, the Commission points out that the cost of $20,000.00 advanced by the Respondent assumes that all the documents it has disclosed need to be filed in evidence, which is not necessarily the case. The same rationale applies to any additional costs the Respondent claims will be incurred for transporting, storing and managing the documents. The Commission is also of the view that the amount allowable for pain and suffering pursuant to subsection 53(e) of the Act is irrelevant with respect to deciding this motion.\n[9] The Commission and the Complainant are concerned that the use of electronic documents at the hearing will prejudice their ability to efficiently locate documents during both cross-examination and preparation. The Commission adds that the Respondent\u2019s proposal to provide electronic \u201c.pdf\u201d copies of documents does not address the need to easily locate these documents during the hearing. Moreover, the Commission notes that the Respondent has not addressed the issue of technical support should the proposed projector and\/or presentation computer malfunction during the hearing.\n[10] The Commission argues that the Respondent has not identified any prejudice that the established practice of filing paper exhibits would have on its ability to present its case. Both the Commission and the Complainant propose that the Respondent could reduce its costs by producing an agreed statement of facts, printing documents double-sided and providing only one copy of documents to the Tribunal.\nIII. Ruling [11] The Tribunal does not have rules or guidelines pertaining to the use of electronic documents at a hearing. In the absence of such, the Tribunal controls its own procedures, as long as they comply with the rules of fairness (see Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 560 at pp. 568-569). In this regard, subsection 48.9(1) of the Act also provides for proceedings before the Tribunal to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[12] The Respondent\u2019s request for the use of electronic documents is based on cost. It has not identified any prejudice to its ability to present its case by using paper documents. On the other hand, both the Complainant and Commission have raised legitimate fairness concerns regarding the Respondent\u2019s proposed use of electronic documents. Those fairness concerns cannot be remedied by simply asking the Complainant and Commission to print hard copies of the materials at their own cost. In any event, asking the Complainant and Commission to do so would only divert cost from one party to the others.\n[13] Given that both the Complainant and Commission do not consent to the use of electronic documents at the hearing, that they have raised fairness concerns in that regard and, in the absence of Tribunal rules or guidelines on the use of electronic documents at a hearing, the present motion cannot be granted in its entirety. The Respondent\u2019s cost concerns cannot outweigh the Tribunal\u2019s mandate to ensure a fair hearing.\n[14] The Complainant and the Commission have suggested some practical options to reduce the amount of material that may be required at the hearing of this matter by double-sided printing of documents and by providing an agreed statement of facts and an agreed book of documents. I encourage the parties to pursue these options in order to reduce the potential costs associated with this litigation.\n[15] I would also be open to reducing the amount of copies of documents required to be filed at the hearing from five (5) to three (3) (a copy for each opposing party and one for the Tribunal\u2019s record). In the event that the Respondent is still interested in presenting its own case electronically, I could follow the Respondent\u2019s evidence in electronic format. Should I require a hard copy of specific documents at the end of the hearing, I will ask the Respondent for one.\n[16] I would add that, since the hearing is scheduled to take place in intermittent one-week blocks, it is very unlikely that the whole of the Respondent\u2019s evidence will be required every week. In transporting only the materials it may need for that specific week, the Respondent may further be able to reduce any costs associated with transporting, storing and managing those documents.\n[17] As a result, and for the reasons above, the Respondent\u2019s motion to file its evidence in electronic format only is dismissed; however, the possible alternatives outlined above can be explored at the next conference call.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 18, 2013\n",

H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d). Pursuant to sections 7 and 14.1 of the Act, the Complainant alleged that, in the context of his employment, the Respondent had denied him promotional opportunities as a form of \u201creprisal\u201d for having filed a grievance in 2000 and a previous human rights complaint that was substantiated in 2002, and that it had treated him differently on the grounds of race, colour and national or ethnic origin. Complaint 1 outlines events occurring from December 2006 to May 19, 2008. On January 11, 2012, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Act, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry in respect of the complaint. The exact scope of Complaint 1 was the subject of a ruling by the Tribunal (see 2013 CHRT 7).\n[2] On May 9, 2012, the Complainant filed with the Commission another complaint T1945\/2513 (Complaint 2) against the Respondent, pursuant to sections 7 and 14.1 of the Act. In Complaint 2, the Complainant alleges further discrimination by the Respondent, in the same vein as in Complaint 1, this time outlining events alleged to have occurred between 2010 and April 2012. In addition to the grounds alleged in Complaint 1, in his second complaint the Complainant also alleges discrimination on the basis of age.\n[3] On May 2, 2013, a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) was held in which the Respondent made a request to put Complaint 1 in abeyance pending the referral to the Tribunal by the Commission of Complaint 2. Since Complaint 2 was not before the Tribunal and the Complainant was not on the call, only his counsel was on the call and was unaware of a second complaint; and, since the Commission could not advise on the second complaint; the Tribunal found it had no jurisdiction at the time to consider the second complaint. Furthermore, there was no way of knowing when, or even if, the second complaint would be referred to the Tribunal. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s request to put Complaint 1 in abeyance was denied. On the call, the Tribunal directed the parties to file their Statements of Particulars and established a schedule for doing so, ending on June 20, 2013.\n[4] On June 17, 2013, the Commission referred Complaint 2 to the Tribunal.\n[5] Following that referral, the Tribunal canvassed dates for a CMCC with the parties. The parties confirmed their availability for October 3, 2013.\n[6] The October 3, 2013 CMCC was cancelled at the Commission\u2019s request and for unforeseen circumstances.\n[7] In letters dated October 17, 2013 and November 4, 2013, the Tribunal asked the parties to indicate whether they would be in favour of joining Complaints 1 and 2 for the purpose of having a single hearing. In response to the Tribunal\u2019s October 17, 2013 and November 4 letters, all parties agreed that the complaints be joined.\nLaw & Analysis [8] Pursuant to section 40(4) of the Act, it is the Commission who has the power to determine whether complaints should be dealt with together through a single inquiry by the Tribunal. However, the issue of whether to hold a single hearing or multiple hearings is a procedural matter (see Lattey v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 2002 CanLII 45928 (CHRT) at para. 12 [Lattey]). With regard to procedure, section 48.9(2) of the Act provides that the Chairperson of the Tribunal may make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal. Furthermore, section 48.9(1) indicates that proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. Together, these two sections indicate that, as long as its procedure is fair, the Tribunal is master of its own procedure. Therefore, the Tribunal can determine whether a single hearing or multiple hearings should be held with regard to the two complaints in issue here.\n[9] In Lattey, in determining whether the complaints in issue in that case should be heard together, the Tribunal identified that it must balance a number of factors, including:\n1. The public interest in avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, including considerations of expense, delay, the convenience of the witnesses, reducing the need for the repetition of evidence, and the risk of inconsistent results;\n2. The potential prejudice to the respondent that could result from a single hearing, including the lengthening of the hearing for each respondent as issues unique to the other respondent are dealt with, and the potential for confusion that may result from the introduction of evidence that may not relate to the allegations specifically involving one respondent or the other; and\n3. Whether there are common issues of fact or law.\n(see Lattey at para. 13)\n[10] Considering the circumstances of these two complaints, I find that hearing both complaints together would expedite the proceedings and would be in the public interest. Both complaints contain similar allegations of discrimination, and Complaint 2 is essentially a continuation of Complaint 1 with the addition of other events that are alleged to have occurred. Hearing both complaints together would give the Tribunal a clear historical and factual context to the complaints, which will form the basis of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on each legal and factual question. Considering that the parties to both complaints are the same, unlike in Lattey, there will be no confusion in the introduction of evidence related to only one of the complaints as per the second factor outlined in Lattey. In addition, both complaints are at similar stages of the inquiry, all parties consent to consolidate the files, and any delay with consolidating the hearings can be reduced through active case management.\n[11] I also find instructive the decision in Entrop v. Imperial Oil Limited (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186, stating that it \u201cwould be impractical, inefficient and unfair to require individuals to make allegations of reprisals only through the format of separate proceedings.\u201d While Complaint 2 is not a complaint of reprisal for having made Complaint 1, it alleges a continuation of the discrimination alleged in Complaint 1. Therefore, it would be practical and efficient to hear these two complaints together.\n[12] The exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of natural justice, and the regime of the Act. I am of the view that consolidating the two complaints better accords with natural justice and advances the legislative objectives of the Act, in particular, expeditiousness, and the granting to all parties of a full and ample opportunity to participate in the inquiry process (see ss. 48.9(1) and 50(1) of the Act).\n[13] For all the above reasons, I direct that Complaints 1 and 2 be consolidated for the purposes of a single hearing.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 12, 2013\n",

H-6 (the Act), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Grand Chief Stan Louttit, in his personal capacity, and in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council (the Complainants). The Complainants assert that they have received and continue to receive inferior policing services in comparison with non-First Nations communities in Canada. According to the Complainants, this amounts to discrimination on the basis of race, pursuant to section 5 of the Act by the Attorney General of Canada (the Respondent).\n[2] The following ruling deals with a motion for disclosure by the Complainants with regard to the above mentioned complaint.\nI. Background [3] Pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (the Rules), each party is to serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out, among other things, a list of documents in the party\u2019s possession that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case. On March 2, 2012, the Respondent provided a Statement of Particulars, with a document list (the First Document List) and disclosure package (the First Disclosure CD).\n[4] The Complainants requested further disclosure from the Respondent and, following an extension of time to do so, the Respondent provided a supplementary document list (the Second Document List) and disclosure package (the Second Disclosure CD).\n[5] Despite the supplementary disclosure, the Complainants assert the Respondent has failed to provide a complete document list and has failed to provide complete copies of many documents listed in its document list.\n[6] Following a Case Management Conference Call on August 8, 2012, the parties agreed to attempt to resolve the disclosure issue informally. As those attempts were unsuccessful, on October 1, 2012, the Complainants brought the present motion seeking an order for further and better disclosure from the Respondent.\n[7] Submissions on the motion were completed on November 16, 2012. The Commission did not take a position.\n[8] On December 21, 2012, the Tribunal issued the following order with regard to the present motion:\n1. The Respondent shall disclose all documents requested by the Complainants in Table A of its October 1, 2012 Motion Record; or, confirm that the documents requested do not exist.\na. With specific regard to the documents requested at paragraph 5(a) of Table A of the Complainants\u2019 October 1, 2012 Motion Record, the Respondent is to disclose all documents outlining the process by which staffing and funding levels are set in remote or isolated communities served by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP). The request is for general RCMP policy documents, and the individual staffing and funding levels of each remote or isolated community need not be disclosed.\nb. With specific regard to the documents requested at paragraph 5(b) of Table A of the Complainants\u2019 October 1, 2012 Motion Record, the Respondent is to disclose all documents outlining the process by which staffing and funding levels are set in remote or isolated communities served by First Nations police forces operating under the federal government\u2019s First Nations Policing Policy. The request is for general policy documents under the First Nations Policing Policy, and the individual staffing and funding levels of each First Nations police force need not be disclosed.\nc. With specific regard to the documents requested at paragraph 11 of Table A of the Complainant\u2019s October 1, 2012 Motion Record, the Respondent is to disclose all documents outlining the standards of the RCMP governing service levels; facilities; equipment; wages, benefits, and isolation pay; and, any standards specific to policing in remote or isolate communities. The request is for general RCMP policy documents, and the individual standards governing specific First Nations or non-First Nations communities need not be disclosed.\n2. The Respondent shall disclose all documents in its possession for the time period covering 2007 to the present, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the present case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by the other parties; or, confirm that the documents requested do not exist.\n3. Pursuant to Rule 6(1)(d) and 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure\n(03-05-04), the Respondent shall provide the other parties with a consolidated list of documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed. This consolidated list shall include all non-privileged documents disclosed to date and any non-privileged documents disclosed pursuant to orders 1 and 2 above.\n4. Pursuant to Rule 6(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), the Respondent shall produce to the other parties a copy of the documents identified in the consolidated list under order 3 above. Each document produced shall be clearly titled or labeled to correspond with the consolidated document list to allow the Complainant to easily identify and consult the document.\n5. The documents produced under order 4 above shall be unredacted. If documents cannot be produced in unredacted form, the Respondent shall provide an explanation thereof.\n6. Pursuant to Rule 6(1)(e) and 6(5) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure\n(03-05-04), the Respondent shall provide the other parties with a consolidated list of documents in the Respondent\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed. The Respondent shall provide an explanation for each privilege claimed. This consolidated list shall include all privileged documents disclosed to date and any privileged documents disclosed pursuant to orders 1 & 2 above.\n7. The Respondent shall complete orders 1 to 6 above by February 15, 2013.\n[9] The following are the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for issuing that order.\nII. Ruling [10] Pursuant to the rules of natural justice and subsection 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. This requires the disclosure of arguably relevant evidence between the parties. If there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues, or forms relief identified by the parties, it should be disclosed pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules (see Guay v.Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34 at para. 42; and, Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28 at\npara. 4). In this regard, I also note the purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules, which is to ensure that:\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner; and\n(c) all proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\n(subsection 1(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules)\n[11] With these principles in mind, the following are the grounds raised by the Complainants in support of the present motion, and the Tribunal\u2019s ruling thereon.\nA. The First Disclosure CD is Incomplete and Inadequate [12] The Complainants submit the First Disclosure CD is incomplete and inadequate because many documents in the First Document List were not included on the CD and the documents on the CD do not correspond to the numbering in the First Document List. According to the Complainants, the CD mainly contains large PDF files, which appear to each contain multiple, unindexed and unsorted documents. The Complainants claim the lack of organization in the First Disclosure CD makes document review difficult. They submit that the requirement to provide documents under Rule 6(4) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) presumably includes an obligation to do so in a manner that would allow the receiving party to locate and confirm the identity of documents disclosed. Therefore, the Complainants seek a disclosure CD or binder from the Respondent that is organized in a workable manner and contains all of the documents listed in its First Document List.\n[13] According to the Respondent, it has provided disclosure to the Complainants on March 2 and July 5, 2012. The Respondent asserts it is not required to re-organize documents that have already been provided to the Complainants.\n[14] While the Rules do not specify the manner or form by which production is to take place, the purpose of the Rules and the principles of fairness in general dictate that the disclosure and production of documents be sufficient to allow each party the full and ample opportunity to be heard. Producing an unorganized CD, with unindexed and unsorted documents, inhibits the Complainants\u2019 ability to rely upon or address evidence that the Respondent finds relevant to the present case. Furthermore, the unorganized First Disclosure CD has inhibited the timely and efficient presentation of arguments and evidence in this case. The parties have been unable to move past the disclosure stage of these proceedings since March 2012. While the unorganized First Disclosure CD may not be the sole reason for this, it has been a contributing factor. In fact, the Respondent has pointed out that some of the documents being requested in the current motion have already been provided to the Complainants. Perhaps if the documents had been produced in a more efficient manner in the first place, the current motion, or at least aspects of it, may have been unnecessary and these proceedings could have advanced more expeditiously.\n[15] Therefore, in the interests of fairness and efficiency, and given the orders for additional disclosure below, I believe the most expeditious way to address the issue of the unorganized First Disclosure CD would be for the Respondent to produce consolidated lists of documents pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Rules. The consolidated lists shall include all documents disclosed to date and any additional documents disclosed pursuant to the orders below. Any documents produced to the Complainants pursuant to subsection 6(4) of the Rules should be clearly titled or labeled to correspond with the consolidated document list to allow the Complainant to easily identify and consult the document.\nB. The documents disclosed contain redactions [16] The Complainants assert many of the documents provided in the First and Second Disclosure CDs are redacted; and, the Respondent has not provided a justification for the redactions appearing in the documents. Therefore, the Complainants seek an order that the Respondent provide complete versions of documents that are not redacted.\n[17] The Respondent acknowledges many of the documents provided to the Complainants were in redacted format. The Respondent has agreed to review the documents to ascertain whether unredacted versions of these documents exist and, if so, whether they can be provided to the Complainants.\n[18] While the Respondent has agreed to review documents to determine whether unredacted versions can be provided, the Complainants point out that the Respondent has not agreed to provide the unredacted versions of the documents. Therefore, if no order is made, it would be open to the Respondent to simply advise it will not provide unredacted documents, thus necessitating further submissions and delay. Therefore, according to the Complainants, an order is warranted.\n[19] While the Respondent has agreed to review the documents provided to ascertain whether unredacted versions of these documents exist and, if so, whether they can be provided to the Complainants, nevertheless, I find it necessary to make an order in this regard. The Tribunal\u2019s Rules distinguish between privileged (Rule 6(1)(e)) and non-privileged (Rule 6(1)(d))\ndocuments. Only non-privileged documents are required to be produced to the other party\n(Rule 6(4)). That is because the only limitation on the Tribunal\u2019s ability to admit or accept evidence is if the evidence is subject to any privilege under the law of evidence (see subsection 50(4) of the Act). Otherwise, subject to subsection 50(5) of the Act, the Tribunal can receive and accept any evidence and other information that it sees fit (see paragraph 50(3)(c) of the Act). While in certain situations the Tribunal may take measures to protect the privacy or confidentiality of disclosed information, usually by request of one of the parties, the Respondent has not requested that any privacy or confidentiality measures be taken with regard to any of the documents it has produced to the Complainants. Nor has the Respondent explained why redactions appear in some of the produced documents.\n[20] Therefore, the Respondent is ordered to provide unredacted versions of all documents produced to the Complainants. If documents cannot be produced in unredacted form, the Respondent shall provide an explanation thereof.\nC. Request for further disclosure [21] The Complainants assert the two document lists provided by the Respondent appear to be missing relevant documents that likely exist. According to the Complainants, the federal government negotiates the policing agreements governing policing in the Mushkegowuk communities, conducts assessments of First Nations policing, has significant oversight responsibilities, and operates the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP). Through these and other roles, the Complainants claim the Respondent would have a significant number of additional relevant documents. Specifically, the Complainants submit the following documents are likely in the Respondent\u2019s possession and were not included in its document lists:\n1. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Indian Policing Policy Review\n(January, 1990);\n2. Don Clairmont, Effectiveness and Sustainability in First Nations Policing (2001);\n3. Memorandum to Cabinet, \u201cIndian Policing Services for Indian and Inuit Communities\u201d;\n4. Record of Decision, \u201cIndian Policing Services for Indian and Inuit Communities\u201d;\n5. Documents outlining the process by which staffing and funding levels are set in remote or isolated communities served by:\na. The RCMP; and\nb. A First Nations police force, such as the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, operating under the federal government\u2019s First Nations Policing Policy.\n6. Documents relating to the negotiation of the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service \u201ctripartite\u201d agreements, such as:\na. Requests for additional resources and the responses thereto;\nb. Documents justifying proposed budgets or refusals to increase resources; and\nc. Internal federal government documents assessing policing needs.\n7. Assessments, reports, inspections, and photographs of officer housing in the Mushkegowuk First Nations communities;\n8. First Nations Policing Policy and Program documents, such as the most recent version of the policy, the Terms and Conditions of the program, and program guidelines and directives;\n9. Documents created in the course of the federal government\u2019s recent Comprehensive Review of the First Nations Policing Program, including the policy options created as a result of the review;\n10. Treasury Board documents discussing the quality of policing in the Mushkegowuk First Nations or in First Nations generally; and\n11. Documents outlining the standards governing the RCMP, including standards relating to:\na. Service levels;\nb. Facilities (i.e. police stations and housing);\nc. Equipment;\nd. Wages, benefits, and \u201cisolation pay\u201d; and\ne. Any standards specific to policing in remote or isolated communities.\n(i) Documents 1 and 2 [22] According to the Complainants, documents 1 and 2 contain assessments of the federal government\u2019s policing program for First Nations and are relevant to its assertion that the program is flawed and results in discriminatory treatment. The Respondent does not dispute the arguable relevance of these documents and, in fact, asserts that they have already been provided to the Complainants. Therefore, I find documents 1 and 2 to be arguably relevant to these proceedings and they should be disclosed to the Complainants as part of the Respondent\u2019s consolidated list of documents ordered above.\n(ii) Documents 3, 4 and 10 [23] The Complainants claim documents 3 and 4 contain details regarding the purpose, structure, criteria, policies and terms and conditions of the federal government\u2019s program for First Nations policing. Again, the Complainants submit these documents are relevant to its assertion that the First Nations policing program is flawed and results in discriminatory treatment. Similarly, the Complainants claim document 10 contains assessments of the quality of policing in First Nations communities, which according to the Complainants are relevant to the comparison between services for First Nations and non-First Nations communities. The Respondent submits documents 3, 4 and 10 would appear to be Cabinet confidences and as such would be protected by section 39 of the Canada Evidence Act. In reply, the Complainants assert section 39 of the Canadian Evidence Act does not apply; there has been no certification of the documents as cabinet confidences by the Clerk of the Privy Council; the documents have already been released to a third party during an evaluation of the First Nations policing program; and, it appears that the documents were created more than 20 years ago, and thus cabinet confidence protection cannot apply to them pursuant to paragraph 39(4)(a) of the Canada Evidence Act.\n[24] Again, the Respondent does not dispute the arguable relevance of documents 3, 4 and 10. I agree with the Complainants that they are rationally connected to the issues raised in this case and, therefore, should be disclosed. If documents 3, 4 and 10 are indeed Cabinet confidences, a written certification from a minister of the Crown or the Clerk of the Privy Council attesting to this fact should be provided to the Tribunal pursuant to subsection 39(1) of the Canada Evidence Act.\n(iii) Documents 5(a) and 5(b) [25] For documents 5(a) and 5(b), the Complainants claim the documents are relevant to the determination of whether service levels are unequal as between First Nations and non-First Nations communities. The Respondent submits, once the Complainants identify the comparator communities they suggest are appropriate, it will be able to address the request for documents 5(a) and 5(b). In reply, the Complainants assert they have identified a number of valid comparison groups and need not limit themselves to a discrete number of specific comparison communities as suggested by the Respondent. The Complainants add, practically speaking, the documents can be provided without the identification of specific comparison communities.\n[26] I fail to understand why specific comparator communities need to be identified for the Respondent to be able to address the request for documents 5(a) and 5(b). I understand the Complainants\u2019 request under 5(a) to be for general policy documents of the RCMP. The specific staffing and funding levels of each remote or isolated community served by the RCMP are not requested. I also understand the Complainants\u2019 request under 5(b) to be for general policy documents under the First Nations Policing Policy. The specific staffing and funding levels of each First Nations police force are not requested. Both requests are sufficiently specific and do not require further elaboration from the Complainants. The Respondent does not dispute the arguable relevance of these documents and I accept that they have a rational connection to these proceedings. Therefore, documents 5(a) and 5(b) should be disclosed.\n(iv) Documents 6, 7, 8 and 9 [27] The Respondent claims documents 6, 7, 8 and 9 have already been provided to the Complainants, and if additional documents are located they will also be provided. In reply, the Complainants request that the Respondent be ordered to provide any additional materials, or confirm that none exist.\n[28] There is no dispute that these documents are arguably relevant and I accept the Complainants\u2019 reasons for requesting them as explained in Table A of its Motion Record. Therefore, documents 6, 7, 8 and 9 should be disclosed to the Complainants; or, alternatively, the Respondent should confirm that no additional materials exist.\n(v) Document 11 [29] Finally, for document 11, the Complainants seek documents relating to RCMP standards to compare them to standards for First Nations policing. The Respondent asserts that the request is overly broad and requires further particularization with respect to the particular communities that the Complainants suggest are the appropriate comparators for the discrimination analysis. In reply, the Complainants claim specific comparison communities need not be identified to provide the requested RCMP standards.\n[30] Again, I fail to understand why specific comparator communities need to be identified for the Respondent to be able to address the request for document 11. I understand the Complainants\u2019 request to be for general RCMP policy documents. Any individual standards governing specific First Nations or non-First Nations communities are not requested. The request is not overly broad, as the Complainants have enumerated the source and type of documents it requests. No further elaboration from the Complainants is required. The Respondent does not dispute the arguable relevance of these documents and I accept that they have a rational connection to these proceedings. Therefore, document 11 should be disclosed.\nD. Post-2007 Documents [31] According to the Complainants, the Second Disclosure List does not contain any documents for the time period covering 2007 to the present. The Complainants seek documents from this period, or an explanation as to why no documents were provided from that period.\n[32] The Respondent submits, while it requested documents that post-date 2007, none have been provided to date. The Respondent states it will follow up on the request for post-2007 documents and either provide such documentation that is relevant, or provide an explanation as to why no such documentation exists.\n[33] Given that the Respondent does not oppose the Complainants request for post-2007 documents; and, given I have found that additional disclosure is required with regard to the documents above; the order will specify that any post-2007 documents should be included in any additional disclosure.\nE. Timing of Disclosure [34] In its response to the present motion, the Respondent indicated it would provide any further documentation, including unredacted versions of documents already produced, by January 14, 2013.\n[35] The Complainants are concerned about the delay involved in the Respondent\u2019s proposal to provide any further materials by January 14, 2013. This will be over one year past the initial deadline for the Respondent\u2019s documentary disclosure. However, according to the Complainants, if orders are made in relation to the documents which the Tribunal decides should be disclosed, and the parties are thus able to move beyond the disclosure stage, the Complainants do not object to the date proposed by the Respondent.\n[36] Given that the January 14, 2013 date was proposed by the Respondent despite its opposition to many aspects of the Complainants current motion; and, given that the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of additional documents and has made other consequential orders; I will give the Respondent until February 15, 2013 to comply with this ruling.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nJanuary 16, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: TT1683\/3811 and T1684\/3911\nStyle of Cause: Grand Chief Stan Louttit in a representative capacity on behalf of the First Nations of Mushkegowuk Council and Grand Chief Stan Louttit in his personal capacity v.

Complaints. 1\nII........... Request that Tribunal proceedings be adjourned. 1\nIII......... Law and Analysis. 3\nIV......... Ruling. 7\nI. Complaints [1] The Complainants allege the Respondent has engaged in a discriminatory practice on the basis of age, sex and\/or family status, contrary to s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \"CHRA\").\n[2] Specifically, the Complainants challenge the Respondent's application of s. 6(1)(c.1) of the Indian Act in denying their applications for Indian registration. Under this statutory provision, the Complainants were denied Indian registration because they were born before September 4, 1951.\nII. Request that Tribunal proceedings be adjourned [3] In April 2013, the Respondent proposed that these complaints be adjourned pending the Tribunal's decision in Matson et al. v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (T1444\/7009) [Matson] and Roger William Andrews and Roger William Andrews on behalf of Michelle Dominique Andrews v. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (T1686\/4111, T1725\/8011) [Andrews], relating to similar complaints with respect to the Respondent\u2019s application of the registration provisions of the Indian Act. The Complainants opposed the request that the Tribunal process be adjourned. The Commission proposed that the parties exchange particulars and proceed with disclosure in the normal course, with a discussion on the possibility of adjournment thereafter.\n[4] Before the Tribunal had an opportunity to rule on the parties\u2019 submissions, on May 24, 2013, the Tribunal released the Matson decision, 2013 CHRT 13. In that decision, the Tribunal dismissed the complaint, finding that the Complainant was challenging the registration provisions of the Indian Act, as opposed to any \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, offered by the Respondent. Applying the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2012 FCA 7, the Tribunal found that attacks aimed at legislation, and nothing else, fall outside the scope of the CHRA.\n[5] On August 8, 2013, the Tribunal requested \"...the parties' submissions on how they wish to proceed with their complaints moving forward\", in light of the Matson decision.\n[6] The Complainants once again opposed adjourning their complaints.\n[7] The Commission advised the Tribunal that it had filed an application for judicial review of the Matson decision. The Commission was of the view that Matson was wrongly decided and, therefore, the Tribunal should continue to process the present matters in the normal course.\n[8] Given the application for judicial review in Matson, the Respondent proposed two methods of proceeding: bifurcating the complaints into two phases - (a) jurisdiction and (b) merits - and proceeding with particulars only relevant to the first phase; or adjourning the matters pending the Commission\u2019s application for judicial review.\n[9] In its reply, the Commission agreed that the present complaints should be adjourned pending a resolution of its application for judicial review of the Matson decision. It also proposed terms for keeping the Tribunal apprised of the status of the judicial review proceedings and re-assessing the adjournment.\n[10] On September 30, 2013, the Tribunal released its decision in Andrews, 2013 CHRT 31. Similar to the Matson decision, both complaints in Andrews were dismissed because the Tribunal found the Complainant was challenging the registration provisions of the Indian Act, as opposed to any \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, offered by the Respondent.\n[11] On the same day, the Tribunal wrote to the parties to see if there were any additional submissions on how they wished to proceed given the release of the Andrews decision.\n[12] The Complainants did not provide any additional submissions and both the Commission and Respondent reiterated their support for adjourning the present complaints pending the resolution of the application for judicial review of the Matson decision before the Federal Court. The Respondent noted that the Commission had also filed an application for judicial review of the decision in Andrews and it proposed consolidating that application with the one in Matson.\nIII. Law and Analysis [13] It is well established that this Tribunal is the master of its own procedure, and that it is within its discretion to adjourn its proceedings. In Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14, the Tribunal stated:\n[15] It is well established that administrative tribunals are the masters of their own proceedings. As such, they possess significant discretion in deciding requests for adjournments. This principle was discussed in some detail by the Supreme Court of Canada in Prassad v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1989] 1. S.C.R. 560. In this case, the appellant sought an adjournment of her immigration inquiry pending a decision on her application to the Minister to permit her to remain in Canada. The adjudicator refused the adjournment.\n[16] In dealing with her appeal, the Supreme Court stated that administrative tribunals, in the absence of specific statutory rules or regulations, are masters of and control their own proceedings. But when tribunals exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, they must comply with the rules of natural justice. [See also Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers' International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (Ont. C.A.), Pierre v. Manpower and Immigration, [1978] 2 F.C. 849, 851 (FC.T.D.)].\n[14] That said, the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice, as well as the regime of the CHRA. The CHRA requires the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into complaints when requested by the Commission and to give parties a full and ample opportunity to present their case and make representations (see ss. 49(2) and 50(1) of the CHRA). Section 2 of the CHRA also expresses an overriding public interest in the elimination of discriminatory practices. And, of particular significance, s. 48.9(1) of the CHRA provides for proceedings before the Tribunal to be conducted as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice allow.\n[15] In a recent decision I find applicable in this case, Marshall v. Cerescorp Company, 2011 CHRT 5, the Tribunal reasoned:\n[11] According to section 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as informally and, of particular relevance to this motion, as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. However, as master of its own procedure, the Tribunal may, nonetheless, adjourn its proceedings where appropriate in its discretion (See L\u00e9ger v. Canadian Railways (1999) C.H.R.D. No. 6 (CHRT), at para. 4; Baltruweit v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2004 CHRT 14 at para. 15). The Tribunal must exercise this discretion having regard to principles of natural justice (Baltruweit, at para. 17). Some examples of natural justice concerns to which the Tribunal could respond would include the unavailability of evidence, the need to adjourn to obtain counsel, or late disclosure by an opposite party. (emphasis added)\n[16] The complaints here resemble those that were at issue in the Matson and Andrews cases, insofar as they allege the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice when it applied the registration provisions of the Indian Act. If the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning from the Matson and Andrews decisions were to be applied to the complaints here, the result would presumably be the same: the complaints would be dismissed. Like the Complainants here, the Complainants in Matson and Andrews also alleged the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice when it applied the registration provisions of the Indian Act. As mentioned above, the Tribunal dismissed those complaints because it found they were challenging the registration provisions of the Indian Act, as opposed to any \u201cservice\u201d, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA, offered by the Respondent. The Tribunal found that attacks aimed at legislation, and nothing else, fall outside the scope of the CHRA.\n[17] In the present cases, the Commission argues the CHRA allows for complaints that directly challenge a government department\u2019s application of mandatory legislation. The Respondent contends that type of complaint falls outside the jurisdiction of CHRA. The Tribunal provided its views on the issue in Matson and Andrews. The issue has now been brought to the Federal Court on judicial review. Therefore, given the fact that the same question is currently before the Federal Court, hearing the complaints at this time would not provide a full answer to the issues they raise. In my view, in terms of efficiency and fairness, the parties and the Tribunal would benefit from further clarification of these issues by the Federal Court.\n[18] Dealing with a similar request for an adjournment pending judicial review, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in Bailie et al. v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, 2012 CHRT 6 [Bailie], is instructive :\n[22] In the instant motion, the \u201cadmonition\u201d to proceed as expeditiously as possible must be seen in the larger context. In cases such as the section 13 hate message ones (i.e., Abrams and Makow) and the Air Canada pilots cases (Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al., and Bailie et al.), short term delay can achieve long term gain, and a better final result. In other words, allowing one case with the same or substantially similar issues to run its course through the administrative justice\/judicial system is fairer and more just and \u201cexpeditious\u201d in the long run to the parties and future parties than holding a hearing in each case, followed by judicial review applications and appeals. It is also more just in terms of the public interest, with finite resources of the taxpayer-funded Tribunal and courts. I do agree with the Commission\u2019s submission that, \u201cIt is therefore only in the most exceptional circumstances that the hearing of complaints should be suspended.\u201d This is such a case; \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist here.\n[19] The Tribunal, in Bailie, added:\n[27] I have followed the reasoning and approach of Member Lustig in Abrams and Makow, supra, dealing with the section 13 hate messages cases before the Tribunal, as stated in para. 9 and 8 of those Decisions, respectively. I note that in the hate messages cases, there too were conflicting Tribunal Decisions on the constitutionality of section 13: see Lemire, supra and Schnell v. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2002 CanLII 1887. However, unlike Bailie et al., with the s. 13 cases, there was at least a Supreme Court of Canada Judgment from 1990, Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, 1990 3 S.C.R. 892 on the constitutionality of s. 13. Since the Tribunal in Makow and Abrams found that the interests of justice clearly favoured adjourning (notwithstanding the presence of a highly instructive Supreme Court of Canada authority), then the argument for adjourning in the present case is even stronger, given the absence of similar judicial direction.\n[20] In the present motion, the \u201cadmonition\u201d to proceed as expeditiously as possible must also be seen in the larger context; delaying the proceedings now, in anticipation of the Federal Court\u2019s decision, can avoid applications for judicial review later on and will provide guidance to the Tribunal on how to deal with these complaints. As in Bailie, the argument for adjourning these proceedings is also supported by the absence of a judicial direction on the issues raised by the present complaints.\n[21] The Tribunal has already taken this approach with another set of complaints that raise similar allegations regarding Veterans Affairs Canada\u2019s application of the Canadian Forces Members and Veterans Re\u00adestablishment and Compensation Act (Tribunal Files T1898\/12812 to T1901\/13112). On consent of all parties, those complaints have been adjourned pending the resolution of the Matson judicial review.\n[22] In this case, the Complainants do not consent to an adjournment. Given the time that has passed since they filed their complaints and their ages, it is understandable that they want to proceed with their cases and avoid additional delays. However, given the potential result of these complaints without any further clarification from the Federal Court, I am not convinced that proceeding now will avoid additional delays. In fact, it may create further delays in the long term.\n[23] I recognize that every case has its own particularities since we are dealing with unique individuals and with different facts and issues. I also recognize the significant role that elders play in our society and the importance of their right to be heard in exercising this role. I also carefully considered the impacts on the Complainants in adjourning their cases. However, I find those considerations are outweighed by the potential additional delays and complexities that would be created if the Tribunal were to proceed with these complaints without further clarification from the Federal Court.\n[24] The Respondent suggested a middle ground in which the cases would be adjourned until the Federal Court has ruled in Matson and potentially Andrews, if the cases are joined, after which the Tribunal could revisit the adjournment status. The Respondent added that it does not view the adjournment being applicable to all appeals (Federal Court of Appeal and Supreme Court) in the event that they would occur.\n[25] Having considered the various interests and needs of the parties and the Tribunal, I grant the request to adjourn these proceedings.\nIV. Ruling [26] For the reasons above, Tribunal files T1894\/12412, T1895\/12512 and T1896\/12612 are adjourned sine die with the following conditions:\n(1) The Commission shall keep the Tribunal apprised of the status of judicial review applications\/appeals in the Matson and Andrews matters, including any Reasons for Judgment;\n(2) The issue of any further adjournment\/abeyance can be revisited and dealt with after the Federal Court decision in the Matson and\/or Andrews judicial review application is rendered.\n(3) Any party or the Tribunal may request the holding of a Case Management Conference Call after the release of Reasons for Judgment in any of the judicial reviews\/appeals referred to in clause (1) in order to re-assess the adjournment\/abeyance status herein.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 13, 2013\n",

The Motion. 1\nII........... Respondents\u2019 Reply. 2\nIII......... Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s Arguments. 3\nIV......... Decision. 5\nV........... Conclusion. 8\nI. The Motion [1] On August 15, 2013, the complainant sought orders from the Tribunal in the referenced file, orders that are contained in the conclusion of the email sent by the complainant, and which read as follows:\nRequest for Orders\nI am, therefore, requesting the Tribunal order:\n1. The Commission provide me with a point format, bound, single sided copy of their disclosure within one week of the Tribunal issuing a decision on this motion and indicate to me how they will be delivering the disclosure to meet my service of documents accommodations that they are very familiar with.\n2. Ms. Zagorska return forthwith the Exhibit Book reputedly \u201cborrowed\u201d for the evening which she has persistently refused to return which I consider to be in contempt of the Tribunal members direction to provide the complainant with it on May 6, 2013 and the Members position that I would have it returned May 8, 2013.\nand provide such an order before August 31, 2013.\n[2] Subsequent to that first motion by the complainant, she amended her first motion dated August 21, 2013, in order to request the following orders:\nOrders Requested:\n1. Ms. Warsame\/CHRC immediately serve the CHRC full disclosure for T1701\/5611 and T1702\/5711 and any disclosure related to the request o the complainant that the AG, counsel for HRSDC and HRSDC be part of this complaint presently before the Commission but separate parties in the manner stipulated for service of documents on the complainant.\n2. CAS and PWGSC immediately return the Exhibit Book (in a manner that meets the complainants accommodation needs due to disability) served on the complainant on May 6, 2013 with a clear description of any changes in the Exhibit Book (including pages that have been removed or are now included that were not included on May 6, 2013) that were made subsequent to the complainant being served the Exhibit Book on May 6, 2013.\n[3] In particular, the orders sought by the complainant are of a strictly procedural nature and they affect the conduct of the proceeding already commenced in the complainant\u2019s file dated May 6 and 7, 2013.\n[4] In her arguments, the complainant contends that the orders are required in order to ensure the fairness of the proceeding currently underway and she maintains that these orders are required in light of the fact that the CHRC failed to disclose its evidence in a manner so as \u201cto meet the accommodations of the complainant or indeed at all\u201d.\nII. Respondents\u2019 Reply [5] In response to the complainant\u2019s amended motion, respondents PWGSC and CAS indicated to the Tribunal that in the first conclusion sought in the complainant\u2019s amended motion, she referred to a third party that was not a party to the proceeding, namely, HRSDC, and immediately the respondents argued that this portion of the conclusion of the complainant\u2019s orders could not be considered given the Tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction.\n[6] Furthermore, in their submissions, the respondents indicated that the orders sought by the complainant had already been the subject of a Tribunal decision dated July 30, 2013, which was sent to the complainant in a letter addressed to her and dated July 30, 2013, and which specifically addressed the issues raised in the complainant\u2019s amended motion.\n[7] In addition, the respondents noted that they had informed the Tribunal and the complainant beforehand of the possibility of a motion for dismissal once the complainant\u2019s motion was completed. Having done this, any order by the Tribunal that would force the respondents to submit their exhibit book to the complainant would be premature, given that there was a strong likelihood that they would not have to submit their evidence in the present proceeding.\n[8] Further to this, the respondents pointed out that it would result in an abuse of process by the complainant because the issues had already been decided in the Tribunal\u2019s letter dated July 30, 2013, and accordingly, they pleaded res judicata as these issues had already been determined by the Tribunal.\n[9] Consequently, they asked the Tribunal to dismiss the complainant\u2019s motion to amend.\nIII. Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s Arguments [10] In its prepared arguments in response to the complainant\u2019s motion to amend, dated August 26, 2013, the Canadian Human Rights Commission stated that it had, by means of its respondents, provided a paper copy (hard copy) of its evidence to the complainant. In addition, the Commission noted that prior to July 25, 2013, namely, for a period of about six months, the complainant had never raised any problem whatsoever with regard to its disclosure of evidence or demanded a paper copy of that evidence (see paragraph 6 of the Commission\u2019s arguments).\n[11] Furthermore, the Commission made a reference, in correspondence dated July 29, 2013, and addressed to the complainant, to the fact that since its evidence had already been disclosed to the respondents, it did not intend to provide a second paper copy.\n[12] The Commission also indicated that each of the exhibits in its disclosure is numbered with a production number that can easily be compared with the electronic copy provided to the complainant by the Commission.\n[13] In support of its arguments, the Commission also referred to the Tribunal\u2019s letter dated July 30, 2013, which is useful to cite in its entirety in order to gain a better understanding of the present decision:\nThe Tribunal acknowledges receipt of your emails dated July 25, 2013, 5:26 p.m. and 5:37 p.m. requesting that the Respondent\u2019s Exhibit Book be returned to you by Respondent Counsel.\nUpon review of the transcripts of the hearing, I can confirm that the Respondent\u2019s Exhibit Book was not entered into evidence. The Respondent is obligated to provide copies of their Exhibit Book to all parties at the hearing only once it is filed and entered as an exhibit. The Tribunal cannot order that evidence which will be relied upon during the hearing process be provided to any party in advance.\nPlease refer to Tribunal rule 9(4) which states:\n9(4) Except with the consent of the parties, a document in a book of documents does not become evidence until it is introduced at the hearing and accepted by the Panel.\nAlso, further to your email dated July 29, 2013 3 :34 p.m. requesting that the Tribunal order the Canadian Human Rights Commission to provide you with \u201creadable print size copy of the CD disclosure\u201d, the Tribunal asks that you provide the Commission with the specific document numbers that you wish to be enlarged. The Commission provided their disclosure to all parties on January 29, 2013 and no concerns were raised regarding the quality of the documents at that time. During the hearing, there were issues regarding the print quality of Document 15H of the Complainant\u2019s Exhibit Book, however, legible copies of that page were provided as confirmed at page 320 line 15 of the transcripts.\n[14] Further in its arguments, the Commission referred to the fact that the Tribunal in its letter of July 30, 2013, had directed the complainant \u201cto provide the Commission with the specific documents that (Mrs. Marsden) wishes to be enlarged\u201d.\n[15] The Commission indicated that the complainant simply ignored the Tribunal\u2019s directions and decided to file a motion in which she repeated the same demands with regard to evidence that had already been addressed by the Tribunal in its letter of July 30, 2013.\n[16] Moreover, the Commission formally denied that it had \u201cknowingly treated the Complainant in an adverse and differential manner due to disability\u201d.\n[17] Ultimately, the Commission indicated that the complainant could always comply with the letter of July 30, 2013 sent to her by the Tribunal in order to specify which of the documents already disclosed by the Commission she needed to have enlarged. Thus, the Commission could produce new copies of the specific documents in question.\nIV. Decision [18] The Tribunal has carefully considered the submissions before it, both by the complainant and the respondents, as well as by the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[19] After having examined the merits of the case, and taking into account the conclusions of the complainant\u2019s motion to amend, the Tribunal maintains its decision dated July 30, 2013, with respect to the orders sought by the complainant.\n[20] Regarding the first order sought by the complainant, the Tribunal refers to the decision dated July 30, 2013, which clearly indicated the process to be followed in order to obtain any clarification with regard to documents that did not appear to be up to standard in the disclosure of evidence to the complainant.\n[21] The Tribunal notes here that the complainant in no way followed this process, preferring to file a motion to amend and thus seek a formal decision by the Tribunal.\n[22] However, it appears that up until the moment of this decision, the complainant had been able to obtain documents submitted by the respondents and by the Canadian Human Rights Commission that met the requirements that had been acceptable to her in the past, but taking into account certain specific instructions as to how the documents should be sent to her.\n[23] The Tribunal is of the view that all parties to this proceeding have shown good faith and that they have even been able to find the necessary compromises in order to provide the complainant with all of the documentation and proceedings requested, in light of her disabilities.\n[24] Therefore, the Tribunal finds that no more precise order in this matter would serve the interests of justice, given that the possibility still remains that the present order might be null and void for all sorts of reasons that are beyond the Tribunal\u2019s control and personal to the complainant and that new instructions may be issued by the complainant to the respondents or to the Commission in the future with regard to the serving of proceedings on the complainant.\n[25] Consequently, the Tribunal requests that the complainant provide, clearly and unequivocally, any instructions she finds useful and relevant in order for the other parties to this proceeding to serve proceedings on her. The Tribunal remains convinced that the other parties in this matter will agree to all potential accommodations that would meet the requirements of the complainant, thus avoiding the need for a formal order by the Tribunal.\n[26] With regard to the first conclusion sought in the complainant\u2019s motion to amend, the Tribunal adopts the respondents\u2019 comments to the effect that HRSDC is not a party to the present proceeding and as a consequence, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction with respect to this third party.\n[27] In light of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal therefore dismisses the first order sought by the complainant.\n[28] As for the second order in the complainant\u2019s motion to amend, which seeks from the Tribunal an order to return the exhibit book (of the respondents) that had been provided to her at the hearing on May 6, 2013, the Tribunal notes that the exhibit book was not introduced into evidence, which means that, pursuant to Rule 9(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure: \u201cExcept with the consent of the parties, a document does not become evidence until it is introduced at the hearing and accepted by the Panel.\u201d\n[29] Even though the complainant received from the respondents the said exhibit book at the hearing, at the Tribunal\u2019s suggestion, for the purposes of courtesy and a better understanding of the evidence, the Tribunal notes that nowhere in the transcript of the hearings of May 6 and 7, 2013 does it indicate that the said book was introduced into evidence by the respondents. At most, the complainant\u2019s book was duly introduced into evidence, which is consistent with the fact that the complainant began this proceeding by introducing her own exhibit book into evidence.\n[30] Given that the complainant had surely not finished her disclosure May 7, 2013 and that the respondents had not yet begun their disclosure, no exhibit book had been duly and legally introduced into evidence at the beginning of the hearing of this matter May 6 and 7, 2013 by the respondents.\n[31] Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that the letter of July 30, 2013 sent to the complainant, which decided the same issues that were raised in the complainant\u2019s motion to amend, shows that these issues had already been determined by the Tribunal in accordance with the rules of practice and procedure of the Tribunal, the fact of which was noted in the letter of July 30, 2013\n[32] Forcing the respondents to hand over their own exhibit book to the complainant, as she demands in her amended motion, would be an abuse of process in the eyes of the Tribunal and would be contrary to Rule 9(4) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\n[33] In addition, the Tribunal notes that the complainant has already obtained a paper copy of the disclosure of evidence she is once again seeking from the respondents.\n[34] The Tribunal finds that the complainant has obtained both an electronic and paper copy of the said evidence and that if some of the exhibits from this evidence turned out to have been unreadable, the Tribunal had indicated to the complainant in its letter of July 30, 2013, that she could inform the other parties which documents she would need new copies of in order to gain a better understanding of the said documents.\n[35] The Tribunal notes that the complainant did not comply with this simple and practical requirement that would have resolved the issues that confronted the complainant.\n[36] Finally, the Tribunal notes the offer by the Canadian Human Rights Commission, at paragraph 22 of its memorandum:\nThere is nothing in document numbers CHRC 185\/1 and CHRC 222\/19 which suggests that the Commission committed to provide a bound print copy of its disclosure. The Commission complied with its disclosure\u2019s obligation and provided its disclosure on a CD format as usual. At no time before her July 2013 emails, the Complainant raised concerns regarding the Commission\u2019s disclosure nor requested a print copy of the disclosure. That being said, in the event that Mrs. Marsden needs another copy of a specific document in the Commission\u2019s disclosure and provides the Commission with the description of the document as previously directed by the Tribunal, we will provide her with another copy of the said document.\nV. Conclusion [37] In light of the aforementioned reasons in this decision, the Tribunal therefore dismisses the complainant\u2019s amended motion dated August 21, 2013.\n[38] The Tribunal takes note of the following offer made by the Canadian Human Rights Commission:\nThat being said, in the event that Mrs. Marsden needs another copy of a specific document in the Commission\u2019s disclosure and provides the Commission with the description of the document as previously directed by the Tribunal, we will provide her with another copy of the said document.\nSigned by\nRobert Malo\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 25 2013\n",

Ruling. 5\nI. Complaint [1] In 2008, the Complainant says two young members of its community with Down syndrome required special education supports not available in their on-reserve school. As a result, they were sent to an off-reserve provincial school. According to the Complainant, while the federal government provided some funds for bussing and regular provincial tuition, it refused to help pay for the $80,000 required for special education supports.\n[2] The Complainant claims the Respondent\u2019s refusal to fund its two members\u2019 special education amounts to a discriminatory practice, on the basis of race and disability, pursuant to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. More broadly, the Complainant asserts flaws in the federal government\u2019s First Nations Special Education Program result in systemic discrimination against First Nations parents and children. That is, First Nations children living on reserve do not receive the same quality of special education supports as their non-First Nations counterparts living off-reserve.\nII. Motion [3] In preparing for a hearing in this matter, the Complainant says the Respondent has not adequately responded to its and the Commission\u2019s requests for the disclosure of documents.\n[4] Particularly, in a letter to the Respondent dated August 1, 2013, the Complainant reiterated a request it made on December 21, 2012 for the disclosure of additional documents. The Complainant says the Respondent, in correspondence dated January 23, 2013, indicated that it would provide these documents; however, it has not done so. Based on its review of the materials already provided by the Respondent, the Complainant provided a chart outlining the documents it believes still remain outstanding.\n[5] The August 1, 2013 letter also requests materials to explain how the federal government establishes the yearly overall national and Ontario budgets for Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development\u2019s (\u201cAANDC\u201d) First Nations Special Education Program. The Complainant lists the documents that it believes likely exist, but have not been disclosed.\n[6] Finally, after reviewing the Respondent\u2019s disclosure to date, the Complainant\u2019s August 1, 2013 letter also requests further documentation with respect to some of the materials already provided, including: legible versions of some documents; missing pages from certain documents; explanations for acronyms appearing in some documents; non-redacted copies of certain documents; explanation for duplicate copies of some documents; documentation to explain the origin or context of certain documents; documents referred to in documents already provided, but which have not been disclosed; and, details regarding the Respondent\u2019s search parameters for finding relevant documents.\n[7] The Commission also sent a letter to the Respondent, dated August 9, 2013, supporting the Complainant\u2019s request for additional documentation as outlined in the August 1, 2013 letter. The Commission\u2019s letter also requests additional disclosure from the Respondent. Based on its review of the materials provided by the Respondent to date, the Commission\u2019s letter provides a detailed list of the additional documents it requests.\n[8] The Complainant says the Respondent has not responded to its August 1, 2013 letter or the Commission\u2019s August 9, 2013 letter. Therefore, it has brought the present motion for further and better disclosure from the Respondent.\n[9] As part of its motion, the Complainant also asks that the Respondent to indicate: (i) which of the additional requested documents can and cannot be located; (ii) which of the requests in the Complainant\u2019s August 1, 2013 letter and the Commission\u2019s August 9, 2013 letter each of the additional documents are intended to respond to; and, (iii) for those materials that cannot be located, a description of the search conducted by the Respondent.\nIII. Response [10] In response to the Complainant\u2019s motion, the Respondent indicates that it is committed to ensuring that there is a complete evidentiary record in this matter. In this regard, the Respondent is prepared to provide the disclosure requested by both the Complainant and the Commission. It anticipates being able to disclose most of the materials requested by mid-January 2014.\n[11] For the documentation relating to the yearly overall national budget for the First Nations Special Education Program, while the Respondent does not oppose this request, it says it may take some time to produce these materials. According to the Respondent, it is estimated that a significant number of documents (electronic, paper and emails) will be captured by this request and will need to be reviewed, which will require a considerable amount of time and resources. It proposes April 30, 2014 as a deadline for the production of these documents.\n[12] The Respondent adds that the Complainant and Commission have both requested the production of Treasury Board submissions and decisions. According to the Respondent, these documents are subject to Cabinet Confidence and cannot be disclosed or produced. Six such documents have been identified and have been forwarded to the Privy Council Office for a certificate pursuant to section 39 of the Canadian Evidence Act.\n[13] As the Respondent is prepared to provide the disclosure requested in the Complainant\u2019s motion, its position is that it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to issue an Order in this matter.\nIV. Reply [14] Both the Complainant and the Commission say that, despite the Respondent\u2019s willingness to provide the documents requested in the motion, a formal Order is still required in this case.\n[15] The Complainant reiterates that the vast majority of the materials that are the subject of this motion were requested from the Respondent previously. Despite committing to provide those materials on January 23, 2013, the Respondent still has not done so. In the Complainant\u2019s view, a commitment by the Respondent to provide materials has clearly not proven sufficient.\n[16] The Commission submits that, as there have already been a number of requests and a series of productions over the past year, making a formal order will have the advantage of providing clarity as to (i) what exactly is to be produced; and, (ii) by what date.\n[17] Both the Complainant and Commission also point out that the motion not only asks the Respondent to produce the requested documents, but also provide an explanation of how any materials produced satisfy the requests made. In their view, the Respondent\u2019s submissions provide no assurances that any such explanation will be provided. According to the Complainant, this information is necessary for the Tribunal, the Complainant, and the Commission to: (a) understand which materials the Respondent cannot locate, as opposed to those materials it refuses to provide (e.g. for privilege); (b) understand how the Respondent has complied with the production order; (c) verify compliance with the production order; and, (d) assess whether an adequate search for materials has been conducted.\n[18] On the Respondent\u2019s proposal to provide documentation relating to the yearly overall national budget for the First Nations Special Education Program by April 30, 2014, neither the Complainant nor the Commission believe this deadline is reasonable. In their view, there has already been too much delay in these proceedings due to disclosure issues. With regard to the latest request for documents, the Respondent has been aware of it since at least the August 1 and 9, 2013 letters. Granting the Respondent until April 30, 2014 to produce these documents would mean that it will have had nearly nine months to respond to the request. Seeing as the complaint was filed in 2009, and involves alleged ongoing discrimination, the Complainant submits that further delay may lead to irreparable harm for some First Nations children and also threatens to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.\n[19] According to the Complainant, if sufficient resources are devoted to the task, granting the Respondent until the end of the year to comply with the request should be enough. However, in light of vacation schedules and other commitments, the Commission says it would likely be mid-to-late January before it could begin its review of the materials. Therefore, it would be satisfied with a direction that the requested documents be disclosed by January 31, 2014.\nV. Ruling [20] Pursuant to s. 48.9(1) of the Act, proceedings before the Tribunal are to be conducted as expeditiously as possible. Furthermore, under s. 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. This requires the disclosure of arguably relevant information between the parties.\n[21] Since the filling of Statements of Particulars in October and November 2012, over a year ago, the parties have been unable to proceed past the disclosure stage of these proceedings. This is because the Complainant and Commission have requested the disclosure of additional information from the Respondent, which they claim they have yet to receive. The Respondent does not dispute the relevance of the additional information, and has agreed to disclosure it. While the parties have attempted to work out these disclosure issues informally, this has not resulted in moving these proceedings forward expeditiously. Furthermore, the Complainant and Commission do not feel as though they can fully and amply present their case without the disclosure of this additional information. Therefore, I believe a direction from the Tribunal is necessary to ensure that these proceedings move forward expeditiously and fairly.\n[22] As it does not dispute the arguable relevance of the documents requested in the Complainant\u2019s August 1, 2013 letter and the Commission\u2019s August 9, 2013 letter, I direct the Respondent to disclose those documents pursuant to Rules 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). Taking into account the parties\u2019 submissions, I believe a reasonable deadline for complying with this direction is January 17, 2014 for all documents except those relating to the yearly overall national budget for the First Nations Special Education Program. The deadline to provide those latter documents will be March 7, 2014.\n[23] In responding to the Tribunal\u2019s direction to disclose the additional materials, the Complainant and Commission also ask the Respondent to indicate: (i) which of the additional requested documents can and cannot be located; (ii) which of the requests in the Complainant\u2019s August 1, 2013 letter and the Commission\u2019s August 9, 2013 letter each of the additional documents are intended to respond to; and, (iii) for those materials that cannot be located, a description of the search conducted by the Respondent. This is a reasonable request considering the large amount of additional documentation to be disclosed. Proceeding in this manner will also provide an assurance that the disclosure and production of any additional documentation is sufficient to allow the Complainant and the Commission the full and ample opportunity to be heard.\n[24] The Tribunal took a similar approach in Grand Chief Stan Louttit et al. v. AGC, 2013 CHRT 27 [Louttit]. In order to avoid the situation the Tribunal had to address in Louttit, and in order to avoid any further delay in these proceedings due to disclosure issues, I direct the Respondent to provide an explanation of how it has responded to the Complainant and Commission\u2019s disclosure requests.\n[25] Therefore, the Tribunal rules and directs as follows:\n1.

Decision. 19\nI. Background [1] On January 20, 2010, Mr. Geevarughese Johnson Itty, also known as Mr. Johnson Itty, (\u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) against the Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d), alleging discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin and age, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d).\n[2] On April 24, 2012, by letter (\u201cReferral Letter\u201d), the Commission asked the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the Complaint, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act, attaching a copy of the Complaint.\n[3] The Commission has advised that unless circumstances arise which cause it to change its position; it will not participate in the hearing.\n[4] On January 31, 2013, the Complainant filed his Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d). In addition to particulars of the allegations of discrimination against him by the Respondent contrary to section 7 of the Act, the Complainant alleges systemic discrimination contrary to section 10 of the Act. His SOP also states he anticipates filing a motion to amend the Complaint so as to include section 10.\n[5] On March 8, 2013, the Respondent filed its SOP. The Respondent objects to the Complainant\u2019s inclusion of his section 10 allegations. However, the Respondent\u2019s SOP contains responses and a defence to those section 10 allegations.\n[6] The Complainant did not and will not be filing a Reply to the Respondent\u2019s SOP.\n[7] On April 11, 2013, the parties by their counsel, and I, absent Commission counsel, had a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d), during which the Complainant stated he would be making a motion to amend the Complaint in order to include section 10 (\u201cMotion to Amend\u201d).\n[8] Respondent\u2019s counsel advised that he would be making a motion for an order for the confidentiality of parts of the Respondent\u2019s evidence (\u201cConfidentiality Motion\u201d). The Ruling on that Motion will be issued separately.\n[9] The parties submitted their motion materials in writing. There was no oral hearing.\nII. The Complaint [10] The Complaint alleges that the Respondent\u2019s Port of Entry Recruitment Training program (\u201cPOERT\u201d) discriminated against him on account of his age, national or ethnic origin and race, contrary to section 7 of the Act. Below is a summary of the Complaint.\n[11] The Complainant, a naturalized Canadian citizen, applied to the Respondent to become a Border Services Officer (\u201cBSO\u201d). He passed the Respondent\u2019s initial screening, and was invited into the nine-week POERT program, which contains two evaluation stages, called Determination Points: Determination Point I (\u201cD-I\u201d) and Determination Point II (\u201cD-II\u201d). The Complainant passed all the behavioural and written tests in D-I, and went on to POERT\u2019s second component, at the end of which was D-II. The latter Determination Point consists of another set of written tests and behavioural evaluations, including evaluations of simulations in which ten competencies (\u201cCompetencies\u201d) are assessed.\n[12] A trainee must obtain a \u201cmet\u201d (pass) on all the tests and behavioural evaluations in D-I and D-II, including the competencies, to become a BSO. The Complainant did not pass three of the D-II competencies, leading to a \u201cnot met\u201d grade, and was eliminated from the pool of potential BSOs.\n[13] The Complaint alleges that during the D-II training and evaluations, the following gave rise to the above grounds of discrimination and adverse differential treatment against the Complainant, which resulted in the denial of the employment opportunity to become a BSO:\n1) Two of the three assessors who evaluated his D-II competencies failed him on at least three competencies; they did not explain their observations and the reasons they failed him; this was improper given that the evaluation of these competencies is subjective and therefore vulnerable to individual prejudice, which these two assessors displayed; the Complainant noted that all three assessors were white;\n2) the Complainant was held to a higher standard than his white, younger classmates, none of whom were the same race or had the same national or ethnic origins as the Complainant, but who were passed notwithstanding that some of them made serious errors;\n3) the Complainant believes that the Respondent wanted to fail him because of his age and alleges that two other \u201colder gentlemen over 50 years of age were also failed\u2026\u201d;\n4) one of the assessors who failed him held a rank lower than Superintendent and was inexperienced, which inexperience detrimentally affected the Complainant\u2019s assessment; the fact that this lower-ranking individual assessed him rather than someone of at least Superintendent rank was contrary to what the Respondent\u2019s representatives had told the Complainant during the initial screening;\n5) he was told to change his seat at least twice during the classroom sessions, 2 weeks before D-II simulation testing; no one else had to change their seat more than once; this also made him nervous and insecure;\n6) on a number of occasions, the classroom instructor did not respond to the Complainant\u2019s questions or requests for clarification on training topics and he had to ask several times before the instructor answered him; the Complainant also found this insulting;\n7) he did not receive the requisite number of compensated visits home, contrary to Treasury Board guidelines;\n8) during his feedback session at the end of POERT, the feedback leader stopped the Complainant from taking notes when the assessors were telling him why he had not passed; when he attempted to ask questions and obtain clarifications of the reasons he had not passed, the feedback leader again treated him unfairly by yelling at him in front of everyone present.\nIII. Complainant\u2019s Motion to Amend [14] The Motion to Amend seeks to add the allegation that the Respondent\u2019s POERT program discriminated against the Complainant, on the same grounds as the section 7 allegations, but also contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[15] Section 10 of the Act states:\n\u201cIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment,\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\u201d\nIV. Issue [16] The issue in this Motion is whether or not the Tribunal should grant the Complainant\u2019s Motion to Amend the Complaint by adding the allegation of discrimination contrary to section 10 of the Act.\nV. Law on Amending Complaints Generally\n[17] The Tribunal has the authority to grant amendments in order to determine \u201c\u2026the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d, if granting the amendments would \u201c\u2026serve the interests of justice\u201d (Canderel Ltd. v. Canada (1994) 1 FC 3 (FCA) (\u201cCanderel\u201d), cited in Attorney General of Canada v. Alain Parent and The Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2006 FC 1313 at para. 30 (\u201cParent\u201d); in Stacey Lee Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation 1013 CHRT 9 (\u201cTabor\u201d) at para. 4.\n[18] In deciding whether or not to grant an amendment, \u201c\u2026the Tribunal does not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the proposed amendment\u201d (Tabor, supra, at para. 4).\nConnection between Complaint and Proposed Amendment [19] An amendment cannot so alter a complaint that it results in a substantially new complaint, therefore bypassing the referral process mandated by the Act (Tabor, supra, at para. 5, citing Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 (\u201cGaucher\u201d). Generally, \u201c\u2026issues arising out of the same set of factual circumstances should normally be heard together\u201d (Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII45929, CHRT, at para. 17 (\u201cCook v. Onion Lake\u201d), cited in Parent (supra) at para. 33.\n[20] Put another way, there must be a connection, in fact and in law, between the complaint and the amendment sought.\nPrejudice [21] However, the Tribunal cannot grant an amendment if there is \u201cactual prejudice\u201d to the other party, which is \u201creal and significant\u201d(\u201cCook v. Onion Lake\u201d, supra), cited in Museum of Civilization Corp. v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, Local 70396 (2006) F.C. 704, para. 28 (\u201cMuseum of Civilization\u201d). The party pleading prejudice must show prejudice which is of \u201csufficient magnitude to impact on the fairness of the hearing\u201d, Cook v. Onion Lake, supra, at para. 20.\n(a) The Complainant\u2019s Position Connection between Complaint and Proposed Amendment [22] In Museum of Civilization, supra, para. 52, the Federal Court adopted two paragraphs in Gaucher, supra, which essentially stated:\na) it is inevitable that new facts and circumstances come to light during an investigation;\nb) therefore, complaints are open to refinement;\nc) as long as the substance of the original complaint is respected, a complainant should be permitted to clarify and elaborate on the initial allegations before the complaint goes to a hearing;\nd) the Act is remedial and human rights tribunals have accordingly adopted a liberal approach to amendments, rather than a narrow or technical interpretation;\ne) in Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, the Supreme Court approved of an amendment to a complaint that \u201csimply brought the complaint into conformity with the proceedings\u201d, and an amendment of the kind proposed in Gaucher is merely a matter of ensuring that the form of the complaint accurately reflects the substance of the allegations the Commission referred to the Tribunal.\n[23] The proposed amendment is within the subject matter and substance of the original Complaint because the same facts that support the Complainant\u2019s section 7 allegations also support his section 10 allegations. The proposed amendment merely brings the Complaint into conformity with the facts already alleged.\n[24] The allegations of systemic discrimination (contrary to section 10), flow from the Complainant\u2019s allegations of discrimination in employment and adverse differential treatment.\n[25] By having investigated and considered the facts in the Complaint which support section 7, the Commission also investigated and considered the facts to support the addition of section 10 to the Complaint, because they are the same. The Commission referred the entire Complaint to the Tribunal, and the Complaint also encompasses the section 10 facts. Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to grant the amendment.\n[26] The Complaint contains the following factual allegations in support of section 10 systemic discrimination:\na) the Complainant and two older men in their 50\u2019s failed POERT;\nb) an officer ranking lower than Superintendent evaluated the Complainant, contrary to the procedure the Respondent told the Complainant would be used;\nc) the competencies\u2019 evaluations are subjective, therefore vulnerable to the individual prejudices of evaluators, as occurred with the Complainant;\nd) the adverse differential treatment the Complainant experienced during POERT was indicative of larger discriminatory practices during his evaluations;\ne) the Respondent applied an unreasonable threshold to the Complainant (i.e., a higher standard) in assessing his competencies.\n[27] The Commission\u2019s April 24, 2012 letter to the Complainant (\u201cCommission Letter\u201d), (described by the Complainant as the referral letter to the Tribunal) contained a statement that \u201c\u2026the evidence suggests\u2026the complainant did not pass the standardized testing [in] the training program because of his race, national or ethnic origin and\/or age\u201d. The Commission Letter\u2019s reference to \u201cstandardized\u201d tests raises section 10 grounds.\n(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position Connection between Complaint and Proposed Amendment [28] The proposed amendment alleges a new legal ground containing new allegations of systemic discrimination, and opens up a new and unanticipated route of inquiry which substantially amounts to a new complaint, not contemplated in the original Complaint and which takes it far beyond its original scope and factual content.\n[29] It raises the same issue as described by the Federal Court in Museum of Civilization, supra, at para. 30, in that it would alter the allegations in the Complaint \u201c\u2026to such a degree that it amounts to a new subject of inquiry which takes the complaint outside the scope\u2026\u201d of the Commission\u2019s referral.\n[30] There is a distinction between a complaint of personal discrimination contrary to section 7, and one that a practice or policy is itself discriminatory, contrary to section 10. That distinction makes them separate complaints. Given this distinction, the proposed section 10 amendment constitutes a new complaint. The Tribunal followed this distinction in Cook v. Onion Lake, supra. The question of whether the program in question was \u201c\u2026inherently discriminatory is a separate issue. It was never part of the original complaint\u201d (ibid, supra, at para. 24).\n[31] Therefore, the proposed amendment does not flow from the substance and facts of the existing Complaint, nor does it merely bring the Complaint into conformity with facts already alleged.\n[32] The Tribunal is without jurisdiction to grant the amendment. First, subsection 44(3) and section 49 of the Act have the effect of conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal only if the Commission refers a complaint to the Tribunal. To permit the amendment in the within circumstances would circumvent the Act\u2019s prerequisites for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction. The Respondent also relies for this ground on Museum of Civilization, supra, at para. 28.\n[33] Secondly, the Complaint does not include section 10 allegations \u2013 it contains only allegations under section 7. Therefore, the Commission did not investigate the Complaint in terms of section 10, rather only in terms of section 7. The Commission did not consider or deal with section 10, and therefore could not have referred a section 10 allegation to the Tribunal. On this ground as well, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to add the amendment to the Complaint.\n[34] In fact, the Commission\u2019s Investigative Report (\u201cIR\u201d) was specifically framed in terms of section 7 (IR, December 5, 2011, para. 1, as cited in Respondent\u2019s Response to Motion). It follows that in referring the Complaint to the Tribunal, the Commission\u2019s Referral Letter did not include section 10 and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to permit the amendment.\n[35] The facts in the Complaint which the Complainant states support the addition of section 10 allegations in reality do not do so. The Complainant interprets particular phrases and sentences in the Complaint out of context. The Complaint only alleges instances of discrimination personal to him, and not systemic discrimination in the POERT program itself.\n[36] Further, neither the Complaint nor Complainant\u2019s SOP clearly states which policies or practices he alleges as discriminatory contrary to section 10.\n[37] To interpret the phrase \u201cstandardized testing\u201d in the Commission Letter as encompassing an amendment to add section 10 to the referred Complaint is to impute a meaning to the phrase that is not warranted by the Complaint itself or the Commission investigation.\n(c) Analysis [38] The Complainant states that he relies on all the factual allegations under section 7 to also support his section 10 allegations. I have reviewed the Complainant\u2019s SOP. The only change in its factual allegations compared to those in the Complaint is the addition of an incident of alleged differential treatment during the CDT simulation in the D-II component (\u201cthe CDT simulation\u201d). Therefore, the requisite factual connection between the Complaint and the amendment is present. The requested amendment cannot correctly be characterized as a new and separate complaint.\n[39] In Cook v. Onion Lake, supra, the Commission motioned to add alcoholism as another ground of discrimination under the disability ground. The Tribunal denied the amendment on the basis that it amounted to a new complaint. This reason, however, was coupled with the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the amendment raised \u201cdeep issues\u201d for the Respondent, who would suffer prejudice if the amendment was granted.\n[40] The Complainant alleges discrimination in the Respondent\u2019s assessment of his suitability for a job. The tests and practices used in those assessments would themselves have to be canvassed in evidence in order to both provide a full picture of the matters in issue and also determine \u201c\u2026the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d (Canderel, supra, cited in Parent, supra and Tabor, supra). The tests and evaluation processes themselves represent a substantive connection to the Complaint and flow from the allegations under section 7.\n[41] I have concluded that the requested amendment does not constitute a separate, new complaint. I have found that the proposed amendment and the Complaint have factual and substantive connections. When the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal, that referral included all the circumstances of the Complaint, including section 10 systemic discrimination. Therefore, the Tribunal is not bypassing the Act\u2019s referral processes, and the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to grant the amendment.\n[42] The Complainant included the Commission\u2019s Investigative Report (\u201cIR\u201d) in its motion materials and argument. I note that the IR recommended that the Commission dismiss the Complaint. After receiving the parties\u2019 responses to the IR, the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry.\n[43] Given that circumstance, the IR can be given little weight.\n[44] The question of whether the Complainant\u2019s materials and evidence establish section 10 allegations will be decided after the hearing.\n[45] Regarding whether or not the Complainant\u2019s materials notify the Respondent as to which policies and practices he alleges violate section 10, I note the following:\na) the Complaint alleges the Respondent wanted to fail him because of his age and that the Respondent also failed two other \u201colder gentleman over 50\u201d;\nb) the Complaint notes that Complainant\u2019s three competencies assessors were white;\nc) in paragraph 33 of his SOP, the Complainant characterizes the simulation evaluations of the competencies as \u201c\u2026more subjective and vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination\u201d [than the other tests in POERT];\nd) in paragraph 34 of his SOP, the Complainant alleges that many of those from other classes who failed POERT were also middle-aged;\ne) the Complaint states that the competencies evaluations are subjective and therefore vulnerable to the assessors\u2019 individual prejudices;\nf) paragraph 52 of Complainant\u2019s SOP alleges in effect that the practice of using an officer of lesser rank than Superintendent as an assessor adversely affected his evaluation;\ng) paragraph 54 again characterizes the competencies, including those he failed, as \u201chighly subjective\u201d, which \u201cadversely impacted the Complainant\u2019s performance\u201d because his \u201c\u2026race, national or ethnic origin, and age played a significant factor in his evaluations\u201d; as such, POERT is \u201cdiscriminatory, contrary to section 10\u2026\u201d;\nh) paragraph 55 alleges Respondent\u2019s application of the competencies discriminated contrary to sections 7 and 10 because \u201c\u2026it relied on aspects of his race, colour [sic], national or ethnic origin and age when it failed him\u201d;\ni) paragraph 57 asserts the Respondent used a higher standard to evaluate the Complainant\u2019s competencies than that it used for his classmates, none of whom shared his racial, national or ethnic origin or age attributes; he alleges that the fact the other candidates made mistakes and passed, while he failed, evidences discrimination contrary to sections 7 and 10.\n[46] The above allegations serve to both set out and notify the Respondent of the policies and practices which the Complainant alleges are contrary to section 10 of the Act.\n[47] The Commission Letter is not relevant in ascertaining the scope of the Complaint. The Commission Letter was a communication between the Commission and the Complainant, not the Commission and the Tribunal. It is not the Referral Letter the Commission sent to the Tribunal to initiate the inquiry.\n[48] The referral letter, with the complaint attached, is what the Tribunal sees and acts upon \u2013 it sets the Tribunal inquiry in motion. The specific Referral Letter in this case asked the Tribunal to make an inquiry into the Complaint because \u201c\u2026having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted\u201d. The phrase \u201c\u2026having regard to all the circumstances\u2026\u201d is broad and general, and is to be interpreted broadly and generally. That phrase mandates the Tribunal to enquire into all relevant aspects of a complaint.\nPrejudice (a) The Complainant\u2019s Position [49] The Complainant submits that the proposed amendment will not cause any prejudice to the Respondent because it merely brings the Complaint into conformity with the facts already alleged. It does not raise a new complaint because it does not allege new facts. It does not open up \u201c\u2026a new and unanticipated route of inquiry\u201d (Gaucher, supra, para. 18).\n[50] Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s allegation of delay, the Complainant has in fact sought the amendment very early in the process \u2013 his SOP, filed January 31, 2013, set out his section 10 allegations and his intention to seek the amendment. Further, the Tribunal has not set any hearing dates. The Respondent has therefore had notice of the proposed amendment since January 31, 2013, and has had notice of and known about the facts on which the Complainant relies for the amendment since the Complaint was filed. The Respondent will have ample time to prepare for the hearing of the amended Complaint. It follows that this is not a case where permitting the amendment would impair the Respondent\u2019s right to natural justice by taking away its right to procedural fairness and a fair hearing.\n(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position [51] The Respondent submits that the proposed amendment would prejudice the Respondent for the reasons below.\n[52] The proposed amendment would alter the Complaint to such a degree that it would open up a \u201cnew and unanticipated route of inquiry\u201d, introducing a \u201csubstantially new complaint\u201d.\n[53] The Complainant\u2019s delay in raising systemic discrimination has already prejudiced the Respondent at the Commission level because the Respondent could not avail itself of the Commission\u2019s scrutiny with respect to section 10.\n[54] The Respondent would be severely prejudiced if the Tribunal grants the amendment because it would take away the Respondent\u2019s opportunity to have defended itself at the Commission level. The Complaint and the investigation were framed solely in terms of section 7, not section 10. All of the Respondent\u2019s responses to the Commission process, including to the investigation, were geared to section 7. The Respondent submits that it did not have access to any of the Commission\u2019s processes with respect to section 10, including investigation, conciliation and mediation. This constitutes real and significant prejudice to the Respondent.\n[55] If the Tribunal permitted the amendment, it would result in a breach of the Respondent\u2019s procedural fairness rights, specifically, its right to be given a fair opportunity to defend itself at the Commission against the section 10 allegations. This is akin to what the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal decided in Dillman v. IMP Group Ltd., 1995 CanLII 4254 (NSCA) (\u201cDillman\u201d), where it overturned an amendment a Board of Inquiry had granted at the hearing stage.\n[56] The Respondent will be further prejudiced because it will have to produce a \u201cwealth\u201d of additional witnesses, expert reports, and statistical analyses in order to respond to the section 10 allegations, significantly delaying the hearing date. It would also lengthen the hearing itself, thereby further prejudicing the Respondent.\n[57] The proposed amendment would so prejudice the Respondent that it would negate its ability to have a fair hearing.\n(c) Analysis [58] I have found above that the proposed amendment to add section 10 systemic discrimination does not constitute a new and separate complaint.\n[59] A motion to amend a complaint to include section 10 discrimination three years from the date of filing a complaint is a long delay. However, that delay does not rise to the level of real and significant prejudice which would bar the amendment.\n[60] The Respondent has had notice of the Complainant\u2019s section 10 allegations since January 31, 2013, when the Complainant included them in his SOP. It has had notice of almost all of the facts and incidents on which the Complainant relies, except one, since the Complainant filed his Complaint. The delay in requesting the amendment does not prejudice the Respondent\u2019s right to a fair hearing at the Tribunal. If the Respondent requires more time to prepare for the hearing, including proffering additional documentary evidence and witnesses prior to the hearing, a reasonable request for more time will be considered favourably. Although inconvenient, this delay does not unfairly impact the Respondent\u2019s ability to prepare for the Tribunal hearing.\n[61] With respect to investigation, the Complainant\u2019s SOP, documentary evidence and Motion materials set out the allegations of fact on which he relies. In his SOP, he specifies the processes and practices he alleges constitute discrimination contrary to section 10. The Complainant has included one additional alleged incident which is not in the Complaint, the Control and Defensive Tactics Simulation Exercise (\u201cCDT simulation\u201d), during which the Complainant alleges discrimination by the Respondent. The Respondent can respond to this in an amended Statement of Particulars, by calling additional witnesses, or in whichever manner it chooses.\n[62] Mediation is also available at the Tribunal at any time the parties wish, up to the commencement of the hearing. As well, the parties are free to discuss private settlement at any time in the Tribunal process.\n[63] Although granting the amendment may delay the hearing date and may lengthen the duration of the hearing because the Respondent wishes to add other witnesses and provide further documentary evidence, the Complainant faces the same delay and lengthening of the hearing. I do not see this as constituting prejudice \u2013 rather, it is inconvenience.\n[64] I also take into account the factors set out below.\nThe Respondent\u2019s SOP [65] Paragraph 47 of the Respondent\u2019s SOP denies the Complainant\u2019s allegations under section 10. Paragraph 58 denies that the POERT competencies tests are subjective and took away the Complainant\u2019s employment opportunities or that they tend to deny employment opportunities to others with the Complainant\u2019s characteristics, contrary to section 10.\n[66] Paragraph 59 provides that if the Tribunal does find discrimination, the Respondent submits that requiring the Complainant to pass the D-II competencies, including the three competencies he failed, are bona fide occupational requirements (\u201cBFOR\u201d) of the BSO position and cannot be accommodated without undue hardship.\n[67] The above paragraphs in the Respondent\u2019s SOP respond to the Complainant\u2019s section 10 allegations, and also set up a BFOR justification defence pursuant to the Act.\n[68] Presently, the Respondent\u2019s Schedule \u201cA\u201d lists the following documents:\n1) no. 3, CBSA Workforce Analysis Report for Visible Minorities, dated March 2007 \u2013 April 1, 2012\n2) no. 6, Port of Entry Recruit Training Program Handbook, July, 2008;\n3) no. 7, Port of Entry Training Program Test Objectives Booklet, October 7, 2008;\n4) no. 37, CBSA-GTA Visible Minority Demographics, March 31, 2009 \u2013 April 1, 2012;\n5) no. 53, Statement of Merit Criteria, undated;\n6) no. 55, Port of Entry Training Program \u2013 An Overview, undated;\n7) no. 67, Training Process Summary, undated\nThe Respondent\u2019s Proposed Witnesses [69] I summarize below those Respondent witnesses to date and the portions of their anticipated evidence which appear relevant to this motion:\n1) in addition to the specifics of the Complainant\u2019s individual assessment process, witnesses (a), (b), and (c), the three assessors who evaluated the Complainant\u2019s D-II simulations, will give evidence as to \u201cthe objects and goals of D-II simulation assessments\u201d and their priorities in conducting assessments of simulations in general;\n2) witness (d)\u2019s evidence will address the general structure and process of the BSO recruitment process, including POERT; POERT\u2019s purpose and goals; and the training program for assessors;\n3) witness (f) will address scheduling and practices related to the CDT evaluation simulations;\n4) in addition to specifics regarding the Complainant, witness (g)\u2019s evidence will address the classroom practices in the POERT program;\n5) witness (h), director of the entity which developed simulations and assessment processes for POERT with the CBSA, will present expert evidence as an industrial psychologist to rebut any expert testimony regarding the simulation evaluations the Complainant may submit;\n6) witness (i), a CBSA Administrative Superintendent for the GTA region, will testify about scheduling and pay practices for BSOs in the GTA region;\n7) witness (j), an expert witness, will opine on CBSA employment.\n[70] Subject to the fact that I have not seen the actual Schedule \u201cA\u201d documents listed above, and will not see them until the hearing, the combination of the above portions of the Respondent\u2019s SOP and the portions of the anticipated evidence of the above witnesses speak to the Complainant\u2019s section 10 allegations because they seem to address, at least in part, general structure, process and practices of the Respondent\u2019s recruitment system. They indicate that the Respondent is in a position to mount a defence regarding the Complainant\u2019s section 10 allegations. This proposed evidence militates against the Respondent suffering prejudice if the Tribunal grants the proposed section 10 amendment.\n[71] In addition, if it wishes to do so, the Respondent can submit further documentary evidence or witnesses, giving the other parties proper notice (the Complainant can do the same in response). Hearing dates have not yet been set and the parties therefore have the time to do this as part of their preparation and ongoing disclosure.\n[72] The Respondent cites Cook v. Onion Lake (supra) in support of its position. Ms. Cook\u2019s original complaint was that by refusing to admit her to its Life Skills Programme because of her disability (Hepatitis C), the respondent discriminated against her contrary to section 5 of the Act. After the Commission referred her complaint to the Tribunal, the Commission requested the complaint be amended by adding that the respondent discriminated against Ms. Cook also because of the disability of alcoholism.\n[73] The Tribunal refused the amendment in part because it found the amendment constituted a new, separate complaint which the Commission could not have referred to the Tribunal and, therefore, the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to deal with it. The other basis for the Tribunal\u2019s refusal to grant the amendment was because, in the Tribunal\u2019s words, the Respondent would face \u201c\u2026deep issues\u201d, and \u201c\u2026any attack on this aspect of the programme undermines one of the fundamental policies [no alcohol or drugs on the reserve] on which the [respondent] reserve operates\u201d (ibid, supra, at para. 25). I interpret the foregoing statement as finding that the Onion Lake would suffer actual prejudice if the Tribunal granted the requested amendment.\n[74] The Respondent also cites Dillman, supra. The New Brunswick Court of Appeal disallowed an amendment which had not been introduced until the Board of Inquiry hearing, at which no one at all was present for the respondent. The Court held that the respondent could not have been deemed to have had notice of the amendment granted by the Board, and therefore suffered real prejudice on account of the amendment, which the Commission had never referred to the Board of Inquiry. In the present case, the Complainant has sought its amendment before any hearing date has been set and the Respondent has had notice of the proposed amendment, as noted above.\n[75] In considering the issue of prejudice, I have also taken into account potential prejudice to the Complainant if the Tribunal held that the requested amendment was a new, separate complaint. It would serve no purpose, both in terms of natural justice or judicial economy, to require the Complainant to start anew and file another complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination contrary to section 10 in the POERT program against the same Respondent and on the same facts. Both parties would have to go through the whole process again. Granting the amendment would avoid prejudice to the Complainant.\n[76] For all the reasons set out above, I find there is a connection in fact and in substance between the Complaint and the requested amendment; the Respondent will not be prejudiced if the amendment is granted; and granting the amendment will not impact the fairness of the hearing.\n[77] It should be noted that the granting of the amendment does not mean that the Complainant has established his case with respect to either section 10 or section 7. That can only be decided when the hearing is complete.\nVI. Decision [78] The Complaint is amended by deleting the words \u201ccontrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act\u201d in the last line of paragraph 1 of the Complaint and substituting for the deleted portion the phrase \u201ccontrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\u201d\n[79] The Tribunal will hold a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) as soon as possible on a date convenient to the parties to discuss scheduling of dates for the Respondent to file an amended Statement of Particulars, pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), if the Respondent wishes to do so in light of the amendment, and for the Complainant to file a Reply to the Amended Statement of Particulars, if he wishes to do so. The parties may also address any other matter they wish in the CMCC.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 16, 2013\n",

Item 13 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents. 6\nXII....... Order 7\nI. Background [1] On January 20, 2010, Mr. Geevarughese Johnson Itty, also known as Mr. Johnson Itty, (\u201cComplainant\u201d) filed a complaint (\u201cComplaint\u201d) with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) against the Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d or \u201cRespondent\u201d), alleging discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin and age, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cAct\u201d). The Complaint was subsequently amended to include section 10 allegations.\n[2] On April 24, 2012, by letter (\u201cReferral Letter\u201d), the Commission asked the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the Complaint, pursuant to section 44(3)(a) of the Act.\n[3] The Commission has advised that unless circumstances arise which cause it to change its position, it will not participate in the hearing.\n[4] On January 31, 2013, the Complainant filed his Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d). On March 8, 2013, the Respondent filed its SOP. The Complainant did not and will not be filing a Reply to the Respondent\u2019s SOP.\n[5] On April 11, 2013, the parties by their counsel, and I, absent Commission counsel, had a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d), during which Respondent\u2019s counsel advised that he would be making a motion for an order for the confidentiality of parts of the Respondent\u2019s evidence (\u201cConfidentiality Motion\u201d).\n[6] The parties submitted written motion materials. There was no oral hearing. The Commission did not participate in the Confidentiality Motion.\nII. The Complaint [7] The Complaint, as amended, alleges that the Respondent\u2019s Port of Entry Recruitment Training program (\u201cPOERT\u201d) discriminated against him on account of his age, national or ethnic origin and race, contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[8] The Complainant, a naturalized Canadian citizen, applied to the Respondent to become a Border Services Officer (\u201cBSO\u201d). He passed the Respondent\u2019s initial screening. He was invited as a trainee into the nine-week POERT program, which contains two evaluation stages, called Determination Points: Determination Point I (\u201cD-I\u201d), and Determination Point II (\u201cD-II\u201d). Trainees must pass the entire POERT program in order to be placed in the pool of those eligible to be hired as BSOs.\n[9] The Complainant passed all the behavioural and written tests in D-I, and went on to POERT\u2019s second component, at the end of which was D-II. The latter Determination Point consists of another set of written tests and behavioural evaluations, including evaluations of simulations in which ten competencies are assessed. The Complainant did not pass D-II and was not placed in the pool of potential BSOs.\n[10] It is not necessary for the purposes of this Motion to further detail the Complaint.\nIII. Respondent\u2019s Motion for Confidentiality and Other Motion Materials [11] The Complainant has asked for disclosure of POERT assessor manuals, his own and various classmates\u2019 POERT test results, and other documents which the Respondent submits require an order designating them as confidential, with conditions governing their release to the Complainant and the Tribunal.\n[12] The Respondent\u2019s Motion is for an Order that the thirteen documents listed in Schedule \u201cA\u201d of the Affidavit of Fernande Surprenant, Acting Executive Director of the Learning Design Solutions Division of the Respondent, sworn May 17, 2013 (\u201cSurprenant Affidavit\u201d) be designated as confidential and subject to certain conditions of disclosure. I do not specify the specific conditions in this paragraph because they have evolved as a result of the contents of in the Complainant\u2019s Response to Motion and the Respondent\u2019s Reply.\n[13] I also do not set out the parties\u2019 arguments in any detail because they have agreed on most aspects of this Motion and the resulting Order.\n[14] I refer to the thirteen documents listed in Schedule A of the Surprenant Affidavit as the \u201cSchedule \u201cA\u201d Documents\u201d and will refer to them individually using the same numbers as used in the Surprenant Affidavit.\n[15] The Respondent\u2019s Reply includes the Affidavit of Emily MacLeod, a legal assistant who works with Respondent counsel, affirmed June 13, 2013 (\u201cMacLeod Affidavit\u201d).\nIV. Issue [16] The issue in this Motion is whether or not the Tribunal should grant the Respondent\u2019s Confidentiality Motion.\nV. Law on Confidentiality in the Act [17] Section 52 of the Act states:\n\u201c(1) An inquiry shall be conducted in public, but the member or panel conducting the inquiry may, on application, take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that\na) there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed;\nb) there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\nc) there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; or\nd) there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\n(2) If the member or panel considers it appropriate, the member or panel may take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of a hearing held in respect of an application under subsection (1).\u201d\nVI. Other Applicable Legislation [18] The Respondent also relies on the Public Service Employment Act, SC 2003, c. 22, as well as the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (\u201cTribunal Rules\u201d), in particular Rules 3 and 6.\nVII. General Analysis [19] As set out in its Preamble, one of the purposes of the Public Service Employment Act, supra (\u201cPSEA\u201d). is to ensure that appointments to the federal public service are based on merit and are nonpartisan. Further, the PSEA\u2019s Preamble provides that the merit principle is a value that is very important to safeguard.\n[20] The Respondent uses written and simulation training manuals and testing materials in its POERT program. POERT assessors and instructors (the latter also called \u201cfacilitators\u201d) give a written promise to the Respondent not to reveal or discuss with anyone other than designated persons any POERT course content or testing materials including practice scenarios. This promise applies before, during and after the POERT program. The breaking of this promise of ongoing confidentiality has severe consequences.\n[21] The Respondent Agency and its BSOs have an extremely important role in facilitating and safeguarding the movement and security of Canadian citizens, residents, visitors and commercial traffic into and out of Canada\u2019s vast borders.\n[22] It is in the interests of Canada and those who live here that BSOs be properly trained, vetted and qualified for this significant work. The POERT program tries to accomplish this. Another rubric under which POERT functions is the requirement under the PSEA that public service appointments be based on merit and be nonpartisan, and further, that these values be safeguarded. In order to do so, the integrity of the POERT documents listed in the Schedule \u201cA\u201d documents must be safeguarded; otherwise, there is a real risk that POERT\u2019s testing materials and training and assessment scenarios could be disclosed, whether intentionally or inadvertently, and candidates without merit could pass them. This would compromise not only the merit principle and cause the Respondent undue hardship, but would also compromise the public\u2019s safety.\n[23] I am satisfied, in accordance with section 52 of the Act, that if the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents were made public during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security would be disclosed, and that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved, particularly the Respondent, such that the need to prevent disclosure other than under the conditions set out in the Order below outweighs the societal interest that these documents be fully disclosed to the public.\nVIII. Complainant\u2019s Position regarding Items 1 to 8 and 11 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents [24] In paragraphs 2 and 3 of the MacLeod Affidavit, the deponent avers, on information from Respondent\u2019s counsel, that the Complainant \u201cdoes not object\u201d to all the conditions of the Respondent\u2019s proposed Confidentiality Order in its Notice of Motion applying to items 1 to 8 and item 11 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents. Exhibit \u201cA\u201d of the MacLeod Affidavit consists of copies of two emails from the Complainant\u2019s representative to the Respondent\u2019s counsel setting out Complainant\u2019s position.\nIX. Respondent\u2019s Position regarding Item 9 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents [25] In paragraph 12 of its Reply, the Respondent states it does not require a confidentiality order for item 9 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents as the Complainant has obtained it pursuant to an Access to Information application.\nX. Items 10 and 12 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents [26] Items 10 and 12 are POERT scores for some of the Complainant\u2019s classmates. The Complainant states he needs to present them to those individuals, in order to fully present his case. Subject to certain conditions to ensure confidentiality, the Respondent agrees.\n[27] I find that the Respondent\u2019s conditions are reasonable limitations on disclosure, and balance the need to protect the confidentiality of these aspects of the POERT program while protecting the Complainant\u2019s right to fully present his case. The Order below reflects this accordingly.\nXI. Item 13 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents [28] The Complainant submits that he needs to provide this document to an expert witness, whose opinion is necessary in presenting his case. I have reviewed the Respondent\u2019s proposed conditions for the release of item 13 to the Complainant\u2019s expert. I conclude that these conditions are also reasonable limits on disclosure, and balance the need for confidentiality of the document with the Complainant\u2019s right to natural justice, including the right to fully present his case. The Order below deals with item 13 accordingly.\nXII. Order [29] This Order does not apply to item 9 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents.\n[30] All the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents, except item 9, are designated as confidential, in accordance with section 52 of the Act, and are also subject to the following terms:\n(a) they or any of them shall not be disclosed, directly or indirectly, during the course of this proceeding, without the Respondent\u2019s prior written consent, to anyone other than:\n(i) the Complainant and his representative; and\n(ii) the Tribunal.\n(b) When filed with the Tribunal, they or any of them shall not form part of the public record and shall be filed in a sealed envelope. The Tribunal shall not make the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents, or any parts thereof, available to the public.\n(c) The Complainant or his representative shall not use the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents for any purpose other than pursing the Complaint before the Tribunal.\n(d) The Complainant and his representative shall not make any copies of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents, including, without limitation, electronic copies.\n(e) The Complainant\u2019s representative is required to keep the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents under lock and key when not in use in this proceeding.\n(f) Within ten (10) days after the appeal rights relating to the Complaint have expired, the Complainant\u2019s representative, and the Complainant, if applicable, shall return the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents to the Respondent\u2019s counsel.\n[31] The parties shall comply with the following conditions with respect to items 10 and 12 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents:\n(a) the Complainant shall only disclose each of item 10 and 12 to the witness to whom the item pertains and to no other witness;\n(b) before the Complainant discloses item 10 and 12 or either of them to the witness to whom the item pertains, the Complainant shall obtain and provide to the Respondent the witness\u2019 written consent for the Respondent to disclose to the Complainant and his representative which documents pertain to the witness;\n(c) upon receipt of the witness\u2019 written consent, the Respondent will disclose to the Complainant which documents pertain to which witness;\n(d) the Complainant shall only permit the applicable witness to view the documents in question either at the office of the Complainant\u2019s representative or during the hearing before the Tribunal;\n(e) the Complainant and his representative, or either of them, shall not provide the witness with his or her own copy of the documents.\n[32] The parties shall comply with the following conditions with respect to item 13 of the Schedule \u201cA\u201d Documents:\n(a) Before the Respondent provides item 13 or a copy thereof to the Complainant and before the Complainant provides the copy of item 13 to his expert witness, the Complainant shall provide the Respondent with the name and qualifications of the Complainant\u2019s expert witness;\n(b) subparagraphs a) through f) of paragraph 2 of this Order shall apply mutatis mutandis to the Complainant\u2019s expert witness; and\n(c) before the Complainant gives item 13 to his expert witness, the Complainant or his representative shall furnish the expert witness with a copy of this Confidentiality Order and shall obtain from that expert witness a written dated acknowledgment that the expert witness has read the Confidentiality Order, understands it, and agrees to be bound by it.\nSigned by\nOlga Luftig\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 16, 2013\n",

Background and request for direction. 1\nII........... Positions of the Parties. 3\nA. Complainant 3\nB. Respondent 5\nIII......... Ruling. 6\nI. Background and request for direction [1] In Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 10 [Grant (decision)], this Tribunal found the Respondent had discriminated against the Complainant, pursuant to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. In sum, the Tribunal found that, despite being made aware of the Complainant\u2019s disability on various occasions and the effects of stress on her condition, the Respondent did not seriously consider whether the Complainant\u2019s disability was affecting her performance at work and how it could accommodate the Complainant in this regard. Rather, the Respondent simply appraised the Complainant\u2019s performance at work negatively, without considering her disability. As the Complainant\u2019s performance appraisals were used to compare her to another employee for the purposes of determining who would be laid-off, the Tribunal determined the Complainant\u2019s disability factored into the Respondent\u2019s decision to no longer employ her.\n[2] To remedy the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory practice, the Complainant sought the following remedy, among others:\nMissed Pension Contributions\n78. Had the complainant kept her employment with the respondent, she would have been entitled to the benefits of being a part of the MTS pension plan from the years 2007 to present (in addition, of course, to the previous years of her employment with the respondent). The pension plan of which the complainant was a part is a defined benefit pension plan. This means that upon retirement, the complainant is entitled to receive a pension in a defined amount based upon a certain formula. The members of this pension plan pay 7% of their wages each year and the respondent is responsible for ensuring that the obligations of the pension fund are met.\n79. In circumstances where an employee has been temporarily away from work, the respondent\u2019s portion of pension contributions is calculated at 7% of the employees\u2019 earning over the equivalent time.\n80. This calculation is only required if there is a circumstance where an employee is not returning to work for the respondent. If reinstatement with full net credit service date is ordered in this case, this calculation is not required.\n81. If reinstatement is not ordered, but liability is found, then the complainant\u2019s damages are estimated to be approximately $17,087.42.\n(Final Argument of the Complainant, dated March 16, 2011, at paras. 78-81)\n[3] In Grant (decision), the Tribunal retained jurisdiction on many of the remedies requested by the Complainant, including the missed pension contributions, in order to get further submissions and clarification from the parties (at para. 128).\n[4] Both parties were given the opportunity to provide additional submissions on the Complainant\u2019s outstanding remedial requests from Grant (decision) on a conference call on July 10, 2012.\n[5] In a subsequent decision, Heather Lynn Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 20 [Grant (remedies)], the Tribunal determined what remedial orders where necessary to address the Complainant\u2019s outstanding remedial requests from Grant (decision). Among other things, the Tribunal determined there was insufficient evidence to reassess who, among the Complainant and the other employee, should have been laid off. Rather, the Tribunal was of the view that, in the circumstances, it was remedying \u201c...the opportunity the Complainant lost to have her performance assessed in a non-discriminatory manner and, consequently, the possibility she shared with one other candidate of retaining her job with the Respondent\u201d (Grant (remedies) at para. 7). The Tribunal added: \u201cThe difficulty in fashioning an appropriate remedy in this case lies in the fact that, regardless of the discriminatory practice, there was at least a 50% possibility that the Complainant would have been laid off anyways\u201d (Grant (remedies) at para. 7).\n[6] Pursuant to this reasoning, the Tribunal ordered the following with regard to the Complainant\u2019s pension:\nThe Respondent shall restore the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her layoff. For the period from her lay off to the date when the terms of this order are implemented, the Respondent is to contribute to her pension plan half of the pension contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ. If it is not possible to restore the previous pension plan, arrangements should be made to restore the lost pension benefits as described above in a comparable plan or arrangement, ensuring that the Complainant can receive retirement benefits comparable to those she would have received through MTS. I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined in my reasons.\n(Grant (remedies) at para. 22)\n[7] In Grant (remedies), the Tribunal again retained jurisdiction in the event the parties were unable to reach an agreement on the pension remedy, among others (at para. 23).\n[8] The parties have been unable to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension and disagree on what remedy the Tribunal ordered with respect thereof.\n[9] The parties agree that the Respondent\u2019s obligation under the above order is to implement the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits to the position they were in at the time of her lay-off; and, that those benefits can be provided under the Respondent\u2019s pension plan. They disagree with respect to what is owed to the Complainant following the date of her lay-off: 50% of the pension contributions the Respondent would have made; or, 50% of the pension benefits the Complainant would have received, less the contributions the Complainant would have made.\n[10] The following ruling is to provide further direction to the parties with respect to the implementation of the Tribunal\u2019s order regarding the Complainant\u2019s pension.\nII. Positions of the Parties A. Complainant [11] The Complainant submits the Tribunal ordered the restoration of the Complainant\u2019s pension benefits.\n[12] The pension plan is a defined benefit plan and, consequently, the Respondent does not contribute a defined and certain amount at regular intervals. Rather, the Respondent contributes to the pension plan a sufficient amount, based on market conditions, to ensure retirees receive their specified, defined, set benefits. Therefore, according to the Complainant, the amount of the Respondent\u2019s contributions to the pension plan may have no bearing on the amount of benefits received by the Complainant.\n[13] Rather, the Complainant says the Tribunal\u2019s order was focused on making the Complainant whole and restoring her pension benefits. In this regard, at paragraphs 15 and 22 of Grant (remedies) the Complainant says the Tribunal appears to suggest a method to achieve the ultimate objective of making the Complainant whole and restoring her pension benefits: to contribute to her pension plan \u201chalf of the pension contributions it would have made during this period had the Complainant remained in its employ\u201d. The Complainant submits the Tribunal did not order the Respondent to simply pay into the pension plan an estimated amount of contributions, but rather it suggested that this may be one possibility or a possible method of achieving the ultimate goal of making the Complainant whole.\n[14] Accordingly, the Complainant is of the view that the Respondent is to ensure retirement benefits for the Complainant comparable to those she would have received as if she had not been laid off (minus 50%). The Complainant provided an actuarial report wherein it has calculated the amount of the benefit per month that the Complainant has lost as a result of being laid off by the Respondent.\n[15] In the alternative, if the Respondent is correct in interpreting Grant (remedies) as awarding pension contributions, as opposed to benefits, the Complainant submits the Respondent\u2019s assessment of contributions is incomplete. According to the Complainant, the Respondent\u2019s actuarial report only calculated normal contributions and failed to include special contributions and interest. When these amounts are added to the total normal contributions of $17,789.72 the total of all contributions is $98,863.81. If this amount were paid as a lump sum to the Complainant, she claims she would be made whole.\n[16] With regard to her final arguments pertaining to the pension remedy, the Complainant submits the following should be borne in mind: it was prepared in the context of what the Complainant viewed as the unlikely scenario that the complaint would be upheld but reinstatement not ordered; the calculation provided was prepared based upon circumstances that are now three years out of date; arguments advanced prior to the Tribunal\u2019s decision are not relevant to how the decision should be interpreted; and, the use of the concept of \u201ccontributions\u201d was a \u2018rough and ready\u2019 proxy for pension benefits in the absence of actuarial evidence.\nB. Respondent [17] The Respondent believes the Tribunal ordered it to pay 50% of the pension contributions it would have made from February 23, 2007 to the date the order is implemented. The Respondent\u2019s actuarial report calculates one half of its contributions from February 23, 2007 to June 1, 2013 to be $17,789.72.\n[18] According to the Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s order makes clear distinctions between: (a) points in time; and, (b) types of compensation. The two marked periods of time are: (a) the time of the lay-off; and, (b) the period following lay-off to the date the order is implemented. The two types of compensation are: (a) pension benefits; and, (b) pension contributions. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the order does not use the terms contributions and benefits interchangeably; and, the terms are tied to their own unique points in time.\n[19] As the Respondent interprets it, the order is consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to reinstate the Complainant\u2019s employment. The Respondent says the portion of the order pertaining to pension benefits coincides with the Complainant\u2019s term of employment with the Respondent. From thereafter, the order directs pension contributions to be made. According to the Respondent, it would be illogical to not reinstate employment, but reinstate pension benefits as if reinstatement had been ordered.\n[20] The Respondent acknowledges the Tribunal's jurisdiction to provide direction with respect to the implementation of its order and notes that the implementation of the order is the specific area the Tribunal expressly reserved jurisdiction over due to the lack of evidence pertaining to the administration of the Respondent\u2019s pension plan (see Grant (remedies) at para. 15). However, the Respondent notes that there was no reservation of jurisdiction with respect to the substantive order itself, and that the Tribunal is functus officio with respect to the actual pension remedy set out in the order.\n[21] The Respondent raises this issue because it views the Complainant's position and submissions as an attempt to revisit, or appeal, the pension order itself. According to the Respondent, up until this motion, the Complainant has always requested she be compensated for lost pension contributions, and not benefits. The Respondent submits that this was the Complainant\u2019s position in her Statement of Particulars and in her final written submissions filed after the hearing. In the Respondent view, the Complainant cannot now be heard to make a different request.\nIII. Ruling [22] The Respondent has interpreted the Tribunal\u2019s order correctly. The Tribunal did not award the Complainant half of her pension benefits for the period following her layoff. Rather, the award is for half of the employer\u2019s pension contributions for the period following the layoff.\n[23] Given the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to reinstate the Complainant, the order was crafted to distinguish between the period before and after her layoff. For the period up until her layoff, the Tribunal wanted to make clear that she should still receive the full benefit of her pension, which there is no dispute between the parties. For the period following her layoff, only half of the employer\u2019s pension contributions are awarded. Half, because the Tribunal is remedying the possibility the Complainant shared with one other candidate of retaining her job with the Respondent, and not the loss of the job itself; and, only the employer\u2019s pension contributions, because the Complainant did not lose her own contributions. She simply did not pay into the pension plan following her layoff.\n[24] The Tribunal does not have expertise in interpreting and calculating pensions. The Tribunal crafted the pension remedy based on the submissions of the parties and evidence before it at the time. During the July 2012 case conference call, where the parties were given the opportunity to provide submissions on the outstanding remedies from Grant (decision), the Complainant indicated that its calculations of the Respondent\u2019s missed pension contributions were an estimate in the absence of a calculation from an actuary. In fact, various sections of the pension plan in this case provide for adjustments and calculations of contributions and benefits based on recommendations from an actuary. This is why the Tribunal first left it to the parties to work out the details of the pension remedy:\nGiven the complexities and considerations that may be involved in determining the functionality of this order; given the lack of evidence permitting the Tribunal to best determine the functionality of this order; given the parties\u2019 acknowledgement that an actuary may need to be involved in making these pension calculations; and given that insufficient evidence was led before me to make such calculations, therefore, I will first leave it to the parties to work out the details of the Complainant\u2019s lost pension benefits pursuant to the parameters outlined above.\n(Grant (remedies) at para. 15)\n[25] In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the parties were in the best position to calculate the quantum of the pension remedy and determine how best to implement it. Unfortunately, the parties have been unable to reach an agreement on this issue.\n[26] That said, the parties have now presented the Tribunal with actuarial reports, which assist in determining this remedy. Both reports seem to be in agreement with respect to what half of the employer\u2019s normal contributions would be for the period of February 23, 2007 to June 1, 2013: $17,789.72.\n[27] However, in reply, the Complainant has raised an alternative argument and submitted a supplemental actuarial report, wherein it is argued the Respondent\u2019s report did not take into account special contributions and interest. Raising this alternative argument and supplemental report in reply is not helpful to determining the issue at hand and is unfair to the Respondent. The alternative argument should have been raised as part of the Complainant\u2019s initial submissions on the issue at hand.\n[28] That said, in the interests of justice, the Tribunal wants ensure the Complainant, a victim of discrimination, receives the full amount that is due to her under the Tribunal\u2019s order. This is not a question of revisiting the Tribunal\u2019s pension order, but ensuring the order is implemented properly.\n[29] On this basis, the Respondent is to provide a response to the Complainant\u2019s supplemental actuarial report and, more specifically, on the issues of special contributions and interests, by January 31, 2014. Following which, the Complainant will have until February 28, 2014 to provide a reply. The Complainant is reminded that the purpose of the reply is not to raise new arguments, but to respond to those raised by the Respondent.\n[30] Following the additional submissions, and only if the Tribunal deems it necessary, a case conference call may be held to seek further clarification from the parties on their additional submissions.\n[31] I will continue to retain jurisdiction on the pension remedy until such time as it is finally determined.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nDecember 19, 2013\n",

Background [1] An inquiry by this Tribunal has been requested by the Commission pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [the Act]. The Complainant alleges discrimination on the bases of sex and disability pursuant to ss. 7, 10 and 14 of the Act.\n[2] On the 24th day of January 2013, the Respondent requested disclosure of medical documentation from the Complainant and documents from her personal injury action related to her 2007 motor vehicle accident.\n[3] Member Marchildon, on March 20th, 2013, made a ruling that set out in considerable detail the position of the parties as it related to the Respondent\u2019s request for:\n(a) the Complainant\u2019s medical documents from April 1st, 2007 to present;\n(b) her unredacted psychiatrist\/psychologist files;\n(c) documents related to her personal injury action; and,\n(d) the settlement agreement from her personal injury action.\n[4] Member Marchildon ruled on issue (a), the Complainant\u2019s medical documents, and issues (c) and (d), the documents relating to her personal injury action and the settlement agreement (which provided for further submissions by the third party to the agreement). Therefore, this ruling will not deal with items (a) and (c). The parties have exchanged some further correspondence on item (d), with the Complainant indicating that she has been unable to locate the three defendants who were party to the settlement agreement. Subject to further discussion on item (d) at the next case management conference call on January 9th, 2014, I will rule on that item at that time or at a later date.\n[5] Member Marchildon, with respect to issue (b), the Complainant\u2019s redacted psychiatrist\/psychologist files, requested further submissions from the parties and this matter will be addressed later in this ruling.\n[6] The Complainant, subsequent to the Respondent\u2019s request for disclosure dated January 24th, 2013, made an informal disclosure request by way of letter dated February 28th, 2013, requesting the following information:\n(a) notes, summaries or other information recorded following Barry Hicks\u2019 interview of Michelle Baly on or about September 28, 2000, referenced in RCMP 2.0065;\n(b) the entire contents of the Code of Conduct file related to the Investigation into S\/Sgt. Lunn (File 2000CQ-34116), including but not limited to notes, summaries, and other documents prepared or collected by Barry Hicks and Ric Hall;\n(c) notes taken by Barry Hicks and Ric Hall related to the Code of Conduct referred to in (b) above that are not contained in the Code of Conduct file;\n(d) Cst. Eric Lenger\u2019s curriculum vitae, application materials and notes or emails related to his application for the INSET position to which he was posted in or around November 2005, including any comments regarding concerns related to past allegations of obstruction;\n(e) Cpl. Kneckt\u2019s curriculum vitae, application materials and notes or emails related to his application for the Team GIS position to which he was posted in or around October 2006;\n(f) all materials\/files related to an investigation into an incident in the Coquitlam Green Team whereby members\u2019 names were written onto an RCMP garbage can (we believe this to be RCMP Internal Investigation files 01-309 and\/or 02-246);\n(g) \u201cE\u201d Division harassment file #2007-22106 regarding S\/Sgt. Steve Seward and Insp. Bob Wood, which we believe contains emails confirming Cpl. Rai was selected as the successful candidate for Team GIS; and\n(h) emails from Ric Hall to Harjinder Rai in or around January 2001, wherein Ric Hall says nothing can be done about her Complaint against S\/Sgt Lunn; and\n(i) any internal investigation guidebook, handbook or policy governing investigation of Code of Conduct or harassment complaints in 2000-2001.\n[7] The Complainant, in a letter of April 12th, 2013, expanded her requests in (d) and (e) above to include:\n\u2022 application materials (formal or informal) (at para. 8);\n\u2022 information regarding Cst. Lenger\u2019s disciplinary record (at para. 8); and,\n\u2022 curricula vitae for the successful candidates, or alternatively, documentation from the relevant time regarding those candidates\u2019 backgrounds, training, experience, performance records or other considerations relevant to the selection process (at para. 10).\n[8] The Commission, on February 27th, 2013, requested the following:\n(a) any recent study on sexual harassment within the RCMP;\n(b) any recent report on sexual harassment within the RCMP;\n(c) \u201cE\u201d Division RCMP employee Your-say survey conducted by \u201cE\u201d Division Operations Strategy Branch, June-July, 2012; and,\n(d) \u201cE\u201d Division Royal Canadian Mounted Police Summary Report on Gender Based Harassment and Respectful Workplace Consultations, April 17, 2012.\nII. Ruling [9] The matters presently before the Tribunal are: (A) the Respondent\u2019s request for the Complainant\u2019s unredacted psychiatrist\/psychologist files; (B) the Commission\u2019s request for disclosure dated February 27th, 2013; and, (C) the Complainant\u2019s requests for disclosure dated February 28th, 2013 and April 12th, 2013.\n[10] The matter before the Tribunal was first commenced by the Respondent for disclosure and other requests were commenced and formulated by correspondence from the Complainant and the Commission. The requirement of full disclosure is fundamental for a fair hearing. There is certainly no dispute between the parties as to their disclosure requirements. However, the issue of relevancy of evidence is a question that causes the parties concerns. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (the Rules), at paras. 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e), require disclosure, which Member Marchildon made reference to in paragraph 28 of her ruling of March 20th, 2013 (2013 CHRT 6).\n[11] Being mindful of the principles of the aforesaid, the following is the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the request by the Respondent, the Complainant and the Commission for disclosure of documents.\nA. Respondent\u2019s erquest for unredacted psychiatrist\/psychologist files [12] Member Marchildon in her ruling set a time frame for parties to provide submissions on this issue. The Complainant, by way of a letter dated April 4th, 2013, set forth a proposal which states as follows:\nDr. Babbage's file consists of six pages, only one of which contains redactions. Dr. Sanders' file is seven pages long and four of those pages contain redactions. We have disclosed to the RCMP an unredacted copy of all of the documents that we have received from Dr. Flamer's office in response to our request for disclosure of his file. Given that only five pages are at issue, we submit that it is appropriate for the Tribunal to review the pages at issue along with the complaint and the response to the complaint to determine whether the information contained therein tends to lead to a train of inquiry that tends to prove or disprove a material fact at issue and to adjudicate the validity of Cpl. Rai's claim of privilege.\n[13] The Respondent, by way of a letter dated April 12th, 2013, responded as follows:\nWith regard to the redacted medical records the Complainant has produced, the Respondent agrees with Complainant's approach to the redactions as outlined in her letter of April 4, 2013. However, in addition to redacting the psychiatrist and psychologist files, the Complainant has also extensively redacted the clinical notes of the Complainant's family doctor, Dr. Andre Bredenkarnp. The Complainant replaced 16 pages of Dr. Bredenkarnp's clinical records with 16 blank pages entitled \"irrelevant\". The Respondent requests that the Tribunal direct the Complainant to produce Dr. Bredenkarnp's file in its entirety.\n[14] To a large degree the issue has been resolved by the parties by correspondence as set forth above, a resolution of which the Tribunal adopts. The Tribunal adopts the position, as it relates to the files of Dr. Babbage and Dr. Saunders, that the redacted pages of their files be forwarded to the Tribunal to ascertain whether privilege applies.\n[15] The issue of Dr. Bredenkamp\u2019s clinical records will be dealt with in the same manner as Dr. Babbage and Dr. Saunder\u2019s files. The Complainant is directed to forward the 16 redacted pages of Dr. Bredenkamp\u2019s file for review by the Tribunal and a decision is to be made as to the appropriateness of disclosure and relevancy of same.\nB. Commission\u2019s request for disclosure [16] The Commission has requested by letter of February 27th, 2013, a number of reports and studies that are in the possession of the Respondent. The Respondent has taken the position that the matters are not relevant to the complaint and have no bearing on these proceedings.\n[17] The Respondent, in support of its position, relies on Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 [Moore], paragraph 64 (incorrectly stated as paragraph 66), where the Supreme Court of Canada stated:\nIn this case, the claim was made on behalf of Jeffrey, and the evidence giving concrete support to the claim all centred on him. While the Tribunal was certainly entitled to consider systemic evidence in order to determine whether Jeffrey had suffered discrimination, it was unnecessary for it to hold an extensive inquiry into the precise format of the provincial funding mechanism or the entire provincial administration of special education in order to determine whether Jeffrey was discriminated against. The Tribunal, with great respect, is an adjudicator of the particular claim that is before it, not a Royal Commission.\n[18] According to the Commission, the central issues in this case are allegations of sexual harassment in different units within the RCMP and the alleged failure of the RCMP to adequately address the sexual harassment and provide a harassment-free workplace. In light of this, it submits that any recent studies or reports on sexual harassment within the RCMP are arguably relevant to the issues in the complaint, including proper systemic remedies. The Commission has submitted and relied on the decision of Warman v. Bahr, 2006 CHRT 18, at paragraphs 6-7. Based on this decision, it argues the threshold for arguable relevance is low and the tendency is now towards more, not less, disclosure because it is difficult at the disclosure stage to determine whether a document may ultimately be relevant at the hearing of the complaint.\n[19] In the present circumstances, I find that the Commission has established arguable relevance of the requested material and, therefore, that the requested reports shall be disclosed. While the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is focused on the whether the Complainant has suffered discrimination, it is well established that evidence of a systemic problem can be used to determine whether the individual complainant may have suffered discrimination (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 1998 CanLII 7740 (FC), at para. 22; and Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445, at paras. 389-390). In fact, despite the Respondent\u2019s reliance on Moore, in my view, this decision actually supports the requested disclosure, as stated in the following excerpt: \u201cthe Tribunal was certainly entitled to consider systemic evidence in order to determine whether Jeffrey had suffered discrimination...\u201d (Moore, supra, at para. 64).\nC. Complainant\u2019s requests for disclosure (i) Requests (a) to (c) [20] At the last case management conference call held on October 22nd, 2013, Respondent counsel confirmed that all materials related to issues (a) to (c) have been produced in the Respondent\u2019s disclosure to date, and advised that she has made best efforts to gather those documents. Complainant counsel confirmed she is satisfied with Respondent counsel\u2019s efforts to find such documents. Therefore, this is no longer an issue.\n(ii) Requests (d) and (e) [21] According to the Complainant, the relevancy of the requested documents stems from her allegation that the Respondent\u2019s discriminatory actions resulted in her losing out on the potential for further advancement through specialized experience in the INSET and Team GIS positions. The Respondent claims these positions were filled by qualified candidates. Therefore, the Complainant claims the qualifications of those candidates are directly at issue in the complaint.\n[22] At the last case management conference call, Complainant counsel advised that her request for documents under (d) and (e) would be satisfied with a curriculum vitae or other documents that essentially create a curriculum vitae. In previous correspondence, Complainant counsel suggested that the documents requested, or similar listings of experiences, training and qualifications are available on the RCMP's human resources management system (HRMIS).\n[23] At the last case management conference call, Respondent counsel confirmed that she will seek instructions from her client regarding the disclosure of documents related to requests (d) and (e).\n[24] I agree with the Complainant that these documents are arguably relevant. The Respondent will use best efforts to obtain the information requested through reviewing the personnel files of Cst. Eric Lenger and Cpl. Keneckt, as suggested by the Complainant. Whether or not the documents are admissible at the hearing and, if so, what evidentiary weight they have, is yet to be determined; however, they should be disclosed.\n(iii) Request (f) [25] The disclosure of request (f) is still outstanding; however, at the last case management conference call, Respondent counsel advised that she is in the process of redacting said documents and that she intends to produce those documents after the redaction has been completed. Therefore, no ruling is necessary at this time.\n(iv) Request (g) [26] At the last case management conference call, Respondent counsel confirmed that it was her intention to produce all relevant portions of this file as per Complainant counsel\u2019s request, and, therefore, no ruling is required at this time.\n(v) Request (h) [27] At the last case management conference call, Respondent counsel advised and confirmed that she has made all efforts to obtain these documents. She advised that she requested emails from Ric Hall and confirmed that he does not have the requested emails. Complainant counsel inquired whether Respondent counsel has made any other attempts to obtain the emails or retrieve them electronically other than asking Mr. Hall whether those documents exist. Respondent counsel confirmed that those documents are not in the possession of her client and that she does not have access to them. In light of the forgoing, the Tribunal makes no ruling with respect to this request.\n(vi) Request (i) [28] This was addressed at the last case management conference call. Respondent counsel advised that there does not appear to be any internal investigation guidebook, but that more general documents with regard to this have been listed on the Respondent\u2019s most recent supplemental list of documents. Respondent counsel also advised that in 2000\u20132001, the Respondent did not have a detailed harassment policy. Therefore, no ruling is necessary on this issue.\nIII. Next case management conference call [29] At the next case management conference call scheduled on January 9th, 2014, the parties are to provide the Tribunal with an update regarding all outstanding disclosure items addressed in this ruling, including issues regarding the disclosure of the Complainant\u2019s settlement agreement from her personal injury action (regarding para. 4).\nSigned by\nGeorge E.

Motion to Consolidate the Hearing of Two Complaints [1] This ruling relates to a request made by the Complainant, Ashraf Karimi, seeking an order consolidating two Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) Files (Nos. T1616\/16210 and T1783\/1312) for the purpose of a single hearing.\n[2] On November 4, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act), the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Chairperson of the Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint of Ms. Karimi against MTS Allstream Inc. (the Respondent). In this first complaint (Tribunal File No. T1616\/16210), the Complainant alleges the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice, pursuant to section 7 of the Act.\n[3] On February 1, 2012, the Commission requested an inquiry into a second complaint by Ms. Karimi against the Respondent. In the second complaint (Tribunal File No. T1783\/1312), the Complainant alleges the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice, pursuant to section 7 of the Act; and, that the Respondent retaliated against her in response to her first complaint, in contravention of section 14.1 of the Act.\n[4] Following a Case Management Conference Call held on November 2, 2012, all parties confirmed that the motion to consolidate the two complaints should be dealt with by way of written submissions.\nII. Positions of the Parties [5] After reading the submissions of the parties on this motion to consolidate, the Tribunal summarizes their respective positions as follows.\nA. The Complainant [6] The purpose of the Complainant\u2019s motion to consolidate the proceedings is to allow for a joint hearing of her two complaints.\n[7] The Complainant\u2019s Notice of Motion lays out the following grounds for the motion:\n1. Both complaints involve the same parties.\n2. Both complaints contain allegations of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate.\n3. The second complaint alleges reprisal for filing the first complaint.\n4. There is overlap in both the witnesses to be called and the documents to be relied upon in both complaints.\n5. The Complainant will call the same expert witness, a psychiatrist, in relation to both complaints.\n6. Both complaints contain similar legal issues.\n7. There is no prejudice to any party in hearing both complaints together. Doing so benefits both parties.\n8. It is in the Tribunal\u2019s best interests with respect to time, expense and consistency in decisions that both complaints are heard together.\n9. The Act, with particular regard to section 40(4), which does not deal specifically with multiple complaints by a single Complainant, but suggests if there are similar issues of facts and law, complaints can be heard together.\n10. And, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure with particular regard to Rule 1(1) with respect to proceedings being conducted in a timely, efficient and expeditious manner.\n[8] Paragraphs 2 to 4 of the Complainant\u2019s Affidavit in support of the motion outline the allegations made in her two complaints:\n2. The primary allegation in my first complaint is gender discrimination. A secondary issues (sic) is disability discrimination and the failure to accommodate.\n3. With respect to disability, my first complaint alleges that I was overwhelmed with tasks that I was physically unable to complete upon return from short-term disability. Furthermore, my first complaint alleges a failure to accommodate by the respondent disallowing me to work from home when other employees were permitted to do so.\n4. The primary allegation in my second complaint is disability discrimination and a failure to accommodate. A secondary allegation is reprisal for having filed my first complaint.\n[9] The following paragraphs of the Complainant\u2019s Affidavit summarize her argument as to why she is seeking to consolidate the hearing of her two complaints:\nSimilar Witnesses\n6. Since both complaints are between myself and MTS Allstream Inc., it is likely that the same witnesses will be called to testify at both hearings if heard separately. Originally, there were two individuals noted as respondents to the second complaint, but they are no longer parties.\nSimilar Documents\n7. The documents in both complaints will be similar and include many of the same MTS Allstream policy documents, the governing collective agreement, medical documents and wage loss documents.\nSame Expert\n8. If the complaints are heard separately, my expert witness, Dr. Kiraly, will have to be called on two occasions at significant expense to myself and significant inconvenience to the witness. Attached to this affidavit and marked as Exhibit \u201cA\u201d is a copy of Dr. Kiraly\u2019s expert report. Dr. Kiraly is a psychiatrist and will testify as to how the gender discrimination in my first complaint was a significant precipitating factor to my mental health challenges, including depression, that are involved in my second complaint.\nSimilar Legal Issues\n9. In both my first and second complaints, I allege disability discrimination and a failure to accommodate, which was ongoing during the time periods referred to in both complaints. As well, my second complaint alleges reprisal in response to my first complaint. It seems to me that these related legal issues should be decided together.\nNo Prejudice to the Respondent\n10. There is no prejudice to the respondent in having the complaints heard together. Doing so will actually reduce the total hearing time by avoiding the unnecessary repetition of information and reduce inconvenience to the respondent\u2019s witnesses.\n11. Through counsel, I have asked MTS Allstream Inc. to consent to consolidate the two hearings, but they have refused, hence the necessity for this motion.\nHearing the Complaints Together is Best for the Tribunal\n12. Hearing the complaints together will save the Tribunal time and expense by reducing total hearing time.\n13. The analysis of disability discrimination and failure to accommodate which will be required both complaints and addressing issues of credibility ought to be dealt with the tribunal together to avoid the risk of inconsistent findings and results.\nB. The Respondent [10] The Respondent\u2019s position with respect to the Complainant\u2019s motion is stated in the first paragraph of its submissions:\n1. The Respondent MTS Allstream Inc. (\u201cAllstream\u201d) opposes the Complainant\u2019s motion to consolidate Tribunal Files No. T1783\/1312 (the \u201cFirst Complaint\u201d) and T1616\/16210 (the \u201cSecond Complaint\u201d) (together the \u201cComplaints\u201d) so that both files may be heard together. Allstream respectfully submits that the motion should be denied.\n[11] The essence of the Respondent\u2019s position is found in the following abstract of paragraph 4 of its submissions:\n4. [...] While the Complaints both relate to the Complainant\u2019s employment at Allstream, they concern different time periods, different grounds of alleged discrimination and make specific allegations against different individuals.\n[12] Specifically, the following is a list of what I understand to be the main objections of the Respondent in opposition to the consolidation of the two complaints:\n\u2022 In the first complaint, gender was the only alleged ground of discrimination (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 5).\n\u2022 The first complaint made reference to the Complainant\u2019s alleged disability but did not allege that the Complainant was subjected to discrimination or any adverse treatment on the basis of that alleged disability (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 5).\n\u2022 The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of discrimination on any other ground, including disability, in respect of the first complaint (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 6).\n\u2022 The allegations of discrimination in the two complaints cover different time periods and refer to actions by different people. Namely, the first complaint makes allegations against Mr. Picard for the period of March 2005 to October 2008. Mr. Picard is not mentioned in the second complaint. The second complaint makes allegations against Mr. Rooney for the period of October 2008 to February 2010. Mr. Rooney is not mentioned in the first complaint (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at paras. 7 & 8).\n\u2022 Consolidation of the two complaints is not necessary to determine the allegation of reprisal (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 9).\n\u2022 The parties will be required to call different witnesses and to present different documentary evidence in respect of each complaint but, since there is significant differences between the allegations contained in the two complaints, there will be minimal repetition of evidence (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at para 10).\n\u2022 \u201c[I]n light of the wholly different allegations in each of the Complaints, there is no risk of inconsistent findings\u201d (Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 11).\n\u2022 \u201cThe consolidation of the Complaints will not save the parties time or expense\u201d (Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 13).\n[13] According to the Respondent, it will be prejudiced by the consolidation of the two complaints. The following is what I understand to be the Respondent\u2019s main arguments in this regard:\n\u2022 As the first complaint alleged discrimination on the basis of gender only, consolidation of the two complaints would expand the grounds of the first complaint to include allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability (see Respondent\u2019s submissions at paras. 16-18).\n\u2022 \u201cThe Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability in respect of the First Complaint\u201d (Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 17).\n\u2022 \u201c[I]f the Complainant is permitted to expand the grounds of the First Complaint\u2026[t]his would place Allstream in the unfair position of having to defend itself against new allegations that are more than five years old\u201d (Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 19).\n\u2022 \u201cIf the Complaints are heard together, Allstream respectfully submits that significant procedural protections would be necessary in order to ensure that there is no confusion between the Complaints to the prejudice of Allstream\u201d (Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 20).\n\u2022 \u201cIn addition to calling separate witnesses and documentary evidence for each of the Complaints, the parties will likely be required to make separate arguments in respect of each Complaint. As noted above, this is likely to extend the length of the hearing significantly and use more of the Tribunal\u2019s limited resources\u201d (Respondent\u2019s submissions at para. 20).\nC. The Commission [14] The Commission, in a letter dated September 10, 2012, responded to the motion to consolidate the hearing of the complaints as follows:\nThe Commission does not take a position regarding the Motion to merge both complaints in a single hearing in this matter. However, normally if both complaints involve the same parties and the facts have a certain connectivity in the employment relationship, it may be in the interests of justice to have a single hearing before the same member.\nHaving said, the parties can put forth the factual and legal arguments which justifies their respective positions and the Tribunal can make the determination which it deems appropriate which ensure procedural fairness, efficiency of costs and the interest of justice.\nWe bring the attention of the parties the following matter on this issue Karen Schuyler v. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 CHRT 10 (CanLII). Member Hadjis states at par.8 of his decision the following:\n\u2018(8) The Tribunal has had occasion in the past to rule on whether to allow the amendment of an existing complaint of discrimination in order to add a claim of retaliation under s. 14.1 (see e.g. Kavanagh v. Correctional Services of Canada (May 31, 1999), T505\/2298 (C.H.R.T.); Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 (CanLII), 2004 CHRT 2; Blondin v. Purolator Courier Ltd., 2005 CHRT 7 (CanLII), 2005 CHRT 7). It has been observed in these cases that it makes sense for evidence of acts made in reprisal to an existing human rights complaint, to be heard within the context of the hearing into that complaint. Before granting such amendments, however, the Tribunal should be satisfied that the respondent is not prejudiced by a lack of sufficient notice of the new allegations. The respondent must be given the chance to properly defend itself.\u2019\n[15] In a further correspondence to the parties and to the Tribunal, dated October 1, 2012, the Commission provided a copy of the decision rendered in Anne Marsden v. Public Works and Government Services Canada and Courts Administration Service, 2012 CHRT 21. The Commission explains the utility of this decision as follows:\nSince the issue of consolidation is a live issue between the parties, I am attaching a recent decision of the Tribunal on a similar issue which can inform.\nIII. Analysis [16] In Lattey v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 2002 CanLII 45928 (CHRT) [Lattey], the Tribunal noted that the issue of whether to hold a single hearing or multiple hearings into complaints is, in the absence of any specific statutory direction, a procedural matter that the Tribunal has the authority to address as master of its own procedure (see Lattey at para. 12; and, Cruden v. Canadian International Development Agency & Health Canada and Wheatcroft v. Canadian International Development Agency, 2010 CHRT 32 at paras. 10-11). In determining requests to consolidate hearings, some of the factors the Tribunal considers include:\n1. The public interest in avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, including considerations of expense, delay, the convenience of the witnesses, reducing the need for the repetition of evidence, and the risk of inconsistent results;\n2. The potential prejudice to the respondents that could result from a single hearing, including the lengthening of the hearing for each respondent as issues unique to the other respondent are dealt with, and the potential for confusion that may result from the introduction of evidence that may not relate to the allegations specifically involving one respondent or the other; and\n3. Whether there are common issues of fact or law.\n(Lattey at para. 12)\nUltimately, the Tribunal must ensure that its proceedings are conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow (see subsection 48.9(1) of the Act; and, Rule 1(1)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04)).\n[17] Many of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the consolidation of the hearing of the two complaints derive from its interpretation of the first complaint form. Based on this form, it has concluded that the inquiry into the first complaint should be restricted to discrimination on the basis of gender, and that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to inquire into allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to the first complaint. According to the Respondent, it will be significantly prejudiced in its ability to defend against new allegations that are permitted to bleed into the first complaint.\n[18] However, in analyzing the present motion, I find limiting oneself to the examination of the first complaint form gives an incomplete picture of the matter. Along with the submissions of parties on the present motion, the Tribunal also has the benefit of Statements of Particulars from the parties regarding the first complaint. In her motion materials and in her Statement of Particulars with respect to the first complaint, the Complainant explains the nature of her first complaint as including allegations of discrimination on the basis of disability. In this regard, the following statement from the Tribunal is instructive:\nThe complaint form is there primarily for the purposes of the Commission. It is a necessary first step, which raises a set of facts that call for further investigation. The complaint form provides an important starting point and is inherently approximate. It was never intended to serve the purposes of a pleading in adjudicative process leading up to a hearing. It is the Statements of Particulars, rather than the original complaint, that set the more precise terms of the hearing.\n[...]\nAs long as they can be tracked back to the facts and allegations that went before the Commission, and do not prejudice the Respondent, amendments should be allowed. This assists all of the parties in \u201cdetermining the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d.\n(Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1, at paras. 10 and 13, emphasis added)\n[19] The present motion is not to amend the first complaint or, conversely, to strike out portions of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars with respect to the first complaint. For the purposes of the present motion, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether an allegation of discrimination on the basis of disability properly forms part of the first complaint.\n[20] Whether there is one hearing or two, the Complainant\u2019s allegations will remain the same. The Respondent\u2019s concerns about defending against \u201cnew allegations\u201d on the basis of disability can be addressed through the exchange of Statements of Particulars with regard to the second complaint. At that point, the Respondent will be able to address and challenge any perceived conflation of the facts and issues with respect to the first and second complaint prior to the hearing. As mentioned above, it is the parties\u2019 Statement of Particulars that set the more precise terms of the hearing. Therefore, I do not accept the Respondent\u2019s contention that consolidating the hearing of the two complaints will result in prejudice through the conflation of the facts and issues between the two complaints.\n[21] The Respondent also argues there are insufficient common issues of fact and law to warrant consolidation. According to the Respondent, the two complaints refer to different time periods and make allegations that involve different individuals. The Respondent adds that as the Complainant alleges different types of discrimination, different legal tests apply.\n[22] In my view, there are common issues of fact and law in this matter and I will address each of the Respondent\u2019s arguments in this regard in turn.\n[23] First, while the two complaints refer to different periods of time, those time periods are continuous. On this issue, I would add that the second complaint includes an allegation of retaliation for having filed the first complaint. Since the allegation of retaliation covers the period following the filing of the first complaint, \u201cit makes sense for evidence of acts made in reprisal to an existing human rights complaint, to be heard within the context of the hearing into that complaint\u201d (Karen Schuyler v. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 CHRT 10 at para. 8).\n[24] Second, the Respondent argues, since the actors in each of the two complaints are not the same (see paras. 7 & 8 of the Respondent\u2019s submission), there are insufficient common issues of fact between the two complaints. I wish to point out that this is partly inexact since Jennifer Bazinet, who was the Complainant\u2019s manager at one time, is mentioned in the two complaints. According to the Complainant, Ms. Bazinet has been involved in some of the incidents mentioned in both complaints. Here are some abstracts of her allegations made in each of her complaints where the name of Jennifer Bazinet is mentioned:\nComplaint Form #1 (at page 4, para. 3):\nOn Feb. 4 2008 my request for a Project Management course was rejected by the manager, Jennifer Bazinet, in my new department. The manager informed me that the course \u201cwas not in line with your skills and development.\u201d\nComplaint Form #1 (at page 4, para.5):\nOn March 5, 2008, Jennifer Bazinet and HR set up a meeting for me [...] in the meeting they requested that I should change my attitude.\nComplaint Form #2 ( at para. 10):\nOn October 26, 2009, Jennifer Bazinet (\u201cBazinet\u201d), Karimi\u2019s immediate manager, told Karimi that she would have to return to work on a full-time basis the following week.\nComplaint Form #2 (at para. 12):\nOn Nov. 19, 2009, Karimi met with MTS representatives, including Bazinet [...] Karimi was told that MTS would no longer accommodate her working 3 days per week as it had done since March 31, 2009. In spite of Dr. Malkin\u2019s October 22, 2009 note confirming that Karimi could not return to work full-time[...]\nComplaint Form #2 (at para. 22):\nKarimi submits that MTS is vicariously liable for all actions taken by Rooney. [...] Rooney devised the discriminatory practices implemented by Bazinet, Stammer and Van Horne.\n[25] That said, overall, I do no find it relevant that the first complaint makes allegations involving different individuals than the second. MTS Allstream Inc. is the respondent in both complaints and the individuals named in each complaint are its employees. The Complainant explains in her two complaints how each one of them, at different moments, was involved in the alleged discriminatory practices. Hearing from these people in a single hearing would facilitate the examination and the understanding of the evolution of the Complainant\u2019s situation.\n[26] Third, the Respondent argues the two complaints make allegations involving different types of discrimination, which calls for different legal tests. However, both complaints allege a discriminatory practice under section 7 of the Act. While the second complaint also includes an allegation under section 14.1, that does not change the legal test or burden that the Complainant must establish in both complaints: a prima facie case. That is, in both complaints, the Complainant must present a case \u201c...which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2026\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para. 28).\n[27] Finally, the Respondent is of the view that there will not be any efficiency gained by having one hearing. Specifically, the Respondent contends the length and complexity of one hearing will be affected by the separate witnesses, documentary evidence, and legal argument that will be advanced to address each complaint.\n[28] I am of the opinion that holding only one hearing to cover the facts alleged in the two complaints would save time and money for both parties, for some of the witnesses and for the Tribunal as well. None of the witnesses would have to testify twice. This would be the case for at least the following potential witnesses: the Complainant, the Complainant\u2019s expert, Dr. Malkin, and Ms. Jennifer Bazinet. Furthermore, the time for opening and closing statements and for argumentation would be reduced. Overall, I believe there is an economy of time to be gained by having a single hearing, which would allow both complaints to proceed more expeditiously pursuant to subsection 48.9(1) of the Act and Rule 1(1)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04).\n[29] Therefore, I conclude that there are common issues of fact and law between both complaints. Furthermore, consolidating the hearing of the two complaints would shorten the time required for the hearing and will not prejudice the Respondent. As a result, I believe a single hearing into both complaints is warranted. However, the fact that I have concluded that the two complaints should be dealt with at a single hearing should not be interpreted as meaning that either of the two complaints is well founded in fact or in law.\nIV. Ruling [30] For the above mentioned reasons, the Complainant\u2019s request to consolidate the hearing of her two complaints is granted. The Tribunal will conduct one hearing for both complaints.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 7, 2013\n",

Direction on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Oral Hearing on Motion on Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction 10\nI. Context [1] The Complainant is a video subscriber with the Respondent who relies on audio because of his vision disability. The Complainant filed a human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on May 2, 2012, alleging that the Respondent discriminated against him in the provision of a service on the basis of disability contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RCS 1985, c H-6 (the Act). The Complainant alleged that the Respondent did not accommodate his disability by not providing a descriptive video service (DVS), by not providing a means to easily turn DVS on and off, and finally, by failing to provide equipment and software that provides audible descriptions of on-screen menus. The first two of these issues have since been resolved before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (the CRTC). The Complainant\u2019s outstanding complaint, referred to the Tribunal by the Commission on May 8, 2012, is with respect to the Respondent\u2019s alleged failure to provide equipment and software that provides audible descriptions of on-screen menus. The Complainant asserts that the technology is available for the provision of such a service. The Respondent submits that this technology is not currently available and its development is dependent on third party manufacturers.\n[2] On December 17, 2012, the Respondent filed a Notice of Motion for a Confidentiality Order by the Tribunal, seeking to protect the confidential nature of documents containing private, commercial and proprietary technical information not available to the public. On December 20, 2012, the Tribunal held a Case Management Conference Call (CMCC) with the parties during which parties discussed the Respondent\u2019s motion. The Tribunal directed that the parties attempt to work together to draft a Confidentiality Agreement which could then be endorsed by the Tribunal.\n[3] On January 16, 2013, the Tribunal held another CMCC during which the parties presented their positions regarding a Draft Confidentiality Agreement. While the Complainant and Respondent were both willing to sign the revised agreement, the Commission objected. For reasons detailed below, in light of the parties\u2019 failure to arrive at an agreement, the Tribunal is now compelled to rule on the Respondent\u2019s motion.\nII. Parties\u2019 Positions [4] In its motion dated December 17, 2012, the Respondent contends that the information exchanged between MTS and the suppliers of Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) software and equipment vendors which led to the provision of the Ultimate TV service to which the Complainant subscribes is confidential and subject to a confidentiality clause. In addition, the Respondent submits that many of the other responses it received from other suppliers and vendors as part of this process contained private financial and proprietary technical information which were provided to MTS under the auspices of a confidentiality agreement. The Respondent\u2019s motion aims to protect the confidential nature of this information.\n[5] The Complainant did not initially agree with the terms of the order proposed by the Respondent in its motion. However, following an attempt by both parties to modify the terms of the order in a manner acceptable to all, the Complainant and the Respondent consented to an agreement in the following terms:\n1. The Complainant, the Commission and any Interested Parties, and their lawyers, are deemed to undertake not to use the evidence or information disclosed in these proceedings for any purposes other than those of these proceedings.\n2. Subject to the provisions in this Order, the Respondent shall produce to counsel for the Complainant and the Commission, the documents identified in the Respondent's Revised List of Documents as Numbers 3.1, all documents under heading 3.2, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 4.1 (hereinafter the \"Confidential Documents\"). The Tribunal may require similar disclosure to any Interested Party, to be determined at the time of adding any such Interested Party.\n3. The Complainant, the Commission and any Interested Parties, and their lawyers will instruct any witnesses or any individual to whom the Confidential Documents are disclosed for the purposes of these proceedings, of the terms of this Order and the deemed undertaking herein shall apply to that witness or other person.\n4. If any of the parties, their counsel, and\/or their witnesses wish to refer to any of the names of the third parties or any proprietary or financial information referred to in the Confidential Documents at any hearing in these proceedings, they shall advise the Tribunal prior to doing so and that portion of any hearing at which any such information is referred to or discussed shall be conducted in camera.\n5. This Order does not apply to:\na. Information which was lawfully or without legal restriction in the possession of the Complainant or the Commission prior to the date of this Order;\nb. Information derived independently of disclosure hereunder;\nc. Information lawfully obtained from a person having a right to disclose such information; nor\nd. Information that becomes publicly available through means other than a breach of this Order.\n6. Any Confidential Documents provided by way of disclosure in these proceedings, or any copies thereof made or used by the parties, their counsel or their witnesses in the course of these proceedings, shall be destroyed or returned to Respondent's counsel at the conclusion of these proceedings.\n7. The termination of these proceedings shall not relieve any person to whom Confidential Documents were disclosed pursuant to this Order from the obligations imposed on them in accordance with the provisions of this Order.\n8. In the event that any issues or differences arise out of this Order, the parties may contact the Tribunal to make further submissions.\n[6] The Commission disagrees with the confidentiality order proposed by the Respondent and the Complainant for a number of reasons. The Commission submits that there already exists an implied confidentiality undertaking that parties are not to disclose documentary evidence in a Tribunal proceeding, making a confidentiality order of this kind unnecessary. The Commission takes issue with section 4 of the order in particular, which provides for instances where portions of the hearing would be held in camera. The Commission argues that section 52 of the Act lists exceptions to the general rule that Tribunal inquiries be conducted in public and that these exceptions are more appropriately raised during the hearing as opposed to in advance in a confidentiality order. The Commission also submits that the destruction of documentary evidence at the conclusion of the proceedings provided for at section 6 of the order is cause for concern as this is not normally done. Overall, the Commission expressed that it failed to see why the present matter, in comparison with the other cases before the Tribunal, would require a confidentiality order of this kind and is concerned with setting such a precedent for future hearings.\nIII. Analysis and Decision [7] During the CMCC of January 16, 2013, the parties requested that the Tribunal issue a consent order on the basis of the draft confidentiality order agreed upon by the Respondent and the Complainant. Paragraph 18 of the Federal Court decision Uppal v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), [1987] 3 F.C. 565 summarizes clearly the scope and purpose of a consent order:\nA consent judgment has no precedential value. Generally speaking, a Court granting a consent judgment is concerned with only two things: the capacity of the parties to agree and its jurisdiction to make the order they have agreed to ask it to make. A consent judgment reflects neither findings of fact nor a considered application of the law to the facts by the Court. It is an exercise in a different fashion of the Court's basic function to resolve disputes: by giving effect to a settlement agreed to by legally competent persons rather than by reaching a concluded opinion itself.\n[8] In the present case, although the Complainant and Respondent have agreed on the proposed draft, the Commission has not. Section 51 of the Act delineates the Commission\u2019s role in cases before the Tribunal.\n51. In appearing at a hearing, presenting evidence and making representations, the Commission shall adopt such position as, in its opinion, is in the public interest having regard to the nature of the complaint\n[9] While the section does not explicitly state that the Commission is a \u201cparty to the proceedings\u201d, this is undoubtedly the case. This finding was made expressly by the Federal Court in Canadian Museum of Civilization Corp. v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, Local 70396, 2006 FC 703 at paragraphs 29, 51 and 55. In light of the Commission\u2019s opposition to the agreement brought forward by the parties, the agreement cannot be said to have been made on consent of all the parties. It is therefore not possible for the Tribunal to issue a consent order in these circumstances.\n[10] Pursuant to section 52 of the Act, the Tribunal has the ability to make any order it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry. Section 52 reads as follows:\n52. (1) An inquiry shall be conducted in public, but the member or panel conducting the inquiry may, on application, take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry if the member or panel is satisfied, during the inquiry or as a result of the inquiry being conducted in public, that\n(a) there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed;\n(b) there is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public;\n(c) there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public; or\n(d) there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered.\n(2) If the member or panel considers it appropriate, the member or panel may take any measures and make any order that the member or panel considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of a hearing held in respect of an application under subsection (1).\n[11] The Respondent argues that many of the documents subject to disclosure in this case, a case which in its essence, deals with the availability of proprietary technology not accessible to the public, contain confidential, private and sensitive commercial information. In addition, the Respondent alleges that it is itself subject to a number of confidentiality undertakings vis \u00e0 vis third parties regarding this information. Should this information be publicly disclosed in the course of these proceedings, the Respondent would be in breach of these undertakings and open itself to potential liability towards third parties. Framed under section 52(1)(c) of the Act, I understand the Respondent\u2019s argument to be that the disclosure of this information would cause undue hardship which outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public.\n[12] While I understand the Commission\u2019s position that the Tribunal can more appropriately address these confidentiality concerns as they arise in the course of the hearing, I am of the view that delineating the manner in which documents may be designated as confidential in an order will help the smooth progression of the proceedings. As the Tribunal seldom encounters cases involving proprietary confidential information, the CRTC Rules of Practice and Procedure (SOR\/2010\/277), the Broadcasting and Telecom Information Bulletin CRTC 2010-959, Guidelines on the CRTC Rules of Practice and Procedure and the Broadcasting and Telecom Information Bulletin CRTC 2010-961, Procedures for filing confidential information and requesting its disclosure in Commission proceedings have been of notable use in this regard. The Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence dealing with the adoption of confidentiality measures to ensure the protection of medical records is also worth noting (see, for example, the confidentiality measures adopted in Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2013 CHRT 1). Having examined the parties\u2019 submissions, the draft order, CHRT caselaw and the CRTC Rules of Procedure mentioned above, the Tribunal adopts the following Confidentiality Guidelines.\n1. Filing information that is designated as confidential\n[13] To file confidential information before the Tribunal, parties must follow the following steps:\ni. First, the party wishing to file the confidential information must file the information with the Tribunal and designate it as confidential;\nii. Second, another party or the Tribunal can request that the information be disclosed and the party who designated the information as confidential can reply to this request; and\niii. Third, based on the request to disclose and the party\u2019s reply, the Tribunal will determine whether it will disclose the information or require it to be disclosed.\n[14] A party filing information can \u201cdesignate\u201d it as confidential at the time it is filed with the Tribunal if it falls into one of the following categories:\ni. Information that is a trade secret;\nii. Financial, commercial, scientific or technical information that is confidential and that is treated consistently in a confidential manner by the person who submitted it; or\niii. Information the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected\n1. To result in material financial loss or gain to any person;\n2. To prejudice the competitive position of any person; or\n3. To affect contractual or other negotiations of any person.\n[15] At the time the party files information it designates as confidential, it must provide an abridged version of the document along with an explanation of how the information falls into a category of information listed above. The party must provide a detailed rationale to explain why the disclosure of the information is not in the public interest. The abridged version of the document and the reasons for the designation of information as confidential will be placed on the public record of the proceeding.\n[16] Documents containing information designated as confidential shall be filed separately and clearly marked as confidential. Documents designated confidential shall be disclosed to the Complainant, the Respondent, their counsel, and Commission counsel only and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal. A party who wishes to discuss a document or information that has been designated as confidential during the hearing shall advise of its intent to the Tribunal at which point the Tribunal will decide whether or not to exercise its discretion pursuant to section 52 of the Act and conduct this discussion in camera.\n[17] Confidential documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry. Confidential designation of documents made by the Tribunal continues in effect until the Tribunal orders otherwise, including for the duration of any judicial review and\/or appeal of the proceedings and after final judgment.\n[18] Parties, with the exception of the Commission, must return confidential documents to the party who disclosed them at the final disposition of this matter, once all judicial recourses have been exhausted. The Commission, as a government institution, will preserve the confidential nature of the documents in conformance with applicable governmental policies and directives on the conservation and safeguard of confidential proprietary information. Confidential documents in the Tribunal\u2019s possession will be sealed in accordance with Tribunal practice.\n2. Requesting disclosure of information designated as confidential\n[19] If one of the parties believes that the designated information should be made public pursuant to the test for disclosure, the following process must be followed:\ni. The party must file its request with the Tribunal and serve the person who designated the information as confidential. The request must explain why the party believes it would be in the public interest to disclose the information.\nii. The party who filed the designated information can file a reply with the Tribunal within 10 days, serving any party who requested disclosure of the designated information.\n3. Determination whether information designated as confidential will be disclosed\n[20] The Tribunal may disclose or require the disclosure of information designated as confidential if:\ni. It does not properly fall within one of the categories of information that can be designated confidential; or\nii. It was properly designated confidential but disclosure is in the public interest.\n[21] Where the Tribunal has determined that information should be disclosed, the party may be required to file a revised abridged version. The party must file the revised document within the time limit established by the Tribunal.\n[22] These guidelines do not apply to:\ni. Information which was lawfully or without legal restriction in the possession of any of the parties prior to the date of this Order;\nii. Information derived independently of disclosure hereunder;\niii. Information lawfully obtained from a person having a right to disclose such information; nor\niv. Information that becomes publicly available through means other than a breach of this Order.\n[23] The Tribunal reserves the right to amend these Guidelines as needed in the course of these proceedings.\nIV. Direction on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Oral Hearing on Motion on Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction [24] During the January 16th CMCC, the Tribunal indicated that it would be providing parties with a direction regarding the Respondent\u2019s request that its preliminary motion, challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, be heard in an oral hearing. However, since parties\u2019 written submissions on the motion will have all been submitted to the Tribunal by March 8, 2013, the Tribunal will wait until it has received the written submissions before deciding on the necessity to hold on oral hearing.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

H-6 [the Act], the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Right Tribunal (the Tribunal) institute an inquiry into the complaint of Harjinder Kaur Rai (the Complainant) against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the RCMP or the Respondent). The complaint alleges discrimination on the basis of sex and disability, pursuant to sections 7, 10 and 14 of the Act.\n[2] The following ruling is with regard to a request from the Respondent for the disclosure of documents from the Complainant.\nI. Background [3] Among other things, the Complainant alleges the Respondent failed to mitigate or avoid the effects of harassment and discrimination on her. In this regard, she has placed at issue in this complaint her mental health related to depression and anxiety and its causation.\n[4] On January 24, 2013, the Respondent requested the disclosure of two main types of documents from the Complainant: medical documents and documents from her personal injury action related to her 2007 motor vehicle accident.\nII. Positions of the Parties A. Medical document from April 1, 2007 to present [5] According to the Respondent, the Complainant has alleged harassment, which began in 2000 and caused her to suffer health problems. However, the Respondent claims the medical documentation disclosed and produced from the Complainant begins only in 2009.\n[6] The Respondent wishes to explore whether there are other health issues that undermined her mental state in the circumstances giving rise to her complaint. Specifically, on April 1, 2007, the Complainant was in a motor vehicle accident. She took six weeks off work to recover from this accident. According to the Respondent, this accident seems to have been the beginning of the Complainant\u2019s physical and emotional difficulties.\n[7] The Respondent submits that the documents the Complainant has already produced demonstrate that her chronic pain diagnosis from her motor vehicle accident has a psychological component. According to the Respondent, Dr. Badii, the Complainant\u2019s medical expert from her 2008 accident claim, outlined that the Complainant\u2019s failure to recover from her soft tissue injuries and her development of chronic pain was related to her pre-existing risk factors (female sex, history of stress and depression). The Respondent claims the doctor recommended that she see a \u201cpsychiatrist or psychologist to explore whether the MVA-associated physical injuries and psychiatric symptoms have in any way influenced her ability to deal with conflict issues at work, and thus had a negative impact on her readiness to return to work from a psychiatric perspective\u201d.\n[8] The Respondent also seeks disclosure of the portions of Dr. Bredenkamp\u2019s file, her family physician, that were provided to them in redacted form. According to the Respondent, the redactions consist of 18 blank pages, rather than redacted lines within chart pages. It is the Respondent\u2019s position that Dr. Bredenkamp\u2019s entire file is relevant.\n[9] By way of clarification, the Complainant submits she does not claim that she did not suffer psychological issues until 2008. Instead, she asserts that she did not seek treatment for psychological issues until 2008. In this regard, she claims to have disclosed the records of Drs. Sanders and Babbage, psychiatrists, and Dr. Flamer, psychologist. While the Respondent has also requested the records of Dr. Ratheberger, psychologist, the Complainant claims to have made efforts to obtain those records from the doctor, who has confirmed to the Complainant\u2019s counsel that no such records exist. The Respondent also requested the records of Dr. Nemetz, psychologist. However, the Complainant does not recall visiting this doctor and does not have any of his records in her possession.\n[10] With respect to her medical condition following the 2008 motor vehicle accident, the Complainant claims to have disclosed the portions of her family physician\u2019s medical file related to the soft-tissue injuries and chronic pain she developed following the accident. The Complainant also claims to have disclosed the medical files and\/or opinions of those care providers who made notations regarding her mental health, which were in her possession.\n[11] The Complainant submits the Respondent has failed to justify why it requires medical documents about other areas of the Complainant\u2019s health. Furthermore, the Complainant asserts there is no suggestion in either party\u2019s Statement of Particulars that any medical evidence predating October 25, 2008 is relevant to this complaint. According to the Complainant, she has not placed in issue her entire medical history; only her mental health conditions related to depression and anxiety and their causation. She claims the Respondent has failed to provide any rationale for its request for documents prior to the motor vehicle accident, other than its bare assertion that the date \u201cseems to have been the beginning of Cpl. Rai\u2019s physical and emotional difficulties\u201d.\n[12] The Commission agrees that the Complainant\u2019s depression and anxiety are at issue in this matter and, as such, the Respondent is entitled to all arguably relevant documents related to those issues. That said, the Commission adds that the Respondent is only entitled to documents related to the medical conditions at issue and not all of the Complainant\u2019s medical files.\nB. Redacted psychiatrist\/psychologist files [13] The Complainant has disclosed and produced to the Respondent redacted copies of the medical files of Drs. Sanders, Babbage and Flamer, her psychiatrists\/psychologists. In the Respondent\u2019s view, as the Complainant has placed her mental health at issue in her complaint, it is entitled to the entire medical chart of each of these doctors.\n[14] The Complainant submits that during and as part of treatment she had discussions with her psychiatrists\/psychologists about the instant proceedings that are subject to litigation privilege. These discussions are noted in the doctors\u2019 files and, therefore, have been redacted. According to the Complainant, disclosure of these discussions would cause her significant prejudice and would undermine the doctor-patient relationship, legal process and the fairness of these proceedings.\n[15] The Respondent submits that litigation privilege covers the work product of the lawyer and for a document to be covered by litigation privilege, it must have been created in contemplation of litigation or for use in the litigation. In the Respondent\u2019s view, a doctor\u2019s chart could not have been created in contemplation of, or for use in, litigation. Therefore, the Complainant\u2019s claim of litigation privilege as a basis for redacting information from the medical files is incorrect; therefore, the entire chart of each of her psychiatrists\/psychologists should be produced.\nC. Documents related to personal injury action [16] The Respondent claims the Complainant has produced a \u201cheavily redacted\u201d copy of the Complainant\u2019s examination for discovery transcript from her personal injury action regarding her 2008 motor vehicle accident. It requests the complete transcript. The Respondent also requests the Complainant\u2019s list of documents created for that personal injury action and any documentation substantiating her claim for damages in that action, including loss of past and future earning capacity.\n[17] According to the Respondent, while the Complainant alleges harassment that began in 2000, she reported no depression and had no issues at work until her 2008 motor vehicle accident. After the accident, she was unable to work and was diagnosed with depression and chronic pain syndrome. She took almost a year off work to recuperate and has never fully returned to duty. Until her accident, the Respondent claims the Complainant worked full time and was on a normal career path for an RCMP member.\n[18] Following the Complainant\u2019s motor vehicle accident, she filed a claim for personal injury damages to compensate her for loss of enjoyment of life, lost wages and loss of opportunity. As the current complaint alleges that discrimination caused the Complainant to suffer depression and caused her career to stall, the Respondent submits there is an overlap between the allegations in her complaint and her motor vehicle claim. According to the Respondent, the full effect of the accident must be explored to ensure that the Respondent\u2019s right to a fair hearing is respected.\n[19] The Complainant submits that the information produced under compulsion of the Rules of Court, including examination for discovery and lists of documents, is subject to an implied undertaking, owed to the Court, which prevents a party from relying on that information in subsequent proceedings without leave of the Court.\n[20] The Commission agrees that documents related to the Complainant\u2019s action following her motor vehicle accident in 2008 are not subject to disclosure because of the implied rule of confidentiality. The Commission adds that despite the fact that the requested documents are confidential, the Respondent is already in possession of portions of the Complainant\u2019s discovery transcript. According to the Commission, this addresses any concerns related to double recovery in this case.\n[21] The Complainant also submits that a list of documents prepared for another proceeding is not relevant for the purposes of this proceeding. While the Respondent may believe there are documents listed therein that are in some way relevant to the current complaint, according to the Complainant, this is indicative that the Respondent is embarking upon a fishing expedition.\n[22] The Complainant adds that the claims for damages in her personal injury action do not overlap with those made in the current complaint. According to the Complainant, she has disclosed all portions of her discovery transcript which relate to her injuries, including where she states that she does not believe that she suffered depression and anxiety as a result of the accident. The Complainant claims that the defendant from the motor vehicle action would not have agreed to compensate her for damages to her mental state in the face of this admission.\n[23] As for lost wages, the Complainant contends that she has limited her claim in this matter to losses that exclude the period following her motor vehicle accident, which is addressed in her personal injury action, so as to avoid double recovery. She claims to have disclosed all portions of her discovery transcript, which relate to her claims for lost wages, and that she has also disclosed medical reports that set out a period of time beyond which the authors conclude her injuries no longer relate to the motor vehicle accident. The Complainant has also retained an expert to make a calculation as to lost wages for the purposes of this complaint. In making those calculations, the Complainant asked the expert to exclude the period of October 24, 2008 to July 6, 2009, that being the period during which the Complainant was off duty as a result of her motor vehicle accident.\n[24] The Respondent states that the Complainant has misunderstood what loss of past and future earning capacity compensates. According to the Respondent, where a loss of earning capacity is awarded, compensation is awarded for loss of earning capacity over the course of the plaintiff\u2019s lifetime. Therefore, excluding any claim for lost wages from October 2008 to July 2009 does not eliminate the possibility of double recovery in this case.\nD. Settlement agreement from personal injury action [25] The Respondent also requests the signed release that discontinued the Complainant\u2019s personal injury action following her 2008 motor vehicle accident. The Respondent submits that the release will inform the Tribunal of the amount the Complainant was compensated by her tortfeasors in her accident claim and, therefore, will avoid the potential for double recovery. Without the release, the Respondent claims that there is no way of determining what compensation the Complainant has already received for loss of earning capacity, and lost past and future income.\n[26] According to the Complainant, the settlement documents from her personal injury action are covered by settlement privilege. The Complainant submits that she cannot waive settlement privilege without the consent of the other party to the lawsuit, as settlement privilege belongs to both parties to the settlement. The Complainant adds that the Respondent has failed to make any submissions as to why there is an overriding public interest in disclosure in this case.\n[27] While the Respondent agrees that privilege exists to protect settlement communications, it points out that there are exceptions to this rule. In particular, there is an exception where settlement documents are necessary to determine if a Plaintiff has already been compensated for loss of earning capacity and lost earnings.\nIII. Ruling [28] Pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the Act, parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. Therefore, for fairness reasons and in the search for truth, it is in the public interest to ensure that all arguably relevant evidence is disclosed between the parties appearing before the Tribunal. If there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues, or forms of relief identified by the parties, it should be disclosed pursuant to paragraphs 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) [the Rules] (see Guay v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2004 CHRT 34, at para. 42 [Guay]; and Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. v. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 CHRT 28, at para. 4).\n[29] With these principles in mind, the following is the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the Respondent\u2019s request for the disclosure of documents.\nA. Medical document from April 1, 2007 to present [30] With regard to medical records, the Tribunal has recognized that a complainant has a right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to medical records (see Beaudry v. Canada (Attorney General), 2002 CanLII 45930 (CHRT), at para. 7 [Beaudry]; McAvinn v. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd., 2001 CanLII 25855 (CHRT), at para. 3 [McAvinn]). However, that right to privacy and confidentiality may cease when that person puts his or her health in issue (see McAvinn at para. 4; Guay at para. 45; Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada and Femmes-Action v. Bell Canada, 2005 CHRT 9, at paras. 9-11; see also Frenette v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., [1992] 1 SCR 647 [Frenette]; and, M. (A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 SCR 157). That said, \u201cthe need to get at the truth and avoid injustice does not automatically negate the possibility of protection from full disclosure\u201d (M. (A.) at para. 33). In cases where the Tribunal has ordered the disclosure of medical records, it has usually put conditions on the disclosure to protect the privacy and confidentiality of the information (see for example Guay; McAvinn; Beaudry; and Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2012 CHRT 11).\n[31] The Complainant has put in issue her mental health related to depression and anxiety. Therefore, pursuant to the principles outlined above, any arguably relevant medical documents related to these conditions should be disclosed to the Respondent. The Complainant has also put in issue the causation of her depression and anxiety. Based on the Respondent\u2019s submissions, I am satisfied that there is a possibility that the Complainant\u2019s physical injuries following her motor vehicle accident may have had an effect on her mental health. Therefore, any arguably relevant medical documents related to the treatment of the Complainant\u2019s physical injuries following her motor vehicle accident should also be disclosed to the Respondent. Any medical documents about other areas of the Complainant\u2019s health that are not mentioned above are not in issue in this case and are not relevant for the purposes of disclosure.\n[32] Based on the Respondent\u2019s submissions, I also find the request for medical documents from April 1, 2007, that being the date of the Complainant\u2019s motor vehicle accident, to be reasonable. I am satisfied that the Respondent\u2019s request in this regard is not in the nature of a fishing expedition, as it is based upon documents already disclosed to it from the Complainant. If the Complainant\u2019s motor vehicle accident has had an effect on her mental health, its relation to the allegations made in the present complaint need be examined in order to provide the Respondent with a full and ample opportunity to present its case. The disclosure of these arguably relevant documents will also ensure that the Tribunal has all relevant evidence before it and may assist it in crafting an appropriate remedy should the complaint be substantiated.\n[33] The Complainant argues that the Tribunal\u2019s Rules only require her to disclose documents in her \u201cpossession\u201d and are silent about documents within a party\u2019s \u201ccontrol\u201d. As the medical records requested by the Respondent are not in the Complainant\u2019s possession, she submits there is no obligation to list, obtain and disclosed such documents.\n[34] However, Rule 1(2) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules states that they are to be \u201c\u2026liberally applied by each Panel to the case before it so as to advance the purposes set out in 1(1)\u201d. Among other things, the purpose of the Rules is to ensure that: \u201carguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner\u201d (Rule 1(1)(b)); and that \u201call proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible\u201d (Rule 1(1)(c)). I would add that Rule 1(1)(c) reflects subsection 48.9(1) of the Act.\n[35] In the circumstances of this case, having the Complainant obtain and disclose the arguably relevant medical documents will ensure that the purpose of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules is advanced. It is the Complainant who has the right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to her medical records. Barring a subpoena and holding a hearing, it is only the Complainant who has the power to obtain these records. Therefore, ordering the Complainant to obtain and disclose her medical document is the most informal, timely and efficient manner of retrieving any of these arguably relevant documents. Aside from the potential cost of having to obtain these records, there does not seem to be any prejudice to the Complainant in proceeding in this manner.\n[36] Therefore, the Complainant is ordered to disclose any medical documents from April 1, 2007 to present that relate to symptoms of or treatment for depression and anxiety and treatment of physical injuries related to her motor vehicle accident. In satisfying this order, the Complainant should also disclose any arguably relevant documents identified by the Respondent in Schedule A of its January 24, 2013 request for disclosure or confirm that they do not exist.\n[37] To protect the Complainant's right to confidentiality of her medical records, the documents shall be disclosed to counsel for the Respondent and the Commission, and shall not be disclosed to any other individuals without prior permission from the Tribunal and notification to the Complainant. Additionally, the documents may not be used for any purpose outside of the present inquiry and the documents must be returned to the Complainant at the conclusion of the inquiry.\n[38] It should be noted that this ruling relates only to the question of the disclosure of medical documents. Any question regarding the admissibility of these documents into evidence can be addressed at the hearing of this case.\nB. Redacted psychiatrist\/psychologist files [39] Litigation privilege \u201c\u2026relates to information and materials gathered or created in the litigation context\u201d (Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2009 FC 1221, at para. 37 [Blank FC]). It contemplates communications between \u201c\u2026a solicitor and third parties or, in the case of an unrepresented litigant, between the litigant and third parties\u201d (Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2006 SCC 39, at para. 27 [Blank SCC]). The test to determine whether litigation privilege should attach to a document needs to satisfy the following critera: \u201c\u20261) it is a communication; 2) prepared or obtained; 3) for the \"dominant purpose\" of reasonably anticipated litigation\u201d (Blank FC, at para. 37; see also Blank SCC, at paras. 59-60).\n[40] Without more information regarding the redacted communications between the Complainant and her psychiatrists\/psychologists, it is not possible for the Tribunal to determine their \u201cdominant purpose\u201d. Affidavit evidence setting out the factual basis of the privilege claim and\/or allowing the Tribunal to view the documents (whether by the current Member or another Member) would be an appropriate procedure for ascertaining whether privilege applies (see M. (A.), at para. 39). In this regard, I would like to get the parties\u2019 views on proceeding in this manner. The Complainant is to provide submissions on this issue by April 5, 2013. A response from the Respondent and the Commission is requested by April 19, 2013. Any reply from the Complainant can be provided by April 26, 2013.\nC. Documents related to personal injury action [41] According to the Supreme Court of Canada, \u201cthe law imposes on the parties to civil litigation an undertaking to the court not to use the documents or answers disclosed during discovery for any purposes other than securing justice in the civil proceedings in which the answers were compelled\u2026\u201d (Juman v. Doucette, 2008 SCC 8, at para. 27 [Juman]. As the Tribunal stated in Bignell-Malcolm v. Ebb and Flow Indian Band, 2008 CHRT 3, at para. 24:\nThis principle of confidence protects individual privacy interests and preserves the integrity of the process of civil litigation as without this protection of privacy, parties to a law suit might fail to make complete disclosure of all of the facts relevant to a law suit.\n[42] However, the implied undertaking may be trumped by a more compelling public interest (see Juman, at para. 30). Examples of such public interest include statutory exceptions (see Juman, at para. 39); public safety concerns (see Juman, at para. 40); impeaching inconsistent testimony (see Juman, at para. 41); or, the prevention of certain crimes (see Juman, at paras. 42-50). Overall, in order to relieve against an implied undertaking, there must exist \u201c\u2026a public interest of greater weight than the values the implied undertaking is designed to protect, namely privacy and the efficient conduct of civil litigation\u201d (Juman, at para. 32). However, the Supreme Court cautioned that \u201c\u2026unless an examinee is satisfied that the undertaking will only be modified or varied by the court in exceptional circumstances, the undertaking will not achieve its intended purpose\u201d (Juman, at para. 32).\n[43] I am not convinced that there is a public interest of greater weight in this case that trumps the implied undertaking. While the Respondent is concerned with the potential for double recovery, the discovery transcript, list of documents and any documentation substantiating her claim for damages in her personal injury action will not assist in this regard. As the action was settled, only the settlement agreement can specify the actual amount received by the Complainant in compensation for dropping her personal injury action. The Respondent has also requested the disclosure of the settlement agreement, which is discussed below.\n[44] The Respondent also claimed that it may use the discovery transcript to impeach the Complainant at the hearing of this matter. This bare assertion, without something more specific, also does not convince me to trump the public interest of the implied undertaking rule.\n[45] Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s request for documents related to the Complainant\u2019s personal injury action is denied.\nD. Settlement agreement from personal injury action [46] Settlement agreements may be privileged and\/or confidential (see Groupe d'aide et d'information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec inc. v. Barbe, 2003 CHRT 15; Leslie Palm v. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 and Cliff Willicome and Richard Wilkinson, 2011 CHRT 12; and Dos Santos v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 2005 BCCA 4). Prior to ruling on the request for disclose of the settlement agreement, and in order to ensure that the Tribunal makes a fully informed decision in this regard, it would be helpful to receive submissions from the other party to the settlement agreement. Therefore, the Complainant is ordered to provide the Tribunal with the name and contact information of the defendant in her personal injury action resulting from her motor vehicle accident. The Tribunal will then contact this person and solicit his\/her views on this issue, and will give an opportunity for each party to respond. The Complaint is asked to provide the necessary information by April 5, 2013.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 20, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1795\/2512\nStyle of Cause: Harjinder Kaur Rai v.

Background. 1\nII........... Analysis. 4\nThe Statutory Scheme. 5\nThe Correspondence from the Acting Chief Commissioner 5\nThe Determinative Nature of the Chairperson Letter 7\n[1] On July 18, 2009, Mr. Premakumar Kanagasabapathy (the \u201ccomplainant\u201d) filed a complaint against Air Canada (the \u201crespondent\u201d) under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d). The complainant alleged therein that, in the context of his employment, the respondent had denied him promotional opportunities as a form of \u201creprisal\u201d, and that it had treated him differently on the grounds of race, colour and national or ethnic origin. On January 11, 2012, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Act, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) requested that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) institute an inquiry in respect of the complaint, the exact scope of which is the subject of the present motion brought by the respondent.\n[2] The motion seeks an order striking out a number of paragraphs of the Statements of Particulars filed by the Commission and the complainant.\nI. Background [3] Pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (the \u201cRules\u201d), each party is to serve and file a Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) setting out, among other things,\n(a) the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case; (b) its position on the legal issues raised by the case. The Commission\u2019s SOP was provided on August 30, 2012. The complainant\u2019s SOP was provided on September 13, 2012.\n[4] On September 28, 2012, the respondent brought the present motion to strike certain paragraphs of the two SOP\u2019s, on the grounds that the paragraphs in question make reference to parts of the original complaint that were not referred for inquiry to the Tribunal, namely:\n\u2022 allegations that the complainant failed to receive job promotions\n\u2022 allegations that the complainant was the subject of retaliation\n[5] It argues that, prior to referral, the Commission investigator grouped the allegations comprising the complaint into three distinct parts:\nPart (i): Allegations related to a failure to receive job promotions;\nPart (ii): Allegations related to retaliation;\nPart (iii): Allegations of adverse differential treatment, particularly with respect to the Complainant not being returned to the temporary position of a cabin planner.\n[6] The Commission\u2019s investigation report (\u201cIR\u201d) concluded that there was no evidence to support allegations of discrimination in respect of Parts (i) and (ii) of the complaint. Subsequently, the respondent argues, the IR recommended that only the allegations of\nPart (iii)\u2014\u201ccabin planner position\u201d\u2014warranted a Tribunal inquiry, and that the Commission only referred this part of the complaint to the Tribunal. The first and second parts of the complaint were not referred for inquiry; as such they are outside the scope of the referral and the paragraphs of the SOPs which deal with them should therefore be struck. The respondent affirms that striking these paragraphs will simplify the inquiry process and allow the Tribunal to focus on the part of the complaint that is genuinely before it.\n[7] In support of its argument the Respondent relies on a letter dated January 11, 2012, which it received from the Acting Chief Commissioner (the \u201cAir Canada letter\u201d), indicating that the complaint is being sent for inquiry because the respondent\u2019s decision not to return the complainant to the cabin planner position may have been discriminatory. This demonstrates, in the respondent\u2019s view, that the referral for inquiry was based on the \u201cPart (iii)\u201d allegations.\n[8] The Commission opposes the Respondent\u2019s motion. The Commission submits that the entire complaint was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, not just portions of it. The Commission denies that it ever decided to dismiss portions of the complaint, or that it communicated such a decision to the parties. In this regard, it disputes the respondent\u2019s interpretation of the Air Canada letter. Furthermore, it relies on another letter sent by the Acting Chief Commissioner on January 11, 2012\u2014this one addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal\u2014requesting that an inquiry be instituted (\u201cthe Chairperson letter\u201d). The Chairperson letter simply requests \u201can inquiry into the complaint\u201d, without mentioning allegations about the cabin planner position, or any other allegations.\n[9] The Commission asserts that the present motion is in essence a collateral attack on the Commission\u2019s decision-making process, and that the respondent is improperly asking the Tribunal to conduct a review thereof. In this regard, the Commission affirms that the Tribunal has no supervisory jurisdiction over the Commission. As for the findings of the IR, the Commission argues that they are in no way binding upon the Tribunal.\n[10] The complainant asserts that the entire complaint has been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry; it has not been truncated or divided into sections. In particular, the complainant argues that the cabin planner allegation is interwoven with the retaliation allegations. If the Tribunal were to limit the scope of the complaint as per the order sought, the complainant would suffer prejudice, since the narrative in support of his case would be undermined. The complainant submits that if there is any ambiguity in the meaning of the referral letter, that ambiguity ought to be resolved in favour the complainant, by allowing the particulars he has sought to advance. Moreover, he advances the premise that inquiries before the Tribunal proceed without reliance on the Commission\u2019s IR and\/or the reasons for referring the complaint.\n[11] In reply, the respondent argues that the recommendations in the IR and the representations of the parties with respect to the report are necessary matter for the Commission\u2019s decision. In particular, the Commission\u2019s reasons for decision can be found in the IR itself; it is the only document referred to in the Act as the basis for a Commission decision on how to proceed. Moreover, the Air Canada letter reproduced verbatim the recommendations of the IR, demonstrating that the Commission essentially accepted all of its conclusions, including the screening out of Parts (i) and (ii) of the complaint. The respondent invokes previous cases where the Tribunal did not rely exclusively on the strict wording of the Commission\u2019s referral decision in order to determine the scope of the referral. It also notes that the wording of the Air Canada letter is significantly different from that of the Chairperson letter. The wording of the former militates in favour of a contextual approach in order to determine the extent of the referral.\n[12] The respondent asserts that the complainant is able to advance his case in respect of Part (iii) of the complaint (failure to place him in the cabin planner position) without relying on the allegations contained in Part (i) (failure to receive job promotions) or Part (ii) (retaliation). It also asserts that judicial economy would be better served if the Tribunal\u2019s resources would not be spent on allegations that were identified as being unsupported by the evidence and not warranting further inquiry.\n[13] In the respondent\u2019s submission, a contextual approach to determining the scope of the referral requires consideration of the complaint, the IR and the decision of the Commission. The Chairperson letter is not a decision and was not communicated to the parties. This letter amounts to no more than an administrative transferring of the file to the Tribunal; to hold the Tribunal to the letter\u2019s content disregards the content of the Commission\u2019s decision that was communicated to the parties.\n[14] On December 18, 2012, in an addendum to its reply submissions, the respondent makes reference to correspondence sent by the complainant to the Commission prior to the referral, apparently agreeing with the conclusions in the IR that the allegations of Part (i) and Part (ii) did not merit an inquiry. The respondent asserts that it relied on these representations from the complainant.\n[15] On January 7, 2013, in answer to the reply addendum, the complainant acknowledges that the correspondence in question did not challenge the IR. But he submits that this correspondence was not binding on the Commission in the exercise of its discretion. He further argues that no estoppel was created so as to prohibit him from arguing for a broader interpretation of the referral letter before the Tribunal. Finally, he observes that without access to the entire record that was before the Commission, one cannot know the impact the correspondence had on the Commission\u2019s decision to refer the case.\nII. Analysis [16] The present motion requires the Tribunal to ascertain the scope of the referral before it. Before addressing the particular facts of this case, a number of general observations are in order.\nThe Statutory Scheme [17] Under the CHRA, the Commission may designate an investigator to investigate a complaint. An investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of the investigation, submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation, the aforementioned \u201cIR\u201d (ss. 43(1), 44(1)).\n[18] Under s. 44, upon receipt of the IR, the Commission is empowered to take a number of different dispositive actions\u2014and it must notify in writing the parties to the complaint of the dispositive action it has chosen. Pursuant to s. 44(3), if it is satisfied that the complaint should not be referred to another authority, or dismissed on the ground that it is untimely, beyond its jurisdiction, trivial, vexatious, or made in bad faith, the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint under s. 49.\n[19] Section 49(1) specifies that such requests can be made to the Chairperson if the Commission is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted. It is noteworthy that s. 49 requests can be made any time after the filing of a complaint.\nThe Correspondence from the Acting Chief Commissioner [20] This motion boils down to an alleged inconsistency between two letters, signed the same day, by the Acting Chief Commissioner.\n[21] The \u201cChairperson letter\u201d purports to be a physical manifestation of a s. 49 request, emanating from the Acting Chief Commissioner, and addressed to the then CHRT Chairperson. It is fairly succinct, informing the Chairperson that the Commission has reviewed the complaint, and then stating:\n\u201cThe Commission has decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the complaint as it is satisfied that, having regard to all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\n[22] Notably absent from the \u201cChairperson letter\u201d is any reference to the component allegations of the complaint, the recommendations of the investigator, or any finding or detail of the IR.\n[23] The \u201cAir Canada letter\u201d is quite different. The Air Canada letter is of course addressed to the respondent, but beyond that, it is also considerably more detailed.\n[24] It begins by explaining that before rendering its decision, the Commission reviewed \u201c...the report disclosed to you previously...\u201d (presumably the IR), as well as any submissions filed in response thereto. It goes on to explain why the complaint was not dismissed for untimeliness. Then comes the key paragraph:\n\u201cIt is further recommended, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, that the Commission request that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint because:\n\u25aa credibility is an issue and as the investigator is unable to assess credibility, further inquiry is warranted; and\n\u25aa the respondent\u2019s decision not to return the complainant to the Cabin Planner position because of a performance issue may have been used as a pretext not to return the complainant to the position because of his race and national or ethnic origin.\u201d\n[25] This paragraph has attracted the respondent\u2019s attention, because it singles out one of the constituent allegations in the complaint: the Part (iii) portion. Moreover, the paragraph fairly closely tracks the recommendation contained in the IR\u2014the same IR that apparently found the allegations of Part (i) and Part (ii) to be unsupported by the evidence.\n[26] However, in spite of its differences, the \u201cAir Canada letter\u201d shares some important similarities with the \u201cChairperson letter\u201d:\n\u2022 neither letter says that any portion of the complaint has been dismissed;\n\u2022 neither letter says that an inquiry is being requested into a portion of the complaint.\n[27] In spite of these characteristics, the respondent sees in the Air Canada letter, a clear indication from the Commission that \u201c...the complaint, in its entirety was not referred to the Tribunal...\u201d Rather, in the respondent\u2019s view, an inquiry was only sought in respect of the\nPart (iii) portion (failure to return the complainant to the cabin planner position).\n[28] For the reasons that follow, I cannot accept the respondent\u2019s arguments and would dismiss the motion.\nThe Determinative Nature of the Chairperson Letter [29] In my view, given the wording of s. 49(1), the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of the Commission\u2019s request to the Chairperson for an inquiry is this: the letter sent from the Commission to the Chairperson requesting an inquiry. In the present case, the letter of request was signed by the Acting Chief Commissioner, but most importantly, it is addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal. This is the document which initiates the entire Tribunal inquiry process. Accordingly, this is the document that determines whether the complaint has been referred in its entirety or not.\n[30] It was open to the Commission to request an inquiry in respect of only a portion of the complaint. As the respondent points out, it was held in the Northwest Territories case that the Commission has jurisdiction to refer two constituent allegations of a complaint before a tribunal while continuing to investigate a third (Northwest Territories v. P.S.A.C. (1999) 162 F.T.R. 50)). However, I believe that if, in the present matter, the Commission had intended to request an inquiry into something less than the entirety of the complaint, this intention would have been manifest in the letter of request it sent to the Chairperson. As an example, in the decision of Johnston v. Canadian Armed Forces 2007 CHRT 42, para. 6, one reads that:\n\u201cOn June 11, 2003, the Commission notified the Tribunal Chairperson that it was only referring the s. 10 aspect of the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry, having decided that the s. 7 component of the complaint should be dismissed\u2026\u201d\n[31] Similarly, the Court\u2019s judgment in Northwest Territories contains the observation that:\n\u201cThe Commission notified the GNWT by letter dated May 27, 1997 that it had decided, pursuant to section 49 of the Act, to request the President of the Panel to appoint a Tribunal to inquire into the sections 7 and 11 aspects of the complaint.\u201d\n[para.8 emphasis added]\n[32] There is no such qualifying language in the letter of request sent to the Chairperson in the current case. I therefore conclude that the complaint, in its entirety, was sent to the Chairperson for the institution of an inquiry, and that I was subsequently assigned to inquire into it, in its entirety.\n[33] Given the paramount significance I attach to the Chairperson letter, it follows that the contents of the Air Canada letter cannot supersede it.\n[34] Moreover, reliance on the Air Canada letter to justify an inquiry confined to a mere portion of the complaint is problematic for other reasons as well. The Air Canada letter is not addressed to the Chairperson of the Tribunal, or to any officer thereof. It would appear to be a written notification sent to the respondent pursuant to s. 44, informing it of the dispositive action taken under that provision. As such, it is an element of the Commission\u2019s complaint-handling machinery which is beyond the Tribunal\u2019s purview. As was recently confirmed by the Federal Court in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Warman, 2012 FC 1162 (appeal pending A\u2011456-12), at para. 56:\n\u201cIn particular, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the exercise of the Commission\u2019s discretion under CHRA s 44(3) (rejecting or referring a complaint) and s 47 (appointing a conciliator). The proper way to challenge a Commission decision in respect of such matters is through judicial review by the Federal Court.\u201d\n[35] A similar finding was made in respect of the Tribunal\u2019s ability to examine the Commission\u2019s decision-making under s. 41(1)(e) (See I.L.W.U. (Marine Section) Local 400 v. Oster, 2001 FCT 1115, para. 30.\n[36] The respondent invites the Tribunal to enmesh itself in the methodology of the investigation, the findings and recommendations of the investigator, the wording of the IR, and its apparent similarities with the subsequent letter sent to the respondent, notifying it of the Commission\u2019s decision. As I have mentioned, this is not permissible. But even if it were, the Tribunal is in no way bound by the IR or the views of the investigator. (see Bell Canada v. C.E.P.U. [1999] 1 F.C. 113, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1609 (QL) (C.A.), QL 37; P.S.A.C. (Local 70396 v. Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation 2006 CHRT 1, paras. 29-30 ; Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency 2012 CHRT 3, at paras.4-5).\n[37] On a certain level, the respondent\u2019s objection is understandable. It received a decision under s. 44 which it interpreted as having restricted the ambit of the request for an inquiry. Such interpretation, however, was not borne out by the Commission\u2019s action taken under s. 49. The respondent may reasonably ask why this is the case, especially given the findings of the IR, from which the wording of the Air Canada letter seems to be drawn. But the forum in which to ask that question is the Federal Court, in a judicial review application of the Commission\u2019s decision, and not the Tribunal. Even if one were to accept the respondent\u2019s contention that the Chairperson letter is not a decision per se, but a mere \u201cadministrative transferring\u201d, it is this letter of request addressed to the Chairperson that breathes life into the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in regard to a complaint.\n[38] The determinative nature of the Chairperson letter was recognized by the Tribunal in C\u00f4t\u00e9 v. A.G. Canada 2003 CHRT 32, paras. 12-13 where the Tribunal rejected the proposition that, due to the Commission\u2019s prior declared findings regarding the scope of the complaint, the Commission was no longer able to refer the entire complaint to the Tribunal. In C\u00f4t\u00e9, the Tribunal would not accept the respondent\u2019s invitation to \u201c...look behind the Commission\u2019s decision and review it in order to determine whether the Commission possessed the jurisdiction to make such a referral.\u201d Supervisory jurisdiction over the actions and decisions of the Commission, it was observed, falls within the exclusive purview of the Federal Court.\n[39] The respondent relies on the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics 2009 CHRT 22, as authority for the premise that the Tribunal can indeed look behind the Commission\u2019s letter of request to the Chairperson, in order to verify if in fact the entire complaint has been referred for inquiry. In Kowalski, because the Commission had made an express prior decision that certain aspects of the complaint \u201c...ought not to be considered further...\u201d, the Tribunal saw fit to depart from the approach in C\u00f4t\u00e9. It held that even though, on its face, the letter of request to the Chairperson referred the entire complaint, this document belied earlier correspondence to the parties, in which the Commission had communicated \u201cexplicit determinations\u201d not to deal with portions of the complaint.\n[40] I do not believe that the decision in Kowalski resolves the issue before me. First of all, I am respectfully of the view that Kowalski is not truly consistent with the approach established in C\u00f4t\u00e9; the same reasons that militated against the Tribunal\u2019s poring over the pre-referral record in C\u00f4t\u00e9 do not lose their potency in the context of pre-referral determinations made by the Commission in Kowalski. In each case, the Tribunal is being asked to \u201clook behind\u201d a clear request to the Chairperson for an inquiry, in search of ambiguities and contradictions in the Commission\u2019s pre-referral dealings with the complaint. Moreover, the exclusive supervisory jurisdiction of the Federal Court acknowledged in C\u00f4t\u00e9, would seem to be just as available in Kowalski to correct alleged discordance between the request for an inquiry and any \u201cexplicit determinations\u201d made previously.\n[41] If my assessment of Kowalski is held to be incorrect, I would add only that the facts of the case itself are distinguishable from those before me. Nothing in the record before me suggests that at any time, the Commission had decided, pursuant to a provision of the CHRA, that the allegations comprising Parts (i) and (ii) of the complaint \u201cought not to be considered further.\u201d (cf Kowalski, para. 3).\n[42] Finally, the Respondent, in its Addendum Reply Submissions, seeks to rely on yet another event taking place during the Commission phase of the complaint process. In his submissions made to the Commission in respect of the IR, the complainant apparently agreed that Parts (i) and (ii) of the complaint were without merit, which, in the respondent\u2019s view, amounted to a representation as to the scope of the complaint, upon which the respondent relied. For the reasons given above, I cannot consider it as a basis on which to second-guess the clear and unequivocal request sent to the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on January 11, 2012. If anything, this last submission by the respondent amply demonstrates the dangers of the approach it advocates, whereby the Tribunal is essentially asked to conduct a de facto certiorari proceeding in respect of the Commission\u2019s handling and disposition of the complaint. Neither the judicial economy objective invoked by the respondent, nor the expeditious inquiry mandated by Parliament is advanced by such an endeavour. More to the point, the Tribunal cannot exercise a supervisory jurisdiction it simply does not possess.\n[43] For all of the above reasons, the motion is dismissed.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 20, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1771\/0412\nStyle of Cause: Premakumar Kanagasabapathy v.

Introduction [1] On December 20, 2012, the respondent British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (BCMEA) filed a preliminary motion seeking dismissal of complaints of discrimination (the Complaints) made against it by the several longshore workers (the \u201cComplainants\u201d). In support of its application BCMEA tendered an Affidavit of Eleanor Marynuik, Vice President, Human Resources, BCMEA, sworn December 12, 2012 (the \u201cMarynuik Affidavit\u201d).\n[2] On January 16, 2013, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) filed a formal letter dated January 2, 2013, constituting its application for dismissal of the Complaints. ILWU\u2019s application is based on the facts in the Marynuik Affidavit.\n[3] On January 21, 2013, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCHRC\u201d) filed its brief seeking dismissal of the motion.\n[4] On January 23, 2013, ILWU filed a supplementary letter in response to the CHRC brief.\nII. Complaints [5] The Complaints allege age-based discrimination under sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) by reason of termination of their employment at age 65. Each of the complainants was mandatorily retired during the period May 1, 2009 to June 1, 2010.\nSection 7:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nSection 10:\nIt is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, \u2026\nthat deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[6] The Respondents rely on section 15 (1) (c) to justify the termination of the Complainants\u2019 employment at age 65.\nSection 15 (1):\nIt is not a discriminatory practice if\n(c) an individual\u2019s employment is terminated because that individual has reached the normal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the position of that individual.\nIII. Basis of Motions for Dismissal [7] ILWU framed the issue before the Tribunal:\n\u201cAt the time the complaints were made and referred to the Tribunal by the Commission, there was uncertainty as to the constitutional validity of Section 15 (1) (c). That uncertainty has now been removed as a result of the Federal Court of Appeal decision of Air Canada Pilot\u2019s Association v. Robert Neil Kelly et al 2012 FCA 209 (\u201cAir Canada\u201d). Accordingly the only issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether age 65 was the normal age of retirement within the meaning of Section 15 (1) (c). \u2026 (emphasis added)\n\u201cThe statistical analysis contained in the Marynuik Affidavit at paragraph 27 to 30, establish(es) that the normal age of retirement for Longshore workers was 65 or less during the relevant period.\u201d\n[8] BCMEA also relies on Air Canada stating \u201c\u2026 at all material times, mandatory retirement was, and continues to be permitted under the (CHRA).\u201d (emphasis added)\nIV. The Federal Court of Appeal Decision in Air Canada [9] The Air Canada decision of the Federal Court of Appeal is decisive on the issues raised in the Respondents preliminary motions for dismissal of the Complaints. The Court considered whether Section 15 (1) (c) was a breach of the constitutional protection against age-based discrimination but nonetheless constitutionally valid, being saved by s. 1 of the Charter.\n[10] In Air Canada The Federal Court of Appeal ruled that it was bound by the doctrine of stare decisis to follow the Supreme Court of Canada decision in McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229, [1990] S.C.J. No. 122. (McKinney); and that McKinney was binding on the Tribunal and the Federal Court.\n[11] McKinney involved a provision in the Ontario Human Rights Code which permitted mandatory retirement. The Supreme Court of Canada decided that even though the provision was a breach of the constitutional protection against age-based discrimination, it remained constitutionally valid being saved by s. 1 of the Charter.\n[12] Air Canada dealt with the mandatory retirement at age 60 of pilots George Vilven and Robert Kelly under the terms of a collective agreement and pension plan between Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association. Each pilot filed a complaint under the CHRA, Vilven in 2004, Kelly in 2006. The Tribunal heard their complaints together in 2007. Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association relied on the exception to age discrimination in s. 15 (1) (c). The Tribunal decided that in the particular circumstances of the case McKinney was no longer binding authority; and in its review of the case the Federal Court affirmed the decision of the Tribunal but did not declare that s. 15 (1) (c) was invalid, rather it engaged in a detailed analysis why McKinney did not apply to the Vilven and Kelly complaints.\nV. Summary of Litigation A. Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction to Adjudicate the Respondents\u2019 Preliminary Motion for Dismissal of the Complaints [13] BCMEA cited Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp, 2004 F.C.J. No. 439, 2004 FC 81 (affirmed 2004 FCA 363) as authority clarifying the Tribunals jurisdiction to entertain preliminary motions. The Federal Court determined that, notwithstanding the lack of any specific provision in the Act, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to dismiss, on a preliminary motion, a complaint referred to it by the Commission.\n[14] I conclude that I have jurisdiction to consider the Respondents\u2019 preliminary motions. I accept the assertion of counsel for ILWU that \u201cThe issue to be resolved is a narrow one and the factual underpinnings of the motions are straight forward.\u201d\nB. Marynuik Affidavit: Relevant Facts [15] The Marynuik Affidavit establishes the following facts and circumstances:\n1. BCMEA is the bargaining agent for its member companies.\n2. Longshore workers employed by BCMEA companies carry out loading and unloading of cargo in all ports of British Columbia.\n3. Longshore workers in British Columbia do not work in other jurisdictions.\n4. BCMEA negotiates a master collective agreement with ILWU and administers the Collective Agreement in conjunction with various Locals of ILWU.\n5. The Complainants, whether they were members of ILWU or casual workers, were sheltered by the Collective Agreement.\n6. The filing dates of each complaint of discrimination:\nJozef Antalik \u2013 April 15, 2010\nWerner Hofer \u2013 September 15, 2009\nDennis Horgan \u2013 January 20, 2010\nBob Kopeck \u2013 September 22, 2010\nKenneth Geroge Martens \u2013 November 25, 2010\nDavid Williams Gibbs \u2013 November 19, 2010\nEnricco Diricco \u2013November 25, 2010\n7. At all times during the period 1989 to the fall of 2010 the Complainants were employed pursuant to a Collective Agreement which did not include an age limit for retirement. However the Collective Agreement included a provision for pensions in Article 13 - PENSIONS. \u201c13.01 The Pension arrangements governing employees covered by this Agreement are as set forth in the Waterfront Industry Pension Plan and the Waterfront Industry Pension Agreement.\u201d Pension arrangements for union members including the Complainants were established under the Collective Agreement and governed by the Waterfront Industry Pension Plan (WIPP).\n8. During the period 1989 to the fall of 2010 WIPP defined the normal age of retirement as age 65. The Complainants attained age 65 on the following dates, and as of the first day of the month following, they were no longer eligible for longshore work:\nMr. Hofer \u2013 April 17, 2009\nMr. Horgan \u2013 June 24, 2009\nMr. Diricco \u2013 July 7, 2009\nMr. Gibbs \u2013 December 14, 2009\nMr. Kopeck \u2013 January 1, 2010\nMr. Antalik \u2013 March 19, 2010\nMr. Martens \u2013 May 15, 2010\n9. In September 2010 the Trustees of WIPP filed changes to the pension plan with the Superintendent of Financial Institutions of Canada which entitled longshore workers who turned 65 after October 31, 2010 to either retire or continue working and take their pension after age 65. In the amended WIPP the normal age of retirement is stated to be age 65.\n10. On November 2, 2010, BCMEA informed longshore workers that effective November 1, 2010, they had the option of working after age 65; and BCMEA also informed all workers who had retired between Nov. 1, 2009 and\nNovember 1, 2010 that they could choose to return to work. Complainant Gibbs did not respond and Complainant Antalik responded but chose not to be dispatched to work.\n11. In 2010 there were 4,662 longshore workers employed by BCMEA employers.\n12. Until November 1, 2010, 100% of longshore workers retired by age 65 under the terms of WIPP, and a significant number of those retirees retired before age 65.\n13. During the period 1989 to the fall of 2010 Union Foremen had similar pension arrangements to longshore workers requiring retirement on or before age 65.\n14. The Marynuik Affidavit contains a statistical analysis of the total number of Union, Welfare Paying Casual and Casual longshore workers \u2013 dispatched on a daily basis to BCMEA employers \u2013 who retired at or before age 65 in the period January 1, 2005, to October 31, 2010. The analysis was based on data retrieved from the BCMEA\u2019s internal Waterfront Human Resources Information System which contains information including birth dates and dates of change of status from active to retired with respect to all longshore workers.\n[16] I conclude that Eleanor Marynuik is significantly knowledgeable concerning the longshore industry in British Columbia, particularly with respect to the Collective Agreement between BCMEA and ILWU, and the terms and conditions of employment of longshore workers. Her affidavit is evidential, probative and comprehensive.\n[17] The Marynuik Affidavit provides a factual basis for the period during which the complainants retired; and it underpins the BCMEA\/ILWU motions for dismissal of the Complaints. The Marynuik affidavit also embraces and undermines the Complainants\u2019 allegations of discrimination.\n[18] In his letter of January 23, 2013, responding to the Commission\u2019s submissions on the motions, Mr. Bruce Laughton, Q.C., counsel for ILWU, stated that \u201cThe essence of the motion is to assert that the complainants have no chance of success on the merits of the case as they cannot dispute that age 65 is the normal age of retirement for persons in positions similar to theirs. \u2026 This motion does not in any way deprive the complainants of the ability to address the issue. They are free to file their own affidavits and produce facts which would dispute the position taken by the ILWU. \u2026 neither the complainants nor the Commission have availed themselves of that opportunity. \u2026\u201d\nC. Was Age 65 the Normal Age of Retirement within the Relevant Period? [19] It is a discriminatory practice under Sections 7 and 10 (a) of the CHRA to refuse to continue to employ an individual by reason of age or to establish a policy or practice that deprives the individual of employment by reason of age.\n[20] The retirement of the Complainants was mandated by pension provisions in the Collective Agreement; provisions integral to their employment and retirement as longshore workers; provisions which ensured certainty of income and entitlement to a pension. I conclude that the consequence of these longstanding contractual provisions, the mandatory retirement of the Complainants, was not an age-based discriminatory practice under sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\n[21] Most importantly the Respondents argued \u201c \u2026 that the normal retirement age exception in section 15 (1) (c) applies to the circumstances of these Complainants. \u2026 (an) exception \u2026 that is all that is necessary to dispose of these Complaints on the merits.\u201d\n[22] To fit within the exception the Respondents must either identify a comparator group with positions similar to the Complainants or rely on the singularity of the longshore industry in B.C. There is no comparator group with employees in similar positions at waterfront terminals in the province. However as a consequence of the singular and dominant position of BCMEA and the ILWU I conclude that the comparator group is the aggregate of ILWU long shore workers employed by BCMEA. An anomalous determination of this kind was considered appropriate in Vilven v. Air Canada, [2009] F. C. J. No 475, confirmed on appeal in Air Canada.\n[23] The stipulation in the WIPP section of the Collective Agreement that age 65 is the Normal Retirement Age in B.C.\u2019s longshore industry in B.C. is consequential, it defines age 65 as the normal age of retirement; and the statistical evidence in the Marynuik Affidavit persuades me that age 65 was the normal age of retirement in the period 2005 to 2010.\nVI. Ruling As a result of the foregoing reasons and determinations I find that the Respondents did not subject the Complainants to a discriminatory practice under s. 7 and 10 of the CHRA in the matter of their mandatory retirement at age 65. Therefore the Respondents\u2019 motions are granted and the Complaints are dismissed.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

H-6 [the Act], the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) requested the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) to institute an inquiry into two complaints by Stacey Lee Tabor (\u201cthe Complainant\u201d) against the Millbrook First Nation (\u201cthe Respondent\u201d).\n[2] In her first complaint, filed with the Commission on May 21, 2008, the Complainant alleges the Respondent engaged in discriminatory practices under sections 7 and 10 of the Act on the grounds of sex and marital status. In her second complaint, filed with the Commission on January 16, 2009, the Complainant alleges the Respondent retaliated against her for having filed her first complaint, pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act.\n[3] During a case management conference call held on February 25, 2013, counsel for the Complainant advised of his intention to file a motion to amend the complaints to add further allegations of retaliation. That motion is the subject of the present ruling.\nI. Amending Complaints [4] It is well established that the Tribunal has the authority to amend complaints \u201c...for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties\u201d (Canderel Ltd. v. Canada, [1994] 1 FC 3 (FCA); cited in Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 at para. 30). In determining whether to allow an amendment, the Tribunal does not embark on a substantive review of the merits of the proposed amendment. Rather, as a general rule, an amendment is granted unless it is plain and obvious that the allegations in the amendment sought could not possibly succeed (see Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2 at para. 6 [Bressette]; and, Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 at para. 7 [Virk]).\n[5] That said, an amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint, as this would bypass the referral process mandated by the Act (see Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1 at paras. 7-9; and, Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 45929 (CHRT) at para. 11). The proposed amendment must be linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint (see Virk at para. 7; and, Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 at paras. 17-18; and, First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2012 CHRT 24 at para. 16 [FNCFCS et al.]).\n[6] Furthermore, the issue of prejudice must be considered when an amendment is proposed. An amendment cannot be granted \u201c...if it results in a prejudice to the other party\u201d (Parent at para. 40).\nII. Ruling [7] The Complainant alleges that a number of retaliatory actions have been taken against her and her family since the filing of her complaint with the Commission in 2008. In sum, she alleges: her family\u2019s eligibility for benefits through the Respondent\u2019s social assistance program has been improperly assessed; the Respondent has pursued an unfounded welfare fraud case against her and has resisted efforts to resolve the matter; the Respondent has denied her and her son the benefit of her late father\u2019s home on the Millbrook First Nation reserve; and, that she and her husband have encountered significant difficulty accessing funding that should have been available to them to upgrade their job qualifications. The Complainant claims that these problems only started happening after she filed her complaint in 2008.\n[8] In support of her allegations of further retaliation on behalf of the Respondent, the Complainant has provided a factual outline of the events giving rise to her additional allegations and has brought forward documentation to support those allegations. Among other things, the Complainant alleges that issues with the assessment of her family\u2019s social assistance benefits and denial of her husband\u2019s social benefits by the Respondent, have been ongoing since 2008, which timeframe corresponds with the filing of her initial complaint. All her additional allegations are against the same Respondent as in her initial complaint and she believes the alleged retaliatory conduct to be linked to the filing of that initial complaint. On this basis, the Complainant has presented a tenable claim of retaliation, has linked it to the allegations giving rise to her original complaint, and it is not plain and obvious that the allegations could not possibly succeed.\n[9] The Respondent argues the Complainant, in bringing forth her additional allegations of retaliation, did not clearly set out the relief sought or the grounds relied upon, pursuant to Rule 3(1)(c) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04). However, the Complainant submits that the relief sought is already set out in the original complaint and the additional allegations of retaliation are intended to strengthen her claim for remedies. According to the Commission, the sole question to be determined on this motion is whether the complaint should be amended to allow the addition of a second retaliation complaint.\n[10] The relief sought by the Complainant in the context of the present motion was made clear during the case management conference call held on February 25, 2013: to amend the complaints to add further allegations of retaliation. Consequently, pursuant to a written submissions schedule, the Complainant provided the grounds for her request for the amendment on February 28, 2013. The Respondent provided its response thereto on March 6, 2013. The Complainant provided her reply on March 11 and 15, 2013; and, the Commission provided its submissions on March 21, 2013. In response to further correspondence on March 19, 2013, the Tribunal also provided the Respondent with the opportunity to provide additional submissions in regards to the motion to amend the complaint, specifying that the merits of the additional allegations of retaliation would be best addressed at the hearing if the motion to amend the complaint is granted. Therefore, through the case management conference call and the written submissions of the other parties, the Respondent was made aware of the relief sought and the grounds for the Complainant\u2019s motion to amend. It also had a full and ample opportunity to respond thereto. There is no prejudice to the Respondent in this regard.\n[11] The Respondent also submits that, rather than being permitted to amend her complaint, the Complainant should be required to follow the complaints procedure outlined at section 40 of the Act and file a separate retaliation complaint with the Commission. According to the Respondent, the Commission\u2019s complaint vetting process includes procedural steps that could end the matter before it reaches the Tribunal stage; and, the Respondent should not be deprived the benefit of these procedural steps. On the other hand, the Commission points to the possibility that, if the amendment is not granted, a separate hearing may have to be held in the future to address the retaliation allegations. According to the Commission, this would thwart the administration of justice and the principle of judicial economy. The Commission adds that, in any event, the Respondent will not be prejudiced by the amendment as it will have ample opportunity to respond to the allegations of retaliation before the Tribunal.\n[12] In the context of a motion to amend a complaint to add allegations of retaliation, the Tribunal has previously stated that \u201c[i]t should not be necessary for individuals to make allegations of reprisal or retaliation arising after a complaint, by way of separate proceedings\u201d (Bressette at para. 6). As the Ontario Board of Inquiry stated in Entrop v. Imperial Oil Ltd. (No. 3), (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186, at paragraph 9:\nIt would be impractical, inefficient and unfair to require individuals to make allegations of reprisals only through the format of separate proceedings. This would necessitate their going to the end of the queue to obtain investigation, conciliation and adjudication on matters which are fundamentally related to proceedings already underway. Insofar as reprisals are intended to intimidate or coerce complainants from seeking to enforce their rights under the Code, this would thwart the integrity of the initial proceedings, and make a mockery of the Code\u2019s obvious intent to safeguard complainants from adverse consequences for claiming protection under the Code.\n[13] Therefore, \u201cit makes sense for evidence of acts made in reprisal to an existing human rights complaint, to be heard within the context of the hearing into that complaint\u201d (Karen Schuyler v. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 CHRT 10 at para. 8; see also FNCFCS et al. at para. 16).\n[14] While the Respondent may not receive the benefit of an investigation and report from the Commission regarding the Complainant\u2019s additional allegations of retaliation, it will nonetheless be given a full and ample opportunity to respond to those allegations. Any prejudice in this regard can be addressed through the filing of amended Statements of Particulars by the Respondent, in response to the Complainant\u2019s amended Statement of Particulars. This will also provide the Respondent with an opportunity to address any of the Complainant\u2019s allegations that it claims are not clear, are difficult to follow or relate to alleged treatment of persons other than the Complainant.\n[15] For the foregoing reasons, the motion to amend the complaint is granted. The parties are directed to file amended Statements of Particulars pursuant to a schedule that will be established during the upcoming case management conference call on April 12, 2013.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon\nAdministrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario\nApril 10, 2013\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1658\/1311 & T1659\/1411\nStyle of Cause: Stacey Lee Tabor v.

Willicome et Wilkinson sont appel\u00e9s collectivement ci-apr\u00e8s les \u00ab intim\u00e9s \u00bb).\n[2] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate qui suit a trait \u00e0 une demande des intim\u00e9s en vue d\u2019obtenir un subp\u0153na duces tecum de m\u00eame que d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions.\nI. Le contexte [3] La plaignante soutient que la conduite discriminatoire reproch\u00e9e a eu une incidence sur son bien-\u00eatre, et la mesure de redressement qu\u2019elle souhaite obtenir du Tribunal comprend : 712,64 $ pour des m\u00e9dicaments, 56 029,15 $ pour une perte de salaire, 28 117,98 $ pour des services de consultants, ainsi que 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Dans la liste des documents pertinents qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses plaintes, la plaignante a revendiqu\u00e9 un privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des [traduction] \u00ab notes m\u00e9dicales \u00bb et des [traduction] \u00ab notes financi\u00e8res \u00bb. Par la voie d\u2019une requ\u00eate, les intim\u00e9s ont demand\u00e9 que la plaignante communique des documents se rapportant \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9tentions de nature m\u00e9dicale et financi\u00e8re. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 24 mai 2012, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\n1. Mme Palm est tenue de remettre aux intim\u00e9s une liste contenant les noms et les adresses de tous les sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9s pour des sympt\u00f4mes ou des traitements li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, la d\u00e9pression, le stress, l\u2019insomnie ou d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 dont elle impute la responsabilit\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s, et ce, au plus tard dans les six semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n2. Mme Palm est tenue d\u2019obtenir et de remettre aux intim\u00e9s tous les documents de nature m\u00e9dicale, y compris les notes d\u2019\u00e9tude clinique, les opinions, les rapports de consultation, les analyses, les r\u00e9sultats de tests, les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examens de laboratoire ainsi que les autres informations, sous forme imprim\u00e9e ou \u00e9lectronique, qui se trouvent en la possession ou sous la garde des sp\u00e9cialistes des soins de sant\u00e9 et qui se rapportent aux sympt\u00f4mes ou aux traitements li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, la d\u00e9pression, le stress, l\u2019insomnie ou les autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 que la plaignante a mentionn\u00e9s et dont elle impute la responsabilit\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s. Ces documents doivent \u00eatre remis aux intim\u00e9s au plus tard dans les six semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n3. Pour prot\u00e9ger le droit de Mme Palm \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, les documents doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s aux avocates des intim\u00e9s et ils ne peuvent \u00eatre transmis \u00e0 nulle autre personne sans en avoir obtenu l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal et avis\u00e9 Mme Palm au pr\u00e9alable. Il est interdit d\u2019utiliser les documents \u00e0 des fins autres que celles de la pr\u00e9sente instruction et, \u00e0 la conclusion de cette derni\u00e8re, les documents doivent \u00eatre restitu\u00e9s \u00e0 la plaignante.\n4. Mme Palm est tenue de remettre aux intim\u00e9s tous les documents en sa possession qui ont trait aux sommes qu\u2019elle demande pour la perte de salaire, les m\u00e9dicaments, les services de consultants ou le pr\u00e9judice moral, et ce, au plus tard dans les six semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n(Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2012 CHRT 11, paragraphe 19 [Palm])\n[4] La plaignante ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal du 24 mai 2012.\n[5] Le Tribunal a tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance le 24 septembre 2012 en vue de discuter de la question. La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal du 24 mai 2012 parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par d\u2019autres faits survenus dans sa vie et que ses m\u00e9decins et elle ne savaient pas tr\u00e8s bien ce qui \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 dans l\u2019ordonnance. Le Tribunal a clarifi\u00e9 les exigences \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 1, 2 et 4 de l\u2019ordonnance mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus, et la plaignante a reconnu qu\u2019elle comprenait ce que l\u2019on exigeait d\u2019elle. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle serait en mesure de r\u00e9pondre et de se conformer enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance et de fournir les documents requis directement aux avocates des intim\u00e9s d\u2019ici le 9 octobre 2012.\n[6] Le 9 octobre 2012, la plaignante a transmis des documents aux avocates des intim\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal dat\u00e9e le 24 mai 2012. Dans sa lettre d\u2019accompagnement, elle a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] Vous trouverez ci-joints les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux me concernant qu\u2019il m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019obtenir, ainsi que mes informations financi\u00e8res \u00e0 jour.\nPour ce qui est des notes cliniques de mon psychologue que vous avez demand\u00e9es, [\u2026] apr\u00e8s consultation et examen de l\u2019entente de confidentialit\u00e9 que j\u2019ai sign\u00e9e, ces notes ne m\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies.\n[7] Le 11 octobre 2012, les intim\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de subp\u0153na duces tecum afin que les m\u00e9decins de la plaignante comparaissent et produisent des documents devant le Tribunal. Selon les intim\u00e9s, la plaignante a bel et bien fourni un certain nombre de documents m\u00e9dicaux, mais elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal du 24 mai 2012. Ils demandent \u00e9galement d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions sur les frais de [traduction] \u00ab consultant \u00bb de la plaignante.\nII. Le Subpoena Duces Tecum [8] Selon les intim\u00e9s, bien que la plaignante ait indiqu\u00e9 les noms et les adresses de trois m\u00e9decins en rapport avec les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans sa plainte (les Drs Mehraein, Fung et Schultz), elle n\u2019a produit que des documents extraits du dossier de l\u2019un d\u2019entre eux (Dr Mehraein). Les intim\u00e9s se disent donc qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u tous les documents pertinents, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal du 24 mai 2012. Ils ajoutent que le dossier du Dr Mehraein comporte une liste de [traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes r\u00e9cents \u00bb dat\u00e9e du 2 ao\u00fbt 2012, dans laquelle figure la [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9pression \u00bb, mais les notes du dossier qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es prennent fin le 3 mars 2011, ce qui donne \u00e0 penser, selon les intim\u00e9s, que la communication des dossiers pertinents du Dr Mehraein est incompl\u00e8te. Ils indiquent aussi que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les notes du Dr Mehraein, ce dernier fournira une note de retour au travail (2 avril 2009), mais aucune note de cette nature n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e. La plaignante ne s\u2019\u00e9tant pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal du 24 mai 2012, les intim\u00e9s demandent \u00e0 ce dernier de d\u00e9livrer un subp\u0153na duces tecum afin que les m\u00e9decins comparaissent et produisent des documents.\n[9] La plaignante est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle s\u2019est conform\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal et qu\u2019elle a communiqu\u00e9 les documents m\u00e9dicaux requis. Comme elle l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 dans sa lettre d\u2019accompagnement du 9 octobre 2012, les documents m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Schultz ne lui ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 cause de l\u2019existence d\u2019une entente de confidentialit\u00e9. La plaignante ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on d\u00e9livre un subp\u0153na \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Elle ne s\u2019oppose pas non plus \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on pour les dossiers du Dr Fung, quoiqu\u2019elle dise avoir communiqu\u00e9 aux intim\u00e9s tous les documents pertinents \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Quant \u00e0 la note de retour au travail dont les intim\u00e9s font \u00e9tat, elle soutient que le dossier m\u00e9dical qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 indique que cette note ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie car il fallait obtenir des informations additionnelles.\n[10] Un subp\u0153na duces tecum a pour but de citer un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal et \u00e0 produire des documents qu\u2019il a en sa possession. Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi, le Tribunal peut, au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019archives, contraindre des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte. Pour que des pi\u00e8ces soient indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte, il doit y avoir un lien entre les renseignements ou les documents demand\u00e9s et les questions en litige. Dans Palm, j\u2019ai conclu que la plaignante avait mis son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de produire des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre aux intim\u00e9s de r\u00e9pondre convenablement aux all\u00e9gations relatives aux effets de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e discrimination sur le bien-\u00eatre de la plaignante (voir Palm, aux paragraphes 13 et 19).\n[11] Comme la plaignante n\u2019a pas pu obtenir du Dr Schultz les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux la concernant, un subp\u0153na semble \u00eatre la seule fa\u00e7on de contraindre \u00e0 produire ces documents pertinents. Par ailleurs, comme la plaignante ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un subp\u0153na pour ce qui est des documents que d\u00e9tiennent les Drs Mehraein et Fung, je crois que le fait de proc\u00e9der de cette mani\u00e8re garantira la production de tous les documents pertinents et permettra aux parties de d\u00e9passer le stade de la divulgation dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[12] En cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal d\u00e9livrera un subp\u0153na duces tecum au Dr Mehraein, au Dr Fung et au Dr Schultz afin qu\u2019ils comparaissent devant le Tribunal et produisent aux intim\u00e9s les documents suivants :\nTous les documents m\u00e9dicaux concernant Mme Leslie Palm, y compris les notes d\u2019\u00e9tudes cliniques, opinions, rapports de consultation, analyses, r\u00e9sultats de tests, r\u00e9sultats d\u2019examens de laboratoire et autres informations, sous forme imprim\u00e9e ou \u00e9lectronique, qui se rapportent \u00e0 tout sympt\u00f4me ou \u00e0 tout traitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression, au stress ou \u00e0 l\u2019insomnie.\n[13] Pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, les documents ne seront communiqu\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 la plaignante et aux avocates des intim\u00e9s et \u00e0 nulle autre personne sans l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal. Il sera interdit d\u2019utiliser les documents \u00e0 des fins autres que celles de la pr\u00e9sente instruction et, \u00e0 la conclusion de cette derni\u00e8re, ils devront \u00eatre restitu\u00e9s au m\u00e9decin qui les aura communiqu\u00e9s.\n[14] Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance aura lieu pour fixer une date mutuellement acceptable \u00e0 laquelle les m\u00e9decins compara\u00eetront devant le Tribunal, ainsi que pour discuter des autres d\u00e9tails du subp\u0153na.\n[15] Une fois que les subp\u0153nas seront d\u00e9livr\u00e9s, il serait bon que les intim\u00e9s tentent d\u2019obtenir les documents m\u00e9dicaux de mani\u00e8re informelle, ce qui \u00e9vitera d\u2019avoir \u00e0 contraindre les m\u00e9decins \u00e0 comparaitre devant le Tribunal. Cela permettra aux parties, au Tribunal et aux m\u00e9decins d\u2019\u00e9conomiser la d\u00e9pense additionnelle de temps et de ressources que repr\u00e9sente la tenue d\u2019une audience et de permettre le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance da fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive.\nIII. La demande d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions [16] Pour ce qui est du paragraphe 4 de l\u2019ordonnance qui est cit\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que la plaignante n\u2019a fourni aucun document concernant ses d\u00e9penses de m\u00e9dicaments et, ajoutent-ils, elle a produit une feuille de demande financi\u00e8re \u00e0 jour dans le cadre de sa communication, qui comporte maintenant une demande major\u00e9e de 35 598,06 $ au titre des [traduction] \u00ab consultants \u00bb (par opposition \u00e0 la demande ant\u00e9rieure de 28 117,98 $). La plaignante a produit un certain nombre de factures de cabinets juridiques et de consultants, mais elle en a expurg\u00e9 la description des services fournis. Selon les intim\u00e9s, la plaignante n\u2019a toujours pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 pourquoi elle a retenu les services des cabinets juridiques et d\u2019autres consultants, ni le lien qu\u2019il peut y avoir entre ces d\u00e9penses et la plainte. Ils sollicitent donc une ordonnance obligeant \u00e0 fournir d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions sur la demande relative aux d\u00e9penses de [traduction] \u00ab consultant \u00bb de la plaignante.\n[17] En ce qui concerne les demandes relatives aux m\u00e9dicaments, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle attend de recevoir un \u00e9tat imprim\u00e9. Pour ce qui est des d\u00e9penses relatives aux consultants, elle soutient avoir fourni les factures et les \u00e9tats applicables. Et, ajoute-t-elle, tous les factures et tous les \u00e9tats des avocats et des consultants constituent des frais directs qui r\u00e9sultent de sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans les factures. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, d\u00e9clare-t-elle : [traduction] \u00ab Ces frais ont \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9s dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente plainte et du processus en cours [\u2026] \u00bb. Selon elle, la demande financi\u00e8re \u00e0 jour comprend les frais encourus \u00e0 ce jour, lesquels continueront d\u2019augmenter tout au long de l\u2019instance.\n[18] Dans Palm, j\u2019ai conclu que les documents que d\u00e9tenait la plaignante \u00e0 propos de ses demandes concernant les frais de m\u00e9diation et de consultation \u00e9taient pertinents et qu\u2019il fallait les communiquer (Palm, au paragraphe 15), et une ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (Palm, au par. 19). La plaignante n\u2019a pas encore produit de documents concernant sa demande relative aux frais de m\u00e9dicaments, mais elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils seront fournis sous peu. Vu l\u2019engagement que la plaignante a pris, je donnerai \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re jusqu\u2019au 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013 pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance ant\u00e9rieure du Tribunal. Je tiens toutefois \u00e0 souligner que les d\u00e9lais que fixe le Tribunal sont imp\u00e9ratifs (paragraphe 1(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal) et qu\u2019un document non divulgu\u00e9 et produit ne peut pas \u00eatre produit en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience (alin\u00e9a 9(3)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal) sans l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal. Autrement dit, si la plaignante n\u2019effectue pas les communications requises, elle s\u2019expose au risque que le Tribunal n\u2019accepte pas ces preuves \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[19] Pour ce qui est des d\u00e9penses relatives aux consultants, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la r\u00e9cente demande d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 pour quelle raison elle avait retenu les services des cabinets juridiques et d\u2019autres consultants et le lien qu\u2019il y avait entre ces d\u00e9penses et sa plainte. Cependant, elle n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi certains passages des factures et des \u00e9tats qu\u2019elle a communiqu\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 expurg\u00e9s. Elle n\u2019a pas non plus revendiqu\u00e9 une forme quelconque de confidentialit\u00e9 ou de privil\u00e8ge en rapport avec ces documents. Je lui ordonne donc de produire des copies non expurg\u00e9es des factures et des \u00e9tats li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa demande relative aux d\u00e9penses de consultants ou, subsidiairement, d\u2019expliquer les passages expurg\u00e9s. La plaignante est tenue de se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance d\u2019ici le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[20] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente demande de communication vise peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 obtenir des factures d\u2019avocats concernant des frais juridiques, je renvoie les parties \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c.

Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les requ\u00eates des parties \u00e0 ce sujet et modifie par les pr\u00e9sentes les paragraphes 15 \u00e0 17 de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[15] Au moment de d\u00e9poser les renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels, la partie concern\u00e9e doit fournir le document au plaignant, \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 leurs avocats et expliquer pourquoi les renseignements qu\u2019il contient font partie d\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories de renseignements \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-dessus. La partie concern\u00e9e doit fournir une explication d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des raisons pour lesquelles la communication de ces renseignements ne serait pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[16] Les documents qui contiennent des renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels seront d\u00e9pos\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment et seront clairement identifi\u00e9s comme confidentiels. Les documents d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels seront communiqu\u00e9s au plaignant, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 leurs avocats et aux avocats de la Commission, et ils ne seront pas communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes sans l\u2019accord pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal. Toute partie souhaitant d\u00e9battre de documents ou de renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels au cours de l\u2019audience fera part au Tribunal de ses intentions; le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera alors s\u2019il convient d\u2019exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 52 de la Loi et d\u2019entendre les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00e0 huis clos.\n[17] Les documents confidentiels ne peuvent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins que celles de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Si l\u2019une des parties souhaite divulguer ou utiliser une partie des documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant confidentiels lors d\u2019une audience publique, elle doit pr\u00e9ciser quelle partie elle voudrait utiliser et suivre la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie au paragraphe 16 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Les documents conservent le statut confidentiel que leur accorde le Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que celui-ci en d\u00e9cide autrement, y compris pendant la dur\u00e9e de tout contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou appel de la d\u00e9cision, et apr\u00e8s que le jugement final aura \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires autochtones et du D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada), que l\u2019ONF avait l\u2019autorisation de filmer.\n[2] Selon l\u2019ONF, le syst\u00e8me de son du Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisant pour un enregistrement appropri\u00e9. L\u2019ONF a donc install\u00e9 un microphone additionnel pour compenser les microphones non fonctionnels. Le lendemain, le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013, le technicien de l\u2019ONF, M. Glenn Hodgins, qui avait lu tous les manuels en ligne relativement aux \u00e9quipements du Tribunal, est arriv\u00e9 t\u00f4t au Tribunal pour collaborer avec le technicien du son afin d\u2019obtenir un son utilisable. \u00c0 9 h 25 ce m\u00eame jour, le technicien du son du Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9quipement \u00e9tait en panne et qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9. M. Hodgins a donc plac\u00e9, bien en vue, des microphones sans fil en face de la barre des t\u00e9moins, du si\u00e8ge du membre pr\u00e9sidant et des trois tables des avocats, et ce, afin d\u2019\u00eatre en mesure d\u2019entendre et d\u2019enregistrer ad\u00e9quatement les d\u00e9bats, en cas de mauvais fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me de son du Tribunal. \u00c0 9 h 35, au moment m\u00eame o\u00f9 le Tribunal d\u00e9butait l\u2019audience, le syst\u00e8me de son s\u2019est mis \u00e0 fonctionner et, comme le son \u00e9tait net, on n\u2019a pas utilis\u00e9 les microphones sans fil pour l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019audience.\n[3] Dans l\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi du 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013, certains des avocats pr\u00e9sents se sont montr\u00e9 pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par la direction des cam\u00e9ras, lesquelles \u00e9taient point\u00e9es vers leur table pendant les pauses, et par la possibilit\u00e9 que leurs conversations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 film\u00e9es, ce qui soulevait la question d\u2019un \u00e9ventuel manquement au secret professionnel.\n[4] Dans la soir\u00e9e du mardi 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013, on a port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la membre pr\u00e9sidant que les microphones install\u00e9s par l\u2019ONF avaient enregistr\u00e9 en tout temps, ce qui soulevait un autre manquement possible au secret professionnel.\n[5] Le matin du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2013, la membre pr\u00e9sidant a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019on enl\u00e8ve tous les microphones sans fil de l\u2019ONF; ce qui fut fait dans l\u2019heure qui suivit l\u2019ordonnance. La membre pr\u00e9sidant a alors rencontr\u00e9 les parties dans son cabinet et les a inform\u00e9es du possible manquement au secret professionnel d\u00fb au fait que les microphones install\u00e9s par l\u2019ONF avaient enregistr\u00e9 en tout temps. On a demand\u00e9 aux parties ce qu\u2019elles en pensaient. Comme solution \u00e0 tout manquement \u00e9ventuel au secret professionnel, les parties ont sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019on ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ONF de d\u00e9truire les deux premiers jours d\u2019enregistrement.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 les parties, le Tribunal a rendu de vive voix une d\u00e9cision par laquelle il ordonnait \u00e0 l\u2019ONF de s\u2019abstenir de filmer durant les pauses et de s\u2019abstenir d\u2019utiliser les deux premiers jours d\u2019enregistrement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nouvel ordre. La membre pr\u00e9sidant a par la suite rencontr\u00e9 les gens de l\u2019ONF afin d\u2019obtenir plus d\u2019\u00e9claircissement quant aux circonstances entourant le manquement \u00e9ventuel au secret professionnel, avec une attention particuli\u00e8re aux aspects techniques. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ONF de lui fournir, par \u00e9crit, les d\u00e9tails de sa version des faits.\n[7] Plus tard ce soir\u2011l\u00e0, la membre pr\u00e9sidant a re\u00e7u des renseignements par \u00e9crit de M. Hodgins, lesquels, en plus de clarifier les faits, confirmaient qu\u2019il y avait eu un malentendu. Le matin du 1er mars 2013, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement re\u00e7u une lettre des Relations d\u2019affaires et Services juridiques de l\u2019ONF, ce qui a expliqu\u00e9 davantage les circonstances entourant les faits dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[8] Le Tribunal a fourni une copie de la lettre aux parties pendant la pause d\u00e9jeuner, et, ce soir\u2011l\u00e0, la membre pr\u00e9sidant a de nouveau rencontr\u00e9 les parties dans son cabinet pour discuter de ce qui semblait avoir constitu\u00e9 une mauvaise communication et un malentendu quant aux faits qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits. La membre pr\u00e9sidant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souhaitait r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la clarification des faits fournie par l\u2019ONF et elle a inform\u00e9 les parties que, au besoin, elle demanderait d\u2019autres explications avant de rendre une d\u00e9cision.\n[9] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, l\u2019ONF a agi de bonne foi et a accept\u00e9 de se conformer aux directives du Tribunal.\n[10] Pour \u00e9tablir un \u00e9quilibre entre le droit fondamental que poss\u00e8dent les parties de prot\u00e9ger les renseignements confidentiels et les objectifs de l\u2019ONF, j\u2019ordonne ce qui suit :\n[11] Selon la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillie, il semble que certaines conversations entre avocats aient \u00e9t\u00e9 film\u00e9es; le Tribunal ordonne donc \u00e0 l\u2019ONF de d\u00e9truire tous les \u00e9changes entre avocats, qu\u2019ils aient eu lieu \u00e0 leur table respective ou ailleurs, durant les pauses et pendant l\u2019audience, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 film\u00e9s les 25 et 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[12] Rien dans la preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser que des conversations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es en tout temps. Toutefois, afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucun manquement au secret professionnel, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ONF de d\u00e9truire tout autre enregistrement accessoire de voix relativement \u00e0 des conversations tenues en dehors du cadre de l\u2019affaire. Ce qui est r\u00e9put\u00e9 faire partie de l\u2019affaire comprend, par exemple : les expos\u00e9s introductifs, le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019un t\u00e9moin, un avocat posant des questions \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin ou s\u2019adressant au Tribunal, ce dernier qui pose des questions ou donne des directives, le greffier donnant des instructions, assermentant, et recevant la preuve. Les discussions que tiennent les membres du Tribunal entre eux ou les avocats ne sont pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant partie de l\u2019audience publique, et tout enregistrement de ces discussions doit \u00eatre d\u00e9truit. La pr\u00e9sente ordonnance s\u2019appliquera aux jours d\u2019audience des 25 et 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[13] Dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 peu vraisemblable o\u00f9 il s\u2019av\u00e9rerait impossible de s\u00e9parer les divers enregistrements sonores, le Tribunal ordonne que l\u2019ONF d\u00e9truise tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 film\u00e9 pendant les deux jours en entier, le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013 et le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Toutefois, l\u2019ONF peut utiliser tous les enregistrements, comme les entrevues, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la salle d\u2019audience en conformit\u00e9 des lignes directrices \u00e9tablies par le Tribunal.\n[14] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019ONF de se conformer aux lignes directrices actuelles du Tribunal relativement aux m\u00e9dias ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 toutes les autres qu\u2019il pourrait \u00e9mettre.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon, au nom de la formation coll\u00e9giale\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 24 avril 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T1340\/7008\nIntitul\u00e9 : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c.

La plainte et la requ\u00eate [1] Le 7 juin 2007, Diane Carolyn Emmett (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi), contre l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC), l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[2] La plaignante soutient essentiellement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a priv\u00e9e d\u2019occasions d\u2019emploi, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues masculins plus jeunes, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, et que cela d\u00e9montre une tendance \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[3] La plaignante a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux autres plaintes, soutenant qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de repr\u00e9sailles de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte initiale, en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi. La deuxi\u00e8me plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 5 mars 2008 et couvrait la p\u00e9riode du 10 septembre 2007 \u00e0 ce jour. La troisi\u00e8me plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 5 f\u00e9vrier 2009 et couvrait la p\u00e9riode de juillet 2008 \u00e0 ce jour.\n[4] Le 25 ao\u00fbt 2011, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en application des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi pour instruction. La Commission n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 l\u2019instruction des deux plaintes suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[5] Pendant une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience, tenue le 10 octobre 2012, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a avis\u00e9 les parties de son intention de d\u00e9poser, au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition sur le fond de la plainte, une requ\u00eate en radiation de certaines parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante.\n[6] Les parties se sont entendues pour pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites et pour que chaque partie ait l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations orales \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience.\n[7] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate en radiation de certaines all\u00e9gations de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. En particulier, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande :\n1. Une ordonnance radiant de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante :\na. toutes les all\u00e9gations portant sur la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes dans le groupe Direction et la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels \u00e0 l\u2019ARC, en particulier celles des paragraphes 46 \u00e0 54 et 59 \u00e0 64;\nb. toutes les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite de l\u2019\u00e2ge;\nc. le paragraphe 27, point no 10, qui demande au Tribunal d\u2019accorder une mesure de redressement contraire au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi;\nd. toutes les demandes de redressement qui sont post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte.\n2. Une ordonnance en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi pour que tous les renseignements personnels d\u2019employ\u00e9s actuels et d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui ne sont pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte, restent confidentiels.\n[8] La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue \u00e0 Toronto les 4 et 5 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Comme la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate peut avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la port\u00e9e du reste de l\u2019audition de la plainte, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu qu\u2019il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des parties d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le Tribunal rende la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\n[9] \u00c0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal a tenu le 4 mars 2013 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance afin de discuter d\u2019autres questions au sujet de la requ\u00eate. Je mentionnerai cette t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence dans les parties pertinentes de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nII. Les questions en litige [10] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve beaucoup de questions :\na. Pour quel motif le Tribunal peut-il rejeter une partie d\u2019une plainte avant de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond?\nb. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier toutes les all\u00e9gations portant sur la \u00ab sous-repr\u00e9sentation \u00bb des femmes dans le groupe Direction et dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels?\nc. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier toutes les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite de l\u2019\u00e2ge?\nd. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier la mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e au paragraphe 27, point no 10, de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante?\ne. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier toutes les demandes de mesures de redressement post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte?\nf. Le Tribunal devrait-il rendre une ordonnance en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi?\n[11] Les positions des parties au sujet de chacune de ces questions, ainsi que l\u2019analyse du Tribunal \u00e0 ce sujet, seront abord\u00e9es \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\nIII. Analyse A. Pour quel motif le Tribunal peut-il rejeter une partie d\u2019une plainte avant de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond? [12] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut rejeter une partie de la plainte avant de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 (SSEFPN et al.), et sur la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente du Tribunal Murray c. Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9, 2013 TCDP 2 (Murray).\n[13] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il peut d\u00e9cider de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 chaque cas de l\u2019approche qui permettra de trancher de fa\u00e7on efficace et rapide les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Bien qu\u2019elles reconnaissent qu\u2019il est possible pour le Tribunal de rejeter la totalit\u00e9 ou une partie d\u2019une plainte avant d\u2019avoir tenu une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond, la Commission et la plaignante soulignent que cette comp\u00e9tence devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e avec pr\u00e9caution et seulement lorsque les parties ont eu la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter des preuves et des observations au sujet des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\n[14] Je conviens que le Tribunal peut rejeter la totalit\u00e9 ou une partie d\u2019une plainte avant d\u2019avoir tenu une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond. Cependant, il est important de se souvenir que dans les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans SSEFPN et al. et Murray, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et le Tribunal ont clairement exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis selon lequel le processus de rejet d\u2019all\u00e9gations doit \u00eatre juste, qu\u2019il doit respecter les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle et que les parties doivent avoir la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter les preuves n\u00e9cessaires pour que soient tranch\u00e9es les questions soulev\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate. Je reproduis ci\u2011dessous certains extraits pertinents de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans SSEFPN et al. :\n[125] Cela dit, la Loi pr\u00e9voit aussi, au paragraphe 50(1), que le membre \u00e0 qui l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9e donne \u00e0 toutes les personnes ayant re\u00e7u l\u2019avis pr\u00e9vu \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb.\n[\u2026]\n[131] Rien dans la Loi ou dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure ne restreint le type de requ\u00eates qui peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant le Tribunal. Il n\u2019existe donc selon moi aucun obstacle l\u00e9gislatif ou r\u00e9glementaire emp\u00eachant une partie de demander par requ\u00eate au Tribunal de se prononcer sur une question de fond avant l\u2019instruction compl\u00e8te de la plainte.\n[132] Ni la Loi ni les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal n\u2019emp\u00eachent non plus le Tribunal de statuer sur une telle requ\u00eate, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il donne aux parties la \u00ab possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00bb de pr\u00e9senter la preuve n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher la question et de pr\u00e9senter des observations. Le processus suivi par le Tribunal pour l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate doit aussi \u00eatre \u00e9quitable et le Tribunal doit respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[\u2026]\n[140] Je comprends cependant que le gouvernement soit d\u2019accord avec l\u2019affirmation, formul\u00e9e dans Buffet, selon laquelle la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour rejeter une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 une \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire ne devrait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9e qu\u2019avec prudence, et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs : pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au par. 39. Je suis \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec cette d\u00e9claration.\n(FNCFCS et al., aux paragraphes 125, 131,132 et 140.)\n[15] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, j\u2019examinai si certaines parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante devraient \u00eatre radi\u00e9es.\nB. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier toutes les all\u00e9gations portant sur la \u00ab sous\u2011repr\u00e9sentation \u00bb des femmes dans le groupe Direction et dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels? [16] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse aux observations de la plaignante et de la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a modifi\u00e9 sa position en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question B, de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\n[traduction]\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019oppose plus \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019instruire les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019effectif de la direction. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal des directives et demande \u00e0 la plaignante de cibler pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les lignes de conduite qu\u2019elle estime \u00eatre discriminatoires.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e continue de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019instruire les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe en ce qui a trait aux autres groupes professionnels mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. Les all\u00e9gations au sujet de ces autres groupes n\u2019ont jamais fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate de la Commission, sont fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des preuves statistiques et ne ciblent aucune politique ou pratique pr\u00e9cise.\n(Observations en r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (requ\u00eate en radiation de partie de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante), 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013, aux paragraphes 2 et 3.)\n[17] L\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au sujet de cette question comporte trois aspects : (i) le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire des plaintes fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des preuves statistiques; (ii) la plaignante a modifi\u00e9 sa plainte de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e afin d\u2019y ajouter de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels; (iii) la plaignante n\u2019a pas cibl\u00e9 de ligne de conduite pr\u00e9cise de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 son avis, est discriminatoire. Chaque argument sera examin\u00e9 \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n(i) Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour instruire des plaintes fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des preuves statistiques? [18] Le texte du paragraphe 40.1(2) de la Loi est le suivant :\n(2) La Commission ne peut se fonder sur l\u2019article 40 pour conna\u00eetre des plaintes qui, \u00e0 la fois, sont\na) faites contre un employeur et d\u00e9non\u00e7ant la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 ou \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a);\nb) fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante en ce qui a trait aux autres groupes professionnels sont fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des preuves statistiques qui \u00e9tablissent la sous\u2011repr\u00e9sentation, ce qui contrevient au paragraphe 40.1(2). L\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que, lorsque la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, L.C. 1995, ch. 44 (la LEE), est entr\u00e9e en vigueur, des modifications ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi afin d\u2019harmoniser les deux lois et d\u2019\u00e9viter les chevauchements. En particulier, le paragraphe 40.1(2) a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans les situations o\u00f9 une plainte est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur des preuves statistiques de sous\u2011repr\u00e9sentation, la plainte devrait \u00eatre instruite en vertu de la LEE et non de la Loi. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, l\u2019intim\u00e9e mentionne le compte rendu des proc\u00e9dures et des t\u00e9moignages du comit\u00e9 permanent qui a examin\u00e9 les modifications \u00e0 la LEE et \u00e0 la Loi.\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 dans le paragraphe 40.1(2), a les m\u00eames obligations que la Commission en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019application de ce paragraphe. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il n\u2019est pas logique que la Commission ait l\u2019obligation de refuser d\u2019examiner des plaintes fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des renseignements statistiques, alors que le Tribunal n\u2019aurait pas la m\u00eame obligation.\n[21] La Commission est d\u2019avis que le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 40.1(2) est clair et qu\u2019il s\u2019applique uniquement \u00e0 la Commission. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 40.1(2). Selon la Commission, le Tribunal est un organisme distinct et ind\u00e9pendant de la Commission. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019avoir recours aux comptes rendus des proc\u00e9dures du comit\u00e9 permanent qui examinait les modifications \u00e0 la LEE et \u00e0 la Loi pour comprendre le paragraphe 40.1(2). La Commission soutient que ce paragraphe fait partie des articles 40 \u00e0 46 de la Loi, qui expliquent le r\u00f4le de la Commission quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception et au traitement des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi.\n[22] La plaignante souscrit \u00e0 la position adopt\u00e9e par la Commission en ce qui a trait au fait que le paragraphe 40.1(2) ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cependant, elle soutient que ses all\u00e9gations ne sont pas fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des renseignements statistiques. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, elle renvoie au paragraphe 62 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions :\n[traduction]\nUn exemple d\u2019obstacle syst\u00e9mique \u00e9tait la pratique de n\u2019avoir aucune proc\u00e9dure fixe ou processus de s\u00e9lection officielle pour les nominations faites aux postes de directeur par int\u00e9rim. La nomination presque exclusive de coll\u00e8gues masculins \u00e0 ces occasions propices \u00e0 l\u2019avancement de carri\u00e8re \u00e9tait faite de fa\u00e7on subjective et non transparente plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en ayant recours \u00e0 des concours afin d\u2019\u00e9valuer les qualifications et les comp\u00e9tences de toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. [\u2026] M\u00eame lorsque des concours \u00e9taient tenus pour des promotions \u00e0 des postes de direction, les processus de s\u00e9lection de l\u2019ARC comprenaient des m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9valuation subjective utilis\u00e9es lors d\u2019entrevues d\u2019une demi-heure pour lesquelles des notes d\u2019\u00e9valuation globales \u00e9taient donn\u00e9es, plut\u00f4t que des techniques d\u2019\u00e9valuation plus rigoureuses, impartiales et objectives. Des pratiques de dotation informelle et hautement discr\u00e9tionnaire sont probl\u00e9matiques parce qu\u2019on donne beaucoup de place \u00e0 des questions subjectives, des normes diff\u00e9rentes et de la partialit\u00e9. Je soutiens que ces pratiques syst\u00e9miques discriminatoires ont eu des r\u00e9percussions d\u00e9favorables sur l\u2019avancement de carri\u00e8re des femmes dans la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Ontario (RO) ainsi que sur mon avancement personnel aux postes de direction auxquels j\u2019aspirais.\n(Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, 30 avril 2012, au paragraphe 62.)\n[23] Je reconnais que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi emp\u00eache la Commission de traiter des plaintes qui seraient \u00ab [\u2026] fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur \u00bb (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi). Cependant, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 cet alin\u00e9a. En fait, les articles 40 \u00e0 46 portent exclusivement sur le r\u00f4le de la Commission dans le traitement des plaintes et le paragraphe 40.1(2) fait partie de ces articles.\n[24] Les r\u00f4les de la Commission et du Tribunal sont clairement d\u00e9finis dans la Loi. En ce qui a trait aux plaintes, le r\u00f4le du Tribunal est de les instruire, lorsque la Commission conclue qu\u2019une telle instruction est justifi\u00e9e (voir les articles 49 et 50 de la Loi). Bien que je suppose que la Commission a examin\u00e9 la plainte conform\u00e9ment aux exigences du paragraphe 40.1(2) de la Loi, il ne revient pas, de toute fa\u00e7on, au Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission ou \u00e0 son contr\u00f4le. C\u2019est le r\u00f4le de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en contr\u00f4le judiciaire (voir Murray, au paragraphe 37; Deborah P. Labelle c. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 71; International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), section locale 400 c. Oster, [2002] 2 CF 430, aux paragraphes 29 et 30; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Warman, 2012 CF 1162, aux paragraphes 55 \u00e0 57; et Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, aux paragraphes 23, 27 et 33).\n[25] Comme le paragraphe 40.1(2) de la Loi porte exclusivement sur la Commission, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019affecte pas la capacit\u00e9 de Tribunal d\u2019examiner les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. Cela dit, les plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en application des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi visent des actes discriminatoires qui sont d\u00e9crits dans la plainte, et non une sous-repr\u00e9sentation en soi. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question de savoir si les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante sont fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des renseignements statistiques de sous-repr\u00e9sentation sera examin\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de toute la preuve de la plaignante. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape actuelle, avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u la preuve sur le fond des all\u00e9gations de la plaignante, je ne peux pas \u00e9tablir si ces all\u00e9gations sont fond\u00e9es seulement sur des renseignements statistiques de sous-repr\u00e9sentation. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment adopt\u00e9 une approche semblable dans Murray :\n[48] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord non plus pour dire que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi restreint maintenant la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019article 40,1 de la Loi s\u2019applique strictement \u00e0 la Commission et, une fois qu\u2019une instruction est demand\u00e9e, il incombe au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte. \u00c0 mon avis, une fois qu\u2019une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, la question de savoir si la plainte est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur des preuves statistiques doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au moment de d\u00e9cider si la plaignante a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019instance, avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u une preuve quelconque quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, rien ne permet au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider si la plainte repose uniquement sur des preuves statistiques et, de ce fait, si elle a permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie.\n[49] C\u2019est donc dire que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi ne restreint pas la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte.\n(Murray, aux paragraphes 48 \u00e0 49.)\n[26] Dans un m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, je conclus que le paragraphe 40.1(2) de la Loi n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le Tribunal d\u2019instruire les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n(ii) La plaignante a-t-elle modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e sa plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels? [27] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, des all\u00e9gations au sujet de la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes dans des groupes professionnels autres que le groupe de Direction ne sont apparues que dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019avantage d\u2019un examen par la Commission de cette all\u00e9gations ni l\u2019occasion d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre devant l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission. \u00c0 son avis, l\u2019all\u00e9gation portant sur la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels est une nouvelle plainte et l\u2019intim\u00e9e subirait un pr\u00e9judice si cette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun lien entre cette nouvelle all\u00e9gation et la plainte originale.\n[28] Quant \u00e0 elle, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 sa plainte et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de la nature syst\u00e9mique de sa plainte en ce qui a trait aux femmes dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t initial de la plainte et au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission. Pendant l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la plaignante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019examiner la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes tant dans le groupe Direction que dans les autres groupes professionnels appuierait son all\u00e9gation de probl\u00e8mes syst\u00e9miques selon laquelle des attitudes enracin\u00e9es d\u00e9favorables envers l\u2019avancement des femmes se sont manifest\u00e9es dans des comportements qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions de dotation discriminatoires prises lors de processus de dotation informels et subjectifs. \u00c0 ce sujet, la plaignante soutient que les statistiques de sous-repr\u00e9sentation peuvent servir de preuves circonstancielles \u00e0 partir desquelles on peut conclure qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination.\n[29] Je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que la plaignante a modifi\u00e9 sa plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Les all\u00e9gations qui constituent le fondement d\u2019une plainte doivent \u00eatre distingu\u00e9es de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette plainte. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, au paragraphe 63, la plaignante fait la distinction entre les deux :\n[traduction]\nJe suis aussi d\u2019avis que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9e \u00e0 des attitudes enracin\u00e9es et des obstacles culturels qui ont \u00e9tabli le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif selon lequel les femmes dans le domaine de la v\u00e9rification (mon domaine) ne sont pas aussi fortes et capables que les hommes dans des r\u00f4les de leadership. La preuve montre clairement que les v\u00e9rificatrices ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ARC. Elles ont aussi toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 exclues des plus hauts niveaux de l\u2019organisation, en particulier du niveau de direction, o\u00f9 elles \u00e9taient pratiquement inexistantes pendant la p\u00e9riode couverte par ma plainte. Je suis d\u2019avis que des pratiques discriminatoires syst\u00e9miques ont emp\u00each\u00e9 les femmes du domaine de la v\u00e9rification d\u2019avancer \u00e0 des postes de direction importants dans l\u2019organisation de l\u2019ARC. Je soutiens que ces pratiques ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur qui a entrav\u00e9 mon avancement \u00e0 un poste de direction dans la RO.\n(Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, 30 avril 2012, au paragraphe 63.)\n[30] Comme cette d\u00e9claration le montre, la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes \u00e0 l\u2019ARC n\u2019est pas le fondement des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique de la plaignante. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t des \u00ab [\u2026] attitudes enracin\u00e9es et des obstacles culturels qui ont \u00e9tabli le st\u00e9r\u00e9otype n\u00e9gatif [qui a] emp\u00each\u00e9 les femmes du domaine de la v\u00e9rification d\u2019avancer \u00e0 des postes de direction importants dans l\u2019organisation de l\u2019ARC \u00bb qui servent de fondement aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique de la plaignante. La plaignante utilise les renseignements statistiques au sujet du fait que les v\u00e9rificatrices ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 sous repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ARC, que ce soit dans le groupe Direction ou dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels, comme preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. La question de savoir si cette preuve appuie les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante ou \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination sera tranch\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de la plainte.\n[31] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux arguments de la plaignante en pr\u00e9sentant son propre expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura aussi la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de pr\u00e9senter ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subit aucun pr\u00e9judice du fait que la plaignante pr\u00e9sente des renseignements statistiques au sujet de la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels \u00e0 l\u2019ARC \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique.\n(iii) La plaignante a-t-elle cibl\u00e9 une ligne de conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 son avis, est discriminatoire? [32] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante n\u2019a pas cibl\u00e9 une ligne de conduite pr\u00e9cise de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 son avis, serait discriminatoire. Plut\u00f4t, en se fondant uniquement sur des renseignements statistiques, la plaignante \u00e9tablit sa plainte de discrimination syst\u00e9mique en utilisant des all\u00e9gations vagues et impr\u00e9cises de \u00ab culture organisationnelle \u00bb, d\u2019\u00ab obstacles comportementaux \u00bb et de \u00ab club r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux hommes \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plainte ne porte pas sur des pratiques de dotation informelles discernables, mais plut\u00f4t sur la perception de la plaignante de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la gestion, qui aurait, selon elle, \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9 par des obstacles comportementaux et culturels.\n[33] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\n12. [...] Je pr\u00e9senterai aussi des preuves d\u00e9montrant que la pratique d\u2019accorder des occasions d\u2019int\u00e9rim durant la p\u00e9riode couverte par ma plainte a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des obstacles syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 l\u2019avancement des femmes dans le groupe Direction de la r\u00e9gion de l\u2019Ontario. La nature informelle et subjective de ces pratiques a permis \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9 et au pr\u00e9judice de guider les d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019ARC, que ce soit de fa\u00e7on intentionnelle ou non, ce qui a eu des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur les carri\u00e8res de femmes dans le domaine de la direction, y compris sur ma propre carri\u00e8re. Par exemple, aucune affectation int\u00e9rimaire n\u2019\u00e9tait annonc\u00e9e; aucune lettre d\u2019appel n\u2019\u00e9tait distribu\u00e9e afin de demander aux personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es de pr\u00e9senter leur candidature, une pratique qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 des obstacles et qui a entrav\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s juste aux directeurs qualifi\u00e9s; toutes les nominations int\u00e9rimaires \u00e9taient faites de fa\u00e7on informelle, sans qu\u2019un concours n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tenu; les directeurs nomm\u00e9s \u00e9taient choisis en fonction des opinions personnelles du sous-commissaire et du comit\u00e9 de planification de la rel\u00e8ve qui \u00e9tait form\u00e9 uniquement d\u2019hommes; les qualifications pour les postes int\u00e9rimaires n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019avance et les comp\u00e9tences n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9valu\u00e9es afin de garantir que le candidat choisi \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 et \u00e9tait le bon directeur pour le poste, alors que l\u2019ARC mentionne au paragraphe 56 que c\u2019\u00e9tait son objectif; le seul raisonnement document\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision de s\u00e9lection de l\u2019ARC \u00e9tait un bref avis de nomination citant des raisons g\u00e9n\u00e9riques telles qu\u2019assurer la continuit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de gestion; une grande partie des candidats choisis ont pu rester dans leurs postes int\u00e9rimaires pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de six mois \u00e0 plus de 15 mois, sans avoir \u00e0 participer \u00e0 un concours ou sans que leurs qualifications ne soit \u00e9valu\u00e9es; et dans les cas o\u00f9 le directeur int\u00e9rimaire souhaitait occuper le poste officiellement, il \u00e9tait par la suite nomm\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on permanente \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019un concours vici\u00e9.\n[\u2026]\n19. Au paragraphe 55, l\u2019ARC soutient que je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on injuste ou arbitraire au cours du processus de s\u00e9lection de 2006, parce que M. Baker a tir\u00e9 cette conclusion, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 un appel en mati\u00e8re de dotation que j\u2019ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab r\u00e9vision de la d\u00e9cision \u00bb. Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019ARC. \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de M. Baker \u00e9tait gravement erron\u00e9e, partiale et il a simplement approuv\u00e9 automatiquement les r\u00e9sultats du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection. Par exemple, on m\u2019a refus\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 mes documents d\u2019\u00e9valuation de la source, ce qui m\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer un appel fond\u00e9 sur les faits pertinents. On ne m\u2019a jamais donn\u00e9 de motif justifiant le rejet de mon appel. On n\u2019a jamais abord\u00e9 en discussion avec moi les anomalies du processus de s\u00e9lection que j\u2019avais soulev\u00e9es dans mon appel et on ne m\u2019a jamais donn\u00e9 l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019ARC \u00e0 mon document d\u2019appel. L\u2019ARC a cat\u00e9goriquement manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la justice naturelle envers moi dans le cadre du recours que j\u2019avais exerc\u00e9. En plus de tout \u00e7a, M. Baker, qui devait r\u00e9viser la d\u00e9cision faisant l\u2019objet de mon appel, \u00e9tait la personne qui avait approuv\u00e9 la nomination des candidats retenus dans le processus de s\u00e9lection au sujet duquel je portais appel, ce qui soul\u00e8ve de graves questions de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. De plus, M. Baker \u00e9tait aussi le patron de M. Hillier, le responsable du processus de s\u00e9lection. La proc\u00e9dure de recours dans le cadre d\u2019un concours pour un poste de direction \u00e0 l\u2019ARC est unique \u00e0 la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, parce que les candidats non retenus qui souhaitent exercer un recours dans le cadre d\u2019un concours n\u2019ont pas le droit \u00e0 une audience d\u2019appel devant un tiers ind\u00e9pendant. Ce qui existe \u00e0 l\u2019ARC est un processus injuste de r\u00e9vision interne sur dossier o\u00f9 des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs enqu\u00eatent sur d\u2019autres cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, ce qui \u00e0 mon avis permet une importante partialit\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision.\n(R\u00e9ponse de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, 19 juin 2012, aux paragraphes 12 et 19.)\n[34] Pour ce motif, je suis convaincu que la plaignante a cibl\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante les lignes de conduite qui, \u00e0 son avis, \u00e9taient discriminatoires en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Les observations de la plaignante sont suffisantes pour aviser l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De plus, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a et aura la pleine et enti\u00e8re occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je rejette les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lesquels : (i) le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire des plaintes fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des preuves statistiques; (ii) la plaignante a modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e sa plainte afin d\u2019y ajouter de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels; (iii) la plaignante n\u2019a pas cibl\u00e9 de ligne de conduite pr\u00e9cise de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qu\u2019elle juge discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la demande de radiation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de toutes les all\u00e9gations dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante portant sur la \u00ab sous-repr\u00e9sentation \u00bb des femmes dans d\u2019autres groupes professionnels \u00e0 l\u2019ARC.\nC. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier toutes les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite de l\u2019\u00e2ge? [36] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, dans sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal, la Commission a clairement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe de la plaignante, mais n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de discrimination individuelle ou syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le silence de la Commission sur la question devrait signifier que la Commission n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge au Tribunal. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e reconnaisse que la discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge est mentionn\u00e9e dans le formulaire de plainte, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a recommand\u00e9 le rejet des deux all\u00e9gations. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a suppos\u00e9 que la Commission avait adopt\u00e9 les recommandations de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas renvoyer ces all\u00e9gations au Tribunal.\n[37] La Commission ne souscrit pas \u00e0 la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La Commission soutient que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge sont inscrites dans le formulaire de plainte et que la plainte en entier, sans exclusion, a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. En particulier, la Commission mentionne la lettre du 25 ao\u00fbt 2011 envoy\u00e9e par le vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, dans laquelle il demandait : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] que vous instruisiez la plainte puisque la Commission est convaincue que, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, une instruction est justifi\u00e9e [\u2026] Une copie du formulaire de plainte est inclus. \u00bb\n[38] Selon la Commission, l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab compte tenu de toutes les circonstances \u00bb signifiait que cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise apr\u00e8s un examen de tous les renseignements et de tous les documents au dossier, y compris le formulaire de plainte, le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur et l\u2019\u00e9change de communications \u00e9crites entre les parties. De plus, le fait que le formulaire de plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus signifie que la Commission n\u2019avait pas renvoy\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie de la plainte, mais avait plut\u00f4t renvoy\u00e9 la plainte en entier. Pour cette raison, la Commission soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune raison de supposer qu\u2019elle n\u2019a renvoy\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie de la plainte au Tribunal.\n[39] La position de la plaignante au sujet de la question C est la suivante :\n[traduction]\n16. [\u2026] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 ma plainte de discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et l\u2019\u00e2ge au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. La d\u00e9cision de la Commission ne pr\u00e9cisait pas que son renvoi excluait la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Le Tribunal est par cons\u00e9quent saisi de ma plainte compl\u00e8te, qui comprend la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge [\u2026] De plus, la Commission pr\u00e9cise dans sa d\u00e9cision du 10 ao\u00fbt 2011 qu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9 ma plainte, le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et les observations des parties et que, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, elle renvoie ma plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Les documents que la Commission a examin\u00e9s font \u00e9tat du fait que ma plainte est fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de discrimination du sexe et de l\u2019\u00e2ge, au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Mes arguments \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, que la Commission a examin\u00e9 et dont elle a tenu compte lorsqu\u2019elle a rendu sa d\u00e9cision. La preuve montre clairement que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 mes all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge au Tribunal, donnant ainsi comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal pour les instruire.\n(Observations de la plaignante en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dat\u00e9e du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, 25 janvier 2013, au paragraphe 16.)\n[40] Compte tenu du formulaire de plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis au Tribunal, il me semble que la plaignante a clairement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que sa plainte portait sur la discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Si la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter les all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, elle aurait rendu une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 ce sujet, aurait fourni des motifs pour ce rejet et, par la suite, aurait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que cette partie de la plainte \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e dans sa lettre de renvoi au Tribunal. Ce n\u2019est pas le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[41] Une question semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 TCDP 32 [C\u00f4t\u00e9]. Je trouve les commentaires de l\u2019ancien membre Hadjis instructifs en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n\u00c0 mon avis, il est \u00e9vident \u00e0 la lecture de la lettre de la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal que tous les aspects de la plainte, tels que formul\u00e9s dans le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 par la plaignante en 1996, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9s au Tribunal par la Commission. Je ne vois rien dans la lettre de la pr\u00e9sidente de la Commission qui permette de conclure qu\u2019une partie seulement de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate. En outre, il ne faut pas perdre de vue le fait que, m\u00eame si la Commission est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si une plainte doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal (par. 44(3) et art. 49 de la Loi), la plainte demeure celle de la plaignante et non celle de la Commission. La plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019a jamais modifi\u00e9 sa plainte.\n(C\u00f4t\u00e9, au paragraphe 12.)\n[42] En comparaison \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9, je trouve la d\u00e9cision du membre Hadjis dans Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22 [Kowalski], aussi instructive. Dans Kowalski, le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 quatre all\u00e9gations de discrimination. La Commission a rejet\u00e9 deux de ces all\u00e9gations. Elle a avis\u00e9 les parties de sa d\u00e9cision. Cependant, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal sans mentionner sa d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. La question qui a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e devant le Tribunal \u00e9tait la suivante : la Commission a-t-elle renvoy\u00e9 seulement une partie ou la totalit\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations au Tribunal. Le membre Hadjis a conclu :\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas traiter deux des quatre all\u00e9gations dans la plainte et a fait parvenir aux parties des d\u00e9cisions \u00e9crites \u00e0 ce sujet, qui portaient toutes les deux le titre [traduction] \u00ab D\u00e9cision de la Commission \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est clair que la Commission a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, en vertu de l\u2019article 41, de ne pas traiter ces all\u00e9gations. Compte tenu des d\u00e9cisions explicites de la Commission \u00e0 ce sujet, je suis convaincu que la Commission n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9 ces parties de la plainte au Tribunal.\n(Kowalski, au paragraphe 10.)\n[43] Je trouve important de mentionner que la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, il revient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de convaincre le Tribunal d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter certaines parties de la plainte, un pouvoir que le Tribunal exerce avec prudence et seulement dans les cas les plus clairs (FNCFCS et al., au paragraphe 140). Compte tenu de cette mise en garde et du libell\u00e9 clair du formulaire de plainte et de la lettre de renvoi au Tribunal, je ne suis pas convaincu que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 seulement une partie de la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Pour ces motifs, je rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en radiation de toutes les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif illicite de l\u2019\u00e2ge de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante.\nD. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier la mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e au paragraphe 27, point no 10, de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante? [44] La mesure de redressement en question est la suivante :\n[traduction]\n10. La preuve d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie de dotation agressive visant \u00e0 combler, et garder combl\u00e9es, les lacunes existantes dans toutes les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00e0 l\u2019ARC.\n(Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, 30 avril 2012.)\n[45] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e par la plaignante contrevient au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi. L\u2019article 54.1 pr\u00e9voit :\n54.1 (1) Les d\u00e9finitions qui suivent s\u2019appliquent au pr\u00e9sent article.\n\u00ab employeur \u00bb Toute personne ou organisation charg\u00e9e de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des obligations de l\u2019employeur pr\u00e9vues par la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n\u00ab groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s \u00bb S\u2019entend au sens de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n(2) Le tribunal qui juge fond\u00e9e une plainte contre un employeur ne peut lui ordonner, malgr\u00e9 le sous-alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i), d\u2019adopter un programme, plan ou arrangement comportant des r\u00e8gles et usages positifs destin\u00e9s \u00e0 corriger la sous\u2011repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans son effectif ou des objectifs et calendriers \u00e0 cet effet.\n(3) Il est entendu que le paragraphe (2) n\u2019a pas pour effet de restreindre le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au tribunal par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier de toute autre mani\u00e8re.\n[46] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au sujet de la question D est la suivante :\n[traduction]\n63. Lorsqu\u2019il conclut qu\u2019une plainte est fond\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut accorder au plaignant une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP. Selon cette disposition, le Tribunal peut, conform\u00e9ment au sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i), ordonner qu\u2019une personne adopte un programme, un plan ou un arrangement sp\u00e9ciaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 diminuer ou \u00e0 supprimer les d\u00e9savantages subis pour des motifs fond\u00e9s, directement ou indirectement, sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n64. Cependant, la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019accorder une mesure de redressement en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP est nuanc\u00e9e par l\u2019article 54.1. En vertu de cette disposition, le Tribunal \u00ab ne peut [\u2026] ordonner, malgr\u00e9 le sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i) \u00bb \u00e0 un employeur qui est assujetti aux dispositions de la LEE d\u2019adopter notamment des r\u00e8gles et usages positifs destin\u00e9s \u00e0 augmenter la repr\u00e9sentation des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. Le paragraphe 54.1(3) pr\u00e9cise que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner des mesures de redressement exigeant d\u2019un employeur qu\u2019il mette fin \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou qu\u2019il y rem\u00e9die. Cependant, la plaignante n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 d\u2019acte discriminatoire dans ses all\u00e9gations.\n65. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante demande une mesure de redressement vis\u00e9e au sous-alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire [traduction] \u00ab La preuve d\u2019une strat\u00e9gie de dotation agressive visant \u00e0 combler, et garder combl\u00e9es, les lacunes existantes dans toutes les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi [chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e] \u00bb. Une strat\u00e9gie de dotation agressive visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire ou \u00e0 supprimer les d\u00e9savantages pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s envers les femmes est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le type de r\u00e8gles et usages positifs vis\u00e9s au sous-alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i) qui est interdit par l\u2019article 54.1 parce qu\u2019il touche un employeur assujetti \u00e0 la LEE. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e est un employeur au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4c) de la LEE, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder la mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e par la plaignante, en application du paragraphe 54.1 de la LCDP. Pour ce motif, cette partie de la demande de redressement de la plaignante devrait \u00eatre radi\u00e9e.\n(Observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (Requ\u00eate en radiation de parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante), 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, aux paragraphes 63 \u00e0 65.)\n[47] Selon la Commission, il appara\u00eet clairement \u00e0 la lecture de l\u2019article 54.1 que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de redressement n\u00e9cessaire pour pr\u00e9venir les actes discriminatoires et y rem\u00e9dier. Le paragraphe 54.1(2) ne limite pas le pouvoir du Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin a`un acte discriminatoire ou d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier de toute autre mani\u00e8re. En fait, la Commission soutient que la Loi autorise express\u00e9ment le Tribunal \u00e0 utiliser ses pouvoirs de redressement afin de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la discrimination syst\u00e9mique comme celle all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par la plaignante.\n[48] En r\u00e9ponse aux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au sujet de la question D, la plaignante a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de modifier sa demande de redressement de la fa\u00e7on suivante : [traduction] \u00ab que l\u2019ARC mette fin \u00e0 ses pratiques informelles et subjectives de dotation que j\u2019ai cibl\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant discriminatoires dans ma plainte ou qu\u2019elle y rem\u00e9die \u00bb (Observations de la plaignante en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dat\u00e9e du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, 25 janvier 2013, au paragraphe 17). Selon la plaignante, en application du paragraphe 54.1(3) de la Loi, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner la mesure de redressement modifi\u00e9e.\n[49] Pendant la deuxi\u00e8me journ\u00e9e de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, bien que la Commission ne f\u00fbt pas pr\u00e9sente, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont conclu une entente au sujet de la modification propos\u00e9e \u00e0 la mesure de redressement de la plaignante.

Dans les circonstances, et compte tenu du fait que la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pourrait encore modifier sa plainte en fonction de la preuve qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que toute modification \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante devrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par voie de requ\u00eate officielle, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[57] Pendant la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance du 4 mars 2013, la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 leurs positions respectives. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante avait accept\u00e9 de modifier sa mesure de redressement afin qu\u2019elle soit conforme \u00e0 la Loi. Selon la plaignante, la mesure de redressement modifi\u00e9e respecte le libell\u00e9 de la Loi et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle est conforme avec ce que les parties ont convenu lors de l\u2019audience. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la mesure de redressement est une question qui devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[58] La Commission a aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence du 4 mars 2013. Elle a soutenu que les mesures de redressement doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on globale et qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9cises. Selon la Commission, la plaignante peut modifier ses mesures de redressement tant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019est pas prise par surprise\n[59] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au point D \u00e9tait d\u2019abord une opposition fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi. La question comprend maintenant une pr\u00e9occupation au sujet de la modification de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante. J\u2019examinerai chaque question \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n[60] En ce qui a trait au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi, le libell\u00e9 est clair. Des r\u00e8gles et usages positifs destin\u00e9s \u00e0 corriger la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif, y compris des objectifs ou des calendriers visant l\u2019augmentation des taux de repr\u00e9sentation, rel\u00e8vent de la LEE. Dans la d\u00e9cision Murray, le Tribunal a tir\u00e9 une conclusion semblable :\nPar opposition \u00e0 l\u2019article 40.1, qui vise uniquement la Commission, l\u2019article 54,1 de la Loi s\u2019applique bel et bien au Tribunal. L\u00e0 encore, ce dernier ne conteste pas que l\u2019ajout de cette disposition avait pour but d\u2019\u00e9viter le d\u00e9doublement des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la LEE et de la Loi. C\u2019est ce qui ressort clairement quand on examine l\u2019article 10 de la LEE, qui oblige les employeurs \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les questions mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi dans le cadre de leurs plans d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi respectifs. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le l\u00e9gislateur a opt\u00e9 pour une approche coop\u00e9rative et concert\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des questions mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi par la voie d\u2019un : \u00ab [\u2026] r\u00e8glement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 en vue de l\u2019obtention d\u2019un engagement [\u2026] \u00bb entre la Commission et les employeurs sous le r\u00e9gime de la LEE (voir les paragraphes 22(1) et 22(2) de la LEE). Je conviens donc avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le Tribunal ne peut pas rendre une ordonnance obligeant un intim\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des r\u00e8gles et des usages positifs con\u00e7us pour garantir que les membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s soient davantage repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur. Le Tribunal ne peut pas non plus rendre une ordonnance qui fixe des buts et des calendriers en vue d\u2019atteindre cette repr\u00e9sentation sup\u00e9rieure.\n(Murray, au paragraphe 54.)\n[61] Cependant, le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 54.1(3) de la Loi est aussi clair. Malgr\u00e9 les limites du paragraphe 54.1(2), le Tribunal peut toujours \u00ab [\u2026] ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier de toute autre mani\u00e8re \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 54.1(3) de la Loi). Une fois de plus, le raisonnement du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Murray est instructif :\nCela dit, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que les limites pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi restreignent la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une mesure de redressement concr\u00e8te. Le paragraphe 54.1(3) pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que le paragraphe 54.1(2) ne restreint pas le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier de toute autre mani\u00e8re aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, je signale que, malgr\u00e9 les limites que comporte le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi, le sous-alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i) autorise tout de m\u00eame le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 un employeur d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement sp\u00e9ciaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 supprimer, diminuer ou pr\u00e9venir les d\u00e9savantages que subit un groupe d\u2019individus. De plus, le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi ne limite pas par ailleurs le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la prise de l\u2019une quelconque des autres mesures de redressement qui figurent aux alin\u00e9as 53(2)b) \u00e0 53(2)e) ou aux paragraphes 53(3) et 53(4) de la Loi.\n(Murray, au paragraphe 55.)\n[62] De plus, le pouvoir du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de redressement pr\u00e9vu par la Loi d\u00e9coule du paragraphe 53(2), qui pr\u00e9cise : \u00ab \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner [\u2026] \u00bb; en anglais : \u00ab If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order [\u2026] \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] Le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi s\u2019accorde \u00e9galement avec les mots cl\u00e9s du paragraphe 54.1(3) : \u00ab Le tribunal qui juge fond\u00e9e une plainte contre un employeur [\u2026] \u00bb; en anglais : \u00ab Where a Tribunal finds that a complaint against an employer is substantiated [\u2026] \u00bb. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.] \u00c0 mon avis, les termes soulign\u00e9s laissent entendre que le pouvoir du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de redressement n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la conclusion d\u2019une instruction, lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019examinerai si la mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e par la plaignante contrevient au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019instruction, en tenant compte de tous les arguments et de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties pendant l\u2019audience, seulement si la plainte est jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e.\n[63] Par cons\u00e9quent, comme elle est fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en radiation de la mesure de redressement inscrite au paragraphe 27, point no 10, de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante.\n[64] En ce qui a trait aux modifications propos\u00e9es aux mesures de redressement de la plaignante, compte tenu du diff\u00e9rend entre les parties et des pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en ce qui a trait au pr\u00e9judice, je crois que la fa\u00e7on la plus juste de proc\u00e9der est la suivante : la plaignante doit pr\u00e9senter un avis de requ\u00eate, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03\u201105\u201104) du Tribunal, afin de modifier sa plainte. Dans sa requ\u00eate, la plaignante peut \u00e9tablir le fondement des modifications qu\u2019elle propose et l\u2019intim\u00e9e aura ensuite l\u2019occasion d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre et d\u2019expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles les modifications propos\u00e9es la pr\u00e9occupent. En se fondant sur des observations d\u00e9taill\u00e9es des parties, le Tribunal aura alors tous les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il accepte les modifications.\nE. Le Tribunal devrait-il radier toutes les demandes de mesures de redressement post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte? [65] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, pour \u00e9tablir la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte, il est n\u00e9cessaire de tenir compte des trois plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la plaignante, y compris les deux plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par la Commission et qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal pour instruction. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante ne peut pas demander de mesures de redressement pour des p\u00e9riodes qui ne sont pas vis\u00e9es par la p\u00e9riode couverte par sa plainte initiale (du 22 f\u00e9vrier 1999 au 6 septembre 2006) et qui rel\u00e8vent des p\u00e9riodes couvertes par les plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles (du 10 septembre 2007 \u00e0 ce jour). En particulier, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient :\n[traduction]\nEn demandant ces mesures de redressement, la plaignante cherche, de fa\u00e7on inappropri\u00e9e, \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce des mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9es dans d\u2019autres plaintes qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal pour instruction. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une fa\u00e7on inacceptable de contourner le r\u00f4le de la Commission de gardienne de l\u2019acc\u00e8s au Tribunal et cela ne devrait pas \u00eatre permis. De plus, la demande de mesures de redressement pour des p\u00e9riodes qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es et \u00e9cart\u00e9es par la Commission est redondante et il s\u2019agit d\u2019un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Pour ces motifs, les demandes de mesures de redressement post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte devraient \u00eatre radi\u00e9es.\n(Observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (Requ\u00eate en radiation de parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, au paragraphe 68.)\n[66] La plaignante est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre restreinte par la p\u00e9riode couverte par les all\u00e9gations de sa plainte. Elle a d\u00e9crit les all\u00e9gations de sa plainte comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9occupation continue \u00bb et, par cons\u00e9quent, les mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle demande ne devraient pas \u00eatre restreintes par la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9cise au cours de laquelle les \u00e9v\u00e9nements sur lesquels la plainte est fond\u00e9e ont eu lieu.\n[67] La Commission a adopt\u00e9 une position semblable \u00e0 celle de la plaignante et ne souscrit pas \u00e0 la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[68] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le pouvoir du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de mesures de redressement n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 la conclusion d\u2019une instruction, lorsque la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e (voir le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi). De plus, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement en ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 des principes, en tenant compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 37). Autrement dit, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire ainsi qu\u2019aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 50).\n[69] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure, avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au sujet du bien\u2011fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de la plaignante, je ne vois aucun motif pour lequel je pourrais rejeter les demandes de mesures de redressement de la plaignante qui sont post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par sa plainte. On ne m\u2019a d\u2019ailleurs pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun fondement l\u00e9gal, que ce soit la Loi ou une autre source, qui restreint la p\u00e9riode pour laquelle un plaignant peut demander une mesure de redressement. Le fait que les plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es par la Commission n\u2019est pas un argument convaincant. Enfin, la plaignante doit encore \u00e9tablir un lien entre les actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et sa perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e. S\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien, et que les mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es ne sont li\u00e9es qu\u2019aux plaintes de repr\u00e9sailles, aucun redressement ne sera accord\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter ses observations \u00e0 ce sujet lors de l\u2019audience.\n[70] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en radiation de toutes les demandes de mesures de redressement post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante.\nF. Le Tribunal devrait-il rendre une ordonnance en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi? [71] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande une ordonnance conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi afin de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 des personnes qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la divulgation de renseignements personnels au public pourrait causer des difficult\u00e9s indues aux personnes qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte, dont la seule implication a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature pour les m\u00eames postes que ceux convoit\u00e9s par la plaignante.\n[72] Pendant l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, la plaignante et la Commission ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ne s\u2019opposaient pas \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[73] Comme les parties s\u2019entendent sur la question, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi, j\u2019ordonne :\nLes parties et leurs repr\u00e9sentants doivent assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de tous les renseignements au sujet de l\u2019identit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s actuels et des anciens employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec la plainte.\n[74] Pour garantir encore plus la confidentialit\u00e9, j\u2019ai assur\u00e9 les parties que, m\u00eame si les noms des personnes li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte pouvaient \u00eatre mentionn\u00e9s pendant l\u2019audience, ils n\u2019appara\u00eetraient pas dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, dans la mesure du possible.\nIV. Conclusion [75] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en radiation de parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante est rejet\u00e9e.\n[76] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant une ordonnance en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi est accueillie, conform\u00e9ment aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 73 ci-dessus.\nSign\u00e9e par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 8 mai 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1727\/8211\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Diane Carolyn Emmet c.

Les plaintes [1] Les plaignants, Jeremy et Mardy Matson ainsi que Melody Schneider, qui sont fr\u00e8res et s\u0153ur, ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 chacun une plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 [la Loi]. Ces plaintes visent Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9 \u00ab Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada \u00bb (l\u2019intim\u00e9).\n[2] Les plaignants disent \u00eatre victimes de discrimination du fait de leur race, de leur origine nationale ou ethnique, de leur sexe et de leur situation de famille, \u00e0 cause de la mani\u00e8re dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C., 1985, ch. I\u20115 [la Loi sur les Indiens]. Ils soutiennent qu\u2019en raison de leur ascendance indienne matrilin\u00e9aire, ils continuent d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente dans la mani\u00e8re dont ils sont inscrits aux termes du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, comparativement \u00e0 ceux dont la lign\u00e9e est paternelle et qui sont inscrits aux termes du paragraphe 6(1). C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits aux termes du paragraphe 6(2) ne leur permet pas de transmettre leur statut \u00e0 leurs enfants.\nII. Le contexte [3] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le Tribunal a eu l\u2019avantage de disposer d\u2019un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits. Si l\u2019on y ajoute les observations des parties, il est possible de r\u00e9sumer comme suit le contexte dans lequel s\u2019inscrivent les plaintes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es.\n[4] Les plaignants ont un seul grand-parent indien : une femme qui a perdu son statut en \u00e9pousant un non-Indien avant 1985 et qui l\u2019a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens au moment o\u00f9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e la Loi modifiant la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 32 (1er suppl.), en 1985. Par suite de ces m\u00eames modifications, les enfants issus de son mariage avec un non-Indien (dont l\u2019un \u00e9tait le p\u00e8re des plaignants, Eugene Matson) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme admissibles au statut aux termes du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les modifications apport\u00e9es en 1985 accordaient seulement \u00e0 leur p\u00e8re le statut pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(2) et que leur m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas indienne, les plaignants, au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leurs plaintes, n\u2019\u00e9taient admissibles \u00e0 aucun statut sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le paragraphe 6(2) de cette derni\u00e8re ne permet pas \u00e0 une personne de transmettre son statut aux enfants qu\u2019elle a avec un non-Indien. De ce fait, les enfants que les plaignants ont eu avec des non-Indiens depuis 1985 n\u2019ont pas droit eux non plus au statut.\n[5] En novembre et en d\u00e9cembre 2008, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. De pair avec ces plaintes, ils ont \u00e9tabli et produit un tableau qui d\u00e9crit l\u2019historique de leur famille et de leur statut, comparativement \u00e0 l\u2019historique d\u2019une famille hypoth\u00e9tique qui est identique \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, sauf pour ce qui est du sexe de leur grand-parent indien. Autrement dit, dans l\u2019historique de la famille hypoth\u00e9tique, le grand-parent indien est de sexe masculin, plut\u00f4t que f\u00e9minin. Toutes les dates de naissance, de mariage et de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sont les m\u00eames dans les deux sc\u00e9narios. Comme l\u2019illustre ce tableau, les plaignants, selon le sc\u00e9nario patrilin\u00e9aire hypoth\u00e9tique, auraient le statut que pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, et ils seraient donc en mesure de transmettre \u00e0 leurs enfants le statut pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 6(2).\n[6] Le 6 avril 2009, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire McIvor c. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153 [McIvor], d\u00e9clarant que les alin\u00e9as 6(1)a) et c) de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient nuls ou sans effet car ces deux dispositions violaient le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 que conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, ch. 11 [la Charte]. La Cour a jug\u00e9 que la violation ne pouvait pas se justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte. La d\u00e9claration a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an afin que le Parlement puisse examiner et prendre en consid\u00e9ration de nouvelles modifications \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[7] Le 9 novembre 2009, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la Loi, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal instruise les plaintes des plaignants. Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 40(4) de la Loi, elle a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne la tenue d\u2019une instruction commune car elle \u00e9tait convaincue que ces plaintes soulevaient pour l\u2019essentiel les m\u00eames questions de fait et de droit.\n[8] Le 2 novembre 2010, le Tribunal a ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019instance dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique avait prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 au Parlement pour se conformer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle avait rendue dans l\u2019affaire McIvor, et des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives \u00e9taient en instance devant le Parlement en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette mesure (voir le dossier 2010 TCDP 28).\n[9] Le 31 janvier 2011, la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens, L.C. 2010, ch. 18 [la LESIRI], est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. Cette derni\u00e8re a modifi\u00e9, notamment, les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription par l\u2019addition d\u2019un nouvel alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1), qui ajoute le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit pour certaines personnes dont la m\u00e8re avait perdu le statut en \u00e9pousant un non-Indien avant le 17 avril 1985.\n[10] Par suite de l\u2019adoption de la LESIRI, (i) Eugene Matson \u2013 le p\u00e8re des plaignants \u2013 a \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme admissible \u00e0 l\u2019inscription aux termes du nouvel alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et (ii) les plaignants ont obtenu le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[11] En mai et en juin 2011, les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens en application du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Ils ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que leurs enfants soient inscrits, mais le registraire des Indiens a conclu qu\u2019aucune disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens ne permettait l\u2019inscription d\u2019une personne dont l\u2019un des parents \u00e9tait inscrit en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) et l\u2019autre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un Indien au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[12] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019adoption de la LESIRI et de l\u2019inscription des plaignants en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, le 27 septembre 2011 le Tribunal a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait utile que l\u2019on produise des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s. Il a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si les plaintes relatives \u00e0 l\u2019inscription des plaignants sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient maintenant th\u00e9oriques puisque ces derniers \u00e9taient maintenant inscrits, la partie des plaintes qui avait trait \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de transmettre le statut aux enfants issus d\u2019un mariage avec un non\u2011Indien n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore r\u00e9gl\u00e9e (voir le dossier 2011 TCDP 14).\n[13] Le 19 janvier 2012, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de question constitutionnelle (AQC), dans laquelle ils ont dit vouloir contester la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens au regard de la Charte. La contestation relative \u00e0 la Charte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le fait que l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens contrevient aux articles 2 et 3 de la Loi ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019article premier et au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte, et qu\u2019il y aurait lieu de les faire annuler et de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019ils sont nuls et sans effet.\n[14] Le 30 juin 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance radiant la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019AQC des plaignants.\n[15] Le 6 septembre 2012, le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et a ordonn\u00e9 la radiation de la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019AQC des plaignants. Il a conclu que les plaignants, par l\u2019AQC, tentaient de faire trancher les m\u00eames faits que ceux qui contrevenaient cens\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi au regard de la Charte. Comme le paragraphe 50(2) de la Loi n\u2019accorde au Tribunal que le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit \u00ab dans les affaires dont il est saisi \u00bb, soit le fait de savoir si un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au sens des articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi, il a jug\u00e9 que la question constitutionnelle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e au fait de d\u00e9terminer si un acte discriminatoire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis au sens de la Loi. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question de droit tout \u00e0 fait distincte, non li\u00e9e au mandat que prescrit la Loi dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire (voir le dossier 2012 TCDP 19).\n[16] \u00c0 la suite de tout ce contexte proc\u00e9dural et de fond, le Tribunal a instruit la pr\u00e9sente affaire les 30 et 31 janvier 2013, \u00e0 Kelowna (Colombie-Britannique).\nIII. La disjonction de l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire [17] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5(3)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal, de m\u00eame qu\u2019avec le consentement des parties, l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire se d\u00e9roule en deux volets. L\u2019audition du premier volet de la plainte, les 30 et 31 janvier 2013, avait pour but de r\u00e9pondre aux questions suivantes :\n(a) La plainte est-elle une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre?\n(b) Le Tribunal est-il tenu de suivre la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 CAF 7, autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel devant la CSC rejet\u00e9e (34706) [Murphy] et de rejeter la plainte?\n(c) La plainte met-elle en cause un acte discriminatoire commis dans le cadre de la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public et susceptible de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une conclusion de discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue aux termes de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi?\n[18] Avant de passer au second volet de la plainte, je vais analyser les questions susmentionn\u00e9es.\nIV. Les positions des parties A. Les plaignants [19] Les plaignants sont d\u2019avis que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens est un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Ce service, soutiennent-ils, comporte le fait de d\u00e9terminer qui a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien et qui ne l\u2019a pas.\n[20] Selon les plaignants, l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien ne se fait pas automatiquement, car il faut en faire la demande. Cela consiste \u00e0 remplir un formulaire de demande, \u00e0 fournir des renseignements sur ses anc\u00eatres, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 produire des documents justificatifs. Ils soutiennent donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9 cr\u00e9e une relation de service entre lui et les personnes qui sollicitent le statut d\u2019Indien sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens et que, en raison de cette relation, l\u2019article 5 de la Loi s\u2019applique \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[21] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, les plaignants font valoir que la d\u00e9cision tente de limiter la port\u00e9e de la Loi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re contraire aux principes qu\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9s la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois sur les droits de la personne (Winnipeg School Division No 1 c. Craton, [1985] 2 RCS 150 [Craton]; CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 RCS 1114 [Action Travail des Femmes]; Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia, [1989] 1 RCS 143 [Andrews]; et Tranchemontagne c. Ontario (Directeur du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es), 2006 CSC 14 [Tranchemontagne]. De plus, ils sont d\u2019avis que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la doctrine du stare decisis, le Tribunal est tenu de se conformer \u00e0 ces arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et qu\u2019il ne devrait donc pas prendre en consid\u00e9ration la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Murphy.\n[22] Les plaignants sont d\u2019avis que la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il y a lieu de rejeter la plainte parce qu\u2019elle ne prend pas naissance dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, est incompatible avec le fait que le Canada est membre des Nations Unies ainsi qu\u2019avec les engagements que lui imposent la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme, R\u00e9s. AG 217 A(III), Doc. off. AGNU, 3e s\u00e9ance pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re, suppl. no 13, Doc. A\/810 (1948) 71, de m\u00eame que la D\u00e9claration des Nations Unies sur les droits des peuples autochtones, R\u00e9s. AG 61\/295, AGNU, 61e s\u00e9ance pl\u00e9ni\u00e8re, suppl. no 49, vol. III, Doc. A\/61\/49 (2007). Selon les plaignants, le Canada est tenu de se conformer \u00e0 ces engagements internationaux pour guider ses lois int\u00e9rieures, ses tribunaux et ses obligations envers ses citoyens.\n[23] Les plaignants ajoutent que le Canada a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelon interne \u00e0 ses engagements internationaux en abrogeant l\u2019article 67 de la Loi (projet de loi C\u201121, Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, 2e Session, 39e l\u00e9gislature, 2008 [le projet de loi C\u201121]). Le projet de loi C\u201121, \u00e0 l\u2019article 1.1, comprenait \u00e9galement la reconnaissance des droits existants \u2013 ancestraux ou issus de trait\u00e9s \u2013 et, \u00e0 l\u2019article 1.2, pr\u00e9voyait que le Tribunal devait tenir compte des traditions juridiques et des r\u00e8gles de droit coutumier des Premi\u00e8res Nations au moment d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter et d\u2019appliquer la Loi en rapport avec une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du gouvernement d\u2019une Premi\u00e8re Nation. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les plaignants, l\u2019intention et l\u2019objet qui sous\u2011tendaient l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67, ainsi que l\u2019inclusion des articles 1.1 et 1.2 dans le projet de loi C\u201121, \u00e9taient d\u2019ouvrir la Loi sur les Indiens dans son ensemble \u00e0 un examen complet en vertu de la Loi.\n[24] Sur ce fondement, les plaignants font \u00e9galement une distinction avec certaines des affaires sur lesquelles se fonde l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la th\u00e8se selon laquelle un texte de loi ne peut pas \u00eatre contest\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi, soit Forward c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2008 TCDP 5 [Forward], Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. McKenna, [1999] 1 CF 401 [McKenna] et Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bouvier, 1998 CanLII 7409 (CAF) [Bouvier]. Selon les plaignants, l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 est le facteur distinctif entre les plaintes dont il est ici question et ces affaires, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es avant l\u2019abrogation.\n[25] Enfin, les plaignants soutiennent qu\u2019il faut instruire les plaintes \u00e0 cause de leur effet public consid\u00e9rable. \u00c0 leur avis, les modifications qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adoption de la LESIRI n\u2019ont pas redress\u00e9 ou rectifi\u00e9 la distinction qui existe entre les descendants d\u2019Indiennes et d\u2019Indiens. Tant avant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019adoption de la LESIRI, la Loi sur les Indiens ne leur accorde pas le statut conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par le paragraphe 6(1), comme cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas dans leur sc\u00e9nario patrilin\u00e9aire comparatif hypoth\u00e9tique. Cela \u00e9tant, il leur est toujours impossible de transmettre leur statut aux enfants qu\u2019ils ont avec des non-Indiens.\n[26] Selon les plaignants, le l\u00e9gislateur a eu la possibilit\u00e9 de traiter de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe dans la LESIRI, mais a rejet\u00e9 une modification propos\u00e9e par le Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du d\u00e9veloppement du Grand Nord de la Chambre des communes, qui aurait pr\u00e9vu que \u00ab [\u2026] toute personne n\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le 17 avril 1985 et qui est un descendant direct d\u2019une personne inscrite ou ayant le droit de l\u2019\u00eatre aux termes de la Loi sur les Indiens a elle aussi le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite \u00bb (Biblioth\u00e8que du Parlement, R\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u00e9gislatif du projet de loi C\u20113 : Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens, par Mary C. Hurley et Tonina Simeone, Division des affaires sociales, Service d\u2019information et de recherche parlementaires (Ottawa : Biblioth\u00e8que du Parlement, 2010), \u00e0 la p. 1). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que cette modification outrepassait la port\u00e9e du projet de loi et \u00e9tait donc irrecevable (R\u00e9sum\u00e9 l\u00e9gislatif du projet de loi C\u20113 : Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens, \u00e0 la p. 1).\n[27] Les plaignants d\u00e9clarent que l\u2019on peut estimer le nombre total de personnes susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre touch\u00e9es par la plainte (les petits-enfants de lign\u00e9e maternelle et leurs enfants) \u00e0 un chiffre variant entre 108 000 et 130 500.\nB. La Commission [28] La Commission est d\u2019avis que la plainte n\u2019est pas une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi. Elle vise le fait que l\u2019on applique les dispositions d\u2019inscription discriminatoires de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 des membres du public. Elle convient toutefois que la disposition contest\u00e9e a oblig\u00e9 les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 arriver aux conclusions qu\u2019ils ont tir\u00e9es \u00e0 propos du droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription des plaignants.\n[29] Selon la Commission, le fait de d\u00e9terminer le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription est un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi : l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien comporte des avantages tangibles et intangibles et elle est offerte au public en ce sens, dans le contexte d\u2019une relation publique. Par ailleurs, les personnes souhaitant \u00eatre inscrites sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens sont tenues de pr\u00e9senter une demande au Bureau du registraire des Indiens.\n[30] Cela dit, la Commission soutient \u00e9galement que la Loi autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes contestant l\u2019effet discriminatoire d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Elle fait valoir qu\u2019il ressort de la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada que les lois sur les droits de la personne rendent inop\u00e9rantes les lois incompatibles (Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 RCS 145 [Heerspink]; Craton; Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al, 2004 CSC 30 [Larocque]; et Tranchemontagne). D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission, lorsqu\u2019il existe un conflit entre une loi sur les droits de la personne et une autre texte de loi, c\u2019est la loi sur les droits de la personne qui prime en tant qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 de principes quasi constitutionnel et elle a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur tout texte de loi incompatible, sauf si le l\u00e9gislateur a clairement indiqu\u00e9 le contraire en des termes explicites et non \u00e9quivoques. La Commission soutient que, dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal doit tenir d\u00fbment compte de ce que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019effet et du statut des lois sur les droits de la personne.\n[31] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, la Commission reconna\u00eet que cette d\u00e9cision, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, r\u00e9pondrait de mani\u00e8re compl\u00e8te aux plaintes dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, lesquelles visent une conduite gouvernementale qui \u00e9tait obligatoire aux termes des dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens. Cependant, elle soutient qu\u2019avant la d\u00e9cision Murphy, une longue s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles rendues dans le cadre du syst\u00e8me f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des droits de la personne avaient reconnu que la Loi avait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur d\u2019autres textes de loi incompatibles, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans des affaires telles que Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne; (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Druken, [1989] 2 CF 24 (C.A.) [Druken (CAF)]; Gonzalez c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration), [1997] 3 CF 646 [Gonzalez]; McAllister-Windsor c. Canada (D\u00e9veloppement des ressources humaines), 2001 CanLII 20691 (TCDP) [McAllister-Windsor]; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 CF 569 [Uzoaba]; les motifs dissidents du juge en chef Dickson et du juge Lamer dans Bhinder c. CN, [1985] 2 RCS 561 [Bhinder]; de m\u00eame que les motifs dissidents de la juge McLachlin et de la juge L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 dans Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 RCS 854 [Cooper]).\n[32] Selon la Commission, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, la Cour n\u2019a pas appliqu\u00e9 sa propre jurisprudence d\u00e9crivant les circonstances restreintes dans lesquelles il convient qu\u2019une formation infirme la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019une autre formation a rendue ant\u00e9rieurement. Par ailleurs, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 d\u2019arr\u00eats jurisprudentiels contraires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, comme Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne, ou n\u2019en a pas fait mention. Dans les circonstances, le Tribunal est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 deux courants jurisprudentiels contradictoires, \u00e9manant de d\u00e9cideurs d\u2019instance sup\u00e9rieure. La Commission soutient que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes du stare decisis vertical, le Tribunal est tenu de suivre les principes qu\u2019a \u00e9tablis la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Elle ajoute que, m\u00eame si la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rejet\u00e9 une demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019interjeter appel de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, cela ne veut pas dire qu\u2019elle souscrivait \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019instance inf\u00e9rieure.\n[33] Aux dires de la Commission, le fait de suivre les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada garantirait aussi que la jurisprudence du Tribunal concorde avec d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions de tribunaux des droits de la personne et de cours de justice du pays tout entier qui ont conclu que des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives discriminatoires \u00e9taient inop\u00e9rantes.\n[34] La Commission souligne par ailleurs que le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif de plusieurs dispositions actuellement en vigueur de la Loi illustrent l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux : l\u2019article 2 ainsi que les paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1). \u00c0 son avis, la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019absence de tautologie prescrit que le l\u00e9gislateur ne s\u2019est pas exprim\u00e9 en vain quand il a adopt\u00e9 les paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1) de la Loi et que l\u2019application de la Loi au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux \u00e9tait donc l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait le l\u00e9gislateur. La Commission signale que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans le cadre de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, n\u2019a pas fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 2, pas plus qu\u2019aux paragraphes 49(5) ou 62(1).\n[35] La Commission attire \u00e9galement l\u2019attention sur le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif de l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi. Selon elle, cette disposition agissait comme une exception l\u00e9gislative au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral selon lequel les lois sur les droits de la personne ont pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance. L\u2019existence de cet article signifiait que, sans l\u2019exception, la Loi se serait appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle disposition discriminatoire de la Loi sur les Indiens. En fait, le l\u00e9gislateur aurait adopt\u00e9 l\u2019ancien article 67 dans le but de mettre \u00e0 l\u2019abri les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens contre toute r\u00e9vision en vertu de la Loi. C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019en abrogeant l\u2019article 67 en 2008, le l\u00e9gislateur entendait donner ouverture \u00e0 des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne qui contesteraient les aspects discriminatoires de ces m\u00eames dispositions.\n[36] Une fois de plus, la Commission fait valoir que la pr\u00e9somption d\u2019absence de tautologie existe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019article 67 et de son abrogation, et que la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir que les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens ne peuvent pas \u00eatre contest\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi, viole cette pr\u00e9somption. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, le Tribunal se doit d\u2019admettre que l\u2019octroi du statut d\u2019Indien fait partie des \u00ab services [\u2026] destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\nC. L\u2019intim\u00e9 [37] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que, dans le cas de n\u2019importe quelle plainte, il est crucial que le Tribunal en saisisse et en caract\u00e9rise convenablement l\u2019objet. Selon lui, dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Commission et les plaignants tentent de qualifier la plainte de mesure mettant en cause la mani\u00e8re dont les agents du Bureau du registraire des Indiens examinent et traitent les demandes d\u2019inscription, le Tribunal se doit de rejeter une telle qualification. Les arguments invoqu\u00e9s et les preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui ne sont pas ax\u00e9s sur la conduite d\u2019agents du Bureau du registraire des Indiens, sur l\u2019exercice de pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires ou sur la mise en \u0153uvre de lignes de conduite minist\u00e9rielles. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, en examinant les demandes d\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien des plaignants, les agents n\u2019ont rien fait de plus qu\u2019appliquer des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux cat\u00e9goriques \u00e0 des faits incontest\u00e9s. Les plaintes visent donc uniquement une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et rien d\u2019autre.\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne \u00e9galement la position des plaignants au sujet des changements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adoption de la LESIRI. Selon lui, le fait qu\u2019une modification l\u00e9gislative aurait peut-\u00eatre pu r\u00e9gler la plainte, et non un changement de politique ou d\u2019autres facteurs, est un signe de plus que les plaintes dont il est ici question ont trait \u00e0 un texte de loi. Par ailleurs, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce un avis de question constitutionnelle (AQC) qui conteste la validit\u00e9 constitutionnelle de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Dans cet avis, ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Le projet de loi C\u20113 n\u2019a pas rem\u00e9di\u00e9 comme il faut \u00e0 la discrimination jug\u00e9e inconstitutionnels dans McIvor. \u00bb De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un autre exemple montrant que les plaintes sont fond\u00e9es sur le libell\u00e9 d\u2019un texte de loi.\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, par suite de l\u2019application de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, ainsi que d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions telles que Forward, McKenna et Bouvier, il y aurait lieu de rejeter les plaintes. Ces d\u00e9cisions indiquent que la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre un texte de loi.\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, par opposition aux arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qu\u2019invoquent les plaignants et la Commission, la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy portait sp\u00e9cifiquement sur la Loi et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tait. Il ajoute que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de dispositions l\u00e9gales particuli\u00e8res de la Loi par un tribunal d\u2019instance sup\u00e9rieure a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur une preuve d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative extrins\u00e8que, comme les sources que la Commission met de l\u2019avant. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, toujours selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il n\u2019est pas loisible au Tribunal d\u2019infirmer une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en raison de la doctrine du stare decisis et aussi parce qu\u2019il serait erron\u00e9 de la part du Tribunal d\u2019agir ainsi.\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9tend que m\u00eame si la Loi pr\u00e9voyait effectivement la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cette plainte serait tout de m\u00eame rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle ne met pas en cause un \u00ab service \u00bb. Suivant le raisonnement que le Tribunal a formul\u00e9 dans Forward, l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien est : (i) un statut distinct accord\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat qui a (ii) des dimensions constitutionnelles et (iii) le fait de le qualifier de simple service serait faire abstraction du r\u00f4le fondamental qu\u2019il joue dans la d\u00e9finition de la relation entre des individus et l\u2019\u00c9tat. De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9, m\u00eame si le traitement de demandes d\u2019inscription peut \u00eatre un \u00ab service \u00bb, le crit\u00e8re qu\u2019applique le l\u00e9gislateur pour identifier la population jouissant de cette relation ne l\u2019est pas. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative du mot \u00ab services \u00bb, si l\u2019on donne \u00e0 ce dernier son sens ordinaire et si on l\u2019interpr\u00e8te de pair avec le reste de l\u2019article 5 et l\u2019\u00e9conomie tout enti\u00e8re de la Loi, am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription n\u2019est pas un service.\n[42] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient \u00e9galement que la position de la Commission est vici\u00e9e, vu la port\u00e9e du cadre analytique de la Loi. S\u2019il fallait que le Tribunal admette qu\u2019il existe un \u00ab service \u00bb dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, cela obligerait le gouvernement \u00e0 justifier sa loi sur le fondement d\u2019un \u00ab accommodement raisonnable \u00bb au point d\u2019en subir une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb, et restreint par le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi \u00e0 des questions \u00ab en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, les dispositions l\u00e9gales en litige sont le fruit de plusieurs ann\u00e9es \u00e9tudes, de d\u00e9bats et de consultations avec des groupes autochtones. Elles sont un compromis \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 entre des int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s et elles tiennent compte de facteurs d\u00e9mographiques et historiques complexes. Les questions relatives \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne font pas partie de ces facteurs. Cela ne laisse qu\u2019un seul aspect possible : les co\u00fbts. Aux dires de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il faut h\u00e9siter \u00e0 faire valoir une justification de contrainte financi\u00e8re excessive en raison de sa nature r\u00e9ductrice et d\u00e9shumanisante et du fait que des facteurs non p\u00e9cuniaires ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important et puissant dans le choix qu\u2019a fait le l\u00e9gislateur de d\u00e9limiter qui est un Indien inscrit.\n[43] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ajoute que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alberta c. Hutterian Brethren of Wilson Colony, 2009 CSC 37 [Hutterian Brethren], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada pr\u00e9cise que la norme de l\u2019accommodement raisonnable ne convient pas pour \u00e9valuer les lois d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et qu\u2019elle n\u2019est utile que dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019on conteste une action gouvernementale ou une pratique administrative. Contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument des plaignants et de la Commission selon lequel l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy ne cadre pas avec la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019arr\u00eat Hutterian Brethren \u00e9taye la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, \u00e0 savoir que la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une plainte ax\u00e9e exclusivement sur une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[44] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Loi n\u2019a donc pas la port\u00e9e requise pour \u00e9valuer convenablement certains types de d\u00e9cisions et d\u2019actions gouvernementales. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le gouvernement a le droit de justifier la loi non pas en faisant \u00e9tat d\u2019un accommodement raisonnable, mais au moyen d\u2019une analyse fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\nV. Analyse A. La plainte est-elle une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre? [45] L\u2019article 5 de la Loi dispose :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[46] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir lorsqu\u2019on applique l\u2019article 5 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les actes reproch\u00e9s concernent un \u00ab fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement \u00bb (voir Watkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2008 CAF 170, au paragraphe 31 [Watkin]). Selon les plaignants et la Commission, les actes reproch\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont eu lieu dans le cadre de la fourniture de \u00ab services \u00bb. Selon l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, les \u00ab services \u00bb \u00ab [\u2026] s\u2019entendent de quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \u201coffert\u201d ou \u201cmis \u00e0 la disposition\u201d du public \u00bb (Watkin, au paragraphe 31). Ni les plaignants ni la Commission n\u2019ont trouv\u00e9 \u00e0 redire au crit\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral que l\u2019on emploie actuellement pour d\u00e9terminer si une conduite concerne un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[47] En revanche, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne vise pas la fourniture de \u00ab services \u00bb quelconques; il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une stricte contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, la Loi sur les Indiens. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que \u00ab la [Loi] ne pr\u00e9voit pas la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser de plaintes contre une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [\u2026] \u00bb (au paragraphe 6). Se fondant sur la d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Forward, sur le paragraphe 40(1) (\u00ab [\u2026] qui autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes [\u2026] \u00bb) ainsi que sur les articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi (qui \u00ab [\u2026] qui d\u00e9finissent les \u201cactes discriminatoires\u201d pouvant faire l\u2019objet de celles-ci [\u2026] \u00bb), la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les contestations qui \u00ab [\u2026] [visent] les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en soi et rien d\u2019autre \u00bb \u00e9chappent \u00ab [\u2026] au champ d\u2019application de la [Loi] [\u2026] \u00bb (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, au paragraphe 6). Se reportant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Wignall c. Canada (Ministre du Revenu national), 2003 CF 1280, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 : \u00ab l\u2019opposition en vertu de la [Loi] \u00e0 l\u2019application [des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives] \u00e9tait vou\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec si elle se fondait seulement sur ses cons\u00e9quences suppos\u00e9es discriminatoires pour le plaignant : seule une contestation de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de cette disposition offrait des chances de succ\u00e8s \u00bb (Murphy, au paragraphe 6).\n[48] C\u2019est dans le contexte qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que le Tribunal cherche \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la plainte dont il est question en l'esp\u00e8ce est une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, ou si ce que l\u2019on conteste est un acte discriminatoire commis dans le cadre de la fourniture de services, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[49] Dans son formulaire de plainte, dat\u00e9 du 25 novembre 2008, Jeremy Matson d\u00e9crit sa plainte en ces termes :\n[traduction]\nJe crois que la [r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion de la 2e g\u00e9n\u00e9ration] qui d\u00e9coule du projet de loi C\u201131 est discriminatoire \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 celui de mon fr\u00e8re et de ma s\u0153ur, en raison des motifs de distinction illicite que sont la situation de famille et le sexe aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en ce sens que le projet de loi C\u201131 continue de faire une distinction et d\u2019exercer une discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des descendants d\u2019Indiennes qui ont \u00e9pous\u00e9 un non-Indien en limitant l\u2019extension du droit au statut \u00e0 un certain niveau de filiation qui ne s\u2019appliquerait pas aux Indiens de sexe masculin de m\u00eame ascendance.\nPour clarifier les choses, si ma grand-m\u00e8re avait \u00e9pous\u00e9 un Indien, elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de ses droits, et tant mon p\u00e8re que moi-m\u00eame aurions eu droit au plein statut \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens.\n(\u00c0 la p. 3.)\n[50] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019adoption de la LESIRI et de l\u2019inscription des plaignants en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, les plaignants ont r\u00e9vis\u00e9 leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.

L\u2019essence de cette plainte, selon moi, est que les plaignants estiment que l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens doit \u00eatre modifi\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au projet de modification qu\u2019a rejet\u00e9 le Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du d\u00e9veloppement du Grand Nord, d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 26 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de. En fait, les plaignants l\u2019ont eux-m\u00eames admis, ainsi qu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 dans les extraits d\u2019audience aux paragraphes 52 et 53 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. Les crit\u00e8res qui donnent droit \u00e0 une personne d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite, ou non inscrite, \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens ne sont pas un service. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un texte de loi que le Parlement a adopt\u00e9. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, un texte de loi n\u2019est pas un service.\n[55] M\u00eame si la Commission qualifie la plainte de contestation du fait d\u2019appliquer les dispositions d\u2019inscription discriminatoires de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 des membres du public, elle convient \u00e9galement que les dispositions contest\u00e9es obligeaient les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 arriver aux conclusions qu\u2019ils ont tir\u00e9es au sujet des droits des plaignants. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette mani\u00e8re de qualifier la plainte. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et les arguments invoqu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ax\u00e9s sur un acte r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible quelconque de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t sur le pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 effet discriminatoire des dispositions en mati\u00e8re de droit de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[56] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec la d\u00e9termination des crit\u00e8res \u00e0 remplir pour avoir le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit, ou non, \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il n\u2019a pas non plus de pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires pour ce qui est de d\u00e9terminer le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit, ou non, \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien conform\u00e9ment aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Ce droit a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur, et non par l\u2019intim\u00e9, par l\u2019entremise de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens; et l\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de se conformer \u00e0 cette disposition lors du traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription. C\u2019est ce qui ressort clairement des articles 2 et 5 de la Loi sur les Indiens :\n2. (1) Les d\u00e9finitions qui suivent s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi, [\u2026]\n\u00ab Indien \u00bb Personne qui, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi, est inscrite \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien ou a droit de l\u2019\u00eatre.\n\u00ab registraire \u00bb Le fonctionnaire du minist\u00e8re responsable du registre des Indiens et des listes de bande tenu au minist\u00e8re.\n[\u2026]\n5 (1) Est tenu au minist\u00e8re un registre des Indiens o\u00f9 est consign\u00e9 le nom de chaque personne ayant le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite comme Indien en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n(2) Les noms figurant au registre des Indiens le 16 avril 1985 constituent le registre des Indiens au 17 avril 1985.\n(3) Le registraire peut ajouter au registre des Indiens, ou en retrancher, le nom de la personne qui, aux termes de la pr\u00e9sente loi, a ou n\u2019a pas droit, selon le cas, \u00e0 l\u2019inclusion de son nom dans ce registre.\n(4) Le registre des Indiens indique la date o\u00f9 chaque nom y a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 ou en a \u00e9t\u00e9 retranch\u00e9.\n(5) Il n\u2019est pas requis que le nom d\u2019une personne qui a le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite soit consign\u00e9 dans le registre des Indiens, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au registraire.\n[57] Comme le pr\u00e9cisent la d\u00e9finition d\u2019un \u00ab Indien \u00bb et le paragraphe 5(5) de la Loi sur les Indiens, le droit et l\u2019inscription sont deux choses distinctes. Le droit est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 au pr\u00e9alable par la Loi sur les Indiens, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019inscription; tandis que l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens est le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un processus de demande aupr\u00e8s du registraire\/minist\u00e8re.\n[58] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019offre pas au public l\u2019avantage d\u2019un droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, ni les avantages tangibles et intangibles correspondants dont un tel droit peut \u00eatre assorti. C\u2019est la Loi sur les Indiens elle-m\u00eame qui offre l\u2019avantage du droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription et c\u2019est le l\u00e9gislateur qui a appliqu\u00e9 au public les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re de droit, pas l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce que ce dernier peut offrir en tant qu\u2019avantage ou service au public est le traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription en vue de d\u00e9terminer si une personne doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e au registre des Indiens, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens. Pour ce faire, le registraire des Indiens re\u00e7oit les demandes d\u2019inscription, passe en revue les renseignements inscrits dans les demandes en vue de d\u00e9terminer s'ils sont complets et exacts, et \u00e9value ensuite les demandes afin de d\u00e9cider si le requ\u00e9rant satisfait aux dispositions de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens en mati\u00e8re de droit d\u2019inscription. Les plaignants ne se plaignent pas de discrimination dans le cadre de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution, par l\u2019intim\u00e9, de l\u2019une quelconque de ces fonctions. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, le r\u00e9sultat de ce processus est le suivant : soit le requ\u00e9rant est ajout\u00e9 au registre des Indiens comme ayant droit au statut d\u2019Indien sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens, soit il ne l\u2019est pas. Le traitement d\u2019une demande par le registraire, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite ci-dessus, est peut-\u00eatre un service, mais pas le statut, ou l\u2019absence de statut, qui en r\u00e9sulte.\n[59] Comme l\u2019indiquent clairement les observations des plaignants, ce n\u2019est pas la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 traite les demandes des plaignants que l\u2019on conteste en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t le droit des plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019inscription, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. L\u2019unique source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. En passant en revue les demandes d\u2019inscriptions des plaignants, les agents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019ont rien fait de plus qu\u2019appliquer des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatifs cat\u00e9goriques \u00e0 des faits non contest\u00e9s. Toute contestation relative au processus d\u2019examen des demandes est en fait une contestation qui vise l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[60] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je r\u00e9pondrais donc \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question par l\u2019affirmative, et je conclus que la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, soit l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et rien d\u2019autre.\nB. Le Tribunal est-il tenu de suivre la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Murphy et de rejeter la plainte? [61] Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est une contestation de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et rien d\u2019autre, le raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019il faudrait rejeter la plainte parce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9borde du cadre de la Loi. Cependant, les plaignants et la Commission soutiennent que l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy est supplant\u00e9 par des arr\u00eats jurisprudentiels de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, lesquels concluent que la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne rend inop\u00e9rants les textes de loi incompatibles. Sur ce fondement, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la Loi donne ouverture aux plaintes contestant l\u2019effet discriminatoire d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et que, de ce fait, le Tribunal devrait s\u2019abstenir d\u2019appliquer l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy.\n[62] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argument, la Commission fait \u00e9galement \u00e9tat de d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles rendues au sein du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de protection des droits de la personne, qui, soutient-elle, reconnaissent que la Loi a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur d\u2019autres lois incompatibles. De plus, le fait de suivre la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ferait concorder celle du Tribunal avec d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions de tribunaux administratifs des droits de la personne et de cours de justice du pays tout entier, qui ont conclu que des dispositions l\u00e9gales discriminatoires \u00e9taient inop\u00e9rantes.\n[63] En outre, la Commission est d\u2019avis que les dispositions actuelles de la Loi montrent que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait que cette derni\u00e8re s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. De plus, tant les plaignants que la Commission soutiennent qu\u2019en abrogeant l\u2019article 67 de la Loi, le l\u00e9gislateur entendait donner ouverture aux plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne qui visaient des aspects discriminatoires de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[64] J\u2019examinerai chacun de ces arguments \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le.\n(i) La jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne [65] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qu\u2019invoquent les plaignants et la Commission sont les suivants : Heerspink, Craton, Action Travail des Femmes, Andrews, Larocque, et Tranchemontagne.\nHeerspink [66] L\u2019Insurance Corporation of British Columbia a mis fin, sans motif, \u00e0 l\u2019assurance des immeubles de M.

Aux termes de l\u2019article 208 de l\u2019Insurance Act de la Colombie-Britannique, l\u2019Insurance Corporation pouvait r\u00e9silier le contrat apr\u00e8s avoir signifi\u00e9 l\u2019avis requis. M. Heerspink avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 3 du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique, all\u00e9guant que l\u2019assurance avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e sans cause raisonnable. L\u2019article 3 pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019il fallait une cause raisonnable pour priver une personne ou une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes d\u2019un service habituellement offert au public. Une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate avait conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu violation du Human Rights Code.\n[67] Le juge en chef Laskin et les juges Ritchie et Dickson (tel \u00e9tait alors leur titre) ont souscrit \u00e0 la conclusion de la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Le juge Lamer, s\u2019exprimant aussi au nom des juges Estey et McIntyre (tel \u00e9tait alors leur titre) a souscrit aux motifs du juge Ritchie, mais il a ajout\u00e9 les commentaires suivants :\nLorsque l\u2019objet d\u2019une loi est d\u00e9crit comme l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 complet des \u00ab droits \u00bb des gens qui vivent sur un territoire donn\u00e9, il n\u2019y a pas de doute, selon moi, que ces gens ont, par l\u2019entremise de leur l\u00e9gislateur, clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils consid\u00e8rent que cette loi et les valeurs qu\u2019elle tend \u00e0 promouvoir et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger, sont, hormis les dispositions constitutionnelles, plus importantes que toutes les autres. En cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 moins que le l\u00e9gislateur ne se soit exprim\u00e9 autrement en termes clairs et expr\u00e8s dans le Code ou dans toute autre loi, il a voulu que le Code ait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur toutes les autres lois lorsqu\u2019il y a conflit.\nEn cons\u00e9quence, la maxime juridique generalia specialibus non derogant ne peut s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 un tel code. En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, si le Human Rights Code entre en conflit avec \u00ab des lois particuli\u00e8res et sp\u00e9cifiques \u00bb, il ne faut pas le consid\u00e9rer comme n\u2019importe quelle autre loi d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut le reconna\u00eetre pour ce qu\u2019il est, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une loi fondamentale.\nDe plus, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de droit public et de droit fondamental, personne ne peut, par contrat, \u00e0 moins que la loi ne l\u2019y autorise express\u00e9ment, convenir d\u2019en \u00e9carter l\u2019application et se soustraire ainsi \u00e0 son champ de protection.\nDonc, tout en \u00e9tant d\u2019accord avec mon coll\u00e8gue le juge Ritchie que \u00ab les deux dispositions l\u00e9gislatives en cause peuvent coexister puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 directe entre elles \u00bb, j\u2019ajouterai que, e\u00fbt-il eu incompatibilit\u00e9, le Code e\u00fbt d\u00fb pr\u00e9valoir. Je ne vois nulle part dans les lois de la Colombie-Britannique que l\u2019art. 5 des clauses l\u00e9gales \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019art. 208 de l\u2019Insurance Act, R.S.B.C. 1960, chap. 197, et modifications, doit recevoir une application sp\u00e9ciale en vertu du Human Rights Code.\n(Heerspink, aux pages 157 et 158.)\n[68] Ces commentaires traitent du conflit entre les lois sur les droits de la personne et des \u00ab lois particuli\u00e8res et sp\u00e9cifiques \u00bb. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les deux textes de loi pouvaient coexister; mais, a-t-elle indiqu\u00e9, dans le cas contraire, la loi sur les droits de la personne aurait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance. Cependant, par opposition aux plaintes des Matson, la plainte de M. Heerspink ne visait pas l\u2019Insurance Act elle-m\u00eame, mais le fait d\u2019\u00eatre priv\u00e9 d\u2019une assurance, en tant que service : \u00ab [j]e ne puis voir de motif pour lequel le l\u00e9gislateur aurait voulu que l\u2019assurance ne f\u00fbt pas un \u201cservice\u201d selon le sens que prend ce terme \u00e0 l\u2019art. 3 du Code \u00bb (Heerspink, \u00e0 la page 159). Il ne ressort pas non plus des commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame qu\u2019une plainte contestant un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne. La plainte de M. Heerspink reposait sur le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, ce qui \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 du Human Rights Code. Le conflit potentiel entre les deux lois n\u2019avait pris naissance qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 l\u2019Insurance Corporation avait fait valoir qu\u2019elle avait le droit de r\u00e9silier une assurance, sans cause raisonnable, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 208 de l\u2019Insurance Act.\nCraton [69] Au Manitoba, la Public Schools Act (aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9e, en fran\u00e7ais, la Loi sur les \u00e9coles publiques) permettait de fixer, pour les enseignants, un \u00e2ge de retraite obligatoire. Mme Craton, une enseignante, \u00e9tait tenue par sa convention collective de prendre sa retraite apr\u00e8s son soixante-cinqui\u00e8me anniversaire de naissance. Elle avait obtenu de la Cour du Banc de la Reine un jugement d\u00e9clarant que la retraite obligatoire contrevenait au paragraphe 6(1) de la Human Rights Act (aujourd\u2019hui appel\u00e9e, en fran\u00e7ais, le Code des droits de la personne) du Manitoba et \u00e9tait invalide, et qu\u2019on ne pouvait donc pas mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi. Le texte du paragraphe 6(1) de la Human Rights Act qui \u00e9tait en vigueur \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque est le suivant :\n[traduction]\n6 (1) Toute personne a droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances fond\u00e9e sur les exigences r\u00e9elles relatives \u00e0 son occupation ou emploi, ou \u00e0 sa formation en vue d\u2019un emploi, ou \u00e0 une occupation, \u00e0 un emploi, \u00e0 un avancement ou \u00e0 une promotion qu\u2019elle a en vue, et relatives \u00e0 son adh\u00e9sion ou projet d\u2019adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 un syndicat, \u00e0 une organisation patronale ou \u00e0 une association professionnelle; et, sans limiter la g\u00e9n\u00e9ralit\u00e9 de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de,\na) aucun employeur ni aucune personne agissant au nom d\u2019un employeur ne doit refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer ou de former cette personne en vue d\u2019un emploi, ou de lui donner de l\u2019avancement ou une promotion, ni ne peut lui faire subir de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son emploi ou de ses conditions d\u2019emploi;\n[\u2026]\nen raison de sa race, de sa nationalit\u00e9, de sa religion, de sa couleur, de son sexe, de son \u00e2ge, de son \u00e9tat matrimonial, d\u2019un handicap physique ou mental, de son origine ethnique ou nationale, de ses convictions politiques ou de sa situation familiale.\n[70] La question soumise \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tait le conflit entre les dispositions de la Human Rights Act et celles de la Public Schools Act, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e avant et refondue apr\u00e8s la Human Rights Act. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu que l\u2019on ne pouvait pas consid\u00e9rer la Public Schools Act comme un texte ult\u00e9rieur qui avait pour effet de cr\u00e9er une exception aux dispositions de la Human Rights Act. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment :\nUne loi sur les droits de la personne est de nature sp\u00e9ciale et \u00e9nonce une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale applicable \u00e0 des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Elle n\u2019est pas de nature constitutionnelle, en ce sens qu\u2019elle ne peut pas \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e, r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ou abrog\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature. Elle est cependant d\u2019une nature telle que seule une d\u00e9claration l\u00e9gislative claire peut permettre de la modifier, de la r\u00e9viser ou de l\u2019abroger, ou encore de cr\u00e9er des exceptions \u00e0 ses dispositions. Adopter et appliquer une th\u00e9orie quelconque d\u2019abrogation implicite d\u2019une loi de ce genre au moyen d\u2019un texte l\u00e9gislatif ult\u00e9rieur \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 la d\u00e9pouiller de sa nature sp\u00e9ciale et \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger fort inad\u00e9quatement les droits qu\u2019elle proclame. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on ne peut pas dire que l\u2019art. 50 de la refonte de 1980 est une indication suffisamment explicite de l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de cr\u00e9er une exception aux dispositions du par. 6(1) de The Human Rights Act.\n(Craton, \u00e0 la page 156)\n[71] M\u00eame si, dans Craton, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu qu\u2019il y avait un conflit entre la loi sur les droits de la personne et la Public Schools Act et que cette derni\u00e8re ne cr\u00e9ait pas d\u2019exception \u00e0 la Human Rights Act, cette conclusion est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en fonction des dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)a) de la Human Rights Act. L\u2019action de Mme Craton reposait non pas sur le conflit entre l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)a) et la Public Schools Act, mais sur le fait que son employeur refusait de la garder \u00e0 son service du fait de son \u00e2ge, ce qui \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)a). Le conflit entre les deux lois n\u2019avait pris naissance qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la Winnipeg School Division avait fait valoir qu\u2019elle avait le droit de faire appliquer la r\u00e8gle de la retraite obligatoire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Public Schools Act. L\u00e0 encore, comme dans le cas de l\u2019arr\u00eat Heerspink, les commentaires que la Cour supr\u00eame a formul\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Craton ne d\u00e9notent pas qu\u2019une plainte contre un texte l\u00e9gislatif, et rien d\u2019autre, peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la loi applicable, \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00e9sente.\nAction Travail des Femmes [72] Action Travail des Femmes all\u00e9guait que la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (CN) \u00e9tait coupable d\u2019actes discriminatoires en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche et de promotion, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de l\u2019ancienne Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, S.C. 1976-1977, ch. 33, car elle refusait aux femmes la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019occuper certains emplois manuels non sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s. Une formation du Tribunal des droits de la personne avait conclu que les politiques de recrutement, d\u2019embauche et de promotion du CN emp\u00eachaient et d\u00e9courageaient les femmes d\u2019occuper des emplois manuels. Le Tribunal avait impos\u00e9 au CN un programme sp\u00e9cial d\u2019emploi, comprenant l\u2019obligation d\u2019augmenter \u00e0 13 % la proportion de femmes travaillant dans des m\u00e9tiers non traditionnels et, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ce but soit atteint, d\u2019embaucher au moins une femme sur quatre postes non traditionnels \u00e0 combler \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[73] Devant la Cour supr\u00eame, l\u2019appel consistait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si le Tribunal \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9, aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) de l\u2019ancienne Loi, \u00e0 imposer \u00e0 un employeur un \u00ab programme d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00bb en vue de r\u00e9pondre au probl\u00e8me de la \u00ab discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00bb dans le cadre de l\u2019embauche et de la promotion d\u2019un groupe d\u00e9savantag\u00e9, les femmes en l\u2019occurrence. Pour rendre cette d\u00e9cision, la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tait tenue d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet de \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019attitude \u00e0 adopter quand il s\u2019agit d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter des lois et des codes sur les droits de la personne \u00bb (Action Travail des Femmes, \u00e0 la page 1133) :\nLa l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l\u2019essor des droits individuels d\u2019importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu\u2019en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu\u2019elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu\u2019offre la Loi d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets. [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\nLes objets de la Loi sembleraient tout \u00e0 fait \u00e9vidents, compte tenu des termes puissants de l\u2019art. 2. Pour que tous puissent avoir des chances \u00e9gales d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9panouissement \u00bb, la Loi cherche \u00e0 interdire \u00ab les consid\u00e9rations \u00bb fond\u00e9es notamment sur le sexe. C\u2019est l\u2019acte discriminatoire lui-m\u00eame que l\u2019on veut pr\u00e9venir. La Loi n\u2019a pas pour objet de punir la faute, mais bien de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination.\n[\u2026]\nLe premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 judiciaire complet de l\u2019attitude \u00e0 adopter au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne se retrouve dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145, \u00e0 la p. 158, o\u00f9 le juge Lamer souligne qu\u2019un code des droits de la personne ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab comme n\u2019importe quelle autre loi d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut le reconna\u00eetre pour ce qu\u2019il est, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une loi fondamentale. \u00bb Ce principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 davantage par le juge McIntyre, au nom d\u2019une Cour unanime, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Winnipeg School Division No. 1 c. Craton [\u2026].\n[\u2026]\nL\u2019accent mis sur la \u00ab nature sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb des textes l\u00e9gislatifs portant sur les droits de la personne constituait une forte indication de l\u2019attitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que prendrait la Cour au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de tels textes.\n(Action Travail des Femmes, aux pages 1134, 1135 et 1136.)\n[74] S\u2019appuyant sur cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que l\u2019ordonnance que le Tribunal avait rendue relevait de la comp\u00e9tence que lui conf\u00e9rait l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) de l\u2019ancienne Loi.\n[75] Les commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes ont trait \u00e0 la bonne mani\u00e8re d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter les dispositions l\u00e9gales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Cet arr\u00eat ne porte pas sur la question de la primaut\u00e9, ni sur celle de savoir si une plainte contestant un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, tombe \u00e0 juste titre sous le coup de la Loi. Les principes d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes, m\u00eame s\u2019ils sont instructifs, ne semblent \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que dans la mesure o\u00f9 il faudrait en tenir compte dans le cadre de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du terme \u00ab services \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi (par exemple, voir Watkin, aux paragraphes 33 et 34).\nAndrews [76] M. Andrews, un sujet britannique qui \u00e9tait r\u00e9sident permanent du Canada, remplissait toutes les conditions d\u2019admission au Barreau de la Colombie-Britannique, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de celle relative \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne. Son action visant \u00e0 obtenir un jugement d\u00e9claratoire portant que cette condition violait le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en premi\u00e8re instance, mais accueillie en appel. Les questions soumises \u00e0 la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9taient les suivantes : 1) si l\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00eatre citoyen canadien pour \u00eatre admis au Barreau de la Colombie-Britannique portait atteinte aux droits \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte, et 2) dans l\u2019affirmative, si cette atteinte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e par l\u2019article premier. Une majorit\u00e9 des juges de la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que la condition de la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne violait le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte et ne pouvait se justifier au regard de l\u2019article premier.\n[77] Les plaignants se fondent sur l\u2019extrait suivant des motifs des juges McIntyre et Lamer (tel \u00e9tait alors leur titre) :\nLa discrimination est inacceptable dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique parce qu\u2019elle incarne les pires effets de la d\u00e9n\u00e9gation de l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 et la discrimination consacr\u00e9e par la loi est particuli\u00e8rement r\u00e9pugnante. La pire forme d\u2019oppression r\u00e9sulte de mesures discriminatoires ayant force de loi.\n(Andrews, \u00e0 la page 172.)\n[78] La phrase qui suit cet extrait est la suivante :\nC\u2019est une garantie contre ce mal que fournit l\u2019art. 15.\n(Andrews, \u00e0 la page 172.)\n[79] Le juge McIntyre ajoute ensuite dans ses motifs :\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour doit aborder la question de la discrimination au sens o\u00f9 ce terme est utilis\u00e9 au par. 15(1) de la Charte. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on peut affirmer que les principes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s en vertu des lois sur les droits de la personne s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019examen des questions de discrimination au sens du par. 15(1). Il faut cependant tenir compte de certaines distinctions qui d\u00e9coulent de la diff\u00e9rence entre la Charte et les lois sur les droits de la personne. D\u2019abord, la discrimination dont il est question au par. 15(1) est restreinte \u00e0 celle qui d\u00e9coule de l\u2019application de la loi alors que les lois sur les droits de la personne s\u2019appliquent aussi aux activit\u00e9s de nature priv\u00e9e. [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\nLorsque les lois sur les droits de la personne interdisent la discrimination, elles le font de mani\u00e8re absolue et lorsqu\u2019elles pr\u00e9voient un moyen de d\u00e9fense ou une exception, c\u2019est \u00e9galement en termes absolus et la discrimination est alors permise. Il n\u2019y a pas de moyen terme \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans la Charte toutefois, bien que le par. 15(1), sous r\u00e9serve du par. (2), interdise la discrimination de mani\u00e8re absolue, l\u2019article premier permet que des limites raisonnables soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019application du par. 15(1). Le paragraphe 15(1) exige donc une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente. Bien que la discrimination au sens du par. 15(1) soit de m\u00eame nature et corresponde sur le plan de sa description au concept de discrimination \u00e9labor\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des lois sur les droits de la personne, une autre \u00e9tape devra \u00eatre franchie pour d\u00e9cider si des lois discriminatoires peuvent \u00eatre justifi\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019article premier. Il appartiendra \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019\u00e9tablir cela. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une \u00e9tape distincte n\u00e9cessaire en vertu de la Charte et que l\u2019on ne trouve pas dans la plupart des lois sur les droits de la personne parce que dans ces lois la justification de la discrimination r\u00e9side g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans des exceptions aux droits fondamentaux.\n(Andrews, aux pages 175 et 176.)\n[80] Vu la distinction qui est cr\u00e9\u00e9e entre les lois sur les droits de la personne et la Charte dans le raisonnement du juge McIntyre, y compris le commentaire selon lequel c\u2019est l\u2019article 15 de la Charte qui offre une garantie contre les mesures discriminatoires ayant force de loi, l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews ne semble pas \u00e9tayer l\u2019argument selon lequel un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi. Cet arr\u00eat semble plut\u00f4t sous-entendre que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la loi sur les droits de la personne applicable, c\u2019est la Charte qui traite de la discrimination caus\u00e9e par l\u2019application ou la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une loi, ainsi qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy.\nLarocque [81] M. Larocque, candidat \u00e0 un poste de policier municipal, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu du processus d\u2019embauche parce qu\u2019il ne satisfaisait pas \u00e0 la norme minimale d\u2019acuit\u00e9 auditive adopt\u00e9e par la Ville de Montr\u00e9al en vertu des pouvoirs r\u00e9glementaires que lui conf\u00e9rait sa loi constitutive. Il avait port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse, all\u00e9guant que le refus de l\u2019embaucher \u00e9tait un acte discriminatoire contraire aux articles 10 et 16 de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec. L\u2019affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise au Tribunal des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, qui avait conclu qu\u2019il ne pouvait condamner la Ville \u00e0 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour un acte r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019application de ses pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs et r\u00e9glementaires. Il a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la norme r\u00e9glementaire inopposable au plaignant et ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Ville de reconsid\u00e9rer la demande du plaignant en fonction du processus d\u2019embauche, tel qu\u2019il existait lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa candidature, en lui accordant tous les avantages qu\u2019il aurait eus s\u2019il n\u2019en avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vinc\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel du Qu\u00e9bec a restreint la r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la seule d\u00e9claration d\u2019inopposabilit\u00e9 de la norme au plaignant.\n[82] Le texte des articles 10 et 16 de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec, L.R.Q. ch. C\u201112, est le suivant :\n10. Toute personne a droit \u00e0 la reconnaissance et \u00e0 l\u2019exercice, en pleine \u00e9galit\u00e9, des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne, sans distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence fond\u00e9e sur la race, la couleur, le sexe, la grossesse, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat civil, l\u2019\u00e2ge sauf dans la mesure pr\u00e9vue par la loi, la religion, les convictions politiques, la langue, l\u2019origine ethnique ou nationale, la condition sociale, le handicap ou l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un moyen pour pallier ce handicap.\nIl y a discrimination lorsqu\u2019une telle distinction, exclusion ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence a pour effet de d\u00e9truire ou de compromettre ce droit.\n16. Nul ne peut exercer de discrimination dans l\u2019embauche, l\u2019apprentissage, la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode de probation, la formation professionnelle, la promotion, la mutation, le d\u00e9placement, la mise \u00e0 pied, la suspension, le renvoi ou les conditions de travail d\u2019une personne ainsi que dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de cat\u00e9gories ou de classifications d\u2019emploi.\n[83] L\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour supr\u00eame avait trait \u00e0 la port\u00e9e des pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration que le Tribunal des droits de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec pouvait exercer en vertu de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne de cette province. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour :\nLa nature du r\u00e9gime constitutionnel canadien doit \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9tablir la hi\u00e9rarchie des normes gouvernant l\u2019action des l\u00e9gislatures et celle des corps publics, comme les municipalit\u00e9s, auxquels sont validement d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s des pouvoirs l\u00e9gislatifs. La pr\u00e9sence des immunit\u00e9s traditionnelles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des cons\u00e9quences de la nullit\u00e9 d\u2019actes de nature l\u00e9gislative trouve sans doute son fondement ultime dans l\u2019existence d\u2019un tel r\u00e9gime constitutionnel, o\u00f9 le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif doit s\u2019exercer dans le cadre de la loi, mais ind\u00e9pendamment, sans interf\u00e9rence des r\u00e8gles de responsabilit\u00e9 civile de droit commun. L\u2019application de la Charte qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise, instrument de nature quasi constitutionnelle dans les mati\u00e8res relevant de la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gislative du Qu\u00e9bec, se situe dans ce cadre juridique et repose toujours sur les principes fondamentaux d\u2019organisation des pouvoirs publics qui s\u2019en inspirent.\n(Larocque, au paragraphe 17.)\n[84] \u00c0 ce sujet, la Cour a conclu que \u00ab des principes bien \u00e9tablis de droit public excluent la possibilit\u00e9 de recours en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats lorsque des lois sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es constitutionnellement invalides [\u2026] \u00bb (Larocque, au paragraphe 19). On ne pouvait donc pas adjuger des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Ville \u00e0 cause des effets discriminatoires qu\u2019avait son r\u00e8glement sur M. Larocque. Elle a toutefois conclu qu\u2019une d\u00e9claration d\u2019inopposabilit\u00e9 au r\u00e8glement de la Ville, ainsi qu\u2019une ordonnance obligeant la Ville \u00e0 reconsid\u00e9rer la demande de M. Larocque en fonction des r\u00e8gles r\u00e9gissant l\u2019embauche d\u2019agents de police qui \u00e9taient en vigueur lors de la pr\u00e9sentation de sa candidature, mais sans tenir compte de sa perte de capacit\u00e9 auditive, constitueraient une r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e selon la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[85] Comme dans la situation dont il \u00e9tait question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Craton, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu qu\u2019il y avait un conflit entre une loi sur les droits de la personne et un r\u00e8glement municipal adopt\u00e9 en vertu d\u2019une loi. Le r\u00e9sultat de cette situation, dans la mesure de l\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9, \u00e9tait que cela rendait inop\u00e9rant le r\u00e8glement municipal. Cependant, l\u00e0 encore, tout comme dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Craton, la plainte de M. Larocque \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en des termes de \u00ab discrimination \u00bb conform\u00e9ment aux articles 10 et 16 de la Charte des droits et libert\u00e9s de la personne du Qu\u00e9bec. Selon sa plainte, il \u00e9tait victime de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche. La Ville justifiait la mesure prise en se fondant sur les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e9rait le r\u00e8glement. Le conflit avec la loi sur les droits de la personne n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la plainte elle-m\u00eame, mais une partie de l\u2019analyse de la plainte. En analysant les pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration du Tribunal du Qu\u00e9bec, la Cour supr\u00eame, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Larocque, n\u2019indique pas qu\u2019il est possible, en vertu d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne, de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre. La \u00ab discrimination \u00bb, au sens de la loi applicable, \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00e9sente.\nTranchemontagne [86] M. Tranchemontagne et M. Werbeski avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 chacun une demande de soutien en vertu de la Loi de 1997 sur le Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es (LPOSPH), et le directeur du programme avait rejet\u00e9 leurs demandes. Le Tribunal de l\u2019aide sociale (TAS) avait rejet\u00e9 leur appel en application du paragraphe 5(2) de la LPOSPH, en se fondant sur sa conclusion que tous deux souffraient d\u2019alcoolisme. En rendant sa conclusion, le TAS a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la question de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 du paragraphe 5(2) selon le Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario.\n[87] La question que soulevait l\u2019appel interjet\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Cour supr\u00eame consistait \u00e0 savoir si le TAS \u00e9tait tenu de suivre la loi provinciale sur les droits de la personne lorsqu\u2019il rendait ses d\u00e9cisions (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Tranchemontagne, au paragraphe 1). La majorit\u00e9 a conclu que le TAS avait comp\u00e9tence pour prendre en consid\u00e9ration le Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario. Comme le TAS pouvait trancher des questions de droit, il s\u2019ensuivait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 avoir comp\u00e9tence pour examiner l\u2019ensemble des r\u00e8gles de droit quand il avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider si un demandeur \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 une mesure de soutien du revenu. Il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que le TAS \u00e9tait en mesure d\u2019examiner toute source juridique susceptible d\u2019influer sur sa d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, y compris le Code des droits de la personne (voir Tranchemontagne, au paragraphe 40). Le TAS ne pouvait donc pas refuser d\u2019examiner une question relative aux droits de la personne, et l\u2019affaire lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour qu\u2019il se prononce sur la question de l\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 du paragraphe 5(2) de la LPOSPH (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Tranchemontagne, aux paragraphes 52 et 53).\n[88] Pour arriver \u00e0 leur conclusion, les juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame ont indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario :\nLa caract\u00e9ristique la plus importante du Code pour les besoins du pr\u00e9sent pourvoi est qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une loi fondamentale, quasi constitutionnelle [\u2026]. Il faut donc lui donner une interpr\u00e9tation lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, dans le but de prot\u00e9ger largement les droits des personnes vis\u00e9es [\u2026]. Et non seulement le Code doit s\u2019entendre dans le contexte de son objet, mais il doit aussi, comme la Charte, \u00eatre reconnu comme une loi pour le peuple [\u2026]. Par cons\u00e9quent, il faut non seulement lui attribuer un sens \u00e9tendu, mais aussi lui assurer une application accessible.\n(Tranchemontagne, au paragraphe 33.)\n[89] Les juges majoritaires ont \u00e9galement fait remarquer que le l\u00e9gislateur ontarien a jug\u00e9 bon de pr\u00e9voir que ses mandataires et lui \u00e9taient li\u00e9s par le Code des droits de la personne, au paragraphe 47(1), et il a par ailleurs accord\u00e9 \u00e0 ce Code la primaut\u00e9 sur tous les autres textes l\u00e9gislatifs, au paragraphe 47(2). Par suite de la clause de primaut\u00e9, \u00ab les dispositions du Code l\u2019emportent sur les dispositions incompatibles d\u2019une autre loi provinciale \u00bb (arr\u00eat Tranchemontagne, au paragraphe 34). Pour ce qui \u00e9tait de la clause de primaut\u00e9, les juges majoritaires ont indiqu\u00e9 :\nCette clause de primaut\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente des ressemblances et des diff\u00e9rences avec l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, qui proclame la supr\u00e9matie de la Constitution. Au chapitre des ressemblances, les deux dispositions visent \u00e0 rendre inop\u00e9rantes les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives incompatibles. Au bout du compte, s\u2019il y a conflit avec le Code ou la Constitution, l\u2019autre disposition n\u2019est pas appliqu\u00e9e et, dans ce cas en particulier, c\u2019est comme si la loi n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e. Mais \u00e0 mon avis, les diff\u00e9rences entre les deux dispositions sont beaucoup plus importantes. Tout d\u2019abord, une disposition d\u00e9clar\u00e9e invalide sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 validement adopt\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019a jamais exist\u00e9 en tant que disposition valide parce que le l\u00e9gislateur qui l\u2019a adopt\u00e9e n\u2019a jamais eu le pouvoir de le faire. Mais lorsqu\u2019une disposition est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inapplicable en vertu du par. 47 du Code, il n\u2019est pas question de sa validit\u00e9. Le l\u00e9gislateur avait le pouvoir d\u2019adopter la disposition incompatible; il se trouve seulement qu\u2019il a \u00e9galement \u00e9dict\u00e9 une autre r\u00e8gle de droit qui pr\u00e9vaut.\nAinsi, la question de savoir si une disposition est constitutionnelle et celle de savoir si elle est compatible avec le Code sont deux choses diff\u00e9rentes mettant en jeu deux sortes d\u2019analyse. Lorsqu\u2019un tribunal administratif ou judiciaire se fonde sur l\u2019art. 47 du Code pour d\u00e9clarer une autre r\u00e8gle de droit inapplicable, il ne d\u00e9borde pas le cadre de cette loi pour en examiner la validit\u00e9, comme ce serait le cas s\u2019il accomplissait les deux activit\u00e9s auxquelles le TAS ne peut se livrer selon le par. 67(2) de la LPOT. Il ne d\u00e9clare pas que de toute fa\u00e7on le l\u00e9gislateur a eu tort de l\u2019\u00e9dicter. Au contraire, il applique tout simplement la clause de primaut\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur lui-m\u00eame et modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 son gr\u00e9. La diff\u00e9rence entre l\u2019art. 47 du Code et l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 est donc la diff\u00e9rence entre le fait de respecter l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur et celui d\u2019y passer outre.\n(Tranchemontagne, aux paragraphes 35 et 36.)\n[90] L\u2019arr\u00eat Tranchemontagne est instructif pour ce qui est de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne, mais les commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame ne d\u00e9notent pas qu\u2019une plainte contestant un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne. La Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas admis implicitement non plus que le versement de prestations de soutien \u00e0 des personnes handicap\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019un programme \u00e9tabli par voie l\u00e9gislative pouvait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario, ainsi que l\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 la Commission (Melody Katrina Schneider, Jeremy Eugene Matson et Mardy Eugene Matson c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (T1444\/7009), Observations \u00e9crites de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vue du premier volet de l\u2019audience du Tribunal (qui sera tenue du 30 janvier au 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013), document dat\u00e9 du 11 janvier 2013, au paragraphe 56).\n[91] La Cour supr\u00eame indique plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il se peut qu\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne rende des lois inapplicables et que le TAS est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, des arguments li\u00e9s aux droits de la personne. Cependant, elle a laiss\u00e9 au TAS le soin de trancher le bien-fond\u00e9 de ces arguments. Comme l\u2019ont sp\u00e9cifi\u00e9 les juges LeBel, Deschamps et Abella dans leurs motifs dissidents : \u00ab [l]a question n\u2019est pas de savoir si une partie peut contester une disposition de la LPOSPH au motif qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas compatible avec le Code, mais bien de savoir o\u00f9 la contestation peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, si elle peut l\u2019\u00eatre devant le directeur ou le TAS. \u00bb (Tranchemontagne, au paragraphe 69).\nLa conclusion sur la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada [92] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne \u00e9tayent, selon moi, la pr\u00e9tention des plaignants et de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne peut rendre inop\u00e9rante une loi qui est en conflit avec elle. Mais cela ne veut pas dire que la Loi autorise les plaignants \u00e0 contester le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, sauf s\u2019il existe un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\n[93] Il n\u2019y a, dans ces arr\u00eats, aucun commentaire de la Cour supr\u00eame qui indique que la primaut\u00e9 d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de contester un texte de loi en vertu d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne. Le fondement du conflit entre deux lois dans les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 sous la forme d\u2019une plainte de \u00ab discrimination \u00bb, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la loi sur les droits de la personne applicable dans ces arr\u00eats. Les plaintes elles-m\u00eames n\u2019\u00e9taient pas une contestation du libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois.\n[94] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne sont en fait compatibles avec la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a rendue la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Murphy, en ce sens que cette derni\u00e8re a exig\u00e9 qu\u2019il y ait fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, pour que, dans cette affaire, il existe une plainte valide.\n(ii) Autres arr\u00eats jurisprudentiels f\u00e9d\u00e9raux reconnaissant la primaut\u00e9 d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne [95] La Commission soutient que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, une longue s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles rendues au sein du r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de protection des droits de la personne reconnaissait que la Loi avait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur d\u2019autres lois incompatibles, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans des arr\u00eats tels que Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne. La Commission se fonde sur les arr\u00eats f\u00e9d\u00e9raux suivants : Druken (CAF); Gonzalez; McAllister\u2011Windsor; Uzoaba, sur les motifs dissidents du juge en chef Dickson et du juge Lamer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bhinder, ainsi que sur les motifs dissidents des juges McLachlin et L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper.\nDruken (CAF) [96] Druken (CAF) \u00e9tait le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal : Druken c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration), 1987 CanLII 99 (TCDP) [Druken (TCDP)]. Les plaignantes avaient port\u00e9 plainte en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, all\u00e9guant que la mise en cause avait commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et la situation de famille dans le cadre de la fourniture de services. Elles s\u2019\u00e9taient vu refuser des prestations d\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage en application des alin\u00e9as 3(2)c) et 4(3)d) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage ainsi que de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14a) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage parce qu\u2019elles travaillaient pour leurs \u00e9poux, ou pour des entreprises dont ces derniers contr\u00f4laient plus de 40 % des actions avec droit de vote. Le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage \u00e9tait un service :\nJe me guide sur l\u2019affaire Christine Morrell c. la Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration du Canada (1985) C.C.H.R. 3021, o\u00f9 le tribunal a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu discrimination contre Christine Morrell lorsqu\u2019on avait refus\u00e9 de poursuivre ses prestations normales d\u2019assurance- ch\u00f4mage, parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait enceinte. Je souscris \u00e0 la conclusion du tribunal dans cette affaire, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage n\u2019est pas seulement un service fourni par la mise en cause et mis \u00e0 la disposition du public en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais qu\u2019elle constitue en plus un service auquel la plupart des membres du public qui travaillent doivent participer en vertu de la loi. C\u2019est pourquoi, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je conclus aussi que les plaignantes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9es d\u2019un service g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement assur\u00e9 au public, pour un motif illicite de discrimination.\n(Druken (TCDP).)\n[97] Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage \u00e9tait selon lui un service, le Tribunal a ensuite eu \u00e0 examiner une pratique qui \u00e9tait discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue mais qui \u00e9tait prescrite par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage et le R\u00e8glement. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLe pr\u00e9sent tribunal ne con\u00e7oit pas comment le gouvernement n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9vu un \u00e9ventuel conflit entre la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et les autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Le fait que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne fasse allusion \u00e0 plusieurs exceptions dans son application laisse entendre le contraire. Le pr\u00e9sent tribunal souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019opinion exprim\u00e9e par les juges Ritchie et Lamer, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019en l\u2019absence, dans la Loi elle-m\u00eame, de passages qui en limiteraient express\u00e9ment l\u2019application, un texte de droit aussi public et fondamental doit avoir pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur les autres lois.\nN\u00e9anmoins, le pr\u00e9sent tribunal estime que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne contient effectivement des dispositions con\u00e7ues en pr\u00e9vision de conflits \u00e9ventuels entre cette loi elle- m\u00eame et la Loi sur l\u2019assurance- ch\u00f4mage ou d\u2019autres textes f\u00e9d\u00e9raux.\n[\u2026]\n[\u2026] En d\u2019autres termes, la mise en cause ne perp\u00e8tre pas un acte discriminatoire en refusant les prestations d\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage aux plaignantes, s\u2019il existe un motif justifiable de le faire.\nLe pr\u00e9sent tribunal estime donc que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage peuvent \u00eatre valides en m\u00eame temps.\n(Druken (TCDP).)\n[98] Le Tribunal a conclu que la mise en cause n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif justifiable de refuser de verser des prestations aux plaignantes, et il a ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle mette fin \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire consistant \u00e0 appliquer les dispositions contest\u00e9es de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage et du R\u00e8glement.\n[99] Au stade du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 comme suit les questions en litige :\nBien qu'ils fussent soulev\u00e9s dans le m\u00e9moire du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repris l'argument voulant que la fourniture de prestations d'assurance-ch\u00f4mage ne soit pas un service destin\u00e9 au public et l'argument que sa privation en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 3(2)c) de la Loi sur l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage et de l'alin\u00e9a 14a) [mod. par DORS\/78-710, art. 1] du R\u00e8glement sur l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage est fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial et\/ou la situation de famille de la personne concern\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re assertion semble si \u00e9vidente en soi qu'elle n'a pas besoin d'\u00eatre comment\u00e9e. En ce qui concerne la proposition pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le requ\u00e9rant semble avoir trouv\u00e9 convaincante l'opinion incidente exprim\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Singh (Re), [1989] 1 C.F. 430 (C.A.) dans laquelle le juge Hugessen, pronon\u00e7ant les motifs de cette Cour, a dit \u00e0 la page 440:\nOn peut \u00e0 vrai dire soutenir que les termes qualificatifs de l'article 5\n5. ... le fournisseur de ... services ... destin\u00e9s au public ...\nne peuvent jouer qu'un r\u00f4le limitatif dans le contexte des services qui sont rendus par des personnes physiques ou par des personnes morales et que, par d\u00e9finition, les services que rendent les fonctionnaires publics aux frais de l'\u00c9tat sont des services destin\u00e9s au public et qu'ils tombent donc sous le coup de l'article 5. Il n'est cependant pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher cette question de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci et il suffit de dire qu'il est loin d'\u00eatre clair pour moi que les services rendus, tant au Canada qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger, par les fonctionnaires charg\u00e9s de l'application de la Loi sur l'immigration de 1976 ne sont pas des services destin\u00e9s au public.\nQuoi qu'il en soit, la conclusion de fait fondamentale du tribunal que les intim\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d'un acte discriminatoire illicite n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Les principaux arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s concernaient la question de savoir si le tribunal avait commis une erreur en ordonnant \u00e0 la Commission de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration du Canada, la \u00ab CEIC \u00bb, d'\u00ab interrompre la pratique ... qui consiste \u00e0 appliquer les alin\u00e9as 3(2)c) et 4(3)d) de la Loi sur l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage, ainsi que l'article 14A du R\u00e8glement \u00bb, ce qui revenait effectivement \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer ces dispositions inop\u00e9rantes, et s'il s'\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9 en concluant que cette privation des prestations ne s'appuyait sur aucun motif justifiable faisant relever l'acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 de l'exception pr\u00e9vue par l'alin\u00e9a 14g). Le premier des points qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent se fondait sur deux moyens: (1) la Loi sur les droits de la personne n'a point pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance sur les autres lois du Parlement et (2) un tribunal ad hoc n'est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives inop\u00e9rantes ou \u00e0 rendre une ordonnance ayant un tel effet.\n(Druken (CAF), aux p. 28 et 29.)\n[100] Pour ce qui est de la premi\u00e8re question, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu :\nLa r\u00e8gle applicable \u00e0 l'incompatibilit\u00e9 d'une loi sur les droits de la personne avec une autre loi semble \u00eatre qu'une mesure l\u00e9gislative post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 une loi sur les droits de la personne et incompatible avec quelque disposition de cette derni\u00e8re ne doit s'interpr\u00e9ter comme abrogeant cette disposition que si elle d\u00e9clare clairement y apporter une exception; par contre, la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 une autre mesure l\u00e9gislative avec laquelle elle est incompatible abroge de fa\u00e7on implicite cette derni\u00e8re.\nLes circonstances de l'esp\u00e8ce semblent pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00eatre de celles qui, a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 dit, auraient amen\u00e9 l'affaire Winnipeg School \u00e0 \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e sur le fondement de l'abrogation implicite. L'alin\u00e9a 3(2)c) de la Loi sur l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage, une disposition figurant dans la l\u00e9gislation canadienne sur l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage depuis 1941, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 le plus r\u00e9cemment en 1971 (S.C. 1970-71-72, chap. 48, art. 3(2)c)). L'alin\u00e9a 4(3)d), qui maintient une exception adopt\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 1955, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 dans sa forme actuelle en 1975 (S.C. 1974-75-76, chap. 80, art. 2). Ni l'un ni l'autre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9\u00e9dict\u00e9 ult\u00e9rieurement. Tous deux faisaient partie de \u00ab la l\u00e9gislation canadienne actuelle \u00bb lorsque la Loi sur les droits de la personne, dont l'objet est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2 cit\u00e9 plus haut, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e en 1977 (S.C. 1976-77, chap. 33).\nA mon avis, la pr\u00e9sente demande doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e en tenant pour acquis qu'en 1977, les alin\u00e9as 3(2)c) et 4(3)d) de la Loi sur l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9s implicitement par l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi sur les droits de la personne. Je crois que cette Cour agirait de fa\u00e7on assez irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re si elle tranchait la pr\u00e9sente affaire en partant de l'hypoth\u00e8se que les dispositions relatives \u00e0 l'assurance-ch\u00f4mage sont celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9es subs\u00e9quemment. Cette Cour \u00e9noncerait ainsi des avis consultatifs sur la question de savoir si, r\u00e9dig\u00e9s comme ils le sont, ces alin\u00e9as constituaient des d\u00e9clarations l\u00e9gislatives suffisamment claires pour cr\u00e9er des exceptions \u00e0 la Loi sur les droits de la personne et dans la n\u00e9gative, comme dans le cas de l'article 50 de la Public Schools Act, sur la question de savoir si les actes discriminatoires dont elles ordonnent l'accomplissement dans ces alin\u00e9as s'appuient sur des motifs justifiables. Il reste \u00e0 statuer sur les objections pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'encontre des mesures correctrices.\n(Druken (CAF), aux p. 31 et 32.)\n[101] Quant \u00e0 la question des r\u00e9parations, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal avait le pouvoir de d\u00e9clarer qu\u2019un texte de loi \u00e9tait inop\u00e9rant, ou de rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 cet effet, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) de la Loi (aujourd\u2019hui, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)).\n[102] En conformit\u00e9 avec les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque, les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans Druken ont rendu inop\u00e9rants des textes de loi qui \u00e9taient en conflit avec la Loi. Cependant, toujours en conformit\u00e9 avec les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque, ainsi qu\u2019avec la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, le fondement du conflit de lois dans Druken a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 sous la forme d\u2019une plainte d\u2019\u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb en vertu de la Loi, dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage, comme cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu par le Tribunal et, au stade du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, non contest\u00e9. L\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy met en doute la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage est un service, mais les d\u00e9cisions Druken concordent avec le raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat, en ce sens qu\u2019il existait un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, au sens de la Loi, qui faisait en sorte que le Tribunal \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent en la mati\u00e8re.\nGonzalez [103] L\u2019affaire Gonzalez \u00e9tait un renvoi \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, par le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, pour le compte de la Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration, au sujet de la question suivante :\nLe paragraphe 11(7) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage, L.R.C. (1985) ch. U\u20111, est-il contraire \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985) ch. H\u20116, en ce qu\u2019il constituerait un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille en mati\u00e8re de fourniture de services?\n(Gonzalez, au paragraphe 12.)\n[104] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9but\u00e9 son analyse en formulant la r\u00e9serve suivante :\nJe d\u00e9bute mon analyse en pr\u00e9cisant que le l\u00e9gislateur est constamment appel\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des choix et que la simple existence d\u2019une distinction n\u2019\u00e9quivaut pas \u00e0 discrimination. Ce n\u2019est que dans la mesure o\u00f9 une distinction est illicite au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP qu\u2019elle est susceptible de donner lieu \u00e0 un traitement discriminatoire.\n(Gonzalez, au paragraphe 30.)\n[105] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a fait valoir que le refus de payer des prestations d\u00e9coulait de l\u2019application de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage et que le d\u00e9ni all\u00e9gu\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas imputable aux actions de la Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration en tant que fournisseur de services au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. \u00c0 ce sujet, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que \u00ab cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0, a bon droit, \u00e9t\u00e9 conc\u00e9d\u00e9e par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans l\u2019affaire Druken \u00bb (Gonzalez, au paragraphe 36). Et, d\u2019ajouter la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\nMalgr\u00e9 le fait que le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n\u2019ait pas fait de concession \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent renvoi, il me semble \u00e9vident que le syst\u00e8me d\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage est un service offert au public et on a port\u00e9 \u00e0 mon attention aucune raison qui me permettrait d\u2019exclure ce service de la port\u00e9 de l\u2019article 5 au motif qu\u2019il est offert par l\u2019\u00c9tat.\n(Gonzalez, au paragraphe 37.)\n[106] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ensuite conclu que le paragraphe 11(7) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage \u00e9tait discriminatoire et que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral ne pouvait pas motiver de mani\u00e8re justifiable la discrimination. La d\u00e9claration de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle le paragraphe 11(7) \u00e9tait discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an afin de permettre au l\u00e9gislateur de rem\u00e9dier au traitement discriminatoire. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 que si le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019agissait pas dans le d\u00e9lai imparti, la Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration devait cesser d\u2019appliquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11(7)a) et le tribunal saisi de la plainte de Mme Gonzalez devait la trancher en tenant pour acquis que la disposition en question \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 la Loi.\n[107] Comme cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas dans les d\u00e9cisions Druken ainsi que dans les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque, le fondement du conflit de lois a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 sous la forme d\u2019une plainte d\u2019\u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens de la Loi, dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage. L\u00e0 encore, m\u00eame si l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy met en doute la conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage est un service, la d\u00e9cision Gonzalez concorde avec le raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat, en ce sens qu\u2019il existait un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, au sens de la Loi, qui faisait en sorte que le Tribunal \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent en la mati\u00e8re.\nMcAllister-Windsor [108] La Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage limitait \u00e0 trente le nombre de semaines pendant lesquelles un prestataire peut recevoir des prestations de maternit\u00e9, de maladie ou parentales. Dans le cas de Mme McAllister-Windsor, \u00e0 cause de la combinaison de sa grossesse et de sa d\u00e9ficience, celle-ci avait perdu son droit \u00e0 des prestations parentales. Elle all\u00e9guait que le plafond fix\u00e9 avait sur elle un effet discriminatoire dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un service destin\u00e9 au public, du fait de son sexe et de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[109] Pour d\u00e9terminer si la plainte \u00e9tablissait l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nPersonne ne conteste que la fourniture par DRHC de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi est un service \u00ab destin\u00e9 au public \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n(McAllister-Windsor, au paragraphe 30.)\n[110] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa th\u00e8se selon laquelle il \u00e9tait incontest\u00e9 que la fourniture de prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi constituait un \u00ab service \u00bb, le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Gonzalez (voir McAllister-Windsor, au paragraphe 30).\n[111] Le Tribunal a conclu que, m\u00eame si le paragraphe 11(5) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage \u00e9tait, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, une r\u00e8gle neutre, il avait non seulement un effet disproportionn\u00e9 mais aussi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable uniquement sur les femmes enceintes qui, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de Mme McAllister-Windsor, avaient demand\u00e9 des prestations de maladie (voir McAllister-Windsor, au paragraphe 52). De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 - Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada - n\u2019avait pas fait la preuve qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas composer avec les personnes pr\u00e9sentant les caract\u00e9ristiques de la plaignante sans subir une contrainte excessive (voir McAllister-Windsor, au paragraphe 71). Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de cesser d\u2019appliquer les dispositions du paragraphe 11(5) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage, mais a suspendu l\u2019application de l\u2019ordonnance pendant une p\u00e9riode de 12 mois afin de permettre au l\u00e9gislateur de rem\u00e9dier au probl\u00e8me. Il a aussi accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale et des int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[112] Comme dans le cas des d\u00e9cisions Druken et Gonzalez, ainsi que des arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque, le fondement du conflit de lois dans l\u2019affaire McAllister-Windsor a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 sous la forme d\u2019un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb en vertu de la Loi dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, soit l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage. L\u00e0 encore, m\u00eame si l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy met en doute la conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage est un service, l\u2019affaire McAllister\u2011Windsor concorde avec le raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat, en ce sens que l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, au sens de la Loi, faisait en sorte que le Tribunal \u00e9tait comp\u00e9tent en la mati\u00e8re.\nUzoaba [113] Dans la d\u00e9cision Uzoaba, une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale avait \u00e0 d\u00e9cider, notamment, si le Tribunal avait commis une erreur en ordonnant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le plaignant \u00e0 un niveau situ\u00e9 \u00e0 deux \u00e9chelons de plus que celui qu\u2019il occupait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019on avait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 ses droits. L\u2019avocat du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral faisait valoir que la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique \u00e9tablissait un r\u00e9gime de promotions accord\u00e9es au m\u00e9rite et que le Tribunal ne pouvait y passer outre. En rejetant cet argument, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLe droit est clair et l\u2019avocat du procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral reconna\u00eet qu\u2019en cas de conflit direct, la Loi s\u2019appliquera. Il soutient toutefois qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un conflit direct en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je ne vois pas comment cet argument peut \u00eatre utile \u00e0 l\u2019avocat. En fait, l\u2019avocat de M. Uzoaba pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun conflit r\u00e9el entre la Loi et la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique. Il affirme que les dispositions de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique relatives \u00e0 la promotion suivant le principe du m\u00e9rite s\u2019appliquent dans l\u2019administration quotidienne et normale de la fonction publique et que la Loi n\u2019est pas cens\u00e9e supplanter la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. D\u2019un point de vue pratique, je suis d\u2019accord avec cet argument.\nCependant, m\u00eame si le pouvoir d\u2019un tribunal des droits de la personne d\u2019ordonner qu\u2019une promotion soit accord\u00e9e \u00e0 un fonctionnaire entre en conflit avec la Loi sur l\u2019emploi et la fonction publique, je suis convaincu que les dispositions de la Loi doivent avoir pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance.\nDans l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114 (l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes), le juge en chef Dickson dit aux pages 1135 et 1136 :\nLe premier \u00e9nonc\u00e9 judiciaire complet de l\u2019attitude \u00e0 adopter au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne se retrouve dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145, \u00e0 la p. 158, o\u00f9 le juge Lamer souligne qu\u2019un code des droits de la personne ne doit pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00ab comme n\u2019importe quelle autre loi d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, il faut le reconna\u00eetre pour ce qu\u2019il est, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une loi fondamentale. \u00bb Ce principe d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 davantage par le juge McIntyre, au nom d\u2019une Cour unanime, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Winnipeg School Division No. 1 c. Craton, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 150, \u00e0 la p. 156 :\nUne loi sur les droits de la personne est de nature sp\u00e9ciale et \u00e9nonce une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale applicable \u00e0 des questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Elle n\u2019est pas de nature constitutionnelle, en ce sens qu\u2019elle ne peut pas \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e, r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ou abrog\u00e9e par la l\u00e9gislature. Elle est cependant d\u2019une nature telle que seule une d\u00e9claration l\u00e9gislative claire peut permettre de la modifier, de la r\u00e9viser ou de l\u2019abroger, ou encore de cr\u00e9er des exceptions \u00e0 ses dispositions.\nL\u2019accent mis sur la \u00ab nature sp\u00e9ciale \u00bb des textes l\u00e9gislatifs portant sur les droits de la personne constituait une forte indication de l\u2019attitude g\u00e9n\u00e9rale que prendrait la Cour au sujet de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de tels textes.\nJe pense que le principe de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance doit s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour permettre \u00e0 un tribunal des droits de la personne d\u2019ordonner l\u2019octroi d\u2019une promotion qui, selon lui, a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e pour des motifs discriminatoires, en violation de la Loi. En d\u2019autres termes, la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission de la fonction publique et la proc\u00e9dure qui doit normalement \u00eatre suivie pour l\u2019octroi des promotions au sein de la fonction publique n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance dans ces rares cas o\u00f9 des promotions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es pour des motifs discriminatoires et o\u00f9 un tribunal, exer\u00e7ant la comp\u00e9tence qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Loi, ordonne qu\u2019une promotion soit accord\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne afin de corriger les effets de l\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019employeur. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je fais mienne l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du juge Dickson, alors juge pu\u00een\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Kelso c. La Reine, [1981] 1 R.C.S. 199, o\u00f9 il a dit \u00e0 la page 207 :\nPersonne ne conteste le droit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du gouvernement de r\u00e9partir les ressources et les effectifs comme il le juge appropri\u00e9. Mais ce droit n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9. Son exercice doit respecter la loi. Le droit du gouvernement de r\u00e9partir les ressources ne peut l\u2019emporter sur une loi telle que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, S.C. 1976-77, ch. 33, ou sur un r\u00e8glement tel que le D\u00e9cret d\u2019exclusion.\nComme l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de M. Uzoaba, il serait facile, et correct, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de reformuler ce qu\u2019a dit le juge Dickson de la mani\u00e8re suivante : \u00ab Personne ne conteste le droit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du gouvernement d\u2019accorder des promotions en fonction du principe du m\u00e9rite. Mais ce droit n\u2019est pas illimit\u00e9. Son exercice doit respecter la loi. Le droit du gouvernement d\u2019accorder des promotions en fonction du m\u00e9rite ne peut l\u2019emporter sur une loi telle que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. \u00bb\nComme l\u2019a dit le juge en chef Dickson dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes, toute autre conclusion minimiserait ou diminuerait l\u2019effet des droits garantis par la Loi. Voir \u00e0 la page 1134.\nDe plus, comme l\u2019a fait remarquer l\u2019avocat de la Commission des droits de la personne, si la Loi n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance dans un cas comme l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le pouvoir d\u2019un tribunal d\u2019ordonner le r\u00e9tablissement \u00e0 un niveau sup\u00e9rieur s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 des postes non gouvernementaux lorsque la Loi est applicable, mais non \u00e0 des postes gouvernementaux. Le l\u00e9gislateur ne peut pas avoir envisag\u00e9 de cr\u00e9er une telle anomalie.\n(Uzoaba, aux paragraphes 17 \u00e0 23.)\n[114] La d\u00e9cision Uzoaba renforce la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi lorsque celle-ci entre en conflit avec un autre texte de loi, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne. Cependant, comme le conflit de lois a pris naissance dans le contexte de mesures de redressement, la d\u00e9cision Uzoaba ne donne pas d\u2019indications sur le fait de savoir s\u2019il est possible de contester un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi parce qu\u2019il est question de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb. \u00c0 l\u2019instar des arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque, la d\u00e9cision Uzoaba est plut\u00f4t instructive quant au type de situation dans laquelle un autre texte de loi peut entrer en conflit avec une loi sur les droits de la personne.\nLes motifs dissidents dans les arr\u00eats Bhinder et Cooper [115] Les motifs dissidents du juge en chef Dickson et du juge Lamer (tel \u00e9tait alors leur titre) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bhinder, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Uzoaba, renforcent la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi dans le cas d\u2019un conflit avec un autre texte de loi :\nDans le pr\u00e9sent pourvoi, les dispositions du Code canadien du travail et de ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application ne cr\u00e9ent pas d\u2019exception aux dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Le port du casque de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 par les Sikhs, une exigence qui a un effet discriminatoire en apparence, est une question r\u00e9gie par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et non par le Code canadien du travail, lorsque les exigences des deux lois entrent en conflit. Ainsi, m\u00eame si la politique du port d\u2019un casque de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire en vertu du Code canadien du travail et de ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application, il ne s\u2019ensuit pas que cette politique est par le fait m\u00eame une exigence professionnelle normale pour les fins de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. En cons\u00e9quence, le tribunal avait comp\u00e9tence pour ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019employeur d\u2019exempter M. Bhinder de l\u2019application de la politique du port d\u2019un casque de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour le motif que cette politique ne satisfaisait pas aux exigences de l\u2019al. 14a) de la Loi.\n(Bhinder, \u00e0 la page 575.)\nCependant, les motifs dissidents ne traitent pas du fait de savoir s\u2019il est possible de contester un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi en tant que \u00ab service \u00bb.\n[116] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, les motifs dissidents des juges McLachlin et L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 J. (tel \u00e9tait alors leur titre) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper font une analogie entre la conclusion que le Tribunal a tir\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Druken (\u00e0 savoir que l\u2019adoption de la Loi avait implicitement abrog\u00e9 la disposition l\u00e9gale en cause) et le pouvoir qu\u2019a la Commission d\u2019examiner des questions de droit :\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on fait valoir que c\u2019est une disposition de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne -\u2011 la disposition relative au moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur \u00ab l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur \u00bb \u2011- qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 implicitement abrog\u00e9e par la Charte. Du point de vue de la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission, toutefois, il n\u2019existe pas de distinction entre la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce et l\u2019affaire Druken. Si les appelants ont raison, l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982 a implicitement abrog\u00e9 ce moyen de d\u00e9fense. Pour d\u00e9cider si une plainte est valide, la Commission doit d\u00e9terminer si cet argument est bien fond\u00e9. Suivant le principe \u00e9tabli dans Douglas College et appliqu\u00e9 dans Re Shewchuk et Druken, la Commission a le pouvoir d\u2019examiner cette question dans l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de son mandat consistant \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de rejeter la plainte ou de la d\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 un tribunal.\n(Cooper, au paragraphe 101.)\nL\u00e0 encore, ces motifs dissidents ne traitent pas de la question de savoir s\u2019il est possible de contester un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi en tant que \u00ab service \u00bb.\nLa conclusion sur d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles f\u00e9d\u00e9rales rendues avant l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy [117] L\u2019affirmation de la Commission selon laquelle plusieurs d\u00e9cisions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne reconnaissent que la Loi a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur d\u2019autres lois incompatibles est correcte. Cependant, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t en rapport avec les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, le fait d\u2019avoir pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance ne veut pas dire que la Loi autorise les plaintes qui contestent le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, sauf s\u2019il existe un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi. On ne rel\u00e8ve pas non plus dans ces arr\u00eats de commentaires indiquant le contraire.\n[118] Le fondement du conflit de lois, dans des affaires telles que Druken, Gonzalez et McAllister-Windsor, avait d\u00e9but\u00e9 par une plainte concernant l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens de la Loi, commis dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb. L\u00e0 encore, je suis d\u2019avis que ces affaires concordent en fait avec la d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, en ce sens que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a prescrit qu\u2019il devait y avoir un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, pour que la plainte soit valide dans cette affaire.\n(iii) La jurisprudence provinciale reconnaissant la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne [119] Selon la Commission, chaque fois qu\u2019il est possible de le faire, il convient d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter de mani\u00e8re uniforme les lois sur les droits de la personne du Canada tout entier, compte tenu de leurs similitudes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, de leur statut quasi constitutionnel ainsi que de leur objectif commun, soit la pr\u00e9vention de la discrimination. De ce fait, pour ce qui est d\u2019examiner si la Loi autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes qui visent \u00e0 toutes fins pratiques le libell\u00e9 d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la Commission exhorte le Tribunal \u00e0 examiner la jurisprudence d\u2019autres provinces du Canada. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle soutient qu\u2019il existe de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions qui suivent les indications que la Cour supr\u00eame a donn\u00e9es dans des arr\u00eats tels que Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne, de m\u00eame que dans la s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles f\u00e9d\u00e9rales qui portent sur l\u2019affaire Druken. Selon la Commission, dans ces affaires, les d\u00e9cideurs ont admis que : (i) les mesures que prennent des intervenants gouvernementaux en vertu de dispositions l\u00e9gales imp\u00e9ratives peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des \u00ab services \u00bb pour les besoins d\u2019un examen relatif aux droits de la personne et\/ou (ii) il est possible d\u2019utiliser les lois sur les droits de la personne, qui sont de nature quasi constitutionnelle, pour rendre inop\u00e9rants des textes de loi incompatibles.\n[120] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal aux d\u00e9cisions provinciales suivantes : Ontario (Disability Support Program) c. Tranchemontagne, 2010 ONCA 593 [Tranchemontagne (C.A. Ont.)]; Ball c. Ontario (Minister of Community and Social Services), 2010 HRTO 360 [Ball]; Hendershott c.

No. 4 (QL) [AA].\n[121] Je conviens, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, que les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne, de m\u00eame que la s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles f\u00e9d\u00e9rales Druken, pr\u00e9voient que l\u2019on peut appliquer les lois sur les droits de la personne, qui sont de nature quasi constitutionnelle, en vue de rendre inop\u00e9rants des textes de loi incompatibles, mais, comme je l'ai aussi mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, selon moi, ces d\u00e9cisions n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas la th\u00e8se selon laquelle la Loi autorise \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une plainte qui vise concr\u00e8tement le libell\u00e9 d\u2019une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Pour qu\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi soit valide, il faut plut\u00f4t que, dans chaque affaire, le plaignant rel\u00e8ve un acte discriminatoire, au sens de la Loi. La jurisprudence provinciale que la Commission a mentionn\u00e9e concorde \u00e9galement avec ce raisonnement :\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab Le TAS a conclu que les intim\u00e9s se sont vus priv\u00e9s d\u2019un service offert \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes handicap\u00e9es \u00bb (Tranchemontagne (C.A. Ont.), au paragraphe 50);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab Je signale au d\u00e9part que les parties ne contestent pas que la fourniture de prestations dans le cadre du Programme de l\u2019allocation pour r\u00e9gime alimentaire sp\u00e9cial est un \u201cservice\u201d au sens du Code [\u2026] \u00bb (Ball, au paragraphe 61);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab Nul ne conteste que la fourniture de prestations gouvernementales est un service \u00bb (Hendershott, au paragraphe 69);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 mon avis, la pr\u00e9sente demande a trait \u00e0 des services au sens du Code, et rel\u00e8ve de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Je suis convaincu que la loi en question, qui concerne la r\u00e9glementation d\u2019\u00e9tablissements titulaires d\u2019une licence, est cens\u00e9e profiter au public, et, en particulier, aux membres du personnel et aux clients de ces \u00e9tablissements en Ontario, y compris le requ\u00e9rant \u00bb (Ivancicevic, au paragraphe 150);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab Dans ces circonstances, il est clair que lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournit des certificats de naissance en vertu de la VSA, elle procure une sorte d\u2019avantage \u00e0 une personne ou au public, et elle fournit donc un \u201cservice\u201d au sens de l\u2019article premier du Code \u00bb (XY, au paragraphe 87);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re est un service offert au public en vertu du paragraphe 12(1) du Code \u00bb (Chambers, \u00e0 la page 28);\n\u2022 la conclusion selon laquelle le paiement de prestations d\u2019assurance-salaire \u00e9tait un service n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivie en appel (voir Wiebe, aux paragraphes 3 et 4);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, le fait que Mme Neubauer n\u2019a pas le droit d\u2019\u00eatre nomm\u00e9e au tribunal de l\u2019EAA est li\u00e9 \u00e0 un emploi potentiel. Mme Neubauer a \u00e9galement fait valoir que le fait d\u2019avoir le droit d\u2019\u00eatre pris en consid\u00e9ration en vue d\u2019une nomination est un service habituellement offert au public. Le Minist\u00e8re n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019observations sur la question. Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, je tiendrai pour acquis que la plainte de Mme Neubauer pourrait, s\u2019il est conclu qu\u2019elle est justifi\u00e9e, constituer une contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 8 du Code \u00bb (Neubauer, au paragraphe 61);\n\u2022 [traduction] \u00ab En cons\u00e9quence, les questions vis\u00e9es ici \u2013 l\u2019enregistrement des naissances et l\u2019adoption \u2013 doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme correspondant au sens du terme \u201cservices\u201d, au paragraphe 5(1) de la Loi sur les droits de la personne du Nouveau\u2011Brunswick \u00bb (AA, au paragraphe 29).\n[122] Dans la d\u00e9cision Gwinner, m\u00eame si la Cour a indiqu\u00e9 que la disposition de la loi sur les droits de la personne qui s\u2019applique dans cette affaire prescrit que nul ne peut [traduction] \u00ab refuser \u00e0 quiconque des services habituellement offerts au public \u00bb, la Cour et les parties n\u2019ont pas trait\u00e9 de la question de savoir s\u2019il existait un service dans les circonstances de l\u2019affaire :\n[traduction] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 3a) de la HRCMA prescrit que nul ne peut \u00ab refuser \u00e0 quiconque de services habituellement offerts au public, du fait de son \u00e9tat matrimonial \u00bb. La question \u00e0 se poser quand on examine s\u2019il y a violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue de cette disposition consiste \u00e0 savoir si la WPA refuse l\u2019octroi d\u2019une pension et de prestations en raison de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 3b) de la HRCMA prescrit que nul ne peut \u00ab commettre un acte discriminatoire \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de quiconque en rapport avec des services habituellement offerts au public, du fait de son \u00e9tat matrimonial. La question \u00e0 se poser quand on examine s\u2019il y a violation \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue de cette disposition consiste \u00e0 savoir si la WPA exerce une discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la fourniture d\u2019une pension et de prestations, du fait de l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial.\n(Gwinner, au paragraphe 90.)\n[123] Comme la question des services n\u2019est pas analys\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Gwinner, je ne trouve pas cette affaire particuli\u00e8rement convaincante ou utile dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[124] Dans la d\u00e9cision Nfld HRC, les plaignantes all\u00e9guaient qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient victimes de discrimination du fait de leur \u00e9tat matrimonial parce qu\u2019on les privait de leurs pensions de veuve respectives en cas de remariage. Une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les droits de la personne a conclu que la mesure de redressement que les plaignantes souhaitaient obtenir aurait pour effet de rendre invalide le paragraphe 65.1(1) de la Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Act. Elle a donc d\u00e9clin\u00e9 comp\u00e9tence au motif que le Human Rights Code de Terre-Neuve ne cr\u00e9ait pas de m\u00e9canisme permettant de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une loi provinciale cens\u00e9ment discriminatoire ou de l\u2019invalider. En appel, la Cour d\u2019appel de Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador ne s\u2019est pas souci\u00e9e du fond de la plainte, mais plut\u00f4t du fait de savoir si la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate pouvait ordonner une mesure de redressement qui \u00e9tait incompatible avec une directive contenue au paragraphe 65.1(1) de la Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Act (Nfld HRC, au paragraphe 9). Les juges majoritaires de la Cour d\u2019appel ont conclu :\n[traduction]\nLa commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale portant que le paragraphe 65.1(1) de la Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Act est inop\u00e9rant. Elle pouvait toutefois conclure que, par l\u2019application de l\u2019article 5 du Human Rights Code, une disposition d\u2019une autre loi ne pouvait pas avoir pour effet de justifier ce qui est \u00e9tait par ailleurs une conduite contraire au Human Rights Code. Une telle conclusion ne s\u2019appliquerait qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019affaire dans laquelle la d\u00e9cision aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. Une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate pourrait alors concevoir une mesure de redressement envisag\u00e9e par le Human Rights Code, ce qui pourrait inclure une directive obligeant \u00e0 mettre fin au comportement reproch\u00e9 et \u00e0 s\u2019abstenir de commettre une contravention \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, ou \u00e0 prendre d\u2019autres mesures qu\u2019autorise l\u2019article 28 du Human Rights Code, mais cela n\u2019irait pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser de quelle fa\u00e7on il faudrait proc\u00e9der pour rendre conforme la disposition l\u00e9gale attentatoire. Je conclus que l\u2019arbitre en chef et le juge de la Division de premi\u00e8re instance ont commis une erreur en d\u00e9cr\u00e9tant que la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder une mesure de redressement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n(Nfld HRC, au paragraphe 39.)\n[125] Comme ni la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate ni la Cour n\u2019ont trait\u00e9 du fond de l\u2019affaire, y compris des questions relatives aux services, je ne trouve pas non plus que cette affaire est particuli\u00e8rement convaincante ou utile dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle renforce, tout au plus, la primaut\u00e9 des affaires relatives aux droits de la personne, ce que \u00e0 quoi je souscris, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t.\n[126] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les affaires susmentionn\u00e9es peuvent \u00e9tayer la th\u00e8se selon laquelle \u00ab les mesures que prennent des intervenants gouvernementaux en vertu de dispositions l\u00e9gales imp\u00e9ratives peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des \u201cservices\u201d pour les besoins d\u2019un examen relatif aux droits de la personne \u00bb, je dirais que ces conclusions d\u00e9pendent des circonstances de ces affaires. Ainsi que l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin : \u00ab [i]l faut tenir compte des actes pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination pour pouvoir d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agit de \u201cservices\u201d[\u2026] \u00bb (au paragraphe 33). C\u2019est donc dire que, selon moi, les d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles provinciales que la Commission a invoqu\u00e9es, bien qu\u2019elles soient instructives et qu\u2019elles appuient le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne, n\u2019\u00e9tayent pas la th\u00e8se voulant que, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi, il soit possible de contester le libell\u00e9 d\u2019un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi, ou que la Loi autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes visant une conduite gouvernementale qui est obligatoire en vertu du libell\u00e9 d\u2019un texte de loi. Conform\u00e9ment aux arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame et \u00e0 la jurisprudence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t, un acte discriminatoire au sens de la loi provinciale applicable a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9 dans chacune des d\u00e9cisions provinciales applicables susmentionn\u00e9es.\n(iv) L\u2019article 2 et les paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1) de la Loi [127] La Commission souligne \u00e9galement le libell\u00e9 et l\u2019historique l\u00e9gislatif de plusieurs dispositions actuellement en vigueur de la Loi, qui d\u00e9montrent l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur de faire en sorte que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales : article 2 et paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1).\n[128] Selon la Commission, l\u2019article 2 de la Loi d\u00e9crit le but et les objets de cette derni\u00e8re en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, et rien de ce qui y figure ne donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019une conduite prescrite par une r\u00e8gle de droit est \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen quant \u00e0 sa conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 ces objets. Je signalerais par contre que cet article n\u2019indique pas explicitement non plus qu\u2019il est possible de contester en vertu de la Loi une conduite prescrite par un texte de loi. Par ailleurs, l\u2019argument qu\u2019invoque la Commission fait abstraction du reste du libell\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi. Le paragraphe 40(1) de cette derni\u00e8re dispose qu\u2019un individu peut d\u00e9poser une plainte si elle a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire. Selon l\u2019article 39 de la Loi, un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb d\u00e9signe tout acte vis\u00e9 aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi. Il n\u2019y a, dans ces articles, aucun acte discriminatoire qui permettrait l'examen d'un texte de loi afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est conforme \u00e0 la Loi.\n[129] En ce qui concerne le paragraphe 49(5), celui-ci exige que \u00ab [d]ans le cas o\u00f9 la plainte met en cause la compatibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition d\u2019une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou de ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application avec la pr\u00e9sente loi ou ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application \u00bb, cette plainte doit \u00eatre instruite par un membre du Tribunal qui est membre du barreau d\u2019une province ou de la Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec. Selon la Commission, cela d\u00e9montre que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait que les plaintes relatives \u00e0 une incompatibilit\u00e9 entre la Loi et une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pouvaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et tranch\u00e9es sur le fond. Cependant, l\u00e0 encore, l\u2019argument de la Commission fait abstraction du libell\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi et, en particulier, de l\u2019article 39 et du paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi. Le paragraphe 49(5) ne change ou n\u2019ajoute rien aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi.\n[130] Si la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, cela veut donc dire, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission, que le l\u00e9gislateur a parl\u00e9 pour ne rien dire quand il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 le paragraphe 49(5). La Commission soutient qu\u2019une telle approche enl\u00e8ve tout son sens au paragraphe 49(5) et qu\u2019il ne servirait \u00e0 rien de d\u00e9finir la composition de la formation qui instruirait une plainte visant un texte de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9ral si les plaintes de cette nature d\u00e9bordaient le cadre de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Selon la Commission, le paragraphe 49(5) indique qu\u2019une loi peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9e en vertu de la Loi, mais les premiers mots de cette disposition disent seulement : \u00ab [d]ans le cas o\u00f9 la plainte met en cause la compatibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition d\u2019une autre loi [\u2026] \u00bb ou, en anglais : \u00ab [i]f the complaint involves a question about whether another Act [\u2026] is inconsistent \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). Comme l\u2019illustrent des affaires telles que Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Uzoaba, il existe des situations \u00e9trang\u00e8res \u00e0 la contestation proprement dite d\u2019un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi o\u00f9 d\u2019autres dispositions l\u00e9gales peuvent \u00eatre incompatibles avec cette derni\u00e8re. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, cette jurisprudence ne permet pas non plus de conclure que le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne, dont semble traiter le paragraphe 49(5), est assimilable \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de contester un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi.\n[131] La Commission se fonde \u00e9galement sur des passages extraits des travaux r\u00e9alis\u00e9s au Parlement qui ont men\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ajout du paragraphe 49(5) \u00e0 la Loi comme preuve de la reconnaissance et de l\u2019acceptation, par le gouvernement, que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois. Mon interpr\u00e9tation de ces passages m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 croire que l\u2019ajout du paragraphe 49(5) avait principalement pour objet de faire en sorte que ce soient des avocats qui tranchent les affaires mettant en cause des questions d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 de lois. Le raisonnement \u00e9tait que ces types d\u2019affaires pouvaient \u00eatre l\u00e9galistes et complexes et que le fait qu\u2019un avocat les tranche aiderait \u00e0 les r\u00e9gler avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je suis donc d\u2019avis qu\u2019il serait utile qu\u2019il y ait une repr\u00e9sentation juridique au tribunal et que cela aiderait \u00e0 trancher avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 certaines de ces questions de droit, de preuve et de proc\u00e9dure complexes \u00bb (proc\u00e8s-verbaux et t\u00e9moignages du Comit\u00e9 permanent de la justice et des droits de la personne, dat\u00e9s du 12 mars 1998, d\u00e9claration du ministre de la Justice et Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada). Cela est logique, vu que le paragraphe 49(5) est situ\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du paragraphe 49(2) de la Loi, lequel pr\u00e9voit que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut d\u00e9signer trois membres s\u2019il estime que la difficult\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire le justifie. M\u00eame si certains hauts responsables ont \u00e9galement fait des commentaires sur les types d\u2019affaires soumises au Tribunal, y compris le pouvoir qu\u2019a ce dernier de rendre un texte de loi inop\u00e9rant, ces commentaires n\u2019indiquent pas que le paragraphe 49(5) visait un objectif autre que celui de faire en sorte que des avocats si\u00e8gent dans les affaires de ce type. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 49(5), de pair avec son emplacement dans le cadre de la Loi et l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait le l\u00e9gislateur en l\u2019ajoutant, je suis d\u2019avis que ce paragraphe n\u2019\u00e9taye pas l\u2019argument de la Commission selon lequel la Loi autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes visant le libell\u00e9 d\u2019un autre texte de loi.\n[132] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de son argumentation, la Commission attire \u00e9galement l\u2019attention sur le paragraphe 62(1) de la Loi. Cette disposition comporte une exception l\u00e9gislative par rapport aux parties I et II de la Loi dans le cas des r\u00e9gimes ou des caisses de retraite constitu\u00e9s par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ant\u00e9rieure au 1er mars 1978. Selon la Commission, sans cette exception, la Loi se serait appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 n\u2019importe quelle disposition discriminatoire figurant dans les lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de retraite ou de pension. L\u00e0 encore, toutefois, l\u2019argument de la Commission fait abstraction du libell\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, de son article 39 et de son paragraphe 40(1). Le paragraphe 62(1) ne change ou n\u2019ajoute rien aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi.\n[133] Une fois de plus, la Commission fait valoir aussi que si la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, cela signifie que le l\u00e9gislateur a parl\u00e9 en vain quand il a adopt\u00e9 le paragraphe 62(1) et que, en fait, cette disposition n\u2019a plus aucun sens. Toutefois, cet argument confond de nouveau la notion de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne et la capacit\u00e9 de contester un texte de loi, en tant qu\u2019acte discriminatoire, en vertu de la Loi. Comme nous l\u2019avons vu plus t\u00f4t, rien n\u2019indique dans la jurisprudence que la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne est assimilable \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de contester un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi.\n[134] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019a faite le 10 mars 1977 le ministre de la Justice de l\u2019\u00e9poque sur l\u2019inclusion du paragraphe 62(1) \u00e0 la Loi, d\u00e9claration sur laquelle se fonde la Commission, ne signifie pas que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi. Les commentaires du ministre m\u2019indiquent que l\u2019inclusion de cette disposition \u00e9tait une mesure de pr\u00e9caution, destin\u00e9e \u00e0 se pr\u00e9munir contre la possibilit\u00e9 que la Loi rende inop\u00e9rants certains aspects des r\u00e9gimes de retraite gouvernementaux : [traduction] \u00ab Il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de modifier certains de ces r\u00e9gimes afin d\u2019assurer leur compatibilit\u00e9 avec le projet de loi C\u201125 \u00bb (d\u00e9claration du ministre de la Justice au Comit\u00e9 permanent de la justice et des questions juridiques, Chambre des communes, 10 mars 1977; non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019explication qu\u2019a donn\u00e9e la Commission au sujet des r\u00e9percussions de ce passage :\n[traduction]\nCe passage implique que, sans l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue par la loi, les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la LCDP auraient pu mener \u00e0 des modifications h\u00e2tives aux clauses de r\u00e9gimes de retraite \u00e9tablis par voie l\u00e9gislative. Dans les circonstances, le l\u00e9gislateur a pris des mesures pr\u00e9cises pour garantir qu\u2019il conservait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019apporter \u00e0 son propre rythme les modifications souhait\u00e9es.\n(Observations \u00e9crites de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vue du premier volet de l\u2019audience du Tribunal (qui sera tenue du 30 janvier au 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013), 11 janvier 2013, au paragraphe 74, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[135] Compte tenu de l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, c\u2019est donc dire que, \u00e0 mon sens, l\u2019article 2 et les paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1) de la Loi ne montrent pas que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\n(v) L\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi [136] Selon les plaignants, l\u2019intention et l\u2019objet qui sous-tendaient l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 \u00e9taient d\u2019ouvrir l\u2019ensemble de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 un examen complet en vertu de la Loi. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission soutient que l\u2019ancien article 67 agissait comme une exception l\u00e9gale au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne. L\u2019existence de l\u2019article 67 impliquait que, sans l\u2019exception, la Loi se serait appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 toute disposition discriminatoire figurant dans la Loi sur les Indiens et l\u2019aurait touch\u00e9e. En fait, la Commission est d\u2019avis que le l\u00e9gislateur a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019ancien article 67 dans le but de mettre les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen en vertu de la Loi. En abrogeant l\u2019article 67 en 2008, le l\u00e9gislateur entendait donc ouvrir la voie aux plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne qui visaient des aspects discriminatoires de ces m\u00eames dispositions.\n[137] L\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi disposait :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\n[138] Comme c\u2019est le cas pour l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 62(1), je conviens que l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi agissait comme une exception l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que la Loi ait primaut\u00e9 sur la Loi sur les Indiens et rende donc certaines de ses dispositions inop\u00e9rantes. Comme l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 avec justesse la Commission dans ses observations :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il ressort du dossier qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque - en 1977 - o\u00f9 le Parlement \u00e9tudiait les dispositions l\u00e9gales qui allaient plus tard devenir la LCDP, on s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 ne pas modifier la Loi sur les Indiens sans consulter les peuples autochtones. De ce fait, le ministre des Affaires indiennes avait demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on inclue dans la LCDP une exception qui dispenserait la Loi sur les Indiens d\u2019un examen relatif aux droits de la personne. Le gouvernement a exprim\u00e9 son accord et a inclus la clause 63(2) (la disposition qui allait finalement devenir l\u2019article 67), dans l\u2019intention avou\u00e9e de s\u2019assurer que la \u00ab Loi sur les Indiens ne sera pas, en fait, modifi\u00e9e par cette loi \u00bb pendant que les consultations avec les repr\u00e9sentants des autochtones se poursuivaient.\n(Observations \u00e9crites de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne en vue du premier volet de l\u2019audience du Tribunal (qui sera tenue du 30 janvier au 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013), 11 janvier 2013, au paragraphe 80.)\n[139] Cependant, comme nous l\u2019avons vu plus t\u00f4t, le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne ne veut pas dire que l\u2019on peut contester le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois en vertu de la Loi, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de cette derni\u00e8re. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019argument qu\u2019invoquent les plaignants et la Commission fait encore abstraction du libell\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie de la Loi et, en particulier, de l\u2019article 39 et du paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi. L\u2019inclusion de l\u2019ancien article 67 \u00e0 la Loi n\u2019a rien chang\u00e9 ou ajout\u00e9 aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi.\n[140] La Commission va plus loin que cela et pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019article 67 a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment inclus parce que le gouvernement avait le sentiment que les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens violaient la Loi. Selon elle, une fois que l\u2019on admet que le l\u00e9gislateur a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019article 67 dans le but de mettre les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 l\u2019abri de tout examen en vertu de la Loi, il faut aussi admettre qu\u2019en abrogeant l\u2019article 67, le l\u00e9gislateur entendait ouvrir la voie aux plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne qui visaient des aspects discriminatoires de ces m\u00eames dispositions.\n[141] Comme dans le cas de l\u2019inclusion de l\u2019article 67 dans l\u2019ancienne Loi, l\u2019abrogation de cette disposition n\u2019a, elle non plus, rien chang\u00e9 ou ajout\u00e9 aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi. L\u2019abrogation de cette disposition n\u2019exempte plus les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens, ni aucune disposition \u00e9tablie sous le r\u00e9gime de cette loi, de tout conflit possible avec cette derni\u00e8re; cependant, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 analys\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, ce conflit doit \u00eatre attribuable \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire, au sens de la Loi. J\u2019ajouterais qu\u2019\u00e0 part l\u2019accent mis par la Commission sur les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 autorise de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes contestant les actions et les d\u00e9cisions prises en vertu des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens, que ce soit par le gouvernement ou par les organismes des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\n[142] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 de la Loi ne montre pas non plus que l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\n(vi) La conclusion : la plainte est rejet\u00e9e [143] Les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne \u00e9tayent la pr\u00e9tention des plaignants et de la Commission selon laquelle les lois sur les droits de la personne ont pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur d\u2019autres lois incompatibles et, de ce fait, peuvent faire en sorte qu\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gale qui entre en conflit avec elles soient inop\u00e9rantes. Cela concorde \u00e9galement avec d\u2019autres affaires f\u00e9d\u00e9rales concernant les droits de la personne, telles que Druken, Gonzalez, McAllister-Windsor et Uzoaba, ainsi que d\u2019autres affaires provinciales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, qui se sont servies d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne pour rendre inop\u00e9rantes des dispositions l\u00e9gales incompatibles. Cependant, m\u00eame si ces affaires \u00e9tayent le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne et la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ont de rendre les dispositions l\u00e9gales inop\u00e9rantes, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser dans ces affaires que la Loi autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes qui visent le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois.\n[144] Le fondement du conflit entre les dispositions l\u00e9gales applicables dans les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque et les affaires f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales que les plaignants et la Commission ont invoqu\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9 sous la forme de plaintes de \u00ab discrimination \u00bb aux termes de la loi sur les droits de la personne qui s\u2019appliquait dans ces affaires. Les plaintes elles\u2011m\u00eames ne visaient pas le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois. Un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, au sens de la loi applicable, \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent.\n[145] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que des individus peuvent d\u00e9poser une plainte s\u2019ils ont des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un acte discriminatoire. Selon l\u2019article 39 de la Loi, un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb s\u2019entend d\u2019un acte vis\u00e9 aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi. Il n\u2019existe dans ces articles aucun acte discriminatoire qui pr\u00e9voit l\u2019examen d\u2019un texte de loi en vue de d\u00e9terminer sa conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi.\n[146] M\u00eame si la Commission a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019article 2 et les paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1) de la Loi montrent que le l\u00e9gislateur entendait que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, ces dispositions ne changent ou n\u2019ajoutent rien aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi. Les paragraphes 49(5) et 62(1) traitent peut-\u00eatre de la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi en cas de conflit avec d\u2019autres textes de loi f\u00e9d\u00e9raux mais, l\u00e0 encore, le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne ne veut pas dire qu\u2019il est possible de contester un texte de loi en vertu de la Loi, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire.\n[147] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, l\u2019inclusion et l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi n\u2019ont rien chang\u00e9 ou ajout\u00e9 aux actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi. Dans le m\u00eame sens que le paragraphe 62(1), l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi agissait comme une exception l\u00e9gale \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 que la Loi ait pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur la Loi sur les Indiens et que, de ce fait, elle rende inop\u00e9rante certaines de ses dispositions. L\u00e0 encore, toutefois, le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois sur les droits de la personne ne veut pas dire que le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois peut \u00eatre contest\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\n[148] Au vu du raisonnement qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne conclus pas que l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy est supplant\u00e9 par des arr\u00eats jurisprudentiels de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Je ne trouve pas non plus de sources \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la th\u00e8se voulant que la Loi autorise le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes contestant l\u2019effet discriminatoire d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi. \u00c0 mon avis, les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque, de m\u00eame que les affaires f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et provinciales que les plaignants et la Commission ont invoqu\u00e9es, concordent en fait avec la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a rendue la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Murphy. \u00c0 l\u2019instar de l\u2019analyse faite dans ces affaires, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a prescrit qu\u2019il devait y avoir un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, pour que le Tribunal ait comp\u00e9tence. De plus, les commentaires que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a formul\u00e9s dans cet arr\u00eat ne mettent pas en doute la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi en cas de conflit avec un autre texte de loi.\n[149] Cependant, l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy pr\u00e9cise toutefois que la contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, n\u2019est pas un service et, de ce fait, n\u2019est pas un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi. Jusqu\u2019au prononc\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, dans le cadre d\u2019affaires telles que Forward et Watkin, la compr\u00e9hension judiciaire du terme \u00ab services \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 clarifi\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la juste m\u00e9thode d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois sur les droits de la personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Action Travail des Femmes et Tranchemontagne (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin, au paragraphe 34). Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, ni les plaignants ni la Commission n\u2019ont contest\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que l\u2019on applique \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle pour d\u00e9terminer si une conduite s\u2019applique \u00e0 un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[150] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est une contestation d\u2019un texte de loi, et rien d\u2019autre, que l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy n\u2019est pas supplant\u00e9 par la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et que la Loi n\u2019autorise pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes visant l\u2019effet discriminatoire d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi, de ce fait, vu que les plaignants n\u2019ont pas relev\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, la pr\u00e9sente plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nC. La plainte met-elle en cause un acte discriminatoire commis dans le cadre de la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public et susceptible de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une conclusion de discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi? [151] Compte tenu de la conclusion formul\u00e9e ci-dessus, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re question est n\u00e9gative.\n[152] Comme les plaignants tentent de contrer l\u2019application d\u2019un texte de loi, une contestation de nature constitutionnelle serait le meilleur moyen d\u2019obtenir le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019ils souhaitent, eu \u00e9gard surtout \u00e0 leur pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle leur cause suscite un int\u00e9r\u00eat public consid\u00e9rable. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, il y a une nette diff\u00e9rence entre une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte et une plainte fond\u00e9e sur la Loi :\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Cour doit aborder la question de la discrimination au sens o\u00f9 ce terme est utilis\u00e9 au par. 15(1) de la Charte. De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on peut affirmer que les principes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9s en vertu des lois sur les droits de la personne s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019examen des questions de discrimination au sens du par. 15(1). Il faut cependant tenir compte de certaines distinctions qui d\u00e9coulent de la diff\u00e9rence entre la Charte et les lois sur les droits de la personne. D\u2019abord, la discrimination dont il est question au par. 15(1) est restreinte \u00e0 celle qui d\u00e9coule de l\u2019application de la loi alors que les lois sur les droits de la personne s\u2019appliquent aussi aux activit\u00e9s de nature priv\u00e9e. [\u2026]\n[\u2026]\nLorsque les lois sur les droits de la personne interdisent la discrimination, elles le font de mani\u00e8re absolue et lorsqu\u2019elles pr\u00e9voient un moyen de d\u00e9fense ou une exception, c\u2019est \u00e9galement en termes absolus et la discrimination est alors permise. Il n\u2019y a pas de moyen terme \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Dans la Charte toutefois, bien que le par. 15(1), sous r\u00e9serve du par. (2), interdise la discrimination de mani\u00e8re absolue, l\u2019article premier permet que des limites raisonnables soient apport\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019application du par. 15(1). Le paragraphe 15(1) exige donc une interpr\u00e9tation diff\u00e9rente. Bien que la discrimination au sens du par. 15(1) soit de m\u00eame nature et corresponde sur le plan de sa description au concept de discrimination \u00e9labor\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des lois sur les droits de la personne, une autre \u00e9tape devra \u00eatre franchie pour d\u00e9cider si des lois discriminatoires peuvent \u00eatre justifi\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019article premier. Il appartiendra \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tat d\u2019\u00e9tablir cela. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une \u00e9tape distincte n\u00e9cessaire en vertu de la Charte et que l\u2019on ne trouve pas dans la plupart des lois sur les droits de la personne parce que dans ces lois la justification de la discrimination r\u00e9side g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement dans des exceptions aux droits fondamentaux.\n(Andrews, aux pages 175 et 176.)\n[153] Si les plaignants avaient \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, alors l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) de la Loi aurait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de montrer que ses actions avaient un motif justifiable. Le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi dispose que, pour qu\u2019il y ait un motif justifiable, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00e9tablir que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de personnes telles que les plaignants constitueraient une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Cependant, comme l\u2019ont expliqu\u00e9 les juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hutterian Brethren, l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la notion d\u2019accommodement ne convient pas dans les cas o\u00f9 la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une loi est en jeu :\n\u00c0 mon avis, il faut maintenir la distinction entre l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur la notion d\u2019accommodement raisonnable pour l\u2019application de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne et la justification en application de l\u2019article premier d\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative contraire \u00e0 la Charte. Quand la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative est en cause, il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019analyse requise par l\u2019article premier d\u00e9crite dans Oakes. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019atteinte minimale, cette m\u00e9thode d\u2019analyse veut que l\u2019on d\u00e9termine s\u2019il est possible de concevoir une mani\u00e8re moins attentatoire d\u2019atteindre l\u2019objectif. La pond\u00e9ration des effets n\u2019a lieu qu\u2019\u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de la proportionnalit\u00e9. Si le gouvernement r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 justifier la mesure l\u00e9gislative selon le test \u00e9tabli dans Oakes, cette mesure est constitutionnelle. Sinon, elle est inop\u00e9rante, par application de l\u2019art. 52, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle est incompatible avec la Charte.\nUne analyse diff\u00e9rente s\u2019applique lorsque le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019un acte gouvernemental ou une pratique administrative porte atteinte \u00e0 un droit que lui garantit la Charte. Si le tribunal conclut que l\u2019acte ou la pratique en cause contrevient \u00e0 la Charte, son pouvoir de r\u00e9paration rel\u00e8ve non pas de l\u2019art. 52 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, mais du par. 24(1) de la Charte : R. c. Ferguson, 2008 CSC 6, [2008] 1 R.C.S. 96, par. 61. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, la jurisprudence concernant l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement, qui s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux parties priv\u00e9es et aux gouvernements, peut \u00eatre utile \u00ab pour bien saisir le fardeau qu\u2019impose le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019atteinte minimale vis-\u00e0-vis d\u2019un individu en particulier \u00bb (je souligne) : Multani, par. 53, la juge Charron.\nL\u2019atteinte minimale et l\u2019accommodement raisonnable sont distincts sur le plan conceptuel. L\u2019accommodement raisonnable est un concept qui d\u00e9coule de la l\u00e9gislation et de la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un processus dynamique par lequel les parties \u2014 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un employeur et un employ\u00e9 \u2014 adaptent les modalit\u00e9s de leur relation aux exigences de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, jusqu\u2019au point o\u00f9 il en r\u00e9sulterait une contrainte excessive pour la partie tenue de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Dans Multani, les juges Deschamps et Abella ont expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLe processus impos\u00e9 par l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement raisonnable tient compte des circonstances pr\u00e9cises dans lesquelles les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s doivent \u00e9voluer et laisse place \u00e0 la discussion entre ces derniers. Cette concertation leur permet de se rapprocher et de trouver un terrain d\u2019entente adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs propres besoins. [par. 131]\nIl existe une relation tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente entre le l\u00e9gislateur et les personnes assujetties \u00e0 ses mesures l\u00e9gislatives. De par leur nature, les mesures l\u00e9gislatives d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne sont pas adapt\u00e9es aux besoins particuliers de chacun. Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a ni le pouvoir ni l\u2019obligation en droit de prendre des d\u00e9cisions aussi personnalis\u00e9es et, dans bien des cas, il ne conna\u00eet pas \u00e0 l\u2019avance le risque qu\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative porte atteinte aux droits garantis par la Charte. On ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il adapte les mesures l\u00e9gislatives \u00e0 toute \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 toute croyance religieuse sinc\u00e8re. Les mesures l\u00e9gislatives d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne visent pas uniquement les plaignants, mais l\u2019ensemble de la population. L\u2019ensemble du contexte social dans lequel s\u2019applique la mesure l\u00e9gislative doit \u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019analyse de la justification requise par l\u2019article premier. La constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte d\u00e9pend, non pas de la question de savoir si elle r\u00e9pond aux besoins de chacun des plaignants, mais plut\u00f4t de celle de savoir si la restriction aux droits garantis par la Charte vise un objectif important et si l\u2019effet global de cette restriction est proportionn\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il ne fasse aucun doute que l\u2019effet de la mesure l\u00e9gislative sur les plaignants constitue un facteur important dont le tribunal doit tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si la violation est justifi\u00e9e, le tribunal doit avant tout prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il doit se demander si la contravention \u00e0 la Charte peut se justifier dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, et non s\u2019il est possible d\u2019envisager un am\u00e9nagement plus avantageux pour un plaignant en particulier.\nDe m\u00eame, la \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb, notion essentielle de l\u2019accommodement raisonnable, ne s\u2019applique pas facilement \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature qui adopte les mesures l\u00e9gislatives. Dans le contexte des droits de la personne, la contrainte est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme excessive si elle menace la viabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise tenue de s\u2019adapter au droit. Le degr\u00e9 de contrainte peut souvent se traduire en termes p\u00e9cuniaires. En revanche, il est difficile d\u2019appliquer la notion de contrainte excessive en ces termes \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation ou \u00e0 la non\u2011r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objectif l\u00e9gislatif, surtout quand il s\u2019agit (comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) d\u2019un objectif de pr\u00e9vention. Bien qu\u2019il soit possible de donner \u00e0 la notion de \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb une interpr\u00e9tation large qui englobe la contrainte d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019atteindre un objectif gouvernemental urgent, une telle interpr\u00e9tation att\u00e9nue cette notion. Plut\u00f4t que d\u2019essayer d\u2019adapter la notion de \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb au contexte de l\u2019article premier de la Charte, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de parler d\u2019atteinte minimale et de proportionnalit\u00e9 des effets.\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, quand la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale est en jeu, l\u2019accommodement raisonnable ne saurait se substituer \u00e0 l\u2019analyse requise par l\u2019article premier telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans Oakes. Quand le gouvernement prend une mesure en \u00e9dictant une loi, les dispositions de l\u2019article premier s\u2019appliquent. Le gouvernement peut justifier la mesure l\u00e9gislative, non pas en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il l\u2019a adapt\u00e9e aux besoins du plaignant, mais en \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019elle a un lien rationnel avec un objectif urgent et r\u00e9el, qu\u2019elle porte le moins possible atteinte au droit et que son effet est proportionn\u00e9.\n(Hutterian Brethren, aux paragraphes 66 \u00e0 71.)\n[154] C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019outre le fait de d\u00e9cider qu\u2019une loi n\u2019est pas un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, les commentaires des juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada donneraient aussi \u00e0 penser que l\u2019\u00e9conomie et le cadre analytique de la Loi ne sont pas un moyen appropri\u00e9 d\u2019analyser les aspects discriminatoires pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le gouvernement est en droit de justifier l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, non pas en montrant l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif justifiable au sens du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, mais en \u00e9tablissant que toute atteinte aux droits des plaignants peut se d\u00e9montrer dans le cadre d\u2019une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique au sens de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n[155] Pour tous ces motifs, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par :\nEdward P.

Contexte\n[1] Le 30 janvier 2005, la plaignante, Mme Janet Gover, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, plainte dans laquelle elle fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de violation des articles 7, 10 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[2] La plaignante mentionne ce qui suit au d\u00e9but de sa plainte :\n[traduction]\nJ\u2019ai des motifs raisonnables de croire que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et que mon employeur n\u2019a pris aucune mesure d\u2019adaptation qui tienne compte de ma d\u00e9ficience. J\u2019ai des motifs raisonnables de croire que j\u2019ai fait l\u2019objet de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s, de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement syst\u00e9miques. Par cons\u00e9quent, je renvoie (sans m\u2019y limiter) aux all\u00e9gations de violation des articles 7 (sept), 10 (dix) et 14 (quatorze) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[3] Pour une meilleure compr\u00e9hension du pr\u00e9sent dossier, je renvoie aux dispositions susmentionn\u00e9es de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6, lesquelles sont ainsi libell\u00e9es :\nArticle 7 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nArticle 10 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\nArticle 14 : (1) Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu :\na) lors de la fourniture de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public;\nb) lors de la fourniture de locaux commerciaux ou de logements;\nc) en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.\n(2) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (1) et sans qu\u2019en soit limit\u00e9e la port\u00e9e g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n1980-81-82-83, ch. 143, art. 7.\nArticle 14.1 : Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n1998, ch. 9, art. 14.\n[4] Avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate et \u00e0 l\u2019audition du dossier de la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9livrer une ordonnance afin de confirmer la port\u00e9e de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate figurant dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent jugement.\n[5] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de limiter l\u2019audition de la plainte de la plaignante \u00e0 la question de l\u2019appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et de ne pas discuter des questions relatives au traitement\/salaire.\n[6] Cette requ\u00eate est donc d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans le but avou\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un \u00e9claircissement quant au mandat qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) et de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nII. La requ\u00eate\nA. Requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[7] Dans la requ\u00eate qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Tribunal, l\u2019intim\u00e9e mentionne que la plainte originale de la plaignante soulevait deux questions devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne soit :\n(a) Traitement\/salaire;\n(b) Appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique;\n[8] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission a fait enqu\u00eate sur les deux volets de la plainte de la plaignante, mais n\u2019aurait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal que le volet \u00ab appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00bb, et ce, en se fondant sur le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate dont il est fait mention au paragraphe 14 de l\u2019affidavit de C. Deborah Hagarty, qui figure \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A, onglet B.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9e, toujours en se fondant sur le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission susmentionn\u00e9, d\u00e9clare ce qui suit au paragraphe 10 de son m\u00e9moire relatif \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate :\n[traduction]\nSur le fondement de ces conclusions, le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate comporte les recommandations suivantes :\nIl est recommand\u00e9 que la Commission, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, demande au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne d\u2019instruire la plainte parce que :\n\u00b7 la preuve indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a l\u00e9s\u00e9 la plaignante en refusant de doter son poste de travail d\u2019un appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n\u00b7 Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, il est justifi\u00e9 que le Tribunal fasse enqu\u00eate.\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9e mentionne ensuite ce qui suit au paragraphe 12 de son m\u00e9moire :\n[traduction]\nLa Commission a examin\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate ainsi que les observations produites par les parties en r\u00e9ponse au rapport. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 3 mai 2012, la Commission a avis\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer l\u2019affaire.\n[11] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e renvoie les parties \u00e0 la lettre de d\u00e9cision de la Commission, dont le libell\u00e9 est semblable \u00e0 celui du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, qui figure dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Hagarty, \u00e0 l\u2019onglet A. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une lettre de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante, madame Janet Gover, qui se lit comme suit :\n[traduction]\nMadame Gover :\nJe vous \u00e9cris pour vous informer de la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a rendue la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de votre plainte (20041101) contre l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers.\nAvant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission a examin\u00e9 le rapport qui vous avait \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 ainsi que les observations d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce rapport. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de demander \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits d\u2019instruire la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport au motif que :\nLa preuve indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a l\u00e9s\u00e9 la plaignante en refusant de doter son poste de travail d\u2019un appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique;\nCompte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal est justifi\u00e9e.\nDe plus amples renseignements vous seront communiqu\u00e9s par le Tribunal \u00e0 propos du d\u00e9roulement des proc\u00e9dures.\n[12] La question suivante constitue l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment central de l\u2019argumentation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\nLe renvoi au Tribunal porte-t-il uniquement sur la plainte relative \u00e0 la question de l\u2019appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique?\n[13] Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve dans son argumentation, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate, le point suivant :\n[traduction]\nLa Commission n\u2019a aucunement fait mention de la question du traitement\/salaire dans sa d\u00e9cision et elle mentionne que le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate constituera ses motifs. Sur cette question, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Sketchley c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 404, au paragraphe 37 (R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, page 7, paragraphe 22).\n[14] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en citant les d\u00e9cisions Powell c. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., 2006 TCDP 27, Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22 et la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2003 TCDP 32, mentionne que la jurisprudence du Tribunal reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est possible de ne renvoyer que certaines parties d\u2019une plainte.\n[15] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l\u2019intim\u00e9e mentionne que seule la question de l\u2019appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, car la question du traitement\/salaire n\u2019a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019aucune mention explicite, je renvoie aux paragraphes 33 et 34, \u00e0 la page 10 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[traduction]\n33. Comme la question du traitement\/salaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission, le Tribunal n\u2019en a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi aux fins d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence quant \u00e0 celle-ci. Si, malgr\u00e9 cela, le Tribunal permettait que la question du traitement\/salaire soit instruite, la fonction d\u2019examen de la Commission qui est pr\u00e9vue dans la Loi perdrait tout son sens.\n34. La Loi n\u2019accorde pas aux plaignants un acc\u00e8s direct au Tribunal. La Commission, qui est un organisme administratif, est charg\u00e9e de d\u00e9cider quelle plainte doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e, doit faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et\/ou doit \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Le Tribunal ne peut instruire que les plaintes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission.\n[16] Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que le Tribunal doit voir \u00e0 ce que les plaintes dont il est saisi soient trait\u00e9es rapidement compte tenu de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la lettre de la Commission, susmentionn\u00e9e, et que seule la question de l\u2019appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction au Tribunal; celui-ci n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la question du traitement\/salaire . L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que, si sa requ\u00eate \u00e9tait accueillie, les proc\u00e9dures engag\u00e9es dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier pourraient se d\u00e9rouler plus rapidement.\nB. R\u00e9ponse de la plaignante\n[17] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019argumentation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate, la plaignante affirme que le fait de ne pas avoir mentionn\u00e9 explicitement quelle partie de la plainte serait instruite d\u00e9montre que la Commission avait l\u2019intention de renvoyer dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante. Elle adopte donc une position contraire \u00e0 celle de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate.\n[18] La plaignante affirme \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission et que la Commission a clairement mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait tenu compte de tous les arguments qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s \u00ab ainsi que du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et des observations formul\u00e9es par les parties post\u00e9rieurement \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00bb.\n[19] Selon la plaignante, la jurisprudence de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale indique que la Commission doit \u00e9noncer et motiver clairement sa d\u00e9cision de rejeter les [traduction] \u00ab observations post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, surtout lorsque des omissions dans ces observations sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[20] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante renvoie \u00e0 la lettre du 3 mai 2012 qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e. Il convient de souligner que la plaignante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et qu\u2019elle a ult\u00e9rieurement abandonn\u00e9 cette plainte.\n[21] Dans sa conclusion, la plaignante affirme ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n50. La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal en se servant d\u2019une formulation large qui englobe toutes les parties de la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque l\u2019absence d\u2019un renvoi explicite pour pr\u00e9tendre que la question du traitement\/salaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Toutefois, cela n\u2019est pas compatible avec l\u2019importance des droits en litige, le r\u00f4le de la Commission, ou le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif \u00e9non\u00e7ant les pouvoirs de la Commission de renvoi et de rejet. Ces facteurs indiquent que la Commission doit utiliser des termes clairs et explicites lorsqu\u2019elle exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et son pouvoir de rejet. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019absence de termes explicites \u00e9non\u00e7ant le rejet d\u2019une quelconque partie de la plainte et le caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du renvoi d\u00e9montrent que la Commission avait l\u2019intention de renvoyer la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Si la Commission avait voulu rejeter la question du traitement\/salaire, elle l\u2019aurait clairement dit, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der.\n51. De plus, la Commission a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait tenu compte des observations formul\u00e9es par les parties apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate. La Commission n\u2019a en aucun temps dit qu\u2019elle rejetait l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre de ces observations, et on peut donc pr\u00e9sumer que celles-ci ont \u00e9clair\u00e9 la Commission dans son \u00e9valuation visant \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 de renvoyer l\u2019affaire pour instruction. L\u2019intim\u00e9e se fie enti\u00e8rement au rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur pour interpr\u00e9ter le renvoi de la Commission. Le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur est d\u2019une valeur limit\u00e9e sur le plan de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation si la Commission a tenu compte d\u2019autres observations.\n52. Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\nC. Position de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\n[22] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et en demande le rejet pour les raisons suivantes .\n[23] Dans son argumentation, la Commission renvoie \u00e0 deux lettres qu\u2019elle a envoy\u00e9es la m\u00eame journ\u00e9e, soit le 3 mai 2012; l\u2019une de ces lettres est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante et comporte la note suivante :\n[traduction]\nLa preuve indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a l\u00e9s\u00e9 la plaignante en refusant de doter son poste de travail d\u2019un appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique : et\nCompte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances de la plainte, l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal est justifi\u00e9e. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[24] De plus, la Commission renvoie \u00e0 une deuxi\u00e8me lettre, laquelle est dat\u00e9e du 3 mai 2012 et est adress\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne. La lettre est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nLe 3 mai 2012, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de Mme Gover au Tribunal pour instruction. La lettre du pr\u00e9sident int\u00e9rimaire au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal est instructive. Elle est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\nLa Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a examin\u00e9 la plainte (20041101) de Janet Gover contre l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada.\nLa Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte, car elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nAffidavit de Saikali, Dossier de requ\u00eate de la Commission, onglet 2, pi\u00e8ce \u00ab D \u00bb\n[25] La Commission r\u00e9it\u00e8re de fa\u00e7on non \u00e9quivoque que \u00ab la plainte de Mme Gover a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9, et non pas partiellement, au Tribunal afin que celui-ci l\u2019instruise, car rien dans la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et dans les lettres cit\u00e9es n\u2019indique que seule la \u00ab question de l\u2019appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour enqu\u00eate. (R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : observations de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, page 5, paragraphe 11).\n[26] Dans son argumentation, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux arr\u00eats Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22, et Lacroix c. GRC, 2009 TCDP 35. (Dossier de requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, onglets F et G).\n[27] La Commission attire l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur le fait que, selon elle, l\u2019argumentation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e vise en fait \u00e0 lui demander de r\u00e9viser le processus par lequel la Commission lui renvoie des plaintes. Or, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans Commission des droits de la personne c. Lemire et autres, 2012 CF 1162, aux paragraphes 52 \u00e0 58 (dossier de requ\u00eate de la Commission, onglet 5) a clairement affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas cette comp\u00e9tence.\n[28] La Commission affirme ce qui suit (observations de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, page 7) :\n[traduction]\n15. Nous pr\u00e9tendons que ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est en quelque sorte un examen du processus d\u00e9cisionnel de la Commission et de la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle a trait\u00e9 la plainte. Il s\u2019agit simplement d\u2019une attaque indirecte contre la Commission en ce qui concerne ses d\u00e9cisions et la mani\u00e8re selon laquelle elle a trait\u00e9 la plainte.\n16. Ce faisant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne tient pas compte des r\u00f4les distincts de la Commission et du Tribunal pr\u00e9vus dans la LCDP. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Halifax, les divers r\u00f4les et les diverses fonctions de la Commission \u00e0 titre d\u2019organisme administratif et du Tribunal \u00e0 titre d\u2019organisme juridictionnel. \u00c0 ce titre, le Tribunal n\u2019a aucun pouvoir sur l\u2019exercice par la Commission de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, de renvoyer une plainte pour enqu\u00eate.\nHalifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, au paragraphe 50. (Dossier de requ\u00eate de la Commission, onglet 7).\n17. Tout r\u00e9cemment, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 que le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 instruire les plaintes et qu\u2019il ne peut pas subsidiairement remettre en question le processus d\u00e9cisionnel de la Commission. Le raisonnement suivi par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Lemire est instructif. Dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, le juge a conclu ce qui suit :\n[55] La LCDP instaure deux institutions distinctes; chacune d\u2019elle se voit assigner un r\u00f4le particulier, lequel est d\u00e9crit dans la Loi. En outre, la Loi met en place un m\u00e9canisme complet de traitement des plaintes li\u00e9es aux droits de la personne. La Commission est au c\u0153ur de ce m\u00e9canisme; sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi, la Commission joue le r\u00f4le d\u2019organisme habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir, \u00e0 administrer et \u00e0 traiter les plaintes relatives \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. La Loi n\u2019octroie au Tribunal aucun mandat en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019application de ce m\u00e9canisme; elle indique uniquement, \u00e0 l\u2019article 50, que le Tribunal \u00ab instruit la plainte \u00bb lorsque la Commission formule une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cette fin. Ces facteurs donnent \u00e0 penser que le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019entendait pas que le Tribunal dispose du pouvoir de d\u00e9clarer la Loi inop\u00e9rante sur le fondement de la mani\u00e8re dont elle est administr\u00e9e.\n[56] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence en ce qui concerne l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission aux termes du paragraphe 44(3) (rejet ou renvoi d\u2019une plainte) et de l\u2019article 47 (nomination d\u2019un conciliateur) de la LCDP. Un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est la voie qu\u2019il convient de suivre pour contester une d\u00e9cision de la Commission touchant de telles questions.\n[57] Au moment d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, le Tribunal ne peut pas subsidiairement remettre en question une d\u00e9cision que la Commission a rendue conform\u00e9ment au pouvoir qui lui a conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la loi, cette contestation doit prendre la forme d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire :\n[58] La pr\u00e9occupation soulev\u00e9e quant au fait que la Commission ait renvoy\u00e9 la plainte en cause au Tribunal m\u00eame si la majeure partie des documents litigieux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s d\u2019Internet constitue, dans les faits, un commentaire sur la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de demander au Tribunal de tenir une enqu\u00eate. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le mandat de formuler de tels commentaires. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n(Lemire, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 55 \u00e0 58)\n[29] Finalement, la Commission a \u00e9galement renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2003 TCDP 32, au paragraphe 12, (Dossier de requ\u00eate de la Commission, onglet 6). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du membre instructeur Hadjis du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[30] En conclusion, la Commission mentionne ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n23. Essentiellement, nous pr\u00e9tendons respectueusement que rien dans la d\u00e9cision de la Commission ne donne \u00e0 penser que, comme le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019intim\u00e9e, seule la \u00ab question de l\u2019appareil t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate. L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque des \u00e9l\u00e9ments non pertinents, notamment des commentaires formul\u00e9s par les enqu\u00eateurs de la Commission qui ne lient pas le Tribunal. Les instances tenues devant le Tribunal sont des instances de novo. \u00c0 ce titre, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour enqu\u00eater sur la plainte de Mme Gover dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et non pas uniquement sur certaines parties de la plainte.\nIII. D\u00e9cision\n[31] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on exhaustive les arguments \u00e9crits des parties, de m\u00eame qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir consult\u00e9 la jurisprudence pertinente que les parties ont cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal arrive \u00e0 la conclusion qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[32] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le Tribunal estime que le point principal dont il y a lieu de tenir compte afin de trancher la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est la lettre du 3 mai 2012 adress\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, Mme Shirish P. Chotalia, \u00e0 laquelle il est certainement tr\u00e8s utile de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence.\n[traduction]\nMme Chotalia,\nJe vous \u00e9cris pour vous informer que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a examin\u00e9 la plainte (20041101) de Janet Glover contre l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers.\nLa Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte parce qu\u2019elle est convaincue que, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal est justifi\u00e9e. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nVous trouverez ci-jointe une copie du formulaire de plainte. Le formulaire no 1, qui comporte des informations sur la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sera transmis par la Division des services du contentieux.\nLa plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e seront inform\u00e9es qu\u2019ils recevront du Tribunal de plus amples renseignements sur cette instance.\nJe vous prie d\u2019accepter, Madame, l\u2019expression de mes sentiments distingu\u00e9s.\nDavid Langtry\n[33] La lecture du deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de cette lettre r\u00e9v\u00e8le que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu des dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de demander au Tribunal d\u2019instruire [traduction] \u00ab la plainte, parce qu\u2019elle est convaincue que, compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances, l\u2019instruction de la plainte est justifi\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[34] De plus, une copie du formulaire de plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 jointe \u00e0 la lettre.\n[35] Curieusement, aucune mention de cette lettre directement adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne ne figure dans les arguments formul\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire limiter la port\u00e9e de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[36] Les documents annex\u00e9s \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e comprennent bien une lettre dat\u00e9e \u00e9galement du 3 mai 2012, mais adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante et libell\u00e9e dans des termes quelque peu diff\u00e9rents de celle de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[37] Cette nuance apparait vitale quant \u00e0 la survie de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[38] En effet, il ressort que, sur le plan juridique, seule la lettre adress\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne conf\u00e8re au Tribunal tous les pouvoirs que la Loi pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) et \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n44. (3) Sur r\u00e9ception du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe (1), la Commission :\na) peut demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer, en application de l\u2019article 49, un membre pour instruire la plainte vis\u00e9e par le rapport, si elle est convaincue :\n(i) d\u2019une part, que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celle-ci est justifi\u00e9,\n(ii) d\u2019autre part, qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de renvoyer la plainte en application du paragraphe (2) ni de la rejeter aux termes des alin\u00e9as 41c) \u00e0 e);\n49 (1) La Commission peut, \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte, si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celle-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e.\n(2) Sur r\u00e9ception de la demande, le pr\u00e9sident d\u00e9signe un membre pour instruire la plainte. Il peut, s\u2019il estime que la difficult\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire le justifie, d\u00e9signer trois membres, auxquels d\u00e8s lors les articles 50 \u00e0 58 s\u2019appliquent.\n(3) Le pr\u00e9sident assume lui-m\u00eame la pr\u00e9sidence de la formation coll\u00e9giale ou, lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019en fait pas partie, la d\u00e9l\u00e8gue \u00e0 l\u2019un des membres instructeurs.\n(4) Le pr\u00e9sident met \u00e0 la disposition des parties un exemplaire des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n(5) Dans le cas o\u00f9 la plainte met en cause la compatibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition d\u2019une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou de ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application avec la pr\u00e9sente loi ou ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application, le membre instructeur ou celui qui pr\u00e9side l\u2019instruction, lorsqu\u2019elle est coll\u00e9giale, doit \u00eatre membre du barreau d\u2019une province ou de la Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec.\n(6) Le fait qu\u2019une partie \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate soul\u00e8ve la question de la compatibilit\u00e9 vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (5) en cours d\u2019instruction n\u2019a pas pour effet de dessaisir le ou les membres d\u00e9sign\u00e9s pour entendre l\u2019affaire et qui ne seraient pas autrement qualifi\u00e9s pour l\u2019entendre.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[39] En effet, aucun document, autre que la lettre adress\u00e9e directement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal et \u00e0 aucune autre personne, n\u2019est utile ou n\u00e9cessaire pour attribuer au Tribunal le pouvoir de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate qui lui est confi\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[40] Le Tribunal s\u2019appuie notamment sur une r\u00e9cente d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par Mme Sophie Marchildon, juge administrative au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, dans Premakumar Kanagasabapathy c. Air Canada, 2013 TCDP 7.\n[41] Dans cette d\u00e9cision la juge administrative Marchildon a eu \u00e0 d\u00e9battre des m\u00eames questions que celles du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[42] Concernant la question de la nature d\u00e9terminante de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente, Mme Marchildon mentionne ce qui suit au paragraphe 29 de sa d\u00e9cision :\n[29] \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 49(1), la \u00ab meilleure preuve \u00bb de la demande d\u2019instruction qu\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente est ceci : la lettre que la Commission a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente pour lui demander d\u2019instruire la plainte. Dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, la lettre de demande d\u2019instruction est sign\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim, mais, chose plus importante encore, elle est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal. Il s\u2019agit du document qui met en branle tout le processus d\u2019instruction du Tribunal. Il s\u2019agit donc du document qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir si la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 ou non.\n[43] Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9e, la juge administrative Marchildon fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9cisions, dont C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2003 TCDP 32 et Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22, qui traitent \u00e9galement de questions similaires \u00e0 celles du pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[44] Dans Kowalski, le membre instructeur Hadjis s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 comme suit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019instruire des plaintes en vertu de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi :\n[7] Le Tribunal tire sa comp\u00e9tence pour instruire des plaintes de l'article 49 de la Loi, en vertu duquel le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal doit instruire une plainte sur r\u00e9ception de la demande de la Commission (paragraphe 49(2)). La port\u00e9e des instructions du Tribunal est ainsi limit\u00e9e aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes qui accompagnent une telle demande.\n[8] La Commission a-t-elle renvoy\u00e9 toute la plainte de M. Kowalski au Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce? La Commission n'a pas mentionn\u00e9, dans sa lettre au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de limiter la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Cela donne donc \u00e0 penser que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal la plainte compl\u00e8te, comme M. Kowalski l'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 20 avril 2007.\n[45] Dans la d\u00e9cision Kowalski, le membre instructeur Hadjis fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019affaire C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. Procureur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2003, TCDP 32, dans laquelle le libell\u00e9 de la lettre de la Commission au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal ne permettait aucunement de supposer que seulement certaines parties de la plainte \u00e9taient renvoy\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, le membre instructeur Hadjis a conclu que le Tribunal \u00e9tait saisi de la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\n[46] Il est utile de mentionner que, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Kowalski, dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, tout comme dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9, rien n\u2019indique que la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas traiter certaines all\u00e9gations figurant dans la plainte dont elle \u00e9tait saisie.\n[47] De plus, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019argument voulant que le Tribunal doive tenir compte des motifs invoqu\u00e9s par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa d\u00e9cision, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est inutile que le Tribunal traite des facteurs \u00e9tayant les rapports d\u2019enqu\u00eate qui figurent dans le dossier de la plaignante, car, si le Tribunal faisait cela, il se trouverait \u00e0 r\u00e9viser les motifs de la Commission, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de faire selon la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Warman c. Lemire, [2012] A.C.F. 1233, aux paragraphes 56 \u00e0 58.\n[48] Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de la lettre dat\u00e9e du 3 mai 2012 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal de l\u2019\u00e9poque, Mme Shirish P. Chotalia, laquelle ne fait aucune distinction en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre partie de la plainte et ne fait aucune mention d\u2019un rejet d\u2019une quelconque partie de la plainte, j\u2019en viens donc \u00e0 la conclusion que la plainte, y compris la question du traitement\/salaire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 au Tribunal aux fins d\u2019enqu\u00eate et audition.\n[49] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 24 mai 2013",

La plainte [1] Le 7 octobre 2010, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte de Todd Chaudhary (le plaignant) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Smoother Movers (l\u2019intim\u00e9e).\n[2] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019emploi qu\u2019il a exerc\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement, au sens des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi, du fait de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique, de sa couleur et de son sexe.\n[3] Le Tribunal a instruit la pr\u00e9sente affaire du 10 au 12 juillet 2012, \u00e0 Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique).\nII. Le contexte [4] Le plaignant a initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s du British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal (le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique, ou le Tribunal de la C.\u2011B.) le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2008.\n[5] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal de la C.-B., tenue le 10 mars 2009, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait valoir que le tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur la plainte. Dans un affidavit, Doug Bensley, faisant affaires sous la raison sociale de Smoother Movers, a affirm\u00e9 sous serment : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] que son entreprise, de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et continue, dans le pass\u00e9 et actuellement, m\u00e8ne environ 30 % de ses activit\u00e9s \u2013 ramassages et livraisons \u2013 dans d\u2019autres provinces du Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis \u00bb (Chaudhary c. Smoother Movers, 2009 BCHRT 111, au paragraphe 2 [Chaudhary]).\n[6] Le Tribunal de la C.-B. a reconnu que Smoother Movers m\u00e8ne de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re et continue des activit\u00e9s de transport extraprovinciales, qui rel\u00e8vent de la comp\u00e9tence f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et il a conclu que la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de son ressort (voir Chaudhary, aux paragraphes 8 et 9).\n[7] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la suite la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne le 23 juin 2009.\nIII. Les requ\u00eates en rejet [8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux requ\u00eates en vue de faire rejeter la plainte. Le premier avis de requ\u00eate, dat\u00e9 du 22 mars 2012, est fond\u00e9 sur le temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant d\u2019obtenir une audience. Le second avis de requ\u00eate, dat\u00e9 du 24 avril 2013, est fond\u00e9 sur le temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant de parvenir \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision.\n[9] Le Tribunal est tenu de veiller \u00e0 ce que les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant lui aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019instruction, de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de formuler des observations (voir le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, un retard peut compromettre les chances qu\u2019a une partie de pr\u00e9senter sa position :\nLorsqu\u2019un d\u00e9lai compromet la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019une partie de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la plainte port\u00e9e contre elle, notamment parce que ses souvenirs se sont estomp\u00e9s, parce que des t\u00e9moins essentiels sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s ou ne sont pas disponibles ou parce que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 perdus, le d\u00e9lai dans les proc\u00e9dures administratives peut \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9 pour contester la validit\u00e9 de ces proc\u00e9dures et pour justifier r\u00e9paration [\u2026]. Il est donc reconnu que les principes de justice naturelle et l\u2019obligation d\u2019agir \u00e9quitablement comprennent le droit \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable et qu\u2019il est possible de rem\u00e9dier au d\u00e9lai injustifi\u00e9 dans des proc\u00e9dures administratives qui compromettent l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience [\u2026].\n(Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44, au paragraphe 102 [Blencoe])\n[10] Cependant, \u00ab le d\u00e9lai ne justifie pas, \u00e0 lui seul, un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures [en tant qu\u2019] abus de proc\u00e9dure en common law \u00bb (Blencoe, au paragraphe 101). Selon les juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame, \u00ab il faut prouver qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai inacceptable a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice important \u00bb (Blencoe, au paragraphe 101; voir aussi Grover c. Conseil national de recherche du Canada, 2009 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 40 \u00e0 43, et Grover c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2010 CF 320, aux paragraphes 29 et 30).\nA. La requ\u00eate du 22 mars 2012 [11] La premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate en rejet a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue dans le cadre de l\u2019audience tenue du 10 au 12 juillet 2012.\n[12] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est fond\u00e9e sur le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre les dates auxquelles ont eu lieu les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents qui sont \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte et la date de la tenue de l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal, soit plus de quatre ans. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce retard est d\u00e9raisonnable et lui a caus\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice pour ce qui est d\u2019opposer une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re \u00e0 la plainte. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle soutient que des t\u00e9moins ne sont plus disponibles ou ne se souviennent plus clairement des faits et des questions de preuve qui se rapportent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a nomm\u00e9 deux t\u00e9moins qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en mesure d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le t\u00e9moignage de ces deux personnes aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 important pour sa d\u00e9fense. Le premier t\u00e9moin potentiel, Jason Pilay, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a qualifi\u00e9 de personne sans domicile fixe, qui a travaill\u00e9 pour elle pendant la p\u00e9riode de trois jours qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte et que le plaignant a nomm\u00e9e dans sa plainte, \u00e9tait introuvable. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il est d\u00e9raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 pouvoir trouver apr\u00e8s quatre ans et demi une personne qui vit dans un refuge pour sans-abri. Le second t\u00e9moin potentiel, Jim Postlethwaite, lui aussi nomm\u00e9 par le plaignant dans l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions relatif \u00e0 la plainte, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, mais n\u2019a pu assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience, car, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il \u00e9tait incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. Postlethwaite \u00e9tait disponible au cours des quatre derni\u00e8res pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et, si l\u2019affaire s\u2019\u00e9tait d\u00e9roul\u00e9e en temps opportun, elle aurait pu b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[14] Malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle soit au courant des all\u00e9gations du plaignant depuis 2008 et du fait que M. Pilay est sans domicile fixe, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a dit ne pas avoir tent\u00e9 de trouver M. Pilay avant que la Commission commence \u00e0 faire enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, ce qui, au plus t\u00f4t, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un certain temps apr\u00e8s le 23 juin 2009, date \u00e0 laquelle M. Chaudhary a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience du Tribunal de la C.-B. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la derni\u00e8re fois qu\u2019elle avait tent\u00e9 de trouver M. Pilay, c\u2019\u00e9tait au moins deux ans avant la date de l\u2019audience. Une fois qu\u2019une date d\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e, rien n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour retrouver M. Pilay. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9voyait que M. Postlethwaite serait mis en libert\u00e9 avant la date de l\u2019audience et qu\u2019elle esp\u00e9rait que ce dernier soit donc en mesure d\u2019y assister. Cependant, une fois que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pris connaissance de la situation de M. Postlethwaite et, par la suite, du fait que celui-ci ne serait pas en mesure d\u2019assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ajourner l\u2019instance ni cherch\u00e9 d\u2019autres moyens d\u2019obtenir son t\u00e9moignage. J\u2019en conclus que m\u00eame si l\u2019indisponibilit\u00e9 de ces deux t\u00e9moins peut avoir port\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cette situation est imputable \u00e0 la propre inaction de cette derni\u00e8re, et non \u00e0 un retard en soi.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a quand m\u00eame fait compara\u00eetre trois t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience : Doug Bensley, Brad Burke et Kevin Carson. Elle soutient toutefois qu\u2019en raison du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 ces personnes ne se souviennent plus clairement des faits et des questions de preuve qui se rapportent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Il m\u2019a sembl\u00e9 que ces t\u00e9moins, apr\u00e8s les avoir entendus, avaient une bonne connaissance et un bon souvenir des faits qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 capables de t\u00e9moigner seuls, sans notes ou autres aides, et se sont souvenus d\u2019une bonne part des d\u00e9tails entourant les faits en question. Je n\u2019admets donc pas non plus qu\u2019\u00e0 cause du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, les souvenirs des t\u00e9moins sur l\u2019une quelconque des questions cl\u00e9s soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte se sont estomp\u00e9s ou que, de ce fait, cela a caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e un pr\u00e9judice important.\n[16] En cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate du 22 mars 2012 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e.\nB. La requ\u00eate du 24 avril 2013 [17] Le fondement de la seconde requ\u00eate en rejet est la Note de pratique no 1 du Tribunal, qui porte sur la tenue des audiences et la diffusion des d\u00e9cisions en temps opportun; ce document, dat\u00e9 du 22 octobre 2007 (voir, en ligne : http:\/\/chrt-tcdp.gc.ca\/NS\/about-apropos\/download\/pn-np-fra.asp) indique, notamment, ce qui suit :\nDe plus, le Tribunal est fermement r\u00e9solu \u00e0 respecter la directive du Parlement dans le paragraphe 48.9(1) et \u00e0 parvenir \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision dans un d\u00e9lai de quatre mois, aussi souvent que possible, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son engagement envers les parlementaires et l\u2019ensemble de la population canadienne.\n[18] Aux dires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, plus de neuf mois se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis la tenue de l\u2019audience et il n\u2019y a eu aucune explication ou excuse pour le temps mis \u00e0 parvenir \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 son avis, ce d\u00e9lai est inacceptable, car Smoother Movers se trouve sous l\u2019\u0153il du public, accus\u00e9e de violations des droits de la personne, depuis plus de cinq ans. Elle demande donc que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e.\n[19] Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le Tribunal n\u2019a pu respecter le d\u00e9lai prescrit de quatre mois avant de parvenir \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision, mais, hormis le retard proprement dit, rien ne prouve que ce fait a port\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e en entachant sa r\u00e9putation. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus t\u00f4t, \u00ab le d\u00e9lai ne justifie pas, \u00e0 lui seul, un arr\u00eat des proc\u00e9dures [en tant qu\u2019] abus de proc\u00e9dure en common law \u00bb (Blencoe, aux paragraphes 115 \u00e0 121 et 133).\n[20] En cons\u00e9quence, la requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 24 avril 2013 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est rejet\u00e9e elle aussi.\nIV. Le fond de la plainte A. La preuve du plaignant [21] \u00c0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, le plaignant a donn\u00e9 sa version des faits qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la plainte. Il se d\u00e9crit comme un homme au teint brun, d\u2019ascendance moyen\u2011orientale.\n[22] En d\u00e9cembre 2007, le plaignant a postul\u00e9 un poste aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Selon lui, le poste en question \u00e9tait annonc\u00e9 dans le site Web d\u2019Emploi Canada et il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un poste permanent et \u00e0 temps plein de chauffeur de camion de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement. Il soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9, \u00e0 ces conditions-l\u00e0, par Doug Bensley, faisant affaires sous le nom de Smoother Movers.\n[23] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e durant trois jours, du 17 au 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, p\u00e9riode durant laquelle il a pris part au d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement d\u2019un bureau. On l\u2019avait charg\u00e9, notamment, d\u2019empaqueter des objets et de les d\u00e9placer depuis le bureau jusque dans un ascenseur, de les faire descendre jusqu\u2019au camion de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, de d\u00e9charger ensuite les objets au nouvel emplacement du bureau, et, aussi, d\u2019assembler \u00e0 cet endroit des \u00e9tag\u00e8res et des postes de travail modulaires.\n[24] Le plaignant soutient que, d\u00e8s le premier jour de travail, des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont tenu des propos discriminatoires au sujet de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique et de sa couleur. Selon lui, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2007, il se trouvait dans l\u2019ascenseur, en train de faire descendre un chargement en compagnie d\u2019un autre employ\u00e9, Jim Postlethwaite. Le plaignant a relat\u00e9 l\u2019incident, au cours duquel il soutient qu\u2019il aurait dit \u00e0 M. Postlethwaite : [traduction] \u00ab aux \u00c9tats-Unis, ils ont supprim\u00e9 le Hate Crimes Act [Loi sur les crimes haineux] \u00bb. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, en r\u00e9ponse, M. Postlethwaite a fait un commentaire au sujet du fait qu\u2019il voulait d\u00e9m\u00e9nager aux \u00c9tats-Unis pour y cr\u00e9er un clan du KKK.\n[25] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que, le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2007 encore, un autre employ\u00e9, Jason Pilay, n\u2019a pas cess\u00e9 de le traiter d\u2019Indien dans l\u2019aire o\u00f9 se trouvait la plateforme de chargement, \u00e0 l\u2019ancien emplacement du bureau. Il soutient avoir dit \u00e0 M. Pilay : [traduction] \u00ab h\u00e9, dis donc, ce n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s gentil \u00e7a, mon fr\u00e8re [\u2026] \u00bb, mais, malheureusement, les remarques n\u2019ont pas cess\u00e9.\n[26] Le plaignant soutient que, le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2007, un troisi\u00e8me employ\u00e9, Brad Burke, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 le traiter de [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e8gre \u00bb. Il aurait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cet homme de d\u00e9finir ce mot et il lui aurait expliqu\u00e9 que ce mot ne correspondait pas \u00e0 sa d\u00e9finition. Le plaignant ajoute que, par la suite, ce mot a \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9 souvent pendant toute la journ\u00e9e par les autres employ\u00e9s et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, que M. Pilay a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 raconter des blagues en employant ce mot.\n[27] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2007 encore, un quatri\u00e8me employ\u00e9, Kevin Carson, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui demander, en imitant l\u2019accent indien : [traduction] \u00ab Du curry, tu en manges? \u00bb M. Carson aurait continu\u00e9 de lui poser la question \u00e0 plusieurs reprises pendant que les deux faisaient monter un chargement dans l\u2019ascenseur.\n[28] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2007 encore, pendant qu\u2019ils faisaient descendre un chargement dans un ascenseur, qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s charg\u00e9, M. Burke a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se frotter les fesses contre lui. Ce geste l\u2019a fort contrari\u00e9 et il l\u2019a fait savoir \u00e0 M. Burke en sortant de l\u2019ascenseur.\n[29] Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, on a demand\u00e9 au plaignant d\u2019assembler une \u00e9tag\u00e8re. Selon lui, il fallait deux personnes pour ex\u00e9cuter cette t\u00e2che, mais les autres employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient tous peu dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019aider et l\u2019avaient laiss\u00e9 finir le travail tout seul. Pendant qu\u2019il s\u2019affairait \u00e0 assembler l\u2019\u00e9tag\u00e8re, Doug Bensley serait entr\u00e9 dans la pi\u00e8ce et aurait dit : [traduction] \u00ab Tu es incomp\u00e9tent. Es-tu en train de prendre ta retraite ici? \u00bb Le plaignant a estim\u00e9 que cela voulait dire qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas capable de bien faire le travail et qu\u2019il prenait trop de temps \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter.\n[30] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019alors qu\u2019il avait presque termin\u00e9 l\u2019assemblage de l\u2019\u00e9tag\u00e8re, M. Carson est entr\u00e9 dans la pi\u00e8ce; il lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi cela prenait tant de temps et il s\u2019est pench\u00e9 comme s\u2019il allait lui donner un coup de main. Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend toutefois que le pantalon de M. Carson \u00e9tait si bas qu\u2019il lui a exhib\u00e9 son fessier et qu\u2019il est parti, sans l\u2019aider. Dans un autre incident survenu le m\u00eame jour, pendant qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait du montage d\u2019une armoire, le pantalon de M. Burke \u00e9tait si bas que lui aussi lui a exhib\u00e9 son fessier.\n[31] En outre, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, le plaignant et quelques-uns des autres employ\u00e9s s\u2019occupaient de mettre en place des postes de travail modulaires. Il a dit aux autres employ\u00e9s que les postes de travail n\u2019\u00e9taient pas espac\u00e9s comme il faut. Il pr\u00e9tend que, en r\u00e9ponse, MM. Burke, Carson et Pilay lui ont dit : [traduction] \u00ab tais-toi, reste o\u00f9 tu es et tiens la cloison du poste de travail \u00bb. Quand M. Postlethwaite, le chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, est arriv\u00e9, le plaignant a tent\u00e9 de lui expliquer que les postes de travail n\u2019\u00e9taient pas espac\u00e9s comme il faut, et M. Postlethwaite a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 lui crier apr\u00e8s et lui a dit [traduction] \u00ab Rentre chez toi \u00bb. Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu : [traduction] \u00ab Non, on continue le travail et on le finit. \u00bb Il a ajout\u00e9 que M. Postlethwaite \u00e9tait venu le voir par la suite et avait dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e9nerv\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il avait eu un accident avec le camion de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et s\u2019\u00e9tait ensuite disput\u00e9 avec le chauffeur d\u2019une d\u00e9panneuse.\n[32] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, apr\u00e8s son quart de travail, il n\u2019a plus re\u00e7u d\u2019heures de travail de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il aurait t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bensley peu apr\u00e8s le 19 d\u00e9cembre pour demander plus d\u2019heures de travail et s\u2019informer du moment o\u00f9 il serait pay\u00e9. M. Bensley lui aurait parl\u00e9 sur un ton brusque et lui aurait raccroch\u00e9 au nez. Le plaignant a fini par \u00eatre pay\u00e9 pour ses trois quarts de travail, mais il n\u2019est pas retourn\u00e9 travailler pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il ajoute qu\u2019en d\u00e9pit du fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 comme chauffeur de camion de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement, jamais on ne lui donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de conduire le camion.\nB. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie? [33] Dans une affaire soumise au Tribunal, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie \u00ab [\u2026] est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur [du plaignant], en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de [l\u2019] intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28).\n[34] Compte tenu des commentaires racistes que les employ\u00e9s ont formul\u00e9s \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, du fait que Doug Bensley l\u2019a qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019incomp\u00e9tent et du fait que les employ\u00e9s lui ont exhib\u00e9 leur fessier, le plaignant est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment tourment\u00e9 et mis \u00e0 part dans son milieu de travail. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019article 7 et de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi.\n(i) Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi [35] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Dans les plaintes relevant de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a), le plaignant est tenu d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre un motif de distinction illicite et la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur de refuser de l\u2019employer ou de continuer de l\u2019employer (voir Roopnarine c. Banque de Montr\u00e9al, 2010 TCDP 5, au paragraphe 49). Cela dit, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la distinction soit le seul motif de la d\u00e9cision; il suffit qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un seul des facteurs dans la d\u00e9cision (voir Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [1990] A.C.F. no 419 (C.A.F.) (QL), et Khiamal c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495, au paragraphe 61).\n[36] Au vu de la preuve que le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, il est difficile de saisir pourquoi l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne lui a pas offert plus d\u2019heures de travail apr\u00e8s son quart de travail du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007; aucune des deux parties n\u2019est par la suite entr\u00e9e en contact avec l\u2019autre au sujet d\u2019un travail additionnel ou d\u2019un manque de travail. On pourrait dire qu\u2019il ressort de la preuve du plaignant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a peut-\u00eatre eu des doutes au sujet de sa comp\u00e9tence. En fin de compte, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre un refus de continuer de l\u2019employer, s\u2019il y en avait un, et un motif illicite de distinction.\n[37] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pu porter \u00e0 l\u2019attention de M. Bensley la conduite discriminatoire reproch\u00e9e qui avait eu lieu entre le 17 et le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007. Selon lui, M. Bensley \u00e9tait un homme intimidant et d\u2019un abord difficile, et il avait h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9voquer la question, de crainte que cela se r\u00e9percute sur son emploi. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, M. Bensley, le propri\u00e9taire et exploitant de Smoother Movers, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent quand les \u00e9v\u00e9nements cens\u00e9ment discriminatoires se sont produits, et on n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve d\u00e9notant que M. Bensley \u00e9tait au courant des actes discriminatoires qu\u2019auraient commis ses autres employ\u00e9s avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal de la C.-B. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas non plus fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une conduite discriminatoire quelconque de la part de M. Bensley. Le fait que ce dernier ait pu l\u2019avoir trait\u00e9 d\u2019incomp\u00e9tent n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 un motif illicite de distinction.\n[38] En cons\u00e9quence, je conclus que le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi.\n(ii) Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi [39] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. \u00ab D\u00e9favoriser \u00bb consiste \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une distinction ou \u00e0 traiter quelqu\u2019un de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente (voir Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2009 CF 1009, au paragraphe 44 [Tahmourpour]; d\u00e9cision modifi\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs dans Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2010 CAF 192 [Tahmourpour (CAF)], et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, au paragraphe 254, d\u00e9cision confirm\u00e9e par 2013 CAF 75 [SSEFPNC]). Cependant, ce ne sont pas tous les cas de distinction qui sont discriminatoires, car la Loi nuance la diff\u00e9rence de traitement en employant le mot \u00ab d\u00e9favorablement \u00bb. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le mot \u00ab d\u00e9favorable \u00bb est un adjectif dont le sens ordinaire est pr\u00e9judiciable, dommageable ou mauvais (voir Tahmourpour, au paragraphe 44; voir aussi Tahmourpour (CAF), au paragraphe 12). Enfin, la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur un motif illicite de distinction et ne requiert pas que le plaignant pr\u00e9sente une preuve de la mani\u00e8re dont un groupe de comparaison est trait\u00e9 (SSEFPNC, CAF, aux paragraphes 16 \u00e0 18).\n[40] Il n\u2019y avait pas assez d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve d\u00e9notant que le commentaire que M. Postlethwaite aurait fait \u00e0 propos de la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un clan du KKK visait le plaignant parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un homme de couleur, ou que cela l\u2019aurait touch\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9favorable. Le plaignant a toutefois d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait trouv\u00e9 offensants les autres commentaires et blagues racistes que les autres employ\u00e9s auraient faits \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Il soutient qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son quart de travail, le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2007, il avait souffert d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, ce qui l\u2019avait emp\u00each\u00e9 de bien dormir cette nuit-l\u00e0 et l\u2019avait amen\u00e9 \u00e0 arriver en retard au travail le lendemain.\n[41] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019incident mettant en cause le fessier de M. Burke dans l\u2019ascenseur, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait dit \u00e0 ce dernier d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab aller se faire foutre \u00bb. \u00c0 la suite des deux autres pr\u00e9tendus incidents d\u2019exhibition de fessier, dus au fait que MM. Carson et Burke portaient leur pantalon trop bas, le plaignant a dit qu\u2019il ignorait quelles \u00e9taient leurs intentions, mais il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 ce geste.\n[42] Dans l\u2019ensemble, le plaignant s\u2019est senti traumatis\u00e9 par ses trois jours de travail aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il a le sentiment que les autres employ\u00e9s de Smoother Movers le tourmentaient parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un nouvel employ\u00e9. La pr\u00e9tendue conduite discriminatoire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a toujours d\u00e9concert\u00e9 et, dit-il, cela a chambard\u00e9 sa vie au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[43] Il est possible que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les incidents d\u2019exhibition de fessier, mais je ne vois pas de lien entre la conduite reproch\u00e9e et le sexe du plaignant. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce dernier : [traduction] \u00ab il ignorait quelles \u00e9taient leurs intentions \u00bb, mis \u00e0 part peut-\u00eatre de le tourmenter parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un nouvel employ\u00e9. La conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9e, mais elle ne donne pas lieu \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable prima facie, du fait du sexe, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[44] Cependant, \u00e0 part le commentaire de M. Postlethwaite, j\u2019admets que les autres commentaires et blagues de nature raciste qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits ont \u00e9tabli une distinction entre le plaignant et le reste de ses coll\u00e8gues du fait de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique et de sa couleur. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, ces pr\u00e9tendus commentaires et blagues ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 blessants pour le plaignant.\n[45] En cons\u00e9quence, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, du fait de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur.\n(iii) Les all\u00e9gations du plaignant au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi [46] Aux termes de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi, le harc\u00e8lement s\u2019entend d\u2019une conduite importune, dirig\u00e9e contre une autre personne du fait d\u2019un motif illicite de distinction, et le harc\u00e8lement requiert en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition; cependant, plus la conduite et ses cons\u00e9quences sont graves, moins la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire. La gravit\u00e9 de la conduite reproch\u00e9e est \u00e9valu\u00e9e sous l\u2019angle de la personne raisonnable se trouvant dans la m\u00eame situation (voir Janzen c. Platy enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 RCS 1252, et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), [1999] 3 CF 653 [Franke]). Enfin, dans les cas o\u00f9 la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre un employeur a trait \u00e0 la conduite de ses employ\u00e9s, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que, dans toute la mesure du possible, la personne victime du harc\u00e8lement avise cet employeur de la pr\u00e9tendue conduite offensante (voir Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 246).\n[47] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lors de ses deux premiers jours de travail, soit les 17 et 18 d\u00e9cembre 2007, il lui a fallu endurer de fa\u00e7on persistante les commentaires et les blagues que MM. Pilay, Burke et Carson auraient faits au sujet de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique et de sa couleur. Ces commentaires \u00e9taient d\u00e9plac\u00e9s, comme l\u2019illustre, d\u2019une part, le fait que le plaignant ait r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Burke au sujet de sa d\u00e9finition du mot [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e8gre \u00bb et, d\u2019autre part, son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel il avait dit \u00e0 M. Pilay qu\u2019il n\u2019appr\u00e9ciait pas ses commentaires. Je suis donc d\u2019avis que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de harc\u00e8lement, au regard de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi, du fait de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la couleur.\n[48] Se fondant sur les incidents d\u2019exhibition de fessier, le plaignant soutient \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Aux termes du paragraphe 14(2) de la Loi, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Ce type de harc\u00e8lement exige que la conduite soit de nature sexuelle, ce qui englobe un large \u00e9ventail de comportements, et il est d\u00e9termin\u00e9 au cas par cas, en fonction du crit\u00e8re de la personne raisonnable se trouvant dans la m\u00eame situation (voir Franke).\n[49] Je n\u2019admets pas que le plaignant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9 sexuellement. Le frottage de fessier ne s\u2019est pas poursuivi apr\u00e8s l\u2019unique incident survenu dans l\u2019ascenseur, apr\u00e8s que le plaignant se fut f\u00e2ch\u00e9 contre M. Burke. En consid\u00e9rant la situation sous l\u2019angle de la personne raisonnable et au vu de la preuve, je ne crois pas que la conduite \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle. Je ne crois pas non plus que la gravit\u00e9 de ce seul incident serait assimilable \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement.\n[50] Les deux autres incidents, dans lesquels MM. Carson et Burke ont cens\u00e9ment exhib\u00e9 leur fessier au plaignant, ne correspondent pas eux non plus au crit\u00e8re relatif au harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sens de la Loi. Le plaignant, par ses paroles ou ses gestes, n\u2019a pas non plus fait savoir aux deux hommes que leur conduite \u00e9tait d\u00e9plac\u00e9e; de plus, \u00e0 part ces deux incidents, la conduite n\u2019a pas persist\u00e9. La question de savoir si la conduite \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle est \u00e9galement douteuse. Le plaignant n\u2019a certainement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve d\u00e9notant que les actes reproch\u00e9s \u00e9taient de nature sexuelle. En cons\u00e9quence, \u00e0 mon avis, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima face de harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sens de la Loi.\n[51] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je suis d\u2019avis que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie au regard de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) et de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi pour les motifs illicites de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et de la couleur. Examinons maintenant la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la discrimination prima facie.\nC. La preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [52] Une fois qu\u2019un plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est tenu de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination prima facie en question n\u2019a pas eu lieu de la mani\u00e8re all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ou que l\u2019acte est justifiable selon la Loi (voir les paragraphes 15 \u00e0 24 de la Loi).\n[53] \u00c0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Doug Bensley, Brad Burke et Kevin Carson ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour le compte de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Ils soutiennent que la discrimination prima facie all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu lieu.\n[54] M. Bensley n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin d\u2019aucun des actes de discrimination prima facie et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le plaignant ne l\u2019avait jamais avis\u00e9 de tels incidents, que ce soit durant ses trois jours de travail ou par la suite.\n[55] M. Burke a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin d\u2019actes de harc\u00e8lement de nature raciste, ni y avoir particip\u00e9, pendant qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de Smoother Movers. Il nie avoir trait\u00e9 le plaignant de [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e8gre \u00bb ou avoir eu une conversation avec lui au sujet de la d\u00e9finition de ce mot. Il nie \u00e9galement avoir entendu d\u2019autres membres du personnel tenir ce genre de langage ou faire des commentaires ou des blagues au sujet de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la couleur du plaignant.\n[56] M. Carson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin d\u2019actes de harc\u00e8lement racistes, ni d\u2019y avoir particip\u00e9, pendant qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 au service de Smoother Movers. Il nie avoir trait\u00e9 le plaignant de [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e8gre \u00bb ou s\u2019\u00eatre moqu\u00e9 de lui en prenant l\u2019accent indien. Il nie \u00e9galement avoir entendu d\u2019autres membres du personnel tenir ce genre de langage ou faire des commentaires ou blagues au sujet de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de la couleur du plaignant.\nD. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle \u00e9tabli que la discrimination prima facie reproch\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu lieu? [57] Le plaignant soutient que le t\u00e9moignage de MM. Burke et Carson n\u2019\u00e9tait pas digne de foi. Il affirme que ce t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avance avec M. Bensley. Il fait aussi remarquer que M. Burke est encore au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et qu\u2019il a donc int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger son employeur et son propre emploi. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le plaignant soutient que MM. Burke et Carson entretiennent avec M. Bensley une amiti\u00e9 personnelle qui d\u00e9borde le cadre de leurs rapports professionnels.\n[58] Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu tous les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je n\u2019ai pas de raison de mettre en doute leur cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et il m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible de relever une incoh\u00e9rence quelconque dans leur t\u00e9moignage. Tous ont ni\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement les all\u00e9gations du plaignant, mais cela ne veut pas forc\u00e9ment dire qu\u2019on leur a fait r\u00e9p\u00e9ter leur t\u00e9moignage. MM. Bensley, Burke et Carson ont \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 entretenir une relation quelconque qui d\u00e9borde le cadre de leurs rapports professionnels. Dans l\u2019ensemble, je n\u2019ai aucune raison de croire que les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont induit le Tribunal en erreur.\n[59] En revanche, j\u2019ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 concilier les all\u00e9gations du plaignant avec le fait que celui-ci n\u2019a jamais fait \u00e9tat de l\u2019une d\u2019elles \u00e0 son employeur. Il soutient que M. Bensley est intimidant et d\u2019un abord difficile, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9voquer ses probl\u00e8mes, de crainte que cela se r\u00e9percute sur son emploi. Malgr\u00e9 cette affirmation, le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de confronter ses pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s harceleurs au sujet de leur conduite, critiquant M. Burque d\u2019avoir employ\u00e9 le mot [traduction] \u00ab n\u00e8gre \u00bb et demandant \u00e0 M. Carson de cesser de le traiter d\u2019Indien.\n[60] Le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de s\u2019exprimer dans son lieu de travail au sujet des probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019il avait per\u00e7us \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du travail d\u2019assemblage des postes de travail modulaires, le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2007. M\u00eame si Brad, Kevin et Jason lui avaient cens\u00e9ment dit [traduction] \u00ab tais\u2011toi \u00bb, le plaignant a \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9 par la suite la question aupr\u00e8s de Jim.\n[61] Le plaignant a dit aussi \u00eatre un habile n\u00e9gociateur et, \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il a pu n\u00e9gocier son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration avec M. Bensley. Ce dernier soutient qu\u2019apr\u00e8s les trois quarts de travail qu\u2019il avait accomplis pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant avait fait des difficult\u00e9s quand il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 question de son taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, et qu\u2019il lui avait express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 combien il gagnerait. Il y a eu une discussion au sujet de la question de savoir si le plaignant devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 en tant que journalier ou en tant que chauffeur, ce dernier poste \u00e9tant pay\u00e9 \u00e0 un taux sup\u00e9rieur. M. Bensley voulait le payer en tant que journalier. Le plaignant a soutenu que l\u2019annonce d\u2019emploi avait trait \u00e0 un chauffeur de camion de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement et qu\u2019il fallait donc le r\u00e9mun\u00e9rer en fonction de l\u2019annonce \u00e0 laquelle il avait r\u00e9pondu. M. Bensley soutient que, plut\u00f4t de discuter avec le plaignant, il avait acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate et lui avait donn\u00e9 plus que ce qu\u2019il payait habituellement \u00e0 un journalier.\n[62] Enfin, dans ses observations finales, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9but de 2008, il \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 en contact avec M. Bensley au sujet du comportement de M. Burke, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse de sa part (Transcription de l\u2019audience, \u00e0 la page 489). Cette d\u00e9claration ne concorde pas avec son t\u00e9moignage. En fait, plus tard dans ses observations finales, le plaignant a ajout\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nSi j\u2019avais pu travailler plus longtemps pour M. Bensley, j\u2019aurais port\u00e9 cette information \u00e0 son attention; cependant, M. Bensley ne m\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de le rencontrer de nouveau ou de travailler de nouveau avec lui. J\u2019\u00e9tais r\u00e9solu \u00e0 lui en parler; mais, comme je l\u2019ai dit, je n\u2019ai jamais eu par la suite la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler ou de m\u2019entretenir avec lui, et c\u2019est pour cela que nous sommes ici aujourd\u2019hui.\n(Transcription de l\u2018audience, aux pages 490 et 491).\n[63] M\u00eame s\u2019il a soutenu que l\u2019id\u00e9e de parler \u00e0 M. Bensley des probl\u00e8mes qu\u2019il avait au travail l\u2019intimidait, dans d\u2019autres situations semblables le plaignant n\u2019a pas eu de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer. L\u2019incoh\u00e9rence relev\u00e9e dans ses observations, au paragraphe 62 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, suscite \u00e9galement un certain doute quant \u00e0 la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[64] J\u2019ai aussi de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 concilier le fait que, malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 offens\u00e9 et bless\u00e9 par les pr\u00e9tendus commentaires et blagues de nature raciste que les autres employ\u00e9s auraient faits, ainsi que les tourments qu\u2019ils lui auraient fait subir, le plaignant a continu\u00e9 d\u2019interagir avec eux au travail. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pris des pauses-cigarette avec MM. Postlethwaite et Carson et il a m\u00eame dit que, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 dans une caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria avec MM. Carson et Burke (Transcription de l\u2018audience, \u00e0 la page 181). \u00c0 mon avis, ces faits laissent \u00e9galement planer un doute sur la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage. Il n\u2019est pas raisonnable selon moi que le plaignant ait tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir les bonnes gr\u00e2ces de ses coll\u00e8gues de travail en socialisant avec eux s\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 ce point bless\u00e9 et offens\u00e9 et s\u2019il se sentait victime de discrimination de leur part.\n[65] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9tabli que la discrimination prima facie reproch\u00e9e n\u2019a pas eu lieu.\nV. Conclusion [66] En \u00e9valuant la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant par rapport \u00e0 celle des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la conduite discriminatoire prima facie n\u2019a pas eu lieu comme le pr\u00e9tend le plaignant.\n[67] En cons\u00e9quence, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSusheel Gupta\nPr\u00e9sident du tribunal par int\u00e9rim\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 6 juin 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1610\/15610\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Todd Chaudhary c.

Le contexte [1] Les plaignants, l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (l\u2019APN) et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations (la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien) ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, all\u00e9guant que le financement in\u00e9quitable des services de bien-\u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019enfance fournis dans les r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, ce qui est contraire aux dispositions de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi). La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 14 octobre 2008.\n[2] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte au motif que les questions soulev\u00e9es exc\u00e9daient la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal (la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence). Dans une d\u00e9cision publi\u00e9e sous la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence 2011 TCDP 4, le Tribunal s\u2019est prononc\u00e9 sur la requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence le 14 mars 2011 et il y a fait droit, rejetant ainsi la plainte. Cette d\u00e9cision a par la suite fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le 18 avril 2012, celle-ci a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 une formation coll\u00e9giale pour un r\u00e9examen de l\u2019affaire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses motifs (2012 CF 445). Le 10 juillet 2012, une formation constitu\u00e9e de Mme Marchildon et MM. Lustig et B\u00e9langer, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour entendre la pr\u00e9sente affaire (2012 TCDP 16).\nII. Les faits pertinents [3] Le 26 septembre 2012, le Tribunal a tenu une conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance en personne (CGI) afin de v\u00e9rifier les disponibilit\u00e9s des parties pour pr\u00e9voir des dates pour l\u2019audience sur le fond. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 un ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure, en attendant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le dossier 2012 CF 445, dont l\u2019audience devait avoir lieu devant la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en mars 2013. La formation a rendu sa d\u00e9cision, rejetant la requ\u00eate en ajournement. Sur consentement des parties, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli les dates d\u2019audience pour la semaine du 25 f\u00e9vrier au 1er mars 2013, comme le demandaient les plaignants, et a \u00e9tabli les autres dates d\u2019audience \u00e0 partir d\u2019avril 2013, comme le demandait l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le Tribunal a aussi \u00e9tabli, sur consentement, un calendrier de production continue des documents \u00e0 divulguer, y compris des listes r\u00e9vis\u00e9es des t\u00e9moins. L\u2019intim\u00e9 devait d\u00e9poser ses divulgations en trois temps : le 31 octobre 2012, le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2012 et le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re divulgation et sa deuxi\u00e8me Liste compl\u00e9mentaire des documents le 29 octobre 2012 et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa troisi\u00e8me Liste compl\u00e9mentaire des documents le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n[5] Le 22 janvier 2013, le Tribunal a tenu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance (CTGI). Pendant l\u2019appel, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle d\u00e9poserait sa divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire le plus rapidement possible, probablement avant le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 que, pour sa part, il serait en mesure de respecter l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013, comme il l\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu pendant la conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance (CGI) du 26 septembre 2012, pour sa troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re divulgation.\n[6] La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur quatri\u00e8me Liste compl\u00e9mentaire des documents le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2013 et le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2013, respectivement.\n[7] L\u2019audience a commenc\u00e9 le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Cindy Blackstock, directrice administrative de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, du 25 f\u00e9vrier au 1er mars 2013. Ce t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivi de cinq jours suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019audience, les 2, 3, 4, 8 et 9 avril 2013, au cours desquels le Tribunal a entendu le t\u00e9moignage de M. Jonathan Simpson, directeur du Secr\u00e9tariat \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et au d\u00e9veloppement social de l\u2019APN, de M. Nicolas Trocm\u00e9, directeur du Centre de recherche sur l\u2019enfance et la famille de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 McGill, et de M. Derald Dubois, directeur administratif de Touchwood Child and Family Services en Saskatchewan.\n[8] Le 6 mars 2013, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a entendu l\u2019appel de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le dossier 2012 CF 445, qui renvoyait l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce au Tribunal pour nouvelle instruction. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu sa d\u00e9cision 2013 CAF 75 quelques jours plus tard, le 11 mars 2013, confirmant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[9] Le 24 avril 2013, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une lettre de M. Champ, avocat pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, divulguant l\u2019existence d\u2019un CD-ROM contenant des renseignements que sa cliente, Mme Blackstock, avait re\u00e7us le 9 avril 2013 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande de [traduction] \u00ab renseignements sur l\u2019approche ou le mod\u00e8le de financement am\u00e9lior\u00e9 pour les services \u00e0 l\u2019enfance des Premi\u00e8res Nations, dat\u00e9s ou possiblement dat\u00e9s du 1er novembre 2011 au 31 octobre 2012 \u00bb, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information (la LAI). La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que l\u2019ensemble des documents re\u00e7us en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande, qui totalisait environ 4000 pages, contenait des documents hautement pertinents quant \u00e0 la plainte qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien pr\u00e9tend aussi qu\u2019une partie de ces documents r\u00e9v\u00e8le l\u2019existence de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de documents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus en application d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019exemptions pr\u00e9vues par la LAI, qui ne s\u2019appliquent pas au devoir de divulgation dans des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires comme celles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[10] Le 7 mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la communication de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien du 24 avril 2013, d\u00e9clarant que, comme il l\u2019avait exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les CTGI depuis la reprise de l\u2019affaire en 2012, il poss\u00e9dait un grand nombre de documents qui n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et que cette divulgation \u00e9tait continue. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait tout juste \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 par son client que plus de 50 000 documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, qui n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 cibl\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant possiblement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, documents que le client recueillait pr\u00e9sentement. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 qu\u2019un nombre ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 de courriels \u00e9tait aussi vis\u00e9 par la divulgation et que la date pr\u00e9vue pour la fin de la cueillette, de l\u2019organisation et du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces documents \u00e9tait entre septembre et d\u00e9cembre 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie de ces documents provenait des r\u00e9gions ainsi que de l\u2019administration centrale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait avoir maintenant divulgu\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 des documents jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2010.\n[11] Le 9 mai 2013, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette lettre, d\u00e9clarant que, bien qu\u2019elle reconnaissait qu\u2019une divulgation continue \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue, elle n\u2019avait jamais envisag\u00e9 ou compris qu\u2019il restait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un aussi grand nombre de documents pertinents \u00e0 divulguer. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien avait plut\u00f4t compris que les obligations de divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avaient, en grande partie, \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaites en date du 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le d\u00e9lai que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9voyait entre septembre et d\u00e9cembre 2013 \u00e9tait inacceptable, parce que cela entra\u00eenerait la divulgation d\u2019un grand nombre de documents pertinents apr\u00e8s que tous les t\u00e9moins aient t\u00e9moign\u00e9. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a avis\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de son intention de soulever la question aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal le 13 mai 2013 et de demander une ordonnance obligeant l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 produire toute sa divulgation au plus tard le 14 juin 2013.\n[12] Le 13 mai 2013, le Tribunal a repris l\u2019audience pour la troisi\u00e8me semaine. Compte tenu des derniers \u00e9changes au sujet des questions de divulgation, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles voulaient profiter de plus de temps pour discuter de ces questions entre elles et tenter d\u2019arriver \u00e0 une entente. Les parties ont accept\u00e9 et le Tribunal a ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019audience pour la journ\u00e9e. Le lendemain, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 14 mai 2013, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que, malgr\u00e9 leurs discussions, les parties n\u2019\u00e9taient pas parvenues \u00e0 une entente.\nIII. La requ\u00eate en ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et la requ\u00eate en ordonnance de production de la plaignante [13] Le 15 mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate demandant une ordonnance fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 1(6) et les alin\u00e9as 3(2)d), 5(3)d) et 5(3)f) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal), pour faire ajourner les dates d\u2019audience pr\u00e9vues en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation. Ces articles se lisent comme suit :\n1(6) Le membre instructeur conserve le pouvoir de se prononcer sur toute question de proc\u00e9dure non pr\u00e9vue par les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles.\n1(6) The Panel retains the jurisdiction to decide any matter of procedure not provided for by these Rules.\n3(2) D\u00e8s r\u00e9ception de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate, le membre instructeur\nd) doit disposer de la requ\u00eate de la fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9e.\n3(2) Upon receipt of a Notice of Motion, the Panel\n(d) shall dispose of the motion as it sees fit.\n5(3) \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire, le membre instructeur\nd) peut fixer les dates d\u2019audience;\nf) peut traiter de toute autre question ayant trait au d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure.\n5(3) At the case conference the Panel,\n(d) may set dates for the hearing of the inquiry;\n(f) may deal with any other matters necessary for the conduct of the proceeding.\n[14] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019un ajournement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce serait appropri\u00e9 parce qu\u2019Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (AADNC) a embauch\u00e9 deux entreprises tierces ind\u00e9pendantes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire Public History Inc. (PHI) et Canadian Development Consultants Inc. (CDCI), qui ont cibl\u00e9 environ 50 000 documents qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte et qui ne seront pas divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 avant le 30 septembre 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, lorsqu\u2019il aura re\u00e7u ces documents, il devra les examiner pour en confirmer la pertinence et v\u00e9rifier qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun privil\u00e8ge avant de les divulguer aux autres parties, ce qui prendra plus de temps.\n[15] Comme ces documents pourraient contenir des renseignements qui sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9 note qu\u2019ils seront peut-\u00eatre aussi pertinents pour l\u2019interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par les parties. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, compte tenu des principes de justice naturelle, un ajournement assurerait que le dossier du Tribunal est complet et que toutes les parties ont l\u2019occasion de recevoir et d\u2019examiner les documents, ainsi que de bien comprendre les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi. Cela garantirait le meilleur usage des ressources judiciaires parce que, si l\u2019audience proc\u00e8de selon l\u2019horaire d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli, il est possible que des t\u00e9moins doivent \u00eatre rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 de nouveaux renseignements qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles au moment o\u00f9 ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9.\n[16] Le 21 mai 2013, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son propre avis de requ\u00eate, demandant une ordonnance :\n[traduction]\n[O]bligeant l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 produire les documents pertinents quant \u00e0 la plainte et \u00e0 fournir des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun de ses t\u00e9moins, accordant les d\u00e9pens pour entrave au processus du Tribunal et toute autre mesure de redressement que l\u2019avocat pourrait demander et que le Tribunal puisse permettre.\n[17] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien pr\u00e9tend que, malgr\u00e9 le fait que l\u2019audience sur le fond de l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a commenc\u00e9 le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a que r\u00e9cemment admis qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait des dizaines de milliers de documents possiblement pertinents qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas divulgu\u00e9s aux parties. En plus du d\u00e9faut de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus de ses t\u00e9moins, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019obligation pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi manqu\u00e9 aux paragraphes 1(1), 6(1) et \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(5)b) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien note aussi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a constamment manqu\u00e9 aux d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal pour la divulgation des documents, ainsi que pour la pr\u00e9sentation des listes de t\u00e9moins et des rapports d\u2019experts.\n[18] Pour plus de facilit\u00e9, nous avons reproduit les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal susmentionn\u00e9es. Elles sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9es ainsi :\n1(1) Les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles ont pour objet de permettre\na) que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\nb) que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace;\nc) que toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible.\n1(1) These Rules are enacted to ensure that\n(a) all parties to an inquiry have the full and ample opportunity to be heard;\n(b) arguments and evidence be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner; and\n(c) all proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as possible.\n6(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\na) les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause;\nb) sa position au sujet des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause;\nc) le redressement recherch\u00e9;\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\ne) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\nf) les noms des divers t\u00e9moins \u2013 autres que les t\u00e9moins experts \u2013 qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d\u2019eux.\n6(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\n(a) the material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case;\n(b) its position on the legal issues raised by the case;\n(c) the relief that it seeks;\n(d) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(e) a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule;\n(f) a list identifying all witnesses the party intends to call, other than expert witnesses, together with a summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness.\n6(5) Une partie doit divulguer et produire les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u00e9cessaires\nb) si elle constate qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e correctement ou compl\u00e8tement aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d), 6(1)e) et 6(1)f) ou aux paragraphes 6(3) ou 6(4).\n6(5) A party shall provide such additional disclosure and production as is necessary\n(b) where the party discovers that its compliance with 6(1)(d), 6(1)(e), 6(1)(f), 6(3) or 6(4) is inaccurate or incomplete.\n[19] Le Tribunal a entendu les deux requ\u00eates le 21 et le 22 mai 2013.\n[20] Le Tribunal a d\u2019abord entendu la requ\u00eate en ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Pia Newell Santiago, copr\u00e9sidente de PHI, de Mme Laurie Howe, gestionnaire de projet chez CDCI et de Mme Janice Mah, parajuriste au minist\u00e8re de la Justice du Canada.\n[21] La preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que PHI fournissait des services de recherche et de gestion des documents \u00e0 AADNC en vue de la divulgation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce depuis 2008 et qu\u2019elle avait commenc\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tape actuelle de recherche et de gestion des documents en octobre 2012. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, PHI a avis\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la date pr\u00e9vue de fin de projet \u00e9tait la fin mars 2013, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que cette date doive \u00eatre report\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9. Le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet du grand nombre de documents qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s (et du grand nombre de documents qui restaient \u00e0 examiner) en raison de la port\u00e9e \u00e9tendue des questions en jeu. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait restreint la port\u00e9e de la pertinence en 2012, Mme Newell Santiago a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la recherche et la gestion de documents qui restaient \u00e0 effectuer \u00e9taient laborieuses parce que la port\u00e9e de la pertinence avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largie afin de comprendre les dossiers de tous les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux d\u2019AADNC, en plus de ceux de l\u2019administration centrale d\u2019AADNC.\n[22] Mme Newell Santiago a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en janvier ou en f\u00e9vrier 2013, PHI avait discut\u00e9 avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet du fait que le traitement des documents des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux d\u2019AADNC constituait un travail trop lourd pour l\u2019entreprise. PHI a recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019exception des courriels provenant des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux, la recherche et la pr\u00e9paration de documents pour les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux soient attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 une autre entreprise. PHI a confirm\u00e9 que la date actuelle pr\u00e9vue pour la fin de sa partie du travail \u00e9tait le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013, une date qui, selon Mme Newell Santiago, a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 au plus tard \u00e0 la mi-mars 2013. Cependant, lorsque la Commission l\u2019a contre-interrog\u00e9e, Mme Newell Santiago a not\u00e9 que, si le traitement des courriels r\u00e9gionaux \u00e9tait retir\u00e9 de leur liste de t\u00e2ches, la date de fin pr\u00e9vue du 31 ao\u00fbt 2013 pourrait \u00eatre devanc\u00e9e \u00e0 la mi-juillet 2013.\n[23] Mme Howe a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a communiqu\u00e9 avec CDCI le 14 mars 2013, soit, note le Tribunal, trois jours apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale 2013 CAF 75. Le m\u00eame jour, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 leur aide et, par voie de contrat finalis\u00e9, a retenu leurs services le 15 avril 2013. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ce contrat, CDCI devait entreprendre la cueillette de documents \u00e9lectroniques des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux d\u2019AADNC \u00e0 partir d\u2019avril 2009 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour; la cueillette des courriels du bureau r\u00e9gional de Qu\u00e9bec et la cueillette de tout petit document papier des bureaux r\u00e9gionaux. Mme Howe a soulign\u00e9 les d\u00e9fis que repr\u00e9sentait la production d\u2019un aussi grand volume de documents dans un aussi court laps de temps, d\u00e9clarant que la date pr\u00e9vue de fin du projet pour CDCI \u00e9tait au plus t\u00f4t le 30 septembre 2013.\n[24] La preuve a aussi r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que ni PHI, ni CDCI n\u2019\u00e9tait responsable de la recherche et de la pr\u00e9paration de documents provenant de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la v\u00e9rification et de l\u2019\u00e9valuation d\u2019AADNC, un domaine qui, comme l\u2019ont soulign\u00e9 les plaignants, \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a par la suite confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019une troisi\u00e8me entreprise inconnue avait r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour obtenir tous les documents pertinents de cette direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de fournir plus de d\u00e9tails sur ce contrat de service.\n[25] Le Tribunal a par la suite entendu, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien pour la divulgation, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Blackstock, directrice administrative de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien. Mme Blackstock a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point l\u2019examen du grand nombre de documents divulgu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce constituait un lourd fardeau pour leur petit organisme et aussi la surprise et l\u2019inconv\u00e9nient caus\u00e9 par la d\u00e9couverte, \u00e0 la suite de sa derni\u00e8re demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information, que deux tiers de la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Mme Blackstock expliquait que certaines parties de la divulgation pendante, comme les \u00e9valuations et les v\u00e9rifications de la formule \u00ab approche am\u00e9lior\u00e9e \u00bb dans les provinces de la Saskatchewan, de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, du Manitoba, de l\u2019Alberta, de l\u2019\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard et du Qu\u00e9bec, \u00e9taient particuli\u00e8rement pertinentes quant \u00e0 leur cause, en particulier compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu que les t\u00e9moins du Manitoba t\u00e9moignent lors des dates d\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en mai 2013. Mme Blackstock a soutenu qu\u2019en plus, les documents divulgu\u00e9s en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information montraient que l\u2019\u00e9quipe de litiges de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait ces documents en sa possession depuis l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2012, ce qui entra\u00eene la question de savoir pourquoi ces documents n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s auparavant. Mme Blackstock a aussi soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien n\u2019a re\u00e7u qu\u2019une liste incompl\u00e8te des t\u00e9moins et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[26] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Mme Blackstock a soulign\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 aux 161 000 enfants touch\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente plainte, en raison des retards en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Mme Blackstock a soutenu qu\u2019un ajournement, qui causerait des retards suppl\u00e9mentaires, ne ferait qu\u2019exacerber ce pr\u00e9judice.\nIV. Les observations des parties A. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande un ajournement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que toute la divulgation soit termin\u00e9e. Compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les entreprises tierces embauch\u00e9es pour pr\u00e9parer la divulgation et compte tenu du temps dont il aura besoin pour examiner les divulgations fournies, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019audience devrait \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9e jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but novembre 2013.\n[28] Bien qu\u2019il comprenne le d\u00e9sir des parties de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction le plus rapidement possible, l\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que ce d\u00e9sir doit \u00eatre soupes\u00e9 avec le besoin de garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus, en particulier compte tenu de la nature importante de l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape actuelle de la proc\u00e9dure, les t\u00e9moignages de la majorit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus ne seraient pas affect\u00e9s par la divulgation tardive. Cependant, selon lui, le fait de poursuivre l\u2019audience selon l\u2019horaire pr\u00e9vu, o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moins t\u00e9moigneraient avant que la divulgation des documents soit compl\u00e8te, pourrait cr\u00e9er une situation o\u00f9 les t\u00e9moignages seraient affect\u00e9s, ce qui soul\u00e8verait des questions d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n[29] Se fondant sur ses propres notes de la CGI du 26 septembre 2012 (en raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me technique, cette conf\u00e9rence n\u2019a malheureusement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e), l\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi not\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait avis\u00e9 toutes les parties \u00e0 cette date qu\u2019il fournirait une divulgation continue et qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 divulguer environ 30 000 documents. L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que, bien qu\u2019il ait pu y avoir un malentendu au sujet du nombre de documents qui restaient \u00e0 divulguer, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait soulev\u00e9 la question de l\u2019existence de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires possiblement pertinents aupr\u00e8s des parties aussit\u00f4t qu\u2019il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9.\n[30] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a exprim\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 de travailler avec les parties afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir un horaire raisonnable pour garantir que la divulgation soit compl\u00e9t\u00e9e et ainsi proc\u00e9der de la fa\u00e7on la plus juste et efficace possible.\nB. La position de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien [31] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir qu\u2019il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu manquement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale parce que deux semaines d\u2019audience se sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9coul\u00e9es et que les parties ont seulement r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9es du grand nombre de documents qu\u2019il restait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait aussi valoir que, selon ce qu\u2019elle avait compris au sujet de la divulgation continue, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devait divulguer des documents et des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui avaient vu le jour apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure et que cela ne comprenait pas, contrairement aux pr\u00e9tentions de l\u2019intim\u00e9, la divulgation d\u2019un grand nombre de documents produits avant le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[32] Cela dit, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que les r\u00e9percussions de la divulgation tardive de l\u2019intim\u00e9 restent conjecturales et ne justifient pas un ajournement de neuf semaines des dates d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est d\u2019avis que toute pr\u00e9occupation quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, d\u00e9coulant du fait que les t\u00e9moins t\u00e9moigneraient avant la divulgation compl\u00e8te, peut \u00eatre corrig\u00e9e de diverses fa\u00e7ons, y compris en demandant de rappeler des t\u00e9moins afin qu\u2019ils t\u00e9moignent au sujet de documents qui n\u2019avaient pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s lors de leur premier t\u00e9moignage. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est \u00e9videmment id\u00e9al que tous les documents soient divulgu\u00e9s avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019on les soup\u00e8se avec le pr\u00e9judice tr\u00e8s r\u00e9el qu\u2019un retard suppl\u00e9mentaire causerait aux plaignants, ces hypoth\u00e9tiques manquements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e0 venir ne justifient pas l\u2019ajournement demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9. En effet, les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui sont touch\u00e9s d\u00e9favorablement par les actes cens\u00e9ment discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pourront jamais r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer ces premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de formation scolaire pass\u00e9es loin de la maison.\n[33] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien note que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Newell Santiago a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait su en janvier ou en f\u00e9vrier 2013 qu\u2019un grand nombre de documents ne serait pas disponible pour la divulgation avant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 et pourtant, il n\u2019en a avis\u00e9 les parties que tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Howe a aussi r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a communiqu\u00e9 avec CDCI pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 la mi-mars 2013, l\u2019entreprise avait donn\u00e9 une date pr\u00e9vue de fin des travaux pour la fin juillet 2013, ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi omis de communiquer aux autres parties. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait valoir que cette preuve, ajout\u00e9e au d\u00e9faut de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir une explication justifiant la raison pour laquelle il n\u2019avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 traiter ces documents pertinents que tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment, devrait entra\u00eener une conclusion d\u00e9favorable; ces documents auraient pu ne jamais \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de Mme Blackstock. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien est d\u2019avis que le fait d\u2019accorder l\u2019ajournement ne ferait qu\u2019ent\u00e9riner ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab le manquement volontaire [de l\u2019intim\u00e9] aux R\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u00bb. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver une seule affaire o\u00f9 une partie avait omis de divulguer des documents et avait ensuite demand\u00e9 un ajournement pour ce motif.\n[34] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien fait aussi valoir que la demande d\u2019ajournement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aurait des r\u00e9percussions sur le fonctionnement du Tribunal, qui aura \u00e0 lib\u00e9rer toutes les dates d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues et devra trouver de nouvelles dates qui auraient autrement pu servir \u00e0 l\u2019audition d\u2019autres plaintes. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision Zhou v. National Research Council, 2009 CHRT 11, dans laquelle le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, pour d\u00e9cider d\u2019accorder un ajournement, le Tribunal devait tenir compte du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 au syst\u00e8me entier du Tribunal (aux paragraphes 7 et 8).\n[35] Enfin, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien note que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi omis de fournir une liste compl\u00e8te de t\u00e9moins et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s, malgr\u00e9 de nombreuses demandes, et en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)f) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, et que le Tribunal devrait lui ordonner de d\u00e9poser ces renseignements.\nC. La position de la Commission [36] La Commission est d\u2019avis que le besoin de proc\u00e9der le plus rapidement possible doit \u00eatre soupes\u00e9 avec le besoin de garantir que le processus avance de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et en pr\u00e9sence de la preuve la plus compl\u00e8te possible. Bien qu\u2019on puisse au d\u00e9part \u00e9conomiser du temps en refusant d\u2019ajourner les dates d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues, la Commission note que ces \u00e9conomies seront probablement annul\u00e9es par les retards caus\u00e9s par le fait de rappeler des t\u00e9moins et risqueront de compromettre la qualit\u00e9 du dossier et du t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins. Poursuivre les audiences sans avoir conclu la divulgation pourrait aussi entra\u00eener la cr\u00e9ation de failles dans le dossier qui pourraient \u00eatre probl\u00e9matiques s\u2019il devait y avoir contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[37] Cela dit, la Commission ne souscrit pas \u00e0 la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle il faudrait commencer les audiences en novembre ou en d\u00e9cembre 2013. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission a adopt\u00e9 ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit comme une position mod\u00e9r\u00e9e. Selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Newell Santiago et par Mme Howe, si les parties acceptent de dispenser PHI et CDCI de l\u2019obligation de renvoi relative \u00e0 la LAI et de codage de la divulgation, alors PHI serait en mesure de fournir la divulgation \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin juin et CDCI pourrait faire de m\u00eame pour la fin juillet 2013. La Commission propose donc :\na. que la requ\u00eate portant sur les repr\u00e9sailles soit entendue en juin;\nb. que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fournisse une divulgation progressive jusqu\u2019au 26 juillet 2013;\nc. que la Commission pr\u00e9sente sa cause sur le fond au d\u00e9but ao\u00fbt et termine son interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins au plus tard \u00e0 la mi-septembre.\n[38] La Commission demande, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une situation o\u00f9 les parties seraient forc\u00e9es de pr\u00e9senter des demandes d\u2019ajournement plus tard, que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance d\u00e9taillant le calendrier de divulgation propos\u00e9 et fournisse une date butoir pour la production de la liste des t\u00e9moins et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s.\n[39] Bien que l\u2019APN note qu\u2019elle partage certaines des pr\u00e9occupations de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien en ce qui a trait au comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 quant au traitement de la divulgation des documents et aux violations fr\u00e9quentes des d\u00e9lais, l\u2019APN appuie n\u00e9anmoins la position et le calendrier propos\u00e9s par la Commission. Les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario (les COO) appuient aussi la position de la Commission.\nV. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements depuis l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate [40] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 24 mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s de plus amples discussions avec les entreprises ind\u00e9pendantes qui \u00e9taient charg\u00e9es de l\u2019obtention des documents \u00e0 divulguer, PHI avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle serait en mesure de fournir les documents \u00e0 divulguer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 au plus tard le 2 juillet 2013 et CDCI avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pouvait le faire au plus tard le 31 juillet 2013. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait en mesure de fournir une divulgation progressive \u00e0 certains intervalles en juin, juillet et ao\u00fbt et qu\u2019il terminerait sa divulgation au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait alors en mesure de proc\u00e9der en ce qui concerne les audiences relatives \u00e0 la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2013, et de reprendre l\u2019audition du fond de l\u2019affaire en septembre 2013. Bien qu\u2019il ait d\u2019abord not\u00e9 que cela d\u00e9pendrait du renoncement des parties \u00e0 la divulgation des courriels, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ensuite confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il pourrait compl\u00e9ter la divulgation, y compris les courriels, au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les documents des r\u00e9gions pouvaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s dans l\u2019ordre suivant : Atlantique, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Qu\u00e9bec, Alberta, Colombie\u2011Britannique et Yukon.\n[41] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 28 mai 2013, la Commission, sans renoncer \u00e0 ses droits, a consenti \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 condition que les courriels de l\u2019intim\u00e9 fassent partie de la divulgation. La Commission a aussi not\u00e9 que la troisi\u00e8me compagnie inconnue, avec qui l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait sign\u00e9 un contrat pour traiter la production des documents portant sur les \u00e9valuations et les v\u00e9rifications, devait respecter les d\u00e9lais pr\u00e9vus. La Commission a propos\u00e9 que l\u2019audience sur le fond reprenne le 3 septembre 2013.\n[42] Les COO ont envoy\u00e9 un courriel le m\u00eame jour, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la position de la Commission. L\u2019APN a aussi envoy\u00e9 une lettre dat\u00e9e du 28 mai 2013, dans laquelle elle appuyait la position de la Commission, \u00e0 condition que la Commission et les plaignants puissent rappeler les t\u00e9moins. L\u2019APN a aussi soulign\u00e9 l\u2019importance de pr\u00e9voir des dates d\u2019audience jusqu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2013 afin de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de clore sa preuve et de garantir que l\u2019audience se termine le plus rapidement possible.\n[43] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a aussi r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir pris connaissance de la r\u00e9ponse de la Commission. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a continu\u00e9 d\u2019exprimer son objection \u00e0 l\u2019ajournement, notant que les r\u00e9percussions de la divulgation tardive restaient hypoth\u00e9tiques et que cela ne justifiait pas un ajournement de neuf semaines d\u2019audiences d\u00e9j\u00e0 au calendrier, en particulier compte tenu du pr\u00e9judice subi par les enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s par les actes cens\u00e9ment discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[44] Le 29 mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces lettres, exprimant sa satisfaction au sujet du fait que la Commission, les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario et l\u2019APN acceptaient les dates que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait propos\u00e9es pour la divulgation dans sa derni\u00e8re lettre. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019objection de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les t\u00e9moins montraient clairement qu\u2019il restait des documents importants et pertinents \u00e0 divulguer, ce qui appuyait la requ\u00eate en ajournement.\n[45] Le 30 mai 2013, le Tribunal a tenu une CTGI, au cours de laquelle la Commission a fourni une proposition d\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier mis \u00e0 jour. Cette proposition comprenait les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\na. l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de dates d\u2019audience pour la question des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 tout moment au cours des dates d\u2019audience d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues en juin, juillet et ao\u00fbt;\nb. l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du 30 ao\u00fbt 2013 comme date butoir pour la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9;\nc. l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du 3 septembre 2013 pour le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience sur le fond.\n[46] L\u2019APN et les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario ont appuy\u00e9 cette proposition. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a maintenu son objection \u00e0 l\u2019ajournement, mentionnant ses observations du 28 mai 2013.\nVI. La d\u00e9cision-lettre [47] Pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par les questions pratiques de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur les deux requ\u00eates et par le d\u00e9sir de fournir aux parties une plus grande certitude que l\u2019audience se poursuivrait le plus rapidement possible, le Tribunal a rendu une d\u00e9cision par lettre le 3 juin 2013, dont les motifs devaient suivre. Le texte de la d\u00e9cision est le suivant :\n[traduction]\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision en style t\u00e9l\u00e9graphique au sujet de la requ\u00eate en ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de la requ\u00eate de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada pour une ordonnance de production, ainsi qu\u2019au sujet des d\u00e9pens. Les motifs de la d\u00e9cision suivront. La question des d\u00e9pens est prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et fera l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u00e0 venir.\nLa requ\u00eate en ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est accueillie en partie; la requ\u00eate de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada pour une ordonnance de production est accueillie en partie.\nLa CCDP, l\u2019APN et les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario consentent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en ajournement de l\u2019audience dans l\u2019affaire susmentionn\u00e9e et acceptent que l\u2019audience reprenne le 3 septembre 2013, \u00e0 condition que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente une divulgation pleine et enti\u00e8re, qui doit \u00eatre termin\u00e9e au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013. La CCDP, l\u2019APN et les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario consentent aussi \u00e0 ce que l\u2019audience au sujet des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles ait lieu au cours des semaines d\u2019audiences d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2013. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, l\u2019APN, la CCDP et les Chefs de l\u2019Ontario conservent le droit de rappeler des t\u00e9moins au besoin. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ne consent pas \u00e0 l\u2019ajournement des dates d\u2019audience.\nLa d\u00e9cision de la formation du Tribunal est la suivante :\nLes dates d\u2019audience de juin 2013 sont ajourn\u00e9es. L\u2019audience reprendra le 15 juillet 2013 et se poursuivra jusqu\u2019au 26 juillet 2013 pour couvrir les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. De plus, trois jours seront r\u00e9serv\u00e9s en ao\u00fbt 2013 pour terminer l\u2019audience au sujet des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, si la p\u00e9riode de deux semaines en juillet n\u2019est pas suffisante. Ces dates seront du 6 au 8 ao\u00fbt 2013.\nL\u2019audience sur le fond reprendra au cours des dates restantes qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9vues du 12 au 16 ao\u00fbt 2013 et du 26 au 30 ao\u00fbt 2013. L\u2019audience se poursuivra en septembre et au cours de l\u2019automne jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019audience sur le fond soit termin\u00e9e, selon les disponibilit\u00e9s de la formation et des parties, dont il sera question lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence du 6 juin 2013. Vous trouverez en pi\u00e8ces jointes une lettre \u00e9tablissant les disponibilit\u00e9s de la formation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nLa divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre termin\u00e9e au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fournira la divulgation aux parties en fonction du calendrier fourni par la Commission, en date du 28 mai 2013. Les parties doivent pr\u00e9ciser le contenu de la divulgation en fonction du calendrier \u00e9tabli lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence du 6 juin 2013. Si les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas \u00e0 ce sujet, la formation rendra une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce sujet au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 elle rendra ses motifs relativement aux deux requ\u00eates.\nLes parties auront le droit de rappeler des t\u00e9moins au besoin et sur approbation de la formation. Cela sera d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en fonction de chaque cas, apr\u00e8s un examen de chaque situation.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9posera sa liste des t\u00e9moins et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s pour l\u2019audience au sujet des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles au plus tard le 2 juillet 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9posera sa liste de t\u00e9moins et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s pour l\u2019audience sur le fond au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[48] Les motifs de cette d\u00e9cision suivent.\nVII. Analyse et d\u00e9cision [49] Les deux requ\u00eates en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme les parties le reconnaissent elles-m\u00eames, repr\u00e9sentent essentiellement les deux c\u00f4t\u00e9s d\u2019une m\u00eame m\u00e9daille. Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer, compte tenu de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et des risques de proc\u00e9der sans avoir une divulgation compl\u00e8te, si les circonstances justifient d\u2019accorder l\u2019ajournement demand\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quelle devrait \u00eatre la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019ajournement. Si le Tribunal d\u00e9cide qu\u2019un ajournement n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9 et, comme l\u2019affirme la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, que les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 appuient la position selon laquelle l\u2019audience devrait proc\u00e9der en fonction du calendrier d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tabli, alors le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on la plus appropri\u00e9e de maintenir l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de son processus compte tenu de la grande quantit\u00e9 de documents qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer.\n[50] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et que l\u2019ajournement d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure rel\u00e8ve de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en tenant compte du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi et de l\u2019exigence selon laquelle les proc\u00e9dures doivent \u00eatre tenues de la fa\u00e7on la plus informelle et la plus rapide possible, en respectant les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle : Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 14, 15, 16 et 17; Zhou v. National Research Council, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 4; L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railway Company, d\u00e9cision provisoire, 26 novembre 1999 (TCDP), au paragraphe 6; Marshall c. Cerescorp Co., 2011 TCDP 5; Blain c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2012 TCDP 13.\n[51] Les facteurs dont le Tribunal doit tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comprennent :\na. le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission, aux plaignants et aux enfants qu\u2019ils repr\u00e9sentent si l\u2019on retarde l\u2019audience de plusieurs semaines;\nb. le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission, qui est charg\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve, par le fait de proc\u00e9der sans attendre et d\u2019entendre le t\u00e9moignage de ses t\u00e9moins sans qu\u2019elle puisse b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la divulgation compl\u00e8te de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et qui risquerait ainsi de ne pas avoir tous les documents pertinents;\nc. le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019il est tenu d\u2019examiner la divulgation et de pr\u00e9parer sa cause en peu de temps au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9;\nd. les r\u00e9percussions sur le syst\u00e8me du Tribunal caus\u00e9es par le retard dans la proc\u00e9dure et le besoin de trouver des dates d\u2019audience suppl\u00e9mentaires qui conviennent \u00e0 tous les membres du Tribunal et \u00e0 toutes les parties;\ne. les r\u00e9percussions sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus du Tribunal si la proc\u00e9dure se poursuit sans que la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit compl\u00e8te.\n[52] Comme ces facteurs le d\u00e9montrent, il n\u2019y a aucune solution \u00e9vidente \u00e0 la question \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Au moins une des parties, si ce n\u2019est toutes les parties, subira un pr\u00e9judice, peu importe la d\u00e9cision.\n[53] Nous tenons \u00e0 noter que le comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est loin d\u2019\u00eatre irr\u00e9prochable. Comme le d\u00e9montre la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 la suite de la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information de Mme Blackstock, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a eu connaissance de l\u2019existence d\u2019une partie de ces documents, qui lui sont pr\u00e9judiciables et qui sont tr\u00e8s pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2012 et pourtant, il ne les a pas divulgu\u00e9s. La preuve montre aussi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 savait qu\u2019il serait incapable de terminer sa divulgation le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013, comme cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu depuis octobre 2012. Il y a eu de nombreux moments, y compris les deux CTGI avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, au cours desquels l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu soulever le fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait fort probable qu\u2019il serait incapable de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de divulgation. Le Tribunal, \u00e0 chaque CTGI et dans toutes les communications qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9es aux parties, a constamment r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que, si des questions ou des pr\u00e9occupations survenaient entre les rencontres et les appels, les parties devaient communiquer avec le Tribunal. Ce n\u2019est jamais arriv\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux dates d\u2019audience en avril 2013 en sachant tr\u00e8s bien qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas compl\u00e8tement satisfait \u00e0 son obligation de divulgation. De plus, il venait tout juste de signer un contrat avec CDCI afin que cette entreprise l\u2019aide \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation et il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 par cette entreprise que la production des grandes quantit\u00e9s de documents qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas encore divulgu\u00e9s prendrait au moins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de septembre 2013. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a cach\u00e9 ces renseignements aux parties et au Tribunal. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien a envoy\u00e9 sa lettre au sujet de sa demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a avis\u00e9 les parties et le Tribunal de l\u2019existence des 50 000 documents suppl\u00e9mentaires pendants, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 7 mai 2013 qu\u2019il a envoy\u00e9e peu de temps avant le d\u00e9but de la troisi\u00e8me semaine pr\u00e9vue d\u2019audience.\n[54] Il convient de noter les efforts de toutes les parties \u00e0 une affaire d\u2019une telle ampleur. La Commission, qui est charg\u00e9e de l\u2019affaire, a affect\u00e9 trois avocats au dossier, l\u2019APN a affect\u00e9 deux avocats, et la directrice administrative de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, Mme Blackstock, ou son avocat, M. Paul Champ, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sents tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 ce jour. M\u00eame l\u2019intim\u00e9 a affect\u00e9 quatre avocats \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. De plus, un certain nombre d\u2019intervenants ont consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et de ressources \u00e0 leur participation \u00e0 l\u2019affaire. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 une formation de trois membres, notant qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un grand d\u00e9fi vu la charge de travail du Tribunal et la disponibilit\u00e9 de ses membres : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2012 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 29. Comme la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien le notait, les trois membres d\u00e9sign\u00e9s auraient autrement entendu trois affaires distinctes, comme le veut la pratique habituelle du Tribunal de confier les affaires \u00e0 des membres seuls. Treize semaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9es dans les horaires de tous, les t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9s \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et les salles d\u2019audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9es.\n[55] Comme Mme Karen Jensen, membre du Tribunal, (tel \u00e9tait son titre) l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Zhou, au paragraphe 8 :\n[traduction]\nLe Tribunal doit faire preuve d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 quand il instruit les causes afin de s\u2019acquitter du mandat que le l\u00e9gislateur lui a confi\u00e9 d\u2019entendre et de r\u00e9gler les plaintes de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive (paragr. 48.9(1) de la LCDP; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. AFPC et CCDP, 2008 CF 223, au paragr. 274; Nova Scotia Construction Safety Association, Collins and Kelly c. Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission and Davidson, 2006 NSCA 63, au paragr. 76). La tenue d\u2019une audience exige des ressources financi\u00e8res et humaines consid\u00e9rables. Ces ressources ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9es sans que cela ne s\u00e8me la perturbation dans l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019organisation, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape du processus. De telles perturbations affectent non seulement l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, mais \u00e9galement celui de tous les autres litiges en instance. C\u2019est pourquoi un ajournement n\u2019est accord\u00e9 que dans les cas o\u00f9 aller de l\u2019avant entraverait manifestement la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable.\n[56] Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait communiqu\u00e9 aux autres parties les difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 obtenir la grande quantit\u00e9 de divulgation, le Tribunal, avec les parties, aurait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver une solution qui aurait limit\u00e9 les r\u00e9percussions sur la proc\u00e9dure et sur toutes les parties. En avisant les parties et le Tribunal de ce probl\u00e8me \u00e0 ce qui est maintenant plus tard que la derni\u00e8re minute, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a enlev\u00e9 cette possibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 tous et a forc\u00e9 le Tribunal, pour \u00eatre franc, \u00e0 passer en mode de limitation des d\u00e9g\u00e2ts. Il convient aussi de mentionner que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est celui qui ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 de son obligation de divulgation, causant un pr\u00e9judice aux autres parties, et c\u2019est pourtant lui qui demande un ajournement.\n[57] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il a avis\u00e9 les parties, lors de la CGI du 26 septembre 2012, que la divulgation serait continue et qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce que sa divulgation contienne environ 30 000 documents, sous-entendant que l\u2019estim\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment ajust\u00e9 de 50 000 documents n\u2019\u00e9tait pas si loin du nombre de d\u00e9part et que cela n\u2019aurait donc pas d\u00fb \u00eatre une surprise pour les parties.\n[58] En toute d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, nous ne sommes pas du m\u00eame avis. La divulgation pr\u00e9vue de 30 000 documents devait \u00eatre faite en trois fois, jusqu\u2019au 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013, et de nombreux milliers de documents ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour. Les 50 000 documents mentionn\u00e9s dans la lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 dat\u00e9e du 7 mai 2013 sont des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires et m\u00eame l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a reconnu. On ne peut pas dire que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait avis\u00e9 les parties au pr\u00e9alable de ce fait. De plus, une obligation de divulgation continue ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme comprenant 50 000 documents pendants, qui repr\u00e9sentent les deux tiers de la divulgation qui reste \u00e0 produire. La Commission et le plaignant, tout comme le Tribunal, avaient compris qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019exception des documents nouvellement cr\u00e9\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait satisfait \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation au plus tard le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Il convient de pr\u00e9ciser que le Tribunal a explicitement confirm\u00e9 avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, au cours de la CGI du 26 septembre 2012, que le calendrier \u00e9tabli pour la divulgation lui donnait suffisamment de temps pour satisfaire \u00e0 son obligation de divulgation.\n[59] Le Tribunal partage les pr\u00e9occupations de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien au sujet de l\u2019ajournement, qui causera des retards dans la proc\u00e9dure. La plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2007 et renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission le 14 octobre 2008, a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par de nombreux retards importants. Cependant, le Tribunal doit aussi tenir compte de son devoir de fournir aux parties l\u2019occasion pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur cause et des observations : L\u00e9ger v. Canadian National Railway Company, d\u00e9cision provisoire, 26 novembre 1999 (TCDP), au paragraphe 6. Voir aussi Zhou v. National Research Council, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 4. Lorsque les compagnies embauch\u00e9es par AADNC auront termin\u00e9 leur travail sur la divulgation et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 en aura termin\u00e9 l\u2019examen, le plaignant et la Commission auront aussi besoin de temps pour effectuer leur propre examen des documents et pr\u00e9parer leur cause en cons\u00e9quence. La Commission, qui, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, est charg\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sentation de la majorit\u00e9 de la preuve, a exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir de proc\u00e9der rapidement sans compromettre la qualit\u00e9 de la preuve. Le Tribunal partage ce d\u00e9sir de la Commission.\n[60] C\u2019est pour ces motifs que le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019accueillir, en partie, tant la requ\u00eate en ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate en production de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien. Comme il l\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9crit dans la d\u00e9cision-lettre reproduite ci-dessus, le Tribunal a annul\u00e9 les dates pr\u00e9vues en juin 2013.

Cela sera d\u00e9termin\u00e9 au cas par cas, apr\u00e8s un examen de chaque situation.\n[63] L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9poser sa liste des t\u00e9moins et ses r\u00e9sum\u00e9s d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s pour les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles au plus tard le 2 juillet 2013.\n[64] L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit d\u00e9poser sa liste des t\u00e9moins et ses r\u00e9sum\u00e9s d\u00e9taill\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s pour l\u2019audience sur le fond de l\u2019affaire au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[65] La divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit \u00eatre termin\u00e9e au plus tard le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013. Comme les parties l\u2019ont convenu lors de la CTGI du 6 juin 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer les documents aux parties de fa\u00e7on continue et progressive toutes les trois semaines, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une divulgation de documents en vrac \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9vue pour la divulgation.\n[66] Les parties ont aussi convenu que la date limite pour la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2012 en ce qui a trait aux recherches portant sur les documents de l\u2019administration centrale d\u2019AADNC, et le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2013 pour les documents de la section de la v\u00e9rification et de l\u2019\u00e9valuation.

Elle soutient que ces documents et renseignements sont n\u00e9cessaires pour qu\u2019elle puisse calculer les indemnit\u00e9s impay\u00e9es que CN doit lui verser pour la perte de salaire, en application de la d\u00e9cision rendue le 29 septembre 2010 par le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu que CN avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers la plaignante en contravention de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la CCDP). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la plaignante demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 CN de produire des renseignements confirmant le taux effectif par kilom\u00e8tre applicable pour les ann\u00e9es 2007 \u00e0 2010 et qu\u2019elle produise la fiche de paie de fin d\u2019ann\u00e9e pour quatre (4) employ\u00e9s, qui \u00e0 son avis sont les comparateurs appropri\u00e9s pour chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[2] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 CN d\u2019indemniser la plaignante pour, notamment, la perte de salaire et d\u2019avantages :\n[183] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour tout le salaire et les avantages qu\u2019elle a perdus, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de ma conclusion au sujet de la date de r\u00e9tablissement, j\u2019ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour toute perte de salaire et d\u2019avantages \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2007 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour. J\u2019ordonne aux parties de calculer le montant du salaire en fonction de la formule pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. En ce qui a trait aux paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019un chef de train peut recevoir, comme il serait difficile pour le Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9tablir un montant, le Tribunal ordonne aux parties qu\u2019elles \u00e9tablissent ce montant en examinant les montants suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un conducteur travaillant dans le terminal qui aurait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable, en supposant que le chef de train n\u2019avait pas d\u2019absences inhabituelles. Par exemple, les parties pourraient tenir compte des paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006.\n[3] Il existe un d\u00e9saccord fondamental entre la plaignante et CN au sujet de la m\u00e9thodologie qui devrait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour calculer le montant de la perte de salaire. Il existe aussi un d\u00e9saccord fondamental entre les parties au sujet des comparateurs qui doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s. Selon la plaignante, les comparateurs utilis\u00e9s par CN ne sont pas appropri\u00e9s parce que l\u2019employ\u00e9 choisi avait des absences inhabituelles et poss\u00e9dait des qualifications diff\u00e9rentes de celles de la plaignante, et que cela avait une incidence directe sur son salaire. La plaignante est d\u2019avis que les comparateurs propos\u00e9s par CN ne sont pas appropri\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils sont soit qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 titre d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur, soit ils ne sont pas qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de chef de train-conducteur de locomotive. Elle soutient que, selon un examen de la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 fournie par CN quant aux comparateurs possibles, quatre (4) autres employ\u00e9s constituent des comparateurs appropri\u00e9s parce qu\u2019ils ont une anciennet\u00e9 semblable \u00e0 la sienne et que, [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 sa connaissance \u00bb, ils sont qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de chef de train-conducteur de locomotive. Elle soutient aussi qu\u2019aucun de ces employ\u00e9s n\u2019est qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur ni n\u2019a eu d\u2019absence inhabituelle pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e.\n[4] CN r\u00e9fute cat\u00e9goriquement ces all\u00e9gations. Selon CN, l\u2019employ\u00e9 dont la p\u00e9riode d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivaut le plus \u00e0 celle de la plaignante, qui n\u2019a pas d\u2019\u00ab absence inhabituelle \u00bb, est l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui est mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. CN soutient que cet employ\u00e9 constitue le comparateur appropri\u00e9 et que, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent du travail, CN s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019employ\u00e9 suivant dans la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. CN soutient que la comparaison qu\u2019elle a utilis\u00e9e \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab plus avantageuse \u00bb pour la plaignante. CN soutient aussi que l\u2019employ\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a choisi \u00e0 titre de comparateur n\u2019avait pas d\u2019\u00ab absence inhabituelle \u00bb.\nI. La question en litige [5] La question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de savoir si le Tribunal devrait ordonner la divulgation des renseignements et des documents demand\u00e9s par la plaignante.\nII. La d\u00e9cision [6] La norme applicable en mati\u00e8re de divulgation de documents est celle de la pertinence possible quant aux questions en litige dans la proc\u00e9dure. En d\u2019autres mots, la plaignante doit \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les renseignements ou les documents qu\u2019elle demande et les questions en litige : Guay c Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42. La pertinence possible des documents doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e au cas par cas, en tenant compte des questions soulev\u00e9es dans chaque cas : Warman c Bahr, 2006 TCDP, 18, au paragraphe 9. De plus, le Tribunal a clairement \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une demande de divulgation \u00ab ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u201cpartie de p\u00eache\u201d \u00bb : Guay c Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 43.\n[7] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, bien que les renseignements demand\u00e9s semblent, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, \u00eatre pertinents, je ne crois pas que l\u2019ordonnance demand\u00e9e devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. J\u2019ai lu les arguments des parties quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, et il est \u00e9vident que la requ\u00eate en production des documents n\u2019est rien de plus qu\u2019une question accessoire \u00e0 la question principale. Ce qui est en jeu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est la question sur le fond. Dans leur m\u00e9moire, les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des faits qui concernent le fond de l\u2019affaire, sans pr\u00e9senter d\u2019affidavit \u00e0 l\u2019appui et sans que les parties aient eu l\u2019occasion de contre\u2011interroger les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019autre partie au sujet de leurs t\u00e9moignages.\n[8] Pour l\u2019instant, je ne vois aucune raison d\u2019accorder l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation demand\u00e9e par la plaignante. L\u2019affaire devrait \u00eatre instruite sur le fond par le Tribunal. CN aura alors le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir que la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e pour calculer le montant des pertes de salaire \u00e0 payer \u00e0 la plaignante est appropri\u00e9e et respecte l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal. La plaignante aura pleinement l\u2019occasion de discr\u00e9diter l\u2019approche de CN, soit en pr\u00e9sentant sa propre preuve, soit en contre interrogeant les t\u00e9moins de CN. Si la plaignante r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que CN n\u2019a pas utilis\u00e9 la m\u00e9thodologie appropri\u00e9e, il reviendra alors au Tribunal, en fonction de la preuve, de rendre l\u2019ordonnance appropri\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les parties devraient traiter la question.\n[9] Il est \u00e9vident, \u00e0 la lecture des observations des parties, qu\u2019elles ont un d\u00e9saccord fondamental au sujet des faits importants entourant la question dont le Tribunal est saisi. Il ne serait pas appropri\u00e9 pour le Tribunal, dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire en divulgation de documents, de tirer une conclusion qui aurait des r\u00e9percussions sur le fond de la question, sans avoir eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019entendre la preuve.\n[10] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate en divulgation de renseignements et de document est, pour l\u2019instant, rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 18 juillet 2013",

La plainte et les requ\u00eates [1] Le 29 juillet 2011, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte de Norman Murray (le plaignant) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 (la CISR ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e).\n[2] Le 10 avril 2012, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance contraignant l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 produire certains documents.\n[3] Le 24 avril 2012, le plaignant a lui aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance contraignant l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 produire certains documents.\n[4] Le 4 juin 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance rejetant la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande, subsidiairement, une ordonnance d\u00e9finissant la port\u00e9e de la plainte, y compris, en particulier, les questions \u00e0 trancher, les groupes ou les classifications \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration, les p\u00e9riodes pr\u00e9cises dont il est question, ainsi que les mesures de redressement qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019ordonner.\n[5] La d\u00e9cision qui suit porte sur ces trois requ\u00eates.\nII. Le contexte A. La plainte relative aux droits de la personne [6] Le 22 avril 2004, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission une plainte relative aux droits de la personne. Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination faisaient suite \u00e0 un incident survenu en avril 2003 entre le plaignant, de race noire, et plusieurs coll\u00e8gues de travail de race blanche, lesquels avaient cens\u00e9ment formul\u00e9 des propos racistes au sujet d\u2019un autre coll\u00e8gue de travail, de race noire. La plainte a tout d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi, mais elle a plus tard \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en vue d\u2019inclure les articles 10 et 12. Le formulaire de plainte comporte, notamment, les all\u00e9gations suivantes :\n[traduction]\n2. Je crois qu\u2019\u00e0 la CISR, la direction a agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard, m\u2019a soumis \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, a incit\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 agir de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard, a cr\u00e9\u00e9 et soutenu un milieu de travail empoisonn\u00e9 qui fait qu\u2019il m\u2019est difficile de faire mon travail et de m\u2019am\u00e9liorer sur le plan professionnel et qui a une incidence d\u00e9favorable sur ma sant\u00e9 du fait de ma race. De plus, je crois qu\u2019\u00e0 la CISR, la direction poursuit syst\u00e9matiquement des pratiques qui me privent en fait de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi du fait de ma race.\n[...]\n18. En ma qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant syndical et de membre du Comit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, j\u2019ai souvent critiqu\u00e9 la CISR pour ses pratiques relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, aux relations interraciales et \u00e0 la discrimination. Cela s\u2019explique par le fait qu\u2019il est officiellement reconnu que la CISR est l\u2019organisme qui, au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comporte le pourcentage le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019employ\u00e9s membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible (la CISR se sert de ce statut favorable lorsque cela lui est avantageux) et, pourtant, ces employ\u00e9s ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient pas d\u2019une situation favorable \u00e0 la CISR car ils continuent d\u2019\u00eatre surconcentr\u00e9s aux niveaux inf\u00e9rieurs de classification. De plus, des actes de racisme, du harc\u00e8lement et des pratiques discriminatoires syst\u00e9miques, qui ont une incidence pr\u00e9judiciable sur les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles, sont fr\u00e9quents dans l\u2019ensemble de la CISR. Ce fait a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 dans des documents accessibles au public, le plus r\u00e9cent \u00e9tant le sondage men\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux. La direction sait que ces probl\u00e8mes existent et n\u2019a pas pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour y rem\u00e9dier. Dans mon cas cependant, jusque-l\u00e0, je n\u2019avais pas \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 cette forme flagrante de racisme et de harc\u00e8lement et je me suis demand\u00e9 si les ann\u00e9es de n\u00e9gligence de la direction face \u00e0 de graves probl\u00e8mes de racisme, de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement n\u2019en \u00e9taient pas le facteur contributif.\n[...]\n56. Je crois qu\u2019\u00e0 la CISR, la direction encourage et appuie le racisme, le harc\u00e8lement et la discrimination. Je crois qu\u2019\u00e0 cause des actes de la direction, le racisme, le harc\u00e8lement et les pratiques discriminatoires ont pris racine et se sont nettement amplifi\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de douze mois. Durant cette derni\u00e8re, \u00e0 cause des actes de la direction le lieu de travail s\u2019est polaris\u00e9 en fonction de lignes de d\u00e9marcation raciales et il s\u2019est empoisonn\u00e9 au point o\u00f9 il m\u2019est impossible de travailler efficacement. Je suis actuellement en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 cause du niveau de stress et d\u2019empoisonnement du lieu de travail, fruit du comportement raciste cumulatif de la direction, \u00e0 la CISR, durant cette p\u00e9riode de douze mois. De plus, mon aptitude \u00e0 faire mon travail en a souffert, mon aptitude \u00e0 rechercher des chances d\u2019avancement en a souffert, mes relations de travail personnelles avec mes coll\u00e8gues en ont souffert et ma vie personnelle, \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la CISR, en a souffert immens\u00e9ment.\n[7] Le 13 avril 2005, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)a) de la Loi, de ne pas instruire la plainte \u00e0 ce stade-l\u00e0. Comme une enqu\u00eate interne de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur la plainte \u00e9tait en cours, la Commission a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis qu\u2019il fallait que ces proc\u00e9dures soient \u00e9puis\u00e9es avant qu\u2019elle puisse proc\u00e9der. L\u2019enqu\u00eate interne, qui n\u2019a port\u00e9 que sur les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement, a conclu que la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e.\n[8] Le 4 juillet 2005, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de donner suite \u00e0 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[9] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019enqu\u00eates men\u00e9es sur la plainte, le 10 ao\u00fbt 2007 la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi, de ne pas statuer sur les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement du plaignant. Elle a toutefois d\u00e9cid\u00e9 aussi, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi, de statuer sur la partie de la plainte sur laquelle l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas port\u00e9. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 19 septembre 2007 et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle allait examiner les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait incit\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 agir de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire envers le plaignant et avait priv\u00e9 ce dernier et d\u2019autres membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019obtenir un emploi permanent du fait de leur race.\n[10] Avant que la Commission rende sa d\u00e9cision, l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de ne pas instruire la plainte au motif qu\u2019une telle mesure occasionnerait un d\u00e9doublement d\u2019instances. En 2007, le plaignant et d\u2019autres personnes ont \u00e9galement port\u00e9 plainte contre la CISR en vertu de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique, L.C. 2003, ch. 22, article 2 (la LRTFP) et de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, L.C. 2003, ch. 22, articles 12 et 13 (la LEFP), lesquelles plaintes sont d\u00e9crites plus en d\u00e9tail ci-apr\u00e8s. Malgr\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission a entrepris de faire enqu\u00eate sur la plainte relative aux droits de la personne du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 de nouveau cette question avant la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[11] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une autre enqu\u00eate, le 20 octobre 2008, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)b) de la Loi, de rejeter la plainte. Se fondant sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, elle a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas omis de fournir au plaignant un lieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite, des r\u00e8gles, des pratiques ou des normes qui privaient le plaignant et d\u2019autres membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019obtenir un emploi permanent du fait de leur race et de leur couleur.\n[12] Une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire portant sur la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission le 20 octobre 2008 a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le 18 ao\u00fbt 2009, avec le consentement des parties, la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie en partie par la juge Hansen. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle concernait les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et elle a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission la question de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en vue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate suppl\u00e9mentaire. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019examiner la situation des minorit\u00e9s visibles au bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au cours des douze mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, et ce, en faisant express\u00e9ment r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux aspects suivants : a) la surconcentration de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles dans des postes de niveau inf\u00e9rieur et b) la sous-repr\u00e9sentation de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles dans des postes permanents. Inutile de dire qu\u2019ayant consenti \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, aucune des parties n\u2019a interjet\u00e9 appel. Par ailleurs, la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019avait la Commission en vertu de la Loi de traiter des questions \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles la Cour avait rendu une ordonnance n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en doute ou consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme entrant en conflit avec une autre loi par une partie quelconque avant la tenue de la pr\u00e9sente instance, hormis ce qui est d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 10 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de.\n[13] Apr\u00e8s une enqu\u00eate suppl\u00e9mentaire sur la plainte, la Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, de demander que le Tribunal instruise la plainte. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 29 juillet 2011 et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Commission a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une instruction parce que :\n\u2022 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis montraient qu\u2019entre le 1er mars 2003 et le 17 mars 2004, des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles en poste au bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de la CISR semblaient surconcentr\u00e9s dans des postes de niveau inf\u00e9rieur, au sein des cat\u00e9gories PM, AS et CR;\n\u2022 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis montraient que des membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles en poste au bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de la CISR, lorsqu\u2019on leur offrait des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi int\u00e9rimaire, se les voyaient offrir principalement dans les cat\u00e9gories de niveau inf\u00e9rieur;\n\u2022 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis montraient aussi qu\u2019au sein du bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de la CISR, il pouvait exister un obstacle qui emp\u00eachait les PM\u201101 d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019avancement au sein de la CISR;\n\u2022 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve recueillis montraient qu\u2019au sein du bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de la CISR, les membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles semblaient \u00eatre sous\u2011repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au sein des \u00e9chelons de niveau sup\u00e9rieur, comme les niveaux PM\u201105 et PM\u201106.\n[14] Dans sa lettre au Tribunal, dat\u00e9e elle aussi du 29 juillet 2011, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nJe vous \u00e9cris pour vous informer que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a examin\u00e9 la plainte (20040576) de Norm Murray \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9.\nLa Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte, car elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances, qu\u2019un examen est justifi\u00e9.\nVous trouverez ci-jointe une copie du formulaire de plainte. Le formulaire no 1, qui comporte des informations sur le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sera transmis par la Division des services du contentieux.\nLe plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e seront inform\u00e9s qu\u2019ils recevront du Tribunal de plus amples renseignements sur cette instance.\n\u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, cette lettre n\u2019imposait aucune limite \u00e0 l\u2019instruction, relativement aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas sollicit\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision par laquelle la Commission a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on instruise la plainte.\n[16] Au d\u00e9but de l\u2019instance devant le Tribunal, les parties ont convenu de faire une tentative de m\u00e9diation. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 4 octobre 2011, le Tribunal a avis\u00e9 les parties qu\u2019une s\u00e9ance de m\u00e9diation \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue pour le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2011, et que les m\u00e9moires connexes devaient \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au plus tard le 15 novembre 2011. Dans cette m\u00eame lettre, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli un calendrier de divulgation de documents au cas o\u00f9 la m\u00e9diation n\u2019aboutirait pas \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement.\n[17] Le 2 d\u00e9cembre 2011, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le dossier, le membre du Tribunal d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de reporter la m\u00e9diation et a donn\u00e9 instruction aux parties de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la divulgation de documents. Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 6 d\u00e9cembre 2011 en vue de pr\u00e9ciser les prochaines \u00e9tapes et de traiter de tout probl\u00e8me de divulgation ou d\u2019autres questions pr\u00e9liminaires. Cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e.\n[18] Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2011, la Commission a demand\u00e9 par lettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire certains documents.\n[19] Le 10 janvier 2012, la Commission a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour lui demander de faire le point sur la plainte. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les documents que la Commission devait divulguer \u00e9taient dus le 17 janvier 2012 et que la m\u00e9diation et la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on suspende les d\u00e9lais de divulgation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les parties puissent discuter de l\u2019affaire dans le cadre d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. En r\u00e9ponse, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la m\u00e9diation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e, le calendrier de divulgation ne s\u2019appliquait plus. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 aux parties de faire part de leurs disponibilit\u00e9s en pr\u00e9vision d\u2019une prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[20] Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique a eu lieu avec les parties le 23 janvier 2012 et, \u00e0 cette occasion, les parties et le Tribunal ont convenu de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation.\n[21] La m\u00e9diation a eu lieu le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012, mais elle ne s\u2019est pas sold\u00e9e par un r\u00e8glement. Le Tribunal a tenu le m\u00eame jour une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance avec les parties. Lors de cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, la Commission a fait savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa lettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dat\u00e9e du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2011, demandant la production de certains documents. De plus, lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire certains documents. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de donner une r\u00e9ponse au plaignant ainsi que de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de production de documents de la Commission d\u2019ici le 7 mars 2012.\n[22] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande de documents de la Commission et du plaignant le 7 mars 2012. Elle a notamment exprim\u00e9 l\u2019avis que la demande de documents \u00e9tait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas encore eu \u00e9change d\u2019expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et que certains des documents demand\u00e9s ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, L.C. 1995, ch. 44 (la LEE).\n[23] Le plaignant et la Commission ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser des requ\u00eates en vue d\u2019obtenir les documents qu\u2019ils avaient ant\u00e9rieurement demand\u00e9s. En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle d\u00e9poserait une requ\u00eate portant sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte et sur la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Un calendrier relatif au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019observations \u00e9crites sur les trois requ\u00eates a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli. Les observations \u00e9crites concernant les trois requ\u00eates devaient \u00eatre produites d\u2019ici le 23 juillet 2012.\n[24] Le Tribunal a tenu une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance le 18 juillet 2012, au cours de laquelle il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il entendrait les observations orales des parties au sujet des requ\u00eates. Une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e aux 15 et 16 octobre 2012, \u00e0 Ottawa.\n[25] Commen\u00e7ant par la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal a entendu les observations orales des parties les 15 et 16 octobre 2012 \u00e0 Ottawa, relativement aux trois requ\u00eates. L\u2019audience a pris fin le 17 octobre 2012, par la voie d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\nB. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la LRTFP [26] Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2007, le plaignant et sept autres personnes ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief collectif contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 215 de la LRTFP. Ce grief collectif portait notamment sur les actes, les politiques et les pratiques actuelles et ant\u00e9rieures de la direction de la CISR qui ont pour effet d\u2019exercer une discrimination pr\u00e9judiciable, de priver de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi et d\u2019avantages sociaux et de cr\u00e9er et de favoriser des obstacles en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019agents pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux cas et membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible qui travaillent au sein de la Section d\u2019appel de l\u2019immigration, dans la r\u00e9gion de Toronto de la CISR. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le grief mettait en cause des questions vis\u00e9es par la Loi, la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de ce dernier.\n[27] La Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique (la CRTFP) a entendu le grief collectif du plaignant les 27 et 28 septembre 2012. La Commission n\u2019a pas pris part \u00e0 cette instance.\nC. La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la LEFP [28] Le 21 mars 2007, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique (le TDFP) en vertu de l\u2019article 77 de la LEFP. Dans la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le choix de la CISR de recourir \u00e0 un processus de nomination non annonc\u00e9 en vue de doter en personnel de nouveaux postes de niveau PM\u201105 \u00e9tait discriminatoire envers le plaignant du fait de sa race. Il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans cette plainte que le processus non annonc\u00e9 constituait un cas de discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans lequel les obstacles \u00e0 l\u2019emploi donnaient lieu \u00e0 une surconcentration de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles dans les postes d\u2019agent pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux cas, au sein du groupe-niveau PM\u201101.\n[29] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009, le TDFP a rejet\u00e9 la plainte du plaignant (Murray c. Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9, 2009 TDFP 33 [Murray]). Il a statu\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Il a conclu que, m\u00eame si le plaignant l\u2019avait fait, la CISR s\u2019\u00e9tait acquitt\u00e9e de son fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir une explication non discriminatoire raisonnable pour avoir choisi entre un processus de nomination annonc\u00e9 et non annonc\u00e9. Une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant la d\u00e9cision du TDFP a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[30] Le 11 mai 2011, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a fait droit \u00e0 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire du plaignant concernant la d\u00e9cision du TDFP (Murray c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CF 542). Elle a conclu que le TDFP avait viol\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale du plaignant en ne tenant pas compte de la demande de ce dernier de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience. Elle a ordonn\u00e9 au TDFP d\u2019examiner la pertinence des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il les accepterait et, si oui, quel en serait l\u2019effet sur le fond de la plainte.\n[31] Le 30 novembre 2011, le TDFP a rejet\u00e9 la demande du plaignant au sujet de la production d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience (Murray c. Pr\u00e9sident de la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9, 2011 TDFP 36). Le TDFP a rejet\u00e9 la plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses motifs dat\u00e9s du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2009. Une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant la d\u00e9cision que le TDFP a rendue en 2011 est actuellement en instance devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (no du greffe T\u2011372\u201112).\nIII. Les questions en litige [32] La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de faire rejeter la plainte soul\u00e8ve les questions suivantes aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal :\nA. Pour quel motif le Tribunal peut-il rejeter une plainte avant de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond?\nB. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi restreint-il la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte?\nC. Le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi restreint-il la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte?\nD. Y a-t-il lieu de rejeter la plainte d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure?\nE. Subsidiairement, si la plainte n\u2019est pas rejet\u00e9e pour l\u2019un des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, y a\u2011t\u2011il lieu de restreindre la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction?\n[33] Si la plainte n\u2019est pas rejet\u00e9e suivant l\u2019examen des questions qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal traitera donc des questions suivantes, lesquelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans les requ\u00eates du plaignant et de la Commission concernant la production de documents :\nF. La LEE restreint-elle le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la production de documents?\nG. Les requ\u00eates en production de documents sont-elles pr\u00e9matur\u00e9es?\nH. L\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait-elle produire les documents que demande le plaignant?\nI. L\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait-elle produire les documents que demande la Commission?\nIV. L\u2019analyse A. Pour quel motif le Tribunal peut-il rejeter une plainte avant de tenir une audience compl\u00e8te sur le fond? [34] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment aux articles 48.9 et 50 de la Loi, le Tribunal jouit d\u2019un vaste pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter une plainte \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire. Elle soutient que les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate en rejet n\u2019ont pas trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si la Commission a commis une erreur, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 celle de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence sur le fond de la plainte et si le fait de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction compl\u00e8te constituerait un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Elle ajoute que le fait de porter ces pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l\u2019attention du Tribunal dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire est le moyen appropri\u00e9 et le plus efficace de les examiner.\n[35] Le plaignant et la Commission conviennent que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, mais ils sont d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y a lieu de le faire avec prudence. Selon la Commission, la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas du genre de celles que le Tribunal devrait rejeter \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire, car elle met en cause une s\u00e9rie complexe de faits et soul\u00e8ve d\u2019importantes questions de droit, dont d\u2019importantes questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. La Commission fait remarquer que les parties n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions, ni fourni une preuve quelconque qui aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer quelles sont les questions de droit et de fait importantes qui sont soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Le plaignant ajoute que le Tribunal ne peut pas examiner des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission qui auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es par une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour.\n[36] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9cemment examin\u00e9 le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal de rejeter une plainte avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction compl\u00e8te sur le fond : Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445 [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada]. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, rien dans la Loi ou dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal n\u2019emp\u00eache de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate pour que le Tribunal tranche une question importante avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction compl\u00e8te de la plainte sur le fond. Il n\u2019y a rien non plus dans la Loi ou dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal qui emp\u00eacherait ce dernier de trancher une telle requ\u00eate. Cependant, conform\u00e9ment aux articles 48.9 et 50 de la Loi, pour pouvoir entendre et trancher la requ\u00eate il faut que le processus suivi soit \u00e9quitable et que les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle soient respect\u00e9es, les parties ayant la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de produire les preuves qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour trancher les questions que soul\u00e8ve la requ\u00eate (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, aux paragraphes 131 et 132).\n[37] Cependant, lorsqu\u2019il entend des requ\u00eates de cette nature, le Tribunal se doit de respecter les r\u00f4les distincts que jouent la Commission et le Tribunal. Selon le r\u00e9gime \u00e9tabli par la Loi, la Commission est l\u2019organisme qui accepte, g\u00e8re et traite les plaintes de pratiques discriminatoires. Aux termes du paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi, la Commission peut demander au Tribunal d\u2019instruire une plainte si elle est convaincue que, compte tenu de toutes circonstances connexes, une telle mesure est justifi\u00e9e. La d\u00e9cision que prend la Commission de renvoyer la plainte ne revient pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider que la plainte est fond\u00e9e, ni m\u00eame qu\u2019elle tombe sous le coup de la Loi. Il n\u2019appartient pas non plus au Tribunal de se demander si la Commission a conclu de mani\u00e8re raisonnable qu\u2019une instruction est justifi\u00e9e. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du r\u00f4le de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (voir Deborah P. Labelle c. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 71; International Longshore & Warehouse Union (Maritime Section), section locale 400 c. Oster, [2002] 2 CF 430, aux paragraphes 29 et 30; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Warman, 2012 CF 1162, aux paragraphes 55 \u00e0 57; et Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission), 2012 CSC 10, aux paragraphes 23, 27 et 33). Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 instruire la plainte (voir les paragraphes 49(2) et 50(1) de la Loi). Pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction qui est nouvelle, par suite de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et peut d\u00e9cider quelle est la meilleure fa\u00e7on d\u2019examiner les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es, dont le rejet de la plainte avant une instruction compl\u00e8te sur le fond (voir Prassad c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1989] 1 RCS 560, au paragraphe 16; et Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81, au paragraphe 14, conf. par 2004 CAF 363 [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes]).\n[38] Cela dit, le Tribunal exerce de mani\u00e8re prudente son pouvoir de rejeter une plainte relative aux droits de la personne avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction compl\u00e8te et, alors, mais seulement alors, dans les cas les plus manifestes (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, au paragraphe 140; et Buffett c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 39). Il peut y avoir des cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment obligatoire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction compl\u00e8te comprenant des t\u00e9moignages de vive voix mais, dans d\u2019autres situations, o\u00f9 les questions de fait et de droit sont complexes et entrem\u00eal\u00e9es, il peut \u00eatre nettement plus efficace d\u2019attendre l\u2019instruction compl\u00e8te avant de se prononcer sur la question pr\u00e9liminaire (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, aux paragraphes 141 \u00e0 144). Dans tous les cas, \u00ab le Tribunal doit examiner les faits et les questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre dans le but de garantir un processus d\u2019audience aussi informel et rapide que le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure le permet \u00bb (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, au paragraphe 148).\n[39] C\u2019est en me fondant sur cette interpr\u00e9tation du pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal de rejeter une plainte avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction compl\u00e8te sur le fond que j\u2019examinerai les questions que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve dans sa requ\u00eate en rejet.\nB. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi restreint-il la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte? [40] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en 1995 le l\u00e9gislateur a apport\u00e9 des modifications \u00e0 la LEE et, en m\u00eame temps, des modifications corr\u00e9latives \u00e0 la Loi. Ces derni\u00e8res ont retir\u00e9 au Tribunal la comp\u00e9tence sur les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la sous-repr\u00e9sentation de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cette mesure garantit que l\u2019approche coop\u00e9rative et concert\u00e9e permettant de r\u00e9aliser l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qui se situe au c\u0153ur m\u00eame du r\u00e9gime de la LEE n\u2019est pas mise en p\u00e9ril par des plaintes que des tiers d\u00e9posent au Tribunal. En particulier, elle attire l\u2019attention sur l\u2019article 40.1 de la Loi qui, \u00e0 son avis, exclut les plaintes fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les membres d\u2019un groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sont sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur. Elle soutient qu\u2019il ressort clairement du formulaire de plainte, des rapports d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, de l\u2019ordonnance de la juge Hansen ainsi que des d\u00e9cisions que la Commission a rendues le 20 octobre 2008 et le 29 juillet 2011 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal sont exclusivement ax\u00e9s sur des all\u00e9gations de surconcentration des minorit\u00e9s visibles aux \u00e9chelons inf\u00e9rieurs ainsi que de sous-repr\u00e9sentation des minorit\u00e9s visibles aux \u00e9chelons sup\u00e9rieurs de certaines classifications au Bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de la CISR durant les douze mois qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Cette derni\u00e8re ne fait pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une pratique ou d\u2019une politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui causerait cens\u00e9ment de la discrimination en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, comme la plainte est uniquement fond\u00e9e sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui visent \u00e0 montrer que les membres d\u2019un groupe d\u00e9sign\u00e9 sont sous\u2011repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au sein de l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une plainte valable en vertu de la Loi, aux termes de l\u2019article 40.1 et, de ce fait, elle exc\u00e8de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal.\n[41] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques et d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve est parfaitement admissible. Selon lui, c\u2019est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u00e0 la nature de la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, laquelle est \u00e9galement \u00e9tay\u00e9e par diverses autres preuves directes et circonstancielles.\n[42] Selon la Commission, l\u2019article 40.1 de la Loi s\u2019applique exclusivement \u00e0 la Commission, et non au Tribunal. Elle soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, par ses arguments, ne tient pas compte des r\u00f4les distincts que jouent la Commission et le Tribunal sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une contestation implicite de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission, elle aurait pu demander un contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant le tribunal appropri\u00e9 : la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire.\n[43] Le texte du paragraphe 40.1(2) de la Loi est le suivant :\nException \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence\n(2) La Commission ne peut se fonder sur l\u2019article 40 pour conna\u00eetre des plaintes qui, \u00e0 la fois, sont :\na) faites contre un employeur et d\u00e9non\u00e7ant la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019actes discriminatoires vis\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 ou \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a);\nb) fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur.\n[44] Vu le libell\u00e9 explicite du paragraphe 40.1(2), le Tribunal ne conteste pas l\u2019affirmation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 7 et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a), qui reposent exclusivement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur, ne doivent pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9es par la Commission en tant que plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le paragraphe 40(3.1) de la Loi emp\u00eache la Commission de prendre l\u2019initiative d\u2019une plainte qui serait fond\u00e9e sur des renseignements obtenus dans le cadre de l\u2019application de la LEE. Je signale \u00e9galement le paragraphe 41(2) de la Loi, qui autorise la Commission \u00e0 refuser d\u2019examiner une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) si elle estime que son objet est trait\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate dans le plan d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi que l\u2019employeur pr\u00e9pare en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019article 10 de la LEE. Le paragraphe 40(3.1), l\u2019article 40.1 et le paragraphe 41(2) de la Loi concordent avec la responsabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019a la Commission de faire respecter les obligations qu\u2019impose la LEE aux employeurs par voie d\u2019un \u00ab [\u2026] r\u00e8glement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 en vue de l\u2019obtention d\u2019un engagement [\u2026] \u00bb (voir les paragraphes 22(1) et 22(2) de la LEE). Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le l\u00e9gislateur a opt\u00e9 pour une approche coop\u00e9rative et concert\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, au lieu de trancher de telles plaintes sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi.\n[45] Cela dit, le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 40.1(2) de la Loi ne fait mention que de la Commission : \u00ab La Commission ne peut se fonder sur l\u2019article 40 pour conna\u00eetre des plaintes [\u2026] \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 dans ce paragraphe car, quand on examine l\u2019esprit de la Loi, il est clair que les articles 40 \u00e0 46 de cette derni\u00e8re concernent exclusivement le r\u00f4le que joue la Commission pour ce qui est de recevoir et de traiter les plaintes vis\u00e9es par la Loi. Le Tribunal n\u2019intervient nullement dans une plainte avant que la Commission soit convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 celles-ci, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e et demande au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, une fois qu\u2019une instruction est demand\u00e9e, il incombe au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte, et non pas de mettre en doute si la Commission a conclu de fa\u00e7on raisonnable qu\u2019une instruction est justifi\u00e9e (voir les paragraphes 49(2) et 50(1) de la Loi).\n[46] Outre le fait que le paragraphe 40.1(2) s\u2019applique strictement \u00e0 la Commission, je signale que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) a trait aux plaintes : \u00ab [\u2026] fond\u00e9es uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques [\u2026] \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). Cela donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7 ou sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi peut \u00eatre \u00e9tay\u00e9e par des donn\u00e9es statistiques \u00e9tablissant l\u2019existence d\u2019une sous-repr\u00e9sentation, mais qu\u2019il ne peut pas s\u2019agir du seul fondement. En effet, les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur ces deux dispositions sont ax\u00e9es sur les pratiques discriminatoires qui y sont expos\u00e9es, et non sur une sous-repr\u00e9sentation en tant que telle. Cependant, des preuves statistiques de sous-repr\u00e9sentation peuvent \u00eatre utiles dans les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne et peuvent constituer une preuve circonstancielle d\u2019o\u00f9 il est possible de tirer des inf\u00e9rences quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une conduite discriminatoire (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490, au paragraphe 114; Khiamal c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495, aux paragraphes 89 \u00e0 102; et Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), 1998 CanLII 7740 (CF), aux paragraphes 10 \u00e0 22).\n[47] Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire concernant la d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 20 octobre 2008 de la Commission de rejeter la plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a consenti \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on renvoie \u00e0 la Commission la question de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en vue de la tenue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate suppl\u00e9mentaire. Dans la d\u00e9cision du 18 ao\u00fbt 2009, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne fait pas \u00e9tat d\u2019une question relative \u00e0 l\u2019article 40.1. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019en a pas non plus fait \u00e9tat lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate suppl\u00e9mentaire de la Commission. \u00c0 la suite de cette enqu\u00eate, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019on instruise la plainte de M. Murray car elle s\u2019est dite convaincue que cette mesure \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la plainte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques concernant une sous-repr\u00e9sentation, elle aurait d\u00fb invoquer l\u2019article 40.1 de la Loi avant l\u2019issue de l\u2019enqu\u00eate suppl\u00e9mentaire de la Commission, soit devant la Commission, soit avant de consentir \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du 18 ao\u00fbt 2009 de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. De plus, si elle ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de demander que l\u2019on instruise la plainte, elle aurait d\u00fb demander que cette d\u00e9cision fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u00e0 encore, elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, il n\u2019est pas loisible \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de demander au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la d\u00e9cision de la Commission.\n[48] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord non plus pour dire que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi restreint maintenant la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus t\u00f4t, l\u2019article 40.1 de la Loi s\u2019applique strictement \u00e0 la Commission et, une fois qu\u2019une instruction est demand\u00e9e, il incombe au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte. \u00c0 mon avis, une fois qu\u2019une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, la question de savoir si la plainte est fond\u00e9e uniquement sur des preuves statistiques doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e au moment de d\u00e9cider si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019instance, avant d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u une preuve quelconque quant au bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte, rien ne permet au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider si la plainte repose uniquement sur des preuves statistiques et, de ce fait, si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie.\n[49] C\u2019est donc dire que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi ne restreint pas la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte.\nC. Le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi restreint-il la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte? [50] \u00c0 l\u2019instar de son argument relatif \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 40.1(2)b) de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019outre les modifications mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus \u00e0 la Loi (paragraphe 40(3.1), article 40.1 et paragraphe 41(2)), l\u2019article 54.1 a lui aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi \u00e0 la suite des modifications apport\u00e9es en 1995 \u00e0 la LEE. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ces modifications ont eu pour effet conjugu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9carter les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi au sujet de la sous-repr\u00e9sentation de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s et d\u2019\u00e9viter le d\u00e9doublement des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la LEE et de la Loi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, l\u2019article 54.1 emp\u00eache le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la mise en \u0153uvre de politiques ou pratiques positives destin\u00e9es \u00e0 corriger la sous-repr\u00e9sentation des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s. L\u00e0 encore, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plainte repose uniquement sur des donn\u00e9es statistiques qui tendent \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les membres d\u2019un ou plusieurs groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s sont sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur, l\u2019article 54.1 interdit au Tribunal d\u2019accorder en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une mesure de redressement concr\u00e8te. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune mesure de redressement concr\u00e8te ne peut \u00eatre ordonn\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal se doit d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et de rejeter la plainte.\n[51] Selon le plaignant, l\u2019article 54.1 de la Loi porte sur le pouvoir de redressement qu\u2019a le Tribunal apr\u00e8s avoir instruit une plainte que la Commission lui a renvoy\u00e9e. Il soutient que cet article emp\u00eache simplement le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la prise de mesures d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qui sont par ailleurs vis\u00e9es par la LEE. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une limite restreinte au pouvoir de redressement dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie le Tribunal, qui ne lui interdit pas par ailleurs d\u2019accorder d\u2019autres mesures de redressement si la plainte est justifi\u00e9e, soit directement au plaignant, soit en vue de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019ordre syst\u00e9mique.\n[52] Selon la Commission, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que fait l\u2019intim\u00e9e de l\u2019article 54.1 ne concorde pas avec le libell\u00e9 explicite de la Loi, car cette disposition n\u2019a pas pour effet de restreindre les pouvoirs de redressement du Tribunal. Lu de pair avec le paragraphe 54.1(3), le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi ne restreint pas le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire ou, sinon, d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier. Comme l\u2019ajoute la Commission, le Tribunal jouit, sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi, de vastes pouvoirs de redressement qui lui permettent de concevoir des solutions originales \u00e0 une discrimination syst\u00e9mique.\n[53] Le texte des paragraphes 54.1(2) et 54.1(3) de la Loi est le suivant :\nRestriction\n(2) Le tribunal qui juge fond\u00e9e une plainte contre un employeur ne peut lui ordonner, malgr\u00e9 le sous-alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i), d\u2019adopter un programme, plan ou arrangement comportant des r\u00e8gles et usages positifs destin\u00e9s \u00e0 corriger la sous\u2011repr\u00e9sentation des membres des groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s dans son effectif ou des objectifs et calendriers \u00e0 cet effet.\nPr\u00e9cision\n(3) Il est entendu que le paragraphe (2) n\u2019a pas pour effet de restreindre le pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au tribunal par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier de toute autre mani\u00e8re.\n[54] Par opposition \u00e0 l\u2019article 40.1, qui vise uniquement la Commission, l\u2019article 54.1 de la Loi s\u2019applique bel et bien au Tribunal. L\u00e0 encore, ce dernier ne conteste pas que l\u2019ajout de cette disposition avait pour but d\u2019\u00e9viter le d\u00e9doublement des m\u00e9canismes d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la LEE et de la Loi. C\u2019est ce qui ressort clairement quand on examine l\u2019article 10 de la LEE, qui oblige les employeurs \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les questions mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi dans le cadre de leurs plans d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi respectifs. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le l\u00e9gislateur a opt\u00e9 pour une approche coop\u00e9rative et concert\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution des questions mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi par la voie d\u2019un : \u00ab [\u2026] r\u00e8glement n\u00e9goci\u00e9 en vue de l\u2019obtention d\u2019un engagement [\u2026] \u00bb entre la Commission et les employeurs sous le r\u00e9gime de la LEE (voir les paragraphes 22(1) et 22(2) de la LEE). Je conviens donc avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le Tribunal ne peut pas rendre une ordonnance obligeant un intim\u00e9 \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre des politiques ou pratiques positives con\u00e7ues pour garantir que les membres de groupes d\u00e9sign\u00e9s soient davantage repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans l\u2019effectif de l\u2019employeur. Le Tribunal ne peut pas non plus rendre une ordonnance qui fixe des buts et des calendriers en vue d\u2019atteindre cette repr\u00e9sentation sup\u00e9rieure.\n[55] Cela dit, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire que les limites pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es au paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi restreignent la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce une mesure de redressement concr\u00e8te. Le paragraphe 54.1(3) pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment que le paragraphe 54.1(2) ne restreint pas le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 un employeur de mettre fin \u00e0 un acte discriminatoire ou d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier de toute autre mani\u00e8re aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, je signale que, malgr\u00e9 les limites que comporte le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi, le sous-alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)(i) autorise tout de m\u00eame le Tribunal \u00e0 ordonner \u00e0 un employeur d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement sp\u00e9ciaux destin\u00e9s \u00e0 supprimer, diminuer ou pr\u00e9venir les d\u00e9savantages que subit un groupe d\u2019individus. De plus, le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi ne limite pas par ailleurs le pouvoir qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner la prise de l\u2019une quelconque des autres mesures de redressement qui figurent aux alin\u00e9as 53(2)b) \u00e0 53(2)e) ou aux paragraphes 53(3) et 53(4) de la Loi.\n[56] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord non plus pour dire que l\u2019indisponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une mesure de redressement concr\u00e8te peut servir de motif pour rejeter une plainte. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je note le libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi : \u00ab [\u00e0] l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, [\u2026] ordonner [\u2026] \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original). Le libell\u00e9 de ce paragraphe semble indiquer que le pouvoir de redressement du Tribunal n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une instruction, une fois qu\u2019une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 fond\u00e9e. De ce fait, la Loi ne semble pas autoriser le Tribunal \u00e0 rejeter une plainte \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire au motif qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de mesures de redressement concr\u00e8tes. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sume \u00e9galement que le Tribunal est oblig\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner une mesure de redressement. L\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab peut \u00bb au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi donne \u00e0 penser que le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rendre une ordonnance, ou pas. Dans certaines circonstances, m\u00eame si une plainte est fond\u00e9e, il peut \u00eatre appropri\u00e9 que le Tribunal ne rende pas d\u2019ordonnance. Dans chaque cas, le Tribunal exercera son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement en tenant compte des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire, ainsi que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[57] En cons\u00e9quence, le paragraphe 54.1(2) de la Loi ne restreint pas la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nD. Y a-t-il lieu de rejeter la plainte d\u2019apr\u00e8s les principes de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure? [58] Invoquant l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52 [Figliola] de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, ainsi que l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Office des transports du Canada, 2011 CAF 332 [Morten] de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le Tribunal devrait exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour rejeter la plainte \u00e0 cause du principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Selon elle, l\u2019employeur, des consultants externes ainsi que la Commission ont fait enqu\u00eate sur les questions de surconcentration et de sous-repr\u00e9sentation, tant au sein de l\u2019effectif global qu\u2019au sein des postes int\u00e9rimaires et permanents au bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto de la CISR. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ajoute que ces questions ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par le TDFP et sont cens\u00e9es \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 la CRTFP.\n[59] En ce qui concerne pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les instances devant le TDFP, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis que la plainte relative aux droits de la personne met en cause les m\u00eames faits et les m\u00eames questions. De plus, la Commission a eu l\u2019occasion de participer \u00e0 l\u2019instance devant le TDFP, mais elle a refus\u00e9 de le faire. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le TDFP a conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 instruire les plaintes d\u2019abus de pouvoir dans lesquelles on all\u00e8gue l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination syst\u00e9mique et \u00e0 autoriser le plaignant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 de la preuve, le TDFP a conclu que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination et il a rejet\u00e9 sa plainte. Comme l\u2019ajoute l\u2019intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision du TDFP ne porte que sur la classification du groupe PM (plut\u00f4t que sur celle des PM, CR, AS et LA dont il est maintenant question dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte relative aux droits de la personne), il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019un argument qui permet de consid\u00e9rer que les instances devant le TDFP et le Tribunal sont diff\u00e9rentes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient plut\u00f4t qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un autre moyen de faire valoir que la ligne de conduite que le plaignant a adopt\u00e9e est un abus de proc\u00e9dure, car il a maintenant \u00e9largi la port\u00e9e de la plainte de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 englober plusieurs autres classifications.\n[60] Le plaignant soutient que les principes de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e et de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure ne s\u2019appliquent pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon lui, la question de savoir si, ou dans quelle mesure, l\u2019employeur ou toute personne agissant en son nom a fait enqu\u00eate sur un aspect quelconque de la plainte actuellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal ne fait aucune diff\u00e9rence. Le Tribunal n\u2019est li\u00e9 par aucune des conclusions que l\u2019employeur a tir\u00e9es au sujet des questions qui tombent sous le coup de la plainte. Par ailleurs, le plaignant soutient que les rapports d\u2019enqu\u00eate que la Commission a \u00e9tablis ne sont pas des d\u00e9cisions de cette derni\u00e8re, et que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par eux. L\u2019affaire soumise au Tribunal est nouvelle, et les conclusions ou les recommandations des enqu\u00eateurs ne s\u2019appliquent pas au fond de la plainte. Pour ce qui est du grief collectif d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la CRTFP, le plaignant soutient que l\u2019affaire n\u2019est pas pertinente. Les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola et le principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e exigent que l\u2019on ait tranch\u00e9 la m\u00eame question et que la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure soit d\u00e9finitive. Au moment o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, la CRTFP n\u2019avait pas encore instruit le grief ni rendu une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive. Le plaignant ajoute \u00e9galement que la partie intim\u00e9e dans le grief collectif est le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, et non la CISR.\n[61] Pour ce qui est de la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend que ce dernier n\u2019a trait\u00e9 que de la question de savoir si la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019employeur d\u2019opter pour un processus de nomination non annonc\u00e9 en vue d\u2019un poste de bureau de niveau PM\u201105 \u00e9tait entach\u00e9e par une discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Selon lui, le TDFP n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de faire enqu\u00eate sur des questions de discrimination de plus grande envergure qui d\u00e9bordent le cadre d\u2019un processus de nomination particulier, pas plus qu\u2019il ne peut rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 des questions de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. En cons\u00e9quence, le TDFP n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 \u2013 et ne pouvait pas examiner \u2013 d\u2019autres questions relev\u00e9es dans la plainte relative aux droits de la personne dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le plaignant ajoute qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 22 avril 2004, elle ne pouvait pas contenir des all\u00e9gations concernant un processus de nomination qui avait eu lieu au moins deux ann\u00e9es plus tard. De plus, le TDFP n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les pr\u00e9occupations de nature plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon lesquelles, \u00e0 cause de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique exerc\u00e9e \u00e0 la CISR, il \u00e9tait priv\u00e9 de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi et soumis \u00e0 une conduite discriminatoire, dont du harc\u00e8lement, qui l\u2019emp\u00eachait d\u2019accomplir son travail. Le plaignant soutient donc que l\u2019on ne peut pas dire que la question que le TDFP a tranch\u00e9e \u00e9tait essentiellement la m\u00eame que celles dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[62] Selon la Commission, les enqu\u00eates que l\u2019employeur a men\u00e9es sont de nature interne, distinctes de toute d\u00e9cision que rendra le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal et li\u00e9es \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement, une question dont le Tribunal n\u2019est pas saisi. La Commission ajoute que les consultants externes auxquels fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 des conclusions d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une v\u00e9rification relative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi, dans laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu\u2019il y avait surconcentration de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles au niveau PM\u201101.\n[63] En ce qui concerne la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP, la Commission soutient que celle dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne soul\u00e8ve pas les m\u00eames questions. Selon elle, il ressort d\u2019un examen de la d\u00e9cision que le TDFP a rendue que les questions de discrimination syst\u00e9mique invoqu\u00e9es \u00e9taient accessoires \u00e0 la question de fond examin\u00e9e, soit la question de savoir s\u2019il y avait eu abus de pouvoir, aux termes de l\u2019article 77 de la LEFP, dans la d\u00e9cision de la CISR de pourvoir de nouveaux postes PM\u201105 en recourant \u00e0 un processus non annonc\u00e9. Selon la Commission, dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la question est diff\u00e9rente, soit la question de savoir si la discrimination syst\u00e9mique qu\u2019exerce l\u2019intim\u00e9e prive le plaignant et d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi du fait de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique. La Commission ajoute que les questions de droit et de fait qui sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte sont distinctes de celles dont il est question dans les arr\u00eats Figliola et Morten. Dans ces deux affaires, les plaignants avaient d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de court-circuiter le processus d\u2019appel dont ils disposaient et de d\u00e9poser en m\u00eame temps une plainte relative aux droits de la personne distincte. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, le plaignant n\u2019a pas court-circuit\u00e9 le processus d\u2019appel devant un tribunal quelconque.\n[64] Par ailleurs, la Commission soutient que le Human Rights Code de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif dans le cadre duquel a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, diff\u00e8re nettement de celui de la Loi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle attire l\u2019attention sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 27(1)f) du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique, qui permet au BC Human Rights Tribunal de rejeter une plainte dont le fond a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e dans le cadre d\u2019une autre instance. Le Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario comporte, \u00e0 l\u2019article 45.1, une disposition analogue. Selon la Commission, la Loi n\u2019envisage pas une disposition comparable \u00e0 celles que l\u2019on retrouve en Colombie-Britannique et en Ontario. La Commission indique que m\u00eame si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)b) de la Loi permet \u00e0 la Commission de ne pas instruire une plainte qui pourrait \u00eatre instruite avantageusement selon des proc\u00e9dures pr\u00e9vues par une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cette disposition traite express\u00e9ment de la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission, et non de celle du Tribunal. De ce fait, m\u00eame si les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola s\u2019appliquent aux d\u00e9cideurs administratifs en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il est n\u00e9cessaire dans chaque cas de tenir compte du contexte dans lequel s\u2019inscrit la loi applicable.\n[65] Les principes de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure et de la contestation indirecte \u00ab existent essentiellement pour pr\u00e9venir l\u2019in\u00e9quit\u00e9 en emp\u00eachant \u201cles recours abusifs\u201d \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 34). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, les juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ont r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les aspects ordinaires qui sous-tendent ces principes :\n\u2022 La capacit\u00e9 de se fier au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sert l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et celui des parties.\n\u2022 Le respect du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative renforce l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 ou l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des tribunaux judiciaires et administratifs ainsi que de l\u2019administration de la justice; \u00e0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9, la remise en cause de questions d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9es par un forum comp\u00e9tent peut miner la confiance envers l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me en cr\u00e9ant de l\u2019incoh\u00e9rence et en suscitant des recours faisant inutilement double emploi.\n\u2022 La contestation de la validit\u00e9 ou du bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative se fait au moyen de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9vue par le l\u00e9gislateur.\n\u2022 Les parties ne doivent pas \u00e9luder le m\u00e9canisme de r\u00e9vision pr\u00e9vu en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 un autre forum pour contester une d\u00e9cision judiciaire ou administrative.\n\u2022 En \u00e9vitant les remises en cause inutiles, on \u00e9vite le gaspillage de ressources.\n(Figliola, au paragraphe 34)\n[66] D\u2019apr\u00e8s ces principes, un tribunal statuant sur une demande de ne pas instruire une instance, au motif que le sujet de cette derni\u00e8re a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 par un autre tribunal, devrait se poser les questions suivantes :\n\u2022 s\u2019il existe une comp\u00e9tence concurrente pour statuer sur les questions relatives aux droits de la personne;\n\u2022 si la question juridique tranch\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure \u00e9tait essentiellement la m\u00eame que celle qui est soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte dont il est saisi;\n\u2022 si le processus ant\u00e9rieur, qu\u2019il ressemble ou non \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure que le tribunal pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ou utilise lui-m\u00eame, a offert la possibilit\u00e9 aux plaignants ou \u00e0 leurs ayants droit de conna\u00eetre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments invoqu\u00e9s contre eux et de les r\u00e9futer.\n(voir Figliola, au paragraphe 37)\nSelon les juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada : \u00ab [i]l s\u2019agit, en d\u00e9finitive, de se demander s\u2019il est logique de consacrer des ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es \u00e0 la remise en cause de ce qui est essentiellement le m\u00eame litige \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 37).\n[67] Pour examiner la question du principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que le Tribunal doit uniquement se pr\u00e9occuper du r\u00e9sultat auquel a pu arriver la d\u00e9cision du TDFP. Toute enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou ses consultants externes importe peu. Ni l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ni ses consultants externes n\u2019avaient la comp\u00e9tence l\u00e9gale pour trancher les questions relatives aux droits de la personne. Cela s\u2019applique \u00e9galement aux enqu\u00eates de la Commission. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, lorsqu\u2019elle a affaire \u00e0 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, la Commission a pour r\u00f4le de recevoir et de traiter les plaintes. Elle d\u00e9cide uniquement s\u2019il est justifi\u00e9 ou non que le Tribunal instruise la plainte. L\u2019enqu\u00eate que m\u00e8ne la Commission et la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle rend ne tranchent pas le fond des questions relatives aux droits de la personne qui se pr\u00e9sentent dans une affaire donn\u00e9e. Ce r\u00f4le-l\u00e0 incombe au Tribunal sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi : instruire les plaintes que lui renvoie la Commission (voir le paragraphe 49(2) et l\u2019article 50 de la Loi).\n[68] Pour ce qui est du grief collectif d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en vertu de la LRTFP, la CRTFP n\u2019a pas rendu de d\u00e9cision au sujet de la plainte. M\u00eame si la CRTFP peut avoir comp\u00e9tence concurrente pour trancher des questions relatives aux droits de la personne, il n\u2019y a aucune \u00ab question de droit d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e \u00bb \u00e0 proprement parler.\n[69] Examinant la d\u00e9cision du TDFP, la Commission fait valoir qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal tienne compte du contexte du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif dans le cadre duquel la d\u00e9cision Figliola a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue et en quoi le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif diff\u00e8re de la Loi. Cependant, je conclus que cela n\u2019a aucune incidence sur l\u2019affaire qui nous occupe ici. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, les juges majoritaires de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 27(1)f) du Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique refl\u00e8te les principes de common law que sont l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure et la contestation indirecte (voir le paragraphe 25). Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ces juges ont mentionn\u00e9 :\n[\u2026] l\u2019al. 27(1)f) refl\u00e8te l\u2019ensemble des principes sous-jacents de ces r\u00e8gles, auxquelles la common law a eu recours comme v\u00e9hicule pour porter, en contexte de proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, les principes de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances, de pr\u00e9vention de leur multiplication et de protection de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice, dans chaque cas, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9.\n(Figliola, au paragraphe 25, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[70] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morten, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que les commentaires de la Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9taient fort pertinents pour \u00ab l\u2019application de ces principes de common law par le Tribunal \u00bb (au paragraphe 24). En appliquant ces principes \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que le Tribunal avait rendue dans cette affaire, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal \u00ab n\u2019[avait] pas proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019analyse requise \u00bb (au paragraphe 28). Cette analyse obligeait le Tribunal \u00e0 tenir compte de \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019in\u00e9quit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente au magasinage de forum \u00bb (Morten, au paragraphe 28, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original).\n[71] Vu les commentaires des deux cours dans les arr\u00eats Figliola et Morten, je ne vois pas en quoi le r\u00e9gime de la Loi, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)b), a une incidence sur l\u2019analyse fond\u00e9e sur le principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)b) ne s\u2019applique qu\u2019\u00e0 la Commission, dans le cadre du r\u00f4le de v\u00e9rification et d\u2019enqu\u00eate qu\u2019elle m\u00e8ne en vertu de la Loi. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit plus t\u00f4t, une fois que la plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction, l\u2019instance est nouvelle. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada a mentionn\u00e9 : \u00ab [r]ien dans la Loi ou dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure [qui restreigne] le type de requ\u00eates qui peu[t] \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant le Tribunal \u00bb (au paragraphe 131), et a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment reconnu que le Tribunal peut trancher une question d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure avant de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction compl\u00e8te de la plainte sur le fond (aux paragraphes 133 \u00e0 139). C\u2019est donc dire que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)b) de la Loi n\u2019a pas d\u2019incidence sur la capacit\u00e9 qu\u2019a le Tribunal d\u2019examiner les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en common law. En examinant dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate la question du principe de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal ne met pas en doute la d\u00e9cision que prend la Commission de statuer sur la plainte ou de demander une instruction; comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans les arr\u00eats Figliola et Morten, le Tribunal veille plut\u00f4t \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la nouvelle instance dont il est saisi. Ainsi que l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, \u00ab on ne peut affirmer que le Tribunal est \u201cma\u00eetre chez lui\u201d s\u2019il ne peut pr\u00e9munir sa propre proc\u00e9dure contre les abus \u00bb (au paragraphe 15).\n[72] Passons ensuite \u00e0 l\u2019application des principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que le TDFP a rendue; la premi\u00e8re question consiste \u00e0 savoir si le TDFP a comp\u00e9tence concurrente pour trancher des questions relatives aux droits de la personne. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, se fondant sur la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle avait rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tranchemontagne c. Ontario (Directeur du Programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es), 2006 CSC 14, la majorit\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab en l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition expresse \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, tous les tribunaux administratifs ont une comp\u00e9tence concurrente en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application des mesures l\u00e9gislatives relatives aux droits de la personne \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 45). La plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 77 de la LEFP (voir Murray, au paragraphe 4). Pour ce qui est de d\u00e9cider si une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 77 est fond\u00e9e, l\u2019article 80 de la LEFP dispose que le TDFP \u00ab [\u2026] peut interpr\u00e9ter et appliquer la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, sauf les dispositions de celle-ci sur le droit \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. \u00bb Devant le TDFP, le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le choix de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de recourir \u00e0 un processus de nomination non annonc\u00e9 pour pourvoir de nouveaux postes PM\u201105 \u00e9tait un geste discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard du fait de sa race. Il a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que ce processus non annonc\u00e9 constituait un cas de discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans le cadre duquel des obstacles \u00e0 l\u2019emploi menaient \u00e0 une surconcentration de membres des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein de postes d\u2019agent pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux cas, et ce, au groupe et niveau PM\u201101 (voir Murray, au paragraphe 1). Ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019obligeaient pas le TDFP \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter ou \u00e0 appliquer les dispositions de la Loi se rapportant au droit \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale pour l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. De ce fait, le TDFP avait express\u00e9ment comp\u00e9tence pour trancher les questions relatives aux droits de la personne qui \u00e9taient all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans la plainte fond\u00e9e sur la LEFP.\n[73] La deuxi\u00e8me question consiste \u00e0 savoir si la question de droit d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e \u00e9tait essentiellement la m\u00eame que celle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, la question pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP consistait \u00e0 savoir si le choix de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 un processus de nomination non annonc\u00e9 pour pourvoir de nouveaux postes PM\u201105 \u00e9tait un acte discriminatoire contre le plaignant du fait de sa race. Pour justifier son all\u00e9gation, le plaignant n\u2019a pas produit de preuves directes de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, mais a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des preuves circonstancielles de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 la CISR. En analysant cette preuve, le TDFP a tenu pour acquis que \u00ab [l]es \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doivent d\u2019abord permettre d\u2019\u00e9tablir la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques, et ensuite, un lien entre la preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et la preuve de discrimination individuelle fond\u00e9e sur la race \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant \u00bb (Murray, au paragraphe 103). Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les preuves circonstancielles du plaignant, le TDFP a conclu : \u00ab le plaignant n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve circonstancielle suffisante pour appuyer son all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00bb (Murray, au paragraphe 99). M\u00eame s\u2019il existait une preuve d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques, le TDFP a \u00e9galement conclu que \u00ab le Tribunal ne dispose pas d\u2019une preuve suffisante permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une corr\u00e9lation entre les obstacles syst\u00e9miques pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s et la discrimination individuelle \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du plaignant \u00bb (Murray, au paragraphe 103).\n[74] Devant le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal, dans le contexte de la requ\u00eate dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a d\u00e9crit en ces termes sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne : [traduction] \u00ab par suite de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique exerc\u00e9e \u00e0 la CISR, il s\u2019est vu priv\u00e9 de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi et a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une conduite discriminatoire, dont du harc\u00e8lement, qui l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019accomplir son travail \u00bb (au paragraphe 70 de la R\u00e9ponse du plaignant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission d\u00e9crit la plainte en ces termes : [traduction] \u00ab Dans la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, la question a trait \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9matique de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui prive M. Murray et d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi du fait de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique \u00bb (au paragraphe 48 des Observations de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (au sujet de la requ\u00eate en rejet de l\u2019intim\u00e9e)). Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019absence d\u2019expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions exposant les d\u00e9tails des all\u00e9gations du plaignant, la caract\u00e9risation de la plainte, tant par le plaignant que par la Commission, indique clairement que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique au sein de la CISR sont le fondement de la plainte de M. Murray dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi. Cette caract\u00e9risation de la plainte en tant que plainte de \u00ab discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00bb a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 renforc\u00e9e par le plaignant et par la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019audition des pr\u00e9sentes requ\u00eates.\n[75] M\u00eame si les effets pr\u00e9judiciables de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique all\u00e9gu\u00e9e peuvent \u00eatre diff\u00e9rents devant le Tribunal de ce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient devant le TDFP, et cela inclut le nombre des personnes touch\u00e9es, la question sous-jacente demeure la m\u00eame : la CISR a-t-elle agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Murray \u00e0 cause de pratiques syst\u00e9miques all\u00e9gu\u00e9es fond\u00e9es sur la race? Le TDFP a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas assez de preuves pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence, au sein de la CISR, d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques fond\u00e9s sur la race. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, le fait que le TDFP examinait la question de savoir si l\u2019on avait fait preuve de discrimination relativement \u00e0 un processus de nomination unique ne changeait pas la nature de cette conclusion. Le TDFP a d\u2019abord conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas assez de preuves pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques, avant de passer \u00e0 la question de savoir si ces preuves \u00e9tablissaient l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination dans les circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019article 77 de la LEFP. Dans la plainte qui nous occupe ici, le plaignant met de nouveau en cause l\u2019existence d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques fond\u00e9s sur la race au sein de la CISR, et le fait que ces obstacles ont amen\u00e9 la CISR \u00e0 faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Comme le TDFP a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas assez de preuves pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence de tels obstacles au sein de la CISR, je conclus que le TDFP a tranch\u00e9 essentiellement la m\u00eame question de droit que celle dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi.\n[76] La troisi\u00e8me question consiste \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a eu l\u2019occasion de conna\u00eetre la preuve produite contre lui et s\u2019il a eu la chance d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. Devant le TDFP, le plaignant a eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire prima facie en produisant une preuve circonstancielle de l\u2019existence d\u2019obstacles syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 la CISR. Le TDFP a tenu une audience et le plaignant a produit des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sous la forme de rapports portant sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la CISR, de t\u00e9moignages d\u2019experts sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique, ainsi que de t\u00e9moignages de coll\u00e8gues actuels et d\u2019anciens coll\u00e8gues (voir Murray, au paragraphe 87). M\u00eame si la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP avait principalement trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si les pratiques d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la CISR avaient cr\u00e9\u00e9 une concentration [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb d\u2019employ\u00e9s membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible aux \u00e9chelons inf\u00e9rieurs de la CISR \u2013 ce qui est aussi l\u2019un des obstacles syst\u00e9miques relev\u00e9s par le plaignant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2013, rien n\u2019emp\u00eachait le plaignant de produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant d\u2019autres obstacles syst\u00e9miques all\u00e9gu\u00e9s au sein de la CISR, qui peuvent maintenant faire partie de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Cela est renforc\u00e9 par le fait que la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au TDFP a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et tranch\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Tout obstacle syst\u00e9mique all\u00e9gu\u00e9 au sein de la CISR qui constituait le fondement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e9tait connu du plaignant avant que soit tranch\u00e9e l\u2019affaire soumise au TDFP. Ces obstacles syst\u00e9miques all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, de m\u00eame que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve connexes, auraient pu \u2013 et d\u00fb \u2013 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au TDFP dans le cadre des preuves circonstancielles du plaignant au sujet de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans cette affaire.\n[77] C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019examen de sa plainte fond\u00e9e sur la LEFP, le plaignant a eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au sujet de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 la CISR. Maintenant, devant le Tribunal, il n\u2019est pas sens\u00e9 de d\u00e9penser des ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es pour d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau de ce qui constitue essentiellement la m\u00eame all\u00e9gation. Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019\u00ab [\u2026] inviter au \u201ccontr\u00f4le judiciaire\u201d de la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un autre tribunal ou au r\u00e9examen d\u2019une question d\u00fbment tranch\u00e9e pour voir si un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent pourrait en \u00e9merger \u00bb (Figliola, au paragraphe 38). Comme le fait actuellement le plaignant, la bonne fa\u00e7on de contester la d\u00e9cision du TDFP est de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[78] Appliquant les principes de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e ou de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure, de m\u00eame que les principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, je conclus que le sujet de la pr\u00e9sente instance a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 par le TDFP. Par cons\u00e9quent, trancher la plainte dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce serait assimilable \u00e0 un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, et il y a lieu de la rejeter.\n[79] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de faire rejeter la plainte est accueillie. Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire de traiter des questions E \u00e0 I qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es aux paragraphes 32 et 33 qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

L\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa avec le plaignant, en partie en raison de la maladie de sa m\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse occupaient deux r\u00e9sidences. Compte tenu de cette situation, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour occupation temporaire de deux r\u00e9sidences en vertu de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\n[2] La plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce porte sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de sa directive sur la r\u00e9installation. Le plaignant soutient que, dans son interpr\u00e9tation et son application de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 [la Loi], fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille et la d\u00e9ficience.\nII. Le contexte [3] Le Tribunal a tenu une audience pour cette affaire du 15 au 17 avril et le 7 mai 2013, \u00e0 Ottawa (Ontario).\n[4] Le premier jour de l\u2019audience, les parties se sont entendues sur un \u00e9nonc\u00e9 partiel des faits importants. Les faits convenus sont les suivants.\n[5] Le plaignant travaillait \u00e0 Sydney (Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse) pour le gouvernement dans l\u2019industrie des mines de charbon souterraines sous r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au Cap\u2011Breton (Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse). Il \u00e9tait conseiller principal, EN-ENG-05, pour la Commission de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans les mines de charbon.\n[6] En 1999, l\u2019employeur du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019a avis\u00e9 que son poste deviendrait exc\u00e9dentaire.\n[7] Le 21 janvier 2002, le plaignant a re\u00e7u une lettre officielle d\u2019emploi et de r\u00e9affectation \u00e0 Ottawa, dat\u00e9e du 14 janvier 2002, de Micheline B\u00e9langer\u2011Br\u00fbl\u00e9, gestionnaire des ressources humaines pour l\u2019intim\u00e9.

Cette lettre \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une lettre modifi\u00e9e de r\u00e9affectation (la lettre du 18 f\u00e9vrier 2002).\n[9] Par courriel envoy\u00e9 le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2002, le plaignant a accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre modifi\u00e9e de r\u00e9affectation.

Elle a emm\u00e9nag\u00e9 dans un centre de soins de longue dur\u00e9e le 9 octobre 2003.\n[14] Le 22 septembre 2004, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019indemnisation (IOTDR) en vertu de la Directive du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor sur l\u2019Indemnit\u00e9 pour occupation temporaire de deux r\u00e9sidences (la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR). Entre autres, il a justifi\u00e9 sa demande d\u2019indemnisation par le fait que son \u00e9pouse devait rester \u00e0 Sydney (Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse) pour s\u2019occuper de sa m\u00e8re. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e \u00e9tait de 21 247 $ et couvrait les douze premiers mois de la r\u00e9installation, soit du 1er octobre 2002 au 20 septembre 2003.\n[15] La Directive sur la r\u00e9installation en vigueur au d\u00e9but de la r\u00e9installation du plaignant \u00e9tait la \u00ab Directive sur la r\u00e9installation \u2013 En vigueur jusqu\u2019au 31 mars 2003 (Archiv\u00e9e) \u00bb, qui est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en mars 1993 (la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993).

La CRTFP a rendu sa d\u00e9cision rejetant le grief du plaignant le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2007. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 pour les m\u00eames motifs qu\u2019au troisi\u00e8me palier (voir Hicks c. Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (Minist\u00e8re des Ressources humaines et du D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences), 2007 CRTFP 16.\n[29] Le 26 octobre 2007, la Commission a avis\u00e9 le plaignant qu\u2019elle ne ferait pas enqu\u00eate sur sa plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)c) de la Loi.

La conciliation a eu lieu, mais a \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuse, et l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission.\n[31] La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire au Tribunal le 9 novembre 2011.\nIII. Les arguments du plaignant [32] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il y a eu violation des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi, fond\u00e9e sur les motifs de distinction illicites de la situation de famille et de la d\u00e9ficience. \u00c0 ce sujet, les dispositions applicables de la Loi sont ainsi libell\u00e9es :\n3(1) Pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n[33] Dans une instance engag\u00e9e devant le Tribunal, la partie plaignante doit \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie \u00ab [\u2026] porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Simpsons Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28).\n[34] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce se limite \u00e0 la question de savoir si la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab personne \u00e0 charge \u00bb dans la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 est discriminatoire, le plaignant soutient que la nature de la plainte est la suivante : la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de refuser de payer une indemnit\u00e9 au sens de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Le formulaire de plainte du plaignant et son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sont conformes \u00e0 cette position et je ne vois aucune raison de limiter la port\u00e9e de la plainte comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 le propose.\n[35] Cela \u00e9tant dit, le plaignant n\u2019a pas soutenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait refus\u00e9 de l\u2019employer ou de continuer \u00e0 l\u2019employer, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi, ou que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 ont priv\u00e9 le plaignant d\u2019occasions d\u2019emploi, au sens de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, la plainte est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 une analyse au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[36] Dans un m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que le motif de la d\u00e9ficience soit applicable aux circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant, n\u2019est pas atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait atteinte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Bien que la d\u00e9ficience de la belle\u2011m\u00e8re ait pu \u00eatre un facteur qui a d\u00e9fini la situation de famille du plaignant dans les circonstances entra\u00eenant la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant n\u2019a pas subi de diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable en raison de sa propre d\u00e9ficience, et il ne soutient pas non plus que sa belle-m\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[37] Par cons\u00e9quent, en analysant la plainte du plaignant, je n\u2019examinerai que la question de savoir si, dans le cadre de son emploi, le plaignant a subi une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi.\n[38] La \u00ab diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00bb signifie la distinction dans la fa\u00e7on d\u2019agir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de personnes (voir Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2009 CF 1009, au paragraphe 44 [Tahmourpour]; d\u00e9cision modifi\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs dans Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2010 CAF 192 [Tahmourpour (CAF)]; et Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, au paragraphe 254, conf. par 2013 CAF 75). Cependant, toute distinction n\u2019est pas discriminatoire, parce que la Loi pr\u00e9cise la diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00e0 l\u2019aide du terme \u00ab d\u00e9favorable \u00bb. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, \u00ab d\u00e9favorable \u00bb est un adjectif dont le sens ordinaire signifie nuisible, blessant ou hostile (voir Tahmourpour, au paragraphe 44; voir aussi Tahmourpour (CAF), au paragraphe 12). Enfin, la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[39] La Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 et le crit\u00e8re pour obtenir l\u2019IOTDR cr\u00e9ent une diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre les personnes \u00ab qui r\u00e9sident en permanence avec l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00bb et celles qui r\u00e9sident ailleurs. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient aussi que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas non plus droit \u00e0 l\u2019IOTDR parce que sa belle-m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une personne qui souffrait d\u2019une \u00ab maladie temporaire \u00bb au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2.11.2(a) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993, parce qu\u2019elle souffrait d\u2019une maladie chronique.\n[40] Ces diff\u00e9rences ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nuisibles au plaignant parce qu\u2019elles ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le rejet de sa demande d\u2019IOTDR. Le rejet de sa demande lui a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 nuisible parce qu\u2019il a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme signifiant que sa belle-m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un membre de sa famille. Le plaignant a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le rejet de sa demande d\u2019IOTDR et les griefs subs\u00e9quents lui ont caus\u00e9 du stress et de la frustration envers son employeur. Ce stress a entra\u00een\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes physiques : incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir, probl\u00e8mes de digestion et souffles cardiaques. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a finalement d\u00fb prendre un cong\u00e9 de 40 jours li\u00e9 au stress.\n[41] La prochaine question est celle de savoir si les diff\u00e9rences de traitement cr\u00e9\u00e9es par la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 envers le plaignant \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur sa situation de famille. La Loi ne d\u00e9finit pas l\u2019expression \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb. Cependant, la jurisprudence a reconnu que le motif prot\u00e8ge l\u2019\u00e9tat au sens absolu d\u2019\u00eatre ou non dans une relation de famille, l\u2019\u00e9tat au sens relatif de qui sont les membres de la famille, les circonstances ou les caract\u00e9ristiques particuli\u00e8res de la famille et les devoirs et obligations qui peuvent \u00eatre impos\u00e9s dans une famille (voir B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66, aux paragraphes 39 \u00e0 41 et 57; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113, aux paragraphes 104 \u00e0 113 [Johnstone]).\n[42] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9pouse et la belle-m\u00e8re du plaignant font partie de sa famille. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas non plus que les soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en vertu du motif de la situation de famille. Bien que je ne connaisse pas de d\u00e9cision du Tribunal portant sur la question des services aux a\u00een\u00e9s, je conclus que le raisonnement du Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario dans la d\u00e9cision Devaney v. ZRV Holdings Limited, 2012 HRTO 1590 [Devaney] est pertinent.\n[43] Dans cette affaire, M. Devaney \u00e9tait un architecte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il devait s\u2019absenter du travail et qu\u2019une grande partie de ces absences \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires en raison de sa situation de famille : il devait prendre soin de sa m\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s malade. Aucun autre membre de sa famille ne pouvait prendre soin d\u2019elle. Le nom de sa m\u00e8re figurait sur une liste d\u2019attente d\u2019urgence pour un centre de soins de longue dur\u00e9e, mais tant qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas y d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, son fils \u00e9tait le principal fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9. L\u2019employeur \u00e9tait au courant de la situation de famille de M. Devaney, mais l\u2019a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de ses absences. Pour cette raison, le Tribunal de l\u2019Ontario a conclu que M. Devaney avait \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il y avait eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur sa situation de famille.\n[44] \u00c0 mon avis, le raisonnement dans l\u2019affaire Devaney est le suivant : comme la jurisprudence reconna\u00eet que la situation de famille prot\u00e8ge les obligations en mati\u00e8re de soins aux enfants d\u2019un parent envers un enfant, r\u00e9ciproquement, les responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s d\u2019un enfant envers ses parents devraient aussi \u00eatre reconnues de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Je souscris \u00e0 ce raisonnement.\n[45] \u00c0 l\u2019audience en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s dont ils se sentaient responsables envers leur m\u00e8re\/belle-m\u00e8re et ils ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019auraient pas pu imm\u00e9diatement d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Ottawa sans abandonner ces responsabilit\u00e9s. Ils ont expliqu\u00e9 que leur m\u00e8re\/belle-m\u00e8re n\u2019habitait pas avec eux en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, qui n\u00e9cessitait une aide qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas obtenir \u00e0 leur maison. De plus, en raison de sa sant\u00e9 fragile, les m\u00e9decins ne lui avaient pas permis d\u2019\u00eatre transport\u00e9e par ambulance ou avion \u00e0 Ottawa. Le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse \u00e9taient aussi d\u2019avis que les soins ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre ad\u00e9quatement et raisonnablement fournis uniquement par des fournisseurs de soins \u00e9trangers. C\u2019est la conclusion \u00e0 laquelle ils \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9s apr\u00e8s des ann\u00e9es \u00e0 observer et \u00e0 soigner leur m\u00e8re\/belle-m\u00e8re alors que sa sant\u00e9 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorait graduellement.\n[46] \u00c0 ce sujet, le plaignant et son \u00e9pouse ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du fait que la sant\u00e9 de la belle-m\u00e8re du plaignant avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer vers 2001 et au sujet des responsabilit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 cet \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant avait prises pour s\u2019occuper de sa m\u00e8re. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la r\u00e9installation du plaignant, sa belle-m\u00e8re habitait dans un logement avec assistance et d\u00e9pendait beaucoup de sa fille. La belle-m\u00e8re du plaignant avait beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer et \u00e0 faire part de ses besoins, et peu de gens pouvaient communiquer avec elle. Cependant, l\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant en \u00e9tait capable.\n[47] L\u2019\u00e9pouse du plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsque sa m\u00e8re habitait dans la r\u00e9sidence pour personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es (le logement avec assistance), elle \u00e9tait responsable de fournir les soins suivants \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re : elle allait la voir plusieurs fois par jour, elle faisait son lavage, elle s\u2019occupait de ses t\u00e2ches externes comme faire l\u2019\u00e9picerie et payer les factures, elle pr\u00e9parait ses repas ou organisait la livraison de repas pr\u00e9par\u00e9s, elle organisait les soins \u00e0 domicile (repas, nettoyage, bain, etc.) et les soins infirmiers r\u00e9guliers \u00e0 domicile, elle prenait les rendez-vous avec le m\u00e9decin et accompagnait sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 ces rendez-vous et elle s\u2019occupait de toutes ses interactions sociales en organisant des visites r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et des excursions supervis\u00e9es.\n[48] Selon le plaignant, la pr\u00e9sence de son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s b\u00e9n\u00e9fique au bien-\u00eatre \u00e9motionnel de sa belle-m\u00e8re. Son \u00e9pouse communiquait fr\u00e9quemment avec les employ\u00e9s du logement avec assistance et elle surveillait constamment la sant\u00e9 de sa m\u00e8re.\n[49] Comme le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant le montre, si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait de sa situation de famille, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire l\u2019engagement du plaignant et de son \u00e9pouse \u00e0 prendre soin de leur m\u00e8re\/belle-m\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e et malade, il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de garder deux r\u00e9sidences apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9installation du plaignant et ce dernier n\u2019aurait pas demand\u00e9 d\u2019IOTDR.\n[50] Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le rejet de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant n\u2019a pas caus\u00e9 de conflit entre ses obligations envers sa famille et les exigences de son travail. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant a admis que son \u00e9pouse avait pris soin de sa belle-m\u00e8re malgr\u00e9 le rejet de la demande d\u2019IOTDR.\n[51] Je conviens que les circonstances de la plainte ne visent pas un \u00ab [\u2026] r\u00e8glement ou une condition de travail [qui] entrave la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 de s\u2019acquitter d\u2019une importante obligation parentale de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste [\u2026] \u00bb (voir Johnstone, au paragraphe 125). La nature de la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019est pas un conflit entre le travail du plaignant et ses obligations familiales, mais elle porte sur le rejet d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9.\n[52] Le plaignant soutient que la discrimination d\u00e9coule de la fourniture s\u00e9lective des avantages de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR. \u00c0 ce sujet, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLa couverture s\u00e9lective constitue peut\u2011\u00eatre simplement un moyen d\u00e9tourn\u00e9 de permettre la discrimination. Les avantages sociaux sont de plus en plus souvent int\u00e9gr\u00e9s dans les conditions de travail. D\u00e8s qu\u2019un employeur d\u00e9cide de fournir un r\u00e9gime d\u2019avantages sociaux, il ne peut pas faire d\u2019exclusions de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire. [...] Les avantages fournis dans le cadre de l\u2019emploi doivent \u00eatre fournis sans discrimination.\nBrooks c. Canada Safeway ltd., [1989] 1 RCS 1219, \u00e0 la page 1240\n[53] Pour \u00e9tablir si un r\u00e9gime d\u2019avantages sociaux est discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019objet du plan d\u2019avantages sociaux. Si les prestations \u00ab sont attribu\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment au m\u00eame objet, mais sont n\u00e9anmoins diff\u00e9rentes en raison de caract\u00e9ristiques non pertinentes relativement \u00e0 cet objet, il se peut bien qu\u2019il y ait discrimination \u00bb (Battlefords and District Co-operative Ltd. c. Gibbs, [1996] 3 RCS 566, au paragraphe 33).\n[54] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu plut\u00f4t, l\u2019objet de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 \u00e9tait de \u00ab [...] r\u00e9installer l\u2019employ\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on la plus efficace, c.-\u00e0-d. au co\u00fbt le plus raisonnable pour l\u2019\u00c9tat tout en causant le moins d\u2019ennuis possible \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 mut\u00e9 et \u00e0 sa famille \u00bb. La clause 1.2.2(c) de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 pr\u00e9voyait aussi que \u00ab La r\u00e9installation devrait \u00eatre planifi\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 minimiser tant les bouleversements de la vie familiale que les frais de l\u2019employeur [...] \u00bb.\n[55] Ces \u00e9nonc\u00e9s montrent clairement que la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 visait \u00e0 aider les employ\u00e9s mut\u00e9s \u00e0 se r\u00e9installer, de la fa\u00e7on la plus efficace, tout en reconnaissant que l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre temp\u00e9r\u00e9e par tout ennui que pourrait subir l\u2019employ\u00e9 mut\u00e9 ou sa famille. La Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 devait aussi s\u2019appliquer \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e0 toutes les personnes admissibles sans consid\u00e9ration [\u2026] de situation de famille \u00bb.\n[56] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019objet et l\u2019application large de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993, on a refus\u00e9 l\u2019IOTDR au plaignant en raison des caract\u00e9ristiques de sa famille : le fait que son \u00e9pouse et lui prenaient soin de sa belle-m\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e qui, en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience permanente, ne pouvait pas habiter avec eux dans la maison familiale.\n[57] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que les devoirs en mati\u00e8re de soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s rel\u00e8vent de la protection contre la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille au sens de la Loi, que les caract\u00e9ristiques de la famille du plaignant \u00e9taient d\u00e9finies par les responsabilit\u00e9s du plaignant et de son \u00e9pouse envers leur belle-m\u00e8re\/leur m\u00e8re, et qu\u2019on a refus\u00e9 au plaignant l\u2019IOTDR en raison des caract\u00e9ristiques de sa famille, par cons\u00e9quent, le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019accorder au plaignant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e en application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR constitue un acte discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi. La preuve du plaignant est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en sa faveur en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nIV. Les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [58] Comme je suis convaincu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, le fardeau revient donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination n\u2019a pas eu lieu telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ou que l\u2019acte est justifiable au sens de la Loi (voir les articles 15 \u00e0 24 de la Loi).\n[59] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 et les crit\u00e8res utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer si un employ\u00e9 a droit \u00e0 l\u2019IOTDR est une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. \u00c0 ce sujet, la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n[...]\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[60] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, une justification raisonnable existe pour le fait qu\u2019il a limit\u00e9 le soutien financier au sens de l\u2019IOTDR aux membres de la famille qui habitent avec les employ\u00e9s et qui sont qualifi\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de personnes \u00e0 charge : un employ\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e0 maintenir une deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9sidence pour faciliter la r\u00e9installation, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il y ait des personnes \u00e0 charge qui habitent avec lui dans cette r\u00e9sidence et qui sont incapables de se r\u00e9installer au m\u00eame moment que l\u2019employ\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que les membres de la famille qui habitent dans leur propre r\u00e9sidence n\u2019ont pas besoin qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 maintienne leur ancienne r\u00e9sidence pour eux. C\u2019est en fonction de cette conclusion que, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la Couronne et les autres parties qui ont \u00e9tabli la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 ont d\u00e9fini qui \u00e9tait une personne \u00e0 charge.\n[61] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les membres de la famille qui ont d\u2019autres besoins, li\u00e9s \u00e0 leurs soins m\u00e9dicaux ou \u00e0 leurs soins quotidiens, et qui demandent de l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re en raison de ces besoins, ne rel\u00e8vent pas de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, de l\u2019aide n\u2019est pas fournie pour la s\u00e9paration volontaire de la famille pour des raisons personnelles. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR ne vise pas \u00e0 faciliter les arrangements m\u00e9dicaux ou les autres arrangements de soins pour les membres de la famille, mais qu\u2019elle vise plut\u00f4t \u00e0 leur permettre de continuer d\u2019habiter dans l\u2019ancienne r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019employ\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient en mesure de se r\u00e9installer avec l\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[62] M. Daniel Gauthier, chef, Compte cr\u00e9diteur et r\u00e9ception et d\u00e9p\u00f4t, pour Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. La majeure partie de son t\u00e9moignage portait sur la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 et sa connaissance de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant.\n[63] M. Gauthier a expliqu\u00e9 que la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant ne pouvait pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e parce que : (1) la belle-m\u00e8re du plaignant ne pouvait pas \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab personne \u00e0 charge \u00bb au sens de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993, parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019habitait pas \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence du plaignant au moment o\u00f9 le plaignant s\u2019est r\u00e9install\u00e9 et (2) la belle-m\u00e8re du plaignant \u00e9tait une personne ayant une incapacit\u00e9 permanente et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une personne atteinte d\u2019une maladie temporaire, au sens de la clause 2.11.2 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993.\n[64] M. Gauthier a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019attribution des avantages en application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR est diff\u00e9rente si l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui fait la demande est propri\u00e9taire ou s\u2019il est locataire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a conclu que le plaignant louait sa maison en Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019avait pas droit aux avantages de l\u2019IOTDR pr\u00e9vus aux clauses 2.11 \u00e0 2.18 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993. M. Gauthier a reconnu que le plaignant avait cependant droit \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la clause 3.2.1, qui aurait permis au plaignant d\u2019obtenir un paiement mensuel de 420 $.\n[65] Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 de relever une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pr\u00e9cise dans la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 qui appuyait son interpr\u00e9tation de la diff\u00e9rence entre les propri\u00e9taires et les locataires, M. Gauthier a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le faire. Par cons\u00e9quent, il semble que son interpr\u00e9tation de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 n\u2019est pas soutenue par le libell\u00e9 de la Directive.\n[66] Plus d\u2019une fois, M. Gauthier a soulign\u00e9 aussi dans son t\u00e9moignage le fait que la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 accordait la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation efficiente des ressources publiques. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas parl\u00e9 de l\u2019autre objectif de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993, soit celui de causer le moins d\u2019ennuis possible \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 mut\u00e9 et \u00e0 sa famille.\n[67] Dans l\u2019ensemble, je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Gauthier particuli\u00e8rement persuasif ou utile pour comprendre l\u2019all\u00e9gation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle son interpr\u00e9tation et son application de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 \u00e0 la situation du plaignant d\u00e9coulaient d\u2019une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[68] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune explication, par l\u2019entremise de son t\u00e9moin ou autrement, sur la raison pour laquelle une interpr\u00e9tation de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993, qui comprenait la situation de famille du plaignant en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son besoin de maintenir deux r\u00e9sidences, aurait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 une contrainte excessive. En fait, compte tenu de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation en vigueur actuellement, qui \u00e9largit la d\u00e9finition de personnes \u00e0 charge pour inclure les personnes qui n\u2019habitent pas avec l\u2019employ\u00e9, il aurait pu \u00eatre difficile pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 de s\u2019expliquer.\n[69] \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019argument selon lequel la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 \u00e9tait une politique n\u00e9goci\u00e9e entre le Conseil national mixte et l\u2019intim\u00e9, et qu\u2019elle fait partie de la convention collective du plaignant, n\u2019est pas non plus pertinent. La Loi n\u2019est pas n\u00e9gociable et elle doit \u00eatre respect\u00e9e, peu importe les dispositions d\u2019une convention collective.\n[70] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 la norme pour \u00e9tablir une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e et une contrainte excessive dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2010 TCDP 20 :\n[348] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation des employeurs en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement est une obligation juridique fondamentale. Un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination est n\u00e9cessaire pour respecter un objectif l\u00e9gitime de travail et doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve directe qu\u2019il a atteint une contrainte excessive dans ses efforts pour accommoder les besoins de l\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[349] Aussi dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [\u00e0] moins qu\u2019aucun accommodement ne soit possible sans imposer une contrainte excessive, la norme telle qu\u2019elle existe n\u2019est pas une EPJ, et la preuve prima facie de l\u2019existence de discrimination n\u2019est pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[350] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences c. Via Rail Canada Inc., [2007] A.C.S. no 15 (Via Rail), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [i]l y a contrainte excessive lorsque les moyens raisonnables d\u2019accommoder ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s et qu\u2019il ne reste que des options d\u2019accommodement d\u00e9raisonnables ou irr\u00e9alistes \u00bb.\n[351] Ces arr\u00eats \u00e9tablissent de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s \u00e9vidente une obligation de la part de l\u2019ASFC de faire de r\u00e9els efforts pour accommoder, efforts qui sont tangibles et mesurables et qui \u00e9valuent la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019employeur de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d\u2019accommodement. L\u2019ASFC ne doit pas fonder son \u00e9valuation sur la question de savoir si l\u2019employ\u00e9 a besoin d\u2019accommodement ou si elle peut prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, sur des [traduction] \u00ab hypoth\u00e8ses relevant de l\u2019impression \u00bb.\n[71] L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun objectif li\u00e9 au travail ou preuve affirmative de l\u2019existence d\u2019une contrainte excessive l\u00e9gitime pour justifier la preuve prima facie de discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La supposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 justifiant sa politique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, soit que les membres de la famille qui habitent dans leur propre r\u00e9sidence n\u2019ont pas besoin qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 maintienne leur ancienne r\u00e9sidence pour eux, ne tenait \u00e9videmment pas compte de situations de famille comme celle du plaignant. De plus, l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel la situation de famille du plaignant existait en raison d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab s\u00e9paration volontaire de la famille pour des raisons personnelles \u00bb et que [traduction] \u00ab la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR ne vise pas \u00e0 faciliter les arrangements m\u00e9dicaux ou les autres arrangements de soins pour les membres de la famille \u00bb ne tient pas compte des devoirs et des obligations au sein de la famille du plaignant qui sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le motif de la situation de famille au sens de la Loi. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 contredit aussi l\u2019objet de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 de causer le moins d\u2019ennuis \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 mut\u00e9 et \u00e0 sa famille.\n[72] Par cons\u00e9quent, en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et de mon analyse ci\u2011dessus, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli d\u2019exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination envers le plaignant. Je conclus donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille du plaignant.\nV. Conclusion [73] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal conclut que la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est justifi\u00e9e :\n(1) le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille;\n(2) l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019explication raisonnable ou d\u2019autre justification \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie contre lui.\nVI. Les mesures de redressement [74] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, si, \u00e0 la fin d\u2019une instruction, le Tribunal conclue qu\u2019une plainte est justifi\u00e9e, il peut rendre une ordonnance contre la personne qui a commis l\u2019acte discriminatoire. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant demande une ordonnance imposant les mesures de redressement suivantes : le paiement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 en application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR, une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un acte discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, et les int\u00e9r\u00eats applicables.\n[75] L\u2019objectif du Tribunal, lorsqu\u2019il rend une ordonnance au sens du paragraphe 53(2), n\u2019est pas de punir la personne qui a commis l\u2019acte discriminatoire, mais d\u2019\u00e9liminer \u2013 le plus possible \u2013 les effets discriminatoires de l\u2019acte (voir Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, au paragraphe 13). Il faut pour cela que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de redressement en ob\u00e9issant \u00e0 des principes, en tenant compte du lien qui existe entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis et la perte all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au paragraphe 37). Autrement dit, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement de mani\u00e8re raisonnable, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire ainsi qu\u2019aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (Hughes c. \u00c9lections Canada, 2010 TCDP 4, au paragraphe 50).\nA. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 au sens de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR (i) Requ\u00eate en pr\u00e9clusion pour question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e [76] Avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition de la plainte, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en ordonnance d\u00e9clarant que le principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s\u2019applique au montant de l\u2019IOTDR demand\u00e9e et que le montant de l\u2019IOTDR en question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de 21 427 $.\n[77] Dans le cadre de l\u2019arbitrage de son grief \u00e0 la CRTFP, les deux parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, dans lequel il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\n\u00ab [\u2026] M. Hicks a expliqu\u00e9 sur sa demande que la raison pour laquelle il demandait une IOTDR \u00e9tait que son \u00e9pouse devait rester \u00e0 Sydney (N.\u2011\u00c9.) pour prendre soin de sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re qui ne pouvait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9plac\u00e9e au moment de la r\u00e9installation [\u2026] Pour sa belle-m\u00e8re, il demande 12 mois (21 247 $) d\u2019IOTDR [\u2026] \u00bb\n[78] Selon le plaignant, bien que la CRTFP ait rejet\u00e9 son grief, l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019arbitre n\u2019ont jamais soulev\u00e9, dans le cadre de l\u2019arbitrage, de pr\u00e9occupation au sujet du montant demand\u00e9 pour l\u2019IOTDR. En fait, le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a explicitement reconnu que le montant de l\u2019IOTDR en question \u00e9tait de 21 247 $, tel qu\u2019il est inscrit dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits.\n[79] Le plaignant fait valoir que le principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e devrait s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce parce qu\u2019il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu d\u00e9cision entre les m\u00eames parties sur la question de savoir si l\u2019IOTDR devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Le plaignant soutient que le principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s\u2019applique aux faits importants qui ont n\u00e9cessairement (m\u00eame si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas explicite) \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9s dans une proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il ajoute que le litige au sujet de sa demande d\u2019IOTDR a fait l\u2019objet de proc\u00e9dures entre les m\u00eames parties depuis des ann\u00e9es, mais que ce n\u2019est que maintenant, devant le Tribunal, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 conteste la question du montant dans sa cause. Le plaignant soutient que, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention de contester le montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR, il aurait d\u00fb le faire lorsque le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande, ou lors du processus de r\u00e8glement de grief.\n[80] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne s\u2019applique que dans les circonstances o\u00f9 les faits montrent clairement que la question de droit ou de fait en litige entre les m\u00eames parties a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la nature et le montant des d\u00e9penses demand\u00e9es par le plaignant en IOTDR n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s ou tranch\u00e9s dans les litiges pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents entre les parties. Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la CRTFP, bien qu\u2019il ait reconnu que le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019IOTDR de 21 247 $, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019a rien reconnu autrement. Comme la CRTFP a rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019IOTDR au motif que la belle\u2011m\u00e8re du plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une personne \u00e0 charge, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la CRTFP n\u2019a pas tranch\u00e9 la question de savoir si les d\u00e9penses all\u00e9gu\u00e9es ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, si elles pouvaient \u00eatre rembours\u00e9es en application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR.\n[81] Les deux parties s\u2019entendent sur le raisonnement du principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, expliqu\u00e9 clairement dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Danyluk c. Ainsworth Technologies Inc., 2001 CSC 44 [Danyluk] :\nAutrement dit, un plaideur n\u2019a droit qu\u2019\u00e0 une seule tentative [...] Une fois tranch\u00e9, un diff\u00e9rend ne devrait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas \u00eatre soumis \u00e0 nouveau aux tribunaux au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de la partie d\u00e9bout\u00e9e et au d\u00e9triment de la partie qui a eu gain de cause. Une personne ne devrait \u00eatre tracass\u00e9e qu\u2019une seule fois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une m\u00eame cause d\u2019action.\n(Danyluk, au paragraphe 18)\n[82] Les deux parties s\u2019entendent aussi sur les trois conditions pr\u00e9alables du fonctionnement du principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, telles qu\u2019elles sont \u00e9tablies dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Danyluk :\n1. que la m\u00eame question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9e;\n2. que la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e comme cr\u00e9ant la [pr\u00e9clusion] soit finale;\n3. que les parties dans la d\u00e9cision judiciaire invoqu\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit, soient les m\u00eames que les parties engag\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9clusion est soulev\u00e9e, ou leurs ayants droit.\n(Danyluk, au paragraphe 25)\n[83] Le seul litige pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent entre les parties sur la question des droits du plaignant en vertu de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR s\u2019est sold\u00e9 par une d\u00e9cision de la CRTFP.\n[84] Cependant, dans sa d\u00e9cision, la CRTFP n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 la question du montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant.\n[85] En fait, comme la CRTFP a conclu qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour entendre les arguments fond\u00e9s sur les droits de la personne du plaignant, elle a rendu sa d\u00e9cision en fonction de la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab personne \u00e0 charge \u00bb dans la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993. En se fondant sur cette d\u00e9finition, la CRTFP a conclu que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas du tout droit \u00e0 l\u2019IOTDR.\n[86] La d\u00e9cision de la CRTFP est compatible avec la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant. Dans tout le processus de grief, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a maintenu la position que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas droit \u00e0 l\u2019IOTDR. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a m\u00eame refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler la question par la m\u00e9diation parce qu\u2019il soutenait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 donner au plaignant. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Gauthier montre aussi clairement que, m\u00eame si la belle\u2011m\u00e8re du plaignant \u00e9tait une personne \u00e0 charge, l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait son propre point de vue et sa propre interpr\u00e9tation au sujet des d\u00e9penses que le plaignant pouvait r\u00e9clamer.\n[87] Pour ces motifs, \u00e0 mon avis, la question du montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par la CRTFP. L\u2019argument du plaignant au sujet du principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e est donc rejet\u00e9 suivant la premi\u00e8re condition pr\u00e9alable du fonctionnement du principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Danyluk. Il serait injuste si l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pouvait pas se d\u00e9fendre contre les d\u00e9penses que le plaignant r\u00e9clame en application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a le droit de questionner le plaignant sur chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sa demande et d\u2019en v\u00e9rifier la validit\u00e9.\n[88] Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate du plaignant en ordonnance d\u00e9clarant que le principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e s\u2019applique au montant de l\u2019IOTDR qu\u2019il demandait et que le montant de l\u2019IOTDR en question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait de 21 247 $ est rejet\u00e9e.\n(ii) Indemnit\u00e9 [89] Au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, une victime de discrimination a droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 pour toute d\u00e9pense encourue en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire. Si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait de l\u2019acte discriminatoire, le plaignant aurait eu un remboursement d\u2019une partie de ses d\u00e9penses en application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR.\n[90] Cependant, les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR et, en particulier, sur les d\u00e9penses que le plaignant peut r\u00e9clamer. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre les montants qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9clam\u00e9s par les locataires par opposition aux propri\u00e9taires. Bien que je n\u2019aie rien relev\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cet argument dans le libell\u00e9 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993, je ne crois pas que je poss\u00e8de suffisamment de renseignements pour pouvoir prendre une d\u00e9cision inform\u00e9e sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et l\u2019application de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR et pour d\u00e9terminer le montant r\u00e9el de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant.\n[91] Compte tenu de ce manque de renseignements, de ma d\u00e9cision ci\u2011dessus au sujet du principe de la question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, et du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a auparavant refus\u00e9 d\u2019offrir au plaignant quoi que ce soit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019IOTDR, je laisserai d\u2019abord les parties discuter des d\u00e9tails du montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant. Je demeurerai saisi de l\u2019affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne parviendraient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nB. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral [92] Le plaignant demande 20 000 $ en compensation pour pr\u00e9judice moral, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi. Il s\u2019agit du montant maximal d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 que le Tribunal peut accorder pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Le Tribunal n\u2019accorde le montant maximal que dans les cas les plus flagrants : lorsque la port\u00e9e et la dur\u00e9e de la souffrance du plaignant d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019acte discriminatoire justifient le montant complet.\n[93] Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait subi du stress et de la frustration envers son employeur au sujet de sa r\u00e9installation de Sydney \u00e0 Ottawa pendant une longue p\u00e9riode. Il a soutenu qu\u2019il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 souffrir de probl\u00e8mes physiques : incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 dormir, probl\u00e8mes de digestion et souffles cardiaques. Son m\u00e9decin croyait que ces probl\u00e8mes \u00e9taient caus\u00e9s par le stress. Il a d\u00fb subir des examens m\u00e9dicaux, et on lui a conseill\u00e9 de prendre cong\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2002 et que ses probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment et ont augment\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2003. Il a alors d\u00fb prendre un cong\u00e9 de maladie d\u2019environ 40 jours qui s\u2019est termin\u00e9 le 1er septembre 2003.\n[94] Le plaignant soutient que son stress a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par le fait que son probl\u00e8me avec son employeur n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 et par la bataille constante qu\u2019il avait d\u00fb livrer pour r\u00e9soudre ce probl\u00e8me, y compris le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de griefs aupr\u00e8s de son employeur.\n[95] Le plaignant a d\u00e9plor\u00e9 le fait que, pendant son \u00e9preuve, il n\u2019a jamais senti que son employeur tentait de l\u2019aider; ce dernier n\u2019a jamais montr\u00e9 de volont\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter avec lui de la fa\u00e7on dont il pouvait g\u00e9rer ses obligations familiales et, par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant s\u2019est senti abandonn\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, son employeur.\n[96] Cela dit, aucun rapport m\u00e9dical n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal. Cependant, le plaignant a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait autoris\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical, ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9. Pendant l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas non plus soulev\u00e9 d\u2019objection ni pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observation au sujet de la sant\u00e9 du plaignant.\n[97] L\u2019intim\u00e9 note cependant que le plaignant avait beaucoup d\u2019autres litiges avec son employeur au sujet de sa r\u00e9installation, en plus du rejet de sa demande d\u2019aide financi\u00e8re au sens de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, bien que le plaignant ait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9\u00e7u, frustr\u00e9 et stress\u00e9 en raison de ses divers litiges avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de sa r\u00e9installation, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9crire en quelle proportion ses sentiments \u00e9taient attribuables au rejet de sa demande d\u2019aide financi\u00e8re par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[98] Compte tenu des observations des parties ci-dessus et des circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019accorde au plaignant 15 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019il a subi en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire.\nC. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour la perp\u00e9tration d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e [99] Le plaignant demande 20 000 $ d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 parce que ce dernier a commis un acte discriminatoire de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n[100] Dans Johnstone, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au sujet du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi :\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019une disposition punitive visant \u00e0 dissuader ou \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. Pour conclure que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, il faut que l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne aient \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels. On entend par \u00ab acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb celui qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante.\n(Johnstone, au paragraphe 154).\n[101] Comme le montant maximal qui peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9 en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi est de 20 000 $, ce montant devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux cas les plus graves.\n[102] Selon le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande l\u2019importance qu\u2019elle m\u00e9ritait. Le plaignant a discut\u00e9 de sa r\u00e9installation et de sa demande d\u2019IOTDR plusieurs fois avec des repr\u00e9sentants de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et les a avis\u00e9s des raisons pour lesquelles sa belle-m\u00e8re \u00e9tait incapable d\u2019habiter avec sa famille. Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a jamais pos\u00e9 de questions au sujet de ses besoins en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 sa belle-m\u00e8re, compte tenu de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 importants et de sa d\u00e9ficience, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a appliqu\u00e9 la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019IOTDR.\n[103] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 rigoureux et diligent dans ses efforts pour que sa belle\u2011m\u00e8re soit reconnue \u00e0 titre de personne \u00e0 charge et qu\u2019il a fond\u00e9 ses arguments sur des principes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, et, pourtant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas tenu compte de sa position et a simplement m\u00e9caniquement appliqu\u00e9 une d\u00e9finition rigide qui \u00e9tait discriminatoire. \u00c0 ce sujet, le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a agi de mani\u00e8re inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e en n\u2019examinant pas si sa politique d\u2019indemnisation constituait de la discrimination et s\u2019il devait examiner la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019offrir une mesure d\u2019accommodement.\n[104] L\u2019intim\u00e9 note que son rejet de la demande d\u2019aide financi\u00e8re du plaignant au sens de la Directive sur l\u2019IOTDR a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu \u00e0 chaque palier de grief, y compris par la CRTFP, qui a aussi not\u00e9 que le rejet \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 pour d\u2019autres motifs que ceux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par le plaignant dans son grief. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec le plaignant au sujet de la question de savoir si le rejet de la demande d\u2019IOTDR soulevait une question de droits de la personne ne constitue pas un fondement pour accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\n[105] La preuve montre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a suivi une application stricte du libell\u00e9 de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993. Pendant l\u2019audience, j\u2019ai eu l\u2019impression que, pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, tout \u00e9cart au texte de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993 \u00e9tait inimaginable. De plus, aucune preuve ne m\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qui me permet de croire que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a tenu compte de la Loi lorsqu\u2019il a suivi une application aussi rigide de la Directive sur la r\u00e9installation de 1993. Lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une situation de famille difficile et \u00e0 une demande de compassion, rien ne montre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a tenu compte de son devoir de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de m\u00e9pris et d\u2019indiff\u00e9rence envers la situation de famille du plaignant et envers les cons\u00e9quences que sa d\u00e9cision de rejeter la demande d\u2019IOTDR entra\u00eenerait pour le plaignant et sa famille.\n[106] Pour tous ces motifs, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, le Tribunal accorde au plaignant 20 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 pour l\u2019acte discriminatoire inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nD. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats [107] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi, une ordonnance visant le paiement d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s peut comprendre les int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 un taux et pour une p\u00e9riode que le membre instructeur estime appropri\u00e9s. Le paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04) du Tribunal pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019\u00e0 moins d\u2019ordonnance contraire de la part du membre instructeur, tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) et courir de la date o\u00f9 l\u2019acte discriminatoire s\u2019est produit jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\n[108] Le plaignant demande le paiement des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s pour tous les montants accord\u00e9s. \u00c0 son avis, comme de nombreuses ann\u00e9es se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis que la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, le d\u00e9faut d\u2019accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s r\u00e9compenserait l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour les retards occasionn\u00e9s.\n[109] Se fondant sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Chopra c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la Sant\u00e9 nationale et du Bien-\u00eatre social), 2004 TCDP 27, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s ne sont justifi\u00e9s que si l\u2019on peut d\u00e9duire de la preuve ou des circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce que ce type d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats est n\u00e9cessaire pour compenser la perte en question. Sauf pour la longue p\u00e9riode entre le moment o\u00f9 le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission (septembre 2006) et la date o\u00f9 sa plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite par le Tribunal (avril 2013), l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui distinguent l\u2019affaire d\u2019autres plaintes dont le Tribunal est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement saisi. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, si l\u2019on ne peut pas lui attribuer la responsabilit\u00e9 des retards, ce qu\u2019il soutient, il n\u2019existe aucune circonstance sp\u00e9ciale qui ferait en sorte que le plaignant ne serait pas compl\u00e8tement indemnis\u00e9 par le paiement d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats simples.\n[110] Bien que le plaignant demande des int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s pour le d\u00e9lai entre le moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte et le moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que ce d\u00e9lai est attribuable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne vois aucune raison de ne pas appliquer l\u2019article 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03-05-04).\n[111] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accorde des int\u00e9r\u00eats pour les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courreront du 23 novembre 2004, soit la date \u00e0 laquelle la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du paiement des indemnit\u00e9s.\n[112] Lorsqu\u2019elles s\u2019entendront sur les d\u00e9tails du montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant, selon mon ordonnance ci-dessus, les parties devront aussi tenir compte des int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s, en fonction du paragraphe 111 ci-dessus.\nE. Le maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [113] Comme j\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 le soin aux parties de tenter de s\u2019entendre sur les d\u00e9tails du montant de la demande d\u2019IOTDR du plaignant, je resterai saisi de l\u2019affaire pendant trois (3) mois \u00e0 partir de la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, au cas o\u00f9 les parties n\u2019arriveraient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, je demanderai au plaignant de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites au Tribunal dans lesquelles il expliquera la nature du diff\u00e9rend et pr\u00e9sentera sa position \u00e0 ce sujet, documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Dans les deux (2) semaines suivant la r\u00e9ception des observations \u00e9crites du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourra pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9ponse. Dans la semaine suivant la r\u00e9ception des observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant pourra pr\u00e9senter une r\u00e9plique.\nSign\u00e9 par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 18 septembre 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties inscrites au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T1751\/10611\nIntitul\u00e9 : Leslie Hicks c.

Conclusion. 55\nI. Introduction et contexte historique [1] Le statut d\u2019Indien est un concept juridique cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Par diverses dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C., 1985, ch. I-5 (la Loi sur les Indiens) et ses versions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a d\u00e9fini les personnes qui ont droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab Indien \u00bb. Le concept juridique d\u2019\u00ab Indien \u00bb, de la jeune colonie \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, ne refl\u00e8te pas les coutumes traditionnelles ou actuelles des peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de leur organisation sociale et de leur appartenance \u00e0 cette organisation (voir McIvor v. The Registrar, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2007 BCSC 827, aux paragraphes 8 \u00e0 12 (McIvor)).\n[2] Avant 1985, en d\u00e9finissant qui avait droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab Indien \u00bb et qui n\u2019y avait pas droit, les versions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de la Loi sur les Indiens pr\u00e9voyaient aussi des situations o\u00f9 un \u00ab Indien \u00bb pouvait \u00eatre \u00e9mancip\u00e9 du droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription, de fa\u00e7on volontaire ou involontaire. L\u2019\u00ab \u00e9mancipation \u00bb \u00e9tait l\u2019un des principaux m\u00e9canismes par lequel le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral souhaitait r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 assimiler les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations au reste de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne. L\u2019expression fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un certain nombre de m\u00e9canismes l\u00e9gaux qui existaient dans la Loi sur les Indiens, sous des formes diverses, \u00e0 toutes les \u00e9poques pertinentes jusqu\u2019en 1985. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l\u2019\u00e9mancipation \u00e9tait un processus par lequel le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral retirait \u00e0 un Indien, \u00e0 tous ses enfants non mari\u00e9s et \u00e0 ses futurs descendants le statut d\u2019Indien et l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande en \u00e9change d\u2019incitatifs et de divers droits en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens et en vertu d\u2019autres r\u00e8glements, en fonction des m\u00e9canismes en vigueur au moment de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation. \u00c0 divers moments, ces incitatifs comprenaient, entre autres, la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne, le droit de vote aux \u00e9lections canadiennes, le droit \u00e0 un domaine \u00e0 vie ou \u00e0 un domaine en fief simple sur les terres de r\u00e9serve ou des parts par personne des fonds tenus pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations. En 1985, les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens qui permettaient l\u2019\u00e9mancipation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9es.\n[3] La politique canadienne d\u2019\u00e9mancipation des autochtones est un bon exemple de la dissonance entre la d\u00e9finition l\u00e9gale d\u2019\u00ab Indien \u00bb et la perspective des peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de leur identit\u00e9. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a not\u00e9 les d\u00e9savantages, les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, les pr\u00e9judices et la discrimination associ\u00e9s aux dispositions sur l\u2019\u00e9mancipation de la Loi sur les Indiens. Comme la juge L\u2019Heureux\u2011Dub\u00e9 l\u2019a \u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Corbiere c. Canada (Ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), [1999] 2 R.C.S. 203 (Corbiere), au paragraphe 88 : \u00ab Les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mancipation \u00e9taient con\u00e7ues pour encourager les autochtones \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 leur patrimoine et \u00e0 leur identit\u00e9, ainsi que pour les contraindre \u00e0 le faire s\u2019ils d\u00e9siraient participer pleinement \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne \u00bb. Elle a aussi not\u00e9 que l\u2019application des dispositions avait aid\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une population d\u2019anciens Indiens, qui n\u2019habitaient plus sur les r\u00e9serves et qui \u00e9taient victimes de la supposition discriminatoire selon laquelle ils \u00e9taient \u00ab moins autochtones \u00bb que ceux qui \u00e9taient rest\u00e9s sur les r\u00e9serves : Corbiere, aux paragraphes 83 \u00e0 92. S\u2019exprimant pour la majorit\u00e9, la juge McLachlin (alors juge de la Cour supr\u00eame) a aussi conclu que le fait de supposer qu\u2019un autochtone qui n\u2019habite pas sur la r\u00e9serve ne tient pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9server son identit\u00e9 culturelle constitue un st\u00e9r\u00e9otype discriminatoire : Corbiere, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 18. Dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente rendue en juillet 2012, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a unanimement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au sujet du processus d\u2019\u00e9mancipation par demande, au sens de l\u2019ancien paragraphe 108(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens :\nL\u2019\u00ab \u00e9mancipation \u00bb est un euph\u00e9misme employ\u00e9 pour d\u00e9signer l\u2019une des politiques les plus oppressives adopt\u00e9es par le gouvernement canadien au cours de l\u2019histoire de ses rapports avec les peuples autochtones (Un pass\u00e9, un avenir, Rapport de la Commission royale sur les peuples autochtones, vol. 1, (Ottawa, Groupe Communication Canada, \u00c9dition, 1996), \u00e0 la page 290).\n\u00c0 partir de 1857 et par la suite sous diff\u00e9rentes formes jusqu\u2019en 1985, l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9mancipation \u00bb visait \u00e0 assimiler les peuples autochtones et \u00e0 \u00e9radiquer leur culture ou, pour reprendre les mots employ\u00e9s dans la loi de 1857, \u00e0 \u00ab encourager le progr\u00e8s de la civilisation \u00bb chez les peuples autochtones [...]\nSuivant l\u2019une des formes d\u2019\u00ab \u00e9mancipation \u00bb \u2013 celle qui nous int\u00e9resse en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2013 les Autochtones se voyaient octroyer la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne et le droit de d\u00e9tenir une terre en fief simple.

Leslie).\n[5] \u00c0 mon avis, en particulier dans le contexte des droits de la personne, la justice ne vise pas seulement \u00e0 rectifier la violation des droits d\u2019une personne, mais devrait aussi s\u2019efforcer de r\u00e9parer toute souffrance qu\u2019une personne a pu subir en raison du traitement injuste. Un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la gu\u00e9rison est la reconnaissance de la souffrance. La reconnaissance de la souffrance d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019un groupe peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 son besoin de justice, acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le processus de gu\u00e9rison, am\u00e9liorer l\u2019estime de soi et promouvoir le respect de la dignit\u00e9 humaine. Bien que le domaine juridique fonctionne en termes de ce qui est l\u00e9gal ou ill\u00e9gal, la valeur humaine de ce qui est bien ou mal d\u00e9passe fr\u00e9quemment les questions juridiques officielles et peut ne pas toujours \u00eatre comprise dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du droit. \u00c0 mon avis, les politiques et les pratiques d\u2019\u00e9mancipation de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tement contraires aux principes et aux valeurs des droits de la personne.\n[6] Je reconnais la souffrance cr\u00e9\u00e9e par les politiques et les pratiques pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes d\u2019\u00e9mancipation du gouvernement dont ont souffert les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, y compris le plaignant, Roger William Andrews, et sa famille.\n[7] C\u2019est dans ce contexte historique d\u2019\u00e9mancipation que le plaignant d\u00e9pose les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes.\nII. Les plaintes [8] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire deux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par le plaignant.\n[9] Dans sa premi\u00e8re plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le ou vers le 20 octobre 2008, le plaignant, au nom de sa fille Michelle Dominique Andrews, soutient qu\u2019Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (AINC), l\u2019intim\u00e9, a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi), lorsqu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 la demande de statut d\u2019Indien au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens de la fille du plaignant (la premi\u00e8re plainte).\n[10] Dans sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le ou vers le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2010, le plaignant soutient aussi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi lorsqu\u2019il a accueilli sa propre demande de statut d\u2019Indien en application du paragraphe 6(2) plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en application du paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens (la deuxi\u00e8me plainte).\n[11] Le point central des plaintes, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit par les parties dans leur expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, est que le plaignant conteste les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens et soutient qu\u2019elles constituent de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et le statut de famille.\n[12] Les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consolid\u00e9es en une seule audience (voir Roger William Andrews c. Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 22), qui a eu lieu du 15 au 19 octobre, du 22 au 26 octobre et du 7 au 9 novembre 2012, \u00e0 Surrey, en Colombie-Britannique.\nIII. Le contexte [13] Le p\u00e8re du plaignant, Andrew Joseph, a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit d\u00e8s la naissance comme un membre de la Premi\u00e8re nation Naotkamegwanning, aussi connue sous le nom de bande indienne de Whitefish Bay et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9tait un Indien au sens du sous-alin\u00e9a 2d)(i) de la Loi des Indiens, L.R.C. 1927, ch. 98.\n[14] Son p\u00e8re a \u00e9pous\u00e9 Isabella McCafferty, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de descendance autochtone, mais qui est devenue une Indienne au sens du sous-alin\u00e9a 2d)(iii) de la Loi des Indiens, L.R.C. 1927, ch. 98, lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9pous\u00e9 Andrew Joseph. Ils ont eu une fille, Jessie Joseph, le 22 d\u00e9cembre 1955. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Jessie Joseph a \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrite comme Indienne et est devenue membre de la bande indienne Naotkamegwanning en raison de son affiliation \u00e0 son p\u00e8re.\n[15] Par demande \u00e9crite dat\u00e9e du 8 janvier 1957, Andrew Joseph a demand\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9mancipation au sens du paragraphe 108(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1952, ch. 149. Par l\u2019\u00e9mancipation, Andrew Joseph, son \u00e9pouse et sa fille c\u00e9libataire cesseraient d\u2019\u00eatre des Indiens au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens en \u00e9change de divers incitatifs.\n[16] Par d\u00e9cret dat\u00e9 du 21 mars 1957, M. Joseph a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mancip\u00e9, ainsi que son \u00e9pouse, Isabella Joseph (n\u00e9e McCafferty), et leur fille, Jessie Joseph. Par cons\u00e9quent, tous trois ont cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre des Indiens au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1952, ch. 149, article 109, modifi\u00e9e par L.R.C. 1956, ch. 40, article 27, et leurs noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s du registre des Indiens et de la liste des membres de la bande indienne.\n[17] Le plaignant est n\u00e9 en 1958. Sa m\u00e8re, Marie Holden, n\u2019a pas et n\u2019a jamais eu droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription comme Indienne au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens. En raison de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation de son p\u00e8re en 1957, lorsque le plaignant est n\u00e9, il n\u2019a pas eu droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1952, ch. 149. Si le p\u00e8re du plaignant ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9mancip\u00e9, le plaignant aurait eu droit, \u00e0 la naissance, \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens, L.R.C. 1952, ch. 149, \u00e0 titre d\u2019homme qui est descendant direct de la lign\u00e9e paternelle d\u2019un membre de la bande masculin.\n[18] Le plaignant a \u00e9pous\u00e9 Georgina Maltzan en 1976, qui n\u2019a pas et n\u2019a jamais eu droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription comme Indienne au sens de la Loi sur les Indiens. Ils ont deux filles : Cheryl Andrews, n\u00e9e le 9 mai 1983, et Michelle Andrews, n\u00e9e le 4 d\u00e9cembre 1986.\n[19] En 1985, les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens qui permettaient l\u2019\u00e9mancipation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9es. La Loi sur les Indiens a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e afin de r\u00e9tablir le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription pour ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mancip\u00e9s. En particulier, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) de la Loi sur les Indiens a cr\u00e9\u00e9 le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription pour les personnes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9es par d\u00e9cret conform\u00e9ment aux anciennes dispositions sur l\u2019\u00e9mancipation. Cependant, l\u2019article 7 pr\u00e9voyait aussi qu\u2019une personne ne pouvait pas \u00eatre inscrite si, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, elle (i) n\u2019avait aucun droit au statut d\u2019Indien d\u00e9coulant de sa propre descendance, (ii) avait obtenu le statut d\u2019Indien avant 1985 en mariant un homme indien et (iii) avait perdu ce statut avant 1985 en raison d\u2019une demande d\u2019\u00e9mancipation.\n[20] En 1985, l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur du projet de loi C-31 a entra\u00een\u00e9 de nombreuses modifications aux dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens. Depuis, ce sont les paragraphes 6(1) et 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens qui d\u00e9crivent les diverses personnes qui ont droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens. Les modifications ont aussi introduit la formulation actuelle de ce qui est commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9 \u00ab la r\u00e8gle d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la deuxi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration \u00bb. Cette r\u00e8gle met fin au droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 partir de la deuxi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration cons\u00e9cutive d\u2019affiliation avec une personne qui n\u2019est pas un Indien. La r\u00e8gle d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la deuxi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration fonctionne ainsi :\n\u2022 6(1) a un enfant avec 6(1) = enfant 6(1)\n\u2022 6(1) a un enfant avec 6(2) = enfant 6(1)\n\u2022 6(2) a un enfant avec 6(2) = enfant 6(1)\n\u2022 6(1) a un enfant avec un non-Indien = enfant 6(2)\n\u2022 6(2) a un enfant avec un non-Indien = enfant non-Indien\n[21] Avant les modifications de 1985 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens, le statut d\u2019Indien \u00e9tait presque enti\u00e8rement fond\u00e9 sur le lien patrilin\u00e9aire avec un homme Indien. Par exemple, les enfants d\u2019hommes indiens qui avaient \u00e9pous\u00e9 des femmes non-indiennes obtenaient le statut d\u2019Indien; cependant, les enfants de femmes indiennes qui avaient \u00e9pous\u00e9 des hommes non-indiens n\u2019avaient pas droit au statut. La r\u00e8gle d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 de la deuxi\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite afin de tenter d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les hommes et les femmes en cr\u00e9ant une norme sans distinction de sexe pour le droit au statut d\u2019Indien. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9crit plus haut, le statut des enfants est d\u00e9sormais d\u00e9termin\u00e9 en fonction du statut des deux parents, et non du p\u00e8re seul.\n[22] Gr\u00e2ce aux modifications de 1985, le p\u00e8re du plaignant, Andrew Joseph, et la demie-s\u0153ur du plaignant, Jessie Joseph, ont obtenu le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Isabella Joseph (n\u00e9e McCafferty), dont l\u2019ancien statut d\u00e9coulait uniquement de son mariage \u00e0 Andrew Joseph, n\u2019a pas r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 le statut, compte tenu de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le plaignant a obtenu le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en application du paragraphe 6(2), parce qu\u2019il est l\u2019enfant d\u2019une personne admissible au statut en application du paragraphe 6(1) (Andrew Joseph) et d\u2019une non-indienne (Marie Holden). Le plaignant n\u2019avait pas droit au statut en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) parce que son nom n\u2019apparaissait pas sur le d\u00e9cret d\u2019\u00e9mancipation, puisqu\u2019il est n\u00e9 apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9mancipation de son p\u00e8re.\n[23] Le 29 juillet 2004, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019inscription au statut d\u2019Indien en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. Sa demande \u00e9tait \u00e9tay\u00e9e par divers documents \u00e9tablissant la situation du plaignant et l\u2019historique de sa famille. Le 21 ao\u00fbt 2006, le Bureau du registraire des Indiens a avis\u00e9 le plaignant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un Indien inscrit au sens du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens et un membre de la bande Naotkamegwanning, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11(2)b).\n[24] Le 19 octobre 2006, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019inscription au statut d\u2019Indien en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens au nom de sa fille, Michelle Andrews. Cette demande comprenait des renseignements au sujet du p\u00e8re de Michelle Andrews (le plaignant), mais aucun renseignement au sujet de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la m\u00e8re de Michelle Andrews (Georgina Maltzan). Le 20 mars 2007, le Bureau du registraire des Indiens a avis\u00e9 Michelle Andrews que, comme l\u2019un de ses parents (son p\u00e8re Roger Andrews) \u00e9tait inscrit en application du paragraphe 6(2) et qu\u2019aucun renseignement n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au sujet de sa m\u00e8re, il n\u2019y avait aucune disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens qui permettait d\u2019inscrire son nom dans le Registre des Indiens.\n[25] Le 30 mars 2009, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une protestation au Bureau du registraire des Indiens, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.2 de la Loi sur les Indiens, dans laquelle il expliquait qu\u2019il souhaitait porter en appel, entre autres, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019inscrire en application du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en application d\u2019une des dispositions du paragraphe 6(1), et la d\u00e9cision de refuser \u00e0 Michelle Andrews le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription.\n[26] Le 4 juin 2010, le Bureau du registraire des Indiens a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 M. Andrews expliquant les dispositions de la loi et expliquant comment elles fonctionnaient, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui donner le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au sens du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, mais pas au sens d\u2019une des dispositions du paragraphe 6(1). La lettre expliquait aussi que, comme le plaignant n\u2019avait pas fourni de nouveaux renseignements ni de nouveaux arguments sur la fa\u00e7on dont les renseignements qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis devraient \u00eatre analys\u00e9s, sa lettre ne pouvait pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9e comme protestation valide.\n[27] Quant \u00e0 sa fille, Michelle Andrews, la lettre du 4 juin 2010 expliquait que, comme elle \u00e9tait adulte, elle devait envoyer sa propre lettre de protestation. Au moment o\u00f9 la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, Michelle Andrews n\u2019avait pas envoy\u00e9 de protestation au sujet de la d\u00e9cision du Bureau du registraire des Indiens au sujet de sa demande d\u2019inscription.\nIV. Les positions des parties A. Le plaignant [28] Selon le plaignant, en raison de son statut au sens du paragraphe 6(2) et du refus d\u2019octroyer le statut \u00e0 sa fille, la version actuelle de la Loi sur les Indiens poursuit les effets discriminatoires des dispositions portant sur l\u2019\u00e9mancipation qui existaient dans les versions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de la Loi sur les Indiens. Il soutient que, bien que les modifications de 1985 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens aient partiellement annul\u00e9 les effets de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation, les gens comme sa fille et lui continuent de subir les effets discriminatoires de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation de leurs anc\u00eatres.\n[29] Si son p\u00e8re ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e9mancip\u00e9, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il aurait eu droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au sens de n\u2019importe quelle version de la Loi sur les Indiens avant 1985 et au statut en vertu du paragraphe 6(1) de la version actuelle de la Loi sur les Indiens. S\u2019il avait le statut d\u2019Indien au sens du paragraphe 6(1), le plaignant pourrait alors l\u00e9guer le statut d\u2019Indienne au sens du paragraphe 6(2) \u00e0 sa fille, Michelle Andrews.\n[30] Le plaignant note que, bien que les modifications de 1985 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens aient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es afin de tenter d\u2019att\u00e9nuer la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la discrimination caus\u00e9e par l\u2019\u00e9mancipation, le gouvernement n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9liminer ces types de discrimination. Selon le plaignant, la situation actuelle de sa fille et sa propre situation actuelle en ce qui a trait au statut d\u2019Indien en sont la preuve, tout comme la conclusion de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 BCCA 153 [McIvor]. Dans McIvor, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que les alin\u00e9as 6(1)a) et 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens violaient le droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 au sens de l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas justifi\u00e9s par l\u2019article premier de la m\u00eame Charte. En somme, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que certains aspects du r\u00e9gime d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens continuaient d\u2019\u00eatre discriminatoires envers les descendants d\u2019hommes et de femmes indiens, malgr\u00e9 les modifications de 1985 visant \u00e0 corriger une telle in\u00e9galit\u00e9.\n[31] Le plaignant note aussi que, lorsque le gouvernement a examin\u00e9 comment modifier la Loi sur les Indiens, avant les modifications de 1985, le gouvernement avait d\u2019abord pens\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tendre le statut aux personnes qui ont un quart d\u2019h\u00e9ritage indien. Selon le plaignant, si cette norme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e plut\u00f4t que le r\u00e9gime actuel, elle aurait permis \u00e0 une g\u00e9n\u00e9ration suppl\u00e9mentaire de personnes d\u2019obtenir le statut d\u2019Indien, ce qui aurait inclus sa fille et lui-m\u00eame. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61 (Moore), le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas correctement examin\u00e9 cette alternative aux dispositions actuelles portant sur l\u2019inscription dans la Loi sur les Indiens; ni la fa\u00e7on dont les dispositions actuelles traitent diff\u00e9remment des fr\u00e8res et des s\u0153urs de la m\u00eame famille affect\u00e9s par l\u2019\u00e9mancipation. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu des dispositions actuelles en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, le plaignant soutient que la loi est toujours discriminatoire.\nB. La Commission [32] Selon la Commission, les dispositions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9mancipation de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur la supposition, en temps colonial, que les Autochtones, avec le temps, abandonneraient leur culture et leur mode de vie traditionnels, et seraient absorb\u00e9s par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 euro-canadienne \u00ab civilis\u00e9e \u00bb. Ces suppositions, ainsi que la politique qu\u2019avait le gouvernement d\u2019encourager l\u2019\u00e9mancipation, \u00e9taient oppressives, visaient l\u2019assimilation et constituaient de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race. La Commission soutient que les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens ne satisfont pas aux exigences de la Loi, en ce qu\u2019elles continuent de permettre que les droits actuels de Roger et Michelle Andrews soient affect\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative par l\u2019\u00e9mancipation pass\u00e9e d\u2019Andrew Joseph.\n[33] L\u2019argument de la Commission est fond\u00e9 sur le fait que la Loi permet le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes contestant les r\u00e9percussions discriminatoires d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Selon la Commission, la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada \u00e9tablit que, sous r\u00e9serve de textes de loi \u00e9tablissant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment le contraire, les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne priment sur les autres lois et rendent inop\u00e9rantes les lois incompatibles.\n[34] \u00c0 ce sujet, la Commission soutient que le dossier en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination : l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien est un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, le plaignant et sa fille (i) se sont vus refuser ce service ou (ii) ont subi une distinction illicite par rapport \u00e0 la prestation de services, et un tel refus ou une telle distinction illicite sont li\u00e9s aux motifs de distinction illicite de la race ou de la situation de famille.\n[35] La Commission soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9, en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 cette preuve prima facie de discrimination, n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 son fardeau de prouver qu\u2019il existe un motif justifiable pour la discrimination. Selon la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 (i) qu\u2019il a d\u00fbment pris en consid\u00e9ration les circonstances des personnes dans la situation du plaignant et de sa fille ou (ii) qu\u2019il subirait une contrainte excessive s\u2019il devait \u00e9liminer le refus ou la distinction illicite contest\u00e9s en donnant un statut au sens du paragraphe 6(1) \u00e0 M. Andrews et un statut au sens du paragraphe 6(2) \u00e0 sa fille. \u00c0 ce sujet, la Commission soutient que la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore confirme que, s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuve qu\u2019on a d\u00fbment pris en consid\u00e9ration les accommodements visant \u00e0 tenir compte des circonstances des personnes dans la situation du plaignant et de sa fille, toute pr\u00e9tention qu\u2019il existe un motif justifiable pour les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens ne peut \u00eatre retenue.\nC. L\u2019intim\u00e9 [36] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces plaintes visent uniquement une loi du Parlement. Par cons\u00e9quent, le raisonnement de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Canada Agence du revenu, 2012 CAF 7 (Murphy), selon lequel une plainte visant une loi du Parlement ne relevait pas de la comp\u00e9tence de la Loi, dicte que la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy est directement pertinent et lie le Tribunal, et qu\u2019il ne revient pas au Tribunal d\u2019annuler une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, comme le plaignant souhaite contester l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, il devrait d\u00e9poser une contestation fond\u00e9e sur la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s devant une cour de justice.\n[37] Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soul\u00e8ve de nombreux autres arguments selon lesquels les plaintes ne peuvent pas constituer une preuve prima facie de discrimination, y compris (1) le plaignant tente de revitaliser l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 en faveur des hommes qui existait dans la Loi sur les Indiens avant 1985; (2) la plainte est fond\u00e9e sur une application r\u00e9trospective de la Loi \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement, soit l\u2019\u00e9mancipation d\u2019Andrew Joseph, qui a eu lieu 20 ans avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi, ce qui n\u2019est pas permis; (3) les plaintes ne sont pas fond\u00e9es sur la situation de famille, la race ou l\u2019origine ethnique; (4) le plaignant ne peut pas se fonder sur le traitement cens\u00e9ment discriminatoire d\u2019une autre personne (le grand-p\u00e8re) pour justifier sa propre plainte de discrimination; (5) les plaintes doivent comporter un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de nature arbitraire ou des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de st\u00e9r\u00e9otype, et non une simple distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[38] Subsidiairement encore, si une preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la discrimination \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, les modifications de 1985 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient le produit de plus de 15 ans de consultation aupr\u00e8s des Autochtones, d\u2019\u00e9tudes de comit\u00e9s parlementaires et d\u2019\u00e9laboration par le gouvernement. Le Parlement a modifi\u00e9 l\u2019ancienne loi qui \u00e9tablissait une in\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les sexes et a \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats de toutes les personnes vis\u00e9es par la loi, arrivant ainsi aux dispositions sur l\u2019inscription sans distinction de sexe actuelles. Le fait de d\u00e9vier des dispositions sans distinctions de sexe en adoptant et en revitalisant l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 en faveur des hommes de l\u2019ancienne Loi sur les Indiens constituerait une contrainte excessive. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le fait de d\u00e9vier des normes g\u00e9n\u00e9alogiques utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens afin d\u2019ajouter une troisi\u00e8me ou une quatri\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de personnes dont l\u2019h\u00e9ritage est mixte, comme le demande le plaignant, constituerait aussi une contrainte excessive.\n[39] Cela dit, comme le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi ne permet de fonder une contrainte excessive que sur la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou le co\u00fbt, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, pour justifier une preuve prima facie de discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019expression \u00ab co\u00fbt \u00bb devrait comprendre le co\u00fbt \u00ab social \u00bb et non le simple co\u00fbt financier. Autrement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il devra pr\u00e9senter une justification fond\u00e9e uniquement sur la contrainte excessive financi\u00e8re. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il est r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une justification uniquement fond\u00e9e sur la contrainte financi\u00e8re pour les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, compte tenu de la nature r\u00e9ductrice et d\u00e9shumanisante d\u2019une telle justification et du fait que les facteurs non financiers ont \u00e9t\u00e9 importants et ont eu beaucoup de poids dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration des dispositions. \u00c0 ce sujet, l\u2019intim\u00e9 note qu\u2019une analyse en fonction de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en fonction de la Loi, serait plus propice pour tenir compte des consid\u00e9rations sociales qui ont servi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens.\nV. Les questions en litige [40] Les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en application de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, qui pr\u00e9voit :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture\n[41] Compte tenu de l\u2019article 5 et des positions susmentionn\u00e9es des parties, les questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9es ainsi :\nA. Les plaintes portent-elles sur la prestation de services destin\u00e9s au public au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, ou sont-elles uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi?\nB. Si les plaintes sont uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi, la Loi permet-elle l\u2019instruction de telles plaintes?\n[42] Si les plaintes portent sur la prestation de services, ou si la Loi permet l\u2019instruction de plaintes qui contestent une loi, les questions qu\u2019il resterait \u00e0 trancher seraient :\nA. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination?\nB. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la discrimination prima facie n\u2019a pas eu lieu tel qu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait justifiable au sens de la Loi?\nVI. Analyse A. Les plaintes portent-elles sur la prestation de services destin\u00e9s au public au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, ou sont-elles uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi? Les positions des parties\n[43] Le plaignant est d\u2019avis que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien est un \u00ab service \u00bb. Selon le plaignant, Service Canada affiche \u00ab Inscription des Indiens et listes de bandes \u00bb comme service sur son site Web. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019on peut conclure que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien fournit un avantage ou de l\u2019aide aux Premi\u00e8res Nations. Le plaignant ajoute que les avantages qui d\u00e9coulent du statut d\u2019Indien inscrit sont \u00e9troitement li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette inscription et qu\u2019ils constituent des services en soi (par exemple, les soins de sant\u00e9, le droit \u00e0 l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux terres et les droits de chasse et de p\u00eache).\n[44] La Commission per\u00e7oit aussi l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien comme un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Premi\u00e8rement, elle soutient que le libell\u00e9 et les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents l\u00e9gaux de l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi montrent qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration l\u00e9gale pr\u00e9cisant le contraire, le Parlement veut que la Loi s\u2019applique aux dispositions portant sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens et croit qu\u2019il doit en \u00eatre ainsi. Selon la Commission, la seule fa\u00e7on de donner effet \u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement \u00e0 ce sujet est d\u2019accepter que l\u2019octroi du statut d\u2019Indien inscrit est un service \u00ab destin\u00e9 au public \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. La Commission est d\u2019avis qu\u2019aucun autre article de la Loi ne pourrait raisonnablement \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 appuyer le type de plaintes que le Parlement avait clairement envisag\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 l\u2019ancien article 67 en 1977.\n[45] La Commission fait aussi valoir que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui servent actuellement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si un acte du gouvernement constitue un \u00ab service \u00bb : (i) l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens conf\u00e8re des avantages tangibles et intangibles (y compris la capacit\u00e9 de transmettre le droit au statut \u00e0 son enfant ou \u00e0 son petit-enfant); (ii) ces avantages sont \u00ab offerts \u00bb ou \u00ab mis \u00e0 la disposition \u00bb du public admissible dans le libell\u00e9 m\u00eame de la Loi sur les Indiens et dans les publications du gouvernement accessibles au public; (iii) les personnes qui souhaitent \u00eatre inscrites en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens doivent pr\u00e9senter une demande au Bureau du registraire des Indiens; (iv) la jurisprudence a reconnu que le libell\u00e9 des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de prestations et les actions des minist\u00e8res et organismes gouvernementaux dans l\u2019administration de ces lois peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen \u00e0 titre de \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi; (v) le fait de traiter le r\u00e9gime d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens comme un \u00ab service \u00bb serait compatible avec les d\u00e9cisions d\u2019autres juridictions qui ont conclu que les r\u00e9gimes du gouvernement qui offrent des avantages sont des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne applicables.\n[46] L\u2019intim\u00e9, pour sa part, ne voit pas le droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en application de la Loi sur les Indiens comme un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, bien que le traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription puisse constituer un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, les crit\u00e8res du Parlement permettant de d\u00e9terminer qui a droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au sens de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens ne sont pas un service. Le plaignant ne dit pas que sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment d\u2019autres demandes, ce qui aurait constitu\u00e9 de la discrimination. Les plaintes portent plut\u00f4t sur les param\u00e8tres par lesquels le Parlement a d\u00e9fini la population ayant droit au statut d\u2019Indien. De cette fa\u00e7on, la l\u00e9gislation du Parlement n\u2019est pas un service.\nAnalyse\n[47] Pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien est un service au sens de la Loi, comme le soutiennent le plaignant et la Commission en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il convient de clarifier ce que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 5 \u00ab services [\u2026] destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb signifie. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers, [1996] 1 A.C.S. no 29 (Gould), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 8a) du Yukon Human Rights Act, qui interdit \u00e0 quiconque de faire preuve de discrimination \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019offre ou \u00e0 la fourniture au public de services, de biens ou d\u2019installations \u00bb, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de dispositions analogues de diverses lois canadiennes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, y compris l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. La Cour supr\u00eame \u00e9tablit une analyse en deux temps pour interpr\u00e9ter cet alin\u00e9a, au paragraphe 68 :\nDans un premier temps, il faut d\u00e9terminer en quoi consiste le \u00ab service \u00bb, compte tenu des faits soumis \u00e0 la cour. Une fois qu\u2019on a \u00e9tabli en quoi consiste le \u00ab service \u00bb, il faut, dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, d\u00e9terminer si ce service cr\u00e9e une relation publique entre le fournisseur et l\u2019utilisateur. Pour ce faire, il est indispensable de d\u00e9finir en quoi consiste \u00ab le public \u00bb \u00e0 qui le service est offert, \u00e9tant acquis que cette d\u00e9finition doit \u00eatre d\u2019ordre relationnel et non quantitatif. Pour v\u00e9rifier si le service donne lieu \u00e0 une \u00ab relation publique \u00bb, les crit\u00e8res suivants seront tous pertinents, sans \u00eatre exhaustifs, savoir la s\u00e9lectivit\u00e9 dans la prestation du service, la diversit\u00e9 du public \u00e0 qui il est destin\u00e9, la participation de non-membres, son caract\u00e8re commercial ou non, sa nature intime et son objet. Je tiens \u00e0 souligner qu\u2019aucun de ces crit\u00e8res n\u2019est d\u00e9terminant; par exemple, le simple fait qu\u2019une organisation offre ou fournisse son service de fa\u00e7on exclusive ne met pas n\u00e9cessairement ce service \u00e0 l\u2019abri des lois antidiscriminatoires. Une relation publique doit \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par un examen des crit\u00e8res pertinents en fonction du contexte.\n[48] La port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5 a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus amplement d\u00e9finie r\u00e9cemment par des d\u00e9cisions telles que Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, 2008 CAF 170, 378 N.R. 268 (Watkin), Forward v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 5 (Forward) et Dreaver v. Pankiw, 2009 CHRT 8 (Pankiw), confirm\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Pankiw, 2010 CF 555 (Pankiw CF). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rejette express\u00e9ment l\u2019id\u00e9e que tous les actes du gouvernement rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. La Cour d\u2019appel rejette la conclusion dans la d\u00e9cision Bailey v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), (1980) 1 C.H.R.D.\/193, selon laquelle \u00ab toutes les mesures prises par le gouvernement dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019une fonction pr\u00e9vue par la loi constituent des \"services\" au sens de l\u2019article 5 parce qu\u2019elles sont prises par la \"fonction publique\" pour le bien public \u00bb. (Voir aussi Menghani v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission) (1992), 17 C.H.R.R. D\/236 \u00e0 D\/244\u2014D\/246 et Re Singh, [1989] 1 C.F. 430 (C.A.F.)). La Cour d\u2019appel d\u00e9finit plut\u00f4t l\u2019article 5 comme contemplant \u00ab quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \"offert\" ou \"mis \u00e0 la disposition\" du public \u00bb et qui est le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un processus qui prend place \u00ab dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique \u00bb. La Cour d\u2019appel offre des exemples d\u2019actes du gouvernement qui constituent un service, au paragraphe 28 :\nLes pouvoirs publics peuvent fournir des services pour s\u2019acquitter des fonctions que la loi leur confie. Ainsi, l\u2019Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada offre un service lorsqu\u2019elle communique des d\u00e9cisions anticip\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu; Environnement Canada fournit un service lorsqu\u2019elle publie des bulletins m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques et des rapports sur l\u2019\u00e9tat des routes; Sant\u00e9 Canada offre un service lorsqu\u2019elle incite les Canadiens \u00e0 s\u2019occuper activement de leur sant\u00e9 en s\u2019adonnant davantage \u00e0 l\u2019exercice physique et en s\u2019alimentant mieux; Immigration Canada fournit un service lorsqu\u2019elle informe les immigrants sur la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour devenir un r\u00e9sident canadien. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, ce ne sont pas toutes les interventions gouvernementales qui sont des services.\n[49] Dans Pankiw, le Tribunal a conclu que les bulletins parlementaires (des brochures imprim\u00e9es envoy\u00e9es aux maisons dans une circonscription) envoy\u00e9s par M. Jim Pankiw, d\u00e9put\u00e9 dans le comt\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de Saskatoon Humbolt en 2002-2003 \u00e0 ses \u00e9lecteurs, et qui auraient contenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments discriminatoires, n\u2019\u00e9taient pas un service et n\u2019\u00e9taient donc pas assujettis aux dispositions de la Loi. Le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 5 dans Watkin, mais a pouss\u00e9 plus loin, tenant compte de d\u00e9cisions comme Canada (P.G.) c. McKenna, [1999] 1 C.F. 401 (CA) (McKenna (C.F.)) et Forward, et a conclu qu\u2019un service doit comprendre l\u2019offre d\u2019un avantage ou de l\u2019aide, mais que l\u2019on doit aussi examiner \u00ab si cet avantage ou cette aide faisait partie de la nature essentielle de l\u2019activit\u00e9 \u00bb : Pankiw CF, au paragraphe 42.\n[50] Appliquant cette conclusion aux faits dans Pankiw, le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019objectif et le caract\u00e8re fondamentaux des bulletins parlementaires, qui sont financ\u00e9s par la Chambre des communes, \u00e9taient de permettre aux d\u00e9put\u00e9s de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs besoins en mati\u00e8re de communication politique. Les d\u00e9put\u00e9s, et non les \u00e9lecteurs, \u00e9taient les principaux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des bulletins parlementaires et, par cons\u00e9quent, leur contenu ne constituait pas un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Examinant ensuite la deuxi\u00e8me partie de l\u2019analyse \u00e9tablie dans Gould, le Tribunal a conclu de plus que, m\u00eame si le contexte des bulletins parlementaires constituait un service, il ne prenait pas place dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique, parce que le public n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation des bulletins parlementaires. Le Tribunal a conclu que, bien que la distribution des bulletins parlementaires aux \u00e9lecteurs entra\u00eenait une relation publique et aurait pu constituer un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de la Loi, il n\u2019y avait eu aucune all\u00e9gation selon laquelle cette activit\u00e9 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu violation de la Loi. En contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, concluant que le Tribunal avait ajout\u00e9 des renseignements ou avait clarifi\u00e9 le droit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019article 5, tel que le droit \u00e9tait apr\u00e8s l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin.\n[51] Appliquant ces principes aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal doit donc d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer, en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, ce qui constitue le \u00ab service \u00bb et si la prestation de ce service s\u2019est faite de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire.\n[52] Il n\u2019y a aucune contestation sur ce point. La Commission et le plaignant ont tous les deux clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les plaintes portent sur l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens : voir les arguments du plaignant, lignes 49 \u00e0 51. Pendant l\u2019audience, on a demand\u00e9 au plaignant s\u2019il soutenait que la discrimination avait eu lieu dans le cadre du processus d\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens par les agents d\u2019AADNC. Le registraire des Indiens g\u00e8re la liste des bandes au sens de l\u2019article 11 de la Loi sur les Indiens, il offre des renseignements et il traite les demandes d\u2019inscription, qui seraient tous des services offerts au public. Le plaignant a cependant affirm\u00e9 que cela n\u2019est pas le fondement de ses all\u00e9gations : voir le t\u00e9moignage de Roger Andrews, 15 octobre 2012. La seule pr\u00e9tention du plaignant vise les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles ne lui permettent pas d\u2019obtenir le statut au sens du paragraphe 6(1) en raison de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation de son p\u00e8re (la deuxi\u00e8me plainte), l\u2019emp\u00eachant ainsi de transmettre son statut d\u2019Indien \u00e0 ses enfants, y compris sa fille Michelle Andrews (la premi\u00e8re plainte).\n[53] Ces dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription peuvent-elles donc constituer un \u00ab service \u00bb, parce qu\u2019elles offrent un avantage, au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin? Le plaignant et la Commission soutiennent que c\u2019est le cas. Ils font valoir que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien conf\u00e8re un certain nombre d\u2019avantages tangibles et intangibles, tels que les services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s, l\u2019exon\u00e9ration fiscale pour les biens achet\u00e9s sur la r\u00e9serve et l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re pour les \u00e9tudes post-secondaires, entre autres. La Commission soutient aussi que cette position est appuy\u00e9e par des arr\u00eats tels que Alberta (Affaires autochtones et d\u00e9veloppement du Nord) c. Cunningham, 2011 CSC 37 (Cunningham) et McIvor. L\u2019intim\u00e9, cependant, n\u2019accepte pas cette caract\u00e9risation, soutenant que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien est diff\u00e9rente des autres r\u00e9gimes d\u2019avantages parce qu\u2019elle ressemble beaucoup plus aux avantages obtenus par la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans Forward. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Forward, comme elle d\u00e9finit la relation entre un individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat, l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien ne constitue pas un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de la Loi.\n[54] La conclusion dans Forward qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Murphy, et lie donc le Tribunal, portait sur le concept qu\u2019une attaque directe \u00e0 une loi ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la port\u00e9e de la Loi, parce que l\u2019attaque vise la loi comme telle, et rien d\u2019autre : Forward, au paragraphe 6. La conclusion subs\u00e9quente du membre instructeur Sinclair selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab la citoyennet\u00e9 est un statut distinct accord\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb et que, par cons\u00e9quent, [traduction] \u00ab le fait de qualifier la citoyennet\u00e9 de simple service ne tient pas compte de son r\u00f4le fondamental dans la d\u00e9finition de la relation entre un individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb ne sert qu\u2019\u00e0 appuyer cette premi\u00e8re conclusion. En effet, dans Forward, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que les actes cens\u00e9ment discriminatoires des agents de la citoyennet\u00e9 \u00e9taient \u00e0 l\u2019abri de toute forme d\u2019examen au sens de la Loi, parce qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulaient directement des dispositions de la Loi sur la Citoyennet\u00e9, et non du [traduction] \u00ab statut distinct \u00bb de la citoyennet\u00e9. Si la loi n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 directement contest\u00e9e, les actes discriminatoires des agents de la citoyennet\u00e9 n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen au sens de la Loi du seul fait du [traduction] \u00ab statut distinct \u00bb obtenu par la citoyennet\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait qu\u2019un acte cens\u00e9ment discriminatoire d\u00e9finit [traduction] \u00ab la relation entre un individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance dans l\u2019analyse de l\u2019existence d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[55] Quant au crit\u00e8re dans Watkin, \u00e0 mon avis, le statut d\u2019Indien obtenu par l\u2019inscription conf\u00e8re des avantages tangibles et intangibles au public. En plus des avantages pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s par la Commission et reconnus par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Cunningham et McIvor, je note que le plaignant a aussi soulign\u00e9 la corr\u00e9lation entre l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien et l\u2019obtention du statut de membre d\u2019une bande, ainsi que l\u2019importance culturelle de transmettre le statut d\u2019Indien \u00e0 ses enfants. Il y a sans aucun doute une grande importance et de nombreux avantages li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019obtention du statut d\u2019Indien. Cela dit, en plus de conclure que les activit\u00e9s contest\u00e9es constituent \u00ab quelque chose d\u2019avantageux \u00bb, le crit\u00e8re dans Watkin pr\u00e9cise aussi que cet avantage doit \u00eatre \u00ab offert \u00bb et \u00ab mis \u00e0 la disposition du public \u00bb. Pour tirer cette conclusion, la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould, au paragraphe 55 :\n[\u2026] Une relation publique est donc requise entre le fournisseur du service et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de ce service dans la mesure o\u00f9 le public doit se voir accorder l\u2019acc\u00e8s ou l\u2019admission, ou offrir le service par le fournisseur. La formulation des dispositions a une connotation transitive; ce n\u2019est qu\u2019une fois que le service, le logement, l\u2019installation, etc., passe par le fournisseur et qu\u2019il est mis \u00e0 la disposition du public qu\u2019il est vis\u00e9 par l\u2019interdiction de la discrimination. [\u2026]\n[56] La \u00ab connotation transitive \u00bb tir\u00e9e de la formulation des diverses lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne examin\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi dans le libell\u00e9 \u00ab pour le fournisseur [\u2026] de services \u00bb. En fournissant des avantages tels que les services de sant\u00e9 non assur\u00e9s, le soutien financier et l\u2019exon\u00e9ration fiscale, et en traitant les demandes d\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien, les minist\u00e8res et organismes comme AADNC, Sant\u00e9 Canada et l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada sont tous des fournisseurs de services au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Cependant, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, cela n\u2019est pas l\u2019objet en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce contestent les dispositions m\u00eames de la Loi sur les Indiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, la question \u00e0 laquelle je dois r\u00e9pondre est la suivante : en fournissant ces avantages dans les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien de la Loi sur les Indiens, en d\u2019autres mots, en cr\u00e9ant la loi, le Parlement est-il un fournisseur de service qui met un service \u00e0 la disposition du public? La r\u00e9ponse est non.\n[57] La l\u00e9gislation est l\u2019une des fonctions les plus fondamentales et les plus importantes du Parlement et est de nature sui generis. Cela est confirm\u00e9 par les pouvoirs, les privil\u00e8ges et les immunit\u00e9s que le Parlement et les l\u00e9gislatures poss\u00e8dent afin de garantir leur fonctionnement ad\u00e9quat, qui sont fond\u00e9s dans la Constitution, en vertu du pr\u00e9ambule et de l\u2019article 18 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1867, 30 & 31 Victoria, ch. 3 (la Loi constitutionnelle) et dans le droit l\u00e9gislatif, aux articles 4 et 5 de la Loi sur le Parlement du Canada, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-1 : Telezone Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), (2004), 235 D.L.R. (4th) 719, aux paragraphes 13 \u00e0 17. En effet, la dignit\u00e9, l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et le fonctionnement efficace de la l\u00e9gislature est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge du Parlement qui, lorsqu\u2019il est \u00e9tabli, a droit au statut constitutionnel et est \u00e0 l\u2019abri de tout examen : Harvey c. Nouveau-Brunswick (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), (1996), 137 D.L.R. (4th) 142, [1996] 2 R.C.S. 876; Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, au paragraphe 33 (Vaid). Le fait de mettre l\u2019acte de l\u00e9gislation dans la m\u00eame cat\u00e9gorie que la livraison des bulletins parlementaires, comme dans Pankiw, ou le traitement des demandes de citoyennet\u00e9, comme dans Forward, est fondamentalement probl\u00e9matique et embl\u00e9matique d\u2019une approche qui ne tient pas compte du r\u00f4le sp\u00e9cial que la l\u00e9gislation joue dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En l\u00e9gif\u00e9rant, le Parlement ne fournit pas un service et il n\u2019y a pas de \u00ab connotation transitive \u00bb pour cette fonction. En fait, la l\u00e9gislation remplit un r\u00f4le mandat\u00e9 par la constitution. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que la l\u00e9gislation soit une activit\u00e9 qui puisse \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme prenant place \u00ab dans le cadre d\u2019une relation publique \u00bb (Gould, au paragraphe 16) ou comme cr\u00e9ant \u00ab une relation publique \u00bb (Gould, au paragraphe 68, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) au sens du deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re Gould, le fait de la qualifier de service ne tiendrait pas compte de sa nature sui generis.\n[58] Ce raisonnement trouve appui dans l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois \u00e0 l\u2019expression \u00ab services \u00bb de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Selon le principe moderne d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, il faut lire les termes d\u2019une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur : Elmer A. Driedger, The Construction of Statutes, (Toronto, Butterworths, 1974), \u00e0 la page 67. Dans Forward, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la signification du terme \u00ab services \u00bb \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la r\u00e8gle des mots associ\u00e9s (noscitur a sociis) :\n[L]e l\u00e9gislateur pourrait raisonnablement avoir eu l\u2019intention de donner des indications quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du terme \u00ab services \u00bb de l\u2019article 5 en le pla\u00e7ant avec les termes \u00ab biens \u00bb, \u00ab installations \u00bb et \u00ab moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement \u00bb (noscitur a sociis, \u00ab la r\u00e8gle des mots associ\u00e9s \u00bb). De ce point de vue, il est tr\u00e8s difficile de conclure que l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 est un service ayant des caract\u00e9ristiques semblables aux biens, aux installations ou aux moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement.\n[59] Je crois que cette interpr\u00e9tation est aussi conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objet de la Loi, qui se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe, l\u2019orientation sexuelle, l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l\u2019\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[60] M\u00eame si la l\u00e9gislation ne constitue pas un \u00ab service \u00bb et, par cons\u00e9quent, ne peut pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, cela n\u2019enl\u00e8ve rien \u00e0 l\u2019objectif de la Loi de permettre \u00e0 tous de vivre sans l\u2019entrave de ce qui constitue des \u00ab actes discriminatoires \u00bb. Bien que la Commission soutienne que rien dans cet article ne donne \u00e0 penser qu\u2019un acte pr\u00e9vu par la loi est cens\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen au sens de la Loi, \u00e0 mon avis, rien dans cet article n\u2019appuie cette id\u00e9e non plus. M\u00eame compte tenu de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation large et fonctionnelle attribu\u00e9e aux lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, on ne doit pas attribuer au libell\u00e9 d\u2019une loi une signification que sa construction ne saurait admettre : R. c. Z. (D.A.), [1992] A.C.S. no 80, \u00e0 la page 1042. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019intention du Parlement, j\u2019examinerai la question plus en d\u00e9tail ci\u2011dessous, en r\u00e9ponse aux observations de la Commission portant sur l\u2019article 67 r\u00e9cemment abrog\u00e9 de la Loi. Il suffit de dire ici que je ne crois pas que l\u2019intention du Parlement dans la Loi \u00e9tait de permettre la contestation directe d\u2019une loi.\n[61] Cela dit, il est vrai qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu, par le pass\u00e9, que des lois constituaient des services \u00ab destin\u00e9s au public \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Dans Canada (Attorney General) c. Druken, [1989] 2 C.F. 24 (C.A.) (Druken), les plaignantes, qui \u00e9taient employ\u00e9es dans des entreprises appartenant \u00e0 leurs \u00e9poux, n\u2019ont pas eu droit aux prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi en raison de leur \u00e9tat matrimonial ou de leur situation de famille. Le Tribunal a conclu que le fait de refuser les prestations, en application de la Loi sur l\u2019assistance-ch\u00f4mage de 1971, constituait un refus de fournir des services fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait par cons\u00e9quent de discrimination. Des d\u00e9cisions subs\u00e9quentes comme Gonzalez c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1997] A.C.F. no 790 (Gonzalez), au paragraphe 37, McAllister-Windsor v. Canada (Human Resources Development), [2001] C.H.R.D. No 4 (McAllister-Windsor), au paragraphe 30 et McKenna v. Canada (Department of Secretary of State), [1993] C.H.R.D. No 18 (McKenna), ont confirm\u00e9 le principe que les avantages d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une loi comme la Loi sur l\u2019assistance\u2011ch\u00f4mage et la Loi sur la Citoyennet\u00e9 constituaient un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Cependant, la d\u00e9cision dans McKenna a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un appel, et bien que ni la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, ni la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019aient trait\u00e9 de cette conclusion en particulier, le juge Robertson a fait la remarque incidente suivante, soulevant des questions au sujet de ce principe (Canada (P.G.) c. McKenna, [1999] 1 C.F. 401 (C.A.) (McKenna (C.F.)), aux paragraphes 78 \u00e0 80) :\nBien que j\u2019insiste sur ce point particulier, je ne veux pas donner l\u2019impression que je souscris \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir que l\u2019attribution de la citoyennet\u00e9 constitue un service destin\u00e9 au public au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, et que le Tribunal a donc comp\u00e9tence pour n\u00e9gocier avec le ministre responsable la fa\u00e7on dont les dispositions de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 doivent s\u2019appliquer dans l\u2019avenir. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que ce point particulier n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 repris devant le juge des requ\u00eates ou devant la Cour, je ne me propose pas de l\u2019examiner si ce n\u2019est pour \u00e9carter l\u2019id\u00e9e erron\u00e9e selon laquelle la d\u00e9cision que la Cour a rendue dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Druken, [1989] 2 C.F. 24 (C.A.) \u00e9taye de quelque fa\u00e7on la th\u00e8se voulant que le refus d\u2019attribuer la citoyennet\u00e9 ait pour effet de priver une personne d\u2019un service.\n[\u2026]\n\u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019arr\u00eat Druken n\u2019\u00e9taye pas la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le refus d\u2019accorder des prestations d\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage a pour effet de priver une personne d\u2019un service au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne; [il] montre uniquement que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a conc\u00e9d\u00e9 la chose.\n[62] Le Tribunal a tir\u00e9 une conclusion semblable en 2009 dans Forward. Il a conclu que la seule source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e, soit le refus d\u2019accorder la citoyennet\u00e9 en raison de la filiation, au sens de la Loi sur la Citoyennet\u00e9 de 1977, L.R.C. ch. C-29 (la Loi de 1977), \u00e9tait le libell\u00e9 du texte de loi. En examinant la demande de citoyennet\u00e9, les fonctionnaires avaient appliqu\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux explicites \u00e0 des faits incontest\u00e9s, ni plus, ni moins. Toute contestation du processus d\u2019examen de demande \u00e9tait donc r\u00e9ellement une contestation de la Loi de 1977 (Forward, au paragraphe 38). Se fondant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du juge Robertson de l\u2019arr\u00eat Druken dans McKenna (C.F.), le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019octroi de la citoyennet\u00e9 ne constituait pas un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[63] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette conclusion en 2012 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que, comme la plainte \u00e9tait une attaque directe visant les articles 110.2 et 120.31 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.) et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle visait uniquement la loi en soi, elle ne relevait pas de la port\u00e9e de la Loi. Se fondant sur la remarque incidente du juge O\u2019Reilly dans Wignall c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Imp\u00f4t)), 2003 CF 1280, la Cour d\u2019appel a not\u00e9 qu\u2019une telle attaque ne pouvait \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e que par contestation constitutionnelle, parce que la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte visant une loi du Parlement. La Cour d\u2019appel a not\u00e9 que, malgr\u00e9 la concession du Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans Druken selon laquelle le fait de refuser la prestation d\u2019assurance-emploi constituait un refus de service au sens de la Loi, les faits montraient clairement que la plainte ne visait que les alin\u00e9as 3(2)c) et 4(3)d) de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance\u2011ch\u00f4mage, L.C. 1974-1975-1976, ch. 80, et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4(3)d) du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage, C.R.C. ch. 1576. La Cour a laiss\u00e9 entendre que, si les parties avaient poursuivi ce point, Druken aurait, pour les m\u00eames raisons qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment.\n[64] En rejetant la plainte, l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy ne conclut pas seulement que la loi n\u2019est pas un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, mais il retire aussi de la port\u00e9e de la Loi, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, toute attaque directe \u00e0 une loi. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, que la l\u00e9gislation n\u2019est pas un service au sens de la Loi. Cependant, si le Tribunal accepte qu\u2019il doit suivre Murphy, comme le soutient l\u2019intim\u00e9, alors cet arr\u00eat dispose des plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans leur totalit\u00e9.\nB. Si les plaintes sont uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi, la Loi permet-elle l\u2019instruction de telles plaintes? [65] La Commission reconna\u00eet qu\u2019\u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy r\u00e9pondrait en entier aux plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, qui visent un acte du gouvernement qui \u00e9tait obligatoire en application des dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens. Cependant, la Commission est d\u2019avis que l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy est contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence contraignante de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, qui conclue que les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne priment sur les autres lois incompatibles, qu\u2019elles rendent inop\u00e9rantes. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, une longue lign\u00e9e de jurisprudence dans le r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des droits de la personne avait aussi reconnu ces principes. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal devrait, respectueusement, refuser d\u2019appliquer l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy et devrait plut\u00f4t suivre les directives contraignantes de la Cour supr\u00eame. La Commission soutient aussi que des d\u00e9cisions dans tout le pays ont reconnu la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et la capacit\u00e9 de contester un acte du gouvernement qui est obligatoire en application du libell\u00e9 d\u2019une loi.\n[66] La Commission note aussi que l\u2019intention du Parlement, qui veut que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, est refl\u00e9t\u00e9e dans plusieurs dispositions actuelles de la Loi : 2, 49(5) et 62(1). Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission mentionne aussi l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi, qui, soutient-elle, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour que les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens soient \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen en vertu de la Loi.\n[67] Le plaignant a adopt\u00e9 les arguments de la Commission \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[68] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, les arguments de la Commission invitent le Tribunal \u00e0 commettre une erreur, parce qu\u2019ils sont contraires \u00e0 la doctrine stare decisis et au principe que le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame sur lesquels la Commission s\u2019est fond\u00e9e n\u2019interpr\u00e8tent pas les dispositions pr\u00e9cises de la Loi en question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, soit le paragraphe 40(1) et les articles 5 \u00e0 14.1. En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est d\u2019avis que les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame font des commentaires g\u00e9n\u00e9raux au sujet de la nature des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, dans Murphy, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 le paragraphe 40(1) et les articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi, en tenant compte du contexte complet de la Loi. Comme on demande maintenant au Tribunal d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter ces m\u00eames dispositions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9clare que le Tribunal doit suivre l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy.\n[69] J\u2019examinerai \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le chacun des arguments de la Commission.\n(i) La jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d\u2019autres d\u00e9cisions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales portant sur la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. La position de la Commission\n[70] Conform\u00e9ment aux arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans les affaires Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145 (Heerspink), et Winnipeg School Division No. 1 c. Craton, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 150 (Craton), la Commission soutient que, lorsqu\u2019il existe un conflit entre les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et d\u2019autres lois, la loi en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne gouvernera, \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 quasi-constitutionnel d\u2019une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et qu\u2019elle l\u2019emportera sur les lois incompatibles, \u00e0 moins que le l\u00e9gislateur ait clairement pr\u00e9vu le contraire en des termes pr\u00e9cis et sans \u00e9quivoque. Cette primaut\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne signifie, selon la Commission, que la loi incompatible est alors consid\u00e9r\u00e9e inop\u00e9rante, comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans des arr\u00eats comme Tranchemontagne c. Ontario (Directeur du programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicap\u00e9es), 2006 CSC 14 (Tranchemontagne), et Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Communaut\u00e9 urbaine de Montr\u00e9al, 2004 CSC 30 (Larocque).\n[71] La Commission soutient qu\u2019avant l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, un long courant jurisprudentiel dans le r\u00e9gime f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a reconnu que la Loi primait sur d\u2019autres lois incompatibles, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9tablis dans les affaires Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne. \u00c0 ce sujet, la Commission se fonde sur les d\u00e9cisions suivantes : Druken; Gonzalez; McAllister-Windsor; Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (Uzoaba); les motifs dissidents des juges Dickson et Lamer dans Bhinder c. CN, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 561 (Bhinder); et les motifs dissidents des juges McLachlin et L\u2019Heureux-Dub\u00e9 dans Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 RCS 854 (Cooper).\n[72] Dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission soutient que le Tribunal est aux prises avec deux courants jurisprudentiels contradictoires d\u2019instances sup\u00e9rieures : (i) la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, qui d\u00e9clare qu\u2019en l\u2019absence d\u2019une d\u00e9claration claire du contraire dans la loi, les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne rendent inop\u00e9rantes les lois incompatibles; (ii) l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui tire la conclusion oppos\u00e9e. Selon le principe de stare decisis, la Commission fait valoir que le Tribunal doit suivre les principes \u00e9tablis par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\nAnalyse\n[73] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui portait sur la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 24 mai 2013, le membre instructeur Ed Lustig a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes de Jeremy et Mardy Matson et de Melody Schneider : Matson et al c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 13, (Matson). Les Matson et Mme Schneider, qui sont fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, soutenaient qu\u2019en raison de leur h\u00e9ritage Indien matrilin\u00e9aire, par lequel ils ont eu droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au sens du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment d\u2019autres Indiens dont l\u2019h\u00e9ritage \u00e9tait patrilin\u00e9aire et qui ont par cons\u00e9quent obtenu le statut d\u2019Indien au sens du paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Ils faisaient valoir que les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, appliqu\u00e9es \u00e0 leur situation, constituaient de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, la situation de famille, la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[74] D\u2019une fa\u00e7on semblable \u00e0 M. Andrews en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les Matsons et Mme Schneider soutenaient que l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien en application de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9tait un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi et qu\u2019elle relevait par cons\u00e9quent de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Bien que la Commission et les plaignants dans Matson n\u2019aient pas reconnu que les plaintes constituaient uniquement une contestation directe d\u2019une loi, le Tribunal a conclu que c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas : Matson, au paragraphe 60. Bien que la d\u00e9cision Matson ne traite pas de la question de l\u2019\u00e9mancipation et de ses cons\u00e9quences, les questions juridiques soulev\u00e9es sont les m\u00eames que celles en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[75] La Commission a aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Matson. Ses observations au sujet de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne telle qu\u2019elle est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et les incoh\u00e9rences all\u00e9gu\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy \u00e9taient sensiblement les m\u00eames que celles qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : voir Matson, aux paragraphes 30 \u00e0 33. Dans Matson, le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces observations. Dans une analyse de treize pages, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9, une \u00e0 une, chacun des arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada portant sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sur lesquels les plaignants et la Commission se fondaient, notamment Heerspink, Craton, CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 RCS 114 (Action Travail des Femmes), Andrews c. Law Society of British Columbia [1989] 1 RCS 143 (Andrews), Larocque et Tranchemontagne : Matson, aux paragraphes 66 \u00e0 91.\n[76] Le Tribunal a conclu cette analyse ainsi :\n[traduction]\n[92] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne \u00e9tayent, selon moi, la pr\u00e9tention des plaignants et de la Commission, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne peut rendre inop\u00e9rante une loi qui est en conflit avec elle. Mais cela ne veut pas dire que la Loi autorise les plaignants \u00e0 contester le libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, sauf s\u2019il existe un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\n[93] Il n\u2019y a, dans ces arr\u00eats, aucun commentaire de la Cour supr\u00eame qui indique que la primaut\u00e9 d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de contester un texte de loi en vertu d\u2019une loi sur les droits de la personne. Le fondement du conflit entre deux lois dans les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton et Larocque \u00e9tait r\u00e9dig\u00e9 sous la forme d\u2019une plainte de \u00ab discrimination \u00bb, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de la loi sur les droits de la personne applicable dans ces arr\u00eats. Les plaintes elles-m\u00eames n\u2019\u00e9taient pas une contestation du libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois.\n[94] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne sont en fait compatibles avec la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019a rendue la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Murphy, en ce sens que cette derni\u00e8re a exig\u00e9 qu\u2019il y ait fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, pour que, dans cette affaire, il existe une plainte valide.\n[77] Je ne propose pas de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette analyse de nouveau en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 ces d\u00e9cisions, ainsi que les motifs du Tribunal, en d\u00e9tail et je partage l\u2019avis selon lequel la jurisprudence susmentionn\u00e9e de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy ne sont pas en contradiction. Je reconnais que les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, y compris la Loi, peuvent rendre inop\u00e9rantes d\u2019autres lois incompatibles, suivant les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne, appuy\u00e9s par l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes. Cependant, cela n\u2019emp\u00eache pas qu\u2019il doit exister un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi, donnant ainsi comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la plainte, comme la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a exprim\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy.\n[78] Contrairement aux observations de la Commission, ce point de vue prend aussi appui dans un long courant jurisprudentiel f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 Murphy. Comme je l\u2019ai expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail dans mon analyse portant sur la signification de \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, les affaires Druken, Gonzalez et McAllister-Windsor portaient sur le principe selon lequel les avantages fournis par la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage et la Loi sur la Citoyennet\u00e9 constituaient un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Ces d\u00e9cisions, avec Gould, Watkin, Pankiw, McKenna et Forward, font partie de l\u2019\u00e9volution de la jurisprudence qui a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Bien que l\u2019expression \u00ab service \u00bb ait pu \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e diff\u00e9remment dans les affaires Druken, Gonzalez et McAllister-Windsor que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que ces d\u00e9cisions renoncent \u00e0 l\u2019exigence juridique selon laquelle le Tribunal doit conclure qu\u2019il y a eu \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens de la Loi.\n[79] La Commission s\u2019est aussi fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9cision Uzoaba et sur les motifs dissidents dans Bhinder et Cooper comme preuve de la capacit\u00e9 de la Loi de rendre inop\u00e9rantes des lois, comme la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique et le Code canadien du travail, lorsque certaines dispositions entraient en conflit avec la Loi. Le Tribunal a aussi trait\u00e9 cet argument dans la d\u00e9cision Matson et, comme le membre instructeur Lustig, je suis d\u2019avis que, bien que ces affaires confirment la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi lorsqu\u2019elle entre en conflit avec d\u2019autres lois, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne, aucune de ces affaires ne traite de la question de savoir si l\u2019on peut contester une loi \u00e0 titre de \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu de la Loi : Matson, aux paragraphes 114 et 116 \u00e0 118.\n[80] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne peux pas souscrire \u00e0 la caract\u00e9risation que la Commission fait de la question, soit qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question de deux lignes contradictoires de jurisprudence d\u2019instances sup\u00e9rieures. Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je ne crois pas que l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy contredit la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ou la jurisprudence pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales portant sur les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[81] Les arr\u00eats Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne doivent aussi \u00eatre pris en contexte avec d\u2019autres arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada comme Alberta c. Hutterian Bretheren of Wilson Colony, 2009 CSC 37 (Hutterian Bretheren). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, la juge en chef McLachlin \u00e9labore sur la distinction entre l\u2019analyse de l\u2019accommodement raisonnable \u00e0 effectuer lorsque l\u2019on applique les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et l\u2019analyse de la justification en fonction de l\u2019article premier qui s\u2019applique \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation selon laquelle une loi enfreint la Charte. Ce faisant, elle explique pourquoi, lorsque la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une loi est en jeu, l\u2019approche appropri\u00e9e est celle d\u2019une analyse de l\u2019article premier au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Oakes et un examen de l\u2019atteinte minimale (voir R. c. Oakes, [1986] 1 R.C.S. 103) :\n[68] L\u2019atteinte minimale et l\u2019accommodement raisonnable sont distincts sur le plan conceptuel. L\u2019accommodement raisonnable est un concept qui d\u00e9coule de la l\u00e9gislation et de la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un processus dynamique par lequel les parties \u2013 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un employeur et un employ\u00e9 \u2013 adaptent les modalit\u00e9s de leur relation aux exigences de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, jusqu\u2019au point o\u00f9 il en r\u00e9sulterait une contrainte excessive pour la partie tenue de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Dans Multani, les juges Deschamps et Abella ont expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLe processus impos\u00e9 par l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement raisonnable tient compte des circonstances pr\u00e9cises dans lesquelles les int\u00e9ress\u00e9s doivent \u00e9voluer et laisse place \u00e0 la discussion entre ces derniers. Cette concertation leur permet de se rapprocher et de trouver un terrain d\u2019entente adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 leurs propres besoins. [par. 131]\n[69] Il existe une relation tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente entre le l\u00e9gislateur et les personnes assujetties \u00e0 ses mesures l\u00e9gislatives. De par leur nature, les mesures l\u00e9gislatives d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne sont pas adapt\u00e9es aux besoins particuliers de chacun. Le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019a ni le pouvoir ni l\u2019obligation en droit de prendre des d\u00e9cisions aussi personnalis\u00e9es et, dans bien des cas, il ne conna\u00eet pas \u00e0 l\u2019avance le risque qu\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative porte atteinte aux droits garantis par la Charte. On ne peut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il adapte les mesures l\u00e9gislatives \u00e0 toute \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 toute croyance religieuse sinc\u00e8re. Les mesures l\u00e9gislatives d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ne visent pas uniquement les plaignants, mais l\u2019ensemble de la population. L\u2019ensemble du contexte social dans lequel s\u2019applique la mesure l\u00e9gislative doit \u00eatre pris en compte dans l\u2019analyse de la justification requise par l\u2019article premier. La constitutionnalit\u00e9 d\u2019une mesure l\u00e9gislative au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte d\u00e9pend, non pas de la question de savoir si elle r\u00e9pond aux besoins de chacun des plaignants, mais plut\u00f4t de celle de savoir si la restriction aux droits garantis par la Charte vise un objectif important et si l\u2019effet global de cette restriction est proportionn\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il ne fasse aucun doute que l\u2019effet de la mesure l\u00e9gislative sur les plaignants constitue un facteur important dont le tribunal doit tenir compte pour d\u00e9cider si la violation est justifi\u00e9e, le tribunal doit avant tout prendre en consid\u00e9ration l\u2019ensemble de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Il doit se demander si la contravention \u00e0 la Charte peut se justifier dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique, et non s\u2019il est possible d\u2019envisager un am\u00e9nagement plus avantageux pour un plaignant en particulier.\n[70] De m\u00eame, la \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb, notion essentielle de l\u2019accommodement raisonnable, ne s\u2019applique pas facilement \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislature qui adopte les mesures l\u00e9gislatives. Dans le contexte des droits de la personne, la contrainte est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme excessive si elle menace la viabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019entreprise tenue de s\u2019adapter au droit. Le degr\u00e9 de contrainte peut souvent se traduire en termes p\u00e9cuniaires. En revanche, il est difficile d\u2019appliquer la notion de contrainte excessive en ces termes \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation ou \u00e0 la non-r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objectif l\u00e9gislatif, surtout quand il s\u2019agit (comme en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce) d\u2019un objectif de pr\u00e9vention. Bien qu\u2019il soit possible de donner \u00e0 la notion de \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb une interpr\u00e9tation large qui englobe la contrainte d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 d\u2019atteindre un objectif gouvernemental urgent, une telle interpr\u00e9tation att\u00e9nue cette notion. Plut\u00f4t que d\u2019essayer d\u2019adapter la notion de \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb au contexte de l\u2019article premier de la Charte, il est pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de parler d\u2019atteinte minimale et de proportionnalit\u00e9 des effets.\n[82] Compte tenu des faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si je suis l\u2019argument du plaignant et de la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit justifier toute discrimination d\u00e9coulant de la fa\u00e7on dont le Parlement a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le statut d\u2019Indien dans la Loi sur les Indiens en fonction du crit\u00e8re du motif justifiable fond\u00e9 sur la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et le co\u00fbt, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi. Comme ni la sant\u00e9, ni la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ne font partie des facteurs dont le Parlement a tenu compte lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9dict\u00e9 l\u2019article 7 et les paragraphes 6(1) et 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens, le co\u00fbt reste la seule fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut d\u00e9montrer que le fait d\u2019\u00e9largir l\u2019inscription aux petits-enfants des Indiens dont le statut a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tabli en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d), comme les plaignants et la Commission le demandent, constituerait une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb.\n[83] Pour qu\u2019il puisse le faire ad\u00e9quatement, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les \u00ab co\u00fbts \u00bb doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 inclure les \u00ab co\u00fbts sociaux \u00bb. Ce n\u2019est qu\u2019alors que le Tribunal pourra examiner la justification de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au sujet de la loi cens\u00e9ment discriminatoire, y compris : la norme de la neutralit\u00e9 de sexe derri\u00e8re les modifications de 1985 \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens du projet de loi C-31, le r\u00f4le du Parlement dans la d\u00e9finition d\u2019une population qui a une relation historique avec la Couronne, et les r\u00e9percussions sur la structure sociale, politique, \u00e9conomique et culturelle des bandes d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une augmentation de la population \u00ab inscrite \u00bb.\n[84] \u00c0 mon avis, peu importe si l\u2019on peut, dans certaines circonstances, inclure dans les \u00ab co\u00fbts \u00bb les \u00ab co\u00fbts sociaux \u00bb afin qu\u2019ils constituent une \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb au sens de la Loi, le fait d\u2019\u00e9tirer la notion de la \u00ab contrainte excessive \u00bb afin d\u2019y inclure les \u00e9l\u00e9ments susmentionn\u00e9s dont le Parlement a tenu compte lorsqu\u2019il a modifi\u00e9 la Loi sur les Indiens \u00ab att\u00e9nue cette notion \u00bb, comme la juge McLachlin l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Hutterian Bretheren, au paragraphe 70. En fait, ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments r\u00e9pondent mieux \u00e0 la question de savoir si la violation all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est justifiable dans une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre et d\u00e9mocratique au sens du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019article premier de la Charte. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Hutterian Bretheren dans sa conclusion sur le sujet :\n[\u2026] Le gouvernement peut justifier la mesure l\u00e9gislative, non pas en d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019il l\u2019a adapt\u00e9e aux besoins du plaignant, mais en \u00e9tablissant qu\u2019elle a un lien rationnel avec un objectif urgent et r\u00e9el, qu\u2019elle porte le moins possible atteinte au droit et que son effet est proportionn\u00e9. [Paragraphe 71]\nIl est \u00e9vident que le crit\u00e8re pour la contrainte excessive ne donne pas au Parlement le moyen ad\u00e9quat de se d\u00e9fendre dans une contestation de sa loi.\n[85] Cela ne fait que confirmer la conclusion que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9e, soit que, bien que la Cour supr\u00eame ait confirm\u00e9 la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, ce principe s\u2019applique \u00e0 un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens de la Loi, qui n\u2019existe pas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les contestations directes d\u2019une loi, comme le demandent le plaignant et la Commission en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, doivent, comme il l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans Murphy et d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans Hutterian Bretheren, \u00eatre obtenues dans le cadre d\u2019une contestation constitutionnelle.\n[86] Il est utile de prendre un moment pour donner des exemples de d\u00e9cisions o\u00f9 une incompatibilit\u00e9 ou un conflit entre la Loi et une autre loi a entra\u00een\u00e9 l\u2019application du principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et o\u00f9 il n\u2019existait pas de contestation directe de la loi, qui aurait exig\u00e9 l\u2019application de la Charte. Car, si mon raisonnement annule le fondement de ce principe, reconnu dans la jurisprudence de la Cour supr\u00eame comme Heerspink, Craton, Larocque et Tranchemontagne, alors la Cour supr\u00eame se sera prononc\u00e9e inutilement, et mon raisonnement est certainement vici\u00e9.\n[87] L\u2019un de ces exemples se trouve dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Franke v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [1998] C.H.R.D. No. 3 (Franke). Dans cette affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutenait que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 9 de la Loi sur la responsabilit\u00e9 civile de l\u2019\u00c9tat et le contentieux administratif, L.R.C. 1985, ch. C-50 (la LRCECA), et \u00e0 l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-6 (la LP), le Tribunal ne pouvait pas accorder des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour perte \u00e9conomique \u00e0 la plaignante, parce qu\u2019elle recevait une pension du minist\u00e8re des Anciens combattants pour cette m\u00eame perte. Le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il y avait un conflit entre ces dispositions et les dispositions portant sur le redressement dans la Loi. Se fondant sur Heerspink, Craton, Action Travail des Femmes, Druken et Uzoaba, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et a confirm\u00e9 la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi, notant que, comme le l\u00e9gislateur n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli le contraire, la Loi primait sur les dispositions de la LRCECA et de la LP, et que, par cons\u00e9quent, des dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats pour perte \u00e9conomique pouvaient \u00eatre accord\u00e9s : Franke, aux paragraphes 644 \u00e0 678.\n[88] Dans Eyerley v. Seaspan International Ltd., [2000] C.H.R.D. No. 14 (Eyerley), l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en rejet, au motif que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte, parce que la Worker\u2019s Compensation Board de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le dossier de M. Eyerley et que la Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, ch. 492, de la Colombie\u2011Britannique comprenait une clause privative. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate, concluant que, compte tenu de la nature sp\u00e9ciale des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, il ne croyait pas que les clauses privatives de la Worker\u2019s Compensation Act avaient pour effet d\u2019emp\u00eacher le Tribunal d\u2019exercer sa comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9vue par la Loi : Eyerley, aux paragraphes 27 \u00e0 37.\n[89] Dans Morten c. Air Canada, 2009 TCDP 3 (Morten), r\u00e9vis\u00e9e pour d\u2019autres motifs dans Canada (Office des transports du Canada) c. Morten, 2010 CF 1008, r\u00e9vis\u00e9e dans Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Office des transports du Canada), 2011 CAF 332, Air Canada a soutenu que le Tribunal devrait se limiter \u00e0 ordonner un redressement mon\u00e9taire, parce que l\u2019article 172 de la Loi sur les transports au Canada, L.C. 1996, ch. 10 (la LTC) conf\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019Office des transports du Canada le pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un obstacle abusif \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9 de personnes d\u00e9ficientes et, au besoin, d\u2019ordonner des mesures correctives. Se fondant sur Heerspink, Craton et Vaid, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 l\u2019argument et, tirant une conclusion en faveur du plaignant, a impos\u00e9 diverses mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques importantes, en plus d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire pour pr\u00e9judice moral : Morten, aux paragraphes 189 \u00e0 218.\n[90] Dans Douglas c. SLH Transport Inc., 2010 TCDP 1 (Douglas), l\u2019intim\u00e9 a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans le sixi\u00e8me mois d\u2019un cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical justifi\u00e9 en attente d\u2019une chirurgie au genou droit. Comme le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il y avait une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu, dans le cadre de sa justification de la discrimination, que le paragraphe 239(1) du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. 1985, ch. L-2 (le Code), lui permettait de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant apr\u00e8s que douze semaines se soient \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis le d\u00e9but de son cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical. Le Tribunal a conclu que, bien que le Code interdisait \u00e0 un employeur de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical pour une blessure non li\u00e9e au travail avant que douze semaines se soient \u00e9coul\u00e9es s\u2019il avait accumul\u00e9 trois ans de service continu, cela ne permettait pas aux employeurs d\u2019agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers des employ\u00e9s en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. Le Tribunal a conclu que, compte tenu de la nature quasi\u2011constitutionnelle de la Loi reconnue dans Heerspink, Craton, Uzoaba et Vaid, la Loi primait sur le Code dans cette affaire. Le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas fourni d\u2019explication ou de justification raisonnable pour la discrimination dont il avait fait preuve lorsqu\u2019il a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant, et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la plainte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e : Douglas, aux paragraphes 69 \u00e0 71.\n[91] La d\u00e9cision Uzoaba est un autre exemple d\u2019affaire o\u00f9 le Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9 le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sans directement contester une autre loi. Dans le cadre des mesures de redressement, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que le plaignant soit r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans des fonctions deux niveaux plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s que le niveau qu\u2019il occupait lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. En contr\u00f4le judiciaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que ce type de redressement \u00e9tait interdit par la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P\u201133, qui \u00e9tablit un r\u00e9gime en fonction duquel les promotions sont fond\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite et que le Tribunal ne pouvait pas passer outre ce r\u00e9gime. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 cet argument, appliquant le principe de la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi ainsi :\nJe pense que le principe de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance doit s\u2019appliquer en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour permettre \u00e0 un tribunal des droits de la personne d\u2019ordonner l\u2019octroi d\u2019une promotion qui, selon lui, a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e pour des motifs discriminatoires, en violation de la Loi. En d\u2019autres termes, la comp\u00e9tence de la Commission de la fonction publique et la proc\u00e9dure qui doit normalement \u00eatre suivie pour l\u2019octroi des promotions au sein de la fonction publique n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance dans ces rares cas o\u00f9 des promotions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es pour des motifs discriminatoires et o\u00f9 un tribunal, exer\u00e7ant la comp\u00e9tence qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9e par la Loi, ordonne qu\u2019une promotion soit accord\u00e9e \u00e0 une personne afin de corriger les effets de l\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019employeur. [Paragraphe 20]\n[92] Dans toutes ces affaires, le Tribunal a relev\u00e9 l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire, asseyant ainsi la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Saisi d\u2019un conflit entre la Loi et une autre loi, le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur des arr\u00eats tels que Heerspink et Craton et a confirm\u00e9 le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Dans aucun de ces exemples, le Tribunal n\u2019a tent\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser la Loi pour invalider la disposition incompatible de la fa\u00e7on dont on le ferait avec la Charte. Le Tribunal a simplement conclu que la disposition en litige ne pouvait pas s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant ainsi l\u2019application de la disposition de la Loi. \u00c0 mon avis, c\u2019est dans cette distinction que se trouve l\u2019essence v\u00e9ritable de la signification de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n(ii) La jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne provenant d\u2019ailleurs au pays au sujet de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne [93] La Commission soutient que, dans les cas o\u00f9 cela est possible, les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne du Canada devraient \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on constante, compte tenu de leurs similitudes g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, de leur statut quasi\u2011constitutionnel et de leur objectif commun de pr\u00e9venir la discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour examiner si la Loi permet le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes qui contestent le libell\u00e9 de lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, la Commission fait valoir qu\u2019il est aussi utile d\u2019examiner la jurisprudence d\u2019autres juridictions du Canada. La Commission soutient que, dans ces affaires, les d\u00e9cideurs ont suivi le courant jurisprudentiel f\u00e9d\u00e9ral d\u2019arr\u00eats comme Heerspink, Craton, Larocque, Tranchemontagne et Druken et ont accept\u00e9 que (i) les mesures prises par les agents du gouvernement conform\u00e9ment au libell\u00e9 contraignant d\u2019une loi peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de \u00ab services \u00bb dans le cadre d\u2019un examen en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, (ii) les lois quasi\u2011constitutionnelles en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne peuvent servir \u00e0 rendre inop\u00e9rantes des lois incompatibles et, par cons\u00e9quent, redresser leurs r\u00e9percussions discriminatoires. La Commission renvoie le Tribunal aux d\u00e9cisions suivantes : Ontario (Disability Support Program) v. Tranchemontagne, 2010 ONCA 593 (Tranchemontagne (ONCA)); Hendershott v. Ontario (Community and Social Services), 2011 HRTO 482 (Hendershott); Ivancicevic v. Ontario (Consumer Services), 2011 HRTO 1714 (Ivancicevic); XY v. Ontario (Government and Consumer Services), 2012 HRTO 726 (XY); Gwinner v. Alberta (Human Resources and Employment), 2002 ABQB 685 (Gwinner); Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission) v. Saskatchewan (Department of Social Services), 1988 CanLII 212 (C.A. Sask) (Chambers); Saskatchewan (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Saskatchewan (Human Rights Commission), 1999 CanLII 12368 (C.A. Sask) (Wiebe); Human Rights Commission v. Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission, 2005 NLCA 61 (Nfld HRC); Neubauer v. British Columbia (Ministry of Human Resources), 2005 BCHRT 239 (Neubauer); et A.A. v. New Brunswick (Department of Family and Community Services), [2004] N.B.H.R.B.I.D. No. 4 (QL) (AA).\n[94] Il s\u2019agit une fois de plus des m\u00eames arguments qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Matson et que le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9s aux paragraphes 121 \u00e0 126 de sa d\u00e9cision. Je ne crois pas que ces d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9futent la conclusion selon laquelle un \u00ab service \u00bb doit exister, peu importe la nature quasi-constitutionnelle des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. En effet, \u00e0 l\u2019exception peut-\u00eatre de la d\u00e9cision Gwinner, qui ne traite pas de la question de l\u2019existence d\u2019un service dans les circonstances de l\u2019affaire (et qui, pour cette m\u00eame raison, n\u2019aide pas le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce), toutes ces d\u00e9cisions tirent une conclusion au sujet de l\u2019existence d\u2019un service. Bien que, dans certaines d\u00e9cisions, il puisse avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu implicitement (Hendershott, aux paragraphes 69 \u00e0 70 et 79; Neubauer, au paragraphe 61; Tranchemontagne, au paragraphe 50) ou explicitement (AA, au paragraphe 49; Ivancicevic, au paragraphe 151; XY, aux paragraphes 85 \u00e0 87), qu\u2019une loi est un service et peut dont \u00eatre directement contest\u00e9e en vertu des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, j\u2019arrive \u00e0 une conclusion diff\u00e9rente, qui est fond\u00e9e sur la jurisprudence des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. Je note que, bien que ces d\u00e9cisions puissent avoir un effet persuasif, elles n\u2019ont aucune autorit\u00e9 et ne lient pas le Tribunal.\n(iii) Les dispositions actuelles de la Loi [95] Selon la Commission, le principe selon lequel des plaintes peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au sujet d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales est refl\u00e9t\u00e9 dans les articles 49(5) et 62(1) de la Loi. Le paragraphe 49(5) de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nDans le cas o\u00f9 la plainte met en cause la compatibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition d\u2019une autre loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou de ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application avec la pr\u00e9sente loi ou ses r\u00e8glements d\u2019application, le membre instructeur ou celui qui pr\u00e9side l\u2019instruction, lorsqu\u2019elle est coll\u00e9giale, doit \u00eatre membre du barreau d\u2019une province ou de la Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec.\n[96] Comme le paragraphe 49(5) exige que les plaintes portant sur des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales incompatibles soient instruites par un membre instructeur membre du barreau d\u2019une province ou de la Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec, la Commission est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il d\u00e9montre que le Parlement est d\u2019avis que de telles plaintes peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et tranch\u00e9es sur le fond. La Commission soutient aussi que les proc\u00e9dures ayant entra\u00een\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9diction du paragraphe 49(5) contiennent de nombreux commentaires qui d\u00e9montrent que le gouvernement reconna\u00eet et accepte que la Loi s\u2019applique au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a raison en soutenant que la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, alors la Commission soutient que le paragraphe 49(5) n\u2019a plus aucun sens, ce qui ne peut pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 du Parlement.\n[97] Cet argument a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal dans Matson. Je note, comme le Tribunal dans cette affaire, que le paragraphe 49(5) de la Loi porte sur des incompatibilit\u00e9s entre la Loi et d\u2019autres lois, et ne suppose pas la capacit\u00e9 de la Loi de directement contester une loi. Cet article peut tr\u00e8s bien reconna\u00eetre la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi lorsqu\u2019elle entre en conflit avec d\u2019autres lois, cependant, j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni de nombreux exemples d\u2019instances (voir paragraphes 86 \u00e0 91) o\u00f9 la primaut\u00e9 s\u2019applique et o\u00f9 il n\u2019y a pourtant aucune contestation d\u2019une autre loi. Ce paragraphe ne modifie en rien ce raisonnement.\n[98] Je souscris aussi \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du Tribunal dans Matson au sujet de l\u2019objet du paragraphe 49(5) de la Loi. Le Tribunal a conclu que les passages des proc\u00e9dures du Parlement menant \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article sur lequel la Commission se fonde montraient que l\u2019intention sous-jacente \u00e9tait de garantir que des avocats trancheraient les questions d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 des lois. Comme les affaires de cette nature pourraient \u00eatre l\u00e9galistes et complexes, cette exigence visait \u00e0 faciliter une r\u00e9solution efficace et rapide. Cette interpr\u00e9tation est aussi confirm\u00e9e lorsque l\u2019on examine le paragraphe 49(5) dans le contexte des autres paragraphes de l\u2019article 49, qui portent sur les \u00e9tapes proc\u00e9durales \u00e0 suivre apr\u00e8s le renvoi d\u2019une plainte au Tribunal par la Commission. Cela comprend, au paragraphe 49(2), la capacit\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sident de d\u00e9signer trois membres pour les affaires complexes, ce qui, une fois de plus, vise \u00e0 garantir que le processus est efficace et rapide : Matson, au paragraphe 131.\n[99] J\u2019examinerai maintenant le paragraphe 62(1) de la Loi, qui est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\nLa pr\u00e9sente partie et les parties I et II ne s\u2019appliquent, ni directement ni indirectement, aux r\u00e9gimes ou caisses de retraite constitu\u00e9s par une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ant\u00e9rieure au 1er mars 1978.\nLa Commission soutient que cette disposition pr\u00e9voit ce que les arr\u00eats de la Cour supr\u00eame ont toujours permis : une exception pr\u00e9vue dans la loi \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne priment. Selon la Commission, sans cette exception, la Loi se serait appliqu\u00e9e aux dispositions discriminatoires des lois sur les pensions ou les caisses de retraite f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et les aurait affect\u00e9es. La Commission fait valoir qu\u2019un examen des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents l\u00e9gaux du paragraphe 62(1) confirme cet argument. Une fois de plus, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a raison en soutenant que la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, alors la Commission soutient que le paragraphe 62(1) n\u2019a plus aucun sens, ce qui ne peut pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 du Parlement.\n[100] Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a conclu dans Matson, l\u2019argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la Commission, une fois de plus, confond le principe de la primaut\u00e9 des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avec une contestation directe d\u2019une loi. Le paragraphe 62(1) prouve la primaut\u00e9 de la Loi, ce que, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le paragraphe n\u2019enl\u00e8ve aucunement l\u2019exigence l\u00e9gale de prouver l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi. En effet, selon le paragraphe 40(1) de la Loi, une personne peut d\u00e9poser une plainte \u00e0 la Commission si elle a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019une personne a commis un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb, et l\u2019article 39 d\u00e9finit un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb comme un acte vis\u00e9 aux articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la Loi : Matson, aux paragraphes 128 et 132 \u00e0 135.\n(iv) L\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi [101] Dans la m\u00eame veine que son argument au sujet du paragraphe 62(1), la Commission souligne le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi pour prouver que le Parlement avait l\u2019intention de permettre que la Loi s\u2019applique aux dispositions discriminatoires d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. L\u2019ancien article 67 de la Loi, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 en 2008 (Projet de loi C-21, Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, 2e sess., 39e l\u00e9g., 2008), pr\u00e9voyait :\nLa pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\nComme pour le paragraphe 62(1), la Commission soutient que l\u2019ancien article 67 servait d\u2019exception l\u00e9gale au principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral selon lequel les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne priment. Sans l\u2019exception, la Commission soutient que la Loi se serait appliqu\u00e9e aux dispositions discriminatoires de la Loi sur les Indiens et les aurait affect\u00e9es. Une fois de plus, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a raison en soutenant que la Loi ne s\u2019applique pas au libell\u00e9 d\u2019autres lois, alors la Commission soutient que le paragraphe 67 n\u2019avait aucun sens ni effet pendant sa dur\u00e9e de vie, ce qui ne peut pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 du Parlement. Selon la Commission, le contexte historique de l\u2019article 67 montre qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 afin de placer les dispositions sur l\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen en application de la Loi. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission est d\u2019avis qu\u2019en abrogeant l\u2019article 67 en 2008, le Parlement avait l\u2019intention d\u2019ouvrir la porte aux plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne visant des aspects discriminatoires de ces m\u00eames dispositions.\n[102] La Commission se fonde sur diverses d\u00e9clarations du gouvernement, certaines du ministre de la Justice, et sur des notes de service et des notes pr\u00e9paratoires, qui prouvent que, lorsque le paragraphe 63(2) de la Loi (qui est ensuite devenu l\u2019article 67) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1970, les responsables du gouvernement avaient compris que l\u2019intention du Parlement derri\u00e8re cette disposition \u00e9tait d\u2019emp\u00eacher le Tribunal de conclure que des dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9taient discriminatoires. J\u2019accepte que cette preuve est convaincante et que le Parlement a pu craindre un examen de la Loi sur les Indiens par la Loi, et qu\u2019il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019en garantir la protection en \u00e9dictant l\u2019article 67. Ce faisant, le Parlement aurait effectivement implicitement suppos\u00e9 que la Loi permettait de contester d\u2019autres lois. J\u2019accepte aussi que, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal comme Druken et McAllister\u2011Windsor, ainsi que de la d\u00e9cision Gonzalez de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, en l\u2019absence de l\u2019article 67, il existait effectivement un risque que le Tribunal soit saisi d\u2019un examen de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[103] Cela dit, pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, ces affaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es en fonction d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, qui ne refl\u00e8te plus le mode de pens\u00e9e actuel. De plus, bien que l\u2019article 67 refl\u00e8te l\u2019intention du Parlement d\u2019interdire l\u2019examen de la Loi sur les Indiens en vertu de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Charte, cette preuve est, en soi, insuffisante pour d\u00e9montrer que, lorsque le Parlement a \u00e9dict\u00e9 la Loi dans sa totalit\u00e9, il avait l\u2019intention d\u2019accorder \u00e0 cette loi la capacit\u00e9 de directement contester d\u2019autres lois. Car, comme je ne crois pas que le plaignant et la Commission soutiennent que cette capacit\u00e9 se limite aux contestations de la Loi sur les Indiens, cette capacit\u00e9 doit donc \u00eatre la m\u00eame pour toutes les autres lois. Pour tirer cette conclusion, nous devons examiner la Loi en entier et, pour les motifs d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s, j\u2019ai conclu que les r\u00e8gles d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois n\u2019appuient pas l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant.\n[104] De plus, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019observation de la Commission, je ne crois pas que cette conclusion retire toute signification \u00e0 l\u2019article 67. M\u00eame si le Parlement avait l\u2019intention de prot\u00e9ger les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens de tout examen au sens de la Loi, l\u2019article 67 pr\u00e9cisait aussi que rien dans la Loi n\u2019affectait \u00ab les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi \u00bb. C\u2019est exactement le sens de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation que la juge Desjardins (alors juge de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale) a effectu\u00e9 dans Desjarlais (Re) (C.A.), [1989] 3 C.F. 605 (Desjarlais), au paragraphe 13 :\nLe mot \u00ab provision \u00bb du membre de phrase \u00ab or any provision made under or pursuant to [the Indian Act] \u00bb (\u00ab et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi \u00bb) ne peut avoir la m\u00eame signification que le premier \u00ab provision \u00bb, et il ne peut renvoyer exclusivement \u00e0 une disposition l\u00e9gislative d\u2019application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ainsi que le pr\u00e9tend l\u2019avocat de la Commission. La version fran\u00e7aise rend une telle interpr\u00e9tation impossible. Le mot \u00ab dispositions \u00bb de cette version pourrait avoir le sens de \u00ab mesures l\u00e9gislatives \u00bb, mais il connote \u00e9galement les notions de \u00ab d\u00e9cisions \u00bb et de \u00ab mesures \u00bb, dont la compr\u00e9hension est tr\u00e8s grande. Ainsi les termes \u00ab or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act \u00bb d\u00e9signent-ils plus que les seules stipulations \u00e0 caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gal. J\u2019interpr\u00e8te ces mots comme s\u2019\u00e9tendant \u00e0 toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[105] Dans Desjarlais, la Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire dont elle \u00e9tait saisie, soit un vote de censure d\u2019un conseil de bande, ou le cong\u00e9diement de l\u2019une des administratrices de la bande au motif qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait trop vieille, ne prenait appui nulle part dans la Loi sur les Indiens et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vis\u00e9e par l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 63(2) (devenu ensuite l\u2019article 67) de la Loi. Malgr\u00e9 cette conclusion, l\u2019affaire a depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e comme jurisprudence en raison de son interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 67. Dans Laslo c. Conseil de la bande indienne de Gordon, [1996] C.H.R.D. No. 12 (Laslo), le Tribunal s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur cette interpr\u00e9tation, concluant que l\u2019article 67 de la Loi s\u2019appliquait aux d\u00e9cisions qui, en vertu de leur sujet, rel\u00e8vent du pouvoir express\u00e9ment accord\u00e9 par une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens : Laslo, aux paragraphes 43 et 44. Le Tribunal a conclu que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 67, le refus du conseil de bande de la r\u00e9serve Gordon de donner un logis \u00e0 Mme Laslo, une Indienne r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment au pouvoir que lui accordait l\u2019article 20 de la Loi sur les Indiens, \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen au titre de la Loi. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette conclusion : Laslo c. Bande de Gordon (Conseil), [2000] A.C.F. no 1175.\n[106] Loin d\u2019\u00eatre insignifiante, l\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 permet maintenant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de plaintes de ce genre \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et au Tribunal. La Loi sur les Indiens pr\u00e9voit la prestation de nombreux services et donne aux bandes le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019appliquer diverses r\u00e8gles et politiques, qui rel\u00e8vent cens\u00e9ment toutes, maintenant, de la Loi. \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9claration de Jim Prentice, alors ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien, lors d\u2019une comparution en 2007 devant le Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du d\u00e9veloppement du Grand Nord, portant sur l\u2019abrogation propos\u00e9e de l\u2019article 67 de la Loi, sur laquelle la Commission se fonde, illustre bien les r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019abrogation :\nL\u2019abrogation de l\u2019article 67 donnera \u00e0 nos citoyens autochtones, et en particulier aux femmes, la possibilit\u00e9 de faire ce qu\u2019elles ne peuvent pas faire aujourd\u2019hui, soit d\u00e9poser un grief relativement \u00e0 une action soit de leur gouvernement autochtone soit, franchement, du gouvernement du Canada, relativement \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions qui les touchent. Cela peut englober l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des programmes, l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des services, la qualit\u00e9 des services offerts, en sus d\u2019autres questions, tel que l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 la bande, je suppose.\n[107] Bien que mon raisonnement interdise la contestation d\u2019une d\u00e9cision ou d\u2019un acte qui d\u00e9coule directement de la Loi sur les Indiens, les d\u00e9cisions ou les actes qui constituent un \u00ab acte discriminatoire \u00bb au sens des articles 5 \u00e0 25 de la Loi et qui aurait auparavant \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00ab dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime \u00bb de la Loi sur les Indiens rel\u00e8vent maintenant de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Le fait que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 instruire des affaires de ce genre est une preuve de plus de ce fait (voir, par exemple, Louie et Beattie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2011 TCDP 2).\n[108] La Commission soutient que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019Allan Tallman, le registraire des Indiens, et la jurisprudence du Tribunal, comme la d\u00e9cision Jacobs c. Mohawk Council of Kahnawake, [1998] D.C.D.P. no 2 (Jacobs), montrent que l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un \u00ab service \u00bb, susceptible d\u2019examen au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. La Commission soutient que, si l\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande, qui est aussi li\u00e9e \u00e0 la relation entre un individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat, est reconnue comme \u00ab service \u00bb, alors l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien devrait l\u2019\u00eatre aussi.\n[109] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi sur les Indiens, les bandes ont la capacit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4ler leur propre effectif en fonction de leurs propres r\u00e8gles d\u2019appartenance. L\u2019appartenance \u00e0 une bande, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les bandes ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ce contr\u00f4le, n\u2019est donc pas r\u00e9gie par la Loi sur les Indiens comme telle, mais par un ensemble de r\u00e8gles permises par la loi. Une contestation au sujet de l\u2019appartenance n\u2019est donc, dans le contexte qui nous int\u00e9resse, pas une contestation de la loi et, par cons\u00e9quent, peut davantage \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme un \u00ab service \u00bb, fourni par la bande, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, on ne peut dire la m\u00eame chose de l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indien, dont les modalit\u00e9s sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9finies dans la Loi sur les Indiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, la port\u00e9e de ce qui constitue ou non un \u00ab service \u00bb n\u2019est pas d\u00e9finie par la relation entre un individu et l\u2019\u00c9tat, comme le soutient la Commission, mais plut\u00f4t par la question de savoir si ce qui est contest\u00e9 constitue une attaque directe \u00e0 l\u2019acte de l\u00e9gislation du Parlement, qui rel\u00e8ve alors de la Charte, ou constitue un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi et au sens des motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent.\nVII. Conclusion [110] Bien que mon raisonnement n\u2019entra\u00eene pas une d\u00e9cision en faveur du plaignant, je ne veux pas diminuer la souffrance que sa famille et lui ont subie en raison des politiques d\u2019\u00e9mancipation du gouvernement. M\u00eame si les plaignants ne peuvent pas contester les articles vis\u00e9s de la Loi sur les Indiens au titre de la Loi, ils peuvent choisir de le faire au titre de la Charte, au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait avec succ\u00e8s dans l\u2019affaire McIvor, par exemple, au sujet des alin\u00e9as 6(1)a) et 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le Tribunal n\u2019est cependant pas l\u2019instance appropri\u00e9e pour instruire la contestation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[111] Je r\u00e9pondrai donc ainsi aux questions A et B :\nA. Les plaintes portent-elles sur la prestation de services destin\u00e9s au public au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, ou sont-elles uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi?\nR\u00e9ponse : Les plaintes sont uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi.\nB. Si les plaintes sont uniquement une contestation d\u2019une loi, la Loi permet-elle l\u2019instruction de telles plaintes?\nR\u00e9ponse : Non.\nCompte tenu de ces r\u00e9ponses, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 trancher les questions C et D :\nC. Le plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination?\nD. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la discrimination prima facie n\u2019a pas eu lieu tel qu\u2019il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l\u2019acte \u00e9tait justifiable au sens de la Loi?\n[112] Pour ces motifs, les plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 30 septembre 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1686\/4111 et T1725\/8011\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Roger William Andrews et Roger William Andrews au nom de Michelle Dominique Andrews c.

Canadian National Railway, 2010 TCDP 23, je tire les conclusions qui suivent.\n[2] Les parties pr\u00e9senteront des observations \u00e9crites sur les questions suivantes :\n1. Quelle m\u00e9thode convient-il d\u2019utiliser pour calculer l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire \u00e0 verser \u00e0 Mme Seeley ?\n2. Mme Seeley a-t-elle le droit de recevoir un paiement en remplacement des avantages sociaux auxquels elle n\u2019a pas eu droit (assurance-maladie compl\u00e9mentaire, assurance des soins dentaires, assurance contre les accidents et assurance vie) et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quel est le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 laquelle elle a droit ?\n[3] Je tiens \u00e0 rappeler aux parties qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019audition de la plainte, elles ont amplement eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de d\u00e9poser des documents au sujet de la perte de salaire. Elles ont choisi de ne pas le faire. Elles estimaient qu\u2019une fois l\u2019affaire tranch\u00e9e sur le fond, elles pourraient s\u2019entendre sur le sujet et elles ont donc demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance exposant en termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre. Cela explique le paragraphe 183 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, qui est libell\u00e9 ainsi :\n[183] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour tout le salaire et les avantages qu\u2019elle a perdus, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de ma conclusion au sujet de la date de r\u00e9tablissement, j\u2019ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour toute perte de salaire et d\u2019avantages \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2007 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour. J\u2019ordonne aux parties de calculer le montant du salaire en fonction de la formule pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. En ce qui a trait aux paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019un chef de train peut recevoir, comme il serait difficile pour le Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9tablir un montant, le Tribunal ordonne aux parties qu\u2019elles \u00e9tablissent ce montant en examinant les montants suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un conducteur travaillant dans le terminal qui aurait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable, en supposant que le chef de train n\u2019avait pas d\u2019absences inhabituelles. Par exemple, les parties pourraient tenir compte des paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[4] Les parties ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 pri\u00e9es de collaborer pour d\u00e9terminer le montant \u00e0 verser \u00e0 la plaignante. La mention, dans le paragraphe ci-dessus, de l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006 constitue un exemple et rien d\u2019autre. Cet employ\u00e9 fait peut-\u00eatre partie du groupe de comparaison appropri\u00e9, si l\u2019on suppose, comme il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait \u00ab pas d\u2019absences inhabituelles \u00bb. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (la Compagnie) est la mieux plac\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant que c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance tenue le 28 ao\u00fbt 2013 qu\u2019elle devrait s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter en premier et expliquer, avec preuve \u00e0 l\u2019appui, comment elle avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 pour calculer le montant \u00e0 verser \u00e0 la plaignante. Il sera ensuite demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de r\u00e9pondre aux arguments de la Compagnie et de pr\u00e9ciser, si elle choisit de le faire, pourquoi elle a l\u2019impression que la proc\u00e9dure utilis\u00e9e par la Compagnie ne convient pas. La Compagnie aura alors la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pliquer. Compte tenu de ces arguments, je rendrai une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si la m\u00e9thode propos\u00e9e par la Compagnie pour calculer la perte de salaire est appropri\u00e9e.\n[5] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019ordonne que les arguments de la Compagnie soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au plus tard le 15 novembre 2013. La plaignante aura jusqu\u2019au 15 janvier 2014 pour d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9ponse. Ensuite, la Compagnie aura jusqu\u2019au 30 janvier pour d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9plique.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 2 octobre 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1355\/8508\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Denise Seeley c.

La plainte et la requ\u00eate en ajournement\n[1] Le plaignant, membre non actif de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la GRC), affirme qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de trouble de stress post-traumatique (TSPT) \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un accident de la route r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions. Le plaignant dit que, suivant son diagnostic de TPST, le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2004, le minist\u00e8re des Anciens Combattants lui a accord\u00e9 une pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 partielle.\n[2] Le plaignant affirme que son employeur, l\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, n\u2019a pas pris de mesures d\u2019adaptation pour tenir compte de son TSPT. Selon le plaignant, cette omission de la part de son employeur a exacerb\u00e9 ses sympt\u00f4mes \u00e0 un point tel qu\u2019il est devenu incapable de travailler.\n[3] Le plaignant soutient donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 [la Loi], fond\u00e9 sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[4] \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, l\u2019affaire doit \u00eatre entendue du 7 au 25 octobre 2013, \u00e0 Vancouver, en Colombie Britannique.

Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une offre de tentative de r\u00e8glement de la plainte par la m\u00e9diation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e, le Tribunal s\u2019est employ\u00e9 \u00e0 g\u00e9rer activement le dossier en vue de l\u2019audience.\n[6] Une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2013. Au cours de celle-ci, toutes les parties ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elles avaient divulgu\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 de leur dossier. Mis \u00e0 part quelques \u00e9changes au sujet du lieu de l\u2019audience, aucune autre question n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par les parties, et les dates d\u2019audience ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es.\n[7] Le 19 avril 2013, une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance a lieu. Aucune question de divulgation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par les parties. Celles-ci n\u2019ont pas non plus soulev\u00e9 de questions concernant la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du plaignant.\n[8] Le Tribunal a tenu une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance le 10 juillet 2013. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 quatre points : l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits; la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour traiter de pertes ult\u00e9rieures; l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 du dossier de pension des Anciens Combattants du plaignant; et l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la liste de t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s du plaignant.\n[9] En ce qui concerne la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour traiter des pertes ult\u00e9rieures, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites sur le sujet et a \u00e9tabli un calendrier pour la pr\u00e9sentation de celles-ci, puis a fix\u00e9 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance au 30 septembre 2013.\n[10] Quant au dossier de pension des Anciens Combattants, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande au titre de la Loi sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information afin d\u2019obtenir le dossier et qu\u2019il discuterait de la question avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la production tardive de ces documents pourrait lui causer pr\u00e9judice. Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 que les parties l\u2019avisent s\u2019il y avait du nouveau sur la question avant la tenue de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9vue pour le 30 septembre 2013.\n[11] En ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la liste de t\u00e9moins propos\u00e9s par le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il se pouvait qu\u2019elle demande que certaines des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner soient annul\u00e9es. Les parties ont convenu de discuter de la question entre elles et que, si elles ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9poserait une requ\u00eate en annulation des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le Tribunal a rappel\u00e9 aux parties qu\u2019une requ\u00eate peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en tout temps. Cependant, pour pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, les questions en suspens doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es rapidement, dans la mesure du possible. Le Tribunal a fait savoir que, plus le nombre de questions soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape ci de la proc\u00e9dure est grand, plus ces questions peuvent avoir des r\u00e9percussions importantes sur l\u2019audience et occasionner des retards.\n[12] Le 12 ao\u00fbt 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9senterait plus de requ\u00eate concernant la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour accorder une indemnit\u00e9 concernant les pertes ult\u00e9rieures et qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e0 ce sujet dans ses observations finales \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, un peu avant l\u2019autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit ce qui suit aux parties le 19 septembre 2013 :\n[traduction]\nL\u2019ordre du jour de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance qui aura lieu le 30 septembre 2013, \u00e0 10 h 30 (heure normale du Pacifique), 13 h 30 (heure normale de l\u2019Est), est le suivant :\n1. L\u2019annulation de l\u2019assignation \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner pour deux t\u00e9moins\nLe Tribunal demande aux parties d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00eates \u00e0 faire le point sur la situation. Si la question n\u2019est toujours pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, le Tribunal demande aux parties d\u2019\u00eatre enti\u00e8rement pr\u00eates \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations de vive voix sur cette question particuli\u00e8re pour permettre \u00e0 la membre du Tribunal, dans la mesure du possible, de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de vive voix lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les choses.\n2. L\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et\/ou le recueil conjoint de documents\n3. Autres questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es\nLe Tribunal demande aux parties d\u2019\u00eatre enti\u00e8rement pr\u00eates \u00e0 faire le point sur l\u2019ensemble de la situation concernant les questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et d\u2019\u00eatre enti\u00e8rement pr\u00eates \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations de vive voix sur les questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, si les deux parties sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 au courant de ces questions, pour permettre \u00e0 la membre du Tribunal, dans la mesure du possible, de rendre une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate de vive voix lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les choses.\n4. L\u2019annulation de l\u2019audience du 25 octobre\n[13] Avant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la question de l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la liste de t\u00e9moins du plaignant et celle de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle requ\u00eate en annulation des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es. Cependant, le 25 septembre 2013, le plaignant a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour l\u2019aviser de ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLes avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont fait savoir qu\u2019ils avaient l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter une demande de suspension de l\u2019audience au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions \u2013 compte tenu du fait que l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre suspendue jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le gendarme Fraser pr\u00e9sente une nouvelle demande de pension des Anciens Combattants (AC) (la pension des AC) relativement aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui constituent l\u2019objet de la plainte devant le Tribunal et de la proc\u00e9dure judiciaire.\nLe gendarme Fraser s\u2019opposera \u00e0 la demande.\nToute demande au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions doit \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par \u00e9crit au Tribunal et aux avocats du gendarme Fraser et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne imm\u00e9diatement et au moins deux jours ouvrables complets avant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance du 30 septembre.\n[14] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la correspondance du plaignant le 26 septembre 2013 :\n[traduction]\nCher ma\u00eetre,\nLa membre du Tribunal Sophie Marchildon a examin\u00e9 la correspondance ci-dessous de M. Beasley.\nVu l\u2019audience \u00e0 venir, et pour veiller au d\u00e9roulement efficace de la conf\u00e9rence, Mme Marchildon demande \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019informer par \u00e9crit le Tribunal de la fa\u00e7on dont elle a l\u2019intention de proc\u00e9der concernant la question et de fournir d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions au plus tard en fin de journ\u00e9e demain (27 septembre 2013) pour lui donner suffisamment de temps pour examiner les renseignements fournis avant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit le 26 septembre 2013 :\n[traduction]\nVeuillez prendre note qu\u2019hier l\u2019intim\u00e9e a re\u00e7u de l\u2019avocat du plaignant une lettre dat\u00e9e du 24 septembre 2013 \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait joint un CD comportant 734 pages de documents d\u00e9tenus par le minist\u00e8re des Anciens Combattants. Plus t\u00f4t, nous avons re\u00e7u, le 17 septembre 2013, un CD comprenant des copies de documents d\u00e9tenus par le Tribunal des anciens combattants (r\u00e9vision et appel). Cela fait tr\u00e8s longtemps que l\u2019intim\u00e9e attend que ces documents lui soient communiqu\u00e9s et elle aura besoin de les examiner en profondeur avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions s\u2019applique. Nous nous efforcerons de nous acquitter de cette t\u00e2che d\u00e8s que nous le pourrons, mais l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier propos\u00e9 par le plaignant pour la pr\u00e9sentation des documents relatifs \u00e0 la demande n\u2019est pas raisonnable.\n[16] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance du 30 septembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire, devant avoir lieu du 7 au 25 octobre 2013, soit ajourn\u00e9e. Les parties ont fourni des observations de vive voix au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance et ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elles estimaient qu\u2019elles avaient eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet de la demande d\u2019ajournement.\n[17] Suivant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance du 30 septembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a envoy\u00e9 la lettre suivante au Tribunal :\n[traduction]\nNous savons que la membre instructrice rendra une d\u00e9cision au sujet de la demande d\u2019ajournement d\u2019ici demain. Suivant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, et, si le Tribunal rejette la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et d\u00e9cide de disjoindre l\u2019audience devant commencer le 7 octobre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e propose ce qui suit concernant les dates de la tenue de l\u2019audience et de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate.\n\u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, l\u2019audience devrait durer presque trois semaines compl\u00e8tes. Si la question du pr\u00e9judice fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une disjonction, il ne sera alors pas n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9voir trois semaines pour la tenue de l\u2019audience. Comme les documents relatifs \u00e0 la pension des AC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits tardivement, il sera difficile pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter sa requ\u00eate le 7 octobre 2013 pour toutes les raisons expos\u00e9es lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique ce matin. Par cons\u00e9quent, nous proposons que, si le Tribunal d\u00e9cide de ne pas accueillir la demande d\u2019ajournement et d\u00e9cide de disjoindre l\u2019audience, cette derni\u00e8re ne devrait pas commencer avant le 15 octobre 2013 au plus t\u00f4t, ce qui permettrait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019avoir le temps d\u2019examiner les documents d\u2019AC, d\u2019\u00e9tablir si l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions s\u2019applique et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de pr\u00e9senter la demande. Si les documents appuient une telle demande, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019attend \u00e0 la pr\u00e9senter le 14 octobre 2013.\n[18] La lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9e refl\u00e8te les observations qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance qui a eu lieu plus t\u00f4t le m\u00eame jour.\n[19] Le plaignant a r\u00e9pondu ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLe plaignant, Stuart Fraser, s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019envoi de cette lettre, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la demande qu\u2019elle renferme. Mme Marchildon a mis fin aux observations sur la demande d\u2019ajournement. Avant d\u2019y mettre fin, elle a demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles avaient d\u2019autres observations. Le minist\u00e8re de la Justice n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019autres observations.\nLe plaignant a assign\u00e9 des personnes \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner pour l\u2019audience devant commencer le 7 octobre. Certains de ces t\u00e9moins ne sont pas disponibles au cours de la semaine du 15 ou du 21 octobre.\nIII. La position des parties\n[20] La demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est fond\u00e9e sur le fait que le plaignant lui a divulgu\u00e9 des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires les 17 et 25 septembre 2013. Le 25 septembre, le plaignant lui a fourni approximativement 734 pages de documents, et ce, moins de deux semaines avant la date pr\u00e9vue pour l\u2019audience. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019elle a besoin de temps pour examiner ces documents en d\u00e9tail afin de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense pleine et enti\u00e8re au sujet des all\u00e9gations du plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aimerait \u00e9galement avoir la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les documents afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir si elle pr\u00e9sentera une demande de suspension de la proc\u00e9dure au titre de la l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions, L.R.C., 1985, ch. P-6. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019en raison de la divulgation tardive des documents et du court laps de temps accord\u00e9 pour les examiner, elle n\u2019a pas eu suffisamment de temps pour examiner les documents de mani\u00e8re approfondie et pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y avait lieu de pr\u00e9senter une demande de suspension au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le d\u00e9faut du plaignant du divulguer et de produire les documents n\u00e9cessaires de fa\u00e7on continue explique la divulgation tardive et la demande d\u2019ajournement en d\u00e9coulant.\n[21] Le plaignant dit que la demande d\u2019ajournement de derni\u00e8re minute de l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui cause pr\u00e9judice. Il est pr\u00eat \u00e0 aller de l\u2019avant et veut que l\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. Le plaignant affirme avoir effectu\u00e9 la divulgation initiale de ses documents \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e il y a plus d\u2019un an. Bien que des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires aient \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s en juillet 2013, ces documents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en la possession du plaignant et, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne consid\u00e8re pas qu\u2019ils sont vis\u00e9s par son l\u2019obligation de divulgation continue. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il a fait ce qu\u2019il a pu pour faire parvenir ces documents \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais en septembre 2013. Le plaignant estime donc que la demande d\u2019ajournement aurait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e bien plus t\u00f4t et que le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tard\u00e9 avant de pr\u00e9senter sa demande ne devrait pas causer pr\u00e9judice au plaignant en ce qui concerne l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire.\n[22] La Commission s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement. En ce qui concerne plus particuli\u00e8rement la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une demande de suspension au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions, la Commission soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu soulever cette question devant la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)b) de la Loi. Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu d\u00e9battre de la question devant le Tribunal dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et donner au plaignant l\u2019occasion d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. La Commission dit qu\u2019une semaine avant l\u2019audience, il est maintenant trop tard pour soulever ces questions.\nIV. Analyse\n[23] Comme le refl\u00e8tent la correspondance des parties avant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance du 30 septembre 2013, la position des parties quant \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de vive voix au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, ainsi que les lettres que celles-ci ont envoy\u00e9es suivant l\u2019appel, il semblait y avoir eu de la confusion quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9e demandait un ajournement en raison de la divulgation tardive ou si elle en demandait une au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions. Il ressort clairement des observations des parties que l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande un ajournement en raison de la divulgation tardive.\n[24] Cela \u00e9tant dit, il se peut que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente une demande de suspension de la proc\u00e9dure au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions en raison de la divulgation tardive. Cependant, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question \u00e9ventuelle qu\u2019il vaut mieux remettre \u00e0 plus tard, lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9cidera si l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions s\u2019applique et pr\u00e9sentera une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ne portera pas sur les questions se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions.\n[25] En ce qui concerne la demande d\u2019ajournement, il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et que l\u2019ajournement d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure rel\u00e8ve de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire. Le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en tenant compte du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi et de l\u2019exigence selon laquelle l\u2019instruction des plaintes doit se faire sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle (voir Baltruweit c. Canada (Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 14 \u00e0 17; Zhou v. National Research Council, 2009 CHRT 11, au paragraphe 4 [Zhou]; L\u00e9ger c.

Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2013 TCDP 16, au paragraphe 50).\n[26] Pour que le Tribunal puisse s\u2019acquitter de son mandat de r\u00e9gler les plaintes de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, je consid\u00e8re \u00e9galement que les commentaires que le Tribunal a formul\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Zhou, au paragraphe 8, sont pertinents par rapport aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[traduction]\nLe Tribunal doit faire preuve d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 quand il instruit les causes afin de s\u2019acquitter du mandat que le l\u00e9gislateur lui a confi\u00e9 d\u2019entendre et de r\u00e9gler les plaintes de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive (paragr. 48.9(1) de la LCDP; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. AFPC et CCDP, 2008 CF 223, au paragr. 274; Nova Scotia Construction Safety Association, Collins and Kelly c. Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission and Davison 2006 NSCA 63, au paragr. 76). La tenue d\u2019une audience exige des ressources financi\u00e8res et humaines consid\u00e9rables. Ces ressources ne peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9affect\u00e9es sans que cela ne s\u00e8me la perturbation dans l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019organisation, particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente \u00e9tape du processus. De telles perturbations affectent non seulement l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ancier de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, mais \u00e9galement celui de tous les autres litiges en instance. C\u2019est pourquoi un ajournement n\u2019est accord\u00e9 que dans les cas o\u00f9 aller de l\u2019avant entraverait manifestement la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable.\n[27] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 mon avis, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le Tribunal doit prendre en consid\u00e9ration pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder un ajournement en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont les suivants :\n(a) le pr\u00e9judice que subira le plaignant si la pr\u00e9sente affaire est retard\u00e9e;\n(b) le pr\u00e9judice que subira l\u2019intim\u00e9e si l\u2019affaire est entendue sans tarder, et ce, sans qu\u2019elle ait pu examiner pleinement les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires divulgu\u00e9s, et alors qu\u2019elle n\u2019a dispos\u00e9 que d\u2019un court laps de temps pour pr\u00e9parer sa preuve;\n(c) l\u2019incidence qu\u2019il y aura sur l\u2019organisation du Tribunal si la proc\u00e9dure est retard\u00e9e et\/ou s\u2019il faut trouver d\u2019autres dates d\u2019audience convenant au Tribunal, aux parties et aux t\u00e9moins.\n[28] Comme ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments le montrent, il n\u2019existe pas de solution id\u00e9ale \u00e0 la question qui se pose. Au moins une des parties, voire la totalit\u00e9 des parties, subira un pr\u00e9judice quelle que soit la d\u00e9cision que je prendrai.\n[29] Si je mets en balance les int\u00e9r\u00eats des deux parties, je conclus que c\u2019est le plaignant qui subirait le plus grand pr\u00e9judice si l\u2019audience ne se d\u00e9roule pas comme pr\u00e9vu. Le plaignant est pr\u00eat \u00e0 aller de l\u2019avant; tous les t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9s et sont pr\u00eats pour l\u2019audience. Si l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue est report\u00e9e \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celles fix\u00e9es pour l\u2019audition, selon son calendrier, le Tribunal ne pourra pas instruire la plainte du plaignant avant le mois de mars 2014. Ce n\u2019est pas la meilleure fa\u00e7on de tenir compte du droit du plaignant d\u2019\u00eatre entendu en temps opportun et du mandat du Tribunal d\u2019instruire les plaintes de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive suivant le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi. De plus, cela aurait aussi une incidence sur les ressources du Tribunal pour la pr\u00e9sente affaire ainsi que pour les autres affaires, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans la d\u00e9cision Zhou susmentionn\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que trois semaines d\u2019audience cons\u00e9cutives avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues pour octobre 2013 depuis le d\u00e9but f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[30] Cela \u00e9tant dit, je comprends \u00e9galement le pr\u00e9judice dont m\u2019a fait part l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Il n\u2019existe pas de solution id\u00e9ale. Bien que certains des documents divulgu\u00e9s tardivement puissent concerner le fonds de la plainte et\/ou les redressements demand\u00e9s par le plaignant, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019il se pouvait qu\u2019il y ait lieu de pr\u00e9senter une demande de suspension au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions, il semble qu\u2019il y ait un souci g\u00e9n\u00e9ral concernant la pension d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du plaignant et la possibilit\u00e9 de double indemnisation. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 saisie des documents et je ne peux pas me prononcer sur leur pertinence par rapport aux questions qui se posent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle. Cependant, en ce qui concerne la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une demande de suspension soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions, il serait sans doute utile de s\u00e9parer la preuve relative au fond de la plainte de celle relative aux redressements. Cela \u00e9tant dit, la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019une requ\u00eate soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 111 de la Loi sur les pensions n\u2019est pas un motif suffisant pour ajourner la totalit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience.\n[31] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roulera comme pr\u00e9vu. Toutefois, il se peut que la partie de l\u2019audience portant sur les redressements qui peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9s soit disjointe du reste de l\u2019audience une fois que j\u2019aurai entendu des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires sur la question au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. Il sera demand\u00e9 aux parties d\u2019avoir des directives concernant la proposition de dates pour la tenue de l\u2019audience sur les redressements au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e prochaine.\n[32] En ce qui concerne la question de la divulgation tardive, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aura la possibilit\u00e9 de rappeler des t\u00e9moins, sous r\u00e9serve de la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations par les parties et d\u2019une d\u00e9cision de ma part \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut soulever des questions au sujet du pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle a subi au cours de l\u2019audience, et, suivant la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations par les parties, je trancherai la question. Cela donnera peut-\u00eatre lieu \u00e0 un bref ajournement d\u2019une demi journ\u00e9e, ou bien d\u2019une journ\u00e9e ou deux, en fonction de la nature de l\u2019objection soulev\u00e9e.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019il commencera \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le plaignant doit se rappeler que, si la divulgation tardive qu\u2019il a faite a une incidence sur la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cela pourrait retarder l\u2019audience, et ce, m\u00eame si la pr\u00e9sente demande d\u2019ajournement a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nV. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[34] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je rejette la demande d\u2019ajournement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n2 octobre 2013",

Brian Blodgett (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la plainte initiale) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) contre son employeur, GE \u2013 Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e). La plainte initiale est une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, en contravention avec l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6, version modifi\u00e9e (la Loi).\n[2] Le 28 juin 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission (la deuxi\u00e8me plainte), dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue subir des actes persistants de discrimination, de harc\u00e8lement et de repr\u00e9sailles du fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re plainte, ce qui est contraire au paragraphe 14(1) et \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[3] Le 24 septembre 2012, dans une lettre (la lettre de renvoi), conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre instructeur pour instruire la plainte initiale, dont une copie \u00e9tait jointe \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi.\n[4] Le plaignant est membre d\u2019un syndicat (le syndicat). Son emploi est r\u00e9gi par une convention collective entre le syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e (la convention collective).\n[5] Le 14 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions (EDP), en plus d\u2019une requ\u00eate en modification (la requ\u00eate ou la requ\u00eate en modification). La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate porte sur la requ\u00eate en modification.\n[6] Le 11 janvier 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son EDP. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate en modification du plaignant n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et que la requ\u00eate n\u2019avait donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e, l\u2019EDF de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne traite pas des modifications contest\u00e9es (voir ci-dessous) ni de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte.\nII. La plainte initiale\n[7] Dans sa plainte initiale, le plaignant all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il y avait une [traduction] \u00ab [...] tendance \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge [de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e] envers [le plaignant] qui a commenc\u00e9 en 2008 \u00bb. Le plaignant estime avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9 de possibilit\u00e9s et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de son \u00e2ge.\n[8] Dans sa plainte initiale, le plaignant expose les all\u00e9gations suivantes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge :\nrefus d\u2019une affectation au projet West Shift, octobre 2009;\nrefus d\u2019une formation sur la gravure au laser, le 14 mai 2010;\nrefus d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi dans le cadre du projet West Shift, octobre 2008.\nIII. La deuxi\u00e8me plainte\n[9] Dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 28 juin 2012, le plaignant all\u00e8gue les incidents suivants :\nrefus d\u2019une affectation au projet West Shift en juillet 2011 ou vers cette date, et comportement mena\u00e7ant et intimidant de la part du superviseur de la fabrication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui constituait aussi des repr\u00e9sailles, ce qui est contraire aux articles 7 et 14.1 de la Loi;\ndes actes de harc\u00e8lement et d\u2019intimidation de la part de la direction de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en janvier 2012;\nrefus d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 de formation Orange Badge en juin 2012, qui, selon le plaignant, est un autre exemple d\u2019acte [traduction] \u00ab persistant \u00bb de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, en contravention avec l\u2019article 7 de la Loi.\nIV. La requ\u00eate en modification du plaignant\n[10] La requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte initiale vise \u00e0 ajouter deux (2) groupes de plaintes \u00e0 la plainte initiale :\ncelles faisant partie de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte;\ndeux all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, qui constitueraient des repr\u00e9sailles du fait qu\u2019une premi\u00e8re plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, en particulier :\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du plaignant comme chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe de son groupe (fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe) en ao\u00fbt 2010 (le mois pr\u00e9cis est contest\u00e9);\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 d\u2019attribuer au plaignant un poste temporaire d\u2019aide\u2011ing\u00e9nieur d\u2019assurance de la qualit\u00e9 et d\u2019assurer une formation polyvalente (poste d\u2019AIAQ) en janvier 2011.\n[11] Les modifications demand\u00e9es figurent aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 32 de la requ\u00eate, ainsi qu\u2019il est d\u00e9taill\u00e9 aux paragraphes 33 \u00e0 61 de l\u2019EDP du plaignant.\n[12] Je d\u00e9signerai collectivement le deuxi\u00e8me groupe de modifications sous l\u2019appellation \u00ab modifications contest\u00e9es \u00bb et, s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, sous les appellations \u00ab destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00bb et \u00ab poste d\u2019AIAQ \u00bb, respectivement.\nV. Les observations \u00e9crites apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate\n[13] Le 1er mai 2013, j\u2019ai entendu la partie orale de la requ\u00eate en modification. Apr\u00e8s la fin des plaidoiries des parties, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites sur les affaires suivantes : Kanagasabapathy c. Air Canada, 2013 TCDP 7 (Air Canada); Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada c. Alain Parent et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, 2006 CF 1313 (Parent) et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Assoc. canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776 (ACET). La position du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces affaires ainsi que mon analyse et ma conclusion \u00e0 leur sujet sont formul\u00e9es plus bas dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nVI. La position de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne au moment de la requ\u00eate\n[14] L\u2019avocat de la Commission \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent au moment de la pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate. La Commission n\u2019a pas pris position relativement aux modifications contest\u00e9es. L\u2019avocat de la Commission a cependant fourni de l\u2019information en ce qui a trait au droit et au processus, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s utile \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nVII. Le droit relatif \u00e0 la modification des plaintes\n[15] Le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi accorde au Tribunal une \u00ab discr\u00e9tion consid\u00e9rable \u00bb relativement \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019instruction des plaintes \u00bb (Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), notamment ce qui concerne le fait de faire droit \u00e0 des requ\u00eates en modification d\u2019une plainte ou de rejeter celles-ci.\n[16] Le Tribunal dispose d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire consid\u00e9rable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019autorisation des modifications pour d\u00e9terminer les \u00ab [...] v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb, si l\u2019autorisation des modifications sert les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice (Parent, au paragraphe 30). Toutefois, une modification ne doit pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e si elle cause un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 d\u2019autres parties (Parent, au paragraphe 40).\n[17] Une modification ne peut aboutir \u00e0 une nouvelle plainte et doit \u00eatre li\u00e9e, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale (Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran c. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 (Tran), aux paragraphes 17 et 18. Il doit y avoir un lien, en fait et en droit, entre la plainte et la modification demand\u00e9e.\n[18] Le fait de donner droit \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en modification d\u2019une plainte repose non seulement sur \u00ab [\u2026] la Loi mais aussi sur l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019une question mixte de fait et de droit \u00bb. (Parent, au paragraphe 19)\nVIII. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte \u2013 Faits post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\n[19] Au paragraphe 2 de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019inclusion de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte dans la plainte initiale.\n[20] Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, malgr\u00e9 le consentement du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ajout de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte \u00e0 la plainte initiale, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour rendre une telle ordonnance parce que la Commission n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte au Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi.\n[21] \u00c0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, le 1er mai 2013, les parties ont avis\u00e9 qu\u2019elles avaient toutes deux d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des consentements \u00e9crits aupr\u00e8s de la Commission afin que cette derni\u00e8re renvoie la deuxi\u00e8me plainte au Tribunal, sans qu\u2019il y ait enqu\u00eate de la part de la Commission.\n[22] Le 13 ao\u00fbt 2013, le bureau du Greffe du Tribunal m\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u la lettre de la Commission qui renvoyait la deuxi\u00e8me plainte au Tribunal pour instruction, et cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tait jointe \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi.\n[23] Il n\u2019est donc pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner la question de la comp\u00e9tence soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de se prononcer sur cette question. La pr\u00e9sente ordonnance accordera cette partie de la requ\u00eate en modification du plaignant, qui demande d\u2019inclure la deuxi\u00e8me plainte dans la plainte initiale.\nIX. Le plaignant se repr\u00e9sente lui-m\u00eame\n[24] Lorsque le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte initiale et la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, il n\u2019a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 personne comme repr\u00e9sentant ou comme avocat. Dans la r\u00e9plique du plaignant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, il est indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 14 que [traduction] \u00ab M. Blodgett se repr\u00e9sentait lui-m\u00eame \u00bb. Au paragraphe 43, il est affirm\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nEn tant que non-sp\u00e9cialiste se retrouvant dans les d\u00e9dales du processus, M. Blodgett, \u00e0 certains moments, ne comprenait pas quelle \u00e9tait la mani\u00e8re id\u00e9ale d\u2019int\u00e9grer l\u2019ensemble de ses all\u00e9gations \u00bb [...] et \u00ab a pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que, parce qu\u2019il avait officiellement port\u00e9 plainte aupr\u00e8s de Mme Falconi [de la Commission] au sujet du refus de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019occuper un emploi d\u2019AIAQ, cette all\u00e9gation faisait partie du fond de sa plainte initiale.\n[25] Il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 si le plaignant a consult\u00e9 ou non un avocat ou a autrement demand\u00e9 un avis juridique avant novembre 2012, mais aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, j\u2019accepte le fait qu\u2019il s\u2019est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 lui-m\u00eame jusqu\u2019en novembre 2012, date \u00e0 laquelle son avocat a pris la rel\u00e8ve dans le dossier.\n[26] Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, dans ce cas particulier, ce fait en soi ne l\u2019aide pas. Le plaignant a choisi la langue anglaise pour formuler ses plaintes et r\u00e9diger les lettres. Il semble bien ma\u00eetriser cette langue, et il n\u2019existe aucune observation selon laquelle il ne peut comprendre les mots \u00e9crits ou prononc\u00e9s. Il r\u00e9pond aux questions \u00e9crites de la Commission et ses lettres \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re ne sont pas confuses. Ces faits vont \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du fait que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 au stade de la Commission simplement parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas d\u2019avocat et que cela seul permettrait d\u2019autoriser les modifications qu\u2019il demande.\n[27] Je tiendrai compte, toutefois, du fait que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas d\u2019avocat au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des deux plaintes et que c\u2019est l\u2019un des facteurs \u00e0 pond\u00e9rer pour d\u00e9terminer si la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en ce qui concerne les modifications contest\u00e9es, bien que je n\u2019y accorde pas beaucoup d\u2019importance.\nX. Point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des modifications contest\u00e9es\n[28] L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 accorder la partie de la requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 inclure les modifications contest\u00e9es pour les motifs suivants:\nles plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi. Cette derni\u00e8re pr\u00e9voit en effet une limite d\u2019un an entre le moment de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e infraction \u00e0 la Loi et celui du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard; les modifications contest\u00e9es ne respectent donc pas le d\u00e9lai en question;\nl\u2019autorisation de la modification relative \u00e0 la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure, parce que le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e avaient r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le grief du plaignant de janvier 2010 portant sur la destitution des fonctions en question;\nla destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe est survenue avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t proprement dit de la plainte initiale et ne peut donc constituer des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi;\nla modification recherch\u00e9e doit faire partie de la [traduction] \u00ab situation essentielle \u00bb de la plainte initiale et les modifications contest\u00e9es ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re;\nl\u2019inclusion des modifications contest\u00e9es causerait un pr\u00e9judice fondamental et irr\u00e9parable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nXI. Le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi\n[29] Le paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi \u00e9nonce que la Commission est tenue de statuer sur toute plainte dont elle est saisie, sous r\u00e9serve des exclusions pr\u00e9vues aux alin\u00e9as 41(1)a) \u00e0 e). L\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) fixe un d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an entre une pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e infraction \u00e0 la Loi et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\nA. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[30] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que les modifications contest\u00e9es soient incluses dans la plainte initiale, parce qu\u2019elles ne respectent pas le d\u00e9lai.\nB. Analyse\n[31] Je signale que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) pr\u00e9cise en outre que la Commission a le pouvoir de prolonger le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an \u00e0 \u00ab [\u2026] tout d\u00e9lai sup\u00e9rieur que la Commission estime indiqu\u00e9 dans les circonstances [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[32] Je conclus donc que le d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an n\u2019est pas une contrainte stricte et automatique. Le libell\u00e9 permet plut\u00f4t \u00e0 la Commission, et par cons\u00e9quent au Tribunal, d\u2019examiner les situations pour d\u00e9terminer si elle doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et prolonger le d\u00e9lai \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle estime indiqu\u00e9.\n[33] J\u2019ai pris en compte les situations suivantes :\nle d\u00e9lai de deux ans concernant le poste d\u2019AIAQ et celui de deux ans et demi concernant la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe avant que le plaignant pr\u00e9cise que les modifications contest\u00e9es \u00e9taient en cause, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de la Commission et du Tribunal;\nlorsque le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte initiale, le 16 ao\u00fbt 2010, son grief relatifau salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00e9tait toujours en instance;\nle plaignant all\u00e8gue que le responsable des Ressources humaines de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (les RH) lui a dit qu\u2019il devait d\u2019abord avoir recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs avant de s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la Commission;\nje constate \u00e9galement que, dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, au num\u00e9ro 2, le plaignant mentionnait que la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe constituait des repr\u00e9sailles, bien qu\u2019il ne l\u2019ait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans un paragraphe num\u00e9rot\u00e9 et plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9. Il d\u00e9passait toujours la p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi, mais cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9;\nle fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 a eu pour cons\u00e9quence qu\u2019il ne pouvait r\u00e9diger ses plaintes avec la m\u00eame finesse que celle d\u2019un avocat;\nm\u00eame si les lettres du plaignant r\u00e9dig\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intention de la Commission en 2011, qui faisaient \u00e9tat de la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et du refus de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un poste d\u2019AIAQ, n\u2019ont pas inform\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ces questions, il a qualifi\u00e9 n\u00e9anmoins la destitution de repr\u00e9sailles et aurait peut-\u00eatre cru que les faits faisaient partie de l\u2019ensemble des modalit\u00e9s de r\u00e8glement des plaintes;\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e emploie toujours le m\u00eame personnel de gestion qui \u00e9tait responsable des pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s actes discriminatoires et de repr\u00e9sailles dans les modifications contest\u00e9es; celui-ci est disponible pour t\u00e9moigner;\nla convention collective, bien qu\u2019elle soit importante pour le grief du plaignant, n\u2019est pas utile en ce qui a trait au d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi.\n[34] Pour les motifs ci-dessus, je conclus qu\u2019il est raisonnable dans les circonstances de prolonger le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) \u00e0 la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate en modification du plaignant. L\u2019alin\u00e9a en question n\u2019interdit pas au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la requ\u00eate.\nXII. La question de savoir si la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe constitue des repr\u00e9sailles\n[35] Selon l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\nA. La position du plaignant\n[36] Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a avis\u00e9 les RH de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le 18 mai 2010, qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une plainte relative aux droits de la personne \u00e0 la Commission, la destitution par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe constituait des repr\u00e9sailles au sens de la Loi.\n[37] Le plaignant affirme que la Commission l\u2019avait inform\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inexacte du fait que la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe ne pouvait constituer des repr\u00e9sailles, parce que [traduction] \u00ab celle-ci \u00e9tait survenue avant que GE ait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de sa plainte par la Commission \u00bb. Il fait valoir, en substance, que la Commission aurait d\u00fb consid\u00e9rer que la lettre de mai 2010 du plaignant envoy\u00e9e au service des RH de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui avisait celui-ci de son intention de d\u00e9poser une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission repr\u00e9sentait l\u2019avis proprement dit de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Par cons\u00e9quent, la destitution par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe constituait des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\nB. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[38] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 14.1, la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe ne peut constituer des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de cet article, parce qu\u2019elle est survenue avant que le plaignant ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte initiale, le 16 ao\u00fbt 2010.\nC. Analyse\n[39] Le fait est que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mis de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe. Les documents renferment des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve contradictoires qui soul\u00e8vent des questions sans r\u00e9ponse au sujet des circonstances de cet incident et du moment o\u00f9 il s\u2019est produit. Par exemple, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soul\u00e8vent des questions telles que : qui a dit quoi et quand; de quoi a-t-on discut\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9union du 29 octobre 2010 portant sur le grief; qu\u2019est-ce qui constitue un avis de plainte relative aux droits de la personne.\n[40] Ainsi, que la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe ait constitu\u00e9 ou non des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de la Loi n\u2019est pas une question qui, je crois, peut ou devrait \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e \u00e0 ce stade-ci de l\u2019instance, mais plut\u00f4t apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une explication plus en d\u00e9tail des circonstances a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nXIII. Abus de proc\u00e9dure\nA. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la modification permettant \u00e0 la plainte initiale d\u2019inclure la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe constituerait un recours abusif \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal, parce qu\u2019un r\u00e8glement obligatoire du grief du plaignant interdit de le faire. En janvier 2011, l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le grief de ce dernier au sujet de la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe par une entente selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e devait verser au plaignant le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 27 octobre 2007 au 1er juillet 2010. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pay\u00e9 le plaignant en cons\u00e9quence. Si le Tribunal fait droit \u00e0 cette modification et que le plaignant d\u00e9montre le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations, il faudra donc d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau une question qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e, ce qui entra\u00eenera une double attribution de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Au cours de l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a postul\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait compris, que le plaignant aurait d\u00fb comprendre et que le r\u00e8glement lui avait fait comprendre, que l\u2019[traduction] \u00ab envers de la m\u00e9daille \u00bb de ce r\u00e8glement \u00e9tait que le plaignant avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019exercer les fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe le 1er juillet 2010 et que l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait class\u00e9e.\n[42] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme aussi qu\u2019elle avait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la plainte initiale au niveau de la Commission, qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 des ressources et qu\u2019elle avait pris des d\u00e9cisions en fonction des trois incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte initiale, pour se rendre compte par la suite que la plainte initiale avait chang\u00e9 et que le plaignant avait essay\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter deux incidents qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits il y a longtemps. Si le Tribunal fait droit aux modifications contest\u00e9es, il est donc possible que la plainte devienne, en effet, une [traduction] \u00ab cible mobile \u00bb, avec une liste potentiellement sans fin d\u2019incidents signal\u00e9s de la part du plaignant. Cela constituerait un d\u00e9ni du droit fondamental de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9gler compl\u00e8tement la plainte initiale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la Commission et constitue un recours abusif \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal.\nB. La position du plaignant\n[43] Le plaignant fait valoir que l\u2019ajout \u00e0 la plainte de la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe ne constitue pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure, parce que son grief ne portait que sur le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et non sur une question des droits de la personne d\u00e9coulant de la destitution en question et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il ne s\u2019agit pas de d\u00e9battre \u00e0 nouveau une question qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. L\u2019inclusion de l\u2019incident relatif au refus du poste d\u2019AIAQ ne constitue pas non plus un abus de proc\u00e9dure ni ne transforme la plainte en une [traduction] \u00ab cible mobile \u00bb, parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e dans la lettre d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2011 que la plaignante avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission et qu\u2019elle fait partie de [traduction] \u00ab toutes les circonstances \u00bb relatives \u00e0 la plainte.\nC. Analyse\n[44] J\u2019ai pris en compte les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants, qui font partie des documents li\u00e9s \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le grief (voir ci-dessous) est joint, en annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, \u00e0 la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, tout comme les courriels et les lettres.\nle 12 janvier 2010, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le grief 2010-3 (le grief) \u00e9non\u00e7ant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas voulu lui verser la prime de cinq p. 100 (5 % ) relative \u00e0 son travail \u00e0 titre de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe (salaire du chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe), ce qui contrevenait aux dispositions de la convention collective; il demandait une [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9paration compl\u00e8te \u00bb;\nen mai 2010, il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au service des RH pour lui faire part de son intention de d\u00e9poser une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne;\nle plaignant affirme que le service des HR lui aurait dit qu\u2019il devait d\u2019abord \u00e9puiser la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs;\nen juin 2010, le service des RH a rejet\u00e9 le grief relatif au salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe;\nle plaignant a interjet\u00e9 appel de la d\u00e9cision du service des RH et a demand\u00e9 de passer au [traduction] \u00ab palier suivant \u00bb de la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs;\nle 16 ao\u00fbt 2010, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte initiale \u00e0 la Commission et n\u2019a pas inclus la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe;\nle 20 d\u00e9cembre 2010, le vice-pr\u00e9sident des RH a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une communication \u00e0 l\u2019intention du syndicat pour lui signaler que le plaignant avait exerc\u00e9 les fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe du 20 octobre 2007 au 1er juillet 2010, date de sa destitution, et que ce dernier s\u2019\u00e9tait vu offrir le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe pour cette p\u00e9riode;\nle 5 janvier 2011, le syndicat a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au service des RH pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019il acceptait l\u2019offre au nom du plaignant et du syndicat;\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e a vers\u00e9 au plaignant la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration brute de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe de 14 566,09 $, moins les retenues, comme convenu.\n[45] En outre, m\u00eame si la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a avis\u00e9 le plaignant qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe est contest\u00e9e, quoi qu\u2019il en soit, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le grief en janvier 2010, soit sept mois avant qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9tende lui-m\u00eame qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab au courant \u00bb de sa destitution comme chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe en ao\u00fbt 2010. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019en janvier, il exer\u00e7ait toutes les fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une. Par cons\u00e9quent, en janvier 2010, lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le grief, le plaignant ne pouvait penser \u00e0 son \u00e9ventuelle destitution de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe par l\u2019intim\u00e9e; celle-ci ne pouvait donc faire partie du grief.\n[46] Il ressort d\u2019une lecture simple du grief que le sujet de ce dernier avait trait uniquement au fait que le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 et non \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge ou aux repr\u00e9sailles. Le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019offre du 20 d\u00e9cembre 2010 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e repose sur le principe que c\u2019\u00e9tait le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe qui \u00e9tait en cause et rien d\u2019autre, parce que l\u2019offre portait sur ce salaire et sur rien d\u2019autre.\n[47] Le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe n\u2019a pas suivi le m\u00eame cours que la plupart des chefs de dommages et r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9s par le plaignant : r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe; indemnisation pour pr\u00e9judice moral et pratique discriminatoire appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[48] La p\u00e9riode \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au paragraphe 77.3.viii de son EDP, qui demande [traduction] \u00ab une prime pour perte de revenu de 5 % \u00e0 titre de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe qui correspond \u00e0 environ 11 488,95 $ \u00bb, n\u2019est pas claire. Si, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019examen, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations relativement \u00e0 sa destitution comme chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et que le chef des dommages relatif au salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe chevauche la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a vers\u00e9 au plaignant le salaire de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe conform\u00e9ment au r\u00e8glement du grief, le Tribunal n\u2019ordonnera pas que le paiement soit effectu\u00e9 en double.\n[49] La question du refus d\u2019attribuer le poste d\u2019AIQA n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e. \u00c0 mon avis, elle semble faire partie d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge dont le plaignant aurait fait l\u2019objet. Je ne vois donc pas son inclusion dans la plainte initiale comme constituant un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[50] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura pas abus de proc\u00e9dure si le Tribunal fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019inclure les modifications contest\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale.\nXIV. \u00ab Situation essentielle \u00bb ou \u00ab lien \u00bb\nA. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[51] Outre les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus concernant les modifications contest\u00e9es, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que le poste d\u2019AIAQ aurait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une promotion pour le plaignant, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019une occasion de formation, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des autres incidents mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte initiale. Par cons\u00e9quent, les circonstances relatives au poste d\u2019AIAQ portaient sur une question diff\u00e9rente et constituaient une nouvelle plainte.\n[52] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que le poste d\u2019AIAQ n\u2019entre donc pas dans les cadres de la \u00ab situation essentielle \u00bb de la plainte initiale, situation qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, est comprise dans les trois pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents signal\u00e9s dans la plainte initiale, lesquels avaient tous trait aux possibilit\u00e9s de formation ou d\u2019affectation dans le cadre du poste occup\u00e9 par le plaignant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e cite le jugement Tran c Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 (Tran), o\u00f9 le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 des modifications parce que celles-ci n\u2019entraient pas dans les cadres de la \u00ab situation essentielle \u00bb de la plainte initiale de Mme Tran.\n[53] La destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe n\u2019entre pas non plus dans les cadres de la \u00ab situation essentielle \u00bb. De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es repr\u00e9sailles (que l\u2019intim\u00e9e qualifie de [traduction] \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles pr\u00e9existantes \u00bb (paragraphe 37, la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate) [traduction] \u00ab auraient pu et auraient d\u00fb \u00bb (idem) \u00eatre ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte initiale, mais ne l\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9. Elles sont donc exclues du \u00ab fond \u00bb de la plainte.\nB. La position du plaignant\n[54] Le plaignant soutient que le crit\u00e8re relatif aux modifications contest\u00e9es devrait consister \u00e0 savoir si les \u00ab [...] faits sont plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat des actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient survenus avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte \u00bb et que cela s\u2019applique lorsqu\u2019un plaignant all\u00e8gue une s\u00e9rie d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nements continus. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait de cet avis apr\u00e8s avoir tranch\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Parent, 2005 TCDP 37. Le plaignant soutient que la plainte initiale et la deuxi\u00e8me plainte font \u00e9tat d\u2019incidents continus de refus de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de lui offrir des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019affectation et de formation en raison d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Les modifications contest\u00e9es sont li\u00e9es aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements et \u00e0 la situation all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le plaignant dans la plainte initiale et en sont le r\u00e9sultat. Les modifications contest\u00e9es \u00e9tablissent l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien \u00e0 la plainte initiale et \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte puisqu\u2019elles font partie d\u2019une s\u00e9rie d\u2019actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le plaignant.\nC. Analyse\n[55] Dans Tran, la plainte initiale portait sur des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur la situation de famille et des repr\u00e9sailles faisant suite \u00e0 une plainte en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. Les modifications demand\u00e9es par Mme Tran avaient trait \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur le sexe, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique (retir\u00e9e par la suite), la race, la couleur et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi (Tran, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 10 et 11). Le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de [traduction] \u00ab [...] lien logique ou de lien [...] \u00bb entre les faits de la plainte initiale et [traduction] \u00ab [...] les all\u00e9gations d\u2019autres motifs de distinction illicites \u00bb dans les modifications demand\u00e9es (Tran, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 17). Au contraire, les modifications propos\u00e9es \u00e9taient tellement diff\u00e9rentes de la plainte initiale qu\u2019elles constituaient une [traduction] \u00ab plainte fondamentalement nouvelle \u00bb, et ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es.\n[56] Contrairement \u00e0 Tran, le fondement des all\u00e9gations de M. Blodgett, que ce soit dans la plainte initiale, la deuxi\u00e8me plainte ou les modifications contest\u00e9es, ne change pas : les all\u00e9gations ont toujours trait \u00e0 la discrimination et \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, en contravention avec l\u2019article 7. En outre, il all\u00e8gue que certains de ces actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles et du harc\u00e8lement aux termes de la Loi.\n[57] Que le crit\u00e8re pour faire droit aux modifications contest\u00e9es ait trait au fait que celles-ci fassent partie de la [traduction] \u00ab situation essentielle \u00bb de la plainte initiale ou que le crit\u00e8re ait trait au fait qu\u2019elles soient li\u00e9es aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments figurant dans la plainte initiale, si une s\u00e9rie d\u2019actes discriminatoires persistants est all\u00e9gu\u00e9, j\u2019estime que les modifications contest\u00e9es satisfont \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res. Le type de discrimination pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e dans les modifications contest\u00e9es \u2013 \u00e0 savoir, en fonction de l\u2019\u00e2ge \u2013 ne diff\u00e8re pas de la plainte initiale; le personnel de gestion concern\u00e9 est le m\u00eame; le groupe d\u2019employ\u00e9s faisant partie du groupe du plaignant n\u2019est pas modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante; les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s r\u00e9sultent toujours du m\u00eame type de situation en milieu de travail : le refus d\u2019offrir au plaignant des possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019affectation et de formation, pr\u00e9tendument en raison d\u2019actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Les repr\u00e9sailles et le harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9s r\u00e9sultent du m\u00eame motif de discrimination, sauf que les circonstances de certains des incidents constituent \u00e9galement du harc\u00e8lement et des repr\u00e9sailles, selon le plaignant. Les modifications contest\u00e9es semblent faire partie intrins\u00e8que de l\u2019expos\u00e9 de tous les faits et, si elles \u00e9taient exclues, le Tribunal ne pourrait pas \u00e9valuer enti\u00e8rement la preuve des parties ou obtenir un expos\u00e9 complet des plaintes.\nXV. Observations \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019audience concernant trois affaires\nA. La position du plaignant\n[58] Le plaignant fait valoir que la d\u00e9cision Air Canada (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) d\u00e9fend l\u2019id\u00e9e selon laquelle c\u2019est la lettre de renvoi que la Commission a transmise au Tribunal, ainsi que la plainte qui y est jointe, qui d\u00e9termine si la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de la plainte et non le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate ou d\u2019autres documents de la Commission. Si cette derni\u00e8re veut limiter la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte, elle emploiera une formulation pr\u00e9cise \u00e0 cette fin.\n[59] Par cons\u00e9quent, parce que la plainte initiale all\u00e8gue une [traduction] \u00ab tendance \u00bb \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, toute all\u00e9gation qui s\u2019y rapporte se rattache \u00e0 la plainte et les modifications contest\u00e9es aussi.\n[60] Le plaignant soutient que le type de modifications qu\u2019il demande est le m\u00eame que celui que le plaignant dans Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir, du fait que la plainte initiale et les modifications demand\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 et sont li\u00e9es par un \u00ab facteur commun \u00bb - dans Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) : l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du plaignant; dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte : les actes discriminatoires fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, dont certains constituaient des repr\u00e9sailles et du harc\u00e8lement en vertu de la Loi.\n[61] Le plaignant fait valoir que la d\u00e9cision ACET (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) appuie la proposition selon laquelle le Tribunal devrait faire droit aux modifications qui rectifient les erreurs de la Commission, si aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est caus\u00e9.\n[62] Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la Commission a donn\u00e9 un conseil erron\u00e9 au plaignant [que la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe ne pouvait constituer des repr\u00e9sailles en vertu de la Loi et qu\u2019il devait d\u00e9poser une plainte distincte, et c\u2019est pourquoi il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte] et, parce qu\u2019aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e si le Tribunal inclut les modifications contest\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale, le Tribunal devrait appliquer la d\u00e9cision ACET et faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en modification.\nB. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[63] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la d\u00e9cision Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) d\u00e9fend la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de justice naturelle \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00e0 une plainte. Elle fait valoir que, en ce qui concerne l\u2019autorisation de modifications, la d\u00e9cision Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) appuie l\u2019exigence selon laquelle aucun pr\u00e9judice ne doit \u00eatre caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour qu\u2019une modification soit autoris\u00e9e.\n[64] L\u2019ajout des modifications contest\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte initiale \u00e0 ce stade du processus occasionnera des frais suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et paralysera le processus en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9judice et causera une injustice \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re fait valoir que, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), l\u2019inclusion des modifications contest\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale causerait un pr\u00e9judice fondamental, irr\u00e9parable et injuste.\n[65] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la d\u00e9cision Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) confirme \u00e9galement que le crit\u00e8re pour autoriser une modification est que celle-ci doit faire partie de la m\u00eame [traduction] \u00ab situation essentielle \u00bb mise en \u00e9vidence dans la plainte.\n[66] L\u2019intim\u00e9e consid\u00e8re que les d\u00e9cisions Air Canada et ACET (toutes deux pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es) sont des exemples de la fa\u00e7on dont les modifications demand\u00e9es doivent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment trait\u00e9es ou relev\u00e9es par la Commission pour que le Tribunal puisse les ajouter \u00e0 une plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que, parce que les modifications contest\u00e9es n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es en particulier d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ou d\u2019une autre par la Commission, elles ne peuvent faire partie du renvoi de la Commission au Tribunal.\nC. Analyse\n[67] Je juge que la d\u00e9cision Air Canada (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) d\u00e9fend le principe, \u00e0 moins que la Commission en limite clairement la port\u00e9e, adopt\u00e9 par cette derni\u00e8re pour renvoyer l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original] d\u2019une plainte au Tribunal, nonobstant les recommandations d\u2019un enqu\u00eateur de la Commission visant \u00e0 exclure certaines des all\u00e9gations avanc\u00e9es par le plaignant.\n[68] \u00c0 mon avis, dans la d\u00e9cision CTEA (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale confirme que la jurisprudence dit clairement \u00ab [\u2026] que le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence de modifier les plaintes de discrimination \u00bb (CTEA, au paragraphe 30). Elle confirme \u00e9galement que, m\u00eame si la d\u00e9cision d\u2019autoriser une modification est discr\u00e9tionnaire, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une modification doit \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00ab [\u2026] lorsque la partie adverse n\u2019en subit aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00bb (CTEA, au paragraphe 31).\n[69] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Parent (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e) appuie la proposition selon laquelle les modifications qui sont li\u00e9es par des similitudes \u2013 le \u00ab facteur commun \u00bb - aux all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte initiale devraient \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es, sauf lorsqu\u2019un pr\u00e9judice est caus\u00e9 aux autres parties. La d\u00e9cision Parent confirme aussi le pouvoir du Tribunal de modifier les plaintes \u00ab [...] aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb (Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30). Dans Parent, m\u00eame si la Commission n\u2019avait pas trait\u00e9 en particulier la modification demand\u00e9e, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de modifier la plainte.\n[70] Je conclus qu\u2019il existe, tout comme dans Parent, un facteur commun entre les modifications contest\u00e9es et la plainte initiale. Comme dans Air Canada, le fait d\u2019inclure les modifications contest\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale fera en sorte que l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de la plainte sera port\u00e9e devant le Tribunal.\nXVI. La question du pr\u00e9judice\n[71] Dans Parent, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [\u2026] la modification de la plainte ne devrait pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e si elle cause un pr\u00e9judice injuste \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie \u00bb (Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 16)\nA. La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[72] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 deux ann\u00e9es et demie avant que le plaignant signale la destitution de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et deux ann\u00e9es avant qu\u2019il ne signale l\u2019incident relatif au poste d\u2019AIAQ et qu\u2019il ne demande les modifications en question. Ces d\u00e9lais ont intrins\u00e8quement et fondamentalement caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui a perdu l\u2019occasion de recueillir et de conserver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, aussi bien les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaires que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par des t\u00e9moins dont les souvenirs se sont estomp\u00e9s. Cette perte ne peut jamais \u00eatre compens\u00e9e. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a perdu l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations [traduction] \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb.\n[73] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait aussi valoir que ces d\u00e9lais signifient que la Commission n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suite comme il convient \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations, qui n\u2019ont m\u00eame pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le fait d\u2019autoriser les modifications contest\u00e9es constituerait un [traduction] \u00ab contournement \u00bb du processus n\u00e9cessaire de la Commission et priverait l\u2019intim\u00e9e des proc\u00e9dures d\u2019enqu\u00eate et de conciliation de cette derni\u00e8re.\nB. La position du plaignant\n[74] Le plaignant soutient que la partie invoquant un pr\u00e9judice doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice \u00ab effectivement subi \u00bb qui est [traduction] \u00ab assez important pour nuire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience \u00bb comme dans Cook c Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 TCDP CanLII 45929 (Cook c Onion Lake).\n[75] Le plaignant fait observer que le d\u00e9lai en soi n\u2019est pas \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 un pr\u00e9judice. Il nie de toute fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il y ait eu un d\u00e9lai, parce que, le plus t\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s que le plaignant a fait appel \u00e0 un avocat, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate \u2013 en m\u00eame temps que son EDP, soit en d\u00e9cembre 2012. L\u2019intim\u00e9e est donc au courant des modifications contest\u00e9es au moins depuis cette date.\nC. Analyse\n[76] J\u2019ignore \u00e0 quelle \u00e9tape du processus de la Commission en \u00e9tait rendue la deuxi\u00e8me plainte lorsque cette derni\u00e8re a re\u00e7u les consentements du plaignant et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au renvoi imm\u00e9diat devant le Tribunal, mais le consentement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e indique une volont\u00e9 de se priver des processus de la Commission dans certaines circonstances. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable que l\u2019intim\u00e9e traite la deuxi\u00e8me plainte comme elle l\u2019a fait et qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas soulev\u00e9 la question du pr\u00e9judice. Je conclus que, dans ces circonstances \u00e9galement, comme dans Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le fait que certains des processus de la Commission puissent \u00eatre court-circuit\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9quivaudra pas \u00e0 un [traduction] \u00ab contournement \u00bb des processus de la Commission et ne causera pas un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Chaque fois qu\u2019elles en ont besoin, le Tribunal permet aux parties d\u2019assister \u00e0 des s\u00e9ances de m\u00e9diation et d\u2019engager des discussions de conciliation. Celles-ci ne sont pas seulement offertes par la Commission.\n[77] En outre, en plus de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, j\u2019ai pris en consid\u00e9ration le fait que le m\u00eame personnel de gestion qui a pris part aux d\u00e9cisions de d\u00e9mettre le plaignant de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et de ne pas lui offrir le poste d\u2019AIAQ est encore \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et qu\u2019il peut t\u00e9moigner, notamment \u00e0 l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement pris en consid\u00e9ration le fait que la deuxi\u00e8me plainte qualifie de mesure de repr\u00e9sailles la destitution des fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte depuis environ octobre 2012. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e savait depuis d\u00e9cembre 2012 que le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de modifier la plainte. L\u2019EDP de l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut r\u00e9pondre aux modifications contest\u00e9es (ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la plainte initiale et \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte) et l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut aussi fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaires \u00e0 leur sujet. En outre, afin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les inconv\u00e9nients que l\u2019autorisation des modifications pourrait causer \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Tribunal peut accorder \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire pour d\u00e9poser son EDP et des documents.\n[78] Je conclus donc que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice si les modifications contest\u00e9es sont autoris\u00e9es et que le fait de les autoriser ne nuira pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience.\n[79] Je tiens \u00e0 signaler que l\u2019accueil de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en modification ne change pas le fardeau qui incombe au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer le bien-fond\u00e9 de ses all\u00e9gations, y compris des modifications, lors de l\u2019audience. Comme la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 dans Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e (au paragraphe 14), le plaignant \u00ab [...] aura le fardeau de prouver [\u2026] \u00bb ses all\u00e9gations \u00ab [\u2026] par la suite \u00bb.\nXVII. Ordonnance\nAvec le consentement des parties, la plainte initiale est modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019ajout de la deuxi\u00e8me plainte.\nLa plainte initiale est modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019ajout des modifications contest\u00e9es, ainsi qu\u2019il est plus particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la requ\u00eate en modification du plaignant aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 25.\nSi, \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019examen, le plaignant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avait d\u00e9mis de ses fonctions de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe pour des motifs de distinction illicites fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge ou en guise de repr\u00e9sailles, en contravention avec la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le plaignant n\u2019aura pas droit \u00e0 une ordonnance exigeant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui verse la prime de cinq p. 100 (5 %) relative \u00e0 son travail \u00e0 titre de chef d\u2019\u00e9quipe pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 27 octobre 2007 au 1er juillet 2010, et le Tribunal ne rend pas une telle ordonnance.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e doit signifier et d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte initiale, ainsi qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par les pr\u00e9sentes, au plus tard dans les six (6) semaines suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nLe plaignant doit signifier et d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9plique \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au plus tard dans les dix (10) jours suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019avocat du plaignant re\u00e7oit la signification de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nOlga Luftig\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n3 octobre 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossiers du tribunal :\nT1866\/9612 & T1947\/2713\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nBrian Blodgett c.

Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, au paragraphe 18).\n[3] Le 17 septembre 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne prenait pas position en ce qui concerne la requ\u00eate en modification de la plaignante, sauf pour ce qui est de la modification propos\u00e9e \u00e0 la mesure de redressement no 11 figurant dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[4] La mesure de redressement no 11 figurant dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante est ainsi libell\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nToute autre mesure de redressement que je peux demander au Tribunal et qu\u2019il peut accorder.\n[5] La plaignante souhaite ajouter \u00e0 cette mesure de redressement la phrase soulign\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous :\n[traduction]\nToute autre mesure de redressement que je peux demander au Tribunal et qu\u2019il peut accorder.

Toute autre modification propos\u00e9e devra \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par voie de requ\u00eate, puis analys\u00e9e par le Tribunal sur le fondement des observations des parties. Cela permet \u00e0 chacune des parties d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la question.

L\u2019article 6 des R\u00e8gles est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi :\nd) les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u2013 pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 \u2013 et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle;\n[6] Selon la Commission, le seuil \u00e0 franchir est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour ce qui est de la pertinence, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire une divulgation compl\u00e8te.\n[7] Dans son m\u00e9moire, la Commission cite aussi des d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande de divulgation, notamment Tannis et al. c. Calvary Publishing Corp and Glen Robbins, 2000 BCHRT 26, 38 C.H.R.R. D\/277, au paragraphe 44, Brady c. Interior Health Authority, 2005 BCHRT 200 (CHRR Doc. 05-246), aux paragraphes 51 et 54, et Metcalf. c. International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 882 and others (No.7), 2005 BCHRT 165, au paragraphe 11 (onglets 6, 7 et 8 du m\u00e9moire de la Commission);\n[8] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, qui \u00e9tablissent les r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle, sont cruciales pour ce qui est de la demande.\n[9] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission relativement aux alin\u00e9as 11b) et d), je conclus que les demandes s\u2019apparentent davantage \u00e0 des demandes de communication pr\u00e9alable qu\u2019\u00e0 des demandes de divulgation. En outre, je conclus que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni les renseignements que la Commission demande dans les observations qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la Commission.\n[10] La question non r\u00e9gl\u00e9e figurant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11e) de la requ\u00eate en divulgation de la Commission vise assur\u00e9ment des documents qu\u2019il convient de divulguer \u00e0 la Commission et aux plaignants.\n[11] Le Tribunal ordonne donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer \u00e0 la Commission et aux plaignants tout document, \u00e9lectronique ou autre, li\u00e9 \u00e0 la restriction relative au recours aux calumets et aux c\u00e9r\u00e9monies de purification dans les installations de Service correctionnel Canada, notamment \u00e0 la tenue de c\u00e9r\u00e9monies de purification dans les cellules.\nSign\u00e9e par\nGeorge E.

La plainte et la demande de directives [1] Le plaignant soutient que les Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk ont re\u00e7u et continuent \u00e0 recevoir des services de maintien de l\u2019ordre de qualit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure aux services qui sont fournis aux collectivit\u00e9s non autochtones du Canada. Selon le plaignant, cela constitue un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019origine ethnique, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi).\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate vise \u00e0 fournir des directives aux parties au sujet des questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es qui sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 la divulgation de documents.\nII. Le contexte [3] Le 1er octobre 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance obligeant l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires et de meilleures qualit\u00e9s.\n[4] La pr\u00e9sentation des observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate a pris fin le 16 novembre 2012. Dans le but d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le processus de divulgation, le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires que le plaignant demandait, les motifs de l\u2019ordonnance devant \u00eatre fournis ult\u00e9rieurement :\n[traduction]\n1. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents demand\u00e9s par les plaignants dans le tableau A de leur dossier de requ\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, ou confirmer que les documents demand\u00e9s n\u2019existent pas.\na. Pour ce qui est des documents demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a) du tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate des plaignants dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents qui d\u00e9crivent le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es qui re\u00e7oivent les services de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la GRC). Cette obligation vaut pour les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la GRC; les niveaux de dotation et de financement pour chaque collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9loign\u00e9e ou isol\u00e9e n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nb. Pour ce qui est des documents demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) du tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate des plaignants dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents qui d\u00e9crivent le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es qui font appel \u00e0 des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui rel\u00e8vent de la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cette obligation vaut pour les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale relatifs \u00e0 la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations; les niveaux de dotation et de financement de chaque service de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nc. Pour ce qui est des documents demand\u00e9s au paragraphe 11 du tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate des plaignants dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents d\u00e9crivant les normes adopt\u00e9es par la GRC en mati\u00e8re de niveaux de service, d\u2019installations, d\u2019\u00e9quipement, de salaires, d\u2019avantages sociaux et d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9loignement, ainsi que toute norme en mati\u00e8re de maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es. Cette obligation vaut pour les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la GRC; les normes s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations ou d\u2019autres collectivit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es.\n2. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents en sa possession qui ont trait, pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 2007 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, \u00e0 un fait, \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 une mesure de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties, ou encore confirmer que les documents demand\u00e9s n\u2019existent pas.\n3. En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles), l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit transmettre aux autres parties une liste globale des documents qui sont en sa possession et pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9. Cette liste globale doit inclure tous les documents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et tous les documents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qui seront divulgu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 1 et 2 de l\u2019ordonnance.\n4. En application du paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit fournir aux autres parties une copie de chaque document \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la liste globale d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 3 de l\u2019ordonnance. Chaque document fourni devra porter un titre ou une indication renvoyant clairement \u00e0 la liste globale de documents, afin que les plaignants puissent facilement identifier et consulter le document.\n5. Les documents fournis conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019ordonnance ne doivent pas \u00eatre caviard\u00e9s. Si certains documents ne peuvent pas \u00eatre fournis dans leur version int\u00e9grale, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra expliquer pourquoi.\n6. En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) et du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit transmettre aux autres parties une liste globale des documents qui sont en sa possession et pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit fournir une explication pour chaque privil\u00e8ge qui est invoqu\u00e9. Cette liste globale doit inclure tous les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et tous les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 qui seront divulgu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 1 et 2 de l\u2019ordonnance.\n7. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit se conformer aux paragraphes 1 \u00e0 6 de l\u2019ordonnance au plus tard le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[5] Les motifs de l\u2019ordonnance, Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk et Grand Chef Stan Louttit en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2013 TCDP 3 [Louttit], ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus par le Tribunal le 16 janvier 2013.\n[6] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2013, soit la date fix\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans l\u2019ordonnance du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012 pour la divulgation des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires demand\u00e9s par le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 une prorogation au 15 mars 2013 du d\u00e9lai qu\u2019il avait pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance. Comme le plaignant et la Commission ne s\u2019y opposaient pas, la prorogation a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le Tribunal.\n[7] Pr\u00e9sumant que la divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e le 15 mars 2013, le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance au 19 avril 2013 pour traiter d\u2019autres questions relatives au dossier en vue de l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire. Cependant, le 18 avril 2013, le plaignant a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour l\u2019aviser que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne lui avait pas encore fourni les autres documents qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tenu de divulguer suivant l\u2019ordonnance que le Tribunal avait rendue le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, et il a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 soit impos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[8] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison de la quantit\u00e9 de documents vis\u00e9s et de la complexit\u00e9 de la t\u00e2che, il avait besoin de plus de temps pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012 et terminer le processus de divulgation. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a dit qu\u2019il communiquerait les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires au plus tard le 17 mai 2013.\n[9] Le plaignant a accept\u00e9 de ne pas donner suite \u00e0 sa demande d\u2019imposition d\u2019une p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour non-respect de l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, \u00e0 condition que l\u2019intim\u00e9 fasse une divulgation compl\u00e8te au plus tard le 17 mai 2013.\n[10] Le 21 mai 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a divulgu\u00e9 les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires aux parties et a fourni une liste globale des documents qu\u2019il avait divulgu\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la liste globale, ou autrement, lesquels des documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et lesquels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012.\n[11] Le 19 juin 2013, dans le but d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer les choses, et vu que les parties n\u2019avaient pas, depuis mai 2013, donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la question du respect de l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance soit pr\u00e9vue pour le d\u00e9but juillet ou la mi-septembre 2013. La tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e au 16 septembre 2013 pour traiter de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019avancement de la divulgation et des questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, ainsi que pour mettre au point les derniers d\u00e9tails concernant la tenue d\u2019une audience.\n[12] Avant la tenue de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance, en d\u00e9but d\u2019apr\u00e8s\u2011midi le 16 septembre 2013, le plaignant a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, il demanderait \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer, au moyen d\u2019une liste, comment il avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance que le Tribunal avait rendue le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Le plaignant n\u2019avait pas encore fini d\u2019examiner la trousse de documents divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9, mais il a dit qu\u2019il semblait manquer beaucoup de documents. Le plaignant a laiss\u00e9 entendre qu\u2019une fois que l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui aurait dit quels documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, il serait plus en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re satisfaisant de la trousse de documents divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[13] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance tenue le 16 septembre 2013, l\u2019avocat du plaignant et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont accept\u00e9 de discuter des questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es portant sur la divulgation. Le Tribunal a encourag\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 soulever les questions le plus rapidement possible et a fix\u00e9 une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance au 3 octobre 2013 pour avoir des nouvelles des parties.\n[14] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance au 3 octobre 2013, le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait encore des questions au sujet des documents divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et que les parties ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 r\u00e9gler ces questions.\nIII. La position des parties [15] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance du 3 octobre 2013, les parties ont dit quelle \u00e9tait leur position quant \u00e0 la meilleure fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9gler les questions de divulgation qui se posent dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[16] En se fondant sur son examen initial des documents fournis par l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il semble manquer des documents. Toutefois, il est difficile pour le plaignant d\u2019en \u00eatre certain si l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9cise pas quels documents, selon lui, r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant demande \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer, au moyen d\u2019une liste, comment il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2013 TCDP 3. Selon le plaignant, une fois que l\u2019intim\u00e9 lui aura dit quels documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, il sera plus en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re satisfaisant de la trousse de documents divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[17] Selon le plaignant, il s\u2019agirait de la fa\u00e7on la plus efficace de r\u00e9gler les questions de divulgation. Les personnes qui ont rassembl\u00e9 les documents pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 seraient mieux plac\u00e9es pour pr\u00e9ciser quels documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal que le plaignant, qui devrait le deviner, probablement par ce que ces personnes ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 accompli une telle t\u00e2che lorsqu\u2019elles ont rassembl\u00e9 les documents \u00e0 divulguer. De m\u00eame, le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il serait beaucoup moins ardu pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019indiquer quels documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal qu\u2019il le serait pour le plaignant d\u2019essayer de d\u00e9terminer quels documents il peut manquer. Cela s\u2019explique en partie par le fait qu\u2019en raison de l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u00e9sordonn\u00e9 de la communication pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de documents par l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant est incapable de d\u00e9terminer lesquels des documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment et lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s maintenant, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal.\n[18] Le plaignant ajoute que, bien que, dans les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03\u201105\u201104) du Tribunal, il n\u2019y ait pas de r\u00e8gle exigeant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 dresse une liste pr\u00e9cisant comment il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour donner une telle directive pour veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction se d\u00e9roule de mani\u00e8re ordonn\u00e9e et exp\u00e9ditive.\n[19] Subsidiairement, le plaignant d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il pourrait pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en vue de la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Toutefois, selon lui, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on moins efficace de r\u00e9gler les questions de divulgation.\n[20] La Commission souligne que, quelle que soit la proc\u00e9dure suivie pour r\u00e9gler les questions de divulgation dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u2013 que l\u2019on ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer, au moyen d\u2019une liste, comment il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal ou bien, subsidiairement, que le plaignant pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00eate \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u2013 l\u2019intim\u00e9 sera tenu d\u2019expliquer comment il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation rendue par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2013 TCDP 3. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rassembl\u00e9 les documents pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, la Commission soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est mieux plac\u00e9 pour dire quels documents il a fournis pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance, vraisemblablement sans devoir y consacrer beaucoup d\u2019efforts.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9 invite quant \u00e0 lui le plaignant \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser quels documents, selon lui, sont manquants ou insatisfaisants. Une fois que le plaignant aura fourni ces pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourra alors faire des recherches et dire s\u2019il existe d\u2019autres documents. Contrairement au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019il devra d\u00e9ployer beaucoup d\u2019efforts pour passer en revue les documents divulgu\u00e9s, lire chacun des documents, d\u00e9terminer lesquels d\u2019entre eux sont de nouveaux documents, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 quel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal ils permettent de r\u00e9pondre. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, il serait plus pratique et \u00e9conomique pour le plaignant de passer en revue les documents divulgu\u00e9s et de pr\u00e9ciser quels sont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments insatisfaisants. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne mette pas en doute la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019a le Tribunal pour donner les directives demand\u00e9es par le plaignant, il dit que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019une telle chose se produit.\nIV. Les directives [22] Dans son ordonnance du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires demand\u00e9s par le plaignant. Le Tribunal a aussi ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire une liste globale de tous les documents divulgu\u00e9s au plaignant, y compris tous les documents divulgu\u00e9s au plaignant suivant la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la production de la liste globale pour les motifs suivants :\nLa production d\u2019un CD dont le contenu n\u2019est pas structur\u00e9, qui n\u2019a pas de table des mati\u00e8res et qui renferme des documents non class\u00e9s nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des plaignants d\u2019invoquer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 estime pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ou de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ceux-ci. De plus, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9sorganisation du premier CD de divulgation a fait que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve n\u2019ont pas pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace. Les parties en sont encore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des divulgations, et ce, depuis mars 2012. Certes, le premier CD de divulgations d\u00e9sorganis\u00e9 n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas la seule cause de ce retard, mais il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 que certains documents exig\u00e9s au moyen de la requ\u00eate en cause ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis aux plaignants. Peut-\u00eatre que si les documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 produits plus efficacement d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, la requ\u00eate en cause \u2013 ou au moins certains de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u2013 n\u2019aurait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire et l\u2019instance aurait peut-\u00eatre progress\u00e9 plus rapidement.\n(Louttit, au paragraphe 14)\n[23] Des questions semblables ont de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente demande de directives. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 se soit conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal lui enjoignant de produire une liste globale de documents, \u00e0 elle seule, la liste globale ne permet pas au plaignant de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a respect\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment principal de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, \u00e0 savoir la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je souligne que l\u2019ordonnance du 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012 rendue par le Tribunal pr\u00e9voyait ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\n1. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents demand\u00e9s par les plaignants dans le tableau A de leur dossier de requ\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, ou confirmer que les documents demand\u00e9s n\u2019existent pas.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[24] Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser quels documents suppl\u00e9mentaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la demande du plaignant, il \u00e9tait implicite dans les directives qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9ciserait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelconque comment il s\u2019\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal pour divulguer les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser si les documents demand\u00e9s existaient ou non, celui\u2011ci demande maintenant au plaignant d\u2019indiquer quels documents, selon lui, sont manquants ou insuffisants. Cela n\u2019est pas compatible avec l\u2019intention de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal ou avec la divulgation en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral :\nBien que les R\u00e8gles ne pr\u00e9cisent pas la mani\u00e8re ou la forme que doit prendre la divulgation, l\u2019objet des r\u00e8gles et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigent que la divulgation et la production de documents soient suffisantes pour que chaque partie ait la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre.\n(Louttit, au paragraphe 14)\n[25] Ni la Loi ni les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (03\u201105\u201104) du Tribunal ne traitent express\u00e9ment de la situation dont il est question dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente demande de directives. Cependant, en l\u2019absence d\u2019une directive pr\u00e9cise pr\u00e9vue par la loi, il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure. Pour d\u00e9cider de la proc\u00e9dure qu\u2019il convient de suivre dans une telle situation, je tiens compte du fait que, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, l\u2019instruction des plaintes doit se faire sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[26] \u00c0 ce stade\u2011ci de l\u2019instance, le plaignant n\u2019est pas en mesure de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires que le Tribunal a rendue le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Cette ordonnance obligeait l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer des documents pour donner au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de s\u2019exprimer. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas enti\u00e8rement acquitt\u00e9 de cette obligation. Comme c\u2019est lui qui a rassembl\u00e9 les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, il est \u00e9galement mieux plac\u00e9 que le plaignant pour pr\u00e9ciser comment ces documents r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal et \u00e0 la demande de divulgation du plaignant. Il n\u2019est pas rare que des parties bien averties, comme le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, soient en mesure de cerner leur propre divulgation et d\u2019indiquer comment celle\u2011ci leur permet de se conformer \u00e0 une ordonnance du Tribunal en mati\u00e8re de divulgation. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait incapable de le faire, il serait difficile, voire impossible, pour le Tribunal et les autres parties de s\u2019assurer du respect d\u2019une ordonnance de divulgation.\n[27] J\u2019estime donc que la fa\u00e7on la plus simple de r\u00e9gler la question de la divulgation qui se pose serait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise quels documents il a communiqu\u00e9s pour se conformer \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Bien que cela puisse causer des inconv\u00e9nients pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der n\u2019a aucune incidence sur le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 une audience \u00e9quitable dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\n(1) L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit informer par \u00e9crit le Tribunal et toutes les parties, sans \u00e9quivoque, comment il s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il doit pr\u00e9ciser quels documents suppl\u00e9mentaires il a fournis le 21 mai 2013 et comment ces documents r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 chacune des demandes dans le tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate du plaignant dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012.\n(2) L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit donner suite \u00e0 la directive no 1 susmentionn\u00e9e d\u2019ici le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2013.\n(3) Dans un d\u00e9lai de quatre semaines suivant la r\u00e9ception de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la directive no 1 susmentionn\u00e9e, le plaignant doit laisser savoir, par \u00e9crit, au Tribunal et \u00e0 toutes les parties s\u2019il y a des questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es en ce qui concerne le respect par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012.\n(4) Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la r\u00e9ponse du plaignant relativement \u00e0 la directive no 3, une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique sera fix\u00e9e pour traiter des questions non r\u00e9gl\u00e9es et tenter de fixer des dates pour la tenue d\u2019une audience.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 17 octobre 2013",

Le plaignant et la requ\u00eate. 1\nII........... La demande de documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience. 1\nIII......... La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. 3\nI. Le plaignant et la requ\u00eate [1] Le plaignant est d\u00e9tenu dans une prison f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et est sous la garde de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue \u00eatre atteint de plusieurs d\u00e9ficiences mentales. Il soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9 des lignes de conduite qui sont discriminatoires envers les d\u00e9tenus ayant des d\u00e9ficiences mentales et qui ne tiennent pas compte de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e de leurs besoins. Dans ce contexte, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi), en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] En vue de la tenue de l\u2019audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate par laquelle il demandait que tous les documents \u00e0 l\u2019audience soient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s sous forme \u00e9lectronique. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate porte sur la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nII. La demande de documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience [3] D\u2019habitude, lorsque le Tribunal tient une audience \u00e0 laquelle la Commission participe, si une partie souhaite produire un document en preuve, celle-ci doit avoir en main cinq copies du document en question : une copie pour chacune des deux autres parties, une copie pour le t\u00e9moin, une copie pour le greffe du Tribunal et une copie pour le membre instructeur du Tribunal.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande que tous les documents \u00e0 l\u2019audience soient sous forme \u00e9lectronique. Subsidiairement, il demande l\u2019autorisation de fournir deux copies seulement, et non pas cinq, des documents qu\u2019il souhaite produire en preuve. Cela permettrait au Tribunal d\u2019avoir les deux copies papier qui lui sont habituellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, et les parties et le t\u00e9moin pourraient utiliser les documents \u00e9lectroniques. Ces derniers pourraient, s\u2019ils le d\u00e9sirent, imprimer \u00e0 leurs propres frais les documents qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis sous forme \u00e9lectronique.\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 produit environ 5 500 documents et qu\u2019il pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019il devra en produire plus de 9 000 avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 estime qu\u2019il lui en co\u00fbterait environ 20 000 $ pour produire cinq copies papier de tous ces documents. Il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas n\u00e9cessaire de produire tous ces documents en preuve, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e8gue que, m\u00eame s\u2019il ne produit qu\u2019une fraction des documents, cela serait suffisant pour ne pas utiliser les reliures et les copies papier traditionnelles. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme en outre qu\u2019il faudrait aussi tenir compte des frais de transport, d\u2019entreposage et de gestion de cinq copies papier de ces documents, ce qui viendrait ajouter quelques milliers de dollars de plus \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 des frais support\u00e9s.\n[6] Pour r\u00e9duire ces frais, l\u2019intim\u00e9 offre de fournir, \u00e0 ses frais, un \u00e9cran de projection, que toutes les parties pourront utiliser pour afficher les documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il est \u00e9galement pr\u00eat \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 la disposition des t\u00e9moins un ordinateur dans lequel auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s tous les documents \u00e9lectroniques. L\u2019intim\u00e9 propose \u00e9galement de verser des copies PDF de tous les documents sur l\u2019ordinateur portatif de chacune des parties afin qu\u2019elles puissent les utiliser \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Tous les documents, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de copies \u00e9lectroniques ou de copies papier, seraient nomm\u00e9s et num\u00e9rot\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Par exemple, les documents papier auraient comme num\u00e9ro d\u2019onglet 001, 002, 003, et ainsi de suite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10 000, alors que les documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique seraient enregistr\u00e9s sous le nom 001, 002, 003, et ainsi de suite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 10 000. Par cons\u00e9quent, le document \u00e9lectronique 8346 serait le m\u00eame que le document figurant \u00e0 l\u2019onglet 8346 dans un ensemble de reliures.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9lectroniques ne cause pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 aucune des parties, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que chaque partie peut imprimer, \u00e0 ses propres frais, les documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 si elle le souhaite. Compte tenu du principe de la proportionnalit\u00e9, du montant maximum pouvant \u00eatre accord\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53e) de la Loi et de la r\u00e9duction vis\u00e9e des frais support\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instance pour toutes les parties, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e0 produire cinq copies de ses documents \u00e0 l\u2019audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[8] Le plaignant et la Commission s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ils soutiennent que les documents divulgu\u00e9s ne seront pas tous produits en preuve. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Commission souligne que, pour arriver \u00e0 la somme de 20 000 $ qu\u2019il avance, l\u2019intim\u00e9 tient pour acquis que tous les documents qu\u2019il a divulgu\u00e9s devront \u00eatre produits en preuve, ce qui n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement le cas. Le m\u00eame raisonnement s\u2019applique aux frais suppl\u00e9mentaires qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, devront \u00eatre support\u00e9s pour le transport, l\u2019entreposage et la gestion des documents. La Commission est \u00e9galement d\u2019avis que la somme pouvant \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9judice moral suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53e) de la Loi n\u2019est pas pertinente pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[9] La Commission et le plaignant craignent que l\u2019utilisation de documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience nuise \u00e0 leur capacit\u00e9 de trouver facilement les documents tant lors du contre\u2011interrogatoire que lors de la pr\u00e9paration. La Commission ajoute que la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle il fournirait des copies PDF des documents ne tient pas compte du besoin de trouver facilement ces documents \u00e0 l\u2019audience. De plus, la Commission souligne que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas abord\u00e9 la question du soutien technique en cas de mauvais fonctionnement du projecteur ou de l\u2019ordinateur de pr\u00e9sentation propos\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019audience.\n[10] La Commission all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas d\u00e9crit comment la pratique \u00e9tablie concernant la production de pi\u00e8ces papier nuirait \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments. Selon la Commission et le plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourrait r\u00e9duire ses frais en produisant un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, en imprimant des documents recto verso et en fournissant une seule copie des documents au Tribunal.\nIII. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [11] Le Tribunal ne dispose pas de r\u00e8gles ni de lignes directrices en ce qui concerne l\u2019utilisation de documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience. En l\u2019absence de telles directives, le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, \u00e0 condition que celle\u2011ci respecte les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 (voir Prassad c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 560, aux pages 568 et 569). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que l\u2019instruction des plaintes doit se faire sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[12] La demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant l\u2019utilisation de documents \u00e9lectroniques est fond\u00e9e sur les co\u00fbts. D\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fait valoir que l\u2019utilisation de documents papier nuirait \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments. De l\u2019autre, le plaignant et la Commission ont soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations l\u00e9gitimes concernant la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser des documents \u00e9lectroniques. On ne peut pas lib\u00e9rer le plaignant et la Commission de leurs pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en leur demandant simplement d\u2019imprimer des copies papier des documents \u00e0 leurs propres frais. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, en demandant au plaignant et \u00e0 la Commission de proc\u00e9der ainsi, on transf\u00e8re seulement les frais d\u2019une partie aux deux autres.\n[13] Comme le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas accept\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser les documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience et ont soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et comme le Tribunal n\u2019a pas de r\u00e8gles ni de lignes directrices concernant l\u2019utilisation de documents \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 l\u2019audience, la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ne peut pas \u00eatre accueillie en totalit\u00e9. Le Tribunal ne peut pas permettre aux pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des co\u00fbts de l\u2019emporter sur son mandat de veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019audience soit \u00e9quitable.\n[14] Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait certaines propositions pratiques pour r\u00e9duire la quantit\u00e9 de documents qui pourraient \u00eatre requis \u00e0 l\u2019audience de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, soit l\u2019impression recto verso des documents, de m\u00eame que la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et d\u2019un recueil conjoint de documents. J\u2019encourage les parties \u00e0 se pr\u00e9valoir de ces options pour r\u00e9duire les frais que les parties sont susceptibles de supporter relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instance.\n[15] Je suis \u00e9galement pr\u00eate \u00e0 r\u00e9duire le nombre de copies de documents devant \u00eatre produites \u00e0 l\u2019audience en le faisant passer de cinq \u00e0 trois (une copie pour chacune des parties adverses et une copie pour le dossier du Tribunal). Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 souhaite encore pr\u00e9senter ses arguments sous forme \u00e9lectronique, je pourrais suivre au moyen de la preuve \u00e9lectronique de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Si j\u2019ai besoin d\u2019avoir une copie papier de certains documents \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience, je demanderai \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de me la fournir.\n[16] Je tiens \u00e0 souligner que, comme il est pr\u00e9vu que l\u2019affaire soit entendue en blocs d\u2019une semaine non cons\u00e9cutifs, il est fort peu probable que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait besoin de la totalit\u00e9 de sa preuve chaque semaine. En apportant seulement les documents dont il peut avoir besoin pour chacune des semaines d\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9 peut aussi \u00eatre capable de r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au transport, \u00e0 l\u2019entreposage et \u00e0 la gestion de ces documents.\n[17] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessus, je rejette la requ\u00eate que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vue de produire sa preuve uniquement sous forme \u00e9lectronique. Cependant, les autres solutions possibles susmentionn\u00e9es peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es au cours de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 18 octobre 2013",

Premakumar Kanagasabapathy (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte, T1774\/0412 (la plainte no 1), contre Air Canada (l\u2019 intim\u00e9e) sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), c H-6 (la Loi). Au titre des articles 7 et 14.1 de la Loi, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, dans le contexte de son emploi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui avait refus\u00e9 des occasions de promotion et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une forme de \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb parce que le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en 2000 et qu\u2019il avait auparavant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e en 2002. Il soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 pour des motifs fond\u00e9s sur la race, la couleur et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique. Dans la plainte no 1, le plaignant d\u00e9crit des \u00e9v\u00e8nements survenus entre d\u00e9cembre 2006 et le 19 mai 2008. Le 11 janvier 2012, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte. La port\u00e9e exacte de la plainte no 1 a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal (voir 2013 TCDP 7).\n[2] Le 9 mai 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission, T1945\/2513 (plainte no 2), contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sous le r\u00e9gime des articles 7 et 14.1 de la Loi. Dans la plainte no 2, le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dans le m\u00eame esprit que dans la plainte no 1; il y est cette fois question d\u2019\u00e9v\u00e8nements qui seraient survenus entre 2010 et avril 2012. Dans sa seconde plainte, en plus des motifs invoqu\u00e9s dans la plainte no 1, le plaignant affirme \u00e9galement qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination pour des motifs fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge.\n[3] Le 2 mai 2013, une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance (la CTGI) a eu lieu, au cours de laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de mettre la plainte no 1 en suspens, en attendant que la Commission renvoie la plainte no 2 devant le Tribunal. Vu que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de la plainte no 2 et que le plaignant ne participait pas \u00e0 la CTGI, seul son avocat y participait et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de l\u2019existence d\u2019une seconde plainte, et vu que la Commission ne pouvait pas se prononcer au sujet de la seconde plainte, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pour instruire la seconde plainte. En outre, il n\u2019y avait aucun moyen de savoir quand, ou m\u00eame si, la seconde plainte serait renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 de mettre en suspens la plainte no 1 comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019avait demand\u00e9. Lors de la CTGI, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties de d\u00e9poser leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et \u00e9tabli un calendrier \u00e0 cette fin, lequel se terminait le 20 juin 2013.\n[4] Le 17 juin 2013, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte no 2 devant le Tribunal.\n[5] \u00c0 la suite de ce renvoi, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 des dates en vue de la tenue d\u2019une CTGI avec les parties. Les parties ont confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elles seraient disponibles le 3 octobre 2013.\n[6] Le 3 octobre 2013, la CTGI a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e \u00e0 la demande de la Commission, et ce, en raison de circonstances impr\u00e9vues.\n[7] Dans des lettres dat\u00e9es du 17 octobre 2013 et du 4 novembre 2013, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 aux parties si elles seraient dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 ce que les plaintes nos 1 et 2 soient jointes de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00eatre entendues au cours d\u2019une seule audience. En r\u00e9ponse aux lettres du Tribunal dat\u00e9es du 17 octobre 2013 et du 4 novembre 2013, toutes les parties ont convenu de joindre les plaintes.\nLe droit applicable et l\u2019analyse\n[8] En vertu du paragraphe 40(4) de la Loi, c\u2019est la Commission qui a le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir si les plaintes devraient \u00eatre entendues ensemble et faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction commune par le Tribunal. Toutefois, la d\u00e9cision de tenir une audience ou plusieurs rel\u00e8ve de la proc\u00e9dure (voir la d\u00e9cision Lattey c. Compagnie de Chemin de fer canadien Pacifique, 2002 CanLII 45928 (TCDP), au paragraphe 11 (la d\u00e9cision Lattey)). En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique. En outre, le paragraphe 48.9(1) pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Ensemble, ces deux dispositions montrent que, aussi longtemps que ses r\u00e8gles de pratique sont justes, il appartient au Tribunal de d\u00e9finir la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir s\u2019il convient de tenir une audience ou plusieurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des deux plaintes en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[9] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lattey, pour \u00e9tablir si les plaintes en cause devaient \u00eatre entendues ensemble, le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il devait tenir compte d\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments, \u00e0 savoir :\n1. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu'il y a \u00e0 \u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures, y compris la r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts, des d\u00e9lais, des inconv\u00e9nients pour les t\u00e9moins, du besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la preuve et du risque de parvenir \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires;\n2. Le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait causer aux intim\u00e9s une instruction commune, notamment en raison du prolongement de la dur\u00e9e de l'audience pour chaque intim\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'examiner des questions propres \u00e0 l'autre intim\u00e9, ainsi que du risque de confusion que pourrait engendrer la pr\u00e9sentation d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n'ayant peut-\u00eatre pas rapport aux all\u00e9gations mettant en cause particuli\u00e8rement l'un ou l'autre intim\u00e9;\n3. L'existence de questions de fait ou de droit communes.\n(voir la d\u00e9cision Lattey, au paragraphe 12)\n[10] Vu les circonstances entourant les deux plaints en cause, je conclus que le fait de les entendre ensemble aurait pour effet d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer leur instruction et serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. Les deux plaintes font \u00e9tat d\u2019all\u00e9gations de discrimination similaires, et la plainte no 2 s\u2019inscrit essentiellement dans la continuit\u00e9 de la plainte no 1, y ajoutant d\u2019autres \u00e9v\u00e8nements qui se seraient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s. Le fait d\u2019entendre les deux plaintes ensemble permettrait au Tribunal de mettre ces plaintes en contexte, d\u2019un point de vue historique et factuel, et c\u2019est sur ce fondement que le Tribunal rendra sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque question de droit et de fait. Vu que les parties sont les m\u00eames pour les deux plaintes, contrairement \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Lattey, il n\u2019y aura aucune confusion relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ayant de rapport qu\u2019avec une des deux plaintes, comme il est d\u00e9crit dans le deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Lattey. En outre, les deux plaintes se trouvent \u00e0 des stades d\u2019instruction similaires, les parties conviennent de joindre les dossiers, et tout retard d\u00e9coulant de la jonction des audiences pourra \u00eatre r\u00e9duit par une gestion active de l\u2019instance.\n[11] Je trouve aussi la d\u00e9cision Entrop v. Imperial Oil Limited (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186, instructive; on peut y lire qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab ne serait pas pratique, efficace et juste d\u2019exiger qu\u2019une personne ne soul\u00e8ve des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles que dans le cadre d\u2019une instance distincte \u00bb. Bien que la plainte no 2 ne soit pas une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es par suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte no 1, il y est fait \u00e9tat de la continuation de la discrimination dont le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime dans la plainte no 1. Par cons\u00e9quent, il serait pratique et efficace d\u2019entendre ces deux plaintes ensemble.\n[12] L\u2019exercice par le Tribunal de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est soumis aux r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et au r\u00e9gime de la Loi. Je suis d\u2019avis que la jonction des deux plaintes s\u2019accorde avec les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et va dans le sens des objectifs l\u00e9gislatifs de la Loi, notamment en ce qui concerne le caract\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditif de l\u2019instruction et le fait de donner \u00e0 toutes les parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de participer \u00e0 l\u2019instruction (voir les paragr. 48.9(1) et 50(1) de la Loi).\n[13] Pour l\u2019ensemble des motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je demande que les plaintes nos 1 et 2 soient jointes et entendues au cours d\u2019une seule audience.\nSign\u00e9 par\nSophie Marchildon\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe\n12 novembre 2013",

Les plaignants soutiennent qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7u et continuent \u00e0 recevoir des services de maintien de l\u2019ordre de qualit\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieure aux services qui sont fournis aux collectivit\u00e9s non autochtones du Canada. Selon les plaignants, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9) commet ainsi un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019origine ethnique, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi.\n[2] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate porte sur une requ\u00eate en divulgation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants relativement \u00e0 la plainte susmentionn\u00e9e.\nLE CONTEXTE\n[3] En application du paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles), chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant notamment les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence. Le 2 mars 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, une liste de documents (la premi\u00e8re liste de documents) et un dossier de divulgation (le premier CD de divulgation).\n[4] Les plaignants ont demand\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 divulgue des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pour le faire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une autre liste de documents (la deuxi\u00e8me liste de documents) et un dossier de divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire (le deuxi\u00e8me CD de divulgation).\n[5] Malgr\u00e9 les divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires, les plaignants affirment que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas fourni une liste exhaustive des documents n\u00e9cessaires et qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fourni des copies int\u00e9grales de plusieurs documents figurant sur ses listes de documents.\n[6] Apr\u00e8s une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance tenue le 8 ao\u00fbt 2012, les parties ont convenu de chercher \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la question des divulgations de mani\u00e8re informelle. Ces efforts ayant \u00e9chou\u00e9, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en cause le 1er octobre 2012 afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance obligeant l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 faire des divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[7] La pr\u00e9sentation des observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate a pris fin le 16 novembre 2012. La Commission n\u2019a pas pris position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la requ\u00eate.\n[8] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le Tribunal a rendu l\u2019ordonnance suivante au sujet de la requ\u00eate en cause :\n[traduction]\n1. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents demand\u00e9s par les plaignants dans le tableau A de leur dossier de requ\u00eate dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, ou confirmer que les documents demand\u00e9s n\u2019existent pas.\na. Pour ce qui est des documents demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5a) du tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate des plaignants dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents qui d\u00e9crivent le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es qui re\u00e7oivent les services de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la GRC). Cette obligation vaut pour les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la GRC; les niveaux de dotation et de financement pour chaque collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9loign\u00e9e ou isol\u00e9e n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nb. Pour ce qui est des documents demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) du tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate des plaignants dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents qui d\u00e9crivent le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es qui font appel \u00e0 des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui rel\u00e8vent de la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cette obligation vaut pour les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale relatifs \u00e0 la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations; les niveaux de dotation et de financement de chaque service de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nc. Pour ce qui est des documents demand\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 11 du tableau A du dossier de requ\u00eate des plaignants dat\u00e9 du 1er octobre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents d\u00e9crivant les normes adopt\u00e9es par la GRC en mati\u00e8re de niveaux de service, d\u2019installations, d\u2019\u00e9quipement, de salaires, d\u2019avantages sociaux et d\u2019indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9loignement, ainsi que toute norme en mati\u00e8re de maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es. Cette obligation vaut pour les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la GRC; les normes s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 des collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations ou d\u2019autres collectivit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es.\n2. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit divulguer tous les documents en sa possession qui ont trait, pour la p\u00e9riode allant de 2007 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, \u00e0 un fait, \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties, ou encore confirmer que les documents demand\u00e9s n\u2019existent pas.\n3. En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles), l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit transmettre aux autres parties une liste globale des documents qui sont en sa possession et pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9. Cette liste globale doit inclure tous les documents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et tous les documents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 qui seront divulgu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 1 et 2 de l\u2019ordonnance.\n4. En application du paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit fournir aux autres parties une copie de chaque document \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la liste globale d\u00e9crite au paragraphe 3 de l\u2019ordonnance. Chaque document fourni devra porter un titre ou une indication renvoyant clairement \u00e0 la liste globale de documents, afin que les plaignants puissent facilement identifier et consulter le document.\n5. Les documents fournis conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 4 de l\u2019ordonnance ne doivent pas \u00eatre caviard\u00e9s. Si certains documents ne peuvent pas \u00eatre fournis dans leur version int\u00e9grale, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra expliquer pourquoi.\n6. En application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) et du paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit transmettre aux autres parties une liste globale des documents qui sont en sa possession et pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit fournir une explication pour chaque privil\u00e8ge qui est invoqu\u00e9. Cette liste globale doit inclure tous les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et tous les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 qui seront divulgu\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 1 et 2 de l\u2019ordonnance.\n7. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit se conformer aux paragraphes 1 \u00e0 6 de l\u2019ordonnance au plus tard le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2013.\n[9] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate constitue les motifs de l\u2019ordonnance rendue par le Tribunal le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012.\nLA D\u00c9CISION SUR REQU\u00caTE\n[10] Conform\u00e9ment aux principes de justice naturelle et au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties \u00e0 une instance du Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur position. Cela exige la divulgation de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents aux yeux des parties. S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document demand\u00e9 et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement recherch\u00e9s par les parties, ce document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et e) des R\u00e8gles (voir les d\u00e9cisions Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 et Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, je rappelle l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles, \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 1(1), c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de permettre :\na) que toutes les parties \u00e0 une instruction aient la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre;\nb) que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace;\nc) que toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible.\n[11] Gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit ces principes, j\u2019exposerai ci\u2011apr\u00e8s les moyens invoqu\u00e9s par les plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur requ\u00eate et la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 ce sujet.\nLe premier CD de divulgation est incomplet et insuffisant\n[12] Les plaignants soutiennent que le premier CD de divulgation est incomplet et insuffisant parce que de nombreux documents qui figuraient sur la premi\u00e8re liste de documents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inclus sur le CD et que les documents grav\u00e9s sur le CD ne correspondent pas \u00e0 la num\u00e9rotation de la premi\u00e8re liste de documents. Selon les plaignants, le CD contient principalement des fichiers PDF de grande taille, sans table des mati\u00e8res et qui semblent chacun contenir un bon nombre de documents non class\u00e9s. Les plaignants affirment que l\u2019absence d\u2019organisation des documents du premier CD de divulgation rend leur examen difficile. Ils soutiennent que l\u2019obligation de fournir des documents que pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles inclut vraisemblablement l\u2019obligation de le faire sous une forme qui permet \u00e0 la partie qui re\u00e7oit les documents de trouver et d\u2019identifier les documents divulgu\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignants demandent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 leur fournisse un CD de divulgation ou un classeur qui soit organis\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re coh\u00e9rente et qui inclue tous les documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la premi\u00e8re liste de documents.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme avoir divulgu\u00e9 des documents aux plaignants le 2 mars et le 5 juillet 2012. Il soutient ne pas \u00eatre tenu de r\u00e9organiser les documents qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis aux plaignants.\n[14] Bien que les R\u00e8gles ne pr\u00e9cisent pas la mani\u00e8re ou la forme que doit prendre la divulgation, l\u2019objet des r\u00e8gles et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les principes d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exigent que la divulgation et la production de documents soient suffisantes pour que chaque partie ait la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de se faire entendre. La production d\u2019un CD dont le contenu n\u2019est pas structur\u00e9, qui n\u2019a pas de table des mati\u00e8res et qui renferme des documents non class\u00e9s nuit \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 des plaignants d\u2019invoquer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 estime pertinents en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ou de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ceux-ci. De plus, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la d\u00e9sorganisation du premier CD de divulgation a fait que l\u2019argumentation et la preuve n\u2019ont pas pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace. Les parties en sont encore \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape des divulgations, et ce, depuis mars 2012. Certes, le premier CD de divulgations d\u00e9sorganis\u00e9 n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas la seule cause de ce retard, mais il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur. D\u2019ailleurs, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 que certains documents exig\u00e9s au moyen de la requ\u00eate en cause ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis aux plaignants. Peut-\u00eatre que si les documents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 produits plus efficacement d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, la requ\u00eate en cause \u2013 ou au moins certains de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u2013 n\u2019aurait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire et l\u2019instance aurait peut-\u00eatre progress\u00e9 plus rapidement.\n[15] Par cons\u00e9quent, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, et compte tenu des divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires ordonn\u00e9es ci-dessous, j\u2019estime que la fa\u00e7on la plus simple de r\u00e9gler la question du premier CD de divulgation d\u00e9sorganis\u00e9 est d\u2019exiger que l\u2019intim\u00e9 produise une liste globale de documents en application des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et e) des R\u00e8gles. Cette liste globale devra inclure tous les documents divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour et tous les documents dont la divulgation est ordonn\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Chaque document fourni aux plaignants conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles devra porter un titre ou une indication renvoyant clairement \u00e0 la liste globale de documents afin que les plaignants puissent facilement identifier et consulter le document.\nLes documents divulgu\u00e9s sont caviard\u00e9s\n[16] Les plaignants affirment que de nombreux documents fournis dans les premier et deuxi\u00e8me CD de divulgation sont caviard\u00e9s et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fourni aucune justification pour le caviardage des documents. Les plaignants demandent donc au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire des versions int\u00e9grales des documents caviard\u00e9s.\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que certains des documents fournis aux plaignants sont caviard\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a accept\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les documents caviard\u00e9s afin de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il en existe des versions int\u00e9grales et, dans l\u2019affirmative, s\u2019ils peuvent \u00eatre fournis aux plaignants.\n[18] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait accept\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les documents pour v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il en existe des versions int\u00e9grales, les plaignants soulignent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas engag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir les versions int\u00e9grales des documents. Par cons\u00e9quent, si le Tribunal ne rendait pas d\u2019ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourrait simplement aviser les plaignants qu\u2019il ne fournira pas de documents int\u00e9graux, ce qui exigerait la pr\u00e9sentation de nouvelles observations et entra\u00eenerait d\u2019autres retards. Les plaignants affirment qu\u2019une ordonnance est donc n\u00e9cessaire.\n[19] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait accept\u00e9 d\u2019examiner les documents fournis pour v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il en existe des versions int\u00e9grales et, dans l\u2019affirmative, s\u2019il est possible de les fournir aux plaignants, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire de rendre une ordonnance \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal font une distinction entre les documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation (alin\u00e9a 6(1)e)) et ceux qui ne le sont pas (alin\u00e9a 6(1)d)). Seuls les documents pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre fournis aux autres parties (paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles). Cela d\u00e9coule du fait que les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments que le Tribunal ne peut pas admettre en preuve sont ceux qui, dans le droit de la preuve, sont confidentiels devant les tribunaux judiciaires (voir le paragraphe 50(4) de la Loi). Dans les autres cas, sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe 50(5) de la Loi, le Tribunal peut recevoir tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ou renseignement qu\u2019il juge indiqu\u00e9 (voir l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi). Bien que, dans certaines circonstances, le Tribunal puisse prendre des mesures pour prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 de renseignements divulgu\u00e9s \u2013 habituellement \u00e0 la demande d\u2019une des parties \u2013, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a demand\u00e9 aucune mesure de protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents qu\u2019il a fournis aux plaignants. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi certains des documents fournis sont caviard\u00e9s.\n[20] Le Tribunal ordonne donc \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir des versions int\u00e9grales de tous les documents fournis aux plaignants. Si certains documents ne peuvent pas \u00eatre fournis dans leur version int\u00e9grale, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra expliquer pourquoi.\nDemande de divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[21] Les plaignants avancent que les deux listes de documents fournies par l\u2019intim\u00e9 semblent ne pas comporter certains documents pertinents qui existent vraisemblablement. Selon les plaignants, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral n\u00e9gocie des accords sur les services de police relativement au maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les collectivit\u00e9s du Conseil Mushkegowuk, il \u00e9value les services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations, il a des responsabilit\u00e9s importantes en mati\u00e8re de surveillance et il administre la GRC. Les plaignants soutiennent que, par l\u2019exercice de ces r\u00f4les et de certains autres r\u00f4les, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un nombre consid\u00e9rable d\u2019autres documents pertinents. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les plaignants affirment que les documents suivants sont en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ne figuraient pas sur les listes de documents qu\u2019il a fournis :\n1. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, Rapport du maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les r\u00e9serves indiennes (janvier 1990);\nDon Clairmont, Efficacit\u00e9 et viabilit\u00e9 des services de police des Premi\u00e8res nations (2001);\nM\u00e9moire au cabinet, \u00ab Services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour les collectivit\u00e9s indiennes et inuites \u00bb;\nRapport de d\u00e9cision, \u00ab Services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations pour les collectivit\u00e9s indiennes et inuites \u00bb;\n5. les documents d\u00e9crivant le processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux de dotation et de financement pour les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es qui re\u00e7oivent les services de :\na. la GRC,\nb. un service de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u2013 par exemple le service de police de Nishnawbe-Aski \u2013 qui est assujetti \u00e0 la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral;\n6. les documents ayant trait \u00e0 la n\u00e9gociation des accords \u00ab tripartis \u00bb du service de police de Nishnawbe-Aski, par exemple :\na. les demandes de ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires et les r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 de telles demandes,\nb. les documents justifiant les budgets propos\u00e9s ou le refus d\u2019accorder des ressources suppl\u00e9mentaires,\nc. les documents internes du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral o\u00f9 les besoins en mati\u00e8re de services de police sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s;\nles \u00e9valuations, rapports, comptes rendus d\u2019inspection ou photographies se rapportant aux logements des agents de police dans les collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk;\nles documents relatifs \u00e0 la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations et au Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res nations, notamment la version la plus r\u00e9cente de la politique, les modalit\u00e9s du programme et les lignes directrices et directives relatives au programme;\nles documents produits lors de l\u2019examen approfondi du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res nations men\u00e9 par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, y compris les options strat\u00e9giques \u00e9labor\u00e9es par suite de l\u2019examen;\nles documents du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor portant sur la qualit\u00e9 des services de police fournis aux Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk ou aux Premi\u00e8res Nations en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral;\nles documents d\u00e9crivant les normes r\u00e9gissant la GRC, notamment en mati\u00e8re de :\na. niveaux de service,\nb. installations (c.-\u00e0-d. postes de police et logements),\nc. \u00e9quipement,\nd. salaires, avantages sociaux et \u00ab indemnit\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9loignement \u00bb,\ne. toute norme en mati\u00e8re de maintien de l\u2019ordre dans les collectivit\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es ou isol\u00e9es.\nDocuments vis\u00e9s aux points 1 et 2\n[22] Selon les plaignants, les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 1 et 2 comportent des \u00e9valuations du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, et ces documents sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019affirmation des plaignants selon laquelle le programme est d\u00e9ficient et entra\u00eene un traitement discriminatoire. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne remet pas en cause la pertinence de ces documents; en fait, il affirme qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis aux plaignants. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 1 et 2 pourraient \u00eatre pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019instance et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit les fournir aux plaignants dans sa liste globale de documents dont la production a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e ci-dessus.\nDocuments vis\u00e9s aux points 3, 4 et 10\n[23] Les plaignants soutiennent que les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 3 et 4 comportent des d\u00e9tails sur l\u2019objet, la structure, les crit\u00e8res, les politiques et les modalit\u00e9s du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res nations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L\u00e0 encore, les plaignants affirment que ces documents sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leur affirmation selon laquelle le programme est d\u00e9ficient et entra\u00eene un traitement discriminatoire. De m\u00eame, les plaignants disent que les documents d\u00e9crits au point 10 contiennent des \u00e9valuations de la qualit\u00e9 des services de police fournis aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations, ce qui, selon les plaignants, est pertinent pour comparer les services offerts aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations avec ceux qui sont offerts aux autres collectivit\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 3, 4 et 10 semblent \u00eatre des documents confidentiels du Cabinet et que, \u00e0 ce titre, ils seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par l\u2019article 39 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada. Les plaignants r\u00e9pliquent que l\u2019article 39 de la Loi de la preuve au Canada ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 ces documents, que le greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 n\u2019a pas attest\u00e9 par \u00e9crit qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de documents confidentiels du Cabinet, que les documents ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis \u00e0 un tiers lors de l\u2019examen du Programme des services de police des Premi\u00e8res nations et que les documents semblent avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s il y a plus de 20 ans, ce qui les soustrait \u00e0 la protection de la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents du Cabinet, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 39(4)a) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada.\n[24] Encore une fois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas la pertinence possible des documents vis\u00e9s aux points 3, 4 et 10. Je suis d\u2019accord avec les plaignants pour dire que ces documents ont un lien rationnel avec l\u2019instance et qu\u2019ils doivent donc \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Si les documentsvis\u00e9s aux points 3, 4 et 10 sont bel et bien des documents confidentiels du Cabinet, une attestation \u00e9crite de ce fait par un ministre ou par le greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 devra \u00eatre fournie au Tribunal conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 39(1) de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada.\nDocuments vis\u00e9s aux points 5a) et 5b)\n[25] Les plaignants affirment que les documentsvis\u00e9s aux points 5a) et 5b) sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si des niveaux de service diff\u00e9rents sont appliqu\u00e9s aux collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations et aux autres collectivit\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, lorsque les plaignants auront d\u00e9fini les collectivit\u00e9s qu\u2019ils jugent pertinentes \u00e0 des fins de comparaison, il pourra r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande portant sur les documentsvis\u00e9s aux points 5a) et 5b). Les plaignants r\u00e9pondent qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9fini plusieurs groupes de comparaison valides et que, contrairement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avance, ils ne sont pas oblig\u00e9s de s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 un nombre pr\u00e9cis de collectivit\u00e9s comparables. Les plaignants ajoutent qu\u2019en pratique, ces documents peuvent \u00eatre fournis sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9finir des collectivit\u00e9s de comparaison pr\u00e9cises.\n[26] Je ne vois pas en quoi il est n\u00e9cessaire que des collectivit\u00e9s de comparaison pr\u00e9cises soient d\u00e9finies pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse fournir les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 5a) et 5b). Je crois comprendre que les documents demand\u00e9s par les plaignants au point 5a) sont des documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la GRC. La demande des plaignants ne vise pas les niveaux de dotation et de financement pr\u00e9cis pour chaque collectivit\u00e9 \u00e9loign\u00e9e ou isol\u00e9e qui re\u00e7oit les services de la GRC. Je crois aussi comprendre que les documents demand\u00e9s par les plaignants au point 5b) sont les documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ayant trait \u00e0 la Politique sur la police des Premi\u00e8res Nations. L\u00e0 encore, la demande des plaignants ne vise pas les niveaux de dotation et de financement pr\u00e9cis pour chaque service de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ces deux demandes sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 suffisamment pr\u00e9cises et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les plaignants donnent plus de d\u00e9tails \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne met pas en doute la pertinence possible de ces documents, et je reconnais qu\u2019ils ont un lien rationnel avec l\u2019instance. Par cons\u00e9quent, les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 5a) et 5b) doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nDocuments vis\u00e9s aux points 6, 7, 8 et 9\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les documents vis\u00e9s aux points 6, 7, 8 et 9 ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis aux plaignants et il dit que, si des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires sont trouv\u00e9s, ils seront aussi fournis. Les plaignants r\u00e9torquent en demandant au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir tout document suppl\u00e9mentaire ou de confirmer qu\u2019aucun document suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019existe.\n[28] Les parties conviennent que ces documents pourraient \u00eatre pertinents. J\u2019accepte donc les motifs avanc\u00e9s par les plaignants au tableau A de leur dossier de requ\u00eate pour expliquer leur demande. Par cons\u00e9quent, s\u2019il existe des documents appartenant aux cat\u00e9gories d\u00e9crites aux points 6, 7, 8 et 9, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit les fournir aux plaignants et, dans le cas contraire, l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit confirmer qu\u2019aucun document suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019existe.\nDocuments vis\u00e9s au point 11\n[29] Finalement, au point 11, les plaignants demandent les documents d\u00e9crivant les normes r\u00e9gissant la GRC afin de pouvoir les comparer aux normes qui s\u2019appliquent aux services de police des Premi\u00e8res Nations. L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que cette demande a une port\u00e9e excessive et que les plaignants doivent fournir plus de d\u00e9tails au sujet des collectivit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises qu\u2019ils consid\u00e8rent comme comparables aux fins de l\u2019analyse portant sur la discrimination. Les plaignants r\u00e9pliquent qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de choisir des collectivit\u00e9s de comparaison pr\u00e9cises pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse fournir les normes de la GRC demand\u00e9es.\n[30] L\u00e0 encore, je ne vois pas en quoi il est n\u00e9cessaire que des collectivit\u00e9s de comparaison pr\u00e9cises soient d\u00e9finies pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 puisse fournir les documents vis\u00e9s au point 11. Je crois comprendre que les documents demand\u00e9s par les plaignants sont des documents de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la GRC. La demande ne vise pas les normes qui s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 des collectivit\u00e9s pr\u00e9cises, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de collectivit\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations ou non. Cette demande n\u2019a pas une port\u00e9e excessive, car les plaignants ont d\u00e9crit les sources et les types de documents demand\u00e9s. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les plaignants pr\u00e9cisent davantage leur demande. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne met pas en doute la pertinence possible de ces documents, et je reconnais qu\u2019ils ont un lien rationnel avec l\u2019instance. Les documents vis\u00e9s au point 11 doivent donc \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\nD. Documents post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2007\n[31] Selon les plaignants, la deuxi\u00e8me liste de divulgation ne comporte aucun document datant de la p\u00e9riode allant de 2007 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui. Les plaignants veulent obtenir les documents produits pendant cette p\u00e9riode ou une explication de l\u2019absence de documents datant de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[32] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 des documents post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2007, mais qu\u2019aucun document ne lui a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni. L\u2019intim\u00e9 dit qu\u2019il fera un suivi quant \u00e0 sa demande visant \u00e0 obtenir des documents post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2007 et qu\u2019il fournira les documents pertinents ou expliquera pourquoi aucun document semblable n\u2019existe.\n[33] Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la demande des plaignants au sujet des documents post\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 2007 et puisque j\u2019ai conclu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 doit faire des divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires relativement aux documents d\u00e9crits ci-dessus, je pr\u00e9cise que tout document post\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2007 doit \u00eatre inclus dans toute divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire.\nD\u00e9lai pour faire les divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires\n[34] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en cause, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a dit qu\u2019il fournirait tout document suppl\u00e9mentaire, y compris des versions int\u00e9grales de documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournis, au plus tard le 14 janvier 2013.\n[35] Les plaignants sont pr\u00e9occup\u00e9s par le retard que causerait la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir tout document suppl\u00e9mentaire d\u2019ici le 14 janvier 2013. Il y aurait alors plus d\u2019un an que le d\u00e9lai initial qui \u00e9tait imparti \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour divulguer les documents aurait expir\u00e9. Toutefois, les plaignants sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 accepter la date propos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, \u00e0 condition que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance au sujet des documents qui, \u00e0 son avis, doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s et que les parties puissent ainsi clore l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation.\n[36] Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 la date du 14 janvier 2013 malgr\u00e9 son opposition \u00e0 plusieurs volets de la requ\u00eate des plaignants qui est en cause et puisque le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires et d\u2019autres mesures corr\u00e9latives, j\u2019accorde jusqu\u2019au 15 f\u00e9vrier 2013 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour se conformer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nSign\u00e9 par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 16 janvier 2013\nTRIBUNAL CANADIEN DES DROITS DE LA PERSONNE\nPARTIES INSCRITES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIERS DU TRIBUNAL :\nTT1683\/3811 et T1684\/3911\nINTITUL\u00c9 :\nGrand chef Stan Loutitt en sa qualit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentant des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Conseil Mushkegowuk et Grand chef Stan Loutitt en sa qualit\u00e9 personnelle c.

Les plaintes [1] Les plaignants soutiennent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, le sexe ou la situation de famille, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP).\n[2] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, les plaignants contestent l\u2019application par l\u2019intim\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c.1) de la Loi sur les Indiens lorsqu\u2019il a rejet\u00e9 leurs demandes d\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens. Selon cette disposition l\u00e9gale, les plaignants n\u2019ont pas eu droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription \u00e0 titre d\u2019Indiens parce qu\u2019ils sont n\u00e9s avant le 4 septembre 1951.\nII. La demande d\u2019ajournement des proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal [3] En avril 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019instruction des plaintes en attendant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne [le Tribunal] dans les affaires Matson et al. c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (T1444\/7009) [Matson] et Roger William Andrews et Roger William Andrews au nom de Michelle Dominique Andrews c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (T1686\/4111, T1725\/8011) [Andrews], qui portaient sur des plaintes semblables visant l\u2019application par l\u2019intim\u00e9 des dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens. Les plaignants se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement des proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal. La Commission a propos\u00e9 que les parties \u00e9changent leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et proc\u00e8dent \u00e0 la divulgation de la fa\u00e7on habituelle, puis discutent de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un ajournement par la suite.\n[4] Avant qu\u2019il ait eu l\u2019occasion de trancher en fonction des observations des parties, le 24 mai 2013, le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Matson, 2013 TCDP 13. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la plainte, concluant que les plaignants contestaient les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni par l\u2019intim\u00e9.

Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 CAF 7, le Tribunal a conclu que les contestations qui visent uniquement une loi ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la port\u00e9e de la LCDP.\n[5] Le 8 ao\u00fbt 2013, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab [...] des observations des parties sur la fa\u00e7on dont elles souhaitent proc\u00e9der pour les plaintes \u00e0 partir de maintenant \u00bb, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Matson.\n[6] Les plaignants se sont une fois de plus oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019instruction de leurs plaintes.\n[7] La Commission a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Matson. La Commission \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Matson \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal devrait continuer de traiter les questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce selon la proc\u00e9dure habituelle.\n[8] Compte tenu de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e pour la d\u00e9cision Matson, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 deux fa\u00e7ons d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant : disjoindre les plaintes en deux phases \u2014 a) la comp\u00e9tence et b) le fondement \u2014 et proc\u00e9der en utilisant les pr\u00e9cisions qui ne sont pertinentes qu\u2019\u00e0 la premi\u00e8re phase, ou ajourner l\u2019affaire en attendant la d\u00e9cision au sujet de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Commission.\n[9] Dans sa r\u00e9plique, la Commission a reconnu que les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce devraient \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9es en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue au sujet de sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Matson. Elle a aussi propos\u00e9 des modalit\u00e9s pour tenir le Tribunal au fait de l\u2019\u00e9tat de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et pour r\u00e9\u00e9valuer l\u2019ajournement.\n[10] Le 30 septembre 2013, le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Andrews, 2013 TCDP 31. Comme dans Matson, les deux plaintes dans Andrews ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es parce que le Tribunal a conclu que le plaignant contestait les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[11] Le m\u00eame jour, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour voir si elles avaient des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont elles voulaient proc\u00e9der, compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Andrews.\n[12] Les plaignants n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation suppl\u00e9mentaire et tant la Commission que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019ils souhaitaient l\u2019ajournement des plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue au sujet de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Matson par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a not\u00e9 que la Commission avait aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Andrews et a propos\u00e9 que cette demande soit r\u00e9unie \u00e0 celle de la d\u00e9cision Matson.\nIII. Les dispositions applicables et analyse [13] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019ajourner une affaire. Dans Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[15] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres de leur proc\u00e9dure. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils disposent d\u2019importants pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de se prononcer sur des demandes d\u2019ajournement. Ce principe est analys\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad c. Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration, [1989] 1. R.C.S. 560. Dans cette affaire, l\u2019appelant avait demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de son enqu\u00eate d\u2019immigration en attendant que le Ministre rende sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa demande visant \u00e0 lui permettre de demeurer au Canada. L\u2019arbitre a rejet\u00e9 la demande d\u2019ajournement.\n[16] Dans son jugement, la Cour supr\u00eame a affirm\u00e9 que les tribunaux administratifs, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, sont ma\u00eetres chez eux et fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure. Cependant, dans l\u2019exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, ces tribunaux sont tenus de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. [Voir aussi Re Cedarvale Tree Services Ltd. and Labourers\u2019 International Union of North America, (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 40, 50 (C.A. Ont.), Pierre c. Ministre de la Main-d\u2019\u0153uvre et de l\u2019Immigration, [1978] 2 C.F. 849, 851 (C.F., 1re inst.)].\n[14] Cela dit, l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal est assujetti aux r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de la justice naturelle, de m\u00eame qu\u2019au r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. La LCDP exige que le Tribunal instruise les plaintes qui lui sont renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission et qu\u2019il donne aux parties l\u2019occasion pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur cause et des observations (voir les paragraphes 49(2) et 50(1) de la LCDP). L\u2019article 2 de la LCDP fait aussi \u00e9tat d\u2019un int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019\u00e9limination des pratiques discriminatoires. Il importe aussi de souligner que le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle.\n[15] Dans une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente, qui \u00e0 mon avis s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, Marshall c. Cerescorp Company, 2011 TCDP 5, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit :\n[11] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, l\u2019instruction des plaintes par le Tribunal doit se faire sans formalisme et, \u00e9l\u00e9ment particuli\u00e8rement pertinent quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Cependant, comme le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de ses propres proc\u00e9dures, il peut n\u00e9anmoins ajourner une instance lorsqu\u2019il juge appropri\u00e9 d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire (voir L\u00e9ger c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada [1999] D.C.D.P. no 6 (TCDP), au paragraphe 4; Baltruweit c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2004 TCDP 14, au paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal doit exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en respectant les principes de justice naturelle (Baltruweit, au paragraphe 17). Le Tribunal peut devoir tenir compte de questions de justice naturelle telles que la non-accessibilit\u00e9 de la preuve, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner pour trouver un avocat ou la communication tardive de la partie adverse. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[16] Les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ressemblent \u00e0 celles dont il \u00e9tait question dans les affaires Matson et Andrews, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis un acte discriminatoire lorsqu\u2019il a appliqu\u00e9 les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens. Si le raisonnement du Tribunal dans les d\u00e9cisions Matson et Andrews \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9 aux plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le r\u00e9sultat serait probablement le m\u00eame : les plaintes seraient rejet\u00e9es. Comme les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants dans Matson et dans Andrews soutenaient aussi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait commis un acte discriminatoire en appliquant les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 ces plaintes parce qu\u2019il a conclu qu\u2019elles visaient les dispositions en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription de la Loi sur les Indiens, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait offert. Le Tribunal a conclu que les contestations visant uniquement une loi ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la port\u00e9e de la LCDP.\n[17] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission soutient que la LCDP permet l\u2019instruction de plaintes qui contestent directement l\u2019application qu\u2019un minist\u00e8re fait d\u2019une loi. L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que ce type de plainte ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la LCDP. Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 son avis sur la question dans les affaires Matson et Andrews. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est maintenant saisie de la question en contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu du fait que la m\u00eame question se trouve actuellement devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019instruction des plaintes en ce moment ne fournirait pas de r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te aux questions qui y sont soulev\u00e9es. \u00c0 mon avis, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, les parties et le Tribunal b\u00e9n\u00e9ficieraient d\u2019une clarification de ces questions par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[18] Le raisonnement du Tribunal dans Bailie et al. c. Air Canada et Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2012 TCDP 6 [Baillie], qui devait trancher une requ\u00eate en ajournement semblable en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, est instructif :\n[22] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la \u00ab directive \u00bb de proc\u00e9der de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible doit \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans un contexte plus vaste. Dans les affaires telles que celles concernant la propagande haineuse vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 (c.\u2011\u00e0\u2011d., Abrams et Makow) et les affaires concernant les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (Vilven\/Kelly, Thwaites et al. et Bailie et al.), un ajournement de courte dur\u00e9e permettrait peut-\u00eatre d\u2019obtenir un gain \u00e0 long terme, ainsi qu\u2019un meilleur r\u00e9sultat final. Autrement dit, il est plus \u00e9quitable et plus juste et \u00ab exp\u00e9ditif \u00bb \u00e0 long terme pour les parties en cause et les parties futures de laisser une affaire qui comporte des questions litigieuses identiques ou essentiellement semblables suivre son cours au sein du syst\u00e8me judiciaire ou du syst\u00e8me de justice administrative que de tenir dans chaque cas une audience, suivie de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire et d\u2019appels. Cette option est \u00e9galement plus juste sur le plan de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, compte tenu des ressources restreintes dont disposent le Tribunal et les Cours et que financent les contribuables. Je suis bien d\u2019accord avec l\u2019observation de la Commission selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [c]e n\u2019est donc que dans les circonstances les plus exceptionnelles qu\u2019il y a lieu de suspendre l\u2019instruction des plaintes \u00bb. C\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce : nous avons affaire ici \u00e0 des \u00ab circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb.\n[19] Dans Baillie, le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 :\n[27] J\u2019ai suivi le raisonnement et la d\u00e9marche que le membre instructeur Lustig a suivis dans les affaires Abrams et Makow, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, relativement aux affaires de propagande haineuse li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 dont le Tribunal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, lesquels raisonnement et d\u00e9marche sont expos\u00e9s aux paragraphes 9 et 8 de ces deux affaires, respectivement. Je signale que dans les affaires de propagande haineuse, il y avait aussi des d\u00e9cisions contradictoires du Tribunal \u00e0 propos de la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13 : voir la d\u00e9cision Lemire, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et Schnell c. Machiavelli and Associates Emprize Inc., 2002 CanLII 1887. Cependant, contrairement \u00e0 Bailie et al., dans le cas des affaires li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 il existait au moins un arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada datant de 1990 : Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, 1990 3 R.C.S. 892, qui portait sur la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 13. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le Tribunal, dans les d\u00e9cisions Makow et Abrams, a conclu que les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice faisaient manifestement pencher la balance en faveur d\u2019un ajournement (en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019existence d\u2019un arr\u00eat hautement instructif de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada), il s\u2019ensuit que l\u2019argument en faveur de l\u2019ajournement de la pr\u00e9sente affaire a encore plus de poids, vu l\u2019absence d\u2019une directive judiciaire semblable.\n[20] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la \u00ab directive \u00bb de proc\u00e9der de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible doit aussi \u00eatre prise dans un contexte plus large. Le fait de retarder la proc\u00e9dure maintenant, en attendant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, pourra \u00e9viter le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire plus tard, et la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale servira de guide pour le Tribunal sur la fa\u00e7on de traiter les plaintes. Comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans Baillie, l\u2019argument \u00e0 l\u2019appui de l\u2019ajournement des proc\u00e9dures est aussi soutenu par l\u2019absence d\u2019une directive judiciaire sur les questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[21] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 suivi cette approche pour un autre ensemble de plaintes dans lequel des all\u00e9gations semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es au sujet de l\u2019application que le minist\u00e8re des Anciens combattants a faite de la Loi sur les mesures de r\u00e9insertion et d\u2019indemnisation des militaires et v\u00e9t\u00e9rans des Forces canadiennes (Dossiers du Tribunal T1898\/12812 \u00e0 T1901\/13112). Sur consentement des parties, ces plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9es en attendant qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue dans la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Matson.\n[22] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants ne consentent pas \u00e0 l\u2019ajournement. Compte tenu du temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis le moment o\u00f9 ils ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs plaintes et compte tenu de leur \u00e2ge, je comprends que les plaignants souhaitent qu\u2019on proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de leurs plaintes et qu\u2019on \u00e9vite des retards additionnels. Cependant, compte tenu du r\u00e9sultat possible de ces plaintes si je tranche sans attendre les pr\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, je ne suis pas convaincue que le fait de proc\u00e9der imm\u00e9diatement permettra d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019autres d\u00e9lais. En fait, je crois que cela pourrait cr\u00e9er plus de d\u00e9lais \u00e0 long terme.\n[23] Je reconnais que chaque affaire poss\u00e8de ses propres particularit\u00e9s, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019individus uniques et que chaque affaire est fond\u00e9e sur des faits et des questions diff\u00e9rentes. Je reconnais aussi le r\u00f4le important que les a\u00een\u00e9s jouent dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et l\u2019importance de leur droit d\u2019\u00eatre entendus lorsqu\u2019ils exercent ce r\u00f4le. J\u2019ai aussi examin\u00e9 attentivement les r\u00e9percussions que subiront les plaignants si l\u2019affaire est ajourn\u00e9e. Cependant, je suis d\u2019avis que les d\u00e9lais suppl\u00e9mentaires possibles et les complexit\u00e9s qui seraient cr\u00e9\u00e9s si le Tribunal proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de ces plaintes sans attendre les pr\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019emportent sur ces facteurs.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a propos\u00e9 un terrain d\u2019entente, o\u00f9 l\u2019instruction des plaintes serait ajourn\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rende une d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Matson, et possiblement dans l\u2019affaire Andrews, si ces affaires sont r\u00e9unies, apr\u00e8s quoi le Tribunal pourrait r\u00e9examiner la question de l\u2019ajournement. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas d\u2019avis que l\u2019ajournement s\u2019applique \u00e0 tous les appels (Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et Cour supr\u00eame), si c\u2019est l\u00e0 la voie que prendront les affaires Matson et Andrews.\n[25] Compte tenu des divers int\u00e9r\u00eats et besoins des parties et du Tribunal, j\u2019accueille la requ\u00eate en ajournement de la proc\u00e9dure en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nIV. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [26] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, les dossiers T1894\/12412, T1895\/12512 et T1896\/12612 du Tribunal sont ajourn\u00e9s sine die, selon les conditions suivantes :\n(1) La Commission tiendra le Tribunal inform\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou des appels des affaires Matson et Andrews, y compris de tout motif de jugement;\n(2) La question d\u2019un autre ajournement ou d\u2019une mise en suspens peut \u00eatre revue et tranch\u00e9e apr\u00e8s que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aura rendu une d\u00e9cision dans le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l\u2019affaire Matson et possiblement Andrews.\n(3) Toute partie ou le Tribunal peut demander la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion d\u2019instance apr\u00e8s la publication de motifs de jugement dans l\u2019un quelconque des contr\u00f4les judiciaires ou appels mentionn\u00e9s au paragraphe (1), de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9valuer l\u2019ajournement ou la mise en suspens accord\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 13 novembre 2013",

La Requ\u00eate [1] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2013, la plaignante requiert du Tribunal des ordonnances dans le dossier en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, lesquelles ordonnances sont contenues dans les conclusions du courriel envoy\u00e9 par la plaignante, et qui se lisent comme suit :\n[traduction]\nDemande d\u2019Ordonnances\nPar la pr\u00e9sente, je demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que :\n1. La Commission me fournisse une copie reli\u00e9e de sa divulgation, laquelle devra \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e sous forme de puces et \u00eatre imprim\u00e9e sur le recto seulement, et ce, dans la semaine suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal rendra sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, et que la Commission pr\u00e9cise comment elle compte me remettre la divulgation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 mes besoins sp\u00e9ciaux en mati\u00e8re de signification de documents, qu\u2019elle conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien.\n2. Mme Zagorska remette imm\u00e9diatement le livre de pi\u00e8ces qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab emprunt\u00e9 \u00bb pour la soir\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle a syst\u00e9matiquement refus\u00e9 de remettre, ce qui, selon moi, constitue un outrage au Tribunal, vu que le membre a ordonn\u00e9, le 6 mai 2013, que le livre soit remis \u00e0 la plaignante et a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il me serait remis d\u2019ici le 8 mai 2013.\net rende une ordonnance en ce sens avant le 31 ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[2] Subs\u00e9quemment \u00e0 cette premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate de la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re a amend\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re requ\u00eate en date du 21 aout 2013, afin de requ\u00e9rir les ordonnances suivantes :\n[traduction]\nOrdonnances Demand\u00e9es :\n1. Que Mme Warsame\/Commission divulgue imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 la Commission, par voie de signification, tous les renseignements relatifs aux dossiers T1701\/5611 et T1702\/5711, et qu\u2019elle divulgue les renseignements concernant la demande de la plaignante, qui veut que le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l\u2019avocat de RHDCC et RHDCC prennent part \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente plainte dont le Commission est actuellement saisie, mais qu\u2019ils soient des parties distinctes, de la mani\u00e8re qui est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e, pour la signification des documents \u00e0 la plaignante.\n2. Que le SATJ et TPSGC remettent imm\u00e9diatement le livre de pi\u00e8ces (d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui r\u00e9pond aux besoins sp\u00e9ciaux de la plaignante du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience) signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante le 6 mai 2013 et d\u00e9crivent clairement les changements apport\u00e9s dans le livre de pi\u00e8ces (y compris les pages qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9es du livre, ainsi que celles qui figurent maintenant dans le livre mais qui n\u2019en faisaient pas partie le 6 mai 2013) apr\u00e8s la signification \u00e0 la plaignante du livre de pi\u00e8ces le 6 mai 2013.\n[3] De fa\u00e7on pr\u00e9cise, les ordonnances recherch\u00e9es par la plaignante sont de nature strictement proc\u00e9durale et affectent le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instance qui a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9but\u00e9 dans le dossier de la plaignante en date du 6 et 7 mai 2013.\n[4] La plaignante soutient dans son argumentation que les ordonnances sont requises afin d\u2019assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019instance actuellement en cours et soutient que ces ordonnances sont requises, compte tenu du fait que la Commission n\u2019a pas divulgu\u00e9 sa preuve de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins sp\u00e9ciaux de la plaignante, ou bien ne l\u2019a en fait pas du tout divulgu\u00e9e \u00bb.\nII. R\u00e9ponse des intim\u00e9es [5] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante, les intim\u00e9es TPSGC et SATJ indiquent au Tribunal que dans la premi\u00e8re conclusion recherch\u00e9e de la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante, celle derni\u00e8re fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une tierce partie non-partie au litige, soit le RHDCC et imm\u00e9diatement, les intim\u00e9es indiquent que cette portion de la conclusion des ordonnances de la plaignante ne peut \u00eatre re\u00e7ue \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019absence de juridiction du Tribunal.\n[6] \u00c9galement, dans leurs soumissions, les intim\u00e9es indiquent que les ordonnances requises par la plaignante ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 30 juillet 2013, d\u00e9cision qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante dans une lettre qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e en date du 30 juillet 2013 et qui adressait sp\u00e9cifiquement les questions soumises par la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante.\n[7] \u00c9galement, les intim\u00e9es mentionnent qu\u2019elles avaient au pr\u00e9alable inform\u00e9 le Tribunal ainsi que la plaignante de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une requ\u00eate pour rejet une fois que la requ\u00eate de la plaignante sera compl\u00e9t\u00e9e. Ce faisant, tout ordre du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019effet de forcer les intim\u00e9es \u00e0 produire leur livre de pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 la plaignante serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9, puisqu\u2019il est fort possible qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas \u00e0 produire leur preuve dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[8] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, les intim\u00e9es indiquent qu\u2019il y aurait abus de proc\u00e9dure de la part de la plaignante puisque les points en cause auraient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9s dans la lettre du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 30 juillet 2013 et en cons\u00e9quence, elles plaident la res judicata puisque les m\u00eames questions ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9es par le Tribunal.\n[9] Cons\u00e9quemment, elles demandent au Tribunal de rejeter la requ\u00eate pour amender de la plaignante.\nIII. Argumentation de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [10] Dans son argumentation pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour amender de la plaignante, argumentation dat\u00e9e du 26 ao\u00fbt 2013, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne mentionne que la Commission avait, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de leurs intim\u00e9es, produit une copie papier de sa preuve \u00e0 la plaignante. De m\u00eame, la Commission indique qu\u2019avant le 25 juillet 2013, soit pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019environ six mois, la plaignante n\u2019a jamais fait \u00e9tat de quelque probl\u00e8me que ce soit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la divulgation de sa preuve ni non plus avait-elle exig\u00e9 une copie papier de cette divulgation (voir paragraphe 6 de l\u2019argumentation de la Commission).\n[11] De plus, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence en date du 29 juillet 2013, dans une correspondance qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante, que la divulgation de sa preuve avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie aux intim\u00e9es, et en cons\u00e9quence, elle n\u2019entendait pas fournir une deuxi\u00e8me copie papier.\n[12] \u00c9galement, la Commission indique que chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la divulgation de sa preuve est num\u00e9rot\u00e9 avec un num\u00e9ro de production lequel peut \u00eatre facilement compar\u00e9 avec la copie \u00e9lectronique d\u00e9j\u00e0 fourni par la Commission \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[13] Au soutien de son argumentation, la Commission fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la lettre du Tribunal dat\u00e9e du 30 juillet 2013, laquelle est utile de citer au long pour les fins d\u2019une bonne compr\u00e9hension de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision :\n[traduction]\nLe Tribunal accuse r\u00e9ception de vos courriels dat\u00e9s du 25 juillet 2013, \u00e0 17 h 26 et \u00e0 17 h 37, dans lesquels vous demandez que le livre de pi\u00e8ces de l\u2019intim\u00e9e vous soit remis par l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nApr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les transcriptions de l\u2019audience, je suis en mesure de confirmer que le livre de pi\u00e8ces de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a l\u2019obligation de fournir des copies de son livre de pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00e0 l\u2019audience seulement lorsque celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et admis en preuve. Le Tribunal ne peut pas ordonner qu\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve sur lequel une des parties se fondera lors de l\u2019audience soit fourni aux autres parties \u00e0 l\u2019avance.\nVeuillez vous r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, qui pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n9(4) \u00c0 d\u00e9faut du consentement des parties, un document figurant dans un cahier de preuve documentaire ne peut devenir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et admis en preuve par le membre instructeur.\nAussi, suivant le courriel dat\u00e9 du 29 juillet 2013, \u00e0 15 h 34, dans lequel vous avez demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne de vous fournir une \u00ab copie du CD de divulgation imprim\u00e9e dans une taille lisible \u00bb, le Tribunal vous demande de pr\u00e9ciser \u00e0 la Commission le num\u00e9ro des documents pour lesquels vous voulez avoir une version agrandie. La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa divulgation \u00e0 toutes les parties le 29 janvier 2013, et aucune pr\u00e9occupation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e concernant la qualit\u00e9 des documents \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Au cours de l\u2019audience, la qualit\u00e9 de l\u2019impression du document 15H du livre de pi\u00e8ces de la plaignante a pos\u00e9 probl\u00e8me. Cependant, des copies lisibles de la page ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies, comme le confirme la ligne 15 de la page 320 des transcriptions.\n[14] Toujours dans son argumentation, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au fait que le Tribunal, dans sa lettre du 30 juillet 2013, a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante [traduction] \u00ab de dire \u00e0 la Commission pour quels documents en particulier elle (Mme Marsden) voulait avoir une version agrandie \u00bb.\n[15] La Commission indique que la plaignante a simplement ignor\u00e9 les directives du Tribunal et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate laquelle reprenait les m\u00eames \u00e9l\u00e9ments de divulgation qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans sa lettre du 30 juillet 2013.\n[16] \u00c9galement, la Commission nie de fa\u00e7on formelle le fait qu\u2019elle puisse avoir [traduction] \u00ab sciemment d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la plaignante en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience \u00bb.\n[17] En dernier ressort, la Commission indique qu\u2019il est toujours loisible \u00e0 la plaignante de se conformer \u00e0 la lettre du 30 juillet 2013 envoy\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e0 son endroit afin de lui indiquer tout document d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 par la Commission qui requerrait une copie plus lisible. Ainsi, la Commission produira une nouvelle copie sp\u00e9cifique du document en question.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [18] Le Tribunal a bien tenu compte des repr\u00e9sentations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, tant par la plaignante, les intim\u00e9es, ainsi que par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[19] Apr\u00e8s en avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 le bien-fond\u00e9, et tenant compte des conclusions de la requ\u00eate pour amender de la plaignante, le Tribunal maintient sa d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 30 juillet 2013 en ce qui a trait aux ordonnances recherch\u00e9es par la plaignante.\n[20] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re ordonnance recherch\u00e9e par la plaignante, le Tribunal fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du 30 juillet 2013 laquelle avait indiqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on claire la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre afin d\u2019obtenir toute clarification en ce qui a trait \u00e0 des documents qui n\u2019appara\u00eetraient pas conformes dans la divulgation de la preuve d\u00e9j\u00e0 effectu\u00e9e en faveur de la plaignante.\n[21] Or, le Tribunal constate que la plaignante ne s\u2019est nullement conform\u00e9e \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re exigence pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate pour amender et requ\u00e9rir ainsi une d\u00e9cision formelle du Tribunal.\n[22] Toutefois, il appert jusqu\u2019au moment de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019obtenir les documents soumis par les intim\u00e9es ainsi que par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne dans des exigences qui ont pu lui \u00eatre acceptables dans le pass\u00e9, mais en tenant compte de certaines indications pr\u00e9cises quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont les documents devaient lui \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s.\n[23] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que toutes les parties au dossier sont de bonne foi et qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u00eame de trouver les compromis n\u00e9cessaires afin de faire parvenir \u00e0 la plaignante toute la documentation ainsi que les proc\u00e9dures requises, et cela en tenant compte de ses incapacit\u00e9s.\n[24] Le Tribunal constate donc qu\u2019aucune ordonnance plus sp\u00e9cifique dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier ne servirait les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice tenant compte qu\u2019il est toujours possible que la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance devienne non avenue pour toutes sortes de raisons hors du contr\u00f4le du Tribunal et personnelles \u00e0 la plaignante et que de nouvelles directives pourraient \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9es par la plaignante aux intim\u00e9es ou \u00e0 la Commission dans le futur quant \u00e0 la signification des proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[25] Cons\u00e9quemment, le Tribunal requiert de la plaignante qu\u2019elle fasse parvenir de fa\u00e7on claire et non \u00e9quivoque toutes les instructions qu\u2019elle juge utiles et pertinentes pour les fins de lui faire signifier les proc\u00e9dures des autres parties au pr\u00e9sent dossier. Le Tribunal demeure convaincu que les autres parties au dossier sauront faire preuve de toutes les accommodations possibles afin de r\u00e9pondre aux exigences de la plaignante et cela, sans la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance formelle du Tribunal.\n[26] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la premi\u00e8re conclusion recherch\u00e9e dans la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante, le Tribunal fait siens les commentaires des intim\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le RHDCC n\u2019est pas une partie au pr\u00e9sent dossier et en cons\u00e9quence, le Tribunal est sans juridiction en ce qui a trait \u00e0 cette tierce partie.\n[27] Tenant compte des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, le Tribunal rejette donc la premi\u00e8re ordonnance requise par la plaignante.\n[28] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me ordonnance de la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante, laquelle requiert du Tribunal une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019effet de retourner le livre de pi\u00e8ces (des intim\u00e9es), lequel lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni lors de l\u2019audition du 6 mai 2013, le Tribunal note que ce livre de pi\u00e8ces n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit en preuve et cela, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, lequel indique ce qui suit : \u00ab \u00c0 d\u00e9faut du consentement des parties, un document figurant dans un cahier de preuve documentaire ne peut devenir un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve tant qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience et admis en preuve par le membre instructeur \u00bb.\n[29] M\u00eame si la plaignante a re\u00e7u de la part des intim\u00e9es, \u00e0 l\u2019audition, ledit livre des pi\u00e8ces des intim\u00e9es, et cela \u00e0 l\u2019incitation du Tribunal, pour des fins de courtoisie et de meilleure compr\u00e9hension de la preuve, le Tribunal note que nulle part dans la transcription des d\u00e9bats du 6 et du 7 mai 2013, ledit livre de pi\u00e8ces n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 formellement introduit en preuve par les intim\u00e9es. Tout au plus, le livre de la plaignante a d\u00fbment \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit en preuve, et cela en conformit\u00e9 avec le fait que la plaignante a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sent dossier avec sa preuve en introduisant son propre cahier de pi\u00e8ces.\n[30] Comme la preuve de la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait s\u00fbrement pas termin\u00e9e en date du 7 mai 2013 et que les intim\u00e9es n\u2019avaient pas encore d\u00e9but\u00e9 leur preuve, aucun livre de pi\u00e8ces n\u2019avait d\u00fbment et l\u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 introduit en preuve lors du d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition du pr\u00e9sent dossier le 6 et 7 mai 2013 par les intim\u00e9es.\n[31] Au surplus, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re que la lettre du 30 juillet 2013 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante, laquelle d\u00e9cidait des m\u00eames questions formul\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante, ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9es par le Tribunal et cela, en conformit\u00e9 avec les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dures et de pratique du Tribunal dont il est fait \u00e9tat dans la lettre du 30 juillet 2013.\n[32] Forcer les intim\u00e9es \u00e0 remettre leur propre livre de pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 la plaignante telle qu\u2019elle l\u2019exige dans sa requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e, serait du point de vue du Tribunal, un abus de la proc\u00e9dure qui serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019exigence du paragraphe 9(4) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure et de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[33] D\u2019autre part, le Tribunal constate que la plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 obtenu une copie papier de la divulgation de la preuve qu\u2019elle recherche \u00e0 obtenir de nouveau de la part des intim\u00e9es.\n[34] Le Tribunal constate que la plaignante a donc obtenu une copie \u00e9lectronique de m\u00eame qu\u2019une copie papier de ladite preuve et que si des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de cette preuve s\u2019av\u00e9raient illisibles, le Tribunal avait indiqu\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 30 juillet 2013 \u00e0 la plaignante qu\u2019elle pouvait alors faire conna\u00eetre aux autres parties les documents dont elle avait besoin d\u2019obtenir de nouvelles copies aux fins d\u2019une meilleure compr\u00e9hension desdits documents.\n[35] Or, le Tribunal note que la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9e \u00e0 cette exigence laquelle apparait comme \u00e9tant simple de compr\u00e9hension et plus pratique afin de pouvoir r\u00e9soudre les dilemmes \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante peut \u00eatre confront\u00e9e.\n[36] Finalement, le Tribunal prend acte de l\u2019offre de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne qui, dans son m\u00e9moire, au paragraphe 22 indique ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nRien dans les documents portant les num\u00e9ros CCDP 185\/1 et CCDP 222\/19 ne donne \u00e0 penser que la Commission s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9e \u00e0 fournir une copie imprim\u00e9e reli\u00e9e de sa divulgation. La Commission a satisfait \u00e0 son obligation de divulgation et a fourni sa divulgation sur un CD, comme elle a l\u2019habitude de le faire. Avant ses courriels du mois de juillet 2013, la plaignante n\u2019a jamais soulev\u00e9 de pr\u00e9occupation concernant la divulgation de la Commission ni demand\u00e9 une copie imprim\u00e9e de la divulgation. Cela \u00e9tant dit, si Mme Marsden a besoin d\u2019une autre copie d\u2019un document particulier faisant partie des documents divulgu\u00e9s par la Commission et donne \u00e0 la Commission une description du document, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment ordonn\u00e9, la Commission lui fournira une autre copie du document en question.\nV. Conclusion [37] Tenant compte des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal rejette donc la requ\u00eate amend\u00e9e de la plaignante du 21 ao\u00fbt 2013.\n[38] Le Tribunal prend acte de l\u2019offre de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne d\u00e9crite comme suit :\n[traduction]\nCela \u00e9tant dit, si Mme Marsden a besoin d\u2019une autre copie d\u2019un document particulier faisant partie des documents divulgu\u00e9s par la Commission et donne \u00e0 la Commission une description du document, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment ordonn\u00e9, la Commission lui fournira une autre copie du document en question.\nSign\u00e9e par\nRobert Malo\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 25 novembre 2013",

La plainte\n[1] En 2008, la plaignante affirme que deux jeunes membres de sa communaut\u00e9 atteints du syndrome de Down avaient besoin de mesures d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole situ\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9serve. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 une \u00e9cole provinciale situ\u00e9e hors r\u00e9serve. Selon la plaignante, bien que le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral ait fourni un certain soutien financier pour le transport par autobus et pour les frais de scolarit\u00e9 provinciaux ordinaires, il a refus\u00e9 de payer les 80 000 $ n\u00e9cessaires pour les besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e.\n[2] La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir un soutien financier pour les besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e de ses deux membres constitue un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la race et sur la d\u00e9ficience au titre de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi). \u00c0 plus grande \u00e9chelle, la plaignante affirme que les lacunes dans le Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral donnent lieu \u00e0 de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des parents et des enfants des Premi\u00e8res Nations. En d\u2019autres mots, les mesures de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient les enfants membres de Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent dans une r\u00e9serve ne sont pas de la m\u00eame qualit\u00e9 que celles dont b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient leurs homologues non membres de Premi\u00e8res Nations qui vivent hors r\u00e9serve.\nII. La requ\u00eate\n[3] La plaignante affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate aux demandes de divulgation de documents formul\u00e9es par elle-m\u00eame ainsi que par la Commission dans la pr\u00e9paration en vue de l\u2019audience dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[4] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, dans une lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013, la plaignante a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 une demande qu\u2019elle avait formul\u00e9e le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2012, par laquelle elle sollicitait la divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. La plaignante affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a mentionn\u00e9, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 janvier 2013, qu\u2019elle produirait ces documents; toutefois, il ne l\u2019a pas fait. La plaignante a produit, en se fondant sur son examen des pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9j\u00e0 produites par l\u2019intim\u00e9, un tableau dans lequel elle expose les documents qui, selon elle, n\u2019ont toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s.\n[5] La plaignante demandait aussi, dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013, la production de documents qui expliquent comment le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00e9tablit les budgets globaux annuels, autant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle de l\u2019Ontario, du Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations d\u2019Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (\u00ab AADNC \u00bb). La plaignante dresse une liste des documents qui, selon elle, existent probablement, mais qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s.\n[6] En dernier lieu, apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 en revue les pi\u00e8ces qui avaient jusque-l\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9, la plaignante demande de plus, dans la lettre du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013, des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires en ce qui a trait \u00e0 certains des pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9j\u00e0 produites, dont notamment : des versions lisibles de certains documents, les pages manquantes de certains documents, les explications des acronymes apparaissant dans certains documents, les versions non caviard\u00e9es de certains documents, la raison pour laquelle pourquoi certains documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s en double, des documents expliquant l\u2019origine ou le contexte de certains documents, les documents auxquels il fait allusion dans des documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 produits, mais qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s, et les d\u00e9tails concernant les param\u00e8tres de recherches employ\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour trouver les documents pertinents.\n[7] La Commission a elle aussi envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, lettre dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013, dans laquelle elle appuie la demande de la plaignante expos\u00e9e dans la lettre du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013 en vue d\u2019obtenir des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires. Dans sa lettre, la Commission demande aussi \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer d\u2019autres pi\u00e8ces. La lettre de la Commission contient une liste d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires dont elle demande la divulgation; cette liste a \u00e9t\u00e9 dress\u00e9e en fonction de l\u2019examen effectu\u00e9 par la Commission relativement aux pi\u00e8ces produites par l\u2019intim\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[8] La plaignante affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 sa lettre du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013, ni \u00e0 celle de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013. Elle a par cons\u00e9quent pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce en vue d\u2019enjoindre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une divulgation suppl\u00e9mentaire et plus approfondie.\n[9] Dans le cadre de sa requ\u00eate, la plaignante demande aussi \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de mentionner ce qui suit : (i) les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires demand\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre trouv\u00e9s et ceux qui ne peuvent l\u2019\u00eatre; (ii) les demandes formul\u00e9es dans la lettre de la plaignante dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013 et dans la lettre de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013 auxquelles se rapportent chacun des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, et (iii) une description des recherches effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour les pi\u00e8ces qui n\u2019ont pu \u00eatre trouv\u00e9es.\nIII. La r\u00e9ponse\n[10] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9 mentionne qu\u2019il s\u2019engage \u00e0 faire en sorte que le dossier de preuve soit exhaustif dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer les renseignements demand\u00e9s par la plaignante et par la Commission. Il pr\u00e9voit \u00eatre capable de divulguer la plupart des pi\u00e8ces demand\u00e9es d\u2019ici la mi\u2011janvier 2014.\n[11] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la documentation se rapportant au budget global annuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale du Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale pour les Premi\u00e8res Nations, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 cette demande, quoiqu\u2019il affirme que la production de ces pi\u00e8ces pourrait prendre un certain temps. Il estime que cette demande vise un nombre important de documents (documents \u00e9lectroniques, documents papier et courriels) et que ceux\u2011ci devront \u00eatre examin\u00e9s, ce qui n\u00e9cessitera consid\u00e9rablement de temps et de ressources. Il sugg\u00e8re que la date limite de production de ces documents soit fix\u00e9e au 30 avril 2014.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 ajoute que la plaignante et la Commission ont toutes les deux demand\u00e9 la production d\u2019observations et de d\u00e9cisions du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, ces documents sont des documents confidentiels du Cabinet et ils ne peuvent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s ou produits. Six de ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rep\u00e9r\u00e9s et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s au Bureau du Conseil priv\u00e9 en vue qu\u2019une attestation soit d\u00e9livr\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 39 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada.\n[13] Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer les documents vis\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, il est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nIV. La r\u00e9plique\n[14] La plaignante et la Commission affirment qu\u2019une ordonnance officielle est tout de m\u00eame requise dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et ce, malgr\u00e9 la volont\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire les documents demand\u00e9s dans la requ\u00eate.\n[15] La plaignante r\u00e9it\u00e8re que la vaste majorit\u00e9 des pi\u00e8ces vis\u00e9es par la requ\u00eate en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce avait \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019il se soit engag\u00e9, le 23 janvier 2013, \u00e0 produire ces pi\u00e8ces, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne les a pas encore produites. La plaignante est d\u2019avis que l\u2019engagement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces en question ne s\u2019est manifestement pas av\u00e9r\u00e9 suffisant.\n[16] La Commission soutient que, puisqu\u2019il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un certain nombre de demandes ainsi qu\u2019une s\u00e9rie de production de pi\u00e8ces au cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, la d\u00e9livrance de l\u2019ordonnance officielle aura l\u2019avantage de clarifier (i) ce qui doit \u00eatre produit exactement, et (ii) d\u2019ici quelle date.\n[17] La plaignante et la Commission font aussi remarquer que la requ\u00eate ne demande pas uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire les documents vis\u00e9s, mais aussi de pr\u00e9ciser la fa\u00e7on dont les pi\u00e8ces produites correspondent aux demandes formul\u00e9es. Elles sont d\u2019avis que les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019offrent aucune garantie que de telles explications seront produites. Selon la plaignante, ces renseignements sont n\u00e9cessaires pour que le Tribunal, la plaignante et la Commission : a) comprennent quels pi\u00e8ces l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne peut trouver, par opposition aux pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019elle refuse de produire (p. ex., pour des motifs li\u00e9s \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9); b) comprennent comment l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de production; c) v\u00e9rifient la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de production, et d) examinent la question de savoir si la recherche effectu\u00e9e pour trouver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quate.\n[18] En ce qui concerne la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire d\u2019ici le 30 avril 2014 la documentation se rapportant au budget global annuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale du Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale des Premi\u00e8res Nations, ni la plaignante ni la Commission ne croient que cette date limite est raisonnable. Elles sont d\u2019avis que les proc\u00e9dures ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 trop \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9es en raison des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la divulgation. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re demande de documents, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est au courant de son existence au moins depuis la r\u00e9ception des lettres du 1er et du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013. Donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 jusqu\u2019au 30 avril 2014 pour produire ces documents voudrait dire qu\u2019il aura eu presque neuf mois pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en 2009 et qu\u2019elle se rapporte \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de discrimination continue, la plaignante soutient que des retards suppl\u00e9mentaires pourraient entra\u00eener un pr\u00e9judice irr\u00e9parable pour certains enfants membres de Premi\u00e8res Nations et que ces retards risquent aussi de discr\u00e9diter l\u2019administration de la justice.\n[19] Selon la plaignante, donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pour se conformer \u00e0 la demande devrait suffire s\u2019il affecte assez de ressources \u00e0 la t\u00e2che. Cependant, compte tenu des calendriers de vacances et des autres engagements, la Commission affirme qu\u2019elle ne pourrait vraisemblablement pas commencer son examen des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avant la mi\u2011janvier ou la fin janvier. Par cons\u00e9quent, une directive portant que les documents demand\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s d\u2019ici le 31 janvier 2014 lui conviendrait.\nV. D\u00e9cision\n[20] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, l\u2019instruction des plaintes devant le Tribunal se fait de la fa\u00e7on la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible. De plus, au titre du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur position. Cela n\u00e9cessite que les parties divulguent les renseignements qui pourraient \u00eatre pertinents.\n[21] Depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en octobre et en novembre 2012, il y a de cela plus d\u2019un an, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de franchir l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Cela s\u2019explique par le fait que la plaignante et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires, renseignements qu\u2019elles affirment ne pas avoir encore re\u00e7us. L\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas la pertinence des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires et il a consenti \u00e0 les divulguer. Les parties ont tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler les questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la divulgation de mani\u00e8re informelle; toutefois, cela n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de faire avancer la pr\u00e9sente instance de mani\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditive. De plus, la plaignante et la Commission estiment qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur position si ces renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires ne sont pas divulgu\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, je crois qu\u2019une directive du Tribunal est n\u00e9cessaire pour garantir que la pr\u00e9sente instance progresse de mani\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditive et \u00e9quitable.\n[22] Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas la possible pertinence des documents demand\u00e9s dans la lettre de la plaignante dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013 et dans celle de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013, je lui enjoins de divulguer ces documents, conform\u00e9ment aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04). \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des observations des parties, je crois que le 17 janvier 2014 serait une date limite raisonnable pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 se conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente directive en ce qui concerne tous les documents, exception faite de ceux se rapportant au budget global annuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale pour le Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Ces documents devront \u00eatre produits d\u2019ici le 7 mars 2014.\n[23] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la directive du Tribunal concernant la divulgation des pi\u00e8ces suppl\u00e9mentaires, la plaignante et la Commission demandent aussi que l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise : (i) les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires demand\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre trouv\u00e9s et ceux qui ne peuvent l\u2019\u00eatre; (ii) les demandes formul\u00e9es dans la lettre de la plaignante dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013 et dans la lettre de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013 auxquelles se rapportent chacun des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, et (iii) une description des recherches effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les pi\u00e8ces qui n\u2019ont pu \u00eatre retrouv\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une demande raisonnable, compte tenu de la grande quantit\u00e9 de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires devant \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s. Cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der donnera de plus l\u2019assurance que la divulgation et la production de tout document suppl\u00e9mentaire suffiront pour permettre \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re d\u2019\u00eatre entendues.\n[24] Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 une strat\u00e9gie similaire dans l\u2019affaire Grand chef Stan Louttit et al. c. PGC, 2013 TCDP 27 (Louttit). Pour \u00e9viter la situation avec laquelle le Tribunal a d\u00fb composer dans cette d\u00e9cision ainsi que tout retard suppl\u00e9mentaire dans la pr\u00e9sente instance en raison des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la divulgation, j\u2019enjoins \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de produire une explication au sujet de la mani\u00e8re avec laquelle elle a r\u00e9pondu aux demandes de divulgation formul\u00e9es par la plaignante et par la Commission.\n[25] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal d\u00e9livre les directives suivantes :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 effectuera une recherche diligente pour trouver les documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la lettre de la plaignante dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013; elle produira une liste r\u00e9vis\u00e9e des documents, laquelle comprendra les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, et elle produira les documents en question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation n\u2019est revendiqu\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 effectuera une recherche diligente pour trouver les documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la lettre de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013; elle produira une liste r\u00e9vis\u00e9e des documents, laquelle comprendra les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, et elle produira les documents en question \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non\u2011divulgation n\u2019est revendiqu\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 mentionnera par \u00e9crit au Tribunal et \u00e0 toutes les parties, (i) les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires demand\u00e9s qui peuvent \u00eatre trouv\u00e9s et ceux qui ne peuvent l\u2019\u00eatre; (ii) les demandes formul\u00e9es dans la lettre de la plaignante dat\u00e9e du 1er ao\u00fbt 2013 et dans la lettre de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 9 ao\u00fbt 2013 auxquelles se rapportent chacun des documents suppl\u00e9mentaires (iii) une description des recherches effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui n\u2019ont pu \u00eatre trouv\u00e9s.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 se conformera, d\u2019ici le 17 janvier 2014, aux directives 1, 2 et 3 ci\u2011dessus pour tous les documents, exception faite de ceux se rapportant au budget global annuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale pour le Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale des Premi\u00e8res Nations.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 se conformera, d\u2019ici le 7 mars 2014, aux directives 1, 2 et 3 ci\u2011dessus pour les documents se rapportant au budget global annuel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale pour le Programme d\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9ciale des Premi\u00e8res nations.\nDans les quatre (4) semaines suivant la r\u00e9ception de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la directive 5 ci\u2011dessus, la plaignante et la Commission mentionneront par \u00e9crit au Tribunal et \u00e0 toutes les parties s\u2019il reste d\u2019autres points laiss\u00e9s en suspens en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la divulgation dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

D\u00e9cision 22\nI. Le contexte\n[1] Le 20 janvier 2010, M. Geevarughese Johnson Itty, aussi connu sous le nom de M. Johnson Itty (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la plainte) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) contre l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019ASFC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e), all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et l\u2019\u00e2ge, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, c. H-6, dans sa version modifi\u00e9e (la Loi).\n[2] Le 24 avril 2012, la Commission a envoy\u00e9 une lettre (la lettre de renvoi) \u00e0 laquelle elle a joint une copie de la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) pour lui demander d\u2019instruire la plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi.\n[3] La Commission a fait savoir qu\u2019\u00e0 moins que de nouvelles circonstances l\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 modifier sa position, elle ne prendrait pas part \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] Le 31 janvier 2013, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Outre les pr\u00e9cisions relatives aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination commises \u00e0 son endroit par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, le plaignant pr\u00e9tend qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9cise \u00e9galement qu\u2019il envisage de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en modification de sa plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure les all\u00e9gations de contravention \u00e0 l\u2019article 10.\n[5] Le 8 mars 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que le plaignant formule dans sa plainte des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019article 10. Toutefois, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e contient des r\u00e9ponses ainsi qu\u2019une d\u00e9fense \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations au titre de l'article 10.\n[6] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention de le faire.\n[7] Le 11 avril 2013, les parties, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par leurs avocats, et moi, en l\u2019absence de l\u2019avocat de la Commission,avons pris part \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, au cours de laquelle le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il pr\u00e9senterait une requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure les all\u00e9gations d\u2019infraction \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 (la requ\u00eate en modification).\n[8] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019il pr\u00e9senterait une requ\u00eate afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 de certaines parties de la preuve de sa cliente (la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9). La d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate sera rendue s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\n[9] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate par \u00e9crit. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019audience.\n[10] Le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la race, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, dans le contexte de l\u2019administration par l\u2019intim\u00e9e du Programme de formation des recrues pour les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e (le FORPE). On trouvera ci-dessous un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte.\n[11] Le plaignant, citoyen naturalis\u00e9 canadien, a postul\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de devenir agent des services frontaliers (ASF).

Le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi tous les examens comportementaux et \u00e9crits de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I et a ensuite entrepris la seconde partie du programme FORPE, \u00e0 la fin de laquelle se trouvait l\u2019examen D-II.

La requ\u00eate en modification du plaignant\n[14] Par sa requ\u00eate en modification, le plaignant souhaite ajouter \u00e0 sa plainte l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination dans le contexte du programme FORPE administr\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, pour les m\u00eames motifs que les all\u00e9gations au titre de l\u2019article 7, mais \u00e9galement en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\n[15] L\u2019article 10 de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\nb) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\nIV. La question en litige\n[16] La question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si le Tribunal doit accueillir la requ\u00eate en modification et ajouter \u00e0 la plainte l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination en contravention de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi.\nV. Le droit relatif \u00e0 la modification des plaintes\nEn g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n[17] Le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour autoriser des modifications en vue de d\u00e9finir \u00ab [\u2026] les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb et de s\u2019assurer que le fait d\u2019autoriser les modifications \u00ab [\u2026] serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice \u00bb (Canderel Lt\u00e9e c.

En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, \u00ab [\u2026] les questions qui d\u00e9coulent d'un m\u00eame ensemble de circonstances factuelles devraient normalement \u00eatre entendues ensemble \u00bb (Cook c.

La modification propos\u00e9e fait simplement en sorte que la plainte soit conforme aux faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[24] Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique (en contravention de l\u2019article 10) d\u00e9coulent des all\u00e9gations de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi et de diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement dont le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\n[25] Du fait qu\u2019elle a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur les faits de la plainte qui \u00e9tayent les all\u00e9gations au titre de l\u2019article 7 et qu\u2019elle les a examin\u00e9s, la Commission a \u00e9galement enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur les faits justifiant l\u2019ajout \u00e0 la plainte d\u2019all\u00e9gations au titre de l\u2019article 10 et les a examin\u00e9s, parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit des m\u00eames faits. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble de la plainte au Tribunal, et la plainte comprend \u00e9galement les faits relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019article 10. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour accorder la modification.\n[26] La plainte contient les all\u00e9gations de fait suivantes \u00e0 l\u2019appui des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique au titre de l\u2019article 10 :\na) le plaignant et deux hommes d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, dans la cinquantaine, ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 au programme FORPE;\nb) un agent occupant un poste inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de surintendant a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le plaignant, contrairement \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait dit au plaignant au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure qui serait suivie;\nc) les \u00e9valuations des comp\u00e9tences sont subjectives, et elles peuvent par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre expos\u00e9es aux pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s individuels des \u00e9valuateurs, comme l\u2019illustre la situation du plaignant;\nd) la diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement dont le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime dans le contexte du programme FORPE t\u00e9moigne de l\u2019application de pratiques discriminatoires de plus grande ampleur lors des \u00e9valuations dont le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet;\ne) l\u2019intim\u00e9e a impos\u00e9 un seuil d\u00e9raisonnable au plaignant (c.-\u00e0-d. une norme plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e) quand elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9 ses comp\u00e9tences.\n[27] La lettre adress\u00e9e par la Commission au plaignant en date du 24 avril 2012 (la lettre de la Commission), (d\u00e9crite par le plaignant comme la lettre de renvoi de l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal) contenait une d\u00e9claration selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] la preuve donne \u00e0 entendre que [\u2026] le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019examen normalis\u00e9 [du] programme de formation du fait de sa race, de son origine nationale ou ethnique ou de son \u00e2ge \u00bb. Le fait que la lettre de la Commission fasse r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des examens [traduction] \u00ab normalis\u00e9s \u00bb invoque les motifs pr\u00e9vus par l\u2019article 10.\n[28] La modification propos\u00e9e fait \u00e9tat d\u2019un nouveau fondement juridique comportant de nouvelles all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, et elle ouvre une nouvelle voie non pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une instruction, ce qui revient \u00e0 introduire fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vue dans la plainte originale et qui va largement au-del\u00e0 de la port\u00e9e et du contenu factuel de cette plainte.\n[29] Cela soul\u00e8ve la m\u00eame question que celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Mus\u00e9e des civilisations, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30, \u00e0 savoir que la modification aurait pour effet de modifier les all\u00e9gations expos\u00e9es dans la plainte \u00ab [\u2026] de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que celle\u2011ci porte sur une nouvelle question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission \u00bb.\n[30] Il existe une distinction entre une plainte de discrimination personnelle en contravention de l\u2019article 7 et une plainte selon laquelle une pratique ou une politique est, en soi, discriminatoire en contravention de l\u2019article 10. Cette distinction en fait des plaintes distinctes. Compte tenu de cette distinction, la modification propos\u00e9e consistant \u00e0 invoquer l\u2019article 10 constitue une nouvelle plainte. Le Tribunal a adopt\u00e9 la distinction \u00e9tablie dans Cook, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. La question de savoir si le programme en cause \u00ab [\u2026] pr\u00e9sente un caract\u00e8re discriminatoire inh\u00e9rent est une question distincte. Elle n'a jamais fait partie de la plainte initiale \u00bb (ibid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 24).\n[31] Par cons\u00e9quent, la modification propos\u00e9e ne d\u00e9coule pas du fond et des faits de la plainte existante, pas plus qu\u2019elle ne fait que rendre la plainte conforme aux faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[32] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour accorder la modification. Premi\u00e8rement, il ressort du paragraphe 44(3) et de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi que le Tribunal n\u2019a la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour conna\u00eetre d\u2019une affaire que si la Commission lui renvoie une plainte. Le fait de permettre une modification dans les circonstances pr\u00e9sentes irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des conditions d\u2019exercice de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pr\u00e9vues par la Loi. \u00c0 ce sujet, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde \u00e9galement sur la d\u00e9cision Mus\u00e9e des civilisations, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 28.\n[33] Deuxi\u00e8mement, la plainte ne comprend pas d\u2019all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 10 \u2013 elle ne contient que des all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 7. Par cons\u00e9quent, lors de son enqu\u00eate, la Commission n\u2019a pas tenu compte du r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 10, mais seulement de celui de l\u2019article 7. La Commission n\u2019a pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019article 10, pas plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019en a trait\u00e9, et, par cons\u00e9quent, elle n\u2019aurait pas pu renvoyer une all\u00e9gation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 10 devant le Tribunal. Pour ce motif \u00e9galement, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour ajouter la modification \u00e0 la plainte.\n[34] En fait, le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate (RE) de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment \u00e9labor\u00e9 au regard de l\u2019article 7 (RE, le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2011, au paragraphe 1, cit\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Ainsi, quand la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal, la lettre de renvoi de la Commission ne faisait pas \u00e9tat de l\u2019article 10, et le Tribunal n\u2019a pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour autoriser la modification.\n[35] Selon le plaignant, les faits de la plainte justifient l\u2019ajout d\u2019all\u00e9gations fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 10, mais ce n\u2019est pas le cas en r\u00e9alit\u00e9. Le plaignant interpr\u00e8te des expressions et des phrases contenues dans la plainte hors de leur contexte. La plainte ne fait \u00e9tat que d\u2019all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la discrimination dont le plaignant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime personnellement, et non \u00e0 de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans le programme FORPE en tant que tel.\n[36] En outre, le plaignant ne pr\u00e9cise clairement ni dans sa plainte ni dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions quelles sont les lignes de conduite qui sont selon lui discriminatoires en contravention de l\u2019article 10.\n[37] Le fait d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab examen normalis\u00e9 \u00bb qui appara\u00eet dans la lettre de la Commission comme englobant une modification qui consiste \u00e0 ajouter des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 \u00e0 la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal revient \u00e0 donner \u00e0 cette expression un sens que ne justifie ni la plainte en tant que telle ni l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission.\n[38] Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019appuie sur toutes les all\u00e9gations de fait relatives \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 pour fonder ses all\u00e9gations au titre de l\u2019article 10. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant. Le seul changement qui appara\u00eet dans les all\u00e9gations de fait dont il est fait \u00e9tat, si on les compare aux all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte, est l\u2019ajout d\u2019un incident au cours duquel le plaignant aurait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement lors de la simulation sur les tactiques et les contr\u00f4les de d\u00e9fense dans le contexte de la partie D-II (la simulation TCD). Par cons\u00e9quent, le lien factuel requis entre la plainte et la modification est pr\u00e9sent. La modification requise ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e0 juste titre qualifi\u00e9e de plainte nouvelle et distincte.\n[39] DansCook, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, la Commission a ajout\u00e9 l\u2019alcoolisme comme \u00e9tant un autre motif de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 la modification au motif qu\u2019elle \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle plainte. Toutefois, cette raison s\u2019est ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle la modification en question soulevait des \u00ab questions profondes \u00bb pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui subirait un pr\u00e9judice dans le cas o\u00f9 il accorderait la modification.\n[40] Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9 son aptitude \u00e0 occuper un emploi. Les examens et les pratiques m\u00eames auxquels on a eu recours dans le contexte de ces \u00e9valuations devraient \u00eatre soigneusement examin\u00e9s en preuve afin tout \u00e0 la fois de donner un aper\u00e7u exhaustif des questions en litige et de d\u00e9finir \u00ab [\u2026] les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb (Canderel, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, cit\u00e9e dans Parent, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et Tabor, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e). Les processus d\u2019examens et d\u2019\u00e9valuation en tant que tels constituent un lien mat\u00e9riel avec la plainte et d\u00e9coulent des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 7.\n[41] Je conclus que la modification requise ne constitue pas une plainte distincte et nouvelle. Je conclus que la modification propos\u00e9e et la plainte ont des liens factuels et de fond. Quand la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal, ce renvoi comprenait toutes les circonstances de la plainte, y compris la discrimination syst\u00e9mique au sens de l\u2019article 10. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne passe pas outre le processus de renvoi pr\u00e9vu par la Loi et il a la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour accorder la modification.\n[42] Le plaignant a joint le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate (RE) de la Commission aux documents et aux arguments relatifs \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate. Je note que le RE recommandait \u00e0 la Commission de rejeter la plainte. Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les r\u00e9ponses des parties au RE, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[43] Compte tenu des circonstances, on ne peut accorder que peu de poids au RE.\n[44] La question de savoir si les documents et la preuve avanc\u00e9s par le plaignant \u00e9tablissent que les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 sont fond\u00e9es sera tranch\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience.\n[45] En ce qui concerne la question de savoir si les documents du plaignant informent l\u2019intim\u00e9e des lignes de conduite qui selon le plaignant contreviendraient \u00e0 l\u2019article 10, je note les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants :\nb) La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\nLe lien entre la plainte et la modification propos\u00e9e\nc) Analyse\na) le plaignant fait valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e voulait le faire \u00e9chouer du fait de son \u00e2ge et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a par ailleurs fait \u00e9chouer deux autres [traduction] \u00ab messieurs plus \u00e2g\u00e9s, dans la cinquantaine \u00bb;\nb) la plainte fait \u00e9tat du fait que les trois \u00e9valuateurs des comp\u00e9tences du plaignant \u00e9taient blancs;\nc) au paragraphe 33 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant qualifie les \u00e9valuations des comp\u00e9tences sous forme de simulation de [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] plus subjectives et pouvoir faire l\u2019objet de davantage de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s et de discrimination \u00bb [que les autres examens administr\u00e9s dans le contexte du programme FORPE];\nd) au paragraphe 34 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant fait valoir que de nombreux candidats d\u2019autres classes qui ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 au programme FORPE \u00e9taient aussi d\u2019\u00e2ge moyen;\ne) le plaignant affirme que les \u00e9valuations des comp\u00e9tences sont subjectives et qu\u2019elles peuvent par cons\u00e9quent faire l\u2019objet des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s individuels des \u00e9valuateurs;\nf) au paragraphe 52 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant soutient que, dans les faits, la pratique consistant \u00e0 faire appel \u00e0 un \u00e9valuateur occupant un poste inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de surintendant a nui \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation;\ng) au paragraphe 54, encore une fois, le plaignant qualifie l\u2019\u00e9valuation des comp\u00e9tences, y compris celles auxquelles il a \u00e9chou\u00e9, de [traduction] \u00ab hautement subjectives \u00bb, ce qui a eu [traduction] \u00ab des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives sur les r\u00e9sultats du plaignant \u00bb parce que sa [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] race, son origine nationale ou ethnique et son \u00e2ge ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le significatif dans ses \u00e9valuations \u00bb; de ce fait, le programme FORPE est [traduction] \u00ab discriminatoire, en contravention de l\u2019article 10 [\u2026] \u00bb;\nh) au paragraphe 55, le plaignant soutient que l\u2019\u00e9valuation des comp\u00e9tences administr\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait discriminatoire, en contravention des articles 7 et 10, vu que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] dans le contexte de cette \u00e9valuation, au terme de laquelle il a \u00e9chou\u00e9, on s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur certains aspects relatifs \u00e0 sa race, sa couleur [sic], son origine nationale ou ethnique et son \u00e2ge \u00bb;\ni) au paragraphe 57, le plaignant affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est servie d\u2019une norme de comp\u00e9tence plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour \u00e9valuer ses comp\u00e9tences que celle dont elle s\u2019est servie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des autres candidats, qui n\u2019avaient aucun attribut commun avec le plaignant sur les plans de la race, de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique ou de l\u2019\u00e2ge; le plaignant fait valoir que le fait que les autres candidats aient fait des erreurs et aient n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9s, alors qu\u2019il a \u00e9chou\u00e9, prouve qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination en contravention des articles 7 et 10.\n[46] Les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus servent tant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir quelles sont les lignes de conduite qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, contreviennent \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 de la Loi qu\u2019\u00e0 en informer l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[47] La lettre de la Commission n\u2019est pas utile pour \u00e9valuer la port\u00e9e de la plainte. La lettre de la Commission \u00e9tait une communication entre la Commission et le plaignant, et non entre la Commission et le Tribunal. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de la lettre de renvoi que la Commission a envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour lancer le processus d\u2019instruction.\n[48] La lettre de renvoi, \u00e0 laquelle la plainte \u00e9tait jointe, est la base sur laquelle le Tribunal agit \u2013 elle lance le processus d\u2019instruction du Tribunal. Dans la lettre de renvoi dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on demandait au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte parce que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, une instruction s\u2019impose \u00bb. L\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] compte tenu de toutes les circonstances \u00bb est large et g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, et il convient de l\u2019interpr\u00e9ter dans un sens large et g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cette expression invite le Tribunal \u00e0 mener une instruction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tous les aspects pertinents d\u2019une plainte.\n[49] Le plaignant fait valoir que la modification propos\u00e9e ne porterait aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle ne fait que rendre la plainte conforme aux faits qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Elle ne consiste pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle plainte parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas question de nouveaux faits. Elle n\u2019ouvre pas \u00ab [\u2026] une nouvelle voie non pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une instruction \u00bb (Gaucher, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 18).\n[50] Contrairement aux all\u00e9gations de retard de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plaignant a en fait demand\u00e9 la modification tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans le processus \u2013 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 31 janvier 2013, il pr\u00e9sentait ses all\u00e9gations au titre de l\u2019article 10 ainsi que son intention de demander la modification. En outre, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas fix\u00e9 de dates pour l\u2019audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait avis\u00e9e de la modification propos\u00e9e depuis le 31 janvier 2013, et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e et au courant des faits sur lesquels le plaignant se fonde pour demander la modification depuis que la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e aura largement le temps de se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audition de la plainte modifi\u00e9e. Il s\u2019ensuit qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 le fait d\u2019autoriser la modification porterait atteinte au droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la justice naturelle en privant celle-ci de son droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et \u00e0 une audition \u00e9quitable.\n[51] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la modification propos\u00e9e lui porterait pr\u00e9judice pour les raisons suivantes.\n[52] La modification propos\u00e9e modifierait la plainte dans une mesure telle qu\u2019elle ouvrirait \u00ab une nouvelle voie non pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une instruction \u00bb, introduisant \u00ab fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte \u00bb.\n[53] Le retard du plaignant \u00e0 invoquer la discrimination syst\u00e9mique a d\u00e9j\u00e0 port\u00e9 pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e au stade de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la Commission parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pu se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019examen de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019article 10.\n[54] Le fait que le Tribunal autorise la modification porterait gravement pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e parce que cela priverait cette derni\u00e8re de l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9fendre sa cause devant la Commission. La plainte et l\u2019enqu\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies en fonction de l\u2019article 7, et non de l\u2019article 10. Toutes les r\u00e9ponses que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a donn\u00e9es lors de la proc\u00e9dure men\u00e9e par la Commission, y compris de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, \u00e9taient ax\u00e9es sur l\u2019article 7. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019a eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 aucune des proc\u00e9dures de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019article 10, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019enqu\u00eate, de conciliation ou de m\u00e9diation. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el et important pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[55] Si le Tribunal autorisait la modification, il en d\u00e9coulerait une violation des droits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, de son droit \u00e0 se voir offrir une juste possibilit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre devant la Commission des all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre elle au titre de l\u2019article 10. C\u2019est similaire \u00e0 ce que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 dans Dillman v. IMP Group Ltd., 1995 CanLII 4254 (NSCA) (Dillman), arr\u00eat dans lequel elle a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision d\u2019accorder une modification qu\u2019une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate avait rendue lors de l\u2019audition de la demande.\n[56] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e subira un pr\u00e9judice parce qu\u2019elle devra produire une [traduction] \u00ab pl\u00e9thore \u00bb de t\u00e9moins, de rapports d\u2019experts et d\u2019analyses statistiques suppl\u00e9mentaires afin de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es au titre de l\u2019article 10, ce qui aura pour effet de retarder de mani\u00e8re significative la date de l\u2019audience. Cela aurait \u00e9galement pour effet d\u2019allonger la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience en tant que telle, ce qui causerait un pr\u00e9judice additionnel \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[57] La modification propos\u00e9e causerait un tel pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e que celle\u2011ci serait priv\u00e9e de sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 compter sur une instruction \u00e9quitable.\n[58] J\u2019ai conclu ci-dessus que la modification propos\u00e9e consistant \u00e0 ajouter \u00e0 la plainte des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique au titre de l\u2019article 10 ne constituait pas une plainte nouvelle et distincte.\n[59] Le fait de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en modification d\u2019une plainte en vue d\u2019y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de discrimination au titre de l\u2019article 10 trois ans apr\u00e8s la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte constitue un long retard. Toutefois, ce retard n\u2019est pas de l\u2019ordre d\u2019un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el et important interdisant la modification.\n[60] L\u2019intim\u00e9e est au courant des all\u00e9gations du plaignant au titre de l\u2019article 10 depuis le 31 janvier 2013, date \u00e0 laquelle le plaignant a inclus ces all\u00e9gations dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de presque tous les faits et incidents sur lesquels le plaignant se fonde, \u00e0 une exception pr\u00e8s, depuis que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Le retard relatif \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate ne porte pas atteinte au droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable devant le Tribunal. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9e a besoin de davantage de temps pour se pr\u00e9parer en vue de l\u2019audience, y compris pour produire des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire et des t\u00e9moins additionnels avant l\u2019audience, une demande raisonnable de temps sera accueillie favorablement. Bien qu\u2019il soit malencontreux, ce retard n\u2019emp\u00eacherait pas injustement l\u2019intim\u00e9e de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience du Tribunal.\n[61] En ce qui concerne l\u2019enqu\u00eate, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant, la preuve documentaire et les documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate \u00e9tayent les all\u00e9gations de fait sur lesquelles le plaignant se fonde. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, ce dernier pr\u00e9cise quelles sont les proc\u00e9dures et les pratiques qui sont selon lui discriminatoires au sens de l\u2019article 10. Le plaignant a inclus une all\u00e9gation additionnelle d\u2019incident qui n\u2019appara\u00eet pas dans la plainte, la simulation TCD, au cours de laquelle le plaignant soutient qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cela dans un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, en appelant des t\u00e9moins additionnels \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, ou de la mani\u00e8re qu\u2019elle choisira.\n[62] Il est \u00e9galement possible d\u2019avoir recours \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation au Tribunal, au moment o\u00f9 les parties le d\u00e9sirent, et ce, jusqu\u2019au commencement de l\u2019audience. Aussi, les parties sont libres de discuter d\u2019une entente priv\u00e9e en tout temps au cours de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[63] Bien que le fait d\u2019accorder la modification puisse retarder la date de l\u2019audience et allonger la dur\u00e9e de celle-ci parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite appeler d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins et produire d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire, le plaignant fait face au m\u00eame retard et au m\u00eame allongement de l\u2019audience. Je ne vois pas cela tant comme un pr\u00e9judice que comme un contretemps.\n[64] Je tiens \u00e9galement compte des \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants.\n[65] Au paragraphe 47 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9fute les all\u00e9gations du plaignant au titre de l\u2019article 10. Au paragraphe 58, l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9fute le fait que les examens des comp\u00e9tences administr\u00e9s dans le contexte du programme FORPE sont subjectifs et ont priv\u00e9 le plaignant de l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des occasions d\u2019emploi, ou que ces examens ont pour effet de tendre \u00e0 refuser des occasions d\u2019emploi \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes ayant les caract\u00e9ristiques du plaignant, et ce, en contravention de l\u2019article 10.\n[66] Au paragraphe 59, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que si le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il y a bien eu discrimination, cela exigerait que le plaignant soit re\u00e7u \u00e0 l\u2019examen des comp\u00e9tences de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-II, y compris aux trois examens des comp\u00e9tences auxquels il a \u00e9chou\u00e9, comp\u00e9tences qui constituent des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) du poste d\u2019ASF, et on ne peut pas donner de suite favorable \u00e0 une telle demande sans causer de contrainte excessive.\n[67] Les paragraphes susmentionn\u00e9s de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e correspondent aux all\u00e9gations du plaignant au titre de

avant l\u2019audience, la combinaison des parties mentionn\u00e9es ci-dessus de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de la partie des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s des t\u00e9moins mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus portent sur les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es par le plaignant au titre de l\u2019article 10 parce qu\u2019elles semblent porter, tout du moins en partie, sur la structure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la proc\u00e9dure et les pratiques du syst\u00e8me de recrutement administr\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elles indiquent que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est en position de monter sa d\u00e9fense \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations du plaignant au titre de l\u2019article 10. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve propos\u00e9s d\u00e9mentent le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e subirait un pr\u00e9judice dans le cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal accorderait la modification propos\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 10.\n[71] En outre, si elle le souhaite, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut produire d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire ou d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, en avisant d\u00fbment les autres parties (le plaignant peut en faire de m\u00eame en r\u00e9ponse). Des dates d\u2019audience n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies et les parties ont par cons\u00e9quent le temps d\u2019agir dans le contexte de leur pr\u00e9paration et de la divulgation continue.\n[72] L\u2019intim\u00e9e cite Cook, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, pour \u00e9tayer sa position. La plainte originale de Mme Cook consistait \u00e0 dire qu\u2019en refusant de l\u2019admettre dans le programme d\u2019apprentissage de l\u2019autonomie fonctionnelle du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience (l\u2019h\u00e9patite C), l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait rendue coupable de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de Mme Cook devant le Tribunal, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e de telle sorte qu\u2019on y ajoute que l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait rendue coupable de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Cook du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience que constitue l\u2019alcoolisme.\n[73] Le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 la demande de modification en partie parce qu\u2019il a conclu qu\u2019elle constituait une plainte nouvelle et distincte, que la Commission ne pouvait pas renvoyer devant lui, et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour traiter de cette question. L\u2019autre fondement sur la base duquel le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser la modification \u00e9tait que, pour reprendre les termes du Tribunal, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait faire face \u00e0 des \u00ab [\u2026] questions profondes \u00bb et \u00ab [\u2026] toute attaque contre cet aspect du programme mine l'une des politiques fondamentales [aucun alcool ni aucune drogue ne sont autoris\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9serve] qui sous-tend le fonctionnement de la r\u00e9serve [de l\u2019intim\u00e9e] \u00bb (ibid, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 25). J\u2019interpr\u00e8te cette d\u00e9claration comme une conclusion selon laquelle la bande d\u2019Onion Lake subirait un v\u00e9ritable pr\u00e9judice si le Tribunal accordait la modification demand\u00e9e.\n[74] L\u2019intim\u00e9e cite \u00e9galement Dillman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a infirm\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision de modification, question qui n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite qu\u2019au stade de l\u2019audience devant la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait nullement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a conclu qu\u2019il ne pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de la modification accord\u00e9e par la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, et par cons\u00e9quent, que cette modification, que la Commission n\u2019avait jamais renvoy\u00e9e devant la commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, lui causerait un r\u00e9el pr\u00e9judice. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 la modification en cause avant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la date de l\u2019audience et l\u2019intim\u00e9e en a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus.\n[75] Pour ce qui est de la question du pr\u00e9judice, je dois \u00e9galement tenir compte du pr\u00e9judice potentiel qui serait caus\u00e9 au plaignant si le Tribunal concluait que la modification demand\u00e9e \u00e9tait une plainte nouvelle et distincte. Cela n\u2019aurait aucun sens, que ce soit sur le plan de la justice naturelle ou de l\u2019\u00e9conomie judiciaire, de demander au plaignant de tout recommencer depuis le d\u00e9but et de d\u00e9poser devant la Commission une autre plainte de discrimination au titre de l\u2019article 10 dans le contexte du programme FORPE \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la m\u00eame intim\u00e9e et sur le fondement des m\u00eames faits. Les deux parties devraient repasser de nouveau par l\u2019ensemble du processus.Le faitd\u2019autoriser la modification \u00e9viterait de porter pr\u00e9judice au plaignant.\n[76] Pour l\u2019ensemble des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, je conclus qu\u2019il y a un lien tant sur le fond que sur la forme entre la plainte et la modification propos\u00e9e; l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice si la modification est autoris\u00e9e; et le fait d\u2019autoriser la modification ne compromettra pas l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience.\n[77] Il convient de noter que le fait d\u2019accorder la modification ne signifie pas que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa plainte, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de l\u2019article 10 ou de l\u2019article 7. Cette question ne pourra \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e qu\u2019au terme de l\u2019audience.\n[78] La plainte est modifi\u00e9e de telle mani\u00e8re que l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb qui appara\u00eet \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re ligne du paragraphe 1 de la plainte soit supprim\u00e9e et remplac\u00e9e par l\u2019expression [traduction] \u00ab en contravention de l\u2019article 7 et de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[79] Le Tribunal tiendra une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance (CGI) aussit\u00f4t que possible, \u00e0 une date convenant aux parties, afin de discuter de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du calendrier pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9pose un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04), si l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite d\u00e9poser un tel document compte tenu de la modification, et pour que le plaignant d\u00e9pose une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, s\u2019il le souhaite.

Le contexte\n[1] Le 20 janvier 2010, M. Geevarughese Johnson Itty, aussi connu sous le nom de M. Johnson Itty (le plaignant), a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte (la plainte) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) contre l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019ASFC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e), all\u00e9guant qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et l\u2019\u00e2ge, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, c. H-6, telle que modifi\u00e9e (la Loi). La plainte a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de telle sorte qu\u2019on y a ajout\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations au titre de l\u2019article 10.\n[2] Le 24 avril 2012, par lettre (la lettre de renvoi), la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi.\n[3] La Commission a fait savoir qu\u2019\u00e0 moins que de nouvelles circonstances l\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 modifier sa position, elle ne prendrait pas part \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[4] Le 31 janvier 2013, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Le 8 mars 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention de le faire.\n[5] Le 11 avril 2013, les parties, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par leurs avocats, et moi, en l\u2019absence de l\u2019avocat de la Commission,avons particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, au cours de laquelle le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il pr\u00e9senterait une requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 de certaines parties de la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9).\n[6] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate par \u00e9crit. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019audience.La Commission n\u2019a pas pris part \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9.\n[7] Dans sa plainte, telle qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e, le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la race, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi, dans le contexte de l\u2019administration par l\u2019intim\u00e9e du programme de formation des recrues pour les points d\u2019entr\u00e9e (FORPE).\n[8] Le plaignant, citoyen naturalis\u00e9 canadien, a postul\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de devenir agent des services frontaliers (ASF). Il a pass\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s la v\u00e9rification initiale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre part, en tant que recrue, au programme FORPE d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de neuf semaines, lequel comporte deux \u00e9tapes d\u2019\u00e9valuation, appel\u00e9es \u00e9tapes de d\u00e9termination : l\u2019\u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination I (D-I) et l\u2019\u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination II (D-II). Les recrues doivent r\u00e9ussir l\u2019ensemble du programme FORPE pour \u00eatre inscrites dans le bassin d\u2019ASF potentiels.\n[9] Le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi tous les examens comportementaux et \u00e9crits de l\u2019\u00e9tape D-I et a ensuite entrepris la seconde partie du programme FORPE, \u00e0 la fin de laquelle se trouvait l\u2019examen D-II. Cette derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape de d\u00e9termination est constitu\u00e9e d\u2019un autre ensemble d\u2019examens \u00e9crits et d\u2019\u00e9valuations comportementales, y compris de sc\u00e9narios de simulation dans le contexte desquels dix comp\u00e9tences sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi l\u2019examen D-II et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrit dans le bassin d\u2019ASF potentiels.\n[10] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de donner davantage de d\u00e9tails sur la plainte.\n[11] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 la divulgation des manuels des \u00e9valuateurs du programme FORPE, de ses propres r\u00e9sultats \u00e0 l\u2019examen administr\u00e9 dans le contexte du programme FORPE et de ceux de plusieurs autres de ses compagnons d\u2019\u00e9tudes, ainsi que d\u2019autres documents, ce qui, comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e le fait valoir, exige que soit rendue une ordonnance en confidentialit\u00e9 de ces documents, assortie de conditions relatives \u00e0 la diffusion de ceux-ci au plaignant et au Tribunal.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 des 13 documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb de l\u2019affidavit de Fernande Surprenant, directrice ex\u00e9cutive par int\u00e9rim de la division de la conception de solutions d\u2019apprentissage de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, sign\u00e9 le 17 mai 2013 (l\u2019affidavit de Mme Surprenant), et que cet affidavit soit soumis \u00e0 certaines conditions relatives \u00e0 sa divulgation. Je ne pr\u00e9cise pas quelles sont ces conditions pr\u00e9cises dans le pr\u00e9sent paragraphe parce qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9volu\u00e9 par suite de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate du plaignant et de la r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[13] Je ne d\u00e9cris pas non plus les arguments des parties en d\u00e9tail parce que celles-ci sont parvenues \u00e0 une entente en ce qui concerne la majeure partie de cette requ\u00eate et de l\u2019ordonnance qui en a d\u00e9coul\u00e9.\n[14] Je ferai r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux 13 documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb de l\u2019affidavit de Mme Surprenant sous l\u2019appellation \u00ab documents de l\u2019annexe \u201cA\u201d \u00bb et je les d\u00e9signerai individuellement en me servant des m\u00eames num\u00e9ros que ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Surprenant.\n[15] La r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e comprend l\u2019affidavit d\u2019Emily MacLeod, assistante juridique aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 souscrit le 13 juin 2013 (l\u2019affidavit de Mme MacLeod).\n[16] La question en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de savoir si le Tribunal devrait accorder la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[17] L\u2019article 52 de la Loi est ainsi libell\u00e9 :\nII. La plainte\nIII. La requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les autres documents relatifs \u00e0 la requ\u00eate\nIV. La question en litige\nV. Les dispositions de la Loi relatives \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9\n(1) L\u2019instruction est publique, mais le membre instructeur peut, sur demande en ce sens, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019il est convaincu que, selon le cas :\na) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique;\nb) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique;\nd) il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\n(2) Le membre instructeur peut, s\u2019il l\u2019estime indiqu\u00e9, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de la demande vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (1).\nVI. Les autres lois applicables\n[18] L\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde \u00e9galement sur la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, L.C. 2003, ch. 22, ainsi que sur les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal), et notamment les articles 3 et 6 des R\u00e8gles.\n[19] Comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9ambule de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, l\u2019objet de la loi est de s\u2019assurer que les nominations au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale soient ax\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite et qu\u2019elles soient non partisanes. En outre, ce m\u00eame pr\u00e9ambule affirme que le principe d\u2019une nomination ax\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite est une valeur qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s important de prot\u00e9ger.\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a recours \u00e0 des manuels de formation et \u00e0 des examens \u00e9crits ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 des examens de simulation aux fins de l\u2019administration de son programme FORPE. Les \u00e9valuateurs et les instructeurs du programme FORPE (ces derniers \u00e9tant aussi appel\u00e9s \u00ab facilitateurs \u00bb) s\u2019engagent par \u00e9crit \u00e0 ne pas r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le contenu des cours ou du mat\u00e9riel d\u2019examen du programme FORPE, y compris les sc\u00e9narios de pratique, ni \u00e0 en discuter avec qui que ce soit en dehors des personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es. Cet engagement est valable avant, pendant et apr\u00e8s le programme FORPE. Le fait de ne pas respecter cet engagement de confidentialit\u00e9 entra\u00eene de graves cons\u00e9quences.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e et ses ASF jouent un r\u00f4le tr\u00e8s important d\u2019aide et de protection en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9placement et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des citoyens canadiens, des r\u00e9sidents et des visiteurs ainsi que du trafic commercial entrant et sortant des vastes fronti\u00e8res canadiennes.\n[22] C\u2019est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Canada et de ses r\u00e9sidents que les ASF soient correctement form\u00e9s, s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s et qualifi\u00e9s pour accomplir cet important travail. C\u2019est ce \u00e0 quoi aspire le programme FORPE. Le programme FORPE fonctionne aussi selon les exigences de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique, qui pr\u00e9voit que les nominations au sein de la fonction publique doivent \u00eatre ax\u00e9es sur le m\u00e9rite et qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre non partisanes, et, en outre, que ces valeurs doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. \u00c0 cette fin, l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 des documents relatifs au programme FORPE \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb doit \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9e; autrement, il existe un risque r\u00e9el que le mat\u00e9riel d\u2019examen de formation ainsi que les sc\u00e9narios d\u2019\u00e9valuation du programme FORPE soient divulgu\u00e9s, que ce soit intentionnellement ou par inadvertance, et des candidats non m\u00e9ritants pourraient r\u00e9ussir ces examens. Cela n\u2019aurait pas seulement pour effet de compromettre le principe de m\u00e9rite et de faire peser sur l\u2019intim\u00e9e une contrainte excessive, mais cela compromettrait \u00e9galement la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public.\n[23] Je suis convaincue, aux termes de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi, que si les documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb \u00e9taient rendus publics au cours de l\u2019instruction, ou du fait que cette instruction est publique, il y aurait un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et de questions personnelles ou autre pour les personnes concern\u00e9es, notamment l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation, pour d\u2019autres raisons que celles qui sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordonnance ci\u2011dessous, l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\n[24] Aux paragraphes 2 et 3 de l\u2019affidavit de Mme MacLeod, la souscriptrice d\u00e9clare, en se fondant sur les renseignements qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, que le plaignant [traduction] \u00ab ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00bb \u00e0 toutes les conditions de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 propos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans son avis de requ\u00eate relativement aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments 1 \u00e0 8 et 11 des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb. La pi\u00e8ce \u00ab A \u00bb de l\u2019affidavit de Mme MacLeod est constitu\u00e9e de copies de deux courriels que le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant a envoy\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pour exposer la position du plaignant.\n[25] Au paragraphe 12 de sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle ne demande pas une ordonnance en confidentialit\u00e9 en ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 9 des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant en a obtenu l\u2019acc\u00e8s apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information.\n[26] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments 10 et 12 correspondent aux r\u00e9sultats obtenus par certains compagnons d\u2019\u00e9tudes du plaignant dans le contexte du programme FORPE. Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il lui faut montrer ces documents aux personnes concern\u00e9es afin de faire valoir pleinement sa cause. Sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions visant \u00e0 assurer la confidentialit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019accord.\n[27] Je conclus que les conditions de l\u2019intim\u00e9e constituent des limites raisonnables \u00e0 la divulgation et qu\u2019elles permettent d\u2019atteindre un \u00e9quilibre entre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server la confidentialit\u00e9 de ces aspects du programme FORPE tout en garantissant le droit du plaignant \u00e0 faire valoir pleinement sa cause. L\u2019ordonnance ci-dessous a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence.\n[28] Le plaignant fait valoir qu\u2019il lui faut montrer ce document \u00e0 un t\u00e9moin expert, dont l\u2019opinion est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le plaignant fasse valoir sa cause. J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les conditions propos\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue de la communication de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 13 \u00e0 l\u2019expert du plaignant. Je conclus que ces conditions constituent des limites raisonnables \u00e0 la divulgation, et elles \u00e9tablissent un \u00e9quilibre entre la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server la confidentialit\u00e9 du document et le droit du plaignant \u00e0 la justice naturelle, y compris le droit de faire pleinement valoir sa cause. L\u2019ordonnance ci-dessous traite de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 13 par cons\u00e9quence.\n[29] La pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ne s\u2019applique pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 9 des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb.\n[30] Tous les documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 9, sont d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la Loi, et ils font \u00e9galement l\u2019objet des modalit\u00e9s suivantes :\nVII. Analyse g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\nVIII. La position du plaignant relative aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments 1 \u00e0 8 et 11 des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb\nIX.

Le Tribunal ne rendra pas publics les documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, ni aucune partie de ces documents.\nc) Le plaignant ou son repr\u00e9sentant se serviront des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb \u00e0 la seule fin de la poursuite de la plainte devant le Tribunal.\nd) Le plaignant et son repr\u00e9sentant ne feront pas de copie des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, ce qui comprend notamment les copies \u00e9lectroniques.\ne) Le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant doit garder les documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb sous cl\u00e9 quand il ne s\u2019en sert pas dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nf) Dans les dix (10) jours suivant l\u2019expiration du droit d\u2019interjeter appel \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte, le repr\u00e9sentant du plaignant, et le plaignant le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, restitueront les documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[31] En ce qui concerne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments 10 et 12 des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, les parties respecteront les conditions suivantes :\na) Le plaignant ne communiquera chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments 10 et 12 qu\u2019au t\u00e9moin concern\u00e9 par l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment en question, \u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de tout autre t\u00e9moin;\nb) Avant que le plaignant communique les \u00e9l\u00e9ments 10 et 12 ou l\u2019un de ces documents au t\u00e9moin \u00e0 qui l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment appartient, le plaignant obtiendra le consentement \u00e9crit du t\u00e9moin \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e divulgue au plaignant et \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant quel est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment qui lui correspond et il fournira ce consentement \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e;\nc) \u00c0 la r\u00e9ception du consentement \u00e9crit du t\u00e9moin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fera savoir au plaignant quel document correspond \u00e0 quel t\u00e9moin;\nd) Le plaignant ne permettra au t\u00e9moin concern\u00e9 de consulter les documents en cause qu\u2019au bureau de son repr\u00e9sentant ou lors des audiences devant le Tribunal;\ne) Le plaignant et son repr\u00e9sentant, ou l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre, ne fourniront pas au t\u00e9moin sa propre copie des documents.\n[32] En ce qui concerne l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 13 des documents de l\u2019annexe \u00ab A \u00bb, les parties respecteront les conditions suivantes :\na) Avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fournisse l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 13 ou une copie de celui\u2011ci au plaignant, et avant que le plaignant fournisse une copie de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 13 \u00e0 son t\u00e9moin expert, le plaignant communiquera \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e le nom et les qualifications de son t\u00e9moin expert;\nb) Les alin\u00e9as a) \u00e0 f) du paragraphe 2 de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance s\u2019appliqueront avec les modifications qui s\u2019imposent au t\u00e9moin expert du plaignant;\nc) Avant que le plaignant remette l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment 13 \u00e0 son t\u00e9moin expert, le plaignant ou son repr\u00e9sentant devront fournir au t\u00e9moin expert une copie de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance en confidentialit\u00e9 et obtenir de celui-ci une attestation \u00e9crite et dat\u00e9e dans laquelle il reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il a lu l\u2019ordonnance en confidentialit\u00e9 et qu\u2019il convient d\u2019\u00eatre li\u00e9 par ses termes.\nSign\u00e9e par\nOlga Luftig\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe 16 d\u00e9cembre 2013",

En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a simplement \u00e9valu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative le rendement au travail de la plaignante, sans tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait servie des appr\u00e9ciations du rendement de la plaignante pour comparer cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 une autre employ\u00e9e dans le but de d\u00e9cider laquelle des deux serait licenci\u00e9e, le Tribunal a conclu que la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante avait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision prise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne plus la garder \u00e0 son service.\n[2] Pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a demand\u00e9, entre autres, les mesures de redressement suivantes :\n[Traduction]\nCotisations de retraite perdues\n78. Si la plaignante avait conserv\u00e9 son emploi chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e, elle aurait eu droit aux avantages d\u00e9coulant de sa participation au r\u00e9gime de pension de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de 2007 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui (en plus, bien entendu, des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes au cours desquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Le r\u00e9gime de pension dont la plaignante \u00e9tait membre est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es. Cela signifie qu\u2019\u00e0 sa retraite, la plaignante a le droit de recevoir une pension d\u2019un montant d\u00e9termin\u00e9 en fonction d\u2019une certaine formule. Les membres de ce r\u00e9gime de pension cotisent 7 % de leur salaire annuel et l\u2019intim\u00e9e est responsable de garantir que les obligations du fonds de pension sont respect\u00e9es.\n79. Dans le cas o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 temporairement absent du travail, la partie de l\u2019intim\u00e9e des cotisations de retraite est calcul\u00e9e \u00e0 7 % du salaire de l\u2019employ\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e.\n80. Ce calcul n\u2019est requis que dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 ne retourne pas au travail chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Si le r\u00e9tablissement de p\u00e9riode de service valid\u00e9e nette \u00e0 partir de la date d\u2019entr\u00e9e en service est ordonn\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le calcul n\u2019est pas requis.\n81. Si le r\u00e9tablissement n\u2019est pas ordonn\u00e9, mais qu\u2019il est conclu qu\u2019il y a eu responsabilit\u00e9, alors les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de la plaignante sont estim\u00e9s \u00e0 environ 17 087,42 $.\n(Observations finales de la plaignante, dat\u00e9es du 16 mars 2011, aux paragraphes 78 \u00e0 81)\n[3] Dans Grant (d\u00e9cision), le Tribunal a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence quant \u00e0 une grande partie des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es par la plaignante, y compris les cotisations de retraite perdues, afin d\u2019obtenir des observations et des clarifications suppl\u00e9mentaires de la part des parties (au paragraphe 128).\n[4] Les deux parties ont eu l\u2019occasion, dans le cadre d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique tenue le 10 juillet 2012, de pr\u00e9senter des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet des demandes de redressement de la plaignante qui restaient en suspens apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision Grant (d\u00e9cision).\n[5] Dans une d\u00e9cision ult\u00e9rieure, Heather Lynn Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 20 [Grant (redressements)], le Tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 quelles mesures de redressement \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes de redressement de la plaignante qui restaient en suspens depuis la d\u00e9cision Grant (d\u00e9cision). Entre autres, le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de preuves pour r\u00e9\u00e9valuer quelle personne, la plaignante ou l\u2019autre employ\u00e9e, aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre licenci\u00e9e. En fait, le Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que, dans les circonstances, il rem\u00e9diait \u00e0 \u00ab [...] la chance qu\u2019a perdue la plaignante de faire appr\u00e9cier son rendement de mani\u00e8re non discriminatoire et, par cons\u00e9quent, la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait, tout comme une autre candidate, de conserver l\u2019emploi qu\u2019elle exer\u00e7ait aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00bb (Grant (redressements), au paragraphe 7). Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 : \u00ab La difficult\u00e9 que pose la conception d\u2019une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e dans le cas pr\u00e9sent r\u00e9side dans le fait que, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019acte discriminatoire commis, il y avait au moins une possibilit\u00e9 de 50 % qu\u2019on aurait licenci\u00e9 la plaignante de toute fa\u00e7on. \u00bb (Grant (redressements), au paragraphe 7).\n[6] En raison de ce raisonnement, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 ce qui suit en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pension de la plaignante :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e replacera les prestations de retraite de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement. Pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9tendant entre la date du licenciement et celle de l\u2019application des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e contribuera au r\u00e9gime de pension la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations de retraite qu\u2019elle aurait faites au cours de cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service. S\u2019il est impossible de r\u00e9tablir le r\u00e9gime de retraite ant\u00e9rieur, il faudra prendre les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9tablir les prestations de retraite perdues, de la mani\u00e8re d\u00e9crite plus t\u00f4t, dans un r\u00e9gime ou un programme comparable en veillant \u00e0 ce que la plaignante puisse toucher des prestations de retraite qui se comparent \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues par l\u2019entremise de MTS. Je laisserai d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails des prestations de retraite que la plaignante a perdues, conform\u00e9ment aux param\u00e8tres indiqu\u00e9s dans mes motifs.\n(Grant (redressements), au paragraphe 22)\n[7] Dans Grant (redressements), le Tribunal est rest\u00e9 saisi de l\u2019affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties n\u2019arriveraient pas \u00e0 une entente au sujet du redressement quant \u00e0 la pension, entre autres (au paragraphe 23).\n[8] Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de s\u2019entendre sur les d\u00e9tails de la pension perdue de la plaignante et ne s\u2019entendent pas sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la mesure de redressement que le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[9] Les parties s\u2019entendent au sujet du fait que l\u2019obligation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en fonction de l\u2019ordonnance qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de est de remettre les prestations de pension de la plaignante dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouvaient au moment du licenciement et au sujet du fait que ces prestations peuvent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es en vertu du r\u00e9gime de pension de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elles ne s\u2019entendent pas au sujet de ce qui est d\u00fb \u00e0 la plaignante \u00e0 partir de la date de son licenciement : 50 % des cotisations de retraite que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait faites, ou 50 % des prestations de pension que la plaignante aurait re\u00e7ues, moins les cotisations que la plaignante aurait faites.\n[10] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate suivante fournit des directives suppl\u00e9mentaires aux parties en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019application de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal au sujet de la pension de la plaignante.\nII. Les positions des parties A. La plaignante [11] La plaignante soutient que le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 le r\u00e9tablissement de ses prestations de pension.\n[12] Le r\u00e9gime de pension est un r\u00e9gime \u00e0 prestations d\u00e9termin\u00e9es et, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne contribue pas un montant d\u00e9fini et certain \u00e0 intervalles r\u00e9guliers. En fait, l\u2019intim\u00e9e cotise au r\u00e9gime de pension un montant suffisant, en fonction des conditions du march\u00e9, pour garantir que les retrait\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent leurs prestations pr\u00e9cises et d\u00e9finies. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon la plaignante, le montant des cotisations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au r\u00e9gime de pension aurait pu n\u2019avoir aucune r\u00e9percussion sur le montant de prestations qu\u2019elle recevrait.\n[13] En fait, la plaignante soutient que l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal visait \u00e0 indemniser la plaignante et \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir ses prestations de pension. \u00c0 ce sujet, aux paragraphes 15 et 22 de Grant (redressements), la plaignante soutient que le Tribunal semble sugg\u00e9rer une m\u00e9thode pour en arriver \u00e0 l\u2019objectif ultime d\u2019indemniser la plaignante et de r\u00e9tablir ses prestations de pension : que l\u2019intim\u00e9e cotise \u00e0 son r\u00e9gime de pension \u00ab la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations qu\u2019elle aurait effectu\u00e9es au cours de cette p\u00e9riode si la plaignante \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e \u00e0 son service \u00bb. La plaignante soutient que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de simplement verser au r\u00e9gime de pension un montant estim\u00e9 de cotisations, mais qu\u2019il a plut\u00f4t laiss\u00e9 entendre que cela pouvait \u00eatre une possibilit\u00e9 ou une m\u00e9thode possible d\u2019en arriver \u00e0 l\u2019objectif ultime d\u2019indemniser la plaignante.\n[14] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante est d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit garantir \u00e0 la plaignante des prestations de retraite comparables \u00e0 celles qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ues si elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 licenci\u00e9e (moins 50 %). La plaignante a fourni un rapport actuariel dans lequel le montant mensuel de prestations qu\u2019elle a perdues en raison de son licenciement a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9.\n[15] Subsidiairement, si l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision Grant (redressements) est correcte et que cette d\u00e9cision accordait des cotisations de retraite, par opposition \u00e0 des prestations, la plaignante soutient que l\u2019\u00e9valuation des cotisations faites par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est incompl\u00e8te. Selon la plaignante, le rapport actuariel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne calculait que les cotisations normales et ne tenait pas compte des cotisations sp\u00e9ciales et de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. Lorsqu\u2019on ajoute ces montants au total de cotisations normales de 17 789,72 $, le montant des cotisations totales est de 98 863,81 $. Si ce montant \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 en un versement unique \u00e0 la plaignante, celle-ci soutient qu\u2019elle serait indemnis\u00e9e.\n[16] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 ses observations finales au sujet du redressement pour sa pension, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019il faut se rappeler que le redressement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 dans le contexte de ce qui, selon la plaignante, \u00e9tait un sc\u00e9nario improbable, soit que la plainte serait accueillie, mais qu\u2019aucune r\u00e9int\u00e9gration ne soit ordonn\u00e9e; que le calcul fourni a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 en fonction de circonstances qui ont maintenant plus de trois ans; que les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s avant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ne sont pas pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9cision; et que l\u2019utilisation du concept de \u00ab cotisations \u00bb \u00e9tait une approximation rapide des prestations de pension en l\u2019absence de preuve actuarielle.\nB. L\u2019intim\u00e9e [17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e croit que le Tribunal lui a ordonn\u00e9 de payer 50 % des cotisations de retraite qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2007 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date d\u2019application de l\u2019ordonnance. Le rapport actuariel de l\u2019intim\u00e9e calcule que la moiti\u00e9 de ses cotisations du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2007 au 1er juin 2013 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 17 789,72 $.\n[18] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal \u00e9tablit une distinction claire entre a) les diff\u00e9rents moments et b) les types d\u2019indemnisation. Les deux moments pr\u00e9cis sont : a) le moment du licenciement et b) la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date o\u00f9 l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e. Les deux types d\u2019indemnisation sont : a) les prestations de pension et b) les cotisations de retraite. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ordonnance n\u2019utilise pas les termes cotisations et prestations de fa\u00e7on interchangeable et chaque terme est li\u00e9 \u00e0 son propre moment pr\u00e9cis.\n[19] Selon l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ordonnance concorde avec la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de ne pas r\u00e9tablir la plaignante dans son emploi. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la partie de l\u2019ordonnance portant sur les prestations de pension co\u00efncide avec la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019emploi de la plaignante chez l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Apr\u00e8s ce moment, selon l\u2019ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit effectuer des cotisations de retraite. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il serait illogique de ne pas r\u00e9tablir la plaignante dans son emploi, mais de r\u00e9tablir les prestations de pension comme si le Tribunal avait ordonn\u00e9 le r\u00e9tablissement de la plaignante dans son emploi.\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal de fournir des directives en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019application de son ordonnance et elle note que l\u2019application de l\u2019ordonnance est le domaine pr\u00e9cis au sujet duquel le Tribunal a express\u00e9ment r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence, compte tenu du peu de preuves portant sur l\u2019administration du r\u00e9gime de retraite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (voir Grant (redressements), au paragraphe 15). Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e note que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance quant au fond de l\u2019affaire et elle soutient que le Tribunal est dessaisi en ce qui a trait au redressement pr\u00e9vu pour la pension comme tel dans l\u2019ordonnance.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soul\u00e8ve la question parce qu\u2019elle est d\u2019avis que la position et les observations de la plaignante sont une tentative de revoir l\u2019ordonnance quant \u00e0 la pension ou de porter celle-ci en appel. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la plaignante a toujours demand\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre indemnis\u00e9e pour les cotisations de retraite qu\u2019elle a perdues, et non pour les prestations. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 la position de la plaignante dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et dans ses observations \u00e9crites finales qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante ne peut pas maintenant pr\u00e9senter une demande diff\u00e9rente.\nIII. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [22] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 correctement l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante la moiti\u00e9 de ses prestations de pension pour la p\u00e9riode suivant son licenciement. Plut\u00f4t, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 vise la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations de retraite faites par l\u2019employeur pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement.\n[23] Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal de ne pas r\u00e9tablir la plaignante dans son emploi, l\u2019ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en vue d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre la p\u00e9riode avant et la p\u00e9riode apr\u00e8s le licenciement. Pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le licenciement, le Tribunal souhaitait \u00e9tablir clairement que la plaignante devait recevoir ses prestations compl\u00e8tes de pension, question qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en litige entre les parties. Pour la p\u00e9riode suivant le licenciement, seulement la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations de retraite que l\u2019employeur aurait faites a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e. La moiti\u00e9, parce que le Tribunal a conclu au fait que la plaignante partageait la possibilit\u00e9 avec une autre candidate de conserver son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et non \u00e0 la perte d\u2019emploi comme tel. De plus, l\u2019ordonnance ne visait que les cotisations de retraite par l\u2019employeur, parce que la plaignante n\u2019a pas perdu ses propres cotisations. Elle n\u2019a simplement pas cotis\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime de pension apr\u00e8s son licenciement.\n[24] Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas d\u2019expertise pour interpr\u00e9ter et calculer les pensions. Le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli le redressement quant \u00e0 la pension en fonction des observations des parties et de la preuve dont il \u00e9tait saisi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Pendant la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance de juillet 2012, lors de laquelle les parties ont eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter des observations au sujet des redressements en suspens de la d\u00e9cision Grant (d\u00e9cision), la plaignante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ses calculs quant \u00e0 la partie de l\u2019intim\u00e9e des cotisations de retraite perdues \u00e9taient une estimation en l\u2019absence de calculs d\u2019un actuaire. En fait, divers articles du r\u00e9gime de pension vis\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pr\u00e9voient l\u2019ajustement et le calcul des cotisations et des prestations en fonction de recommandations d\u2019un actuaire. C\u2019est pourquoi le Tribunal a d\u2019abord laiss\u00e9 aux parties le soin d\u2019\u00e9tablir les d\u00e9tails du redressement quant \u00e0 la pension :\nCompte tenu des difficult\u00e9s et des consid\u00e9rations qui peuvent entrer en jeu dans la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019application de cette ordonnance, compte tenu du manque de preuves permettant de d\u00e9terminer le mieux possible l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, compte tenu de l\u2019admission des parties selon laquelle il faudra peut-\u00eatre recourir aux services d\u2019un actuaire pour effectuer ces calculs de retraite, et compte tenu du fait que les preuves qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es pour faire ces calculs sont insuffisantes, je laisserai donc d\u2019abord aux parties le soin de r\u00e9gler les d\u00e9tails des prestations de retraite perdues de la plaignante dans le cadre des param\u00e8tres susmentionn\u00e9s.\n(Grant (redressements), au paragraphe 15)\n[25] Selon le Tribunal, les parties \u00e9taient les mieux plac\u00e9es pour calculer le montant du redressement quant \u00e0 la pension et pour d\u00e9terminer quelle \u00e9tait la meilleure fa\u00e7on de mettre ce redressement en \u0153uvre. Malheureusement, les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incapables de s\u2019entendre \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[26] Cela dit, les parties ont maintenant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal des rapports actuariels, qui aident \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le redressement. Les deux rapports semblent concorder en ce qui a trait au fait que la moiti\u00e9 des cotisations normales de l\u2019employeur couvrant la p\u00e9riode du 23 f\u00e9vrier 2007 au 1er juin 2013 serait d\u2019un montant de 17 789,72 $.\n[27] Cependant, en r\u00e9plique, la plaignante a soulev\u00e9 un argument subsidiaire et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un rapport actuariel suppl\u00e9mentaire, dans lequel il est soutenu que le rapport de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne tenait pas compte des cotisations sp\u00e9ciales et de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. Le fait de soulever cet argument subsidiaire et de pr\u00e9senter ce rapport suppl\u00e9mentaire en r\u00e9plique n\u2019aide pas \u00e0 trancher la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et est injuste envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019argument subsidiaire aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 dans le cadre des observations initiales de la plaignante quant \u00e0 la question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[28] Cela dit, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice, le Tribunal souhaite s\u2019assurer que la plaignante, une victime de discrimination, re\u00e7oive le montant complet qui lui est d\u00fb en vertu de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de revoir l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la pension, mais plut\u00f4t de garantir que l\u2019ordonnance est appliqu\u00e9e correctement.\n[29] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit fournir une r\u00e9ponse au rapport actuariel suppl\u00e9mentaire de la plaignante et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, au sujet des cotisations sp\u00e9ciales et de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat, au plus tard le 31 janvier 2014. Par la suite, la plaignante aura jusqu\u2019au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2014 pour fournir une r\u00e9plique. Le Tribunal rappelle \u00e0 la plaignante que l\u2019objectif de la r\u00e9plique n\u2019est pas de soulever de nouveaux arguments, mais de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ceux soulev\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[30] Apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires, et seulement si le Tribunal le juge n\u00e9cessaire, une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance pourra \u00eatre tenue pour obtenir d\u2019autres pr\u00e9cisions de la part des parties au sujet de leurs observations suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[31] Je conserverai ma comp\u00e9tence au sujet du redressement quant \u00e0 la pension jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la question soit d\u00e9finitivement tranch\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9 par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 19 d\u00e9cembre 2013",

Le contexte\n[1] La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la pr\u00e9sente plainte conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la Loi). La plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience au titre des articles 7, 10 et 14 de la Loi.\n[2] Le 24 janvier 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 la communication de documents m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante ainsi que de documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le contexte de la poursuite en justice pour pr\u00e9judice corporel que cette derni\u00e8re avait intent\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l\u2019accident de voiture qu\u2019elle a eu en 2007.\n[3] Le 20 mars 2013, Mme Marchildon, membre instructrice, a rendu une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate qui pr\u00e9cisait de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9e la position des parties concernant la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e visant \u00e0 obtenir :\n(a) les documents m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er avril 2007 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui;\n(b) la version int\u00e9grale des dossiers psychiatrique et psychologique de la plaignante;\n(c) les documents relatifs \u00e0 la poursuite en justice pour pr\u00e9judice corporel que la plaignante a intent\u00e9e;\n(d) l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement relative \u00e0 la poursuite en justice pour pr\u00e9judice corporel que la plaignante a intent\u00e9e.\n[4] Mme Marchildon a rendu une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question a), \u00e0 savoir les documents m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante, ainsi que des questions c) et d), \u00e0 savoir les documents relatifs \u00e0 la poursuite en justice pour pr\u00e9judice corporel que la plaignante a intent\u00e9e et l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement (qui pr\u00e9voyait que le tiers mis en cause dans cette entente produirait des observations additionnelles). Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate ne portera pas sur les questions a) et c). D\u2019autres \u00e9changes ont eu lieu entre les parties au sujet de la question d), et la plaignante a fait savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de retrouver les trois intim\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient parties \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Sous r\u00e9serve des discussions plus approfondies qui se tiendront \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question d) lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance le 9 janvier 2014, je me prononcerai sur cette question lors de cette conf\u00e9rence ou \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure.\n[5] En ce qui concerne la question b), \u00e0 savoir la version int\u00e9grale des dossiers psychiatrique et psychologique de la plaignante, Mme Marchildon a demand\u00e9 aux parties de produire des observations additionnelles, et je reviendrai sur cette question plus tard dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[6] La plaignante, \u00e0 la suite de la demande de communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dat\u00e9e du 24 janvier 2013, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande informelle de communication par lettre dat\u00e9e du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2013, dans laquelle elle demandait les renseignements suivants :\n(a) des notes, des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s et d\u2019autres renseignements enregistr\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019interrogatoire de Michelle Baly \u00e0 laquelle Barry Hicks a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 le ou vers le 28 septembre 2000, et dont il est fait mention dans la sp\u00e9cification 2.0065 de la GRC;\n(b) l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du contenu du dossier relatif au code de conduite concernant l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur le s.\u00e9.\u2011m.

Lenger (au paragraphe 8); et\n\u00b7 les curriculums vitae des candidats s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s, ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, des documents de l\u2019\u00e9poque en cause concernant les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents, la formation, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience, les rapports de rendement ou d\u2019autres consid\u00e9rations relatives au processus de s\u00e9lection (au paragraphe 10).\n[8] Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2013, la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir les renseignements suivants :\n(a) toute \u00e9tude r\u00e9cente portant sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sein de la GRC;\n(b) tout rapport r\u00e9cent portant sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sein de la GRC;\n(c) l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00ab \u00c0 vous la parole \u00bb de juin-juillet 2012 relative aux employ\u00e9s de la division \u00ab E \u00bb de la GRC qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite par la sous-direction de la strat\u00e9gie op\u00e9rationnelle, division \u00ab E \u00bb;\n(d) le rapport sommaire de la division \u00ab E \u00bb de la Gendarmerie royale canadienne sur le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe et consultations pour un milieu de travail respectueux, du 17 avril 2012.\nII. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\n[9] Les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi sont les suivantes : A) la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir la version int\u00e9grale des dossiers psychiatrique et psychologique de la plaignante; B) la demande de communication de la Commission dat\u00e9e du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2013; C) les demandes de communication de la plaignante dat\u00e9es du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2013 et du 12 avril 2013.\n[10] L\u2019affaire dont le Tribunal est saisi a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite par la demande de communication de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et les autres demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 introduites et formul\u00e9es dans la correspondance \u00e9chang\u00e9e par la plaignante et la Commission. L\u2019exigence de divulgation compl\u00e8te est une condition essentielle d\u2019une instruction \u00e9quitable. De toute \u00e9vidence, les parties ne contestent pas les exigences de production et de divulgation. Toutefois, la question de la pertinence de la preuve soul\u00e8ve des craintes chez les parties. L\u2019exigence de divulgation est pr\u00e9vue aux alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles), comme Mme Marchildon l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe 28 de sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 20 mars 2013 (2013 TCDP 6).\n[11] Voici la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate rendue par le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des demandes de communication de documents formul\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante et la Commission, laquelle tient d\u00fbment compte des principes susmentionn\u00e9s.\nA. La demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en vue d\u2019obtenir la version int\u00e9grale des dossiers psychiatrique et psychologique de la plaignante\n[12] Dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle a rendue, Mme Marchildon a d\u00e9fini un calendrier selon lequel les parties devaient produire leurs observations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la question en litige. La plaignante, par lettre dat\u00e9e du 4 avril 2013, a formul\u00e9 la proposition suivante :\n[traduction]\nLe dossier du Dr Babbage comprend six pages; sur une seule de ces pages, certains passages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s. Le dossier du Dr Sanders comprend sept pages; certains passages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s sur quatre de ces pages. Nous avons communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC une copie int\u00e9grale de tous les documents que le cabinet du Dr Flamer nous a fait parvenir en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 notre demande de communication de son dossier. Consid\u00e9rant qu\u2019il n\u2019est question que de cinq pages, nous faisons valoir qu\u2019il convient que le Tribunal examine les pages en cause en m\u00eame temps que la plainte et la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la plainte afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir si les renseignements qui y sont contenus sont susceptibles de lancer une instruction qui tendrait \u00e0 prouver ou \u00e0 r\u00e9futer un fait en litige essentiel et \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la question de la validit\u00e9 du privil\u00e8ge de confidentialit\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9 par le cap. Rai.\n[13] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 avril 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a envoy\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse suivante :\n[traduction]\nEn ce qui a trait aux dossiers m\u00e9dicaux caviard\u00e9s que la plaignante a produits, l\u2019intim\u00e9e souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019approche adopt\u00e9e par la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du caviardage, telle qu\u2019elle l\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans sa lettre du 4 avril 2013. Cependant, non content d\u2019avoir caviard\u00e9 ses dossiers psychiatrique et psychologique, la plaignante a aussi largement caviard\u00e9 les notes cliniques de son m\u00e9decin de famille, le Dr Andre Bredenkarnp. La plaignante a remplac\u00e9 16 pages des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Bredenkarnp par 16 pages vierges intitul\u00e9es \u00ab non pertinent \u00bb\". L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 la plaignante de produire l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 du dossier du Dr Bredenkarnp.\n[14] Dans une large mesure, les parties ont r\u00e9solu la question dans leur correspondance, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite ci-dessus, et le Tribunal adopte leur solution. En ce qui a trait aux dossiers du Dr Babbage et du Dr Saunders, le Tribunal demande que les pages caviard\u00e9es de leurs dossiers lui soient communiqu\u00e9es afin qu\u2019il \u00e9tablisse quels sont les privil\u00e8ges applicables.\n[15] Je traiterai la question des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux du Dr Bredenkamp de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les dossiers du Dr Babbage et du Dr Saunder. J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019envoyer la version int\u00e9grale des 16 pages caviard\u00e9es du dossier du Dr Bredenkamp pour que le Tribunal les examine, et je rendrai ma d\u00e9cision en me fondant sur le caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 et la pertinence de la communication en cause.\nB. La demande de communication de la Commission\n[16] Par lettre dat\u00e9e du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2013, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que lui soient communiqu\u00e9s un certain nombre de rapports et d\u2019\u00e9tudes qui sont en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Cette derni\u00e8re est d\u2019avis que ces rapports et \u00e9tudes ne sont pas pertinents dans le contexte de la plainte et qu\u2019ils n\u2019auraient aucune incidence sur la pr\u00e9sente instruction.\n[17] Pour \u00e9tayer sa position, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur le paragraphe 64 (qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 incorrectement cit\u00e9 \u00e9tant comme le paragraphe 66) de Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61 (Moore), dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada s\u2019est ainsi exprim\u00e9e :\n[\u2026] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au nom de Jeffrey, et tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayant concr\u00e8tement cette demande le concernaient directement. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait certes autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir compte de la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique afin de d\u00e9cider si Jeffrey avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, mais il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il se livre \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate approfondie sur la structure pr\u00e9cise des m\u00e9canismes de financement provinciaux ou sur tous les aspects de l\u2019administration par la province de l\u2019\u00e9ducation sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9e pour d\u00e9cider si Jeffrey avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. \u00c0 mon humble avis, le Tribunal a pour r\u00f4le de statuer sur la plainte particuli\u00e8re dont il est saisi, non d\u2019agir comme une commission royale d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[18] Selon la Commission, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sein de diff\u00e9rentes unit\u00e9s de la GRC ainsi que le d\u00e9faut pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la GRC de s\u2019attaquer de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate au harc\u00e8lement sexuel et de fournir un lieu de travail qui en soit exempt se trouvent au c\u0153ur du litige. Sur ce fondement, elle fait valoir que toute \u00e9tude ou tout rapport r\u00e9cent portant sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sein de la GRC peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions en litige dans la plainte, y compris des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9mique qui s\u2019imposent. Pour \u00e9tayer ses propos, la Commission a produit les paragraphes 6 et 7 de Warman c. Bahr, 2006 TCDP 18. En se fondant sur cette d\u00e9cision, elle soutient que le seuil quant \u00e0 la pertinence est peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 et que la tendance qui se dessine maintenant favorise une communication de documents plus \u00e9tendue que moins \u00e9tendue parce qu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir, au stade de la communication, si un document pourra finalement s\u2019av\u00e9rer pertinent lors de l\u2019audition de la plainte.\n[19] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que la Commission a \u00e9tabli que les documents qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9s \u00e9taient pertinents, et, par cons\u00e9quent, les rapports qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9s lui seront communiqu\u00e9s. Bien que l\u2019instruction du Tribunal soit ax\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, il est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019on peut se servir de la preuve de l\u2019existence d\u2019un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique pour \u00e9tablir si un plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination; voir (Canada (Human Rights Commission) c. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 1998 CanLII 7740 (CF), au paragraphe 22; et Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445, aux paragraphes 389 et 390). En r\u00e9alit\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur Moore, mais je suis d\u2019avis que cet arr\u00eat milite en faveur de la communication demand\u00e9e, comme l\u2019illustre l\u2019extrait suivant : \u00ab Le Tribunal \u00e9tait certes autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 tenir compte de la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique afin de d\u00e9cider si Jeffrey avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination [...] \u00bb (Moore, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 64).\nC. Les demandes de communication de la plaignante\n(i) Les demandes a) \u00e0 c)\n[20] Lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance qui s\u2019est tenue le 2 octobre 2013, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a confirm\u00e9 que tous les documents relatifs aux questions a) \u00e0 c) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits parmi les documents que sa cliente a communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 ce jour, et elle a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait fait de son mieux pour rassembler ces documents. L\u2019avocate de la plaignante a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait convaincue que l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019\u00e9tait efforc\u00e9e de trouver ces documents. Par cons\u00e9quent, la pr\u00e9sente question ne se pose plus.\n(ii) Les demandes d) et e)\n[21] Selon la plaignante, la pertinence des documents demand\u00e9s d\u00e9coule de son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les actes discriminatoires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont fait en sorte qu\u2019elle \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e de toute possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avancement fond\u00e9e sur sa sp\u00e9cialisation dans les postes des EISN et de la SEG. L\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que des candidats qualifi\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour occuper ces postes. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante pr\u00e9tend que les comp\u00e9tences de ces candidats sont directement en cause dans la plainte.\n[22] Lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, l\u2019avocate de la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que ses demandes de documents d) et e) seraient satisfaites par un curriculum vitae ou d\u2019autres documents permettant essentiellement d\u2019en dresser un. Dans des \u00e9changes ant\u00e9rieurs, l\u2019avocate de la plaignante a laiss\u00e9 entendre que les documents demand\u00e9s, ou des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s similaires d\u2019exp\u00e9rience, de formation et de comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient disponibles dans le syst\u00e8me d\u2019information sur la gestion des ressources humaines de la GRC (le SIGRH).\n[23] Lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle demanderait \u00e0 sa cliente de lui donner des instructions en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la communication des documents relatifs aux demandes d) et e).\n[24] Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de la plaignante selon laquelle ces documents sont pertinents. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fera de son mieux pour obtenir les renseignements requis en passant en revue les dossiers personnels du gend. Eric Lenger et du cap. Keneckt, comme l\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 la plaignante. La question de savoir si ces documents sont admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quelle est leur valeur probante, reste \u00e0 trancher; toutefois, ils devraient \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s.\n(iii) La demande f)\n[25] La communication des documents de la demande f) est toujours en suspens; toutefois, lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en train de caviarder les documents en question et qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention de produire ces documents une fois qu\u2019elle aurait termin\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce sur cette question pour l\u2019instant.\n(iv) La demande g)\n[26] Lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019intention de produire toutes les parties pertinentes du dossier en cause, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019avocate de la plaignante, et, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce sur cette question pour l\u2019instant.\n(v) La demande h)\n[27] Lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a affirm\u00e9 et confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait efforc\u00e9e d\u2019obtenir ces documents. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait besoin des courriels de Ric Hall et elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas les courriels requis. L\u2019avocate de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 si l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait essay\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir ces courriels ou de les consulter par voie \u00e9lectronique autrement qu\u2019en demandant \u00e0 M. Hall si ces documents existaient. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a confirm\u00e9 que ces documents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en la possession de sa cliente et qu\u2019elle n\u2019y avait pas acc\u00e8s. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal ne se prononce pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette question.\n(vi) La demandei)\n[28] Cette question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence de gestion de l\u2019instance. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne semblait pas qu\u2019il existe de guide sur les enqu\u00eates internes, mais que des documents plus g\u00e9n\u00e9raux relatifs \u00e0 cette question avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la liste compl\u00e9mentaire de documents la plus r\u00e9cente de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2000\u20132001, sa cliente n\u2019avait pas de politique pr\u00e9cise en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que je me prononce sur cette question.\nIII.

Requ\u00eate en jonction des instructions portant sur deux plaintes [1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision fait suite \u00e0 une requ\u00eate de la plaignante, Ashraf Karimi, pour que soit rendue une ordonnance joignant, aux fins d\u2019une seule instruction, deux dossiers (nos T1616\/16210 et T1783\/1312) du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal).\n[2] Le 4 novembre 2010, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H\u20116 (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Karimi contre la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MTS Allstream Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Dans cette premi\u00e8re plainte (dossier du Tribunal n\u00b0 T1616\/16210), la plaignante affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi\n[3] Le 1er f\u00e9vrier 2012, la Commission a demand\u00e9 que soit instruite une deuxi\u00e8me plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Karimi contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte (dossier du Tribunal n\u00b0 T1783\/1312), la plaignante affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi et qu\u2019elle a exerc\u00e9 contre elle des repr\u00e9sailles en r\u00e9action \u00e0 sa premi\u00e8re plainte, contrevenant ainsi \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[4] \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion de l\u2019instance tenue le 2 novembre 2012, toutes les parties ont confirm\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate en jonction des deux plaintes devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e au moyen d\u2019observations \u00e9crites.\nII. Positions des parties [5] Apr\u00e8s lecture des observations des parties sur cette requ\u00eate en jonction des deux plaintes, le Tribunal r\u00e9sume ainsi leurs positions respectives.\nA. La plaignante [6] La requ\u00eate de la plaignante en jonction des instances a pour objet de permettre une instruction commune de ses deux plaintes.\n[7] L\u2019avis de requ\u00eate de la plaignante expose les moyens suivants \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate :\n1) Les deux plaintes concernent les m\u00eames parties.\n2) Les deux plaintes renferment des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et un non\u2011respect de l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n3) Dans sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte, elle all\u00e8gue avoir subi des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa premi\u00e8re plainte.\n4) Pour les deux plaintes, les personnes appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sont les m\u00eames et les documents qui seront invoqu\u00e9s sont \u00e9galement les m\u00eames.\n5) La plaignante fera t\u00e9moigner le m\u00eame t\u00e9moin expert, un psychiatre, pour les deux plaintes.\n6) Les deux plaintes soul\u00e8vent les m\u00eames points de droit.\n7) Aucune des parties ne subira un pr\u00e9judice si les deux plaintes sont instruites ensemble. La jonction des deux plaintes profitera aux deux parties.\n8) Il est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du Tribunal que les deux plaintes soient instruites ensemble, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse du temps requis, des frais ou de l\u2019uniformit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il rendra.\n9) La Loi, en particulier pour ce qui concerne le paragraphe 40(4), ne traite pas explicitement des plaintes multiples d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par un plaignant unique, mais donne \u00e0 penser que, si les questions de fait et de droit sont les m\u00eames, des plaintes peuvent \u00eatre instruites ensemble.\n10) Enfin, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure) ont pour objet notamment, selon le paragraphe 1(1), de permettre que toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites en temps opportun, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re efficace et de la fa\u00e7on la plus rapide possible.\n[8] Les paragraphes 2 \u00e0 4 de l\u2019affidavit de la plaignante d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au soutien de la requ\u00eate d\u00e9crivent les all\u00e9gations contenues dans ses deux plaintes :\n[TRADUCTION]\n2. L\u2019all\u00e9gation principale contenue dans ma premi\u00e8re plainte concerne une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Une all\u00e9gation secondaire concerne une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, ainsi que le non\u2011respect de l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n3. En ce qui concerne la d\u00e9ficience, j\u2019all\u00e8gue dans ma premi\u00e8re plainte avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 surcharg\u00e9e de t\u00e2ches que je n\u2019avais pas la capacit\u00e9 physique d\u2019accomplir apr\u00e8s \u00eatre revenue d\u2019un cong\u00e9 pour invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e. J\u2019all\u00e8gue aussi dans ma premi\u00e8re plainte que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 son obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation lorsqu\u2019il ne m\u2019a pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 travailler depuis mon domicile alors que d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 le faire.\n4. La premi\u00e8re all\u00e9gation contenue dans ma deuxi\u00e8me plainte concerne une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience et un non\u2011respect de l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation. J\u2019all\u00e8gue subsidiairement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre moi apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ma premi\u00e8re plainte.\n[9] Les paragraphes suivants de l\u2019affidavit de la plaignante r\u00e9sument les raisons pour lesquelles elle voudrait que ses deux plaintes soient instruites ensemble :\n[TRADUCTION]\nT\u00e9moins semblables\n6. Puisque les deux plaintes concernent les m\u00eames parties, \u00e0 savoir moi\u2011m\u00eame et MTS Allstream Inc., il est probable que les m\u00eames personnes seront appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner aux deux audiences si les deux plaintes sont instruites s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. \u00c0 l\u2019origine, deux personnes \u00e9taient indiqu\u00e9es comme intim\u00e9es dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, mais elles ne sont plus parties \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte.\nDocuments semblables\n7. Les documents invoqu\u00e9s dans les deux plaintes seront semblables et comprennent pour l\u2019essentiel les m\u00eames \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de politique de MTS Allstream, la convention collective applicable, les documents m\u00e9dicaux et les documents en mati\u00e8re de perte de salaire.\nM\u00eame t\u00e9moin expert\n8. Si les plaintes sont instruites s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, mon t\u00e9moin expert, le Dr Kiraly, sera appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 deux reprises, ce qui augmentera mes frais et lui causera davantage d\u2019inconv\u00e9nients. Est annex\u00e9e au pr\u00e9sent affidavit, sous la cote \u00ab A \u00bb, une copie du rapport d\u2019expert du Dr Kiraly. Le Dr Kiraly, un psychiatre, t\u00e9moignera sur la mesure dans laquelle la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans ma premi\u00e8re plainte, a pu pr\u00e9cipiter l\u2019apparition de mes probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale, notamment la d\u00e9pression, dont il est question dans ma deuxi\u00e8me plainte.\nQuestions de droit semblables\n9. Dans ma premi\u00e8re plainte, comme dans la deuxi\u00e8me, j\u2019all\u00e8gue une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, de m\u00eame qu\u2019un non\u2011respect de l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent tout au long des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es dans les deux plaintes. J\u2019all\u00e8gue aussi dans ma deuxi\u00e8me plainte que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 mon endroit \u00e0 la suite de ma premi\u00e8re plainte. Il me semble que ces questions de droit, qui sont apparent\u00e9es, devraient \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es ensemble.\nAbsence de pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n10. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si les plaintes sont instruites ensemble. L\u2019instruction simultan\u00e9e des deux plaintes aura en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 pour effet de r\u00e9duire la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction en \u00e9vitant la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition inutile d\u2019informations, et de r\u00e9duire les inconv\u00e9nients pour les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n11. Par l\u2019entremise de mon avocat, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 MTS Allstream Inc. de consentir \u00e0 la jonction des deux plaintes, mais MTS Allstream Inc. a refus\u00e9, d\u2019o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nIl vaut mieux pour le Tribunal qu\u2019il instruise simultan\u00e9ment les deux plaintes\n12. L\u2019instruction simultan\u00e9e des deux plaintes \u00e9pargnera temps et argent au Tribunal en r\u00e9duisant la dur\u00e9e totale de l\u2019instruction.\n13. Le Tribunal devrait, simultan\u00e9ment pour les deux plaintes, analyser la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience ainsi que le non\u2011respect de l\u2019obligation de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation, et aussi analyser les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 que soul\u00e8vent les deux plaintes, ce qui \u00e9vitera le risque de conclusions incompatibles.\nB. L\u2019intim\u00e9e [10] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant la requ\u00eate de la plaignante est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au premier paragraphe des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e :\n[TRADUCTION]\n1. L\u2019intim\u00e9e MTS Allstream Inc. (\u00ab Allstream \u00bb) s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante en jonction des dossiers du Tribunal nos T1783\/1312 (la \u00ab premi\u00e8re plainte \u00bb) et T1616\/16210 (la \u00ab deuxi\u00e8me plainte \u00bb) (ci\u2011apr\u00e8s appel\u00e9es collectivement \u00ab les plaintes \u00bb) en vue d\u2019une instruction simultan\u00e9e des deux plaintes. Allstream affirme respectueusement que la requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[11] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est expos\u00e9e pour l\u2019essentiel dans le passage suivant du paragraphe 4 de ses observations :\n[TRADUCTION]\n4. [...] Les plaintes se rapportent toutes les deux \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la plaignante chez Allstream, mais elles ne concernent pas les m\u00eames p\u00e9riodes ni les m\u00eames motifs de distinction, et elles comportent des all\u00e9gations portant sur des personnes diff\u00e9rentes.\n[12] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la liste qui suit reproduit ce qui me semble \u00eatre les principales objections de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la jonction des deux plaintes :\n\u2022 Dans la premi\u00e8re plainte, la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe \u00e9tait l\u2019unique motif de distinction all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 5).\n\u2022 La premi\u00e8re plainte faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la plaignante, mais la plaignante n\u2019y affirmait pas qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination ou qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en raison de cette d\u00e9ficience all\u00e9gu\u00e9e (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 5).\n\u2022 Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur un autre motif, y compris la d\u00e9ficience, en ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re plainte (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 6).\n\u2022 La discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans les deux plaintes ne porte pas sur les m\u00eames p\u00e9riodes et ne concerne pas les m\u00eames personnes. Plus exactement, la premi\u00e8re plainte renferme des all\u00e9gations \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Picard pour la p\u00e9riode allant de mars 2005 \u00e0 octobre 2008. M. Picard n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte. La deuxi\u00e8me plainte renferme des all\u00e9gations \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Rooney pour la p\u00e9riode allant d\u2019octobre 2008 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2010. M. Rooney n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9 dans la premi\u00e8re plainte (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 7 et 8).\n\u2022 Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de joindre les deux plaintes pour d\u00e9cider si des repr\u00e9sailles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 9).\n\u2022 Les parties devront faire t\u00e9moigner des t\u00e9moins diff\u00e9rents et pr\u00e9senter des preuves documentaires diff\u00e9rentes pour chaque plainte, mais, comme il y a des diff\u00e9rences notables entre les all\u00e9gations contenues dans les deux plaintes, la plupart des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui seront produits seront diff\u00e9rents (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 10).\n\u2022 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [E]u \u00e9gard aux all\u00e9gations totalement diff\u00e9rentes qui sont faites dans chacune des plaintes, il n\u2019y a aucun risque d\u2019incompatibilit\u00e9 des conclusions \u00bb (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 11).\n\u2022 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab La jonction des plaintes n\u2019\u00e9pargnera ni temps ni argent aux parties \u00bb (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 13).\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la jonction des deux plaintes lui causera un pr\u00e9judice. Les points suivants constituent ce qui m\u2019appara\u00eet \u00eatre les principaux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard :\n\u2022 Puisque la premi\u00e8re plainte fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe uniquement, la jonction des deux plaintes \u00e9largirait les motifs de la premi\u00e8re plainte pour y inclure des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, aux paragraphes 16 \u00e0 18).\n\u2022 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence, quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re plainte, pour examiner une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience \u00bb (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 17).\n\u2022 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab [S]i la plaignante est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9largir les motifs de la premi\u00e8re plainte [\u2026] Allstream se verra injustement oblig\u00e9e de contester de nouvelles all\u00e9gations qui remontent \u00e0 plus de cinq ans \u00bb (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 19).\n\u2022 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Si les plaintes sont instruites ensemble, Allstream affirme respectueusement que d\u2019importantes protections proc\u00e9durales seront n\u00e9cessaires pour faire en sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019existe entre les plaintes aucune confusion pouvant porter pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 Allstream \u00bb (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 20).\n\u2022 [TRADUCTION] \u00ab Outre qu\u2019elles devront faire t\u00e9moigner des t\u00e9moins distincts et produire des preuves documentaires distinctes pour chacune des plaintes, les parties devront probablement pr\u00e9senter des arguments distincts pour chaque plainte. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, cela aura probablement pour effet de prolonger sensiblement la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction et de peser davantage sur les ressources restreintes du Tribunal \u00bb (voir les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au paragraphe 20).\nC. La Commission [14] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 10 septembre 2012, la Commission a r\u00e9pondu ainsi \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en jonction des plaintes aux fins d\u2019instruction :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa Commission ne prend pas position sur la requ\u00eate sollicitant une instruction commune des deux plaintes dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Cependant, en principe, si les deux plaintes concernent les m\u00eames parties, et si les faits pr\u00e9sentent une certaine similitude dans la relation d\u2019emploi, il peut \u00eatre dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice que les deux plaintes soient instruites ensemble devant le m\u00eame membre instructeur.\nCela dit, les parties peuvent avancer les arguments de fait et de droit propres \u00e0 justifier leurs positions respectives, et le Tribunal peut rendre la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il juge \u00e0 propos de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice.\nNous portons \u00e0 l\u2019attention des parties l\u2019affaire suivante concernant cette question : Karen Schuyler c. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 TCDP 10 (CanLII). Le membre Hadjis a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit, au paragraphe 8 de sa d\u00e9cision :\n[8] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu \u00e0 d\u00e9cider s\u2019il devait autoriser la modification d\u2019une plainte existante de discrimination afin d\u2019ajouter une plainte d\u2019exercice de repr\u00e9sailles d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 (voir p. ex., Kavanagh c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (31 mai 1999), T505\/2298 (T.C.D.P.); Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle Point et de Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2 (CanLII); Blondin c. Courrier Purolator Lt\u00e9., 2005 TCDP 7 (CanLII)). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 dans ces d\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il est logique que la preuve relative \u00e0 des actes commis en repr\u00e9sailles du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soit entendue dans le contexte de l\u2019audience de cette m\u00eame plainte. Toutefois, avant d\u2019autoriser de telles modifications, le Tribunal doit \u00eatre convaincu que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice en raison d\u2019un avis insuffisant quant aux nouvelles all\u00e9gations. L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit avoir l\u2019occasion de se d\u00e9fendre d\u2019une mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate.\n[15] Dans une autre correspondance adress\u00e9e aux parties et au Tribunal, en date du 1er octobre 2012, la Commission a joint une copie de la d\u00e9cision Anne Marsden c. Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada et Service administratif des tribunaux judiciaires, 2012 TCDP 21. La Commission explique ainsi la pertinence de cette d\u00e9cision :\n[TRADUCTION]\nPuisque la question de la jonction des plaintes est une question r\u00e9elle entre les parties, j\u2019annexe une d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente du Tribunal qui porte sur une question semblable et qui pourrait \u00eatre instructive.\nIII. Analyse [16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lattey c. Compagnie de chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique, 2002 CanLII 45928 (TCDP), le Tribunal a fait observer que la question de savoir s\u2019il convient d\u2019instruire des plaintes ensemble ou s\u00e9par\u00e9ment est, en l\u2019absence de directives pr\u00e9cises dans la loi, un point de proc\u00e9dure que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de trancher puisqu\u2019il a le loisir de d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre (voir la d\u00e9cision Lattey, au paragraphe 12; et la d\u00e9cision Cruden c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada, et la d\u00e9cision Wheatcroft c. Agence canadienne de d\u00e9veloppement international, 2010 TCDP 32, aux paragraphes 10 et 11). Lorsqu\u2019il statue sur des demandes de jonction de plaintes, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re notamment les facteurs suivants :\nL\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu\u2019il y a \u00e0 \u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures, y compris la r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts, des d\u00e9lais, des inconv\u00e9nients pour les t\u00e9moins, du besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la preuve et du risque de parvenir \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats contradictoires;\n2. Le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait causer aux intim\u00e9s une instruction commune, notamment en raison du prolongement de la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience pour chaque intim\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner des questions propres \u00e0 l\u2019autre intim\u00e9, ainsi que du risque de confusion que pourrait engendrer la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ayant peut\u2011\u00eatre pas rapport aux all\u00e9gations mettant en cause particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre intim\u00e9; et\n3. L\u2019existence de questions de fait ou de droit communes.\n(D\u00e9cision Lattey, au paragraphe 12)\nEn derni\u00e8re analyse, le Tribunal doit s\u2019assurer que l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (voir le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi; et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104)).\n[17] Bon nombre des objections de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la jonction des deux plaintes s\u2019expliquent par la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e interpr\u00e8te le formulaire de la premi\u00e8re plainte. Se fondant sur ce formulaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a conclu que l\u2019instruction de la premi\u00e8re plainte devrait se limiter \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence, quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re plainte, pour examiner les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019elle sera notablement entrav\u00e9e dans sa capacit\u00e9 de se d\u00e9fendre contre de nouvelles all\u00e9gations qu\u2019on laisserait se glisser dans la premi\u00e8re plainte.\n[18] Cependant, ayant analys\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, je suis d\u2019avis que le fait de s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 l\u2019examen du formulaire de la premi\u00e8re plainte donne un portrait incomplet de la situation. Outre les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, le Tribunal dispose aussi des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions produits par les parties concernant la premi\u00e8re plainte. Dans les documents annex\u00e9s \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate, et dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions portant sur la premi\u00e8re plainte, la plaignante explique la port\u00e9e de sa premi\u00e8re plainte en disant qu\u2019elle comporte une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Sur ce point, les observations suivantes formul\u00e9es par le Tribunal dans une autre affaire sont instructives :\nLe formulaire de plainte existe principalement pour les besoins de la Commission. Il est une premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n\u00e9cessaire qui soul\u00e8ve une s\u00e9rie de faits qui requi\u00e8rent une enqu\u00eate plus \u00e0 fond. Le formulaire de plainte fournit un point de d\u00e9part important et il est approximatif en soi. Il n\u2019a jamais eu pour but de servir aux fins d\u2019une plaidoirie dans un processus adjudicatif qui m\u00e8ne \u00e0 une audience. Ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, plut\u00f4t que la plainte initiale, qui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019audience.\n[...]\nDans la mesure o\u00f9 elles peuvent se retrouver dans les all\u00e9gations et les faits soumis \u00e0 la Commission et o\u00f9 elles ne portent pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les modifications devraient \u00eatre autoris\u00e9es. Cela aide toutes les parties \u00e0 \u00ab d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb.\n(Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 10 et 13, non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original)\n[19] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate ne vise pas \u00e0 modifier la premi\u00e8re plainte ni, inversement, \u00e0 radier des passages de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante se rapportant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re plainte. Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire au Tribunal de dire si une all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience fait d\u00fbment partie de la premi\u00e8re plainte.\n[20] Que les deux plaintes soient instruites s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ou ensemble, les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante resteront les m\u00eames. Quant aux inqui\u00e9tudes de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 pour elle de se d\u00e9fendre contre de \u00ab nouvelles all\u00e9gations \u00bb de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience, elles pourront \u00eatre dissip\u00e9es gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9change d\u2019expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions se rapportant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me plainte. \u00c0 ce stade, l\u2019intim\u00e9e sera en mesure de r\u00e9agir, avant l\u2019instruction, \u00e0 la fusion apparente des faits et des questions pour la premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me plaintes et de s\u2019y opposer. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 ci\u2011dessus, ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions de chacune des parties qui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019instruction. Je n\u2019accepte donc pas l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lequel la jonction des deux plaintes lui causera un pr\u00e9judice par suite de la fusion des faits et des questions propres \u00e0 chacune des deux plaintes.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait aussi valoir que les questions de fait et de droit ne sont pas suffisamment semblables pour justifier une jonction des plaintes. Selon elle, les deux plaintes se rapportent \u00e0 des p\u00e9riodes diff\u00e9rentes et renferment des all\u00e9gations qui concernent des personnes diff\u00e9rentes. Elle ajoute que, puisque la plaignante all\u00e8gue diff\u00e9rents types de discriminations, les crit\u00e8res juridiques \u00e0 appliquer varieront.\n[22] \u00c0 mon avis, il y a dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire des questions communes de fait et de droit et j\u2019examinerai successivement chacun des arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en la mati\u00e8re.\n[23] D\u2019abord, m\u00eame si les deux plaintes se rapportent \u00e0 des p\u00e9riodes diff\u00e9rentes, il s\u2019agit de p\u00e9riodes continues. Sur cet aspect, j\u2019ajouterais que la deuxi\u00e8me plainte fait \u00e9tat de repr\u00e9sailles qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte. Puisque les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles couvrent la p\u00e9riode post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la premi\u00e8re plainte, \u00ab il est logique que la preuve relative \u00e0 des actes commis en repr\u00e9sailles du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soit entendue dans le contexte de l\u2019audience de cette m\u00eame plainte \u00bb (d\u00e9cision Karen Schuyler c. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 8).\n[24] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que, puisque les protagonistes \u00e0 l\u2019origine des deux plaintes ne sont pas les m\u00eames (voir les paragraphes 7 et 8 des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e), il n\u2019y a pas v\u00e9ritablement de similitude dans les questions de fait soulev\u00e9es par les deux plaintes. Je voudrais faire observer que cela n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait exact \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Jennifer Bazinet, qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 un certain moment la directrice de la plaignante, est mentionn\u00e9e dans les deux plaintes. Selon la plaignante, Mme Bazinet est intervenue dans certains des incidents qui sont mentionn\u00e9s dans les deux plaintes. Sont reproduits ci\u2011apr\u00e8s quelques extraits des all\u00e9gations de la plaignante apparaissant dans chacune de ses plaintes, extraits o\u00f9 appara\u00eet le nom de Jennifer Bazinet :\n[TRADUCTION]\nFormulaire de plainte n\u00b0 1 (\u00e0 la page 4, paragraphe 3) :\nLe 4 f\u00e9vrier 2008, la demande que j\u2019avais faite en vue de suivre un cours de gestion de projet a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la directrice, Jennifer Bazinet, dans mon nouveau service. La directrice m\u2019a inform\u00e9e que le cours [TRADUCTION] \u00ab ne s\u2019accordait pas avec [mes] comp\u00e9tences ni avec [mon] d\u00e9veloppement \u00bb.\nFormulaire de plainte n\u00b0 1 (\u00e0 la page 4, paragraphe 5) :\nLe 5 mars 2008, Jennifer Bazinet et les Ressources humaines ont convoqu\u00e9 une r\u00e9union \u00e0 mon intention [...], au cours de la r\u00e9union on m\u2019a fait savoir que je devrais changer d\u2019attitude.\nFormulaire de plainte n\u00b0 2 (au paragraphe 10) :\nLe 26 octobre 2009, Jennifer Bazinet, la sup\u00e9rieure imm\u00e9diate de Mme Karimi, a dit \u00e0 celle\u2011ci qu\u2019il lui faudrait retourner au travail \u00e0 plein temps la semaine suivante.\nFormulaire de plainte n\u00b0 2 (au paragraphe 12) :\nLe 19 novembre 2009, Mme Karimi a rencontr\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants de MTS, dont Mme Bazinet [...]. Mme Karimi s\u2019est fait dire que MTS ne la laisserait plus travailler trois jours par semaine comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas depuis le 31 mars 2009. En d\u00e9pit de la note du Dr Malkin dat\u00e9e du 22 octobre 2009 confirmant que Mme Karimi ne pouvait pas retourner au travail \u00e0 temps plein [...]\nFormulaire de plainte n\u00b0 2 (au paragraphe 22) :\nMme Karimi affirme que MTS doit r\u00e9pondre de toutes les mesures prises par M. Rooney. [...] M. Rooney est \u00e0 l\u2019origine des actes discriminatoires pos\u00e9s par Bazinet, Stammer et Van Horne.\n[25] Cela dit, globalement, il n\u2019est pas pertinent, selon moi, que la premi\u00e8re plainte renferme des all\u00e9gations concernant des personnes diff\u00e9rentes de celles mentionn\u00e9es dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte. MTS Allstream Inc. est l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans les deux plaintes, et les personnes d\u00e9sign\u00e9es dans chacune des plaintes sont ses employ\u00e9s. La plaignante explique dans ses deux plaintes la mani\u00e8re dont chacune d\u2019elles, \u00e0 divers moments, a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s. Le fait d\u2019entendre ces personnes s\u2019exprimer au cours d\u2019une seule instruction faciliterait l\u2019examen et la compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019\u00e9volution de la situation dans laquelle se trouvait la plaignante.\n[26] Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que les deux plaintes renferment des all\u00e9gations portant sur plusieurs types de discrimination, qui requi\u00e8rent l\u2019application de crit\u00e8res juridiques diff\u00e9rents. Cependant, les deux plaintes renferment des all\u00e9gations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi. La deuxi\u00e8me plainte renferme aussi une all\u00e9gation au titre de l\u2019article 14.1, mais elle ne modifie pas le crit\u00e8re juridique ni le fardeau de la preuve qui incombe \u00e0 la plaignante dans les deux plaintes : elle doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve prima facie. Plus exactement, dans les deux plaintes, la plaignante doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve \u00ab [\u2026] qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 [\u2026] \u00bb (arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons\u2011Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au paragraphe 28).\n[27] Finalement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u2019avis qu\u2019une seule instruction n\u2019apportera aucun gain d\u2019efficacit\u00e9. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle soutient qu\u2019il en r\u00e9sultera plut\u00f4t longueur et complexit\u00e9 parce que les t\u00e9moins ne seront pas les m\u00eames, que la preuve documentaire ne sera pas la m\u00eame et que les arguments juridiques qui seront avanc\u00e9s pour chaque plainte ne seront pas non plus les m\u00eames.\n[28] Je suis d\u2019avis que la tenue d\u2019une seule instruction portant sur les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans les deux plaintes \u00e9pargnerait temps et argent aux deux parties, \u00e0 certains des t\u00e9moins et au Tribunal \u00e9galement. Aucun des t\u00e9moins ne serait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner deux fois. Tel serait le cas pour au moins les t\u00e9moins potentiels suivants : la plaignante, l\u2019expert de la plaignante, le Dr Malkin, et Mme Jennifer Bazinet. Par ailleurs, le temps r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux observations liminaires et aux conclusions finales ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019argumentation serait r\u00e9duit. Globalement, je crois qu\u2019une instruction unique pour les deux plaintes permettrait d\u2019\u00e9pargner du temps, et les deux plaintes pourraient d\u00e8s lors \u00eatre examin\u00e9es d\u2019une mani\u00e8re plus exp\u00e9ditive ainsi que le requi\u00e8rent le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03\u201105\u201104).\n[29] J\u2019arrive donc \u00e0 la conclusion que certaines des questions de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9es sont les m\u00eames dans les deux plaintes. Leur jonction aurait pour effet d\u2019abr\u00e9ger le temps requis pour l\u2019instruction et ne causera aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Je suis donc d\u2019avis qu\u2019une instruction unique portant sur les deux plaintes est justifi\u00e9e. Cependant, si je suis arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que les deux plaintes devraient \u00eatre examin\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une seule instruction, cela ne veut pas dire que l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre d\u2019entre elles est fond\u00e9e, en fait ou en droit.\nIV. D\u00e9cision [30] Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate de la plaignante en jonction de ses deux plaintes est accueillie. Le Tribunal instruira simultan\u00e9ment les deux plaintes.\nSign\u00e9e par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nMembre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 7 f\u00e9vrier 2013",

Le contexte [1] Le plaignant est abonn\u00e9 aux services vid\u00e9o offerts par l\u2019intim\u00e9e ; il se fie au son en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. Le 2 mai 2012, le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), all\u00e9guant que le plaignant avait commis \u00e0 son endroit un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience dans le contexte de la fourniture d\u2019un service, en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c H-6 (la Loi). Le plaignant a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne lui a pas offert les accommodements qui lui \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, soit un service de vid\u00e9odescription (DVS), un moyen d\u2019activer et de d\u00e9sactiver le DVS facilement, et finalement, du mat\u00e9riel et des logiciels fournissant des descriptions sonores des menus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cran. Le Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications canadiennes (le CRTC) a depuis tranch\u00e9 les deux premi\u00e8res questions. La plainte en suspens du plaignant, que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 8 mai 2012, a trait au fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de fournir du mat\u00e9riel et des logiciels offrant des descriptions sonores des menus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cran. Le plaignant soutient que la technologie permettant d\u2019offrir un tel service est disponible. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que cette technologie n\u2019est pas disponible \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle et que son d\u00e9veloppement est tributaire de fabricants tiers.\n[2] Le 17 d\u00e9cembre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal un avis de requ\u00eate afin d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9, en vue de pr\u00e9server la nature confidentielle de documents contenant des renseignements d\u2019ordre priv\u00e9 et des renseignements commerciaux ainsi que des renseignements techniques exclusifs non accessibles au public. Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le Tribunal a tenu une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de laquelle les parties ont discut\u00e9 de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal a enjoint aux parties de se concerter en vue de r\u00e9diger une entente de confidentialit\u00e9 que le Tribunal pourrait alors ent\u00e9riner.\n[3] Le 16 janvier 2013, le Tribunal a tenu une autre t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion de cas, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de laquelle les parties ont fait part de leurs positions relativement \u00e0 une \u00e9bauche d\u2019entente de confidentialit\u00e9. Le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient tous deux dispos\u00e9s \u00e0 signer l\u2019entente r\u00e9vis\u00e9e, mais la Commission s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9e. Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail ci\u2011dessous, vu que les parties n\u2019ont pas pu parvenir \u00e0 une entente, le Tribunal est \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent dans l\u2019obligation de se prononcer sur la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nII. Les positions des parties [4] Dans sa requ\u00eate dat\u00e9e du 17 d\u00e9cembre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les renseignements \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre MTS, les fournisseurs de logiciels de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision par IP (IPTV) et les vendeurs de mat\u00e9riel, qui ont conduit \u00e0 la fourniture du service Ultimate TV auquel le plaignant est abonn\u00e9, sont confidentiels et font l\u2019objet d\u2019une clause de confidentialit\u00e9. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir que nombre des autres r\u00e9ponses qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ues d\u2019autres fournisseurs et vendeurs dans le contexte de ce processus contenaient des renseignements d\u2019ordre priv\u00e9, des renseignements financiers et des renseignements techniques exclusifs, lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis \u00e0 MTS sous l\u2019\u00e9gide d\u2019une entente de confidentialit\u00e9. La requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9server la nature confidentielle de ces renseignements.\n[5] Initialement, le plaignant ne souscrivait pas aux conditions de l\u2019ordonnance propos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s que les parties se sont efforc\u00e9es de modifier les conditions de l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019une mani\u00e8re jug\u00e9e acceptable pour tous, le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont parvenus \u00e0 l\u2019entente suivante\n[Traduction]\n1. Le plaignant, la Commission et toute partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, ainsi que leurs avocats, sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s s\u2019engager \u00e0 ne pas utiliser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou les renseignements communiqu\u00e9s dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instance \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins que celles de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n2. Sous r\u00e9serve des dispositions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e devra pr\u00e9senter aux avocats du plaignant et de la Commission les documents auxquels il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la liste de documents r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sous les num\u00e9ros 3,1, tous les documents figurant sous les en-t\u00eates 3,2, 3,4, 3,5, 3,6 et 4,1 (ci-dessous appel\u00e9s les \u00ab documents confidentiels \u00bb). Le Tribunal peut exiger la communication de ces m\u00eames documents \u00e0 toute partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, ce qui devra \u00eatre \u00e9tabli au moment d\u2019ajouter ces parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es.\n3. Le plaignant, la Commission et toute partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, ainsi que leurs avocats, informeront tous les t\u00e9moins ainsi que toutes les personnes \u00e0 qui les documents confidentiels seront communiqu\u00e9s pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente instance des conditions de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, et l\u2019engagement r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 pris s\u2019appliquera \u00e0 ces t\u00e9moins ou \u00e0 ces autres personnes.\n4. Si l\u2019une des parties, leurs avocats ou leurs t\u00e9moins souhaitent nommer les tiers ou faire allusion aux renseignements exclusifs ou aux renseignements financiers auxquels il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans les documents confidentiels au cours d\u2019une audience dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, ils devront pr\u00e9alablement en aviser le Tribunal, et la partie de l\u2019audience au cours de laquelle ces renseignements seront mentionn\u00e9s ou feront l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bats se tiendra \u00e0 huis clos.\n5. Les renseignements suivants ne sont pas vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance :\na. les renseignements qui se trouvaient l\u00e9gitimement et sans restriction l\u00e9gale entre les mains du plaignant ou de la Commission avant la date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ;\nb. les renseignements obtenus ind\u00e9pendamment de la divulgation dont il est questions dans la pr\u00e9sente instance ;\nc. les renseignements obtenus l\u00e9gitimement d\u2019une personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 les communiquer ;\nd. les renseignements qui sont rendus accessibles au public autrement que par suite de la violation de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n6. Tout document confidentiel qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instance, ou toute copie de ces documents qui aura \u00e9t\u00e9 faite ou utilis\u00e9e par les parties, leurs avocats ou leurs t\u00e9moins dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente instance, sera d\u00e9truit ou restitu\u00e9 aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e au terme de l\u2019audience.\n7. La conclusion de la pr\u00e9sente instance ne lib\u00e9rera pas les personnes auxquelles les documents confidentiels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s en application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance des obligations qui leur incombent aux termes de cette m\u00eame ordonnance.\n8. Au cas o\u00f9 des questions se poseraient ou des diff\u00e9rends surviendraient relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, les parties pourront pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal de nouvelles observations.\n[6] La Commission ne souscrit pas \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant ont propos\u00e9e pour un certain nombre de raisons. La Commission soutient qu\u2019il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 un engagement en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 implicite, selon lequel les parties ne doivent pas divulguer des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire devant le Tribunal, et qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 de cette nature est par cons\u00e9quent inutile. La Commission remet tout particuli\u00e8rement en cause l\u2019article 4 de l\u2019ordonnance, qui pr\u00e9voit les cas dans lesquels des parties de l\u2019audience se tiendraient \u00e0 huis clos. La Commission soutient que l\u2019article 52 de la Loi \u00e9nonce les exceptions \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle les instructions du Tribunal doivent \u00eatre publiques et qu\u2019il convient mieux d\u2019aborder la question de ces exceptions au cours de l\u2019audience qu\u2019avant celle-ci, dans une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9. La Commission fait \u00e9galement valoir que la destruction de la preuve documentaire au terme de l\u2019audience, telle que la pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 6 de l\u2019ordonnance, pose probl\u00e8me \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas de la proc\u00e9dure habituelle. Dans l\u2019ensemble, la Commission a fait savoir qu\u2019elle ne comprend pas pourquoi une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 de cette nature serait n\u00e9cessaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, par comparaison avec les autres affaires port\u00e9es devant le Tribunal, et elle s\u2019inqui\u00e8te de voir cr\u00e9er un tel pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nIII. L\u2019analyse et la d\u00e9cision [7] Pendant la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence du 16 janvier 2013, les parties ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance sur consentement fond\u00e9e sur le projet d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 sur lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9e et le plaignant se sont entendus. Le paragraphe 18 des motifs prononc\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Uppal c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), [1987] 3 C.F. 565, r\u00e9sume clairement la port\u00e9e et l\u2019objectif d\u2019un jugement sur consentement :\nUn jugement sur consentement ne fait pas jurisprudence. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, le tribunal qui ratifie un tel jugement ne se soucie que de deux choses : la capacit\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 consentir au jugement et la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal de rendre l\u2019ordonnance recherch\u00e9e. Un jugement sur consentement ne refl\u00e8te ni des conclusions de fait ni l\u2019application m\u00fbrement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chie du droit applicable aux faits. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente pour la Cour d\u2019exercer son pouvoir fondamental de r\u00e9gler des diff\u00e9rends, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle intervient en ratifiant un accord survenu entre des parties capables de s\u2019engager plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en parvenant elle-m\u00eame \u00e0 une conclusion.\n[8] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9e se sont entendus sur l\u2019\u00e9bauche d\u2019entente propos\u00e9e, mais la Commission n\u2019y a pas souscrit. L\u2019article 51 de la Loi circonscrit le r\u00f4le de la Commission dans les affaires entendues devant le Tribunal.\n51. En comparaissant devant le membre instructeur et en pr\u00e9sentant ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et ses observations, la Commission adopte l\u2019attitude la plus proche, \u00e0 son avis, de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, compte tenu de la nature de la plainte.\n[9] M\u00eame si l\u2019article ne le pr\u00e9voit pas explicitement, la Commission est indubitablement \u00ab partie \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure \u00bb. C\u2019est la conclusion que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a express\u00e9ment tir\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (Section locale 70396), 2006 CF 703, aux paragraphes 29, 51 et 55. Vu l\u2019opposition de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019entente propos\u00e9e par les parties, il est impossible d\u2019affirmer que cette entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue avec le consentement de toutes les parties. Dans les circonstances, il est par cons\u00e9quent impossible pour le Tribunal de rendre une ordonnance sur consentement.\n[10] En vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir de rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction. L\u2019article 52 est ainsi libell\u00e9\n52(1) L\u2019instruction est publique, mais le membre instructeur peut, sur demande en ce sens, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019il est convaincu que, selon le cas\na) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique ;\nb) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique ;\nc) il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique ;\nd) il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.\n(2) Le membre instructeur peut, s\u2019il l\u2019estime indiqu\u00e9, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de la demande vis\u00e9e au paragraphe (1).\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, dans le contexte d\u2019une affaire traitant essentiellement de la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une technique exclusive ne relevant pas du domaine public, un grand nombre des documents susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une communication contiennent des renseignements de nature commerciale confidentiels, priv\u00e9s et sensibles. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme \u00eatre elle-m\u00eame li\u00e9e par un certain nombre d\u2019engagements en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 relatifs \u00e0 ces renseignements \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de tiers. Si ces renseignements devaient \u00eatre rendus publics au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance, il s\u2019agirait d\u2019une violation de ces engagements et l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait voir sa responsabilit\u00e9 engag\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ces tiers. En me fondant sur le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que je comprends, l\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la communication des renseignements en cause l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\n[12] Je comprends la position de la Commission, selon laquelle le Tribunal est mieux plac\u00e9 pour trancher ces questions de confidentialit\u00e9 au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019elles se pr\u00e9senteront au cours de l\u2019audience, mais je suis d\u2019avis que le fait de circonscrire dans une ordonnance la fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9signer des documents comme confidentiels contribuera \u00e0 la bonne marche de l\u2019instance. Vu que le Tribunal n\u2019a que rarement l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner des affaires dans lesquelles il est question de renseignements exclusifs de nature confidentielle, les R\u00e8gles de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure du Conseil de la radiodiffusion et des t\u00e9l\u00e9communications canadiennes (DORS\/2010-277), le Bulletin d\u2019information de radiodiffusion et de t\u00e9l\u00e9com CRTC 2010-959, Lignes directrices \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des R\u00e8gles de pratique et de proc\u00e9dure du CRTC, et le Bulletin d\u2019information de radiodiffusion et de t\u00e9l\u00e9com CRTC 2010-961, Proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t et la demande de communication de renseignements confidentiels dans le cadre d\u2019une instance du Conseil, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 particuli\u00e8rement utiles \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il est \u00e9galement utile de tenir compte de la jurisprudence du Tribunal relative \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 en vue d\u2019assurer la protection des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir, par exemple, les mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Section locale 500, Richard Wilkinson et Cliff Willicome, 2013 TCDP 1). Apr\u00e8s examen des observations des parties, du projet d\u2019ordonnance, de la jurisprudence du Tribunal et des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du CRTC susmentionn\u00e9es, le Tribunal adopte les lignes directrices suivantes en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9.\n1. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels\n[13] Pour d\u00e9poser des renseignements confidentiels devant le Tribunal, les parties doivent suivre les \u00e9tapes suivantes :\ni. Premi\u00e8rement, la partie qui souhaite d\u00e9poser des renseignements confidentiels doit d\u00e9poser ces renseignements au Tribunal et les d\u00e9signer comme confidentiels ;\nii. Deuxi\u00e8mement, une autre partie ou le Tribunal peut demander la communication de ces renseignements, et la partie qui a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 ces renseignements comme confidentiels peut r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette demande ;\niii. Troisi\u00e8mement, en se fondant sur la demande de communication ainsi que sur la r\u00e9ponse de la partie concern\u00e9e, le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera de communiquer les renseignements ou de demander \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient communiqu\u00e9s.\n[14] Au moment de d\u00e9poser des renseignements au Tribunal, une partie peut les \u00ab d\u00e9signer \u00bb comme confidentiels s\u2019ils font partie d\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories suivantes :\ni. Les renseignements qui rel\u00e8vent du secret commercial ;\nii. Les renseignements financiers, commerciaux, scientifiques ou techniques confidentiels qui sont syst\u00e9matiquement trait\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re confidentielle par la personne qui les a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ;\niii. Les renseignements qui, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient communiqu\u00e9s, pourraient vraisemblablement\n1. \u00eatre source de pertes ou de gains financiers importants pour une personne ;\n2. nuire \u00e0 la position concurrentielle d\u2019une personne ;\n3. influer sur les n\u00e9gociations contractuelles ou de toute autre nature men\u00e9es par une personne.\n[15] Au moment de d\u00e9poser les renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels, la partie concern\u00e9e doit fournir une version abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du document en cause et expliquer pourquoi les renseignements qu\u2019il contient font partie d\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories de renseignements \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-dessus. La partie concern\u00e9e doit fournir une explication d\u00e9taill\u00e9e des raisons pour lesquelles la communication de ces renseignements ne serait pas d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. La version abr\u00e9g\u00e9e du document ainsi que les raisons pour lesquelles les renseignements qu\u2019il contient ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels seront vers\u00e9es au dossier public.\n[16] Les documents qui contiennent des renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels seront d\u00e9pos\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment et seront clairement identifi\u00e9s comme confidentiels. Les documents d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels seront communiqu\u00e9s au plaignant, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 leurs avocats et aux avocats de la Commission, et ils ne seront pas communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes sans l\u2019accord pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal. Toute partie souhaitant d\u00e9battre de documents ou de renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels au cours de l\u2019audience fera part au Tribunal de ses intentions ; le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera alors s\u2019il convient d\u2019exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019article 52 de la Loi et d\u2019entendre les d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations \u00e0 huis clos.\n[17] Les documents confidentiels ne peuvent pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres fins que celles de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Les documents conservent le statut confidentiel que leur accorde le Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que celui-ci en d\u00e9cide autrement, y compris pendant la dur\u00e9e de tout contr\u00f4le judiciaire ou appel de la d\u00e9cision, et apr\u00e8s que le jugement final aura \u00e9t\u00e9 prononc\u00e9.\n[18] Les parties, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la Commission, devront restituer les documents confidentiels \u00e0 la partie qui les a communiqu\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que le jugement final aura \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu, une fois tous les recours judiciaires \u00e9puis\u00e9s. La Commission, en sa qualit\u00e9 d\u2019organisme gouvernemental, se portera garante de la confidentialit\u00e9 des documents conform\u00e9ment aux politiques et aux directives gouvernementales applicables en mati\u00e8re de conservation et de protection des renseignements exclusifs confidentiels. Les documents confidentiels en la possession du Tribunal seront mis sous scell\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la pratique du Tribunal.\n2. La demande de communication de renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels\n[19] Si l\u2019une des parties croit que les renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels devraient \u00eatre rendus publics selon le crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 la communication, il conviendra d\u2019adopter la proc\u00e9dure suivante :\ni. La partie devra pr\u00e9senter sa demande au Tribunal et signifier ses intentions \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9sign\u00e9 les renseignements comme confidentiels. La partie devra exposer dans sa demande les raisons pour lesquelles elle croit que la communication de ces renseignements serait d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\nii. La partie qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les renseignements confidentiels peut d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9ponse au Tribunal dans les 10 jours, en signifiant cette r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 toutes les parties ayant demand\u00e9 la communication des renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels.\n3. La d\u00e9cision de communiquer les renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels\n[20] Le Tribunal peut communiquer des renseignements d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels ou en demander la communication dans l\u2019un des cas suivants :\ni. Les renseignements ne font pas partie d\u2019une des cat\u00e9gories de renseignements susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels;\nii. Les renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 juste titre d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme confidentiels, mais leur communication est d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[21] Dans le cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal a \u00e9tabli que les renseignements devraient \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s, il peut exiger de la partie concern\u00e9e qu\u2019elle en d\u00e9pose une version abr\u00e9g\u00e9e r\u00e9vis\u00e9e du document contenant les renseignements. La partie concern\u00e9e doit d\u00e9poser le document r\u00e9vis\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9lais impartis par le Tribunal.\n[22] Les pr\u00e9sentes lignes directrices ne s\u2019appliquent pas aux renseignements suivants :\ni. les renseignements qui se trouvaient l\u00e9gitimement et sans restriction l\u00e9gale entre les mains du plaignant ou de la Commission avant la date de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance ;\nii. les renseignements obtenus ind\u00e9pendamment de la divulgation dont il est questions dans la pr\u00e9sente instance ;\niii. les renseignements obtenus l\u00e9gitimement d\u2019une personne autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 les communiquer ;\niv. les renseignements qui sont rendus accessibles au public autrement que par suite de la violation de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[23] Le Tribunal se r\u00e9serve le droit de modifier ces lignes directrices si cela s\u2019av\u00e8re n\u00e9cessaire au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\nIV. Les directives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la tenue d\u2019une audience pour la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e relative \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du tribunal [24] Lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence du 16 janvier, le Tribunal a fait savoir aux parties qu\u2019il donnerait des directives relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui a demand\u00e9 la tenue d\u2019une audience pour l\u2019audition de sa requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, par laquelle elle conteste la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Toutefois, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les observations \u00e9crites des parties auront toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal le 8 mars 2013 au plus tard, le Tribunal attendra d\u2019avoir re\u00e7u ces observations \u00e9crites avant de se prononcer sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de tenir une audience.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Entente de r\u00e8glement dans l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel 12\n[1] Le 16 mars 2012, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Harjinder Kaur Rai (la plaignante) \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la GRC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e). La plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et la d\u00e9ficience au sens des articles 7, 10 et 14 de la Loi.\n[2] La d\u00e9cision qui suit a trait \u00e0 une demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sollicitant la communication de documents d\u00e9tenus par la plaignante.\nI. Le contexte [3] Entre autres choses, la plaignante all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les effets du harc\u00e8lement et de la discrimination dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime ou de prendre des mesures pour pr\u00e9venir de tels actes. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle a soulev\u00e9 dans sa plainte la question de sa sant\u00e9 mentale li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression et \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 leurs causes.\n[4] Le 24 janvier 2013, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de lui fournir deux types de documents importants : des documents m\u00e9dicaux et des documents relatifs \u00e0 une action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel li\u00e9e \u00e0 son accident de v\u00e9hicule survenu en 2007.\nII. Les positions des parties A. Documents m\u00e9dicaux depuis le 1er avril 2007 [5] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir subi des actes de harc\u00e8lement, \u00e0 compter de l\u2019an 2000, qui lui ont caus\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend que les documents m\u00e9dicaux transmis et produits par la plaignante remontent \u00e0 2009 seulement.\n[6] L\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite examiner s\u2019il existe d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 ayant min\u00e9 la sant\u00e9 mentale de la plaignante dans les circonstances donnant lieu \u00e0 sa plainte. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le 1er avril 2007, la plaignante a surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 un accident de la route. Elle a pris six semaines de cong\u00e9 pour se r\u00e9tablir de cet accident. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019accident semble marquer le d\u00e9but des probl\u00e8mes physiques et \u00e9motionnels de la plaignante.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les documents que la plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 produits d\u00e9montrent que son diagnostic de douleur chronique li\u00e9 \u00e0 son accident de la route comporte un \u00e9l\u00e9ment psychologique. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le Dr Badii, l\u2019expert m\u00e9dical de la plaignante dans sa demande d\u2019indemnisation de dommages r\u00e9sultant d\u2019un accident de la route survenu en 2008, a indiqu\u00e9 que les difficult\u00e9s de la plaignante \u00e0 se remettre de ses blessures aux tissus mous et du d\u00e9veloppement d\u2019une douleur chronique \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 ses facteurs de risque pr\u00e9existants (sexe f\u00e9minin, ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de stress et de d\u00e9pression). L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le m\u00e9decin avait recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de consulter un [traduction] \u00ab psychiatre ou un psychologue pour d\u00e9terminer si les blessures physiques associ\u00e9es \u00e0 un accident de la route et les sympt\u00f4mes psychiatriques ont eu une incidence d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre sur sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 des situations conflictuelles au travail et, par cons\u00e9quent, s\u2019il y a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur son aptitude \u00e0 retourner au travail d\u2019un point de vue psychiatrique \u00bb.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande \u00e9galement la divulgation des parties du dossier du Dr Bredenkamp, le m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante, qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises dans une version \u00e9pur\u00e9e. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, les parties \u00e9pur\u00e9es comportaient 18 pages vierges, plut\u00f4t que des lignes supprim\u00e9es sur des pages de graphiques. Elle soutient que l\u2019ensemble du dossier du Dr Bredenkamp est pertinent.\n[9] Par souci de pr\u00e9cision, la plaignante soutient qu\u2019elle ne pr\u00e9tend pas ne pas avoir souffert de probl\u00e8mes psychologiques avant 2008. Elle affirme plut\u00f4t ne pas avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre trait\u00e9e pour des probl\u00e8mes psychologiques avant 2008. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle affirme avoir communiqu\u00e9 les dossiers des Drs Sanders et Babbage, psychiatres, et de M. Flamer, psychologue. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a aussi demand\u00e9 les dossiers de M. Ratheberger, psychologue, mais la plaignante soutient avoir d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 des efforts afin d\u2019obtenir ces dossiers aupr\u00e8s de ce dernier, qui a affirm\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la plaignante que ces dossiers n\u2019existent pas. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 les dossiers de M. Nemetz, psychologue. Toutefois, la plaignante ne se souvient pas avoir consult\u00e9 ce psychologue et n\u2019a aucun dossier de celui-ci en sa possession.\n[10] En ce qui concerne son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019accident de la route survenu en 2008, la plaignante affirme avoir divulgu\u00e9 les parties du dossier m\u00e9dical de son m\u00e9decin de famille qui avaient trait aux blessures des tissus mous et \u00e0 la douleur chronique qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident. Elle pr\u00e9tend aussi avoir communiqu\u00e9 les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux ou l\u2019opinion des fournisseurs de soins qui avaient pris des notes au sujet de sa sant\u00e9 mentale, qu\u2019elle avait en sa possession.\n[11] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a omis de justifier pourquoi elle exige des documents m\u00e9dicaux concernant d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante. En outre, elle affirme que rien n\u2019indique dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des parties qu\u2019une preuve m\u00e9dicale ant\u00e9rieure au 25 octobre 2008 est pertinente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Selon la plaignante, ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux qui est en litige, mais seulement ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression et \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et \u00e0 leurs causes. Elle pr\u00e9tend que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a omis de justifier sa demande de documents ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 l\u2019accident de la route; cette derni\u00e8re a simplement affirm\u00e9 que la date [traduction] \u00ab semble marquer le d\u00e9but des probl\u00e8mes physiques et \u00e9motionnels de la caporale Rai \u00bb.\n[12] La Commission convient que la d\u00e9pression et l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 de la plaignante sont en cause dans cette affaire et, \u00e0 ce titre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a droit \u00e0 tous les documents pertinents relatifs \u00e0 ces questions. Cela dit, elle ajoute que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a droit qu\u2019aux documents li\u00e9s aux probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 en cause et non \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de la plaignante.\nB. Dossiers des psychiatres et psychologues \u00e9pur\u00e9s [13] La plaignante a produit des copies \u00e9pur\u00e9es des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux des Drs Sanders et Babbage et de M. Flamer, ses psychiatres et psychologues; et les a communiqu\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. De l\u2019avis de cette derni\u00e8re, comme la plaignante a mis sa sant\u00e9 mentale en cause dans sa plainte, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a droit \u00e0 tous les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de ces professionnels de la sant\u00e9.\n[14] La plaignante fait valoir que pendant le traitement et dans le cadre de celui-ci, elle a eu certaines discussions avec ses psychiatres ou psychologues de la pr\u00e9sente instance et que ces discussions sont assujetties au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Ces discussions sont not\u00e9es dans les dossiers des psychiatres ou psychologues et ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9pur\u00e9es. Selon la plaignante, la divulgation de ces discussions lui causerait un pr\u00e9judice important et porterait atteinte \u00e0 la relation m\u00e9decin-patient, \u00e0 l\u2019acte de proc\u00e9dure et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige s\u2019applique au produit du travail de l\u2019avocat et, en ce qui concerne un document auquel s\u2019appliquerait ce privil\u00e8ge, il doit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vue d\u2019un litige ou de son utilisation dans ce litige. De l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, un dossier m\u00e9dical ne peut pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en vue d\u2019un litige ou de son utilisation dans un litige. Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante a recours incorrectement au privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige comme motif justifiant le retranchement d\u2019information des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux. L\u2019ensemble des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de ses psychiatres ou psychologues doivent donc \u00eatre produits.\nC. Documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel [16] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante a produit une copie [traduction] \u00ab lourdement \u00e9pur\u00e9e \u00bb de la transcription de son interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable dans le cadre de son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel relativement \u00e0 son accident de la route survenu en 2008. Elle demande la transcription compl\u00e8te. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande aussi la liste des documents de la plaignante qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s pour cette action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel et tout document \u00e9tayant sa demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dans le cadre de cette action, y compris la perte de la capacit\u00e9 de gains pass\u00e9e et \u00e0 venir.\n[17] Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 compter de l\u2019an 2000, mais elle n\u2019a pas signal\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souffrait de d\u00e9pression et n\u2019avait eu aucun probl\u00e8me au travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son accident de la route en 2008. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019accident, elle \u00e9tait incapable de travailler et elle a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de d\u00e9pression et de syndrome de la douleur chronique. Elle a pris pr\u00e8s d\u2019un an de cong\u00e9 pour se r\u00e9tablir et n\u2019a jamais pleinement repris ses fonctions. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son accident, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante travaillait \u00e0 plein temps et suivait un cheminement de carri\u00e8re normal pour un membre de la GRC.\n[18] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019accident de la route de la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour blessures \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9dommagement pour la perte de qualit\u00e9 de vie, la perte de salaire et la perte de possibilit\u00e9s. Comme la pr\u00e9sente plainte all\u00e8gue que la discrimination dont a fait l\u2019objet la plaignante l\u2019a fait sombrer dans la d\u00e9pression et a emp\u00each\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re de progresser, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il y a un chevauchement entre les all\u00e9gations contenues dans sa plainte et celles de sa r\u00e9clamation relative \u00e0 l\u2019accident de la route. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le plein effet de l\u2019accident doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 \u00e0 fond afin d\u2019assurer que le droit de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable est respect\u00e9.\n[19] La plaignante fait valoir que l\u2019information produite sous la contrainte des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure, notamment l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable et les listes de documents, est vis\u00e9e par un engagement implicite envers la Cour, ce qui emp\u00eache une partie de se fonder sur cette information dans d\u2019autres instances sans l\u2019autorisation de la Cour.\n[20] La Commission convient que les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019action de la plaignante faisant suite \u00e0 son accident de la route en 2008 ne sont pas assujettis \u00e0 une divulgation en raison de la r\u00e8gle implicite de confidentialit\u00e9. Elle ajoute que malgr\u00e9 le fait que les documents demand\u00e9s soient confidentiels, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est d\u00e9j\u00e0 en possession de certaines parties de la transcription de l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable de la plaignante. Selon la Commission, cela r\u00e9pond aux pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 une double r\u00e9paration en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[21] La plaignante soutient \u00e9galement que la liste de documents \u00e9tablie pour une autre instance n\u2019est pas pertinente aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente instance. L\u2019intim\u00e9e peut estimer que certains documents qui y sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s sont d\u2019une certaine fa\u00e7on pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte, mais, selon la plaignante, cela indique que l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette.\n[22] La plaignante ajoute que la r\u00e9clamation en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dans son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel ne recoupe pas celle qui est formul\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. \u00c0 son avis, elle a divulgu\u00e9 toutes les parties de la transcription de son interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable qui se rattachent aux blessures qu\u2019elle a subies, y compris lorsqu\u2019elle affirme ne pas croire qu\u2019elle souffrait de d\u00e9pression et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 en raison de l\u2019accident. La plaignante pr\u00e9tend que la partie d\u00e9fenderesse dans la poursuite intent\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019accident de la route n\u2019aurait pas accept\u00e9 de l\u2019indemniser pour les pr\u00e9judices caus\u00e9s \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9 mentale en raison de cet aveu.\n[23] En ce qui concerne la perte de salaire, la plaignante affirme avoir limit\u00e9 sa r\u00e9clamation \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 des pertes qui excluent celles qu\u2019elle a subies pendant la p\u00e9riode suivant son accident de la route, parce que ces pertes sont prises en compte dans son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel et qu\u2019elle veut ainsi \u00e9viter la double r\u00e9paration. Elle assure avoir divulgu\u00e9 toutes les parties de la transcription de son interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable qui se rapportent \u00e0 ses r\u00e9clamations pour pertes de salaire et avoir aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des rapports m\u00e9dicaux qui \u00e9tablissent une p\u00e9riode de temps au-del\u00e0 de laquelle les auteurs concluent que ses blessures ne sont plus li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019accident de la route. La plaignante a aussi fait appel \u00e0 un expert pour le calcul de la perte de salaires aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Relativement \u00e0 ces calculs, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019expert d\u2019exclure la p\u00e9riode du 24 octobre 2008 au 6 juillet 2009, soit la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite de son accident de la route.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la plaignante a mal compris en quoi consiste l\u2019indemnisation de la perte de capacit\u00e9 de gains pass\u00e9e ou \u00e0 venir. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019une perte de capacit\u00e9 de gains est indemnis\u00e9e, l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 est accord\u00e9e pour la perte de capacit\u00e9 de gains au cours de la dur\u00e9e de vie du demandeur. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019exclusion de toute r\u00e9clamation pour perte de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode d\u2019octobre 2008 \u00e0 juillet 2009 n\u2019\u00e9limine pas la possibilit\u00e9 de la double r\u00e9paration en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nD. Accord de r\u00e8glement dans l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel [25] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande aussi une quittance sign\u00e9e qui a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel de la plaignante \u00e0 la suite de son accident de la route en 2008. Elle fait valoir que la quittance informera le Tribunal du montant que la plaignante a re\u00e7u des auteurs de dommages dans sa r\u00e9clamation relative \u00e0 l\u2019accident et, par cons\u00e9quent, permettra d\u2019\u00e9viter la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une double r\u00e9paration. Sans la quittance, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas possible de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019indemnisation que la plaignante a d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ue pour la perte de capacit\u00e9 de gains et la perte de revenus pass\u00e9e et future.\n[26] Selon la plaignante, les documents de r\u00e8glement de son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le privil\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du r\u00e8glement. Elle soutient qu\u2019elle ne peut pas renoncer \u00e0 ce privil\u00e8ge sans le consentement de l\u2019autre partie \u00e0 l\u2019action en justice, parce que ce privil\u00e8ge appartient aux deux parties au r\u00e8glement. La plaignante ajoute que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a omis de pr\u00e9senter des observations expliquant pourquoi la divulgation de ces renseignements servait un int\u00e9r\u00eat public pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet que le privil\u00e8ge existe pour prot\u00e9ger les communications relatives au r\u00e8glement, mais elle souligne qu\u2019il existe des exceptions \u00e0 cette r\u00e8gle. En particulier, une exception est pr\u00e9vue lorsque les documents de r\u00e8glement sont n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer si un demandeur a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9 pour une perte de capacit\u00e9 de gains et une perte de revenus.\nIII. D\u00e9cision [28] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, les parties devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et dans la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents soient communiqu\u00e9s aux parties qui comparaissent devant le Tribunal. S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9es par les parties, il devrait \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9 en vertu des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (05\/03\/04) (les R\u00e8gles) (voir Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 42 (Guay); Association des employ\u00e9(e)s de t\u00e9l\u00e9communication du Manitoba inc. c. Manitoba Telecom Services, 2007 TCDP 28, au paragraphe 4).\n[29] En ne perdant pas de vue ces principes, voici la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal concernant la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e relative \u00e0 la communication de documents.\nA. Documents m\u00e9dicaux depuis le 1er avril 2007 [30] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, le Tribunal a reconnu que la plaignante a droit au respect de sa vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux (voir Beaudry c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2002 CanLII 45930 (TCDP), au paragraphe 7. (Beaudry); McAvinn c. Strait Crossing Bridge Ltd, 2001 CanLII 25855 (TCDP), au paragraphe 3 (McAvinn)). Toutefois, ce droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 peut cesser lorsque cette personne met son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en cause (voir McAvinn, au paragraphe 4; Guay, au paragraphe 45; Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier du Canada et Femmes-Action c. Bell Canada, 2005 TCDP 9, aux paragraphes 9 \u00e0 11; voir aussi Frenette c. M\u00e9tropolitaine (La), cie d\u2019assurance-vie, [1992] 1 RCS 647 (Frenette), et M. (A.) c. Ryan, [1997] 1 RCS 157). Cela dit, \u00ab le besoin de d\u00e9couvrir la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9viter une injustice n\u2019\u00e9carte pas automatiquement la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une protection contre une divulgation compl\u00e8te \u00bb (M. (A.), au paragraphe 33). Dans les cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la divulgation de dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, il a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement impos\u00e9 des conditions \u00e0 la divulgation afin de prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019information (voir, par exemple, Guay; McAvinn, Beaudry et Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500, Richard Wilkinson and Cliff Willicome, 2012 TCDP 11).\n[31] La plaignante a mis en cause sa sant\u00e9 mentale en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9pression et \u00e0 l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment aux principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus, tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux pertinents relatifs \u00e0 ces \u00e9tats de sant\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La plaignante a \u00e9galement mis en cause les facteurs causals de sa d\u00e9pression et de son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Compte tenu des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je suis convaincue qu\u2019il est possible que les blessures physiques de la plaignante, cons\u00e9cutives \u00e0 son accident de la route, ont peut-\u00eatre affect\u00e9 sa sant\u00e9 mentale. Par cons\u00e9quent, tous les documents m\u00e9dicaux pertinents relatifs au traitement des blessures physiques de la plaignante, cons\u00e9cutives \u00e0 son accident de la route, doivent aussi \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Les documents m\u00e9dicaux relatifs \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante qui ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessus ne sont pas en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et ne sont pas pertinents aux fins de la divulgation.\n[32] Compte tenu des observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, j\u2019estime \u00e9galement que la demande de documents m\u00e9dicaux depuis le 1er avril 2007, soit la date de l\u2019accident de la route de la plaignante, est raisonnable. Je suis convaincue que la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard ne doit pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une recherche \u00e0 l\u2019aveuglette, puisqu\u2019elle repose sur des documents que la plaignante lui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 communiqu\u00e9s. Si l\u2019accident de la route de la plaignante a affect\u00e9 sa sant\u00e9 mentale, son lien avec les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9 afin de donner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter sa preuve. La divulgation de ces documents pertinents fera \u00e9galement en sorte que le Tribunal dispose de tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pertinents et elle peut aider celui-ci dans l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e si la plainte est accueillie.\n[33] La plaignante fait valoir que les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal l\u2019obligent uniquement \u00e0 divulguer les documents en sa \u00ab possession \u00bb et ne contiennent aucune disposition au sujet des documents qui sont sous la \u00ab garde \u00bb d\u2019une partie. Comme la plaignante n\u2019a pas en sa possession les dossiers m\u00e9dicaux demand\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, elle soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas tenue d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer, d\u2019obtenir et de divulguer de tels documents.\n[34] Cependant, le paragraphe 1(2) des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u00e9nonce que celles-ci doivent \u00eatre \u00ab [\u2026] appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale par le membre instructeur dans l\u2019affaire dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, afin de favoriser les fins \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 1(1) \u00bb. Entre autres choses, l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles est de permettre que \u00ab l\u2019argumentation et la preuve soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en temps opportun et de fa\u00e7on efficace \u00bb (alin\u00e9a 1(1)b) des R\u00e8gles) et que \u00ab toutes les affaires dont le Tribunal est saisi soient instruites de la fa\u00e7on la moins formaliste et la plus rapide possible \u00bb (alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles). J\u2019ajouterais que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 1(1)c) des R\u00e8gles est conforme au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi.\n[35] Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a la plaignante d\u2019obtenir et de divulguer les documents m\u00e9dicaux pertinents fera en sorte que l\u2019objet des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal est atteint. C\u2019est la plaignante qui a droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e et la confidentialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux. Sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une assignation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et de la tenue d\u2019une audience, seule la plaignante a le pouvoir d\u2019obtenir les documents m\u00e9dicaux en question. Par cons\u00e9quent, ordonner \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019obtenir et de divulguer ses documents m\u00e9dicaux est la mani\u00e8re la plus informelle, rapide et efficace d\u2019obtenir n\u2019importe lequel de ces documents pertinents. Mis \u00e0 part le co\u00fbt \u00e9ventuel aff\u00e9rent \u00e0 l\u2019obtention de ces documents, aucun pr\u00e9judice ne semble \u00eatre caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante en proc\u00e9dant ainsi.\n[36] Par cons\u00e9quent, il est ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de divulguer les documents m\u00e9dicaux depuis le 1er avril 2007 qui se rapportent aux sympt\u00f4mes ou au traitement de la d\u00e9pression et de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et au traitement des blessures physiques li\u00e9es \u00e0 son accident de la route. En se conformant \u00e0 cette ordonnance, la plaignante doit \u00e9galement divulguer tout document pertinent mentionn\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019annexe A de sa demande de divulgation du 24 janvier 2013 ou confirmer que ces documents n\u2019existent pas.\n[37] Pour prot\u00e9ger le droit de la plaignante \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux, les documents doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et de la Commission et ne doivent \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 aucune autre personne sans l\u2019autorisation pr\u00e9alable du Tribunal et sans que la plaignante ait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e. En outre, les documents ne peuvent servir \u00e0 des fins autres qu\u2019\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate et doivent \u00eatre remis \u00e0 la plaignante au terme de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[38] Il convient de noter que cette d\u00e9cision ne porte que sur la question de la divulgation de documents m\u00e9dicaux. Toute question relative \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 en preuve de ces documents peut \u00eatre abord\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nB. Dossiers des psychiatres et psychologues \u00e9pur\u00e9s [39] Le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige \u00ab [\u2026] concerne, quant \u00e0 lui, les renseignements et documents recueillis ou \u00e9tablis dans le contexte du litige \u00bb (Blank c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2009 CF 1221, au paragraphe 37 (Blank CF)). Il touche les communications \u00ab [\u2026] entre un avocat et des tiers, ou dans le cas d\u2019une partie non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, entre celle\u2011ci et des tiers \u00bb (Blank c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2006 CSC 39, au paragraphe 27 (Blank CSC)). Le crit\u00e8re qui permet de dire si un tel privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige devrait s\u2019attacher \u00e0 un document est celui\u2011ci : \u00ab [\u2026] 1) il s\u2019agit d\u2019une communication; 2) pr\u00e9par\u00e9e ou obtenue; 3) pour l\u2019\u00ab objet principal \u00bb d\u2019un litige raisonnablement anticip\u00e9 (Blank CF, au paragraphe 37; voir aussi Blank CSC, aux paragraphes 59 et 60).\n[40] Sans plus d\u2019information au sujet des communications \u00e9pur\u00e9es entre la plaignante et ses psychiatres ou psychologues, le Tribunal ne peut d\u00e9terminer leur [traduction] \u00ab but principal \u00bb. La preuve par affidavit \u00e9non\u00e7ant le fondement factuel de la revendication de privil\u00e8ge ou autorisant le Tribunal \u00e0 voir les documents (qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse du membre actuel ou d\u2019un autre membre) serait une proc\u00e9dure appropri\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer si le privil\u00e8ge s'applique (voir M. (A.), au paragraphe 39). \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j\u2019aimerais solliciter l\u2019opinion des parties sur cette fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der. La plaignante doit pr\u00e9senter des observations sur cette question d\u2019ici le 5 avril 2013. Il est demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre d\u2019ici le 19 avril 2013. La r\u00e9plique de la plaignante doit \u00eatre re\u00e7ue au plus tard le 26 avril 2013.\nC. Documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel [41] Selon la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, \u00ab la loi impose aux parties \u00e0 un litige civil un engagement envers la cour de ne pas utiliser les documents ou les r\u00e9ponses pour toute autre fin que la recherche de la justice dans l\u2019instance civile au cours de laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenus [\u2026] \u00bb (Juman c. Doucette, 2008 CSC 8, au paragraphe 27 (Juman). Ainsi que l\u2019indiquait le Tribunal dans Bignell-Malcolm c. Bande indienne Ebb and Flow, 2008 TCDP 3, au paragraphe 24 :\nCe principe de confidentialit\u00e9 prot\u00e8ge les int\u00e9r\u00eats priv\u00e9s des individus et pr\u00e9serve l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus du contentieux civil, car sans cette protection de la vie priv\u00e9e, les parties \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure pourraient ne pas divulguer tous les faits pertinents dans le cadre de la poursuite.\n[42] Cependant, l\u2019engagement implicite peut devoir c\u00e9der le pas devant un int\u00e9r\u00eat public plus imp\u00e9rieux (voir Juman, au paragraphe 30). Au nombre des exemples d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public figurent les exceptions l\u00e9gales (voir Juman, au paragraphe 39), la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique (voir Juman, au paragraphe 40), la mise en cause de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage contradictoire (voir Juman, au paragraphe 41) ou la pr\u00e9vention de certains crimes (voir Juman, aux paragraphes 42 \u00e0 50). Dans l\u2019ensemble, pour lever l\u2019engagement implicite, il doit y avoir \u00ab [...] un int\u00e9r\u00eat public plus important que les valeurs vis\u00e9es par l\u2019engagement implicite, \u00e0 savoir la protection de la vie priv\u00e9e et le d\u00e9roulement efficace du litige civil \u00bb (Juman, au paragraphe 32). Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame a donn\u00e9 l\u2019avertissement que ce qui importe, \u00ab [\u2026] c\u2019est de reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019engagement n\u2019atteindra pas le but vis\u00e9, sauf si la personne interrog\u00e9e est convaincue que le tribunal ne le modifiera que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles \u00bb (Juman, au paragraphe 32).\n[43] Je ne suis pas convaincue qu\u2019il existe un int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u2019un poids plus important en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce qui prime l\u2019engagement implicite. Certes, l\u2019intim\u00e9e est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019une double r\u00e9paration, mais la transcription de l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable, une liste de documents et tout document \u00e9tayant sa demande de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats dans la cadre de son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel ne seront pas utiles \u00e0 cette fin. Comme l\u2019action a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, seule l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement peut pr\u00e9ciser le montant qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u par la plaignante en guise d\u2019indemnisation pour l\u2019abandon de son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a aussi demand\u00e9 la divulgation de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement; cette question est examin\u00e9e ci-apr\u00e8s.\n[44] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9galement soutenu qu\u2019elle peut utiliser la transcription de l\u2019interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable pour mettre en doute la bonne foi de la plaignante lors de l\u2019instruction. Cette simple affirmation, sans autre chose de plus pr\u00e9cis, ne me convainc pas non plus que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public doit primer sur la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019engagement implicite.\n[45] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel de la plaignante est rejet\u00e9e.\nD. Entente de r\u00e8glement dans l\u2019action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel [46] Les ententes de r\u00e8glement peuvent \u00eatre privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es ou confidentielles (voir Groupe d\u2019aide et d\u2019information sur le harc\u00e8lement sexuel au travail de la province de Qu\u00e9bec inc. c. Barbe, 2003 TCDP 15; Leslie Palm c. International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 500 and Cliff Willicome and Richard Wilkinson, 2011 TCDP 12; Dos Santos c. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada, 2005 BCCA 4). Avant de statuer sur la demande de divulgation de l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement et afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal rende une d\u00e9cision pleinement \u00e9clair\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, il serait utile de recevoir les observations de l\u2019autre partie \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement. Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de donner au Tribunal le nom et les coordonn\u00e9es de la partie d\u00e9fenderesse dans son action pour pr\u00e9judice corporel r\u00e9sultant de son accident de la route. Le Tribunal communiquera alors avec cette personne et sollicitera son opinion sur cette question, et donnera l\u2019occasion \u00e0 chaque partie de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 la position de cette derni\u00e8re. Il est demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de fournir l\u2019information n\u00e9cessaire au plus tard le 5 avril 2013.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 20 mars 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1795\/2512\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Harjinder Kaur Rai c.

Premakumar Kanagasabapathy (le plaignant) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte contre Air Canada (l\u2019intim\u00e9e) en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi). Le plaignant y all\u00e8gue que, dans le cadre de son emploi, l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a refus\u00e9 des possibilit\u00e9s de promotion en guise de \u00ab repr\u00e9sailles \u00bb et l\u2019a trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment du fait de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Le 11 janvier 2012, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) d\u2019instruire la plainte, dont la port\u00e9e exacte est l\u2019objet de la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande par voie de requ\u00eate que soit rendue une ordonnance radiant certains paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la Commission et le plaignant.\nI. Le contexte [3] En application du paragraphe 6(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (les R\u00e8gles), chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant notamment a) les faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause et b) sa position au sujet des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni le 30 ao\u00fbt 2012. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni le 13 septembre 2012.\n[4] Le 28 septembre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en vue de faire radier certains paragraphes des deux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, au motif que les paragraphes en question font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des parties de la plainte initiale qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal pour instruction, soit :\n\u2022 les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles le plaignant n\u2019a pas eu de promotion;\n\u2022 les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[5] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, avant le renvoi de la plainte, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission avait regroup\u00e9 les all\u00e9gations constituant la plainte dans trois volets distincts :\nPartie (i) : Les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019absence de promotions;\nPartie (ii) : Les all\u00e9gations relatives aux repr\u00e9sailles;\nPartie (iii) : Les all\u00e9gations relatives au traitement d\u00e9favorable, surtout en ce qui a trait au fait que le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le poste temporaire de planificateur de cabine.\n[6] Dans son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission a conclu que la preuve n\u2019\u00e9tayait pas les all\u00e9gations de discrimination pour ce qui est des parties (i) et (ii) de la plainte. Par la suite, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que, selon ce qui \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9 dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, seules les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la partie (iii) de la plainte \u2014 celles qui portaient sur le [traduction] \u00ab poste de planificateur de cabine \u00bb \u2014 n\u00e9cessitaient un renvoi au Tribunal pour instruction, et seule cette partie de la plainte devait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Les premi\u00e8re et deuxi\u00e8me parties de la plainte n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es pour instruction; elles exc\u00e8dent donc le cadre du renvoi et les paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui portent sur celles-ci doivent par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre radi\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que la radiation de ces paragraphes simplifiera l\u2019instruction et permettra au Tribunal de se concentrer sur la partie de la plainte dont il est v\u00e9ritablement saisi.\n[7] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cet argument, l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur une lettre dat\u00e9e du 11 janvier 2012, qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7ue du pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim (la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada), dans laquelle il est indiqu\u00e9 que la plainte est renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction, parce que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne pas permettre au plaignant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le poste de planificateur de cabine constituait peut-\u00eatre un acte discriminatoire. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, cela montre que le renvoi pour instruction \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la partie (iii).\n[8] La Commission s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La Commission soutient que la totalit\u00e9 de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction, pas seulement une partie de celle-ci. La Commission nie avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de rejeter des parties de la plainte, ou avoir communiqu\u00e9 une telle d\u00e9cision aux parties. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, elle conteste la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e interpr\u00e8te la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada. De plus, elle se fonde sur une autre lettre envoy\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim le 11 janvier 2012 \u2013 celle-ci adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal \u2013 dans laquelle ce dernier lui demande d\u2019instruire la plainte (la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente). Dans la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente, le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim demande simplement que la plainte soit instruite. Il ne fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune all\u00e9gation \u00e0 propos du poste de planificateur de cabine ni d\u2019aucune autre all\u00e9gation.\n[9] La Commission fait valoir que la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est essentiellement une attaque indirecte contre le processus d\u00e9cisionnel de la Commission et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande de mani\u00e8re inappropri\u00e9e au Tribunal de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen de ce processus. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Commission soutient que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence en mati\u00e8re de surveillance de la Commission. Quant aux conclusions tir\u00e9es dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission fait valoir qu\u2019elles ne lient aucunement le Tribunal.\n[10] Le plaignant soutient que la totalit\u00e9 de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction; elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tronqu\u00e9e ni divis\u00e9e en sections. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le plaignant fait valoir que l\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant le poste de planificateur de cabine est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. Si le Tribunal devait limiter la port\u00e9e de la plainte selon l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e, le plaignant subirait un pr\u00e9judice, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le r\u00e9cit des faits \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses arguments serait min\u00e9. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que, si la lettre de renvoi est ambigu\u00eb de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit, le Tribunal doit dissiper cette ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en sa faveur, en admettant les pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il souhaite invoquer. En outre, il fait valoir que l\u2019instruction du Tribunal se d\u00e9roule sans que ce dernier se fonde sur le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission ou sur les motifs de renvoi de la plainte.\n[11] En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e all\u00e8gue que les recommandations formul\u00e9es dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et les observations des parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du rapport sont n\u00e9cessaires pour la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les motifs de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission sont expos\u00e9s dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate lui-m\u00eame; il s\u2019agit du seul document auquel il est fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la Loi comme fondement de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission sur la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der. De plus, dans la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada, les recommandations formul\u00e9es dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9taient reproduites telles quelles, ce qui indique que la Commission accepte pour l\u2019essentiel toutes les conclusions du rapport, y compris celle recommandant d\u2019\u00e9carter les parties (i) et (ii) de la plainte. L\u2019intim\u00e9e invoque des d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures o\u00f9 le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas uniquement fond\u00e9 sur le libell\u00e9 strict de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer la plainte afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e du renvoi. Elle souligne \u00e9galement que le libell\u00e9 de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente. Dans la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada, on recommande l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une m\u00e9thode contextuelle pour \u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e du renvoi.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le plaignant peut d\u00e9fendre sa cause \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la partie (iii) de la plainte (les all\u00e9gations relatives au fait de ne pas avoir r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le poste de planificateur de cabine) sans se fonder sur les all\u00e9gations figurant \u00e0 la partie (i) (les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019absence de promotions) ou la partie (ii) (les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles). Elle fait \u00e9galement valoir qu\u2019il vaudrait mieux, par \u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires, ne pas consacrer les ressources du Tribunal \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme n\u2019\u00e9tant pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve et qui ne n\u00e9cessitent pas un examen plus pouss\u00e9.\n[13] Selon les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une m\u00e9thode contextuelle pour \u00e9tablir la port\u00e9e du renvoi requiert l\u2019examen de la plainte, du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. La lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9cision et n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e aux parties. Cette lettre n\u2019\u00e9quivaut \u00e0 rien de plus qu\u2019un transfert administratif du dossier au Tribunal; lier le Tribunal au contenu de la lettre revient \u00e0 ne pas tenir compte du contenu de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9e aux parties.\n[14] Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2012, dans un addenda aux observations d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e fait mention de la correspondance envoy\u00e9e par le plaignant \u00e0 la Commission avant le renvoi de la plainte devant le Tribunal, correspondance dans laquelle celui-ci semblait accepter les conclusions du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate selon lesquelles il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9 de renvoyer les all\u00e9gations figurant aux parties (i) et (ii) pour instruction. L\u2019intim\u00e9e fait valoir qu\u2019elle s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur ces assertions du plaignant.\n[15] Le 7 janvier 2013, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019addenda d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse, le plaignant a reconnu que la correspondance en question ne mettait pas en doute le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Il soutient toutefois que la correspondance ne lie pas la Commission dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dont elle dispose. Il fait \u00e9galement valoir qu\u2019aucune pr\u00e9clusion n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l\u2019emp\u00eacher de plaider une interpr\u00e9tation plus large de la lettre de renvoi au Tribunal. Enfin, il fait remarquer que, vu qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas acc\u00e8s au dossier complet dont la Commission \u00e9tait saisie, il ne peut pas savoir quelle incidence la correspondance a eue sur la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au Tribunal.\nII. L\u2019analyse [16] Dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9e demande au Tribunal de d\u00e9finir la port\u00e9e du renvoi dont il est saisi. Avant d\u2019aborder les faits particuliers de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il convient de faire certaines observations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales.\nLe r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gal [17] En vertu de la Loi, la Commission peut charger un enqu\u00eateur d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur une plainte. Un enqu\u00eateur pr\u00e9sente son rapport \u00e0 la Commission le plus t\u00f4t possible apr\u00e8s la fin de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, soit le \u00ab rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00bb susmentionn\u00e9 (aux paragraphes 43(1) et 44(1)).\n[18] Selon l\u2019article 44, sur r\u00e9ception du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission a le pouvoir de prendre diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9cisions \u2013 et doit informer par \u00e9crit les parties \u00e0 la plainte de la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle a prise. Suivant le paragraphe 44(3), si elle est convaincue qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas lieu de renvoyer la plainte \u00e0 une autre autorit\u00e9 ou de la rejeter parce qu\u2019elle est hors d\u00e9lai, qu\u2019elle ne rel\u00e8ve pas de sa comp\u00e9tence, ou qu\u2019elle est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi, la Commission peut demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte en application de l\u2019article 49.\n[19] Le paragraphe 49(1) pr\u00e9cise que la Commission peut pr\u00e9senter de telles demandes au pr\u00e9sident si elle est convaincue, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, que l\u2019instruction est justifi\u00e9e. Il convient de souligner que les demandes vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en tout temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\nLa correspondance du pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim [20] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate se r\u00e9sume donc \u00e0 une incoh\u00e9rence pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e entre deux lettres sign\u00e9es le m\u00eame jour par le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim.\n[21] La \u00ab lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb est r\u00e9put\u00e9e constituer une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 49, par le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim, et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 celle qui \u00e9tait alors la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une lettre assez br\u00e8ve, qui informe la pr\u00e9sidente que la Commission a examin\u00e9 la plainte, puis mentionne ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLa Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte, car elle est convaincue, compte tenu de toutes les circonstances, qu\u2019un examen est justifi\u00e9.\n[22] Fait \u00e0 noter, la \u00ab lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb est muette au sujet des diff\u00e9rentes all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans la plainte, des recommandations de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, des conclusions formul\u00e9es dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate ou des d\u00e9tails que celui-ci renferme.\n[23] La \u00ab lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada \u00bb est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rente. La lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada est bien entendu adress\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais, en dehors de cela, elle est \u00e9galement beaucoup plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e.\n[24] Le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim explique tout d\u2019abord que, avant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission a examin\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab [...] le rapport qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement [...] \u00bb (vraisemblablement le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate), ainsi que les observations d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse au rapport. Il explique ensuite pourquoi la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait hors d\u00e9lai. Vient ensuite le paragraphe cl\u00e9 :\n[Traduction]\nIl est \u00e9galement recommand\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, que la Commission demande \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire la plainte parce que :\n\u25aa la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 constitue une question et, comme l\u2019enqu\u00eateur n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, un examen plus approfondi s\u2019impose;\n\u25aa la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de ne pas permettre au plaignant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer son poste de planificateur de cabine en raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de rendement a peut-\u00eatre servi de pr\u00e9texte pour ne pas r\u00e9tablir le plaignant dans le poste du fait de sa race et de son origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[25] Ce paragraphe a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, parce qu\u2019il fait ressortir une partie des all\u00e9gations figurant dans la plainte : les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la partie (iii). De plus, le paragraphe reproduit pratiquement la recommandation formul\u00e9e dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate \u2013 le m\u00eame rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate dans lequel il a apparemment \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que les all\u00e9gations relatives aux parties (i) et (ii) de la plainte n\u2019\u00e9taient pas \u00e9tay\u00e9es par la preuve.\n[26] Cependant, malgr\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rences constat\u00e9es, la \u00ab lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada \u00bb comporte des similitudes importantes avec la \u00ab lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb :\n\u2022 aucune des lettres n\u2019indique qu\u2019une partie de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e;\n\u2022 aucune des lettres n\u2019indique qu\u2019on a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019une partie de la plainte fasse l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction.\n[27] Malgr\u00e9 ces caract\u00e9ristiques, l\u2019intim\u00e9e consid\u00e8re que la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada constitue une indication claire de la part de la Commission que [traduction] \u00ab [...] la totalit\u00e9 de la plainte n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal [...] \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9e est plut\u00f4t d\u2019avis que la Commission demandait que seules les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la partie (iii) de la plainte fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction (les all\u00e9gations relatives au fait que le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 le poste de planificateur de cabine).\n[28] Pour les motifs qui suivent, il m\u2019est impossible de retenir les arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et je dois rejeter la requ\u00eate.\nLe caract\u00e8re d\u00e9terminant de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente [29] \u00c0 mon avis, compte tenu du libell\u00e9 du paragraphe 49(1), la \u00ab meilleure preuve \u00bb de la demande d\u2019instruction qu\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e la Commission \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente est ceci : la lettre que la Commission a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente pour lui demander d\u2019instruire la plainte. Dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, la lettre de demande d\u2019instruction est sign\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident par int\u00e9rim, mais, chose plus importante encore, elle est adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal. Il s\u2019agit du document qui met en branle tout le processus d\u2019instruction du Tribunal. Il s\u2019agit donc du document qui permet d\u2019\u00e9tablir si la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 ou non.\n[30] La Commission peut pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019instruction \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une seule partie de la plainte. Comme le souligne l\u2019intim\u00e9e, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest que la Commission avait comp\u00e9tence pour renvoyer deux volets d\u2019une plainte pour instruction par un tribunal pendant qu\u2019elle poursuivait son enqu\u00eate sur un troisi\u00e8me volet de la plainte (Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest c. A.F.P.C. (1999) 162 F.T.R. 50)). Cependant, je suis d\u2019avis que, si, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission avait voulu demander l\u2019instruction d\u2019une partie de la plainte seulement, cette intention aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 manifeste dans la lettre de demande d\u2019instruction envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Johnston c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2007 TCDP 42, au paragraphe 6, on peut lire ce qui suit :\nLe 11 juin 2003, la Commission a avis\u00e9 le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal qu\u2019elle ne renvoyait que la partie de la plainte portant sur l\u2019article 10 devant Tribunal, car elle avait jug\u00e9 que la partie portant sur l\u2019article 7 devait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. [\u2026]\n[31] De m\u00eame, la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Territoires du Nord\u2011Ouest comporte l\u2019observation suivante :\nLa Commission a inform\u00e9 le GTNO dans une lettre en date du 27 mai 1997 qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la Loi de demander au pr\u00e9sident du Comit\u00e9 de constituer un tribunal pour enqu\u00eater sur les volets de la plainte relatifs aux articles 7 et 11.\n[Paragraphe 8, Le texte n'est pas en caract\u00e8res gras dans l'original.]\n[32] Il n\u2019y a aucune restriction de ce genre dans la lettre de demande d\u2019instruction envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Je conclus donc que la totalit\u00e9 de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente pour instruction et que j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour instruire la plainte dans sa totalit\u00e9.\n[33] Compte tenu de l\u2019importance primordiale que j\u2019accorde \u00e0 la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente, le contenu de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada ne peut pas l\u2019emporter sur cette lettre.\n[34] En outre, le fait d\u2019invoquer la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada pour justifier l\u2019instruction d\u2019une simple partie de la plainte pose probl\u00e8me pour d\u2019autres raisons \u00e9galement. La lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada n\u2019est pas adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, ni \u00e0 quelque agent de ce dernier. Il semble s\u2019agir d\u2019un avis \u00e9crit envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 44, lequel l\u2019informe de la d\u00e9cision prise en application de la disposition. Il s\u2019agit donc d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment du m\u00e9canisme de traitement des plaintes de la Commission qui ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Comme l\u2019a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Warman, 2012 CF 1162 (appel en instance A\u2011456-12), au paragraphe 56 :\nPlus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence en ce qui concerne l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de la Commission aux termes du paragraphe 44(3) (rejet ou renvoi d\u2019une plainte) et de l\u2019article 47 (nomination d\u2019un conciliateur) de la LCDP. Un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est la voie qu\u2019il convient de suivre pour contester une d\u00e9cision de la Commission touchant de telles questions.\n[35] Une conclusion semblable a \u00e9t\u00e9 tir\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal d\u2019examiner le processus d\u00e9cisionnel de la Commission suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) (Voir I.L.W.U. (Section maritime), section locale 400 c. Oster, 2001 CFPI 1115, au paragraphe 30.\n[36] L\u2019intim\u00e9e invite le Tribunal \u00e0 s\u2019impr\u00e9gner de la m\u00e9thode d\u2019enqu\u00eate, des conclusions et des recommandations formul\u00e9es par l\u2019enqu\u00eateur, du libell\u00e9 du rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et des similitudes apparentes entre celui-ci et la lettre envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e par la suite, qui l\u2019avisait de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, cela n\u2019est pas acceptable. Cependant, m\u00eame si cela l\u2019\u00e9tait, le Tribunal n\u2019est d\u2019aucune mani\u00e8re li\u00e9 par le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et les opinions de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur. (Voir Bell Canada c. SCEP, [1999] 1 C.F. 113, [1998] A.C.F. no 1609 (QL) (C.A.), QL 37; Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations, 2006 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 29 et 30; Emmett c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2012 TCDP 3, aux paragraphes 4 et 5).\n[37] Dans une certaine mesure, l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9e est compr\u00e9hensible. Elle a re\u00e7u une d\u00e9cision conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 44, qui, selon son interpr\u00e9tation, restreignait la port\u00e9e de la demande d\u2019instruction. Une telle interpr\u00e9tation n\u2019est toutefois pas confirm\u00e9e par la mesure prise par la Commission en application de l\u2019article 49. Il est raisonnable que l\u2019intim\u00e9e se demande pourquoi il en est ainsi, surtout compte tenu des conclusions formul\u00e9es dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, dont le libell\u00e9 de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Air Canada semble s\u2019\u00eatre inspir\u00e9. Mais c\u2019est \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et non au Tribunal, que l\u2019intim\u00e9e doit poser cette question, dans une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission. M\u00eame si l\u2019on accepte l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lequel la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente n\u2019est pas une d\u00e9cision en soi, mais un simple \u00ab transfert administratif \u00bb, c'est cette lettre de demande adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente qui donne comp\u00e9tence au Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte.\n[38] Le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9terminant de la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 c. A.G. Canada, 2003 TCDP 32, aux paragraphes 12 et 13, o\u00f9 le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la th\u00e8se selon laquelle, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les conclusions d\u00e9j\u00e0 formul\u00e9es par la Commission quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la plainte, la Commission n'\u00e9tait plus en mesure de renvoyer au Tribunal la plainte dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 l\u2019invitation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00ab [...] aller au\u2011del\u00e0 de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission et de r\u00e9examiner celle-ci afin de d\u00e9terminer si la CCDP \u00e9tait habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 faire un tel renvoi. \u00bb Il a mentionn\u00e9 que le pouvoir de surveillance sur les faits et gestes de la Commission et ses d\u00e9cisions est exclusivement du ressort de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la proposition selon laquelle le Tribunal peut bel et bien aller au-del\u00e0 de la lettre de demande d\u2019instruction adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente par la Commission afin de v\u00e9rifier si, en fait, la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Dans la d\u00e9cision Kowalski, comme la Commission avait rendu une d\u00e9cision expresse selon laquelle certains aspects de la plainte ne \u00ab [...] seraient pas l\u2019objet de plus amples consid\u00e9rations [...] \u00bb, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 bon de s\u2019\u00e9carter de la d\u00e9marche suivie dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9. Il a conclu que, m\u00eame si, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, la lettre de demande d\u2019instruction envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente renvoyait la totalit\u00e9 de la plainte, ce document contredisait la correspondance ant\u00e9rieure envoy\u00e9e aux parties, dans laquelle la Commission avait communiqu\u00e9 des \u00ab d\u00e9cisions explicites \u00bb de ne pas traiter de certaines parties de la plainte.\n[40] Je ne crois pas que la d\u00e9cision rendue dans Kowalski me permet de trancher la question dont je suis saisie. Tout d\u2019abord, \u00e0 mon humble avis, la d\u00e9cision Kowalski n\u2019est pas tout \u00e0 fait conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9marche \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9; les m\u00eames raisons qui militent contre l\u2019\u00e9tude par le Tribunal du dossier pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le renvoi dans l\u2019affaire C\u00f4t\u00e9 sont tout aussi valables dans le contexte des d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Commission avant le renvoi dans l\u2019affaire Kowalski. Dans chacune de ces affaires, on demande au Tribunal d\u2019\u00ab aller au-del\u00e0 \u00bb d\u2019une demande d\u2019instruction claire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente, afin de trouver des ambigu\u00eft\u00e9s et des contradictions dans le traitement de la plainte par la Commission avant son renvoi. De plus, le pouvoir exclusif de surveillance \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale reconnu dans la d\u00e9cision C\u00f4t\u00e9 semblait \u00eatre tout aussi pr\u00e9sent dans la d\u00e9cision Kowalski pour corriger des divergences pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es entre la demande d\u2019instruction et les \u00ab d\u00e9cisions explicites \u00bb rendues ant\u00e9rieurement.\n[41] S\u2019il s\u2019av\u00e8re que mon interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9cision Kowalski est incorrecte, j\u2019ajouterais simplement qu\u2019une distinction peut \u00eatre faite entre les faits de cette affaire et ceux dont je suis saisie. Il n\u2019y a rien dans le dossier dont je suis saisie qui me permette de penser que, \u00e0 quelque moment que ce soit, la Commission avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en application d\u2019une disposition de la Loi, que les all\u00e9gations figurant aux parties (i) et (ii) de la plainte ne \u00ab seraient pas l\u2019objet de plus amples consid\u00e9rations \u00bb. (Voir la d\u00e9cision Kowalski, au paragraphe 3.)\n[42] Enfin, dans son addenda aux observations d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e veut invoquer encore un autre \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a eu lieu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape du traitement de la plainte par la Commission. Dans les observations qu\u2019il a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission concernant le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate, le plaignant a apparemment convenu que les parties (i) et (ii) de la plainte \u00e9taient sans fondement, ce qui, de l\u2019avis de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une d\u00e9claration concernant la port\u00e9e de la plainte, sur laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est fond\u00e9e. Pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, je ne peux pas consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un motif pour remettre en question la demande claire et non \u00e9quivoque envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne le 11 janvier 2012. Tout au plus, ce dernier argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9e illustre bien les dangers que comporte la d\u00e9marche qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9conise, soit essentiellement de demander au Tribunal de r\u00e9viser de facto par voie de certiorari la fa\u00e7on dont la Commission a trait\u00e9 et r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la plainte. Pareille tentative ne sert ni le souci de l\u2019\u00e9conomie des ressources judiciaires invoqu\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ni l\u2019instruction rapide prescrite par le l\u00e9gislateur. Plus important encore, le Tribunal ne peut pas exercer un pouvoir de surveillance qu\u2019il ne poss\u00e8de tout simplement pas.\n[43] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 20 mars 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1771\/0412\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Premakumar Kanagasabapathy c.

La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. 9\nI. Introduction [1] Le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2012, l\u2019intim\u00e9e British Columbia Maritime Employers Association (la BCMEA) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire en vue d\u2019obtenir le rejet des plaintes de discrimination (les plaintes) d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre elle par plusieurs d\u00e9bardeurs (les plaignants). \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa demande, la BCMEA a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un affidavit d\u2019Eleanor Marynuik, vice\u2011pr\u00e9sidente, Ressources humaines, BCMEA, souscrit le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2012 (l\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik).\n[2] Le 16 janvier 2013, International Longshore and Warehouse Union (le syndicat) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une lettre officielle dat\u00e9e du 2 janvier 2013, qui constituait sa demande de rejet des plaintes. La demande du syndicat est fond\u00e9e sur les faits figurant dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik.\n[3] Le 21 janvier 2013, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son m\u00e9moire dans lequel elle demandait le rejet de la requ\u00eate.\n[4] Le 23 janvier 2013, le syndicat a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une lettre suppl\u00e9mentaire en r\u00e9ponse au m\u00e9moire de la Commission.\nII. Les Plaintes [5] Dans les plaintes, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, en violation des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), en raison de la cessation de leur emploi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans. Chacun des plaignants a \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9 de prendre sa retraite pendant la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er mai 2009 au 1er juin 2010.\nArticle 7\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d\u2019employer ou de continuer d\u2019employer un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\nArticle 10\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\na) de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite;\n[\u2026]\n[6] Les intim\u00e9s invoquent l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) pour justifier la cessation de l\u2019emploi des plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans.\nArticle 15(1)\nNe constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\n[\u2026]\nc) le fait de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne en appliquant la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour ce genre d\u2019emploi;\nIII. Le fondement des requ\u00eates en rejet des plaintes [7] Le syndicat a formul\u00e9 ainsi la question dont le Tribunal est saisi :\n[traduction]\nLors du d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes et de leur renvoi au Tribunal par le Commission, il y avait de l\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). Cette incertitude a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e lorsque la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada c. Robert Neil Kelly et al., 2012 CAF 209 (Air Canada). Par cons\u00e9quent, la seule question \u00e0 trancher par le Tribunal est celle de savoir si 65 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). [\u2026] (Le texte n'est pas en caract\u00e8res gras dans l'original)\nL\u2019analyse statistique figurant dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik, aux paragraphes 27 \u00e0 30, \u00e9tablit que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les d\u00e9bardeurs \u00e9tait de 65 ans ou moins pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n[8] La BCMEA invoque aussi l\u2019arr\u00eat Air Canada, en mentionnant que [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, la retraite obligatoire \u00e9tait permise en vertu de la (Loi), et elle continue de l\u2019\u00eatre. \u00bb (Le texte n'est pas en caract\u00e8res gras dans l'original)\nIV. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dan l\u2019arr\u00eat Air Canada [9] L\u2019arr\u00eat Air Canada rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est d\u00e9terminant pour ce qui est des questions soulev\u00e9es dans les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires des intim\u00e9s en vue d\u2019obtenir le rejet des plaintes. La Cour a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) portait atteinte \u00e0 la protection offerte par la Constitution contre les mesures discriminatoires fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, mais \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins constitutionnellement valide, vu qu\u2019il se d\u00e9fendait au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n[10] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Air Canada, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle du stare decisis, elle devait se conformer \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229, [1990] A.C.S. no 122 (McKinney), et que le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9taient li\u00e9s par l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinney.\n[11] L\u2019arr\u00eat McKinney portait sur une disposition du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario, qui autorisait la mise \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a statu\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si la disposition portait atteinte \u00e0 la protection offerte par la Constitution contre les mesures discriminatoires fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins constitutionnellement valide, car elle se d\u00e9fendait au regard de l\u2019article premier de la Charte.\n[12] L\u2019arr\u00eat Air Canada portait sur la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans des pilotes George Vilven et Robert Kelly selon les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019une convention collective et d\u2019un r\u00e9gime de pension \u00e9tablis entre Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. Chacun des pilotes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la Loi : M. Vilven, en 2004, et M. Kelly, en 2006. Le Tribunal a entendu leurs plaintes ensemble en 2007. Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada se sont fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle en mati\u00e8re de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c). Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que, compte tenu des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de l\u2019affaire, l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinney n\u2019\u00e9tait plus une d\u00e9cision ayant force obligatoire; et, lorsqu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9 l\u2019affaire, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, mais n\u2019a pas d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e9tait invalide. Elle a plut\u00f4t effectu\u00e9 une analyse d\u00e9taill\u00e9e expliquant pourquoi l\u2019affaire McKinney ne s\u2019appliquait pas aux plaintes de MM. Vilven et Kelly.\nV. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du litige A. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour statuer sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire des intim\u00e9s visant le rejet des plaintes [13] La BCMEA a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 A.C.F. no 439, 2004 CF 81 (confirm\u00e9e par 2004 CAF 363) comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent expliquant la comp\u00e9tence qu\u2019a le Tribunal pour entendre des requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de disposition particuli\u00e8re dans la Loi \u00e0 ce sujet, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour rejeter, sur requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, une plainte qui lui est renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission.\n[14] Je conclus que j\u2019ai comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les requ\u00eates pr\u00e9liminaires des intim\u00e9s. J\u2019accepte la d\u00e9claration de l\u2019avocat du syndicat, lorsqu\u2019il affirme que [traduction] \u00ab la question \u00e0 trancher est restreinte et les faits qui sous-tendent les requ\u00eates sont simples. \u00bb\nB. L\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik : faits pertinents [15] L\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik \u00e9tablit les faits et les circonstances qui suivent :\n1. La BCMEA est l\u2019agent n\u00e9gociateur repr\u00e9sentant ses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s membres.\n2. Les d\u00e9bardeurs employ\u00e9s par les soci\u00e9t\u00e9s membres de la BCMEA font le chargement et le d\u00e9chargement de la cargaison de navires dans tous les ports de la Colombie\u2011Britannique.\n3. Les d\u00e9bardeurs en Colombie\u2011Britannique ne travaillent pas dans d\u2019autres ressorts.\n4. La BCMEA n\u00e9gocie une convention collective cadre avec le syndicat et administre l\u2019application de la convention collective en collaboration avec diverses sections locales du syndicat.\n5. Les plaignants, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de membres du syndicat ou de travailleurs occasionnels, \u00e9taient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la convention collective.\n6. Les dates de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de chacune des plaintes de discrimination :\nJozef Antalik \u2013 15 avril 2010\nWerner Hofer \u2013 15 septembre 2009\nDennis Horgan \u2013 20 janvier 2010\nBob Kopeck \u2013 22 septembre 2010\nKenneth Geroge Martens \u2013 25 novembre 2010\nDavid Williams Gibbs \u2013 19 novembre 2010\nEnricco Diricco \u2013 25 novembre 2010\n7. Pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1989 \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2010, les plaignants \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une convention collective qui ne comportait pas de limite d\u2019\u00e2ge pour la retraite. La convention collective comportait toutefois une disposition portant sur les pensions, \u00e0 l\u2019article 13 - PENSIONS. [traduction] \u00ab 13.01 Les m\u00e9canismes de pension s\u2019appliquant aux employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s par la pr\u00e9sente convention sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans le Waterfront Industry Pension Plan et la Waterfront Industry Pension Agreement. \u00bb Les m\u00e9canismes de pension s\u2019appliquant aux membres du syndicat, dont les plaignants, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis en vertu de la convention collective et sont r\u00e9gis par le Waterfront Industry Pension Plan (WIPP).\n8. Pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1989 \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2010, selon le WIPP, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur \u00e9tait 65 ans. Les plaignants ont eu 65 ans aux dates suivantes et, le premier jour du mois suivant, ils ont cess\u00e9 de pouvoir effectuer le travail de d\u00e9bardeur :\nM. Hofer \u2013 17 avril 2009\nM. Horgan \u2013 24 juin 2009\nM. Diricco \u2013 7 juillet 2009\nM. Gibbs \u2013 14 d\u00e9cembre 2009\nM. Kopeck \u2013 1er janvier 2010\nM. Antalik \u2013 19 mars 2010\nM. Martens \u2013 15 mai 2010\n9. En septembre 2010, les fiduciaires du WIPP ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des modifications au r\u00e9gime de pension au Surintendant des institutions financi\u00e8res du Canada, lesquelles modifications permettaient aux d\u00e9bardeurs qui atteignaient l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans apr\u00e8s le 31 octobre 2010 de prendre leur retraite ou de continuer \u00e0 travailler et de prendre leur retraite apr\u00e8s 65 ans. Dans le WIPP modifi\u00e9, il est indiqu\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur est 65 ans.\n10. Le 2 novembre 2010, la BCMEA a inform\u00e9 les d\u00e9bardeurs qu\u2019\u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 2010, ils pouvaient travailler apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans; la BCMEA a aussi inform\u00e9 tous les travailleurs qui avaient pris leur retraite entre le 1er novembre 2009 et le 1er novembre 2010 qu\u2019ils pouvaient choisir de reprendre le travail. Le plaignant M. Gibbs n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu et le plaignant M. Antalik a r\u00e9pondu, mais a choisi de ne pas travailler.\n11. En 2010, 4 662 d\u00e9bardeurs travaillaient pour des employeurs membres de la BCMEA.\n12. Jusqu\u2019au 1er novembre 2010, la totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bardeurs avait pris leur retraite au plus tard \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans, comme le pr\u00e9voyait le WIPP, et un grand nombre d\u2019entre eux avaient pris leur retraite avant 65 ans.\n13. Pendant la p\u00e9riode allant de 1989 \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2010, les contrema\u00eetres du syndicat avaient des m\u00e9canismes de pension semblables \u00e0 ceux des d\u00e9bardeurs, qui pr\u00e9voyaient la mise \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire au plus tard \u00e0 65 ans.\n14. L\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik comporte une analyse statistique du nombre total de d\u00e9bardeurs, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de membres du syndicat, de travailleurs occasionnels versant des cotisations \u00e0 la fiducie de bien\u2011\u00eatre ou de travailleurs occasionnels \u2013 que l\u2019on envoyait quotidiennement travailler pour les employeurs membres de la BCMEA \u2013 qui ont pris leur retraite \u00e0 65 ans ou avant pendant la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er janvier 2005 au 31 octobre 2010. L\u2019analyse est fond\u00e9e sur les donn\u00e9es tir\u00e9es du syst\u00e8me interne de renseignements sur les ressources humaines pour le Waterfront de la BCMEA, lequel comprend des renseignements tels que les dates de naissance et les dates auxquelles le statut des d\u00e9bardeurs est pass\u00e9 de celui d\u2019employ\u00e9 actif \u00e0 celui d\u2019employ\u00e9 retrait\u00e9.\n[16] Je conclus qu\u2019Eleanor Marynuik conna\u00eet tr\u00e8s bien le secteur du d\u00e9bardage en Colombie\u2011Britannique, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la convention collective entre la BCMEA et le syndicat, et les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi des d\u00e9bardeurs. Son affidavit est \u00e9tay\u00e9 par la preuve, convaincant et exhaustif.\n[17] L\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik fournit un fondement factuel pour la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle les plaignants ont pris leur retraite; et il sous\u2011tend les requ\u00eates en rejet des plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la BCMEA et le syndicat. De plus, l\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik tient compte des all\u00e9gations de discrimination des plaignants et les contredit.\n[18] Dans sa lettre du 23 janvier 2013, dans laquelle il a r\u00e9pondu aux observations \u00e9crites pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la Commission sur cette requ\u00eate, M. Bruce Laughton, c.r., l\u2019avocat du syndicat, a mentionn\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab La requ\u00eate vise essentiellement \u00e0 affirmer que les plaignants n\u2019ont aucune chance d\u2019avoir gain de cause sur le fond, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne peuvent pas contester que 65 ans est l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour les personnes qui sont dans une situation semblable \u00e0 la leur. [...] Cette requ\u00eate n\u2019emp\u00eache en rien les plaignants de traiter de la question. Ils ont le droit de d\u00e9poser leurs propres affidavits et de pr\u00e9senter des faits qui contesteraient la th\u00e8se du syndicat. [\u2026] ni les plaignants ni la Commission ne se sont pr\u00e9valus de cette possibilit\u00e9. [\u2026] \u00bb\nC. Est-ce que 65 ans \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pendant la p\u00e9riode pertinente? [19] Selon l\u2019article 7 et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a) de la Loi, il est discriminatoire de refuser de continuer d\u2019employer un individu du fait de son \u00e2ge ou de fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite qui annihilent les chances d\u2019emploi d\u2019un individu du fait de son \u00e2ge.\n[20] La mise \u00e0 la retraite des plaignants \u00e9tait prescrite par les dispositions en mati\u00e8re de pension figurant dans la convention collective; les dispositions sont indissociables de leur emploi et de leur retraite en tant que d\u00e9bardeurs; les dispositions permettaient aux d\u00e9bardeurs d\u2019avoir la certitude qu\u2019ils toucheraient un revenu et auraient droit \u00e0 une pension. Je conclus que la cons\u00e9quence de ces dispositions contractuelles \u00e9tablies depuis longtemps, soit la mise \u00e0 la retraite obligatoire des plaignants, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e2ge au regard des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi.\n[21] Plus important encore, les intim\u00e9s ont soutenu [traduction] \u00ab [...] que l\u2019exception au principe de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) s\u2019applique eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances des plaignants. [\u2026] [une] exception [\u2026] qui suffit pour trancher les plaintes sur le fond. \u00bb\n[22] Pour que l\u2019exception soit admise, les intim\u00e9s doivent indiquer un groupe de comparaison comportant des postes semblables \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019occupaient les plaignants ou bien se fonder sur le caract\u00e8re singulier du secteur du d\u00e9bardage en Colombie-Britannique. Il n\u2019y a pas de groupe de comparaison comportant des postes semblables \u00e0 des terminaux portuaires dans la province. Cependant, en raison de la position singuli\u00e8re et dominante qu\u2019occupent la BCMEA et le syndicat, je conclus que le groupe de comparaison correspond \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des d\u00e9bardeurs membres du syndicat qui sont employ\u00e9s par la BCMEA. Une d\u00e9cision anormale de ce genre a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e appropri\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven c. Air Canada, [2009] A.C.F. no 475, confirm\u00e9e en appel dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Air Canada.\n[23] La pr\u00e9cision, dans la section portant sur le WIPP dans la convention collective, que l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite est 65 ans dans le secteur du d\u00e9bardage en Colombie\u2011Britannique, est logique : elle a pour effet de d\u00e9finir que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur est de 65 ans; et les donn\u00e9es statistiques figurant dans l\u2019affidavit de Mme Marynuik me convainquent que l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur \u00e9tait de 65 ans au cours de la p\u00e9riode allant de 2005 \u00e0 2010.\nVI. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent et compte tenu des conclusions que j\u2019ai tir\u00e9es, je conclus qu\u2019en obligeant les plaignants \u00e0 prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pas commis un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, les requ\u00eates des intim\u00e9s sont accueillies et les plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

Dans sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission le 16 janvier 2009, la plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles envers elle parce qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re plainte, au sens de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[3] Pendant une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal de son intention de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en modification des plaintes pour y ajouter d\u2019autres all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision porte sur cette requ\u00eate.\nI. La modification des plaintes [4] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal a le pouvoir de modifier une plainte \u00ab aux fins de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb (Canderel Ltd. c. Canada, [1994] 1 CF 3 (CAF); cit\u00e9 dans Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313, au paragraphe 30). Pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il doit autoriser la modification, le Tribunal n\u2019examine pas en d\u00e9tail le fond de la modification propos\u00e9e. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on devrait autoriser une modification, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l\u2019objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es (voir Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 6 [Bressette]; et Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 7 [Virk]).\n[5] Cela dit, une modification ne peut pas servir \u00e0 introduire fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cela contournerait le processus de renvoi pr\u00e9vu par la Loi (voir Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, aux paragraphes 7 \u00e0 9; et, Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 45929 (TCDP), aux paragraphes 11). La modification propos\u00e9e doit \u00eatre li\u00e9e, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale (voir Virk, au paragraphe 7; Tran, Cam-Linh (Holly) c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2010 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 17-18; et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2012 TCDP 24, au paragraphe 16 [SSEFPN et al.])\n[6] De plus, il faut examiner s\u2019il pourrait y avoir pr\u00e9judice lorsqu\u2019une modification est propos\u00e9e. Une modification ne doit pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00ab [si elle] cause un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Parent, au paragraphe 40).\nII. La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [7] La plaignante soutient que sa famille et elle ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes de repr\u00e9sailles depuis qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission en 2008. En somme, elle soutient que : l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de sa famille aux prestations vers\u00e9es par le programme d\u2019aide sociale de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas correctement \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9e; l\u2019intim\u00e9e l\u2019a accus\u00e9e \u00e0 tort d\u2019avoir fraud\u00e9 l\u2019aide sociale et a r\u00e9sist\u00e9 aux efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour r\u00e9soudre la question; l\u2019intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 son fils le droit d\u2019occuper la r\u00e9sidence du d\u00e9funt p\u00e8re de la plaignante dans la r\u00e9serve de la Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook; son mari et elle ont eu beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir du financement, auquel ils auraient d\u00fb avoir droit, pour accro\u00eetre leurs qualifications professionnelles. La plaignante soutient que ces probl\u00e8mes ne sont apparus qu\u2019apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en 2008.\n[8] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019autres actes de repr\u00e9sailles commis par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements pour lesquels elle pr\u00e9sente des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ces all\u00e9gations. Entre autres, la plaignante soutient que les probl\u00e8mes en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination des prestations d\u2019aide sociale auxquelles sa famille avait droit ainsi que le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accorder des prestations sociales \u00e0 son mari ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 2008 et se poursuivent. Cette p\u00e9riode correspond au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa premi\u00e8re plainte. Toutes ses all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires visent la m\u00eame intim\u00e9e que dans sa plainte initiale et elle soutient que les actes de repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9s sont li\u00e9s au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de cette plainte initiale. Pour cette question, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un argument soutenable quant aux repr\u00e9sailles, a li\u00e9 ces repr\u00e9sailles aux all\u00e9gations qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa premi\u00e8re plainte, et il n\u2019est pas manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l\u2019objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la plaignante, en pr\u00e9sentant des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles, n\u2019a pas clairement indiqu\u00e9 les mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle demande ni les motifs sur lesquels elle se fonde, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 3(1)c) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04). Cependant, la plaignante soutient que les mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle demande sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tablies dans la premi\u00e8re plainte et que les all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires quant aux repr\u00e9sailles visent \u00e0 renforcer sa demande de redressement. D\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission, la seule question \u00e0 trancher dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est celle de savoir si la plainte devrait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e pour permettre l\u2019ajout d\u2019une deuxi\u00e8me plainte de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[10] La plaignante a clairement \u00e9tabli les mesures de redressement qu\u2019elle demande lors de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance qui a eu lieu le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2013 : faire modifier les plaintes pour ajouter des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles. Par cons\u00e9quent, conform\u00e9ment au calendrier \u00e9tabli pour la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites, la plaignante a fourni, le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2013, ses motifs justifiant sa demande de modification. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse le 6 mars 2013. La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse les 11 et 15 mars 2013, et la Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses observations le 21 mars 2013. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une communication suppl\u00e9mentaire le 19 mars 2013, le Tribunal a aussi accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019occasion de fournir des observations suppl\u00e9mentaires quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte et a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le fond des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles serait examin\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience si la requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte \u00e9tait accueillie. Par cons\u00e9quent, par la tenue de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance et la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites des autres parties, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es et des motifs de la requ\u00eate en modification de la plaignante. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a subi aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient aussi que, plut\u00f4t de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de modifier sa plainte, le Tribunal devrait l\u2019obliger \u00e0 respecter la proc\u00e9dure quant aux plaintes qui est \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l\u2019article 40 de la Loi et exiger que la plaignante d\u00e9pose une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles distincte \u00e0 la Commission. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, le processus d\u2019examen des plaintes de la Commission comprend des \u00e9tapes proc\u00e9durales qui pourraient r\u00e9gler la question avant qu\u2019elle ne se rende au Tribunal. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre priv\u00e9e de ces \u00e9tapes proc\u00e9durales. Dans un autre ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission souligne que, si la modification n\u2019est pas accord\u00e9e, il sera peut-\u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de tenir une audience distincte pour r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. La Commission soutient que cela irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des principes de l\u2019administration de la justice et de l\u2019\u00e9conomie judiciaire. La Commission ajoute que, de toute fa\u00e7on, l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subira pas de pr\u00e9judice si la modification est accord\u00e9e, parce qu\u2019elle aura amplement l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles devant le Tribunal.\n[12] Dans le contexte d\u2019une requ\u00eate en modification d\u2019une plainte pour y ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : \u00ab [i]l ne devrait pas \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire que des all\u00e9gations voulant que des repr\u00e9sailles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une plainte donnent lieu \u00e0 une instance distincte \u00bb (Bressette, au paragraphe 6). Comme la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate de l\u2019Ontario l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans Entrop v. Imperial Oil Ltd. (No. 3), (1994) 23 C.H.R.R. D\/186, au paragraphe 9 :\n[traduction]\nIl ne serait pas pratique, efficace et juste d\u2019exiger qu\u2019une personne ne soul\u00e8ve des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles que dans le cadre d\u2019une instance distincte. Cela l\u2019obligerait \u00e0 retourner au bout de la file pour qu\u2019il y ait enqu\u00eate, conciliation et traitement de questions qui sont fondamentalement li\u00e9es \u00e0 une instance d\u00e9j\u00e0 en cours. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les repr\u00e9sailles visent \u00e0 intimider ou \u00e0 forcer un plaignant \u00e0 renoncer au respect de ses droits pr\u00e9vus par le Code, cela entraverait l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure initiale et d\u00e9valoriserait l\u2019objet \u00e9vident du Code de prot\u00e9ger les plaignants des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives qui peuvent survenir parce qu\u2019ils ont demand\u00e9 la protection pr\u00e9vue par le Code.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00ab il est logique que la preuve relative \u00e0 des actes commis en repr\u00e9sailles du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soit entendue dans le contexte de l\u2019audience de cette m\u00eame plainte \u00bb (Karen Schuyler c. Oneida Nation of the Thames, 2005 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 8, voir aussi SSEFPN et al., au paragraphe 16).\n[14] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne re\u00e7oive pas l\u2019avantage d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et d\u2019un rapport de la Commission au sujet des all\u00e9gations suppl\u00e9mentaires de repr\u00e9sailles soulev\u00e9es par la plaignante, elle aura n\u00e9anmoins l\u2019occasion pleine et enti\u00e8re de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations. Tout pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ce sujet peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e par la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la plaignante. Cela permettra aussi \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de souligner les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante qui, \u00e0 son avis, ne sont pas claires, sont difficiles \u00e0 suivre ou portent sur le traitement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d\u2019autres personnes que la plaignante.\n[15] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate en modification des plaintes est accueillie. Les parties doivent d\u00e9poser des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s en fonction d\u2019un calendrier qui sera \u00e9tabli lors de la prochaine t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance le 12 avril 2013.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon\nJuge administrative\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 10 avril 2013\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1658\/1311 et T1659\/1411\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Stacey Lee Tabor c.
