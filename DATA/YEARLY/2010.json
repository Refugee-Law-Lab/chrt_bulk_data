THE COMPLAINT [1] This is a decision regarding a complaint made by Wayne Douglas, as Complainant, against SLH Transport Inc. (\u201cSLH\u201d), as Respondent, dated July 11, 2007. The Complaint alleges that SLH discriminated against him by terminating his employment as a consequence of a physical disability, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[2] The inquiry by this Tribunal into the Complaint was requested by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) as being warranted pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d) by letter dated August 26, 2008.\n[3] The Commission did not appear at the Hearing.\nII. SECTION 7 OF THE ACT [4] The Complaint cites subsection (a) of the above noted section of the Act as the discriminatory practice that the Respondent engaged in on the basis of Mr. Douglas\u2019 disability. This section reads as follows:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(a) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nThe prohibited ground of discrimination cited in the Complaint is disability pursuant to s. 3 (1) of the Act.\nIII. FACTS [5] Wayne Douglas is 37 years old. He started to work with SLH on September 21, 1998 as a part-time truck driver. Approximately six months later he was made a full-time employee of SLH. He has a grade ten education. His employment with SLH was terminated on May 11, 2007 while he was on a long term disability leave waiting for surgery to be performed on his right knee.\n[6] Throughout his career as a truck driver with SLH, Mr. Douglas always worked on a \u201cpeddle\u201d run night shift from SLH\u2019s terminal in Bedford north of Halifax along the south shore of Nova Scotia west from Bedford. This run consists of a drive of approximately seven hundred kilometers in total, stopping at twelve Sears catalogue stores or depots from Bedford west to Yarmouth and back again delivering Sears catalogue goods ranging from lighter items such as clothing, jewellery and bedding to heavier \u201cbig ticket\u201d items such as snow blowers, stoves, washers, lawn tractors and large quantities of insulation shrink wrapped and loaded onto pallets. The truck consists of a two seat non-sleeper cab, the back of which is hitched to the front of a trailer that is approximately fifty feet long.\n[7] A \u201cpeddle\u201d run has a team of two - the principal driver and an assistant who can also drive. The driver and the assistant unload the goods at each of the stores or depots and take back returned goods. Some of the stores or depots have loading docks where the trailer can be lined up at the grade of the dock. Others do not have loading docks and a ramp from the trailer is required to unload and load the goods. Since a lot of the goods are heavy, the trucks come equipped with two wheel hand dollies and sometimes, depending on the load, an hydraulic pallet jack for goods loaded on pallets.\n[8] There are ordinarily four \u201cpeddle\u201d run night shifts and one \u201cpeddle\u201d run day shift operating out of the Bedford terminal. The loading and unloading of the trailers at the terminal is done by dock workers. A driver goes into the terminal about half an hour before his run starts to fill out paper work and \u201cpre-trip\u201d the truck, by checking such things as fluids, lights, belts, hoses, tires and brakes. He then hooks the truck to the trailer and proceeds to begin to drive his run. When he returns to the terminal at the end of his run he pulls in his truck to the dock, unhooks the trailer and then drives the truck to the fuel pump, fills it with fuel and parks it.\n[9] The SLH terminal at Bedford is one of two terminals it has in the Maritimes - the other one is located in Moncton, New Brunswick. The Bedford terminal has about forty employees including six mechanics, three full-time dock workers, an operational manager, a regional manager, an accounting clerk, a payroll manager, a sales person, a driver\/trainer, two and one half dispatchers, five teams of \u201cpeddle\u201d drivers consisting of two drivers on each team, two part-time drivers and six day-time and night-time line haul drivers.\n[10] The head office for SLH is in Kingston, Ontario. SLH has about one thousand employees across Canada. In 2006, SLH had its second best year from a profit point of view. In 2007, SLH had its best year. In 2008 it had almost as good a year as in 2007, however, after summer, business fell off dramatically. In 2007 there were approximately thirty more employees than there are today in the Bedford and Moncton terminals as the recent recession has hurt SLH\u2019s business. Since the Fall of 2008 business has declined and there is no longer any shortage of truck drivers. In 2009 the volume of business is off by thirty percent to the date of the hearing.\n[11] Mr. Douglas was paid on the basis of fifteen hours of paid time allocated for his \u201cpeddle\u201d run (the \u201csouth shore\u201d run). If a \u201cpeddle\u201d run driver is able to drive this run in less than fifteen hours he still receives the same pay. Most of the time the driver is able to complete this run in approximately ten to twelve hours with about two to three hours of the time spent in loading and unloading and most of the rest of the time driving. A driver is never paid for any days except for the days that he actually works and only for the time allotted for his run plus any overtime to do it. Most of the time Mr. Douglas drove three nights a week but, each year, as Christmas approached it got busier and he would drive four nights a week and even five nights a week.\n[12] The trailers are virtually always loaded almost full to the back (door) with sufficient head room for safety and with a small space at the right corner of the back of the trailer to allow entry room for the driver and his assistant to unload the trailer. A significant percentage (fifty to seventy five percent) of the goods delivered and picked up on a \u201cpeddle\u201d run weigh well in excess of one hundred pounds and involve heavy lifting of \u201cbig ticket\u201d items. The dollies and pallet jack stored in the trailer are of assistance, but heavy lifting and manoeuvring involving lifting, pushing and pulling of goods in excess of one hundred pounds is a core aspect of the \u201cpeddle\u201d run job taking about sixty percent of the loading and unloading time for the \u201cpeddle\u201d run driver and his assistant.\n[13] Mr. Douglas is currently employed with Hudson\u2019s Bay Company (\u201cHBC\u201d) as a truck driver. He started his job at the beginning of April, 2009. The work with HBC is purely \u201cpin\u201d work involving driving a similar truck to the one that he drove at SLH. He now drives five nights a week from the HBC terminal in Dartmouth Nova Scotia either to Moncton, New Brunswick or to Lincoln, New Brunswick and back. On a \u201cpin\u201d run at HBC there is only one driver and no assistant. He still has to hitch up the trailer and put the legs up and down and check under the hood and under the truck as part of the pre-trip examination, however, his job now at HBC involves pure \u201cpin\u201d or \u201cpin to pin\u201d work with no loading, unloading or lifting required by the driver.\n[14] SLH\u2019s core business since its inception in 1989 has been \u201cpeddle\u201d runs to Sears stores. SLH now also does \u201cnon-peddle\u201d full truck load commercial hauling (\u201cTL\u201d). In TL, SLH hauls for one customer to different stops. This is mainly done in day time short run hauling. In this work SLH truck drivers do not normally do pure \u201cpin\u201d work or \u201cpin to pin\u201d work. In TL there is virtually always loading and unloading with heavy lifting approximately ten to twenty percent of the time (as opposed to \u201cpeddle\u201d runs where there is heavy lifting about sixty per cent of the time). On rare occasions, SLH might have a \u201cpin to pin\u201d assignment without any heavy loading and unloading on a short TL daytime line haul but this would not be very frequent and would not involve enough work to create one full time job, particularly in the current poor economic climate. It is unlikely that currently SLH could set up a truck driving job where there would be no heavy lifting since there is not enough volume to generate a full time job for anybody in that category without reducing the number of hours for the rest of the truck drivers to unacceptable levels.\n[15] The Government of Nova Scotia has recently introduced a new pilot project known as the long combination vehicle (\u201cLCV\u201d) program that is presently being tested as an environmental initiative to reduce green house gases by running four piece tractor trailers. There is a cab, a fifty three foot trailer, and a converter to join the first fifty three foot trailer to the last or second fifty three foot trailer. SLH has been approved to be involved in the pilot project but has not yet been finally approved to actually run it. The vehicles for this program can only be run on divided highways. The run that SLH is hoping to use, if it gets finally approved for this program, is the so called \u201cmail\u201d route (not a real \u201cmail\u201d delivery) that it currently has from Bedford (Halifax) to Moncton. It is mainly a \u201cpin\u201d run involving catalogue merchandise but it is not a pure \u201cpin\u201d run and still involves some loading, unloading and lifting of heavy goods. There have been three SLH employees that have been trained at a training facility in Calgary to do LCV driving.\n[16] Mr. Douglas testified before the Tribunal in support of his complaint. He acknowledged that SLH was a good employer. SLH has a work place health and safety program, a driving information and training program including the handling of dangerous goods, a drug and alcohol abuse prevention policy and an employee assistance program (\u201cEAP\u201d). SLH has no specific policy on discrimination in the work place per se that gives employees information with respect to human rights legislation and practices.\n[17] In the Fall of 2006 Mr. Douglas testified that he experienced pain and discomfort in his right knee. He felt a loss of stability and diminished control of his steps going up and down ramps while moving goods in and out of trailers during work shifts. His knee felt like it was giving out on him. He also felt discomfort while sitting and driving. He did not report any problem with his right knee to his employer prior to November 17, 2006 when he advised his boss, Mr. Clyde Smith, SLH\u2019s Regional Manager for the Maritimes, that he was going to be off work for a couple of weeks because of his knee problem. He told Mr. Smith that the injury was not work related. According to Mr. Douglas, he had been limping for some time before November 17, 2006 and some of his co-workers would have observed this condition. According to Mr. Smith, however, his right knee condition was not known by SLH management prior to November 17, 2006.\n[18] On November 20th, 2006 Mr. Douglas went to see Dr. Leckey who sent him for x-rays and referred him to Dr. Stalker, a sports doctor at Dalhousie University to review the x-rays. He obtained a doctor\u2019s note from Dr. Leckey dated November 27, 2006 saying that he was going to be off work indefinitely due to his right knee problem. He gave the doctor\u2019s note to Mr. Smith on November 27th. Mr. Smith told him to look after his knee and fill out all of the proper paper work required and keep him informed of his progress. On December 18th, 2006 he saw Dr. Stalker who felt that he would probably need knee surgery. Dr. Stalker referred him to Dr. Gross, an orthopedic surgeon. On January 11th, 2007 Mr. Douglas saw Dr. Gross who told him that he needed to have surgery for a medial meniscus tear and cyst on his right knee. Dr. Gross indicated that the surgery would be done within about six months. Mr. Douglas advised Mr. Smith of this after he saw Dr. Gross.\n[19] Mr. Douglas had a history of absences for medical reasons prior to his absence related to his right knee. He was off work for acute mental stress from June 21st until September 1st, 2001. He was also off work from March 11, 2002 until August 19th, 2003 as a result of surgery on his left knee. On both of these occasions that he was off work he received both short term disability (\u201cSTD\u201d) and long term disability (\u201cLTD\u201d) benefits through Sun Life Financial (\u201cSun Life\u201d) under the benefit program at SLH. He filled out all of the necessary forms in order to qualify for these benefits with the help of his life partner Lisa Gillis including providing all medical information required. In both cases his job was held open for him and his benefits continued to be paid. Upon his return from both of these prior disabilities SLH returned him to his job as a \u201cpeddle\u201d run truck driver without any restriction on his duties.\n[20] With the assistance of Lisa Gillis, Mr. Douglas filled out the necessary forms and was approved for STD benefits until March 23, 2007 for his right knee condition after an assessment was carried out. He indicated on the forms that his injury was not work related. As STD benefits are available for approximately seventeen weeks, he completed, again with the assistance of Lisa Gillis, the necessary forms for transitioning from STD benefits to LTD benefits. Mr. Douglas was approved by Sun Life for LTD benefits to March 23, 2009 and SLH was informed of this.\n[21] Mr. Douglas filled out the forms for Sun Life with respect to his right knee condition the same way as he had filled out the forms with respect to his left knee condition several years earlier. There was no request from SLH to Mr. Douglas between the end of November of 2006 and the beginning of April of 2007 for information concerning his health other than a letter from Sue Reid, SLH\u2019s Payroll and Benefits Administrator in February, 2007 reminding him to fill out the transition forms for Sun Life to qualify for LTD benefits after March 23rd and Mr. Smith\u2019s requests in November, 2006 and January, 2007 to keep him posted. During the time that Mr. Douglas was employed by SLH and off work on LTD, SLH continued to pay his share of the Sun Life benefit coverage premiums together with its own share since he was not being paid a salary, but SLH expected him to pay his share of his benefit coverage costs back. He was often late in his benefit coverage repayments to SLH.\n[22] In January of 2007 Mr. Smith was visited by Ed Dugas, a Federal government employee who was responsible for Canada Labour Code compliance matters in the area. During his visit Mr. Smith discussed Mr. Douglas\u2019 situation with Mr. Dugas. Mr. Smith wanted to know what his obligation was under the Canada Labour Code to hold Mr. Douglas\u2019 position open in the eventuality of a long term medical leave. Mr. Dugas told Mr. Smith that under the Canada Labour Code he needed only to keep the position open for twelve weeks from the first day of the medical leave. He also told him that there would be no severance required to be paid to Mr. Douglas if terminated. Mr. Dugas told Mr. Smith that he should contact Mr. Douglas for an update on his condition and when he might return to work.\n[23] In late April of 2007, Mr. Douglas went to the Bedford terminal to repay SLH some health benefit coverage premiums. While he was there Mr. Bill Oakley, SLH\u2019s Operations Manager, asked him to sign a form prepared by Mr. Smith containing a number of questions related to his health situation. Mr. Douglas did not think that the form was of any great significance. He had not seen the form before, although according to Mr. Smith and Ms. Reid, it had been mailed to him previously by registered mail but was not picked up. He asked Mr. Oakley whether he needed to have a physician or anyone else help him answer the questions. Mr. Oakley did not indicate to him that he needed anyone else to assist him with the questions.\n[24] Mr. Douglas filled out the form while he was at the terminal that day. One of the questions asked him if his surgery had not been performed, whether he had a surgery date? He answered that the date was six months to a year from the date of filling out the form but in answer to a subsequent question he answered that he had no date for surgery. He was also asked what would a reasonable estimate of an expected date of return to work be? Mr. Douglas\u2019 answer to this question was also between six months and a year. The form was prepared to follow up on the advice that Mr. Dugas had given to Mr. Smith in January. Mr. Smith had never prepared a form like this for any other employee who was off work on a medical leave. Very recently, according to Mr. Smith, forms such as this have been utilized for employees on medical leave.\n[25] According to Mr. Smith, when he reviewed Mr. Douglas\u2019 responses to the form he became convinced that Mr. Douglas\u2019 absence would be in excess of a year to a year and a half like his previous absence for surgery to his left knee. He felt that Mr. Douglas\u2019 responses were unsatisfactory since he still had no date for surgery and since the time frames given in answer to both of the questions referred to above were the same with no time contemplated for recovery from surgery, that had taken six months in the case of Mr. Douglas\u2019 left knee surgery.\n[26] Mr. Smith\u2019s evidence was that he needed a full-time replacement to meet business demand at that time as SLH was entering into a busy part of the year - Spring and early Summer when big ticket items needed to be shipped. SLH had already lost several key \u201cpeddle\u201d run drivers in 2006 and part-time employees, were totally utilized. Mr. Smith felt that Mr. Douglas\u2019 absence was creating a burden especially when he also had to work in vacation and Christmas time off for other employees and juggle assignments to make things work. He had to have part-time people cover for shifts and move driver assistants over to do primary driving on \u201cpeddle\u201d runs. At that time in 2007, drivers were in heavy demand and could not easily be hired on a part-time basis. The company had lost a number of drivers to the boom economy in Western Canada. Mr. Smith therefore felt he had to act from a business\/operational point of view.\n[27] On May 11, 2007 a termination letter was sent by Mr. Smith to Mr. Douglas. The letter provided as follows:\n\u201f Thank you for providing the update to your current absence as recently requested. It is truly regrettable that what was supposed to be a fairly short absence when first reported in November of 2006, has now turned into one that could last an additional 6 months to a year from the present date. The long term absence of a full time employee does cause SLH Transport operational difficulties and a reduced level of service to the customer. That is something we are not prepared to endure an additional time on your behalf. SLH Transport has again gone well beyond the 12 week maximum that we are required to keep your job open, as dictated by Canada Labor Code regulations for medical leave. Yet, we still have no return to work date in the foreseeable future. We will therefore be severing your ties to SLH Transport effective May 14, 2007 and filling the vacated full time position to more efficiently utilize our staff and better service our customer.\n[28] Mr. Douglas was devastated and humiliated by this letter. He felt he had done a good job for over eight years at SLH. He had just purchased a new house and was anxious about how he was going to be able to keep up the payments for the house. He became fearful, anxious, despondent, moody and depressed as a result of the letter of termination. He felt it was unfair to be terminated while waiting for a surgery date that he had no control over and that this was not consistent with what had been done for other truck drivers currently off on medical leave.\n[29] Mr. Smith\u2019s evidence was that his decision to terminate Mr. Douglas was strictly a business decision based on his operational needs as referred to above. He had no personal animus towards Mr. Douglas. His view was that Mr. Douglas was adequate as a truck driver but was a marginal employee lacking in the necessary skill, mental capacity and leadership qualities to do more complex jobs like dispatching.\n[30] He had concerns about the fact that Mr. Douglas had been off on medical leave for almost two years of the eight years that he actually was employed by the company and had, in Mr. Smith\u2019s view, failed to keep the company up to date with his health situation or prognosis while off for both of the knee conditions. Mr. Smith felt that Mr. Douglas was not a team player or motivated to do any extra work beyond the minimum number of shifts offered to him. As a result, his earnings were among the lowest of any of the SLH truck drivers according to Mr. Smith.\n[31] Mr. Smith says that he did not terminate Mr. Douglas based upon any rumour or innuendo but he did admit to hearing stories about Mr. Douglas riding his dirt bike or ATV and going fishing while he was off on medical leave for his right knee - something that Mr. Douglas denied. He was also somewhat skeptical about Mr. Douglas\u2019 efforts to obtain an early surgery date and return to work any earlier than eighteen months to two years from when he went on leave. In this regard, Mr. Smith contrasted his own experience in proactively being able to obtain a surgery date and return to work from rotator cuff surgery within several months to Mr. Douglas\u2019 inability to get an earlier surgery date and return. Mr. Smith indicated that if he had been told in April of 2007 that Mr. Douglas\u2019 absence would be in the range of four to six months and if Mr. Douglas had kept him informed and worked with him, Mr., Smith would have held his job open for that length of time, but due to operational needs he would not do so without any more definitive information than he had received from Mr. Douglas by the date of termination.\n[32] Prior to sending him the form of April and then terminating Mr. Douglas, Mr. Smith did not contact Mr. Douglas to see how he was or check on his progress or attempt to find him light duties or modified work pending surgery. Nor did Mr. Douglas contact Mr. Smith directly with an update or to ask him to find him modified work. Mr. Smith admitted in his evidence that when he terminated Mr. Douglas he did not know or try to determine whether Mr. Douglas would be able to return to work as a truck driver at SLH with the capability of lifting heavy items as required in all normal truck driving assignments with the firm whether \u201cpeddle\u201d work or non \u201cpeddle\u201d work or to do any other work for SLH. At no time did he attempt to accommodate Mr. Douglas or consider light duties or other work for him.\n[33] When he terminated Mr. Douglas, Mr. Smith had no further interest in having him work for SLH and was focused instead on hiring a replacement. After Mr. Douglas was terminated SLH took no steps to reinstate him and find him a job despite contacts from Sun Life conveying Mr. Douglas\u2019 desire to return to work. SLH made no inquiries into whether, following surgery, he was qualified to do truck driving or any other work with the firm. There was no evidence given at the hearing to indicate that Mr. Douglas made any direct contact with SLH to be rehired in any capacity after he was terminated but he did advise Sun Life of his desire to return to work at SLH. Sun Life, through Carmen LeFort, a Health Management Consultant, did make inquiries of Sue Reid on behalf of Mr. Douglas in this regard, to no avail.\n[34] When Mr. Douglas was off work and on LTD for his previous two ailments, SLH held his job open and allowed him to come back and resume his truck driving duties which included heavy lifting. SLH did not request that he fill out a form indicating his date of surgery or date of return and did not express concern about needing a full time replacement. Other truck drivers at SLH were also treated in the same way as this over the years and returned to their full time truck driving jobs after LTD albeit without any restriction on lifting heavy goods. Aaron Douglas, the complainant\u2019s brother, had both knee surgery and hernia surgery and returned to his job after being off for medical leave and in receipt of LTD benefits for several months. He was accommodated with light duties on account of his hernia condition pre-surgery for a short period of time.\n[35] At least four other SLH truck drivers who had been off between one to almost four years on LTD and Worker\u2019s Compensation medical leave were not terminated or requested to give surgery dates and return dates. Their benefits continued to be paid by SLH. No issue respecting the need to terminate these employees or to find replacements for them was raised by SLH. There was no evidence of any other SLH employee who had actually been fired while off on LTD and waiting for surgery or fired for any other reason. There was evidence that no one had lost their jobs at SLH because of recent difficult economic conditions but vacancies were not being filled.\n[36] During the time that Mr. Douglas worked in 2006 prior to his being off work in November of that year, he earned a gross salary of approximately $3,000.00 a month. He was paid on a bi-weekly basis with deductions taken off his pay for income tax, his contribution to his RRSP of approximately 4% which was matched by the company and deductions for the Sun Life Benefit package. The Sun Life benefit package covered medical, dental and life insurance benefits. This package was paid for 65% by the company and 35% by Mr. Douglas. The amount of Mr. Douglas\u2019 contribution on a bi-weekly basis for this benefit package was approximately $77.00. The LTD benefit coverage was paid for entirely by Mr. Douglas as part of the $77.00 bi-weekly payment.\n[37] The net bi-weekly amount that Mr. Douglas received in this period immediately prior to going off with a disability came to about $800.00 every two weeks. After Mr. Douglas went off and was being paid under the LTD following his termination, he no longer received any payments from the company for coverage with Sun Life for medical, dental, life insurance and for the company\u2019s contribution to his Registered Retirement Savings Plan. He had to rely on Ms. Gillis\u2019 health benefits from her employment during this time that were not entirely sufficient to pay all health expenses such as physiotherapy costs, part of which Sun Life voluntarily paid until his discharge from physiotherapy in September of 2008. He did receive, on a monthly basis LTD benefits of $1,830.00 so that his bi-weekly net amount was approximately the same when he was on LTD as when he was working. This is partly because the monthly amount for LTD was not taxable. As well, he did not have any deductions for either a pension contribution or other benefit coverage costs.\n[38] During all periods when Mr. Douglas was receiving LTD benefits there would also have been no payments for the disability coverage since he was receiving disability benefits. In essence, therefore, Mr. Douglas\u2019 net income was approximately the same after his termination until the disability payments ended on March 23, 2009 as it would have been had he been working. During this period of time, if he was still employed by SLH, had he not been off on a disability but was not working for some other reason (i.e. because he didn't\u2019t want to take shifts or because the company had no work for him), he would not have been paid by the company other than for his benefits since he was only paid if he actually worked. On the other hand, if he was working during this time at SLH, the disability benefits would have ceased and he would have been paid his normal compensation together with the company\u2019s share of the costs of benefits.\n[39] Prior to the termination, Ms. Gillis had regularly been in contact with Dr. Gross\u2019 office to see if a surgery date was available for Mr. Douglas. Since the letter of termination cited his inability to get a date for surgery within a reasonable period of time as a reason for termination, with Ms Gillis\u2019 assistance, Mr. Douglas wrote to Dr. Gross\u2019 office soon after he was terminated indicating that he was fired because of his inability to get an appointment for surgery and asked to know if Dr. Gross had a date for surgery for him. The letter asked Dr. Gross to advise whether a date had been set and to indicate whether Mr. Douglas was definitely waiting for surgery. In response Dr. Gross wrote him back on May 17, 2007 to advise him that he could not give him a surgery date since the allocation of dates was on a priority basis and it would take some time before it was booked. Dr. Gross expressed his frustration and sympathy about this situation.\n[40] Subsequently, Mr. Douglas went to see Dr. Leckey to find out if she could refer him to someone who could do the surgery more quickly. She contacted Dr. Yepes, a surgeon in Cape Breton. It was a four hour drive to Dr. Yepes\u2019 office in Sydney that Mr. Douglas made with his brother Aaron to see him in October of 2007. Dr. Yepes told him that he needed surgery and would contact him when he had a date for surgery in New Waterford. Ms. Gillis continued to contact Dr. Yepes\u2019 office regularly to try to get a surgery date for Mr. Douglas.\n[41] On January 17, 2008 Mr. Douglas had his surgery as a result of a cancellation that occurred in Dr. Yepes\u2019s surgery schedule. Following surgery he saw Dr. Yepes for post operative consultations approximately six weeks after the surgery and then went to physiotherapy at Beaverbank Orthopaedic and Sport Physiotherapy (\u201cBeaverbank\u201d) three times a week.\n[42] Mr. Douglas started to get physiotherapy at Beaverbank in March of 2008. Physiotherapy was performed by Chris Bergman, a physiotherapist and principal of Beaverbank three times a week until September of 2008 when Ms. Bergman discharged Mr. Douglas as his progress had, by then, according to her \u201cplateaued\u201d. Mr. Douglas was given exercises to perform both at the clinic and at home. Initially he had significant pain and discomfort regularly around his right knee when he began the exercises but as time passed and he continued with physiotherapy and the exercises at home, his condition improved in about June of 2008. Generally his strength improved, however, when there was weight bearing on his right knee, Mr. Douglas had greater difficulty than with non-weight bearing exercises since some of the cushioning had been taken out of the knee by the surgery.\n[43] On September 23, 2008 Ms. Bergman performed a functional assessment of Mr. Douglas. This is also known as a physical abilities assessment. The test was administered at the request of Carmen LeFort, to determine the rehabilitation potential of Mr. Douglas. As a result of the testing of Mr. Douglas, Ms. Bergman, determined that in September of 2008 he could not do either heavy or very heavy lifting but could do medium lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling. This would mean that he could occasionally lift items that were twenty one to fifty lbs., frequently lift items that were eleven to twenty five lbs. and constantly lift items that were one to five lbs. Ms. Bergman\u2019s opinion was that, as a result of the condition of his right knee, he could not lift items such as fridges, stoves, washers, dryers and lawn tractors that were normally included in the \u201cpeddle\u201d runs that he had worked at SLH, even with the equipment provided by SLH on \u201cpeddle\u201d runs.\n[44] At the request of the complainant\u2019s counsel, Ms. Bergman also prepared a letter on March 23, 2009 based on the functional assessment results of September, 2008 to determine whether Mr. Douglas could have, as at September, 2008, returned to work with or without accommodation on a modified or full-time basis in the various categories of \u201cpeddle\u201d work truck driving, \u201cpin\u201d work truck driving, without heavy lifting or \u201cadministrative\u201d non-truck driving work. She found that he could not have returned to \u201cpeddle\u201d or non \u201cpeddle pin\u201d work with heavy lifting but could have returned to non \u201cpeddle pin\u201d work truck driving without heavy lifting and could have returned to work in an administrative job from a physical point of view.\n[45] Ruth Duggan is an occupational therapist who is self employed at Cornerstone Occupational Therapy Consultants (\u201cCornerstone\u201d). She along with Chris Bergman gave expert evidence at the hearing. Ms. Duggan does job demands analysis, forensic rehabilitation and has done functional capacity evaluation to determine whether injured employees can be matched to or accommodated in various work settings within the industrial sector. Without actually ever meeting or examining Mr. Douglas, she was asked by SLH to review his medical file and to take the medical information and functional information from the file in order to determine what his abilities were. She was then to look at the jobs that were available at SLH and analyze those jobs to see if there were any jobs that would match Mr. Douglas\u2019 ability and capability and if there were any reasonable accommodations that could be made. She wrote her report on May 7, 2009. Before writing her report, she met with Mr. Smith and interviewed him about different jobs that were available at SLH. She also visited the terminal for about a half a day at Bedford to observe the operation. She watched employees doing their jobs and interviewed a number of them about their various tasks. She conducted a number of inquiries including weighing items and observing situations in order to do her research.\n[46] Ms. Duggan assumed that the physical abilities assessment or functional capacity assessment that was done by Ms. Bergman in September of 2008 was correct. She assumed that Mr. Douglas\u2019 capabilities were to do work at a medium physical demand level such as lifting, carrying, moving, pushing or pulling items up to about fifty pounds on an occasional basis and up to about twenty five pounds on a more frequent basis over the course of a day. She also reviewed a transferrable skills analysis report that had been prepared by Banyan Work Health Solutions (\u201cBanyan\u201d) in May of 2008 as requested by Sun Life that identified a few different jobs that Mr. Douglas could probably do.\n[47] While truck driving was something that was identified by Banyan as a match, Ms. Duggan was of the view that since truck driving meant different things depending on what was required of the individual, it was necessary to determine what that term meant in relation to the jobs available at SLH. She looked at the different truck driving jobs at SLH including the \u201cpeddle\u201d run which she found fell into a heavy difficult demand situation from a physical requirement point of view requiring frequent lifting of items over fifty pounds even with two people on the job. She found that that would be a heavy physical demand that Mr. Douglas was not capable of handling.\n[48] Ms. Duggan also looked at the \u201cnon-peddle\u201d work which could occasionally be \u201cpin\u201d work without lifting but would still require medium physical demand to lift the legs on the tractor to the trailer. That would be a medium task that Mr. Douglas was capable of doing. However, the \u201cpin\u201d work only represented a minority of \u201cnon-peddle\u201d work on a normal day and it varied from day to day. The majority of \u201cnon-peddle\u201d work on a normal day involved loading, unloading and lifting by only one employee of heavy items to a certain extent. Accordingly, her understanding was that \u201cnon-peddle\u201d work involved some heavy lifting at SLH and that Mr. Douglas would not be capable of doing that work since he was not capable of performing beyond a medium difficult demand. As such, Ms. Duggan was of the opinion that Mr. Douglas could not do truck driving at SLH since it always involved some heavy lifting beyond his capability.\n[49] Ms. Duggan then looked at other jobs that were available at SLH, including the job of dispatcher since the Banyan report had identified this as being a potential job match. She found that the dispatch job required more than just typical dispatching duties but also had a supervisory role attached to it that put it in a different category in terms of cognitive skills required, as well as organizational, communication and leadership skills. She found that this job included possible confrontational situations with employees and customers, as well as disciplinary situations. She felt that while Mr. Douglas might have the physical capability to do this job there was no evidence to support the conclusion that he could do the job from a thinking perspective or from a supervisory\/management perspective. She admitted, however, that there had been no testing done of Mr. Douglas\u2019 mental capabilities or other capabilities for this job.\n[50] Ms. Duggan also looked at the potential for Mr. Douglas to work as a mechanic at SLH, however, to be a mechanic one needed to have certain training, including a four year training course. She concluded that this was not an appropriate job match for Mr. Douglas. She also looked at other administrative duties including clerical jobs at SLH but found that there was no suitable match for these jobs since Mr. Douglas had no experience, qualifications or training for any of them.\n[51] On May 28, 2009, at the request of Ms. Raymond, Ms. Bergman reviewed the report of Ms. Duggan. She agreed with Ms. Duggan that neither the \u201cpeddle\u201d run nor a \u201cnon-peddle\u201d run involving manual heavy lifting, loading and unloading would be a match for Mr. Douglas\u2019 lifting capabilities. Ms. Bergman indicated that she felt that Mr. Douglas could do the job of dispatcher from a physical point of view but noted that the Duggan report indicated that he did not have the needed numerical and clerical skills to perform that job. Ms. Bergman felt that he should be tested objectively with respect to those requirements. She agreed with Ms. Duggan that Mr. Douglas was not appropriately trained to perform the duties of a mechanic.\n[52] In a subsequent letter dated June 3, 2009, again in response to a request by Ms. Raymond, Ms. Bergman indicated that if the truck driving assignment was pure \u201cpin\u201d work, like the complainant\u2019s current job at HBC, he would be able to perform this work without accommodation.\n[53] Karen MacDonald, an Abilities Case Manager at Sun Life asked Sue Reid of SLH in March of 2007 if SLH could accommodate Mr. Douglas with light duty work but Sue Reid told her that they would only need truck drivers and warehouse people which did not fit Mr. Douglas\u2019 condition at that time. In June of 2007 SLH told Carmen LeFort that Mr. Douglas would not be hired back by SLH in any case. Carmen LeFort met with Mr. Douglas in May of 2008 to explore other work opportunities. She referred him to Banyan to assist him to find a new job and be trained, but after an initial contact when Banyan prepared its report on his functional abilities and transferrable skills analysis, the firm did not follow up with Mr. Douglas. SLH never expressed any interest in allowing Mr. Douglas to return to work after the letter of termination and despite contact by Sun Life as to whether job opportunities for Mr. Douglas\u2019 return existed.\n[54] SLH never attempted to assess Mr. Douglas\u2019 capabilities at any time after he left work on account of his right knee disability or post-surgery for purposes of re-employment nor did it make any effort to accommodate him in the work place through changes to truck driving or through retraining or through re-deploying him in other areas of its operation or through any modified work. Carmen LeFort told Sue Reid on May 6, 2008 that Mr. Douglas was participating in rehabilitation and was motivated to return to work and that she would continue to update Sue Reid. SLH responded that there was no job available for him.\n[55] Carmen LeFort who testified at the hearing was of the view that Mr. Douglas was always motivated to return to work at SLH. He obtained his own surgery date. He went to Cape Breton for the surgery. He and Lisa Gillis always kept in touch with Sun Life. Mr. Douglas always communicated to Sun Life his desire to return to SLH as he had done when he had his left knee surgery.\n[56] Mr. Douglas started to search for work outside of SLH after Ms. Bergman advised him in September of 2008 that his progress had \u201cplateaued\u201d and discharged him from physiotherapy. At about this time, Sun Life paid Mr. Douglas a lump sum of about $8,000.00 for the remaining unpaid LTD benefits up to March 23, 2009 and closed its file. With the help of Ms. Gillis he sent out applications with his resume to various employers for truck driving jobs. He eventually found his current job at HBC as a truck driver on a pure \u201cpin\u201d run starting on April 1, 2009.\n[57] Mr. Douglas admitted that his current job was \u201cperfect\u201d since it involves no lifting, loading or unloading and the pay is about the same as he was receiving at SLH. He admits that he can no longer do \u201cpeddle\u201d work because of the strain it would cause to his right knee. He also acknowledges that there is no pure \u201cpin\u201d work at SLH since all runs there involve some heavy lifting, loading and unloading. Nevertheless, he expresses the desire to be rehired at SLH either to do truck driving with the necessary changes and accommodations to suit his capabilities or to do dispatching. He feels that he could be trained to do dispatching even though he has no experience in that job.\n[58] Mr. Douglas believes that he has been discriminated against by SLH because of his physical disability. He feels that it was not his fault but rather the health system\u2019s lengthy surgery scheduling problems that cost him his job. There was evidence that even as late as April of 2009 Dr. Gross would not have had a surgery date for him, had he waited for Dr. Gross to do the surgery.\n[59] After Mr. Douglas was terminated, two new \u201cpeddle\u201d run truck drivers were hired. As well, two existing employees were moved into the dispatch operation. One became a full-time dispatcher in June of 2007 having been a part-time dispatcher. As well, a truck driver was hired to do part-time dispatching in March of 2009. There was a competition for a part-time position including a general and math skills aptitude test. The successful candidate has a University degree and scored the highest on the test.\n[60] Mr. Smith did not feel that Mr. Douglas had the qualifications to be a dispatcher. He felt that he did not have the leadership qualities to give direction to other employees as a manager, or the level of intelligence to deal with the various computer and math skills required to work out loading requirements and other related matters. He also did not feel that Mr. Douglas had the skills to deal with customers and employees under pressure situations which arose in dispatching.\n[61] SLH does not have any positions for truck drivers presently because of the downturn in the economy. According to Mr. Smith, uncontradicted evidence, no new drivers have been hired recently and, as a result of two departures, the truck driving ranks have been reduced instead of filling the vacancies.\n[62] Mr. Smith gave evidence that there was no equipment that could be safely used to accommodate Mr. Douglas in a truck driving position at SLH without heavy lifting to compensate for his physical restrictions. The equipment that SLH uses is the best that the industry has to offer in this regard and the various types of electric pallet jacks or forklifts on the market would be too heavy to store on a truck and could crash through loading ramps. They were therefore not a feasible means to accommodate a person such as Mr. Douglas in a truck driving capacity at SLH.\n[63] Mr. Smith admitted that had it not been for Mr. Douglas\u2019 right knee problems and his inability to come back to work within about six months while he was waiting for surgery, he would not have been terminated.\nIV. ISSUES [64] There are two issues that need to be determined in this case:\n(1) Has the Complainant demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability? (2) Has the Respondent provided a reasonable explanation that is not a pretext for discrimination?\nV. ANALYSIS\/CONCLUSIONS [65] A prima facie case is \u201cone which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent\u201d. That answer or explanation must be believed and not shown to be a pretext CHRC v. Canada 2005 FCA 154, para. 26. Once a Complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he is entitled to relief in the absence of justification by the Respondent. Ontario Human Rights Commission and O \u2019 Malley v. Simpson Sears [1985] 2 S.C.R. 36); Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd. 2004 FCA 204, at para. 18.\n[66] Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the burden of proof shifts to the Respondent to demonstrate that the alleged discrimination either did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory or justified. It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a complaint to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer\u2019s actions or decisions. Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.).\n[67] The Complainant\u2019s job as a truck driver was terminated by the Respondent while he was in the sixth month of a bonafide medical leave waiting to have surgery on his right knee. The reasons given by the Respondent for the termination were that the Complainant\u2019s absence from work was causing it to have operational difficulties in running its business and as a result of the Complainant not being at work and not being able to provide a definitive date for surgery or for his return to work, it had to terminate his employment and hire a full-time replacement. The Complainant did everything he could to try to get a surgery date. He had no control over the scheduling of his surgery. Other than paying for the cost of its share of his benefits, there were no employment or wage costs being incurred by the Respondent while the Complainant was on medical leave prior to his termination.\n[68] Accordingly, the Complainant has demonstrated a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of a disability.\n[69] The Respondent as its justification and explanation advanced the argument that it had relied on the information it received with respect to the Canada Labour Code in not terminating the Complainant until after twelve weeks had elapsed from the beginning of his medical leave. In that connection, s. 239 (1) of the Canada Labour Code provides as follows:\n\u201cPROHIBITION\n239.(1) SUBJECT TO SUBSECTION (1.1), NO EMPLOYER SHALL DISMISS, SUSPEND, LAY OFF, DEMOTE OR DISCIPLINE AN EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF ABSENCE DUE TO ILLNESS OR INJURY IF\nTHE EMPLOYEE HAS COMPLETED THREE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT BY THE EMPLOYER PRIOR TO THE ABSENCE; THE PERIOD OF ABSENCE DOES NOT EXCEED TWELVE WEEKS; AND THE EMPLOYEE, IF REQUESTED IN WRITING BY THE EMPLOYER WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS AFTER HIS RETURN TO WORK, PROVIDES THE EMPLOYER WITH A CERTIFICATE OF A QUALIFIED MEDICAL PRACTITIONER CERTIFYING THAT THE EMPLOYEE WAS INCAPABLE OF WORKING DUE TO ILLNESS OR INJURY FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, AND THAT THAT PERIOD OF TIME COINCIDES WITH THE ABSENCE OF THE EMPLOYEE FROM WORK. \u201d\n[70] The Code operates to protect employees. The above quoted section of the Code is a prohibition against an employer terminating an employee on medical leave prior to twelve weeks if he has three years of continuous service with the employer in cases such as this one involving a medical leave for a non-work related injury. The section is not paradoxically a licence to allow an employer to violate s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act in circumstances such as those that exist in this case. To find otherwise would be to render the Act subordinate to the Code, in spite of the fact that both of these pieces of legislation are designed to protect employees. Even if s. 239 (1) of the Code and s. 7 of the Act are to be viewed in conflict with each other, the Act has primacy as a quasi-constitutional piece of legislation. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia v. Heerspink, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 145, Winnipeg School Division No. 1 v. Craton, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 150, Canada (Attorney General ) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569, Canada v. Vaid 2005 SCC 30, at para. 81.\n[71] As such the Respondent has not provided a reasonable explanation or justification for its discrimination in terminating the Complainant\u2019s employment in this case.\n[72] Subsections (1) (a) and (2) of the Act provides for exceptions from what would otherwise be discriminatory practices as follows:\n\u201c15. (1) It is not a discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement;\nAccommodation of needs\n(2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1) (a) to be considered to be based on a bone fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1) (g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost. \u201d\n[73] The evidence was uncontradicted that at the time that the termination occurred several other truck drivers also on leave for medical reasons for periods considerably longer than the Complainant\u2019s leave were not terminated by the Respondent or questioned about when they might return to work, nor did the need to terminate them and hire full-time replacements come up. All of the evidence produced at the hearing respecting the Complainant\u2019s capability to do his former job post surgery or to be accommodated in some other position was ex post facto the termination and produced for the purposes of the hearing. At the time of termination, the Respondent did not, in any way, consider whether the Complainant could return to work after his surgery as he had done several years earlier following surgery to his left knee and as other employees were permitted to do without being terminated and replaced. Nor did the Respondent at the time of termination give any consideration at all to providing the Complainant with modified work or accommodating him in any way in the work place through changes to his job or other work opportunities.\n[74] As such, the provisions of s. 15 (1) (a) of the Act do not come into play in this case so as to except the conduct of the Respondent as a discriminatory practice.\nVI. DECISION [75] For the reasons set out above, I have determined that the Complaint has been substantiated.\nVII. REMEDIES [76] The Complainant has requested that I exercise my discretion to make an order including various of the terms under s. 53 (2) and (3) of the Act as set out below:\n53. (2) If at the conclusion of an inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n(c) that the person compensate the victim for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice; and\n(e) that the person compensate the victim, by an amount not exceeding twenty thousand dollars, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n(3) In addition to any order under subsection (2), the member or panel may order the person to pay such compensation not exceeding twenty thousand dollars to the victim as the member or panel may determine if the member or panel finds that the person is engaging or has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly.\n[77] On the facts of this case, it is not appropriate for me to exercise my discretion, pursuant to s. 53 (2) (b) to order the Respondent to rehire the Complainant. To do so would prompt him to leave his current job at HBC which he has described as being \u201cperfect\u201d and require the respondent to integrate him into a work place where there does not appear, on the evidence, to be any truck driving job that he can physically do or any other job that he is presently qualified to do or that is currently available to him. I am unwilling to risk the possibility that he may not be able to do any of the jobs at the Respondent after he has left his \u201cperfect\u201d job at HBC. The intention of the remedies under the Act is to make the Complainant whole for the rights that have been violated by the discrimination that has occurred. The effect of including in an order the term requested would be inimical to this purpose. Milano v. Triple K. Transport 2003 CHRT 30, at para. 63; OHRC V. Naraine 2001 CanLII 21234, paras. 68-74.\n[78] On the facts of this case it is not appropriate for me to exercise my discretion, pursuant to s. 53 (2) (c) to order the Respondent to compensate the Complainant for any lost wages since the Complainant did not incur any lost wages. The Complainant would not have been paid by the Respondent if he was not terminated unless he was actually working. While he was off on medical leave, the Complainant received essentially the same net amount of compensation through disability benefits as he would have had he continued in his prior job as a truck driver with the Respondent. His disability benefits concluded within a week of his finding new employment which provided him with the same or better compensation than he had received while working for the Respondent. In other words, had the Complainant not been discriminated against by being terminated while on medical leave he would either have (i) continued to be on medical leave receiving only the disability benefits that he received in the same fashion as had occurred when he was off several years earlier with his left knee disability; or (ii) he would have been returned to work at some point earlier than the end of March of 2009 and then would have been compensated by the Respondent but would not have received disability benefits which were essentially the same as the compensation he would have received from the Respondent.\n[79] On the facts of this case it is appropriate for me to exercise my discretion, pursuant to s. 53 (2) (e) to order the Respondent to pay the Complainant for pain and suffering experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. There was earlier in this Decision a review of the facts surrounding the aftermath of the Respondent\u2019s termination of the Complainant\u2019s employment after almost nine years of employment as he waited to obtain a surgery date for surgery to his knee. The sudden termination of his employment was a cruel blow to a person already suffering from the pain and difficulties of his injury and who had a history of anxiety problems. It caused him, for a considerable amount of time after the termination, to suffer anguish, depression and despair. He felt he had no job or employment future at a time he was not well and had debts on his newly purchased home to deal with. Accordingly, I hereby order the Respondent to pay the Complainant the sum of Fifteen Thousand ($15,000.00) Dollars pursuant to s. 53 (2) (e) of the Act.\n[80] On the facts of this case it is appropriate for me to exercise my discretion pursuant to s. 53 (3) to order the Respondent to pay the Complainant for having willfully terminated the Complainant while he was on medical leave contrary to s. 7 of the Act. Again, the facts already reviewed in this Decision indicate that while the Respondent claimed that it had no animus towards the Complainant its actions create another impression. The Complainant was clearly attempting to obtain a surgery date - something the Respondent was aware of. It is common knowledge that currently in Canada lengthy waiting times exist for non-critical surgeries. There was no evidence of any record of poor performance or misconduct by the Complainant in the past. The Respondent was not paying the Complainant wages while he was on medical leave so there was no real monetary loss for the Respondent in retaining the Complainant at least until it could determine whether the Complainant could return to work after surgery. The Respondent did not terminate other truck drivers for being on medical leave for periods significantly greater than the Complainant nor did it make any requests of them for information concerning their surgery schedule. Accordingly, I hereby order the Respondent to pay the Complainant the sum of Ten Thousand ($10,000.00) Dollars pursuant to s. 53 (3) of the Act.\nEdward P.

DECISION\nI. COMPLAINT A. Physical Disability and Family Status - Employment [1] The Complainant, Charles Breast, is a member of the Whitefish Lake First Nation #128 (Whitefish) situated 220 kilometers northeast of Edmonton Alberta. Mr. Breast has diabetes. For about 13 years he drove Whitefish's water truck and school bus. In January 2007, he experienced a loss of temporary vision in his right eye. He sought and obtained a leave from work. In late April 2007, Mr. Breast sought to return to work representing that his vision had returned to normal. Mr. Breast states that when he approached Whitefish staff to discuss his return to work, he was threatened and told that he was not welcome back. Since that time, Whitefish has requested specific medical information from him to allow it to return him to work. At the end of July 2007, Mr. Breast gave Whitefish a physician's note to support his desire to return to work. Whitefish then requested further medical particulars from him which Mr. Breast provided in July 2008. Shortly after receipt of the same Whitefish conditionally offered him a sewer truck driving job. Mr. Breast did not accept that offer.\n[2] Mr. Breast alleges that Whitefish discriminated against him on the basis of disability by failing to return him to work and by constructively terminating him. He also alleges that Whitefish discriminated against him on the basis of family status by giving his water truck driving job to the former chief's brother.\nII. FINDINGS OF FACT A. Findings in This Case (i) Medical Leave [3] Mr. Breast used to drive large trucks to haul water and often worked alone. He worked about 13 to 14 hours per day. The job included driving school buses occasionally. He used to drive the smallest to largest school buses transporting 20 to 60 children aged 15 to 16 years.\n[4] On January 8, 2007, he was completing a morning school bus run. After dropping children at school he returned home for lunch. Suddenly, he lost vision in his right eye without warning or symptoms. He contacted Whitefish staff and stated, There is something wrong with my eye....get someone else ...I cannot do it... He indicated that he could not drive any further until his vision returned.\n[5] Cleo Hunter was Mr. Breast's supervisor. Mr. Hunter was in charge of public works for Whitefish and supervised drivers. Shortly after January 8, 2007, when it became clear that Mr. Breast was not returning to work in the near future, he made arrangements for a relief driver to fill the position. Mr. Hunter telephoned Walter Houle and asked him to fill in as a relief water truck driver on a temporary basis. Water delivery was an essential service to Whitefish. In December 2007, Walter Houle had contacted Mr. Hunter and had told him that he would be available to work as a relief driver for Whitefish if and when needed. Walter Houle was the brother of the Chief at the time, Chief Tom Houle .\n[6] Concurrently, Mr. Breast contacted his physician, who referred him to a specialist. On February 8, 2007, Mr. Breast saw his specialist. The specialist confirmed that he had third nerve palsy arising from his diabetes. Diabetic third nerve palsy is a complication of poorly managed diabetes. It is the most common cranial nerve disorder in individuals with diabetes. Patients may complain of double vision that comes on suddenly, drooping of one eyelid, or pain in the head or behind the eye. There is no specific treatment to reverse the nerve injury. The main stay of the treatment is very tight control of blood glucose levels. Sometimes the eye is patched. Although many patients get better over time, some have permanent eye muscle weakness. The specialist could not advise Mr. Breast when his eye would heal. The specialist provided him with a one-line note stating due to a medical condition, Mr. Breast cannot operate a motor vehicle. There was no indication of the specific condition and whether it was a temporary or permanent condition. This note was dated February 8, 2007. Mr. Breast gave this note to Whitefish which then granted him a medical leave from work without an anticipated date for return.\n[7] Shortly after receiving this note, Mr. Hunter posted a notice for a two week period at Whitefish's office, Whitefish's two stores, and the health centre, seeking applicants for the position of water truck driver. He received only 1 application, being that of Walter Houle. As Walter Houle had been doing a good job hauling water on a temporary basis, Mr. Hunter hired him for the position. He did not consult the Chief and Council and made this decision himself. In the economic climate at the time, Whitefish was experiencing difficulties retaining and recruiting drivers for either the water or sewer truck. Mr. Hunter advised the Chief and Council of the hiring only after he had hired Walter Houle. At no time did the Chief or Council tell Mr. Hunter to hire Walter Houle.\n(ii) Medical Slip Required for Return to Work [8] By April 2007, Mr. Breast had regained his vision. At the end of April 2007, Mr. Breast told Mr. Hunter that he was ready to return to work, and Mr. Hunter told him that he had to get a Dr's ok indicating that he was fit to go back to work. Mr. Breast said he could not provide this to Whitefish because he had taken traditional healing. Mr. Hunter told him that there was a sewer truck driver position that was vacant, and that this job was open to him if he got a medical slip confirming that he could return to work. The salary and benefits of the sewer truck driver position and the water truck driver position were the same. The sewer truck position involved human waste and occasional exposure to unpleasant odour.\n[9] Mr. Breast was unhappy with this offer. On or about April 27, 2007, he telephoned Chief Houle, who at the time of the present hearing was a Whitefish Councillor. Mr. Breast told him that he wanted to return to work and that he could not get a medical slip because he was seeing a traditional healer. Chief Houle told him: Charles, you don't have to tell him you are seeing a traditional healer. You can go for a medical exam any time. Mr. Breast also told the Chief that Mr. Hunter had offered him a job as a sewer truck driver and that he was being demoted. The cellular telephone reception was poor during the call and at that point, the telephone reception cut off. Chief Houle went outside and telephoned Mr. Hunter. Chief Houle testified that he asked Mr. Hunter to advise him of the status of the water truck job because he was ... not up to speed with what was happening. Mr. Hunter told Chief Houle that we had posted the job and Wally's driving the truck. Chief Houle asked, Is there any other job we can give Charles? Mr. Hunter advised him that yes, there was an opening for a sewer truck driver position, conditional upon his obtaining a medical slip. Mr. Hunter indicated that as Mr. Breast had taken a medical leave, he had to provide a medical slip to return to work.\n[10] On the same day, Mr. Breast called a number of other Council members to try to return to work without a medical slip. He telephoned Councillor James Jackson, (who was Chief at the time of the present hearing). Mr. Jackson told him to bring in something to show that he was fit to work. Mr. Breast indicated that he had seen a traditional healer. Mr. Jackson referred him back to Mr. Hunter and Mr. Steinhauer, Whitefish human resources administrator, as Council did not get involved in individual employment issues. Mr. Breast then contacted Councillor Sandy Jackson regarding the same issues, and told him that he had taken traditional healing. Mr. Sandy Jackson testified that he told him to provide a medical certificate for a return to work as the Nation required a medical certificate.\n[11] During his leave, Mr. Breast was having financial difficulties at home. Sometime after his telephone call to Chief Houle, the Chief visited Mr. Breast's home to try to assist him. The Chief contacted a social worker, requesting assistance. The social worker told Chief Houle that the worker had followed the policy and there was no further assistance that could be offered to Mr. Breast. Chief Houle then gave him some money, in his words, to put some food on the table.\n[12] At some point in time, after April 26, 2007, Mr. Breast discovered that his water truck driving job had been given to Walter Houle, but he did not raise this with Whitefish as an issue of concern to him until he filed his complaint in January 2008. Mr. Breast himself was related to many people in the Whitefish community, including at least three Council members as of the date of the hearing. Whitefish staff consisted of about 130 employees, many of whom are Whitefish members. Many members and employees are related to other members or employees through blood or marriage.\n(iii) Contents of Required Medical Documentation for Return to Work [13] At the end of July, Mr. Breast gave Whitefish a medical slip dated July 27, 2007, written by his physician that stated in one line, This letter is to confirm that Mr. Charles Breast was fit for work duties as of April 26, 2007. Shortly thereafter, on July 31, 2007, Melvin Steinhauer sent Mr. Breast a letter enclosing a Form 17 being a Request for Medical Information. The Form 17 asked the physician to describe the nature of the employee's condition. The physician was also asked to describe any symptoms or characteristics of the condition that were expected to negatively affect the employee's ability to perform his or her regular work duties, and the employee's ability to provide regular attendance. It asked the physician to advise if, or to what extent, the symptoms or characteristics of the condition that interfere with the employee's job performance or attendance could be successfully managed or controlled through medication, treatment initiatives or other means. It sought the physician's prognosis of the employee's medical condition, whether it was permanent or temporary, and if it was likely to improve and when. It asked if the symptoms of the condition might worsen, and if so, to describe any anticipated further impact on the employee's ability to perform the job duties or attend at work. At the top of the form, the job in question was to be identified by the physician. The form also sought the physician's opinion regarding any specific initiatives (medication, treatment, workplace adaptation) that would enable the employee to successfully perform the essential duties of the position (including but not limited to, maintaining a level of attendance that enabled him or her to perform the essential duties). Finally, it sought any additional information that the physician felt may assist in attempting to successfully accommodate the employee in the workplace.\n[14] In the covering letter, Mr. Steinhauer requested Mr. Breast to provide the form to his physician along with a copy of the letter, so that Whitefish could obtain the information it needed to confirm that he was fit for work as a driver. The letter confirmed that this request was in accordance with its recently enacted employment policies. It also confirmed that once Whitefish had received medical information on the Form 17 indicating his fitness, Whitefish would reinstate him to active employment as a sewer truck driver with the same wages and benefits that he had received before his leave of absence.\n[15] In the same letter, Mr. Steinhauer confirmed that Mr. Breast had advised Whitefish that he had obtained traditional treatment and that Mr. Breast believed that he was ready to return to work. The letter outlined that one of the issues that led to his medical leave of absence was in relation to his difficulties in maintaining his blood sugar levels. In this last regard, Whitefish needed additional information from his physician about how that issue was presently being managed. Whitefish confirmed that the driver position was a safety sensitive position, and that Whitefish had to ensure Mr. Breast's safety as well as that of others, and address potential liability for Whitefish.\n[16] On July 31, 2007, Whitefish was in the process of enacting employment policies that covered accommodation issues. The policies and the Form 17 were officially approved by Whitefish Council on August 31, 2007. Under the policies, employees had an obligation to provide Whitefish with reasonable notice of any need for accommodation. Employees were also to provide a report from their physician with enough relevant information to allow the need for accommodation to be verified. In most cases, a completed Request for Medical Information Form 17 would be sufficient. Employees were to meet with the Human Resources Administrator to discuss accommodation options and to participate in these discussions in good faith. The policies stipulated that employees were required to accept reasonable accommodation.\n[17] On September 6, 2007, Mr. Breast sent to Alberta Driver Fitness a medical report confirming that his diabetes had stabilized. On September 7, 2007, Alberta Driver Fitness wrote to Mr. Breast that it had conditionally approved him to continue to drive a truck subject to an annual diabetic report and the wearing of adequate lenses. However, he did not give this letter to Whitefish.\n[18] On January 22, 2008, Mr. Breast filed the within complaint. Counsel for Whitefish made several requests after that date for a completed Form 17. On June 26, 2008, Whitefish again requested this information, and indicated that it was seeking to work with the Commission to resolve his complaint. Mr. Breast saw his physician and had the form completed on July 7, 2008, as it related to his position as a driver. Then the Commission forwarded it to Whitefish's lawyer on July 10, 2008. The Form 17 confirmed that Mr. Breast's diabetes was well controlled, that he had no lasting symptoms, and that the third nerve palsy had cleared up and his vision had returned. It confirmed that the nerve injury was a temporary injury and that the condition was not expected to worsen. In a section called adaptation, the form requested his physician to indicate if any specific initiatives to enable him to return to perform the essential duties of his position were required, and the physician indicated that none were required.\n[19] On July 16, 2008, Whitefish wrote to Mr. Breast and acknowledged receipt of the Form 17. It also confirmed that it had now received a copy of the letter from Alberta Driver Fitness conditionally approving his continued operation of a motor vehicle. Based on this information, Whitefish offered to reinstate Mr. Breast to the position of a sewer truck driver on the following four conditions. Mr. Breast was to:\ntest his blood sugar level daily and at least every four hours while on the job; not drive if he had low blood sugar levels and report any hypoglycemic condition to his supervisor immediately; keep an emergency food kit in the truck at all times; provide an annual medical and diabetic report required by Alberta Driver Fitness as part of his operator license conditions.\nThe letter was followed by a paragraph wherein Mr. Breast was to sign, indicating he was in agreement with the terms of the letter and accepted reinstatement on those terms.\n[20] Mr. Breast discussed the letter with his wife. He testified that he had no difficulty with any of these conditions, as he was already testing his blood twice a day, and would not drive if he had low blood sugar. Further, he always carried his lunch with him and complied with the conditions of Alberta Driver Fitness. Mrs. Breast testified that she implored her husband: Take that job...look at how we are living.\n[21] Accordingly, in late July 2008, he and his wife met with Melvin Steinhauer, to discuss his return to work. However, once Mr. Breast met Mr. Steinhauer in his office, he told him that Whitefish had no right to impose any medical conditions on him as only his physician could tell him what to do. Mr. Breast told him that he did not want the sewer truck driver position, and refused to sign the letter accepting the job. Mr. Steinhauer became upset as he had hoped that Mr. Breast had come to accept the job and the conditions. Mr. Breast also became upset. Mr. Steinhauer pointed and waved his finger at him and told him to cool down. Then Mr. Steinhauer thanked Mrs. Breast and the couple left his office.\n[22] At no time did Mr. Breast sign the letter accepting the sewer truck driving position on the outlined conditions.\n[23] In late August 2008, Mr. Breast filed a complaint under the Canada Labour Code, alleging that he had not received termination pay and severance pay from Whitefish as required by the Code.\nB. Agreed Facts and Access to Justice [24] Through active pre-hearing case management and exploration of the issues with counsel at the opening of the hearing, a number of facts were agreed to by both counsel. As well, the issues were narrowed to a few discrete ones. Prehearing conferences resulted in the shortening of a case anticipated to take 2 or more weeks to 1 week. The agreement of facts and narrowing of the issues at the inquiry further expedited the hearing such that it took 2 days of hearing time instead of the scheduled 5 days. Also, the medical evidence of Mr. Breast's family physician and specialist, and that of Whitefish's expert, Dr. Francescutti, was entered without the need to subpoena the physicians: the agreement to this effect resulted in savings to both parties of monies that would likely have been expended to cover the costs to have the physicians testify. The medical evidence was tendered for the truth of its contents and the parties waived their respective rights to cross-examine on the same. Through narrowing of the issues to only those in dispute, the parties agreed to curtail both the testimony of the witnesses and the argument.\n[25] Also, from the start of this hearing until the conclusion of the hearing, I had encouraged the parties to reach a settlement outside of the hearing process given that the complaint was lodged by a First Nation member against his First Nation. Unfortunately, a settlement was not reached. However, I acknowledge and thank both counsel for making attempts to facilitate a settlement throughout this hearing.\nC. Dispute over Factual Issues [26] In making the above findings of fact, I carefully considered all of the evidence. There was a discrepancy between the evidence of Mr. Breast, and that of the Whitefish witnesses and the documentary evidence. When there was a conflict between the evidence of Mr. Breast and the other evidence, I chose to rely on the latter for the following reasons:\n[27] Mr. Breast testified that he did not have a good memory of significant events. He could not explain discrepancies in dates and times, including those contained in his complaint. For example, his complaint is dated January 22, 2008; yet, it speaks to an event that occurred after this date: the complaint states that Mr. Breast took the Form 17 to his physician. In fact, Mr. Breast took the Form to his physician on or about July 7, 2008 who completed the form on July 7, 2008, being six months after the complaint date. Another more pertinent example is found in the complaint where he stated, My medical leave had nothing to do with my diabetes..., indicating instead that the reason for his leave was due to an infection in his left eye. This statement negatively affects his credibility, as Mr. Breast knew on the date of the filing of the complaint that his eye malfunction was due to third nerve palsy which resulted from his diabetes. On the first page of the complaint form, Mr. Breast has initialed beside the following statement: I have reasonable grounds for believing I have been discriminated against. I declare that the following information contained in my complaint is true to the best of my knowledge.\n[28] Mr. Breast testified that he did not advise Whitefish that he had obtained traditional treatment. This was contradicted by the testimony of Chief Houle, James Jackson, and Sandy Jackson. It was also contradicted by the written letter of Mr. Steinhauer, dated July 31, 2007, the accuracy of which Mr. Breast did not challenge after receiving it or at the hearing. Further, a finding that he did indeed advise Whitefish that he had taken traditional healing is rational and consistent with the other evidence. It explains the initial reason why Mr. Breast did not provide Whitefish with a medical slip from April 2007 to July 2007 for a return to work, and why his physician's slip of July 27, 2007 confirmed that he had been fit to return to work as of April 26, 2007. Initially, Mr. Breast did not think he could obtain a medical slip.\n[29] Mr. Breast testified that he could not remember if Form 17 was enclosed with the July 31, 2007 letter sent by Mr. Steinhauer. In light of the clear wording of the letter and the evidence of the other witnesses, I accept that the Form 17 was enclosed with that letter. I find that Mr. Breast was being inexplicably evasive with respect to a material issue in the hearing.\n[30] With respect to Mr. Breast's allegations that during their meeting of July 2008, Mr. Steinhauer tapped him aggressively three times on his forehead with his finger, I accept the testimony of Mrs. Breast over that of Mr. Breast, as I found her evidence to be more credible than his. She testified in his favour and could have exaggerated her evidence to his benefit, but did not. Her evidence was that Mr. Steinhauer waved his finger at Mr. Breast.\n[31] I also prefer the evidence of Chief Houle over that of Mr. Breast. I found Chief Houle to be a largely dispassionate witness, and someone who was, and remains, sympathetic to Mr. Breast. He bore no malice towards Mr. Breast: he tried to assist him and told him not to worry about not having seen a physician; that Mr. Breast could obtain the medical slip, even after the fact, to return to work. Chief Houle contacted Whitefish staff to find out the status of the water truck driver position, and if there were other employment opportunities for Mr. Breast. Chief Houle visited Mr. Breast's home to help him, and did help him financially, and tried to convince the social worker to help him. I found Chief Houle to be candid and direct. I found that he demonstrated sincere empathy towards Mr. Breast when he testified that he also used to drive a truck\u00b8 and that he was diabetic as well, and had to go for an annual medical examination. Accordingly, I accept the testimony of Mr. Hunter and of Chief Houle that Chief and Council were not involved in individual employment decisions, and that the Chief did not know in April 2007 that his brother was driving the water truck at this time in a permanent capacity.\n[32] Finally, I prefer the evidence of Mr. Hunter to that of Mr. Breast, as Mr. Hunter was direct and forthright, even when his evidence could have been seen as detrimental to Whitefish's case. For example, in cross-examination, he was asked if he knew about the Form 17 in April 2007. He candidly stated that he did not know about the Form 17 then, or subsequently, until Whitefish's lawyer told him about it in preparation for this hearing. He also acknowledged that other diabetic drivers were not required to submit a Form 17 although he did not clarify when this was the case and if other employees had taken a medical leave after July 2007. Thus, while this could have constituted damaging evidence to the Respondent's case, the evidence demonstrated that Mr. Breast was the first employee to receive the Form 17, close to the time of its enactment in July 2007. There was insufficient other evidence as to whether other employees, diabetic or not, had taken a medical leave and had sought a return to work, and thus ought to have been required to submit a Form 17.\nIII. LAW A. Establishing a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination [33] Section 7 of the Act legislates that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly, to refuse to continue to employ an employee, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Disability is included amongst the prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in s. 3 of the Act. According to s. 25, disability, for the purposes of the Act, means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug. Family status is also a prohibited ground of discrimination set out in s. 3.\n[34] In a human rights case before this Tribunal, the Complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a decision in favour of the Complainant, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. The Respondent's answer should not be considered in the determination of whether the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission) and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204). It has been held that the allegations made by the Complainant have to be credible in order to support a conclusion that a prima facie case exists (Dhanjal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37 at para. 6). When dealing with a course of conduct, as opposed to a pre-existing policy, one should start by examining whether the transaction between the parties, taken as a whole, results in adverse treatment on a prohibited ground (Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment) (C.A.), 2003 FCA 133, [2003] 4 F.C. 580).\nB. Defences [35] Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the Respondent to provide a reasonable explanation demonstrating that the alleged discrimination either did not occur as alleged, or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory or justified. (Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48, para. 4; CHRA, s. 15; see also Canada v. Lambie 1996 CanLii 3940 (F.C.)). It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a Complainant to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer's actions or decisions. (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.)).\n[36] If the Respondent wishes to avail itself of the bona fide occupational requirement justification, it must demonstrate that it met its duty of accommodation to the point of undue hardship further to s. 15 of the CHRA. The search for accommodation is a multi-party inquiry, and in the case of disability, the Complainant must facilitate the search for meaningful accommodation by responding to reasonable employer requests for relevant medical information regarding his or her limitations, in order to allow the employer to initiate a proposal (Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd. 2005 CHRT 8; Graham v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 40, paras. 91-94.) It is well accepted in the jurisprudence that an employee cannot dictate to an employer the precise terms of an accommodation. See for example, McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4. At para. 22 of this judgment, the Court noted that accommodation is not necessarily a one-way street, and that, when an employer makes a proposal that is reasonable, it is incumbent on the employee to facilitate its implementation. If the accommodation process fails because the employee does not co-operate, his or her complaint may be dismissed. The Complainant cannot expect a perfect solution. (See also, Hutchinson supra at para. 77). There is no duty of instant or perfect accommodation, only reasonable accommodation. The reasonableness of the employer's accommodation must be evaluated considering the knowledge of the employer, together with the cost, complexity and expense of any physical accommodation required, and other similar factors. (See Callan v. Suncor Inc., 2006 ABCA 15, para. 21)\nC. Evidence [37] The jurisprudence recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), discrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, there are rarely cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised. Rather, one must consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists the subtle scent of discrimination. Fundamentally, however, the Complainant must establish a link between his disability, and\/or family status, and the employer's decision to refuse to continue his employment (Mills v. Culp Transport Inc. 2009 CHRT 17). (See also Benoit c. Bell Canada, 2005 CF 926 at paras. 15-16).\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Family Status (i) Adverse Differential Treatment in the Course of Employment a) No Prima Facie Case Established and Reasonable Explanation Provided [38] Initially, Mr. Breast had argued that his water truck position was given to the Chief's brother because of that fraternal relationship. Accordingly, Mr. Breast argued that he had established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status. I do not agree. Other than the complaint's assertions, no other evidence was led suggesting that Walter Houle's relationship with the Chief at the time was a factor in the initial decision to hire him as a relief driver; nor, that it was a factor in the subsequent decision to hire him as a permanent water truck driver. Further, the evidence demonstrated that Mr. Breast himself was related to many people in the Whitefish community, including at least three Council members. While initially Mr. Breast suspected that Walter Houle had been hired without due process, his suspicions were not sufficient to establish the same. In accordance with the decision of McAdam v. Big River First Nation, 2009 CHRT 2 at para. 47, a complainant cannot simply put forward abstract beliefs or suspicions that he or she is a victim of discrimination without presenting some concrete observations or independent information to support or confirm that belief. (See also Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785 at para. 30-31).\n[39] In light of the foregoing, I do not find that the evidence led by Mr. Breast was complete and sufficient to establish a prima facie case on this ground (O'Malley).\n[40] Further, even if a prima facie case had been established, at the end of the hearing, Mr. Breast's lawyer, Mr. Stolfa, conceded in argument that Whitefish had established a reasonable non-pretextual explanation for the hiring of the Chief's brother. The water truck driver position supported an essential service; Whitefish needed to fill the position immediately. Further, after Walter Houle had served in the position of relief driver for a period of two weeks, Whitefish's solicitation of applicants for the position was advertised throughout Whitefish offices, and Whitefish received only Walter Houle's application for the position. The Chief and Council were not involved in the decisions to hire Walter Houle temporarily, and then permanently. Indeed, Whitefish was having a difficult time retaining and recruiting any drivers, for either water or sewer truck jobs.\nB. Disability (i) Adverse Differential Treatment a) Prima Facie Case Established [41] Mr. Breast suffered from a disability, being diabetes, and his return to work was predicated upon medical documentation surrounding the accommodation of this disability. One particular manifestation of his disability, being his diagnosis of diabetes-related third nerve palsy was a factor in Whitefish's decision as to whether and when to return him to work. I therefore find that Mr. Breast has established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability.\nb) Mr. Breast Failed to Facilitate the Accommodation Process (ii) Medical Information [42] Whitefish's requirement that Mr. Breast obtain medical information pertaining to his inabilities and limitations insofar as they affected his capacity to execute work as a driver, was a reasonable request and consistent with its duty of accommodation and, in particular, its duty to ensure his safety as an employee, and the safety of other Whitefish community members. The one-line medical note that Mr. Breast provided to Whitefish did not contain sufficient medical information to allow Whitefish to initiate a viable accommodation proposal. In the circumstances of this case, Mr. Breast had a duty to properly notify Whitefish of his physical abilities and limitations-a duty he did not fulfill.\n[43] Accommodation is a two-way street, and in this case I find that Mr. Breast failed to meet his obligation to cooperate in the accommodation process. He failed to provide the necessary medical information from July 2007 until July of 2008. It was the Commission, in July of 2008, that forwarded the medical information encompassed in Form 17 to Whitefish. Immediately thereafter, Whitefish proposed an accommodation plan which Mr. Breast himself testified he was comfortable with, as he was already adhering to the proposed practices in driving his own truck every day. He testified that he tested his blood twice a day, kept a lunch with him, adhered to the Alberta Driver Fitness driving license requirements, and would not drive if he had a problem with his blood sugar level. The accommodation plan was consistent with the opinion of Whitefish's expert physician specializing in community medicine. His report confirmed that Whitefish's plan for returning Mr. Breast to work, in an unsupervised environment, was consistent with the Canadian Medical Association Guidelines and Canadian Diabetes Association Guidelines for diabetic drivers.\n[44] Tellingly, as of the hearing date, Mr. Breast was still unwilling to sign the July 2008 conditional offer of reinstatement demonstrating that he was still unwilling to accede to the reasonable requests of Whitefish, and accept the position of sewer truck driver. As in the Tweten case, in this case, Mr. Breast failed to adequately participate in the search for accommodation, and ultimately failed to walk at all on a two-way street.\n[45] I considered whether the Form 17 requirement for a return to work was applied in an arbitrary fashion, and find that there was insufficient evidence to support such an allegation: i.e. I am unable to conclude, on the evidence, whether other employees, diabetic or not, had taken a leave and had sought a return to work and thus ought to have been required to submit a Form 17, but were not so required. While some witnesses testified in passing about the fact that Mr. Breast was the only person to have been required to provide a Form 17, and that they themselves had limited or no knowledge of the Form 17, sufficient evidence of the situation with respect to other members who left the employ of Whitefish for medical reasons, and who were then returned to work after July 31 2007, was not tendered.\na) Whitefish Offered Reasonable Accommodation - Alternate Vacant Sewer Truck Job [46] Mr. Breast asked me to find that Whitefish's offer to place him in the vacant sewer truck driving position was not reasonable as it was, in his submission, a job with lower status, and involved being exposed occasionally to an environment with bad odour. He argued that Whitefish offered him this job in bad faith, believing that he would not accept it. His arguments were difficult to follow, in that he testified that he never had a problem with taking this sewer truck job. When asked by his counsel as to whether the sewer truck driver job was of lower status, he could not confirm this. Further, in the hearing, he sought to be reinstated to the sewer truck driver job. Given that both positions had the same wages and benefits, even though the sewer truck position involved occasional odour, based on the evidence before me, I find that Whitefish provided a reasonable accommodation plan to accommodate Mr. Breast's disability. In these circumstances, his refusal to take the vacant sewer truck job in lieu of his water truck driver position was not reasonable, and he could not hold out for his preferred prior job. He failed to facilitate the accommodation process.\n(iii) Termination of Employment a) No Prima Facie case established [47] Mr. Breast argued that he was constructively terminated from his position: that based on his meeting with Melvin Steinhauer in late July 2008, the job of a sewer truck driver, as outlined in Whitefish's letter of July 16, 2008, was not open to him. Mr. Breast argued that in spite of the clear wording of the letter, when Mr. Steinhauer allegedly tapped him on the forehead with his finger, this constituted non-verbal communication to Mr. Breast that the sewer truck job was not available to him, and that he was not welcome to commence work. I do not accept this argument, as I have found for the reasons outlined above, that Mr. Steinhauer only pointed and waved his finger at him. I have also found that the sewer truck job was open to Mr. Breast from the spring of 2007 until this hearing, irrespective of the events that unfolded in the July 2008 meeting; specifically, it was open to Mr. Breast, from the spring of 2007 until this hearing, to communicate to Whitefish that he wished to take the sewer truck driver job. From July 16, 2008, he had simply to sign Whitefish's formal offer and return it to the Whitefish office. From the date of his receipt of the letter of offer, Mr. Breast did not accept this offer. I do not find that he was terminated by Whitefish, constructively or otherwise.\n[48] Whitefish's counsel argued that the preliminary determination of compliance by an inspector with respect to Mr. Breast's Canada Labour Code complaint demonstrates that he was not constructively terminated. However, in deciding this case, I place no weight on the preliminary determination of the Canada Labour Code inspector.\nV. DECISION [49] For these reasons, I dismiss the complaint, as it has not been substantiated. I have considered the evidence, both discretely and collectively, and find no discrimination within the meaning of section 7 of the CHRA.\nOriginal signed by Shirish P.

Conclusion\n[1] The Complainants were all at one time employed by the Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSSRB), an agency that was replaced by the Public Service Labour Relations Board (PSLRB) on April 1, 2005. While the Treasury Board of Canada (Treasury Board) is the employer for most federal public servants, the PSSRB had, since 1968, been a separate employer of its staff.\n[2] In 1999, the Treasury Board agreed to make payments to its federal public service employees who had been employed in the Clerical and Regulatory (CR), Library Science (LS), Secretarial, Stenographic and Typing (ST), Personnel Administration (PE), and Data Processing - Conversion (DA-CON) occupational groups, among others. These payments were made in relation to several human rights complaints that had been filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) between 1984 and 1991. Those complaints alleged that differences were being maintained between the wages of male and female employees who were performing work of equal value, within the same establishment, a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), commonly referred to as the pay equity provision of the Act.\n[3] The Complainants claim that they have held positions at the PSSRB in occupational groups with the same classifications as those referenced in the s. 11 complaints. However, the Complainants did not receive the same pay equity payments, specifically the sums representing wages owed retroactively for the period ranging between 1985 and 1999. The Complainants allege that by not extending these payments to them, the Treasury Board and the PSSRB discriminated against them, in breach of ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA.\n[4] In the following decision, I first set out the factual background of the case, describing how the PSSRB came to be designated a separate employer. I then proceed to explain how a number of pay equity adjustments paid to employees of the core federal public service over the years were ultimately extended to PSSRB employees as well, with the notable exception of the above mentioned 1985 to 1999 retroactive payments that form the basis for the present complaint. In my analysis of the case, I ultimately determine that the complaint has not been substantiated.\nI. Factual Background [5] The parties filed a fairly extensive Agreed Statement of Facts in this case, and it forms the basis for most of the facts recited in this decision.\nA. The establishment of the PSSRB and its relationship with the Treasury Board [6] In order to understand what led to the filing of this complaint, it is important to consider the organizational history of the PSSRB and its relationship with the Treasury Board.\n[7] The PSSRB was established in 1967 with the enactment of the Public Service Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 (PSSRA), to serve as an independent quasi-judicial tribunal mandated by Parliament to administer the collective bargaining and grievance adjudication systems in the federal public service. Pursuant to the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 33 (2nd Supp.), it was also given a similar mandate in respect of the employees of the institutions of Parliament. In 2005, the PSSRA was repealed and the PSSRB was replaced by the PSLRB in accordance with the Public Service Labour Relations Act, S.C. 2003, c. 22, s. 2.\n[8] The PSSRB was funded through appropriations made by Parliament that came through the Treasury Board. The Treasury Board is a committee of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada (i.e., a Cabinet committee) established by s. 5 of the Financial Administration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-11 (FAA). It is comprised of the President of the Treasury Board, the Minister of Finance and four other members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada. Providing assistance to the Treasury Board is the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS), a government department consisting of a Secretary appointed by the Governor in Council together with officers and employees.\n[9] The Treasury Board was responsible for the management of personnel in the departments, agencies, boards and commissions listed in Part I of Schedule I of the PSSRA, commonly referred to as the core public service. This list was wide-ranging and included, as of 1984 for instance, entities such as the Privy Council Office, Statistics Canada, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the Canadian Labour Relations Board and the CHRC. The Treasury Board's powers in relation to personnel management were enumerated in s. 11(2) of the FAA, and included the classification of positions and the determination of wage rates, work hours and leave entitlements.\n[10] The authority of the Treasury Board over personnel management did not extend to personnel working in the agencies, commissions and boards listed in Part II of Schedule I of the PSSRA, identified as separate employers. According to s. 11(2) of the FAA, the exercise by the Treasury Board of its powers in relation to personnel management was subject to the provisions of any enactment respecting the powers and functions of a separate employer. The group of separate employers encompassed, for example, the National Film Board, the Atomic Energy Control Board, the Office of the Auditor General of Canada and, of particular relevance to this case, the PSSRB.\n[11] According to s. 12(2) of the FAA, responsibility for the management of personnel of separate employers could be delegated by the Governor in Council, to the minister of the Crown responsible for the agency or the minister's deputy, or to the separate employer's chief executive officer.\nB. How did the PSSRB come to be a separate employer? [12] In the first year following its inception in 1967, the PSSRB formed part of the core federal public service. Accordingly, the Treasury Board was responsible for the management of the PSSRB's personnel, including the classification of positions and the determination of wage rates, work hours and leave entitlements.\n[13] On July 8, 1968, the Chairperson of the PSSRB, Jacob Finkelman, wrote to the Treasury Board Secretary, requesting that the PSSRB be exempt from the personnel management powers of the Treasury Board. Mr. Finkelman pointed out that certain parties appearing before the PSSRB had begun questioning its independence and objectivity, due to the fact that the Treasury Board was the main employer falling within the PSSRB's jurisdiction. The Treasury Board Secretary was sympathetic to these concerns but proposed, as an alternative solution to the complete exemption sought by Mr. Finkelman, that the PSSRB become a separate employer. This proposal was ultimately implemented and thus, on October 28, 1968, the Governor in Council designated the PSSRB as a separate employer under the PSSRA (P.C. 1908-2302), pursuant to s. 5 of that Act, and authorized the PSSRB Chairperson (P.C. 1968-18\/1998) to exercise and perform the powers and functions of the Treasury Board in relation to employees of the PSSRB, effective November 1, 1968, pursuant to s. 12(2) of the FAA.\n[14] Although the PSSRB had been designated as a separate employer, in regard to staff relations, its situation was different in some respects from that of other separate employers regarding staff relations. PSSRB employees were excluded from collective bargaining, under the PSSRA. Consequently, while many other separate employers negotiated wage rates with the bargaining agents of their employees, the PSSRB was in a position to unilaterally set the terms and conditions of employment, including wage rates. Therefore, in furtherance of the authority he acquired by order-in-council to perform the functions and powers of the Treasury Board, Mr. Finkelman simply directed that the terms and conditions of employment of the core public service would apply mutatis mutandis to PSSRB employees, effective November 1, 1968.\n[15] As a result of Mr. Finkelman's directive, the PSSRB effectively adopted for each of its occupational groups the same pay scales that were established through the collective bargaining process in the core public service for those occupational groups. Yvon Tarte, who chaired the PSSRB and subsequently the PSLRB between 1996 and 2006, was called as a witness by the CHRC. He testified as to his understanding of why Mr. Finkelman issued this directive. Given the PSSRB's role as a neutral arbiter of complaints arising from collective agreements, it would have been inappropriate for the terms of employment of the PSSRB's staff to either lead or follow those of the employees who were subject to its jurisdiction. In this manner, neither unions nor employers who appeared before the PSSRB would be able to support their respective positions by pointing to similarities with or differences from the pay scales and other employment conditions of PSSRB employees.\n[16] The PSSRB was facilitated in its decision to adopt the Treasury Board pay scales by the fact that the PSSRB had, in regard to most of its employees, applied many of the same job classification standards for its staff as those set by the Treasury Board for the core public service, a practice that began at its inception in 1967 and continued until its dissolution in 2005, with respect to most PSSRB employees. The evidence does show, however, that the PSSRB had used at least five classification groups that were not in common with those used in the core public service. Mr. Tarte testified that during his tenure, the PSSRB considered developing its own complete system of classification standards, and hired a consultant to conduct some preliminary studies into the matter. The PSSRB did not ultimately go through with its adoption, due in part to resistance by some managers regarding the resources required to effect the change, as well as concerns that the change may impede the PSSRB's employees' ability to move into other positions within government. Mr. Tarte pointed out, however, that although it made it easier for PSSRB employees who wished to move within the federal public service to have the same classification as the jobs being advertised, such mobility would not have been impossible had the classification system been different. Methods existed for the determination of comparable classification when conducting staffing actions.\n[17] Mr. Tarte added that the degree of employment mobility enjoyed by the PSSRB's staff, as things stood, was acceptable. PSSRB employees could participate in competitions that were internal to the public service (both within the core and amongst separate employers). A special arrangement had been struck with smaller agencies, whereby the pool for some competitions would be limited to these agencies. Mr. Tarte explained that some of these agencies were separate employers, while others came within the core public service.\n[18] Mr. Tarte was asked to compare the work performed by PSSRB employees whose jobs were classified within the CR group with the work performed by CRs in the core public service. He testified that based on his experience in the public sector, the work of CR employees at the PSSRB was basically the same as that performed by CR employees in the core public service. He admitted, however, that his assessments were only based on his personal observations. He did not conduct any formal comparative assessment of CR employees, nor does he hold a degree in human resource management or have any expertise in job evaluation.\n[19] One of the Complainants, Richard Harkin, was employed as the PSSRB's librarian between 1985 and 2002. He testified that he had occasion to write the job descriptions of several of the PSSRB's CR-level employees whom he supervised. As evidence of the similarity in the work performed by these CRs with those employed in the core public service, he recalled that in preparing these job descriptions, he relied upon the Treasury Board classification standards and consulted the job descriptions of CRs employed in libraries of departments and agencies belonging to the core public service.\nC. The 1984 pay equity complaints regarding the core public service [20] In 1984, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC) complained to the CHRC that the Treasury Board, as the employer of the core public service, had discriminated against members of the female-dominated CR occupational group of the core public service, contrary to ss. 7 and 11 of the CHRA. The complaint alleged that the CR employees were being paid lower wages than those paid to members of the male dominated PM (program administration) occupational group who were performing work of equal value, within the same establishment. Section 11(1) provides that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between male and female employees in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value.\n[21] The Commission held the 1984 complaint in abeyance pending the outcome of a Joint Union Management Initiative on Equal Pay for Work of Equal Value (JUMI) undertaken by the TBS in cooperation with eight bargaining agents, including the PSAC, in March 1985.\n[22] The employees of the separate employers, including those of the PSSRB, were not parties to the complaint, and the complaint did not contain any allegation that separate employers, including the PSSRB, discriminated against their employees in the CR occupational group contrary to s. 11 of the CHRA.\n[23] The JUMI was directed by a joint committee (the JUMI Committee) that agreed to conduct a study to determine the degree of sex discrimination under s. 11 of the CHRA and devise methods of system-wide correction in order to eliminate sexually based wage disparity.\n[24] Using data of March 1985, the JUMI Committee ultimately identified nine (9) female dominated and fifty-three (53) male-dominated occupational groups, as defined in the Equal Wages Guidelines, 1986, (SOR\/86-1082) (Guidelines), in respect of s. 11 of the CHRA, in that portion of the public service for which the Treasury Board represented the employer. The JUMI Committee agreed that these occupational groups would comprise the parameters of the study. The Guidelines had been issued by the CHRC pursuant to its power under s. 27(2) of the CHRA to issue guidelines setting out the extent to which and the manner in which, in its opinion, any provision of the Act applies in a class of cases.\n[25] The JUMI Committee agreed to use a job evaluation plan to evaluate positions from male and female dominated occupational groups using a representative sample of positions. The sample size was 3,185 positions. The job evaluation process, including the gathering of job data, commenced in the fall of 1987 and concluded in the fall of 1989. Questionnaires were sent out to employees occupying positions included in the sample. The questions were aimed at assessing the skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions of the positions sampled. The answers given by the employees were reviewed by their supervisor and signed to confirm the accuracy of the answers.\n[26] The positions sampled were evaluated by evaluation committees set up by the JUMI Committee. The JUMI study broke down in 1990. Several phases of the study had been concluded by then, but a final determination as to the degree of wage disparity and any recommendations had not been reached yet.\n[27] Nevertheless, on January 26, 1990, the President of the Treasury Board, the Hon. Robert De Cotret, rose in the House of Commons to announce that although the final phase of the study had not been completed, the Government had concluded that any further determinations that might be made would not be significant enough to prevent it from taking action to immediately implement some corrective measures. He therefore declared that unilateral pay equity wage adjustments would be made to members of the CR and ST occupational groups for which the Treasury Board was the employer.\n[28] These equal pay adjustments or equalization payments paid to employees of the CR and ST occupational groups consisted of:\nA lump sum retroactive payment, for the period starting April 1, 1985, and ending March 31, 1990, to be paid in accordance with the time the employees were employed in the CR and ST groups during the retroactive period; and\nOngoing annual salary adjustments effective April 1, 1990, for employees in the CR and ST group.\nD. The impact of the 1990 adjustments on the PSSRB and other separate employers [29] On February 28, 1990, representatives of the separate employer agencies, including the PSSRB, met with TBS officials and advised them that because of the close relationship between the core federal public service's and the agencies' rates of pay, the employees of the agencies and their bargaining agents were exerting pressure to obtain similar equalization adjustments as the employees of the core public service. The Treasury Board's initial response was that given the agencies' separate employer status, the Treasury Board would not provide funding for any salary adjustments.\n[30] An internal report prepared within the PSSRB following up on this meeting concluded that two options were available to the PSSRB - either petition the Program Branch of the Treasury Board for an increase in budget to pay the PSSRB's staff pay adjustments similar to the core public service, or have the PSSRB conduct its own internal pay equity study. The report pointed out that if an internal study resulted in salaries being adjusted to levels below those of core public service employees, the PSSRB risked having dissatisfied employees.\n[31] Despite the TBS's refusal to fund salary adjustments for separate employers, on March 23, 1990, the Chairperson of the PSSRB at the time, Ian Deans, issued a memo to the staff of the PSSRB informing them that he had decided to approve equal pay adjustments for CR and ST employees commensurate with those being given by the Treasury Board to core public service employees in those occupational groups. Mr. Deans underscored, however, that these payments to PSSRB employees were conditional on receiving the necessary funds from the Treasury Board, pursuant to a submission that he had made to that effect.\n[32] Apparently in response to the requests of the PSSRB and other separate employers, the Treasury Board eventually modified its position on the salary adjustments. On June 15, 1990, the Treasury Board informed Mr. Deans and other separate employers that it would authorize separate employers to make ongoing annual relativity payments to employees of the CR and ST occupational groups equivalent to the annual equalization payments being made by the Treasury Board to employees of the CR and ST groups in the core public service. However, this authorization came on condition that the individual separate employers conduct a pay equity study within each of their organizations. The ongoing payments were to cease when the separate employer completed its own pay equity study, or on March 31, 1992, whichever was earlier. In granting this authorization to the separate employers, the Treasury Board explicitly stated that its consideration in making this decision was to maintain an approximation of salary relativities between the core public service employees and the staff of separate employers. The Treasury Board stated that its objective was not to authorize adjustments representing equal pay for work of equal value.\n[33] The Treasury Board's decision did not apply any differently to the PSSRB than to other separate employers. Mr. Deans disagreed with this uniform approach and he made his views known in a letter that he addressed to the Treasury Board Secretary on June 20, 1990. He argued that the PSSRB's status was distinct from that of other separate employers. He pointed out that the PSSRB was the only separate employer whose employees were barred from collective bargaining and that as a result, since its inception in 1967, the classification standards of the core public service were consistently applied to the positions established by the PSSRB.\n[34] Mr. Deans added in his letter that pay scales and benefits established through the collective bargaining process in the core public service were also consistently applied to the PSSRB's employees. He argued that it was essential for the PSSRB to assign the same terms, conditions and benefits to its employees as to the core public service, in order to prevent any party before it from using the PSSRB as an example during the resolution of a dispute. Mr. Deans concluded that for these reasons, the PSSRB had historically followed in lock-step the classification and compensation plan of the core public service, and that accordingly, its pay equity relationships must be considered to exist within the context of that universe. He therefore advised the Treasury Board that he intended to adjust the salaries of the PSSRB's CR and ST occupational groups to conform with those authorized by the Treasury Board for its employees in these groups. This presumably would have included the retroactive payments as well.\n[35] On August 20, 1990, Mr. Deans wrote again to the Treasury Board Secretary, contending that the equal pay adjustments, including the retroactive portion, that were being paid to CR and ST employees in the core public service, had disrupted the historical relativity between PSSRB employees and the core public service. He added that the fact that PSSRB employees had not received similar adjustments on an indefinite basis had had a disastrous effect upon their morale and that this would impair the PSSRB's ability to recruit and retain competent staff. Mr. Deans claimed that it is artificial in the extreme for the Treasury Board to argue that PSSRB employees would only be entitled to pay equity adjustments beyond 1992 if it was found that inequities existed between male and female dominated occupational groups within the PSSRB. He asserted that it could not be seriously argued that pay scales that are based upon discriminatory rates of pay in the core public service are not themselves tainted by the discrimination.\n[36] It should be noted here, however, that in an earlier memo to PSSRB staff (July 20, 1990), Mr. Deans had indicated that PSSRB management had conducted an informal internal comparison of male and female dominated occupational groups within the PSSRB, which had not revealed the existence of any internal pay equity problem.\n[37] Mr. Deans further advised the Treasury Board Secretary in his August 20th letter that despite the TBS's position, he intended to restore pay relativity to the PSSRB's CR and ST employees (presumably on an indefinite basis), by forwarding a submission for funding approval directly to the members of the Treasury Board.\n[38] On August 29, 1990, the PSSRB submitted a Briefing Note to the Minister (i.e. the President of the Treasury Board), setting out the same arguments that Mr. Deans had previously raised with the Treasury Board Secretary and requesting approval of the PSSRB's submission for the allotment of funding required for the payment of a relativity allowance.\n[39] These efforts appeared to have had some impact on the TBS and, on September 15, 1990, the Treasury Board Secretary advised Mr. Deans that the TBS staff had been asked to re-examine the PSSRB proposal for the allotment of funding. On November 1, 1990, the Treasury Board wrote to Mr. Deans and other heads of separate employer agencies, acknowledging that many of those agencies had made representations to the Treasury Board seeking approval for the funding of retroactive (lump sum) adjustment payments. The Treasury Board was now informing them of its decision to permit the making of these payments on condition that each employer launch initiatives within its own organization to eliminate differences in wages, if any, in compliance of s. 11 of the CHRA. Consequently, on Novemer 6, 1990, Mr. Deans approved the implementation of the revised rates of pay, including both the retroactive payments and the ongoing salary adjustments.\n[40] The evidence indicates that although the PSSRB did not ultimately ever conduct an internal pay equity study, it continued and never ceased paying the ongoing relativity adjustments, beyond the deadline of March 31, 1992, which the Treasury Board had set down in its June 15, 1990, letter to Mr. Deans and the other separate employers.\nE. The 1990 PSAC Human Rights Complaint [41] In February 1990, the PSAC had filed a second s. 11 complaint with the CHRC against the Treasury Board alleging that the results obtained through the JUMI process demonstrated that employees of six (6) female-dominated occupational groups earned lower wages than those earned by the employees of the fifty-three (53) male-dominated occupational groups included in the study performing work of equal value.\n[42] The six (6) female-dominated groups named in the complaint were the CR, ST, DA-CON, LS, Educational Support (EU), and Hospital Services (HS) occupational groups. The PSAC also alleged that the equalization adjustments to the CR and ST groups announced by the Treasury Board President in January 1990 were insufficient to correct the breach of s. 11. The PSAC sought compensation for the affected employees for all direct and indirect losses since March 8, 1984.\n[43] On October 6, 1990, the CHRC referred a portion of the PSAC's 1984 complaint (the allegation of the violation of s. 11 of the CHRA) as well as the entirety of the 1990 complaint, to the Tribunal for determination. The Tribunal ultimately concluded, in its decision dated July 29, 1998, that the Treasury Board had engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 11 of the CHRA and ordered the Treasury Board to make payments in respect of its employees of the CR, ST, DA-CON, LS, HS and EU occupational groups in the core public service in accordance with the terms set out in the order. These payments consisted of:\nAnnual lump sum equalization payments for the period from March 8, 1985, to July 29, 1998, to be calculated using the 1987-88 job evaluation data from the JUMI study and the contemporary wage rates for the applicable fiscal year, (i.e. retroactive payments); and\nPay equity adjustments for wages for periods after July 29, 1998, which were to be folded into and become an integral part of wages (i.e., ongoing payments).\n[44] The Treasury Board applied for judicial review of the Tribunal's order, but on October 19, 1999, the Federal Court dismissed the judicial review application with costs. On October 29, 1999, the representatives of the TBS and the PSAC concluded an agreement for the purpose of implementing the Tribunal's decision of July 29, 1998. The terms of the agreement were ultimately incorporated in a Consent Order issued by the Tribunal and dated November 16, 1999.\nF. To what extent were separate employers involved and affected by the 1984 and 1990 PSAC complaints? [45] In its complaints filed with the Commission in 1984 and 1990, the PSAC did not name any of the separate employers, including the PSSRB, as respondents. In the particulars of the complaints filed by the PSAC with the CHRC in 1984 and 1990, there is no allegation that separate employers, including the PSSRB, discriminated against their employees in the CR, ST, DA-CON and LS groups within the meaning of s. 11 of the CHRA or any other provision of this statute.\n[46] The parties in the present case all concur that the JUMI study was neither intended to, nor did it apply to employees of separate employers. There were no separate employer representatives on the JUMI Committee. Separate employers did not have any input in the choice of the job evaluation system selected by the JUMI Committee to evaluate positions or any input into how the job evaluation system was modified. No positions of employees of separate employers were included in the population that was sampled for the JUMI study and no such positions were evaluated by the evaluation committees for skill, effort, responsibility and working conditions (which are the four criteria set out in s. 11(2) of the CHRA). There were no management representatives from any of the separate employers on any of the fifteen evaluation committees.\n[47] The Tribunal's decision of July 29, 1998, and the Consent Order of October 29, 1999, only applied to employees of the departments, agencies, boards and commissions listed in Part I of Schedule I of the PSSRA, that is, those portions of the public service for which the Treasury Board was the employer. The decision and the Consent Order did not apply to employees of separate employers.\n[48] On July 28, 1998, just prior to the release of the Tribunal's decision, the Secretary of the Treasury Board had written to all separate employers to advise them that the ruling would apply only to that part of the public service for which Treasury Board is the employer and that it did not automatically extend to separate employers.\n[49] On November 16, 1999, the Secretary of the Treasury Board wrote to all separate employers again, reiterating that the original complaint by the PSAC, the Tribunal ruling of July 29, 1998, and the Consent Order applied only to that part of the public service for which the Treasury Board is the employer and not to separate employers.\n[50] This position was repeated by TBS officials at a meeting for separate employer representatives hosted by the TBS on January 21, 2000. While the TBS officials indicated that no retroactive payments would be made to the separate employers, they offered and agreed to consider requests for salary relativity adjustments on a case by case basis based on the amended rates of pay for Treasury Board employees, and to consider requests for pay equity adjustments based on pay equity studies conducted by separate employers within their own establishments. The TBS undertook to continue providing technical support and advice to separate employers that carried out reviews of their respective pay equity situations.\n[51] On February 25, 2000, Mr. Tarte, who had replaced Mr. Deans as PSSRB chair in 1996, wrote to the Assistant Secretary of the TBS. Mr. Tarte submitted that the PSSRB's situation was different than that of other separate employers and that consequently, the TBS should reconsider its position that the Consent Order did not apply to the PSSRB. Mr. Tarte advanced arguments that were similar to those put forward by Mr. Deans back in 1990 when he sought to reverse the TBS's position on the funding to the PSSRB for relativity payments. Mr. Tarte reiterated that the PSSRB was distinct from other separate employers, highlighting the fact that its employees were precluded from collective bargaining, as well as the operational necessity for the PSSRB not to adopt wages and benefits for its staff that differed from those provided to core public servants. Mr. Tarte submitted that due to these circumstances, PSSRB staff formed part of the group that was subject to the pay equity order. He posited that since the PSSRB was paying its staff wages identical to those that had been found by the Tribunal and the Federal Court to be discriminatory, then it was unsupportable to contend that the PSSRB's wages were not discriminatory as well.\n[52] Mr. Tarte also affirmed in his letter that given the traditional relativity that had been maintained with the core public service for the terms and conditions of employment, including rates of pay, there was no reason for the PSSRB to undertake a pay equity study of its own. At the hearing into the present complaint, Mr. Tarte testified that in his view, conducting a separate pay equity study would have been a futile exercise and a waste of money, as it would not have proven the existence of wage discrimination within the organization. He added that he had been advised at the time that some of the female dominated occupational groups referenced in the PSAC's pay equity complaints were either neutral or male dominated within the PSSRB. Mr. Tarte testified that for him, the key issue in this dispute with the TBS was fairness. It was simply inequitable that given the special circumstances of the PSSRB, its employees not receive the same treatment as core public servants employed within the same occupational groups.\n[53] On July 10, 2000, the TBS replied to Mr. Tarte's February 25th letter, advising him that in its determination, no valid grounds existed to justify the extension of the Consent Order to PSSRB staff. The TBS maintained that the PSSRB was no different than other separate employers and as such, was a separate establishment, within the meaning of s. 11 of the CHRA and s. 10 of the Guidelines. The TBS reiterated its undertaking that it would support the PSSRB if it opted to conduct its own pay equity study. If the study determined that its pay rates were discriminatory, the TBS would be prepared to consider and analyze any requests for additional funding, should the PSSRB be unable to remedy the discriminatory practice from its existing financial resources.\n[54] Mr. Tarte testified that aside from these communications in writing with the TBS, he had engaged in numerous conversations with TBS representatives regarding the matter, but their position was always unyielding.\n[55] In light of the TBS's July 10th letter, Mr. Tarte issued a memo to PSSRB staff on July 28, 2000, in which he advised that in spite of the PSSRB's numerous efforts, he was sorry to inform them that the TBS had refused to give PSSRB employees the right to the provisions of the pay equity agreement made between the Treasury Board and PSAC.\n[56] It would seem, however, that the Treasury Board later reversed its position in part, by authorizing and providing funding to the PSSRB solely for the adjustment of the ongoing rates of pay for its CR, ST and LS occupational groups, based on the post-July 29, 1998 amended rates of pay for the Treasury Board employees. No evidence was led before me to explain how or why this change came about.\n[57] As a result of this adjustment, the only respect in which the remuneration of PSSRB employees in those occupational groups has differed over the years from that of Treasury Board employees employed in the core public service is in relation to the lump sum retroactive equalization payments for the period from March 8, 1985, to July 29, 1998. It was to address this differentiation as well as the one regarding the retroactive payments for PE employees, discussed below, that the present human rights complaint was filed.\nG. The pay equity complaints involving the PE occupational group [58] Between 1991 and 1994, several complaints were filed with the CHRC against the Treasury Board, alleging that it was paying lower wage rates to employees in the predominantly female Personnel Administration (PE) occupational group than employees in five predominantly male occupational groups who were performing work of equal value in the same establishment, a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 11 of the CHRA. The complaints pertained only to employees classified in the PE occupational group in the portion of the public service referred to in Part I of Schedule I of the PSSRA (i.e., the core public service). Since the employees classified in the PE occupational group were excluded from collective bargaining, the PE National Assembly or PENA was constituted to represent the interests of the PE employees for the purpose of the complaints.\n[59] The PE occupational group was not part of the JUMI study. Rather, the TBS and the PENA undertook a joint study to examine the allegations of pay inequity raised in the pay equity complaints filed with the CHRC.\n[60] Based on the results of the study, the parties settled the complaints on November 26, 1999, pursuant to a memorandum of agreement concluded between the PENA and the TBS. The settlement provided an increase in the rates of pay effective October 1, 1999, and the payment of a retroactive lump sum to the affected employees for the period October 1, 1991, to September 30, 1999.\n[61] The settlement applied to former and current PE employees who were in a department or agency listed in Part I of Schedule I of the PSSRA (i.e., the core public service) during the relevant time, commencing on October 1, 1991.\n[62] These pay equity complaints did not allege that the employees of separate employers occupying positions classified in the PE occupational group were victims of discrimination. Separate employers did not participate in the PE study undertaken by the TBS and the PENA, nor did they have any input in the choice of the job evaluation system or in the manner in which it was applied. No positions from separate employers formed part of the study. Employees of the separate employers, who were occupying positions classified in the PE occupational group were not parties to the settlement, nor did they receive any compensation under the settlement in respect of their employment with separate agencies. However, the PSSRB made a request, and was ultimately authorized, to adjust the rates of pay for its PE occupational group to match the amended rates of pay for the core public service employees, effective October 1, 1999. On the other hand, the Treasury Board did not authorize funding for the payment of any retroactive sums to persons employed in the PSSRB as PEs between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1999.\nH. Mr. Harkin's expectations regarding equalization payments [63] As I indicated earlier, one of the 66 complainants, Richard Harkin, was the PSSRB's librarian from 1985 to 2002. He was the only complainant to testify at the hearing. His position came within the LS occupational group. He testified that in 1979, the PSAC filed a human rights complaint with the CHRC against the Treasury Board, alleging that core public service employees employed within the LS occupational group, comprised primarily of women, were receiving wages that were lower than the wages earned by a male dominated comparator group that was performing work of equal value. In 1980, a settlement was reached, according to which an additional sum (identified as an equalization payment) was to be paid annually to LS employees. The settlement was incorporated into the collective agreement between the PSAC and the Treasury Board.\n[64] When Mr. Harkin was hired by the PSSRB in December 1985, his offer of employment indicated that his salary had been determined in accordance with the Public Service Terms and Conditions of Employment legislation, which Mr. Harkin understood to be the wage rates and other conditions negotiated by the PSAC with the Treasury Board regarding core public service employees. In addition, the offer of employment stated that the LS equalization adjustment formed part of his rate of pay. Mr. Harkin testified that he continued to receive the LS equalization payment throughout the course of his employment at the PSSRB as an LS, despite the fact that the foundation for this payment was an agreement that had been reached between the PSAC and the Treasury Board, to which the PSSRB was not a party.\n[65] According to Mr. Harkin, this practice further demonstrated that the PSSRB employees' salaries were always in lock-step with the core public service. He testified that given the PSSRB's uninterrupted payment to him of the LS equalization payments during his tenure, he reasonably assumed the same practice would be adopted if any further equalization payments were ordered or consented to with respect to core public service librarians. Thus, when he learned that his employer would not pay him the retroactive payments arising from the 1999 Consent Order, he felt as if his employment contract, dating back to December 1985, had simply been shredded to pieces.\nI. The present complaint [66] On November 27, 2001, Mr. Harkin, along with 65 other PSSRB former or current employees, reacted to the decision not to provide them the retroactive payments by filing the present complaint against the Treasury Board and the PSSRB, alleging a breach of ss. 10 and 11 of the CHRA. After the CHRC referred the complaint to the Tribunal, the Complainants abandoned the s. 11 component of the complaint and on February 18, 2009, the Tribunal allowed them to amend the complaint to include s. 7 as an additional alleged discriminatory practice.\n[67] This was not the first complaint ever launched by PSSRB employees regarding wage discrimination. In April 1991, 32 employees filed a s. 11 complaint against the Treasury Board and the PSSRB alleging that the predominantly female CR and ST occupational groups at the PSSRB were being discriminated against on the basis of sex, as their salaries were lower than those paid to the male dominated groups. The complaint alleged that the Treasury Board and the PSSRB were the same employer, and that the employees of the core public service and the employees of the PSSRB were employed in the same establishment. This complaint was dismissed by the CHRC on December 19, 1994, on the basis that, for pay equity purposes, the PSSRB and the Treasury Board are not part of the same establishment and, as such, the conditions required by s. 11(1) of the CHRA had not been met.\nJ. How have other separate employers dealt with the pay equity issue? [68] Over the years, some of the separate employers have examined their compensation practices for compliance with pay equity principles. For example, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and the Medical Research Council conducted their own pay equity studies. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service, the Social Science and Humanities Research Council, the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR) and the OSFI implemented gender-neutral classification plans to deal with the matter of pay equity. The PSSRB, as I already mentioned, never conducted any pay equity study of its own.\nII. Analysis [69] In the adjudication of human rights complaints, the complainant must first typically establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley)). A prima facie case, in this context, is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to provide a reasonable, non-discriminatory explanation for the impugned conduct.\n[70] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors influencing the respondent's conduct (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para 7 (F.C.A.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (T.D.)).\nA. Has a prima facie case been established? [71] The CHRC and Mr. Harkin, speaking on behalf of the other complainants, argued that this case is essentially a matter of fairness. From their perspective, it is unfair that clerks, administrative assistants and librarians, for instance, who worked in the core public service, received retroactive pay equity adjustments, while PSSRB staff working in jobs that were similarly classified, did not.\n[72] However, the precise question with which this Tribunal is actually seized is not whether the denial of these payments to the Complainants and other PSSRB employees was fair, but whether the decision to deny the payments constituted a discriminatory practice under ss. 7 or 10 of the CHRA. I will first deal with s. 7 and leave my consideration of s. 10 for later.\nB. Section 7 of the CHRA [73] Section 7(b), which is the relevant portion of s. 7 that has been invoked by the CHRC and the Complainants in this case, states that it is a discriminatory practice to directly or indirectly, in the course of employment, differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination. What is the alleged adverse differentiation in this case? In answer to this question, the CHRC submitted that the 66 complainants were all employed in female dominated jobs or occupational groups and that their wage rates had been found to be depressed compared to the wages of male dominated occupational groups. They had therefore been underpaid. In essence, the CHRC contends that persons employed at the PSSRB in female dominated jobs were paid less than persons employed in male dominated jobs for doing work of equal value.\n[74] But what evidence has been led to establish that the wages were depressed? Ordinarily, complaints alleging this form of discrimination are brought under s. 11 of the CHRA, which provides that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer to establish or maintain differences in wages between male and female employees employed in the same establishment who are performing work of equal value. This appears to be the type of discrimination alleged by the Complainants in this case, to the effect that the CR, ST, LS and PE occupational groups employed at the PSSRB should be considered to be female jobs, that these female jobs are undervalued to male jobs with the result that those individuals employed in the female jobs (including men, such as Mr. Harkin) are entitled to a wage adjustment as a remedy.\n[75] The Complainants originally alleged a breach of s. 11 in their complaint, but after the CHRC referred the complaint to the Tribunal, they abandoned their claim under this provision. No reason or explanation was given for this decision. We know, however, that no comparative study of the female and male dominated groups within the PSSRB to assess the value of the work performed by these employees, in accordance with the criteria and definitions set out in s. 11 and the Guidelines, was ever conducted. Thus, the sort of evidence ordinarily led in such cases was not available. Why was such a study not initiated in this case? Mr. Tarte, whom the CHRC called as a witness, testified that he had been advised that a pay equity study would not have proven the existence of wage discrimination at the PSSRB within the meaning of s. 11. Dr. Nan Weiner, whom the CHRC called to testify as an expert in pay equity principles, among other topics, stated that in her opinion there were not enough male dominated occupational groups within the PSSRB to compare to female dominated groups in a pay equity study. On the other hand, an expert in job evaluation in the pay equity context, Bob Bass, who was called to testify by the Respondent, stated that there were sufficient job classes with unique enough functions at the PSSRB to conduct a pay equity study.\n[76] Whatever the reason may have been for not engaging in such a job evaluation exercise, given the absence of this form of study, there was no evidence available to support or substantiate a claim of wage discrimination pursuant to s. 11, had such a complaint been made.\n[77] The CHRC argues, however, that nothing in the CHRA prevents it from establishing that this type of wage discrimination has occurred by means other than those contemplated in s. 11. The CHRC proposes what on its face appears to be a simple method for establishing that the Complainants' wages were depressed and undervalued. It asks the Tribunal to consider what took place within the core public service. After all, contends the CHRC, the Complainants were in jobs with the same classifications and were receiving the same salaries as the s. 11 complainant group in the core public service. Consequently, if the core public servants' salaries were depressed, the PSSRB's must be too.\n[78] This argument cannot stand, in my view. The outcome of the Consent Order and the PE Settlement was not that the salaries of the occupational groups in issue were inherently discriminatory because they were female dominated or comprised of what has traditionally viewed by society as female work, but rather as the result of a pay equity exercise as contemplated by s. 11 of the CHRA. A pay differential between male and female dominated groups of employees doing work of equal value employed in a single organization can only be found to be discriminatory, within the meaning of the CHRA, if it is has been determined to be so pursuant to an assessment of the work done in accordance with the definitions and criteria articulated in the CHRA and the Guidelines. The pay differential is not inherently discriminatory under the federal legislative framework, it is only determined to be so once the exercise contemplated by s. 11 and the Guidelines has been completed.\n[79] In the present case, the core public service's wage rates were only found to be discriminatory following a pay equity study conducted in accordance with the precepts of s. 11, one of which is that the alleged discrimination relate to a single establishment. As the Respondent points out, Parliament chose to limit an employer's obligation to ensure equal pay for work of equal value among men and women to the employer's establishment. Under the Guidelines, an establishment is constituted of all employees of the employer subject to a common personnel and wage policy. It was on this basis that in April 1991 the CHRC determined, in dismissing the complaint filed by 32 PSSRB employees, that the PSSRB constitutes a separate establishment from the core public service. In the early 1980's, the CHRC had made a similar decision with respect to another separate employer, the National Research Council, a decision that was upheld by the Federal Court of Canada (Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, A-844-81 (FCA), motion for leave to appeal to the SCC denied [1983] S.C.C.A. No. 452).\n[80] Dr. Weiner suggested in her evidence that since, in her opinion, there were insufficient male comparators within the PSSRB to conduct a study following the method contemplated in s. 11 and the Guidelines, it would be legitimate to use another method, such as relying on the comparisons to male occupational groups that had been made pursuant to s. 11, in the context of the JUMI study and ultimately, the Consent Order. This exercise could be accomplished by comparing the female PSSRB jobs directly to the male jobs in the core public service or alternatively, by conducting a surrogate or proxy comparison. This latter approach is suited to highly female oriented organizations where there are insufficient male comparators. These female jobs would be compared to female dominated jobs in a proxy organization that had sufficient male comparators and where pay equity has already been achieved. If the female jobs from both organizations are found to be of equal value then the wages of the seeking organization should be adjusted to be the same as well. Apparently, Quebec's and Ontario's pay equity legislative schemes explicitly permit the use of this approach in certain circumstances.\n[81] Dr. Weiner's suggestions, however, do not accord with the regime that is in place at the federal level. Section 11 and the Guidelines prescribe an internal analysis based solely on the assessments of work performed by employees employed within the same establishment. External surrogate or proxy comparisons are not contemplated therein.\n[82] Dr. Weiner's proposal, however, begs the question of whether a complaint of unequal pay for work of equal value can be resolved under ss. 7 or 10, rather than s. 11, by calling upon an analysis or methodology that is not contemplated in s. 11, such as the ones advanced by her.\n[83] In my view, it cannot. As was noted in the final submissions of the Respondent, in enacting s. 11, Parliament sought to identify and ameliorate wage discrimination that resulted from the undervaluation and underpayment of women's work as compared to men's work. In the Federal Court decision regarding the 1990 PSAC complaints (Canada (Attorney-General) v. Public Service Alliance of Canada, [2000] 1 F.C. 146 (T.D.)), the Court pointed out that the mischief at which s. 11 is principally aimed is the existence of a wage gap that disadvantages women, as a result of gendered segregation in employment and the systemic undervaluation of the work typically performed by women (see also Canada (Attorney-General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490 at para. 90).\n[84] Parliament specifically dealt with this issue in s. 11 and articulated the means by which this form of discrimination is to be determined. If a party perceives that it is unable to prove the undervaluation and underemployment of women's work by the means set out in s. 11, can it under the guise of the general CHRA provision for employment related discrimination (s. 7 (b)), establish its existence through the use of another pay equity method than that which was contemplated in s. 11, such as a proxy or surrogate analysis? Not in my opinion, as this approach would be at variance with the explicit intent of the legislator that complaints of unequal pay for work of equal value be resolved having resort to the analysis provided in s. 11.\n[85] I agree with the Respondent's submission that this construction is supported by the rule of statutory interpretation generalia specialibus non derogant, more commonly known as the implied exception rule. According to the rule, where there is a conflict between a statutory provision that deals specifically with the matter in question and another provision that has a more general application, the conflict is to be resolved by applying the specific provision to the exclusion of the more general one. It is evident that Parliament has specified the method by which pay equity is to be determined at the federal level. To depart from this method and import others, even though some of these methods may have been adopted by some provinces, would be inappropriate in my view.\n[86] A similar issue was dealt with by the Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan in University of Saskatchewan v. Dumbovic, 2007 SKQB 182, in relation to provincial human rights legislation. The Court noted that while Saskatchewan has legislation requiring equal pay between male and female employees for equal work and for similar or substantially similar work, there is no specific provision in any provincial Act requiring equal pay for work of equal value. The complainant women in that case consequently filed a complaint under the general discrimination provision (s. 16(1)) of the Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (Code), which stipulates that no employer shall discriminate against a person or class of person with respect to employment on a prohibited ground. This provision is similar to s. 7(b) of the CHRA. The Court held that the Saskatchewan Human Rights Tribunal lacked the jurisdiction under s. 16 of the Code to hear complaints of unequal pay for work of equal value.\n[87] The Court referred to the complex structures necessary to implement, administer and enforce a regime of equal pay for work of equal value, citing some of the conclusions and findings from the final report of Pay Equity Task Force, Pay Equity: A New Approach to a Fundamental Right - (Ottawa: Public Works and Government Services Canada, 2004). The Court pointed out that the introduction of pay equity structures into the Code would raise issues of incompatibility with other provincial legislation and took note of the Task Force's recommendation that pay equity legislation should contain specific criteria, structures, methodologies and processes. The Court concluded that these latter components of a pay equity analysis could not be created by a statutory interpretation of s. 16's general terms. Focussed legislation is required.\nThe Court went on to add, at para. 108, that:\nAdjudicators must understand the difference between interpretation and application of the law, on the one hand, and creation of the law, on the other. In this case, the legal and regulatory structures necessary to implement, administer and enforce a regime of equal pay for work of equal value in Saskatchewan workplaces can only be created by appropriate legislation. Any attempt to construct them under the guise of interpreting subsection 16(1) of the Code would go well beyond acceptable limits of statutory interpretation. It would intrude into the role and responsibility of the legislature.\n[88] While I am mindful that this decision related to a question of the provincial human rights tribunal's jurisdiction rather than an exercise in the interpretation of a statute, as in the present case, I think the Court's reasoning can be extended by analogy to efforts aimed at introducing into the CHRA, by means of s. 7, alternate forms of pay equity analysis than those contemplated in s. 11 and the Guidelines.\n[89] The CHRC argued that Parliament's intent to require that complaints of unequal pay for work of equal value be dealt with solely under s. 11 is not necessarily as obvious as the Respondent contends. The CHRC referred to the recently enacted Public Sector Equitable Compensation Act, S.C. 2009, c. 2, s. 394 (PSECA), pursuant to which the PSLRB was assigned the jurisdiction to deal with claims involving equitable compensation within the public sector. The transitional provisions of the Act provide, at s. 396(1), that any of the following types of complaints that may have been pending before the CHRC prior to the coming into force of the Act shall be referred by the CHRC to the PSLRB:\nComplaints based on s. 7 or 10 of the CHRA, if the complaint is in respect of the employer establishing or maintaining differences in wages between male and female employees; and Complaints based on s. 11 of the CHRA.\n[90] The CHRC contends that by grouping all three CHRA provisions together in this fashion, Parliament demonstrated its intent that matters of pay equity can be addressed under any or all of these CHRA provisions. I do not agree. The first paragraph does not make reference to differences in wages between male and female employees who are performing work of equal value.\n[91] As was pointed out in Dumbovic at para. 86, gender-based wage discrimination can arise in other forms as well. For instance, paying unequal wages to male and female employees who are doing identical work would constitute adverse differentiation with the meaning of s. 7(b). Paying males and females differently for the performance of similar or substantially similar work may also constitute a discriminatory practice under s. 7(b). This situation arises where employees have different job titles but perform substantially the same work. For instance, in Walden (previously cited), a predominantly male group of medical advisers (or doctors) who worked alongside a predominantly female group of medical adjudicators (or nurses), in the administration of the Canada Pension Plan Disability Program, were found to be performing the same or substantially similar work. Yet, only the medical advisors were classified as health professionals, which enabled them to receive the additional benefits and recognition that flow from that designation.\n[92] These forms of gender-based wage discrimination must be distinguished from claims of unequal pay for work of equal value, which are established through an assessment of the relative value of jobs based on specific criteria. Federally, the framework for making these assessments is articulated in s. 11 of the CHRA and the Guidelines.\n[93] In addition, the Respondent proffered that the terms of PSECA's transitional provision may also be indicative of Parliament's intent to have all s. 11 complaints (including complaints that have invoked s. 7 or s. 10, as well) dealt with entirely by the PSLRB, rather than having the Canaidan Human Rights Tribunal run a parallel process to deal with the ss. 7 and 10 components of a complaint relating to the same set of facts.\n[94] In either instance, I am not persuaded that the PSECA and its transitional provisions have any impact on my finding that Parliament's intent was and remains that human rights claims alleging the discriminatory practice of unequal pay for work of equal value be resolved solely through the application of s. 11 of the CHRA.\n[95] The CHRC referred in its arguments to the principle that human rights laws are to be given a large and liberal interpretation to ensure that the objects of these laws are attained. This principle is intended, however, to apply where there are ambiguities in the Act (Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employers Association, 2003 SCC 36 at para. 26). In my view, there is no ambiguity present here. Parliament has stated its method for determining the existence of unequal pay for work of equal value through its enactment of s. 11, and the ensuing issuance by the CHRC of the Guidelines, as contemplated by the CHRA.\n[96] The CHRC advanced an alternate argument for establishing that the Complainants had been adversely differentiated within the meaning of s. 7 (b). The result of the Consent Order and the PE Agreement was that the wage rates of certain female dominated occupational groups within the core public service were underpaid. They were thus earning female wages. Knowing that PSSRB staff in jobs that are similarly classified were being paid the same female wages, the PSSRB and, more importantly, the Treasury Board, should have addressed their minds to the great likelihood that PSSRB employees were being subjected to the same discrimination. According to the CHRC, the Treasury Board's failure to rectify this discrimination by approving funding for the retroactive equalization payments constitutes adverse differentiation on the basis of sex.\n[97] I fail to see how the PSSRB's and the Treasury Board's failure to consider or address their minds to the possibility raised by the CHRC constitutes adverse differentiation. The Complainants were not receiving inherently discriminatory female wages. Under the CHRA, the determination of whether unequal wages are being paid for work of equal value is made pursuant to s. 11 and the applicable Guidelines. Dr. Weiner testified that she disagrees with the federal scheme for pay equity, and in her preferred methodology, a wage should be deemed to be female if by ordinary societal norms, the job attached to the wage is considered female. This may be a legitimate and appropriate method for conducting a pay equity analysis, but it is inconsistent with the approach articulated in the CHRA and the Guidelines.\n[98] The fact is that the PSSRB was a separate employer pursuant to the PSSRA and the FAA, as well as a separate establishment within the meaning of s. 11 of the CHRA, as the CHRC itself so determined in 1991. The Consent Order and the PE Agreement did not apply to the PSSRB. I am not persuaded by the argument that the separate employer's alleged failure to consider the likelihood that its pay scales are also discriminatory constitutes adverse differentiation on the basis of sex. There certainly was differentiation on the basis of where the complainants worked (at the PSSRB rather than in one of the core public service's departments or agencies). Employees employed at the PSSRB ended up earning wages that did not incorporate a retroactive adjustment that employees in the core public service received. This may seem unfair, but it does not demonstrate that the Complainants were adversely differentiated on the basis of sex.\n[99] Besides, the Treasury Board did address its mind to the possibility of a pay equity problem by recommending that separate employers, including the PSSRB conduct their own pay equity studies, undertaking to support them in these efforts and ultimately, being willing to consider funding any requests for wage adjustments arising from these studies.\n[100] In its final submissions, the CHRC highlighted numerous indicators in the evidence suggesting that the Treasury Board should be considered the effective employer of the PSSRB's staff, including the Complainants. After all, the jobs of most (but not all) PSSRB employees were classified according to the Treasury Board's classification standards and Mr. Tarte testified that he felt the PSSRB's CRs did similar work to CRs in the core public service. Personnel bulletins issued by the PSSRB that were filed in evidence directed that job classification decisions within the organization were to be made according to the classification standards in use in the core public service. The Complainants' salaries moved in lock-step with those of core public servants, including the 1990 relativity payments and the 1980 LS equalization payments. Staffing actions at the PSSRB were subject to the Public Service Employment Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33, just as those in the core public service. PSSRB staff could transfer in and out of positions in the core public service with relative ease. The Treasury Board exercised control over the release of funds to the PSSRB and other separate employers, which effectively meant that the Treasury Board controlled the separate employers' wages. Historically, but for the need to maintain the PSSRB's neutrality, as first expressed by Mr. Finkelman, the PSSRB would have remained part of the core public service and never become a separate employer. In sum, the CHRC contends that the Treasury Board exercised de facto control over the personnel management of the PSSRB. The CHRC therefore argued that, as Mr. Tarte had stated in his February 25, 2000, letter to the TBS, even if the PSSRB is a separate employer and not a party to the human rights complaints, the PSSRB employees formed part of the group that was subject to the Consent Order.\n[101] However, irrespective of whether or not the de facto employer is the Treasury Board, I fail to see how this alters or impacts on my earlier findings regarding the application of s. 7 (b) to the present case. Whether the employer is the PSSRB, the Treasury Board, or as the CHRC also pointed out, ultimately Her Majesty the Queen, the fact remains that discrimination at the PSSRB in the form of unequal pay for work of equal value has not been established using the methodology that Parliament has chosen, as articulated in s. 11 of the CHRA.\n[102] I made no distinction between the roles of the PSSRB and the Treasury Board in my previous discussion regarding the s. 7 (b) claim, and any findings are essentially interchangeable between the two possible employers, regarding the issue of whether a prima facie case of discrimination under s. 7 (b) can be made in the circumstances alleged in this complaint.\n[103] Besides, even if the Treasury Board is considered the employer of both the PSSRB and the core public service, the PSSRB still constitutes a separate establishment from the core public service within the meaning of s. 11, as the CHRC had already found back in 1991. As I have already discussed, the PSSRB's wage scales cannot be automatically determined to be discriminatory based on the pay equity study and findings of distinct entity or establishment, the core public service.\n[104] The suggestion that PSSRB employees are de facto Treasury Board employees may perhaps support the argument that they are directly entitled to receive the retroactive equalization payments set out in the Consent Order and the PE Agreement in their capacity as Treasury Board employees. This, however, would be a question of execution of the Tribunal Order or non-compliance with the PE Settlement. The means for dealing with such matters is to have the Tribunal Order or the PE Settlement filed with the Federal Court, and thereby render them orders of the Court, as provided for in ss. 48(3) and 57 of the CHRA.\n[105] For all the above reasons, I find that even if the allegations and evidence of the Complainants and the CHRC are believed, a prima facie case of adverse differentiation within the meaning of s. 7(b) has not been established.\nC. Section 10 of the CHRA [106] Section 10 (a) of the CHRA, which is the portion of s. 10 that is relevant to the Complainants' allegations, provides that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer or employer organization, to establish or pursue a policy or practice that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. The CHRC's submissions regarding s. 10 (a) were predicated on the assumption that the Complainants were earning discriminatory wages, adding that the discriminatory wages were paid in furtherance of a policy or practice established by the PSSRB and\/or the Treasury Board. For the reasons that I have given with respect to the s. 7(b) allegation of discrimination, I have found that the allegation that the wages paid by the PSSRB constituted adverse differentiation, and thereby discriminatory under the CHRA, has not been established. On this basis alone, therefore, the s. 10 (a) claim cannot be established, even on a prima facie basis.\n[107] In addition, however, I am not persuaded that any evidence has been led to support the claim that the Complainants were denied an employment opportunity, even if it was established that they were paid in an adversely differential manner based on their sex. The CHRC argued that had the Complainants known that they would ultimately not have received the same retroactive adjustments to their salaries as the core public service thereby denying them an equitable wage, they could arguably have chosen not to remain in the employ of the PSSRB and sought employment within the core public service instead, in order to maintain an equitable salary. Given the relativity and equalization payments provided in the past to the PSSRB's LS, CR and ST employees, it was reasonable for the Complainants to expect that any future adjustments awarded to core public servants would apply to them as well.\n[108] This argument, however, is entirely hypothetical. No evidence was led of any PSSRB employee for whom the presumption of pay relativity was a factor in their decision not to seek employment in the core public service. Furthermore, even if such evidence had been adduced, I am not convinced by the CHRC's argument that an employee's decision not to seek other employment for the reasons alleged would deprive or tend to deprive the employee of an employment opportunity within the meaning of s. 10. However, given the above mentioned absence of evidence supporting the s. 10 allegation, I need not comment any further on this latter point.\n[109] For these reasons, I find that a prima facie case of a discriminatory practice pursuant to s. 10 has also not been established.\nIII. Conclusion [110] I therefore conclude that the complaint has not been substantiated and it is consequently dismissed.\nSigned by Athanasios D.

Lustig\n[1] This is a ruling concerning a complaint by beachesboy@aol.com against HBoss.\n[2] A complaint was filed on July 15, 2005. It alleges that the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant and others on the basis of sexual orientation by repeatedly communicating through AOL Canada message boards, messages which would likely expose homosexuals to hatred and\/or contempt contrary to section 13(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. The alleged conduct occurred from on or about February 16, 2005 to on or about June 6, 2005.\n[3] The complaint was referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal on August 30, 2007. On November 29, 2007, the Commission provided to the Tribunal, as per Rule 4(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, contact information with respect to the parties.\n[4] The Tribunal's initial letter requesting the parties' position regarding mediation was issued to all parties on December 19, 2007. The Complainant and the Commission responded in favor of mediation.\n[5] The Tribunal's initial letter of December 19, 2007, which was sent by courier to the Respondent, was returned on January 14, 2008 marked UNCLAIMED. The same letter was then sent again to the Respondent on January 23, 2008 by regular mail but was returned to the Tribunal on February 6, 2008 marked MOVED.\n[6] On February 11, 2008, the Tribunal requested from the Commission an alternate address for communications for the Respondent. No alternative address was provided.\n[7] On June 5, 2009, the Tribunal requested that the Commission provide further particulars as to the Respondent's address. As at November 20, 2009 the Tribunal had not been provided with these particulars.\n[8] On November 20, 2009, the Tribunal instructed the Commission to serve on the Complainant and file with the Tribunal, on or before November 27, 2009, particulars as to contact information with respect to the Respondent and to make submissions on whether the matter should proceed. The instruction of the Tribunal indicated that the Complainant would then have until December 4, 2009 to serve on the Commission and to file with the Tribunal written submissions on whether the matter should proceed.\n[9] On November 25, 2009, the Commission wrote to the Tribunal advising that the Respondent could not be located and that all attempts to do so had been fruitless. The Commission noted that no further objectionable material had been brought to the attention of the Commission since 2005. The Commission's letter went on to say that its opinion was that it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the complaint. It also submitted that, in light of all the circumstances, the complaint should be dismissed.\n[10] On December 10, 2009, the Tribunal corresponded to the Complainant by forwarding the Tribunal's letter of November 25, 2009 asking for a response thereto by December 14, 2009. No response was provided.\n[11] It does not appear that any of the parties are interested in continuing to participate in this matter. Accordingly, the complaint is hereby dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P. Lustig\nOTTAWA, Ontario May 19, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: T1252\/6407\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: BEACHESBOY@AOL.COM v.

Lustig\n[1] This is a ruling concerning a motion by the Respondent dated September 4, 2009 for an adjournment of this matter sine die.\n[2] The complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant on January 29, 2007. The complaint alleges that the Respondent communicated messages over the internet that were likely to expose members of the Jewish community to hatred or contempt by reason of their membership in an identifiable group contrary to s. 13 (1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA). The complaint alleges that the impugned conduct occurred in a manner that was ongoing.\n[3] On September 16, 2008, the Commission, pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of CHRA requested the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) to institute an inquiry into the complaint.\n[4] On September 2, 2009 the Tribunal released its decision in the matter of Warman v. Lemire, 2009 CHRT 26. That case involved a complaint under s. 13 (1) of the CHRA. In his very comprehensive decision, Member Hadjis concluded:\n... I have also concluded that s. 13 (1) in conjunction with ss. 54 (1) and (1.1) are inconsistent with s. 2 (b) of the Charter, which guarantees the freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression. The restriction imposed by these provisions is not a reasonable limit within the meaning of s. 1 of the Charter.\n[5] On October 1, 2009, the Commission applied to the Federal Court for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision in Warman v. Lemire (See FC file no. T-1640-09).\n[6] In its public release commenting on its application for Judicial Review dated October 1, 2009, the Commission commented as follows:\nThe Commission applied for Judicial Review so that technical but important legal issues raised by the decision can be clarified. These issues go beyond this particular case and could have an impact on other administrative tribunals. As a result, the uncertainty created by the decision is not in the public interest and merits a binding decision by a higher court.\nThe application is based on two grounds. It is the Commission's view that:\n(1) The Tribunal erred in law when it found that the manner by which the applicant exercises its statutory mandate could render section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act unconstitutional; and\n(2) The Tribunal's findings of unconstitutionality also resulted from the adoption of subsections 54 (1) (c) and (1.1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, subsequent to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 892. The Tribunal erred in law when it refused to apply section 13 of the Act because a refusal to apply subsections 54 (1) (c) and (1.1) would have provided a sufficient remedy in respect of this ground.\n[7] The parties filed with the Tribunal submissions with respect to the Respondent's motion for an adjournment. It is to be noted that the motion was filed prior to the Commission's application for Judicial Review in the Warman v. Lemire case.\n[8] I have reviewed the submissions of the parties and have concluded that it would be appropriate and would properly serve the interests of justice if this matter was adjourned. While the Supreme Court of Canada has ruled in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, 1990 3 S.C.R. 892 that s. 13 (1) of the CHRA is constitutional, the application now before the Federal Court seeks to bring clarity to this issue in view of the distinct factual and legal context giving rise to this Tribunal's decision in Warman v. Lemire. Clearly Member Hadjis' decision goes beyond the consideration alone of the penalty provisions in s. 54 of the CHRA, as he chose not to read out the penalty provisions and preserve s. 13 of the CHRA. It is now up to the Federal Court to determine the operability of s. 13 of the CHRA. This will achieve the clarity that the Commission has indicated and that I agree is desirable in order to allow the Tribunal to be able to determine this and other cases brought under s. 13 of the CHRA.\n[9] For these reasons I hereby adjourn these proceedings sine die pending the final outcome in the Warman v.

INTRODUCTION [1] Mr. Levan Turner is the complainant in this matter. He describes himself as a black male, who was 37 years at the time of his complaint. He is currently employed by the federal government as a PM-2 with Service Canada. He has been in that position since June 2008.\n[2] In 2005, Mr. Turner filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission. His complaint, dated February 8, 2005 is against the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). CBSA came into existence on December 12, 2003. It is the successor agency to the Canada Customs Revenue Agency (CCRA). CBSA is responsible for the enforcement of customs and immigration laws at Canada's borders. Following the creation of the CBSA, the position of Customs Inspector (CI) became Border Services Officer.\n[3] Mr. Turner's complaint arises out of two competitions for the position of Customs Inspector with CCRA. He applied in both competitions. At the time he applied, he was working as a seasonal CI for the summer season in the port of Victoria. He had worked as a seasonal CI in Victoria from 1998 to 2003.\n[4] The first competition he applied for was posted by CCRA on June 9, 2003 for a CI position in Vancouver, B.C. (Vancouver 1002). The second competition was posted by CCRA on October 11, 2003 for a CI in Victoria, B.C. (`Victoria 7003). Mr. Turner did not obtain either position. In both cases, the Selection Boards for these two competitions did not consider him qualified to be a CI.\n[5] Mr. Turner claims that the decisions of the Selection Boards were tainted by discriminatory considerations, namely considerations of his race, national or ethnic origin and age, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nA. Mr. Turner's Pre-Customs Inspector Experience [6] Mr. Turner's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 indicates that he worked in various jobs in Toronto between 1985 and 1995. He was also enrolled in a four year geography program at the University of Toronto, but did not complete it.\n[7] His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 also indicates that, between 1991 and 1995, he was a member of the Metropolitan Toronto Police Auxiliary. This is a voluntary activity which involved community policing, traffic control for special events and community public relations.\n[8] As a volunteer, he would do ride-alongs with a regular police officer and assist in policing duties. He was trained in defensive tactics, tactical takedowns and handcuffing. Mr. Turner estimated that, as an auxiliary, he gained more than 2,000 hours of policing and enforcement experience.\nB. Mr. Turner's Custom Inspector Experience (i) May 1998 to October 1998 [9] In 1995, Mr. Turner moved to Victoria. He first worked as a seasonal CI with the Marine Team, Revenue Canada, Customs & Excise, (the predecessor to CCRA) in Victoria, from May 1998 to October 1998. Marine is responsible for the outside processing of cruise ships, ferries, aircraft, pleasure craft and float planes. As to the ferries arriving in the Port of Victoria, marine dealt mainly with the Coho and the Clipper. The Coho is a car ferry that runs between Victoria and Port Angeles, and the Clipper is a passenger ferry that runs between Seattle and Victoria.\n[10] The duties of a CI include control of goods and people coming across the international border, interviewing and assessing their admissibility to Canada.\n[11] Marine involves primary inspection and secondary inspection. Primary inspection would be the first contact with a CI that persons would have coming off a ferry or cruise ship. That is when they would present their customs declaration and would be questioned by a CI.\n[12] At that point, the CI would determine whether they would be admitted to Canada or be sent to secondary for further examination. To make that determination, a CI is trained to ask standard questions and look for indicators, for e.g., whether they believe the traveler, how they answer questions, whether they are evasive, and then decide whether to send them to a secondary examination or admit them to Canada.\n[13] If they are referred to secondary, the primary CI would complete a referral sheet to be given to secondary. The secondary CI, who works in another area, would review the referral sheet, verify what was said at the primary inspection and take whatever action is required. This could be collecting custom duties and taxes, referring them to immigration if necessary or admitting them to Canada. Secondary inspection also has an important enforcement aspect. This involves searching, apprehending or arresting individuals seeking admission to Canada, who are uncooperative, belligerent or who become unmanageable when being questioned by a CI.\n(ii) December 1998 to October 1999 [14] Mr. Turner returned to work as a seasonal CI in Victoria from December 1998 until October 1999. He said that he took this position because he wanted to become a full time CI. This is because he loves the interaction with the public and because of his auxiliary policing background he had become very interested in law enforcement. CI work gave him the best of both worlds.\n[15] When he came back in December 1998, he was assigned to the Telephone Reporting Centre (TRC) and worked there from December 1998 to October 1999. The TRC is a static location. A CI assigned to the TRC works for the whole shift, and would not as a general rule, do any outside processing.\n[16] The function of the TRC is to clear private vessels and aircraft coming into Victoria from outside Canada. The masters of the vessels or the pilots of the aircraft would phone the TRC to obtain telephone clearance into Canada.\n[17] The CI would conduct the same interview, would ask the same questions that would be asked of a person coming across the border on land or by ferry. If they were admitted to Canada, they would receive a clearance number, which is proof that they had called in and were cleared by a CI.\n[18] If the CI determined that further information or examination was required, they would be referred for a secondary examination to another CI outside the TRC.\nC. Mr. Turner's December, 1998 to October, 1999 Performance Review [19] At the end of the season, Mr. Turner received a written performance review for December 1998 to October 1999 from Supt. Perry, his supervisor at the TRC.\n[20] In the review, Supt. Perry wrote that Mr. Turner had become knowledgeable with the legislation and regulations related to the duties performed by a customs inspector and TRC operations. His appearance was always professional and in accordance with Department guidelines. He said that Mr. Turner worked well with the rest of the team members and assisted with the training and guidance to new staff that came into the TRC. Supt. Perry did note in the review that TRC staff only make referrals and rarely help with primary or secondary referrals. He recommended Mr. Turner for re-employment as a CI for the next season.\n[21] Mr. Turner said that the TRC was the part of the CI job where he felt most at home and it was in the TRC where he spent most of his time. But he said that during that season, from time to time, he would help with outside processing doing secondary examinations. He did agree, however, that there was no mention in his review of doing any secondary enforcement duties.\n(i) May 2000 to October 2000 [22] Mr. Turner returned as a CI in the TRC and worked there from May, 2000 to October 2000. His performance review again was done by Supt. Perry. He noted that Mr. Turner demonstrated the ability to make decisions with limited information and exercised good common sense and sound judgment. Team work was a very strong point of his and he was of great assistance in training new staff. He was always looking for ways to improve the operation and share this with the rest of the staff. He demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the different systems used in the TRC. Again there is no mention of Mr. Turner helping out with the marine team. Supt. Perry recommended Mr. Turner for recall the next season.\n(ii) May 2001 to September 2001 [23] Mr. Turner worked as a CI in Victoria with the marine section from May 2001 to September 2001. His performance review was prepared by Supt. Kathryn Pringle. She commented that Mr. Turner conducted himself in a polite and professional manner. He communicated effectively both orally and in writing. He worked well with his co-workers and was always willing to assist with extra tasks without complaint. She noted that he had become the resident computer expert in the TRC and was able to resolve problems when there was no IT support, especially on the weekends.\n(iii) October 2001 to October 2002 [24] In October 2001, operating under a state of alert because of 9\/11, CCRA decided to hire seasonal CIs beyond the summer season. Mr. Turner was extended from October 2001 to December 2001 and then to October 2002 when he worked outside in marine.\n[25] For this period, he received two performance reviews, a mid-summer review and an end of season review. In his August 2002 mid-summer review of Mr. Turner, his supervisor, Supt. Baird, reported that Mr. Turner had a very good understanding of the primary process and was able to make quality referrals while facilitating low-risk travelers. He was able to make appropriate decisions when doing secondary exams and was professional, even in difficult circumstances.\n[26] Mr. Turner was a team player, communicated well with both the public and his co-workers and had the potential to be a very effective communicator. Supt. Baird lauded him for the effort he had made to bring forward issues in a constructive manner after pointing out that this was something Mr. Turner had failed to do in the past. He concluded by encouraging Mr. Turner to gain more experience in enforcement through secondary examinations.\n[27] In his October 14, 2002 end of season performance assessment, Supt. Baird wrote that Mr. Turner had an excellent understanding of primary and secondary procedures. He demonstrated an effective ability to deal with difficult or hostile situations and good judgment when dealing with secondary examination and enforcement activity.\n[28] He noted that Mr. Turner had successfully completed the Officers Powers and Use of Force training at the beginning of the summer and that he had been involved in secondary examinations during the summer and had worked on gaining enforcement experience. As with his other performance reviews, Mr. Turner was praised for interacting well with the public and his co-workers and for his willingness to take on extra work when asked.\n[29] In his evidence, Supt. Baird commented on the two reviews that he prepared for Mr. Turner in 2002. There are things that he liked about Mr. Turner as an employee and work that he did well. But he would not characterize Mr. Turner as fully developing into all of the roles expected of a CI. Mr. Turner was very comfortable doing that part of the job that was more service-oriented, like working in the TRC.\n[30] As to those of the job that required being more proactive in terms of enforcement and identifying non- compliance amongst travelers or doing secondary examinations and seeing them through to enforcement, such as seizures, that was not Mr. Turner's strong suit.\n[31] As to Mr. Turner's 2002 mid-summer review, Supt. Baird explained that employees were given their goals and objectives at the beginning of the season, what was expected of them and how they would be assessed in terms of performance. The mid-season assessment was to let them know if they're on track, or if there were performance issues.\n[32] Supt. Baird said that his consistent view of Mr. Turner was that he was always polite and courteous when dealing with the public and fellow officers and always presented himself in a professional manner even in difficult circumstances.\n[33] As to his comment about bringing work-related concerns forward in a constructive manner, he said this was added specifically to address a performance issue that Mr. Turner was having in the workplace. His observation was that at times, that he had a tendency to bring issues forward in a manner that Supt. Baird characterized as complaining. He identified this as an issue for Mr. Turner and acknowledged that Mr. Turner had positively responded and had made efforts to be more constructive.\n[34] Supt. Baird said that when he wrote in the review that Mr. Turner had the potential to be a very effective interviewer, he was underscoring that Mr. Turner had the fundamentals to develop good interviewing skills. But he was not saying that Mr. Turner was then a good interviewer. He had to work at it.\n[35] Good interviewing techniques are developed through practice. The more secondary examinations and focusing attention to that skill set, the better opportunity there is to develop and become more skilled. He observed that this was an area where Mr. Turner was weak and did not put enough effort into developing these skills.\n[36] Supt. Baird, said with respect to enforcement experience, that TRC offers very limited enforcement experience because the job involves answering telephones and making referrals to the field. Only rarely would TRC staff help with the secondary examination.\n(iv) May 2003 to September 2003 [37] Mr. Turner was last employed as a seasonal CI from May 2003 to September 2003 and worked outside in marine. His performance review was prepared by his manager, Supt. Terry Klassen. In his performance review, Supt. Klassen indicated that Mr. Turner provided quality service to the public and to his peers. At times, he had taken on a leadership role when the Supt. was not on site.\n[38] He noted that Mr. Turner had a good understanding of customs enforcement and provided fair, responsible and effective enforcement of the programs. He said that the seizure documents for that summer showed that Mr. Turner was involved in six different enforcement actions. In three of them, he was the lead officer, one for seizure and two for officer powers incidents, all dealing with narcotics.\n[39] But Supt. Klassen said this was average enforcement experience for that summer and would not necessarily provide a CI with a broad understanding or a good foundation for customs enforcement. Customs enforcement just doesn't deal with narcotic offences. It also involves seizures of other prohibited material such as pornography, alcohol, tobacco, clothing, souvenirs or jewellery that travelers do not report. There are a lot of areas of customs enforcement that were not covered under these six enforcement events.\n[40] He concluded that Mr. Turner had met the majority of the performance expectations and recommended him for re-hire.\n[41] After they met on September 26, 2003 to discuss and sign off on the review, they had an informal discussion in which Supt. Klassen brought up some concerns that he had not mentioned in the performance review.\n[42] Mr. Klassen told Mr. Turner there was a perception among some Supts. that he tended to avoid the harder tasks and sloughed off work. Mr. Turner said this was very surprising to him considering his performance review. He was shocked that Supt. Klassen didn't bring this to his attention sooner so he could respond.\n[43] Supt. Klassen also told Mr. Turner that there were also complaints from other custom inspectors that he did not do the cash-out at the end of his shift. A cash-out involves taking the monies collected from duties and taxes at the end of the shift, leaving enough for a cash float for the next shift, and taking the balance to the main office. At the main office, it is put in the safe for the day clerk to take to the bank the next morning. Again Mr. Turner said he was very surprised to hear this because nobody had ever raised this with him before.\n[44] David Cormie, who was a CI for 32 years, worked with Mr. Turner in marine. Mr. Cormie, would rate Mr. Turner at the top of the CIs he worked with. He would never describe Mr. Turner as lazy or that he ever was shirking his duties.\n[45] Mr. Cormie said that he worked shifts following Mr. Turner but did not recall any complaints about Mr. Turner not doing the cash-out. Mr. Cormie said it was always a judgment call whether to cash out a small amount such as $50 or leave it for the next shift.\n[46] After his informal discussion with Mr. Turner, Mr. Klassen sent an email dated October 4, 2003 to other Supts., Rick Peninger, Mara Gibbons, Kathryn Pringle, Trevor Baird and Diane Kavelaars. In his email, Mr. Klassen wrote: I then went to the point and started talking about how he is perceived, i.e., how he sometimes shies away from the harder tasks, or knows the right procedure, but asks to Superintendent for advice, hoping the Superintendent will use their discretion and go the easier way. It was also pointed out how other inspectors had complained that he had left cash outs for others to do instead of doing them on his shift.\n[47] The last three sentences in this email read: I asked him to take a close look at himself next year to ensure he is not dodging harder tasks of seeking the easy path. In turn he asked that we give him ongoing feedback on how he is doing in our eyes. The conversation went very well and without conflict.\n[48] On October 12, 2003, he sent another email to the Supts. entitled Talk with Levan, part two. He wrote that he had forgotten an important part of the conversation. It was regarding his attendance.\n[49] Mr. Turner recalled talking about attendance in this session. Mr. Klassen was concerned that either Mr. Turner's health was an issue or he was abusing his sick leave. He said that Mr. Turner's Leave Summary reports showed a steady increased use of sick leave and family related leave over his years of employment. Mr. Turner said this issue had never been raised with him before.\n[50] As to the family leave, Mr. Turner explained that Mr. Turner's girlfriend was on disability and had some medical issues. But she would be back at work and the family related leave would be lower.\n[51] Supt. Klassen's email concluded with the comment: We closed up the one and a half hour discussion with me emphasizing that he needs to be cognizant of the image he is presenting as one of jumping in with both feet and not looking for an easy solution. He also asked that I impart to the other Superintendents that they should feel free and easy to come and discuss with him when something is not sitting right as he does not see this sloughing off as part of his work ethic or nature.\n[52] Supt. Klassen did not record these concerns in Mr. Turner's performance review because he had not been given an opportunity to respond.\n[53] He also indicated that he had this discussion so that when Mr. Turner came back for the 2004 summer season, which Mr. Klassen recommended, his next supervisor would see these comments and work with Mr. Turner so that these concerns were addressed the next year.\n[54] Mr. Klassen agreed that he did not send similar emails concerning his end-of-season meetings with other seasonal employees to the other Supts.\n[55] Mr. Turner was not hired for the 2004 summer season. He was told this because CBSA had changed its hiring practices.\nD. Previous Competitions [56] Although Mr. Turner received very favorable job performance reviews as a five year seasonal term employee, he did not do well in prior competitions for an indeterminate CI position.\n[57] Mr. Turner applied for a CI position in competition Victoria 2009. He was interviewed on April 2, 2002 but failed to pass the interview, having scored a failing grade of 60 on the enforcement orientation. In their interview notes, the Board comprised of Supts. Kathryn Pringle and Dave Denis, indicated that Mr. Turner did not demonstrate the capacity to exercise balanced judgment. The reason was that, in answer to a question, he said that he would only collect duties and taxes if the traveler wanted to pay.\n[58] The Board also noted that one of his examples on which he was interviewed related to an incident from four years earlier. This indicated to the Board that he lacked current enforcement experience although he had worked several years experience as a CI.\n[59] In May 2002, shortly after his interview, Supt. Pringle called Mr. Turner and explained to him that his lack of enforcement experience had adversely affected his performance in the interview. She encouraged him to work outside in marine during the coming summer rather than in the TRC so he would gain more enforcement experience. She also encouraged him to apply in upcoming competitions if he wanted an indeterminate position once he had acquired that experience.\n[60] Initially he resisted this advice, telling Supt. Pringle that because he had not qualified in this competition, he would prefer to work in the TRC where he believed his talents could be better used. He did however work in marine the next season.\n[61] In 2002, Mr. Turner again competed for a CI position in Victoria 7012. He was interviewed on February 13, 2003 and again failed to qualify.\n[62] In his interview, Mr. Turner received a failing grade on both enforcement orientation and service orientation. A differently constituted Board, Supts. Tarnawski, Northcote and Pringle had similar concerns about his enforcement approach. The Board noted that Mr. Turner did not get all the information before making decisions. He made numerous assumptions regarding who he was dealing with and how he should deal with them. This was after his 2002 mid-season and end of summer performance reviews where Supt. Baird emphasized that Mr. Turner needed to get more enforcement experience.\nE. Vancouver Competition 1002 [63] The Vancouver competition, 2003-1727-PAC-3391-1002 was dated June 9, 2003. It was for a CI position for Vancouver International Airport District, Metro Vancouver District and Pacific Highway District. The competition was open to persons residing or working west of the Canadian Rocky Mountains.\n[64] In addition to the criteria to be satisfied to be screened into this competition, there was also an eligibility restriction, which provided, Applicants who have been interviewed for this position since January 1, 2002 will not be eligible for this position.\n[65] This competition was open both to those working in the public service and to external applicants. Applications were submitted online to the human resources section, who would compile a master list of the names and addresses of those who had applied and the date of their application. The applications were then given to the Selection Board appointed for the particular competition, who would decide who would be screened in.\n[66] Once a candidate was screened in, they would be invited to take the Customs Inspector Test (CIT). Those who had written and passed this test did not have to do so again. The pass mark was 585\/900.\n[67] Those candidates who passed the CIT were sent a Portfolio of Competencies package (POC) to be completed and returned. For Vancouver 1002, there were eight competencies listed: adaptability, initiative, client service orientation, dealing with difficult situations, decisiveness, self-confidence, teamwork and cooperation, and effective interactive communication.\n[68] Applicants were asked to describe a particular event, ideally two-three years old, and focus on what they did, felt and thought, using a different event for each competency.\n[69] The Selection Board would initially do a paper review of the POC package submitted by each candidate and determine whether there was sufficient information to demonstrate they had an understanding of the competencies. If so, they would be invited to an interview.\n[70] At the interview, the Board would question the candidate on some of the competencies. This was a much more intensive exercise by the Board and would also give the candidate the opportunity to expand on their written answers.\n[71] Mr. Turner read the Vancouver 1002 poster as being for a position in the Vancouver International Airport, Metro Vancouver District and Pacific Highway District. Because he had not interviewed for a CI position in Vancouver since January 1, 2002, he considered that he was eligible for this process.\n[72] The Vancouver 1002 competition involved two interviews. Mr. Turner satisfied the preliminary stages and was invited to the first interview on April 26, 2004. The members of the Selection Board were Supts. Ron Tarnawski, Mark Northcott and Karen Morin.\n[73] In the informal discussion prior to the formal interview, Mr. Turner mentioned to Mr. Tarnawski that he had met him before. He said Mr. Tarnawski's response was yes, he remembered Mr. Turner's voice and his presence. As noted earlier, Mr. Tarnawski was a member of the Selection Board who had interviewed him in February, 2003 for Victoria 7012.\n[74] Early in the interview, the Board asked him if he had applied for this position within the eligibility period set out in the job posting. Mr. Turner said no, his understanding and interpretation being that the position was for Vancouver.\n[75] The Board indicated to him that, in the event that CBSA's records indicate that he did in fact apply for the position since January 1, 2002, he would no longer be eligible for the process.\n[76] After the interview, the Board researched its files and found that Mr. Turner had in fact interviewed for two CI competitions since January 1, 2002, namely, Victoria 7009 on April 2, 2002 and Victoria 7012 on February 13, 2003.\n[77] Although Mr. Turner was successful at that interview, he was disqualified from proceeding to the second interview because he came within the eligibility restriction.\n[78] The interview notes from Mr. Turner's Vancouver interview, April 26, 2004 at shows a passing score of 70 and then the notation, not qualified to interview. NQ'd inside of restriction on poster.\n[79] Mr. Turner challenged this, saying that there were other people that had interviewed previously in Victoria. He believed them to be Trent Van Helvoirt, Heath Lariviere, Mike Curtis and Chris Hughes. It appears, however, from the evidence that these four persons had interviewed previously for Victoria and were successful.\n[80] Shortly after his interview, Mr. Tarnawski called him and explained that because Mr. Turner was unsuccessful in a prior Victoria competition within the time restriction, he was screened out of the Vancouver process. He also told Mr. Turner that the restriction did not apply to candidates who had been interviewed and were successful in prior Victoria competitions.\n[81] Mr. Tarnawski followed with a letter dated June 1, 2004, which Mr. Turner received on June 7, 2004. The letter referenced Vancouver 1002 and stated that due to a restriction on the Customs Inspector Job Poster, applicants who have been interviewed for the above-mentioned position since January 1, 2002, will not be eligible for this process. As it has been determined, you were interviewed after that date you are not eligible for this process. If you require any further information you are to submit a request in writing by June 9, 2004.\n[82] Mr. Turner sent a reply letter dated June 7, 2004. The CBSA date stamp indicated that it was received on June 11, 2004). In his letter, Mr. Turner requested further information. He noted that in their earlier conversation, Mr. Tarnawski told him that he was disqualified because he was not successful in the earlier Victoria competitions. But according to Mr. Tarnawski's June 1, 2004 letter, any candidate who was interviewed, successful or not, would be disqualified.\n[83] Mr. Turner did not receive any reply to his letter from CBSA. According to Mr.Tarnawski, this was because Mr. Turner's request letter was received after the date specified for requests for information. He said that CBSA was trying to make sure that people who asked for feedback were actually serious about getting feedback.\n[84] He conceded that Mr. Turner had raised serious concerns, but said if it's late it's late. However, his June 1, 2004 letter did not state that the request for information had to be received by June 9, 2004, only that it had to be submitted by that date.\nF. Shalivi Sharma [85] Shalivi Sharma gave evidence on behalf of CBSA. At the time, Vancouver 1002 was advertised, she was a CBSA Resourcing Advisor whose clients included mainland customs hiring managers for the Pacific Highway District, Vancouver International Airport, and Metro Marine District. She assisted them with the Selection Boards as well as with any training that Selection Board members needed and provided them with general staffing advice.\n[86] Ms. Sharma was involved in the drafting of the Vancouver 1002 competition poster. When she first met with the recruitment unit, which at that time consisted of Ron Tarnawski and Mark Northcott, they indicated that they were interviewing the same candidates over and over again who were not being qualified for the position.\n[87] At that time they were running multiple processes in order to deal with the shortage of customs inspectors and the high turnover rate. So they decided that anybody who was found not qualified, since January 1, 2002, not just for Vancouver, but also for Victoria, would not be considered for this process as not enough time would have lapsed for them to upgrade their skills.\n[88] Ms. Sharma agreed that the poster should have read candidates who had interviewed since January 1, 2002 and who were unsuccessful were not eligible for this competition. The failure to make this intent clear was an error on her part.\n[89] Ms. Sharma was asked whether a Selection Board should consider the past experience and performance reviews of an employee who has already been in the position, she said that it is not something she would advise the Board to do. Because this was also an external process, it would not be appropriate to consider the performance of an internal candidate. An external candidate would not have this advantage. All candidates should be assessed according to the same criteria.\nG. The Student Bridging Program [90] Ms. Sharma testified about the Student Bridging Program. It is for students who have worked with CBSA while they completed their studies and have graduated. They are then eligible to be bridged without competition into an indeterminate BSO position.\n[91] The process involves an assessment against a statement of merit criteria. The hiring manager determines whether they meet each of the qualifications that have been outlined. The program is administered by the Public Service Commission.\n[92] There's no minimum in the bridging program in terms of how many years they have worked. In the Student Bridging Program, the students would be hired seasonally, but some students do stay on during the fall and winter semesters but only work part time.\n[93] Between 2000 and 2005, there were less than 10 students who were bridged. Since 2005, the total has increased to about 20 or 30 a year in the Pacific Region.\n[94] Ms. Sharma did not consider the Bridging Program to be preferential treatment for persons under the age of 35, but agreed that the majority of students in that program would be under the age of 35.\n[95] Ross Fairweather also gave evidence for CBSA on the issue of age discrimination. He is the Acting Senior Policy Advisor for the Arming Division of CBSA and has been employed by that Agency and its predecessor organizations for approximately 30 years.\n[96] In 2004, he was an acting chief at the Vancouver International Airport, the traffic side of the International Airport. In that year he was invited to Victoria to speak to some of the CIs and it is alleged that at that time he said if you are under 35 and wanted to pursue a career in Customs come to Vancouver. He said that is not something he would have said. Nor is he aware of any under 35 hiring policy within CBSA or its predecessor organizations.\n[97] In fact, Mr. Fairweather said it is the opposite. It's always been his belief and several of his colleagues that some world experience is good for people in this job. They need to have maturity and ability to bring the real world to bear on the decisions they are making about people who travel from other places in the world.\n[98] Mr. Fairweather said he thinks it takes a blend. He said CBSA has officers who come in under the bridging program and he has also hired officers who were mature persons who have spent years in other professions. To his knowledge, bridging was not a great source for recruiting officers.\nH. Supt. Ron Tarnawski [99] Mr. Tarnawski is a Supt. at the Pacific Highway Truck Crossing located in the Pacific District. He has worked with CCRA\/CBSA for about 19 years.\n[100] Mr. Tarnawski said that, in the past, each district within the Pacific Region was responsible for its own recruitment and running its own selection and assessment process. There were inconsistencies in the way the processes were being run and there was no experience being transferred from one process to another.\n[101] Also they were highly competitive and it was not uncommon for districts to offer positions to employees that the other district had run a selection process for and qualified. They would wait for a pool to be created and then raid the pool.\n[102] So it was decided to establish one recruiting unit that would do all the selection processes for the entire Pacific Region. This has evolved into a National Recruiting Centre and a national recruiting process with regional offices throughout the country. As part of this process, recruiting units were set up and a standardized interview process was designed where a candidate would apply online, the application would be screened by people that had experience in screening.\n[103] Mr. Tarnawski spoke to the eligibility restriction for Vancouver 1002. He said it was put in because they were seeing the same candidates in selection process after selection process. An overwhelming majority would be found not qualified, only to be back for another interview a short time later in the next selection process. Candidates were not taking the opportunity nor did they have the time to develop the required skills. It was becoming a very difficult issue to manage.\n[104] Mr.Tarnawski agreed that the wording of the eligibility restriction was lacking. It should have said candidates who interviewed for the position and were unsuccessful were not eligible for this competition.\n[105] Mr. Tarnawski first met Mr. Turner when he was one of four candidates he interviewed for Victoria 7012 on February 13, 2003. The reason for his involvement in the interviews was that Victoria was running this competition and needed guidance from the recruiting unit on how to implement the new national process.\n[106] As to applying the eligibility restriction and making sure that candidates were not slipping through the net, Mr. Tarnawski said that it was necessary to physically go through the databases from previous selection processes and compare them against the Vancouver 1002 database. Ms. Sharma and her staff did this and highlighted those persons who had applied to previous competitions within the eligibility period.\n[107] Mr. Tarnawski said that as the database was being developed, those comparisons were taking place. Sometimes the comparison may not have been done until sometime into the selection process, depending on when the information was available. Unless a candidate was screened out prior to the interview, eligibility was determined at the interview stage.\n[108] Mr. Tarnawski said that this wasn't perfect. The lists of candidates were in the hundreds and the Unit had limited resources to deal with the large volume of candidates.\n[109] Mr. Tarnawski said that he did recognize Mr. Turner at the Vancouver 1002 interview as having participated in an earlier competition, but did not specifically recall which one. But he strongly denied the suggestion that he recognized Mr. Turner because he is a black man and because of his size.\n[110] Rather, he recalled him as a person with a very outgoing, positive personality and for that reason it was easy to remember him as one of the four persons that he interviewed on February 13, 2003. That is why after his interview, the Board decided to follow up on Mr. Turner's eligibility. Mr. Tarnawski did not recall whether the Board followed up on any other candidate to determine whether they fell within the restriction.\nI. How was the Eligibility Restriction Applied? [111] To determine if the eligibility restriction was applied to all candidates for Vancouver 1002, Ms. Sharma was asked to provide a master list of all candidates who had applied for Vancouver 1002 and who had previously been interviewed in other competitions since January 1, 2002. She produced four lists, Vancouver 1002; Victoria 7003; Victoria 7012; and Victoria 1020.\n[112] The master lists purported to list all of the applications received for each of these competitions that were prepared at the closing date of the poster when all the applications were received and reflected all of the candidates who applied for the competition. The master list was updated as the recruitment unit went through the process of screening people in, inviting them for testing, interviews, and so on.\n[113] The evidence does not disclose the posting and closing dates for Victoria 1020 and whether it was within the restriction. In any case, it does not matter as the data indicates that all of the candidates who applied for Victoria 1020 and Vancouver 1002 failed the CIT and thus would not have been interviewed.\n[114] For the other competitions, the master lists indicated as follows. There were 21 candidates who applied for Vancouver 1002. Of these, some also applied for Victoria 7012 or Victoria 7003 or both. Mr. Turner applied in all three.\n[115] Of these 21, only two, Laura Keble and Blaine Wiggins initially raised questions about the equal application of the restriction. On review, however, the evidence shows that Ms. Keble applied for Victoria 7012 but was found not qualified on her POC. This did not disqualify her for Vancouver 1002 because she did not proceed to interview. She did qualify for Vancouver 1002.\n[116] Blaine Wiggins' status is more problematic. He did not qualify at the interview for Victoria 7012, yet he did proceed to the second interview for Vancouver 1002 but did not qualify at that stage.\n[117] There are two possibilities here. Either Mr. Wiggins fell within the restriction and should not have proceeded to interview in Vancouver 1002. The other possibility is that the master list for Mr. Wiggins shows him listed at two different addresses for the two competitions.\n[118] The conclusion from this data is that no candidate who was unsuccessful after interview in Victoria 1020, 7012 or 7003 competitions succeeded in Vancouver 1002, except perhaps Mr. Wiggins and the evidence is inconclusive that he was the same candidate in both competitions.\nJ. Victoria 7003 [119] This was a competition for a CI position in Victoria. It was posted on October 11, 2003 and was open to those persons resident or employed in the Greater Victoria area.\n[120] Mr. Turner said that he applied for this position because it was the end of his seasonal term and he was trying to get into a pre-qualified pool to ensure he could come back for the following summer. Or if they were going to offer any permanent positions, he wanted to make sure he was ready to go.\n[121] The process was the same as for Vancouver 1002. Mr. Turner was invited to interview for Victoria 7003, which took place on December 13, 2003. He was found not qualified at the interview.\n[122] The Selection Board consisted of Supts. Baird and Supt. Kathryn Pringle. At the interview, the Board addressed Mr. Turner's submissions on two competencies, Effective Interactive Communication and Teamwork and Cooperation. He scored 60 for Effective Interactive Communication and 40 for Teamwork and Cooperation. A pass mark of 70 was required for each competency.\n[123] Supt. Baird testified at the hearing with respect to Mr. Turner's interview and the Board's interview notes.\n[124] Under Effective Interactive Communication, the Board's notes record embellished facts, was a police officer when actually an auxiliary volunteer. Written material paints other negatively. In his evidence, Supt. Baird explained that at his interview, Mr. Turner seemed at first to indicate that he was a police officer with the Metropolitan Toronto Police. Later in the interview, he clarified that he was an auxiliary volunteer.\n[125] The Board considered this to be an example where he was not clear in his communication, whereas the Board was looking for a very clear, concise, and accurate communication.\n[126] The Board also referred in its notes to a few examples that Mr. Turner provided under Teamwork and Cooperation. One example involved an IT problem that came up during his shift in TRC. Apparently none of the IT experts in Victoria or Ottawa were able to solve the problem. Nor was an experienced TRC officer who, according to Mr. Turner's example, became frustrated and gave up.\n[127] Then Mr. Turner wrote that he got involved when it became obvious that the problem needed to be fixed. So he phoned Ottawa, spoke to an IT person who became frustrated. Mr. Turner told him that he would deal with the problem and ultimately it was resolved.\n[128] Another example that Mr. Turner offered for Teamwork and Cooperation (Dealing with Difficult Situations) involved a black male entering Canada in the afternoon on the Coho ferry. He became agitated at some of the CI's questions and as Mr. Turner described it in his example: I noticed Nina [Patel] trying to talk to him and calm him down but he did not like her at all....I came in and took over, and she stood back and kept others away while I dealt with it...\n[129] Mr. Turner went on to say that Inspector Ken Moore had the dog Lego go over the car, and the traveler took issue with that. At this point he started putting back all his items that were on the ground being inspected, back into the vehicle. Ken got really upset and grabbed a corner of the tool bag he was trying to put back into the vehicle. Ken looked him straight in the eye and said in an aggressive tone. I'm finished when I say I'm finished.\n[130] Mr. Turner described how he jumped in between the two of them and separated them and took the traveler to the front of the vehicle. It was his observation that it looked like it was going to escalate into a fistfight.\n[131] Mr. Turner went on to note that he went to Immigration and found out exactly what papers were needed. They weren't too helpful but he was able to get the necessary papers.\n[132] The Board's comments were that Mr. Turner came across as being very negative towards his co-workers and supervisors in this example. He tended to embellish the facts and overstate his role at the expense of others involved. He diminished their involvement in that it appeared that only Mr. Turner was able to resolve the situation.\n[133] There is also a reference in the Board's notes that Mr. Turner did not agree with a Chief Supt's decision on charging Coho for overtime. Mr. Turner said that the Chief was going to charge the Coho as a cost recovery for coming in late. The officers were scheduled to be there at a certain time but because it was late, they had to work overtime.\n[134] Mr. Turner said that he did not agree with the decision and told them at the interview the reason why. His answer led to the Board recording: Did not agree with Chief's decision on change, on charging Coho for overtime. Made a conclusion without all the facts, quick to blame, and jumps to conclusions.\n[135] In his POC, Mr. Turner had referenced Nina Patel and Ken Moore as validators for his T&C example. Ms. Patel was the Acting Supt. when this situation occurred. He said that he was fully aware that following an interview these references may be called to substantiate the accurateness of the circumstances described.\n[136] Supt. Baird testified that his knowledge of Ms. Patel was that she is an officer with a lot of experience dealing with hostile and aggressive travelers in highly charged situations. It would be out of character for her to stand back and let Mr. Turner deal with the problem. As for Ken Moore, Supt. Baird said that he is an experienced dog handler who has dealt with many hostile travelers. Mr. Turner's description of Mr. Moore's actions was not consistent with his observations of Ken Moore in the workplace.\n[137] Supt. Baird did indeed contact Ms. Patel about a month later in January 2004 to validate the example which Mr. Turner had provided. He felt compelled to do so because it was so out of character from what he had observed in the workplace.\n[138] His recollection is that he phoned Ms. Patel who was in Quebec at the CBSA training facility. He did not provide her with a copy of the POC. He read the example to her over the phone and she provided her comments.\n[139] Supt. Baird took notes of this conversation and Ms. Patel's comments. His notes indicate that Mr. Turner did talk to this traveler and was good with him but his involvement was not instrumental. She said that he made others look worse to make himself look better. She considered that she maintained control of the situation and the traveler.\n[140] When asked why he chose to validate this information a month after Mr. Turner had been disqualified, Supt. Baird agreed that there was no need to do so. But Mr. Turner did offer Ms. Patel and Mr. Moore as validators.\n[141] Supt. Baird did agree that, in his mid-summer 2002 assessment of Mr. Turner, he was quite satisfied with Mr. Turner's effective interactive communication skills. And at no time as Mr. Turner's supervisor did he have any concerns with his truthfulness.\n[142] He also agreed that Mr. Turner does have those skills in terms of effectively communicating with the public, asking questions, listening to responses, and with the proper application and effort in secondary, the potential to develop those added skill sets to make him an effective interviewer. But he was not yet there.\nII. Decision [143] To succeed in his complaint, Mr. Turner must first show a prima facie case of discrimination based on the prohibited grounds of age and national or ethnic origin as he has alleged in his complaint.\n[144] On the question of age discrimination, the evidence does not support a prima facie case. There was some statistical evidence comparing the age demographics in CCRA\/CBSA to the Public Service as a whole and the labor force in general. These statistics were inconclusive. More to the point, neither counsel referred to them in their final argument.\n[145] The other evidence offered by Mr. Turner was a comment supposedly made by Mr. Fairweather that if you are under 35 and want a career in customs come to Vancouver. He denied making this comment and said that he was not aware of any policy that preferred candidates under age 35. In fact, his view was that CIs should be a mix of all ages and experience.\n[146] Nor does the Student Bridging Program support an allegation of age discrimination. Though it results in younger candidates being hired as CIs, the evidence is that it has not been a major source for recruiting CIs. Between 2000 and 2005, less than 10 CIs were hired through this program and post 2005, 20-30 CIs were hired in the Pacific region.\n[147] As to race and national and ethnic origin, apart from of a raft of scattered, confusing and inconclusive statistical evidence (which was entered into evidence by Mr. Turner, but which neither party argued) there was no evidence of direct discrimination.\n[148] In order to make a prima facie case, Mr. Turner has to rely on circumstantial evidence and inferences as to discrimination. CBSA agrees that in cases like this, which involve circumstantial evidence, the appropriate test to apply is as follows: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses.\n[149] Mr. Turner identified these aspects of the evidence that he says support an inference of discrimination:\nA. Qualifications and experience as Customs Inspector. [150] Mr. Turner worked as a seasonal CI from 1998 to 2003, a total of six seasons. His performance reviews were always positive especially for effective interactive communication and teamwork and cooperation. Every review recommended that he be rehired for the next season.\n[151] He was extended from October 2001 to October 2002 having satisfied the criteria of TRC experience, reliability and teamwork and cooperation. Yet, he never qualified for a permanent CI position, with all of his experience and his consistently positive performance reviews.\nB. The Klassen emails [152] This refers to the post performance review discussion that he had with Supt. Klassen when he told Mr. Turner of some Supts' perception that he was lazy and sloughed off work and was dishonest. Mr. Turner asserts that this is the stereotypical, negative perception of black men.\n[153] Following this discussion, Mr. Klassen sent an email to the Supts. setting out in detail the subject matter of their conversation. He followed with a second email detailing other subjects that were not covered in his first email.\n[154] Mr. Klassen's explanation for sending these emails was to provide information to be used by Mr. Turner's next season's manager to develop his priorities and objectives. Mr. Klassen had never spoken to Mr. Tuner about these concerns previously. Nor did he send similar emails for any other seasonal employee.\nC. Victoria 7003 [155] Mr. Turner did not qualify because he did not get the required score of 70 on the effective interactive communication and teamwork and cooperation competencies. This was so although two of the Board members, Supts. Baird and Pringle, had given him very good performance reviews on these two areas.\n[156] Further, the Board believed that he had embellished or was untruthful about his previous policing experience when it was clear from his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that he had worked only as an auxiliary.\n[157] Supts. Pringle and Baird also felt that Mr. Turner lacked sufficient enforcement experience. Mr. Turner responded by making specific efforts to work outside of the TRC in marine to compensate for this deficit. He was commended by Supt. Baird in his performance review for pursuing this.\n[158] In January 2004, Mr. Baird contacted Ms. Patel as Mr. Turner's POC validator. This was about a month after he was disqualified and as Supt. Baird agreed there was no purpose in doing this. He did not follow up with any other candidate's validator.\nD. Vancouver 1002 [159] At the interview, when Mr. Turner mentioned that he had met Mr. Tarnawski before, his reply was yes, he remembered Mr. Turner's voice and presence.\n[160] Both Mr. Tarnawski and Ms. Sharma conceded that they applied the restriction according to their intent and not according to its wording.\n[161] Although there were many hundreds of applicants for Vancouver 1002, Mr. Tarnawski conceded that it was quite likely that only Mr. Turner was the only applicant screened out by the restriction. He was also the only one for whom the Board followed up on to see if he met the restriction.\n[162] Finally, there was Mr. Tarnawski's insistence on maintaining the date fixed to reply and refusing to answer Mr. Turner's June 7, 2004 letter request for further information. Especially when Mr. Turner had raised the inconsistencies in Mr. Tarnawski's explanation regrading the restriction and which Mr. Tarnawski agreed was a serious and legitimate request.\n[163] For the purposes of this decision, I will assume that Mr. Turner has shown a prima facie case of discrimination. I will now consider whether CBSA has provided an explanation for not offering Mr. Turner an indeterminate CI position and whether this explanation is reasonable and not pretextual.\n[164] CBSA argues that Mr. Turner's position amounts to the assertion that his seasonal employment together with his positive performance reviews is evidence that he was qualified for the CI position. The only possible inference from the fact that he was unsuccessful in competition for this position is because of his race, national or ethnic origin.\n[165] CBSA agrees that Mr. Turner's job performance reviews were positive. But these related to his performance as a seasonal term employee. The evidence is however, that indeterminate CI positions are staffed through a competitive selection process (except for student bridging). For Mr. Turner to attain his goal, he must demonstrate in a competitive selection process that he was qualified for this position.\n[166] This explains why Mr. Turner did not obtain a CI position solely on the basis of his previous experience and commendations. It is not enough that he started as a seasonal term CI in 1998 and was hired back for a total of six seasons and received, for the most part, favorable job performance reviews.\n[167] In Vancouver 1002, Mr. Turner failed to proceed to the second interview for Vancouver 1002 because CBSA considered that he was within the eligibility restriction. There is no question that this restriction was poorly drafted and did not on its face exclude only unsuccessful candidates who had interviewed in earlier competitions. Mr. Tarnawski and Ms. Sharma, both of whom were involved in originating this restriction, conceded this.\n[168] Mr. Tarnawski explained that the reason for excluding unsuccessful candidates was that selection boards were interviewing the same candidates in successive competitions and an overwhelming majority was found to be unqualified. The purpose of the two year waiting period was to avoid interviewing the same candidates and to give them more time to develop the necessary skills for a CI.\n[169] It may well be that Mr. Turner was the only candidate that the Board followed up on after his interview. And he may well have been the only candidate who was caught by the eligibility restriction.\n[170] But, according to the master lists prepared by Ms. Sharma for the earlier competitions (apart from the questionable status of Mr. Wiggins), Mr. Turner was the only candidate who should have been ineligible.\n[171] Further, it is not logical that the eligibility restriction was meant to apply only to Vancouver positions as Mr. Turner believed, but was expanded to cover all previous competitions only to screen out Mr. Turner. If CBSA did not want to hire Mr. Turner for discriminatory reasons, it would have been much easier to do so by assigning him a failing mark for his first interview.\n[172] Nor in my opinion does the fact that Mr. Tarnawski recognized Mr. Turner from an earlier competition interview support a conclusion of discrimination. I accept his evidence that he had only interviewed four persons on that day, February 13, 2003 and remembered Mr. Turner about a year later as a very positive person with a very outgoing personality.\n[173] Finally, in my view, the fact that Mr. Tarnawski did not respond to Mr. Turner's June 7, 2004 letter request for more information on the application of the eligibility restriction represents an excessive bureaucratic attempt to control his workload. It should not be construed as a discriminatory act.\n[174] Dealing now with Victoria 7003, Supt. Pringle was a member of this Board. She also was a member of the Victoria 7009 Board who interviewed him. After that interview, she made a point of calling Mr. Turner to explain the reason he had not performed well in his interview. She told him that he lacked enforcement experience and she encouraged him to gain that experience before he applied to another competition.\n[175] Supt. Baird, a member of this Board, also had identified concerns about Mr. Turner's lack of enforcement experience. Like Supt. Pringle, he encouraged Mr. Turner to work outside to become a better interviewer and better his enforcement skills\n[176] These are hardly the actions of an employer who was discriminating against Mr. Turner. On the contrary, they show that both Supt. Pringle and Supt. Baird were supportive, encouraging and seeking to help him to advance his career with CBSA.\n[177] As Supt. Klassen noted in his 2003 review, Mr. Turner was involved in six enforcement actions. But as he pointed out, this was average experience for the summer and would not provide a broad understanding or a good foundation for customs enforcement.\n[178] This lack of enforcement experience was certainly a negative factor in Mr. Turner's inability to qualify for a CI position in previous competitions. He did not perform well in interviews.\n[179] The Board's notes for his Victoria interview record that in his examples of events relating to Teamwork & Cooperation, Mr. Turner came across as being negative towards his co-workers. He overstated his role at the expense of others involved. He diminished their involvement in that it appeared that only he could was able to resolve a difficult situation.\n[180] As to Effective Interactive Communication, the Board felt at first that he had embellished his experience with the Metropolitan Toronto Police, which he later clarified. This led the Board to mark him down because his communication was not clear or accurate.\n[181] I have reviewed these examples that Mr. Turner offered in the context of the competition and the required competencies. In my opinion, the Board's assessment and interview marks were reasonable.\n[182] I can see nothing in the Board's notes that could lead to the inference that Mr. Turner failed to qualify for the CI position because of discriminatory considerations. Nor is there anything see nothing ominous in Supt. Baird calling Ms. Patel after the fact. Her name was supplied by Mr. Turner as one of his validators. For Supt. Baird, Mr. Turner's description of her actions in the example he provided seemed so inconsistent. His attempt to obtain her version of the events does not to have any taint of discrimination.\n[183] I have concluded that CBSA has provided a reasonable explanation as to why Mr. Turner did not qualify for a CI position in either the Vancouver 1002 competition or the Victoria 7003 competition. I have also concluded that there is nothing in the evidence or in CBSA's explanation that can be considered pretextual.\n[184] For these reasons, I have concluded that Mr. Turner has not substantiated his complaint. Accordingly, it is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJ. Grant Sinclair\nOTTAWA, Ontario June 10, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE: Levan Turner v.

CONCLUSION: THE DISCRETION OF THE ADJUDICATOR\nI. APPLICATION [1] The Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) makes an application (heard by way of motion) to record the hearing by sound and video before this Tribunal and to broadcast clips from the same for its evening dinner news the same day. It also seeks to retain the tapes for archival purposes. The Complainants and Interested Parties (First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada (Caring Society), Assembly of First Nations, Chiefs of Ontario and Amnesty International) support the application. The Commission does not object to the application as long as any order provides that there be a one hour delay between transmission and broadcast. The Respondent, Attorney General of Canada (representing the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development) (INAC) opposes the application. APTN, the Caring Society and the Respondent filed full submissions in respect of this application. APTN states that it will abide by the Commission request of a minimal one hour delay. APTN presents a protocol by which it states that it will abide, and APTN further states that this protocol will ensure that its broadcast will be appropriate and respectful of the hearing process. It submits that it will provide a fair and accurate account of the proceedings without disturbing them.\n[2] APTN is the only network in Canada that focuses specifically on Aboriginal issues. Its audience is targeted to the Aboriginal community and those following issues surrounding the community.\nII. CURRENT HEARING PROCESS [3] The hearing in this matter will follow the current procedure of this tribunal. The hearing will be an open hearing wherein the public may attend and view all proceedings. Subject to an application further to s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), no matters will be heard in secret. The media is welcome to attend the entire hearing and to take notes and report on the hearing. Attendees are not allowed to bring tape recorders to the hearing. The entire hearing is recorded for adjudicative purposes and the digital voice recording (DVR) is provided to the Chair and to the parties, and may be used by the parties for examination, cross-examination and final argument. The parties may obtain a transcript of the hearings from the DVR at their cost and use the transcript for the same purposes.\n[4] The positions of certain parties to this motion require more detailed discussion.\nIII. APTN'S POSITION [5] APTN's position includes the following assertions:\nThe importance of these proceedings cannot be overstated. INAC is allegedly discriminating against children who live in First Nations communities by not funding child welfare services to the same degree as is provided to other children. The outcome of these proceedings will have an overwhelming effect on the lives of families living on reserve in Canada. The alleged rate of children that live on reserve who are in the custody of child and family services is eight times greater than for those children that do not live on reserve. Further, both the Auditor General in her report of 2008 and the Standing Committee on Public Accounts in its report of 2009 have specifically pointed to issues with the federal government's funding of child and family services for First Nations people living on reserve. The federal government is enhancing its funding of child and family services to five provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Prince Edward Island. At the Tribunal, details will be provided outlining how the funding will help children and families who live on reserve. APTN's viewers have an interest in those details as well as any further information regarding how INAC will provide or enhance funding to other jurisdictions. Television broadcasting depends on audio and visual recordings. APTN's news reporters use television cameras to gather news and to report the news to the public. Preventing the filming of the proceedings would constitute an unjustifiable section 2 (b) infringement of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter). APTN's presence will not be disruptive and will afford every Canadian with an opportunity to have some access to the hearing which he\/she cannot attend, thus fulfilling one of the Canadian Human Rights Act's objectives, which is education.\nIV. CARING SOCIETY'S POSITION [6] The Caring Society's position includes the following assertions:\nThe public has a right to meaningful access to public proceedings. Moreover, First Nations people from remote communities across Canada have a direct interest in the outcome of this case, and many of them will only have meaningful access to this hearing if it can be viewed on APTN. The determination of the motion for televised access must be informed by Canada's constitutional values, including the freedom to communicate and receive information about court proceedings, equality for historically disadvantaged groups, and the importance of respecting First Nations traditions. Television access to the proceedings is consistent with the open court principle and the right to meaningful access to the proceedings. Television access to the proceedings will provide all First Nations peoples with an equal opportunity to access them, and the denial of such access would adversely impact a disproportionate number of First Nations people who cannot attend in person due to geographic and socio-economic barriers. Television access to the proceedings will advance the purpose of the CHRA to educate the public about discrimination and human rights. Public education about human rights and discrimination has been held to be one of the central goals of human rights legislation and helps to advance the main purpose of the CHRA: the eradication of discrimination. Television access to the proceedings will allow them to be reported in a manner that is consistent with First Nations traditions and culture. Canadian courts have recognized the sharing of oral knowledge as an integral part of the distinctive culture of many First Nations communities. Audio and visual recordings of the hearing will make it more culturally relevant and accessible; the decision as to whether to allow television access should reflect and honour the ancestral rights of First Nations, and their traditional practices, including the oral sharing of knowledge.\nV. RESPONDENT'S POSITION [7] The Respondent's position includes the following assertions:\nThe Respondent opposes the motion for television access to the present CHRA proceedings. The public interest in open court proceedings is served by allowing the dissemination by the media of the details of the proceedings; it does not include a right-constitutional or otherwise-to film and broadcast the proceedings themselves. The presence of television cameras at the hearing risks affecting the testimony of witnesses, the behaviour of participants and the overall serenity of the atmosphere. This in turn could potentially affect the outcome of the hearing and compromise the fairness of the proceedings and the legislative objectives of the adjudicative process. The Courts have repeatedly disallowed filming of trial proceedings. Important distinctions exist between the filming of administrative, quasi-judicial and judicial proceedings on the one hand, and the filming of hearings held by commissions of inquiry on the other.\nVI. THE LAW GOVERNING THIS MATTER [8] Extensive arguments were made by APTN and the Caring Society to the effect that denying camera access to the proceedings would be inconsistent with the open court principle, now enshrined in s. 2 of the Charter. The Respondent made extensive arguments in support of the premise that camera access was not mandated by s. 2 of the Charter. I have not been convinced by the authorities cited to me that denying camera access would constitute an unjustifiable breach of that aspect of the freedom of expression which guarantees the public's right to receive information, through the media, about court proceedings. I come to this conclusion principally for the following reasons:\ndenying camera access does not prevent APTN from reporting on the proceedings, but merely limits the form or method of reporting in which it can engage; in any event, as will become clear from the analysis below, I believe that limiting camera access to the proceedings-even if it constituted a prima facie s. 2 Charter breach-would be justifiable under the test established in Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 (S.C.C.), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, and R. v. Mentuck, 2001 SCC 76 (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442, 2001 SCC 76. I make this finding on a general basis, as I note that requiring the Tribunal to perform a Dagenais\/Mentuck analysis on a witness-by-witness basis unacceptably hampers the efficient conduct of the proceedings.\n[9] In addition to the open court principle and s. 2 of the Charter, the Caring Society is also invoking the aboriginal rights and traditions affirmed by s. 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, as well as the equality rights guaranteed in s. 15 of the Charter. The argument made is that the camera access motion involves an interpretation of the CHRA, and that the aforementioned constitutional rights should inform this interpretation exercise.\n[10] However, I do not accept that, in determining this motion, I am applying or interpreting a provision of the CHRA. The CHRA does not prohibit, nor require, camera access. Section 52 assumes that the inquiry will be conducted in public, but even if the camera access motion is denied, the inquiry does not cease to be conducted in this way. It remains a public inquiry.\n[11] Ultimately, given the silence of the enabling legislation on the point in issue, I feel that the determination of this motion requires an exercise of the Tribunal's common law discretion as master of its own house or master of its own procedure. (See Therrien (Re), 2001 SCC 35; Prassad v. Canada (M.E.I), [1989] 1 S.C.R. 560).\n[12] This is not to say that the discretion may be exercised in an unconstitutional manner, or in a manner that thwarts the objectives of the CHRA. Rather, it is merely a reflection of the fact that consideration of this motion needs to be grounded in the realities of what this Tribunal requires in order to properly adjudicate the complaint, and what would detract from the integrity of such adjudication.\nVII. ANALYSIS Factors militating in favour of granting the Motion for Camera Access and Broadcasting\n[13] In exercising my discretion whether or not to grant this motion, I note that there are a number of factors raised by APTN and the Caring Society that would support an order for camera access.\nCommunity Interest\n[14] First of all, it is undeniable that justice is enhanced when those who have a direct interest in legal proceedings are better able to follow and observe them. In the current matter, the underlying human rights complaint is of great and direct interest to large numbers of First Nations people, in particular those individuals who have received child and family services, or have relatives or close friends who have received such services. To the extent that camera access makes the proceedings easier to follow for the people directly affected, and facilitates the sharing of information about the proceedings, such access would be beneficial to the community interest in the administration of justice.\nChallenges unique to this constituency\n[15] Secondly, the above factor has even more weight when one considers the unique features of the concerned communities in this particular case. The constituency served by the Complainants is widely dispersed geographically, and to a significant extent, lives in regions of the country where the cost of physically traveling to Ottawa for the hearing is economically prohibitive. In this regard, I accept the submission made by the Caring Society regarding the significant economic barriers faced by many First Nations people, and children in particular. Moreover, the distribution of the constituency across the country makes it impossible for the Tribunal to find any single venue that would adequately facilitate physical access for all concerned.\n[16] Finally, the major policy dimensions of these proceedings inform the degree and extent of interest shared by those members of the public, including First Nations persons (but not limited thereto) who feel that the case will have a large impact on their lives, or the lives of those who are close to them.\n[17] However, these factors need to be balanced against others, in particular, those raised by the Respondent.\nFactors militating against granting the Motion for Camera Access and Broadcasting\nThe CHRT Proceedings: An Adjudicative Process\n[18] From a reading of the materials filed by the parties, the Caring Society appears to view the present proceedings as something akin to a truth and reconciliation commission. For its part, APTN attempts to draw an analogy from the media practices of commissions of inquiry. However, in neither case does the characterization of the present proceedings accurately reflect the statutory regime under which it operates.\n[19] Under the CHRA, the primary objective of the Tribunal is to adjudicate complaints, and decide whether statutory liability should be imposed. As was stated by the Supreme Court in Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association, 2003 SCC 36, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 884:\n23 The main function of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal is adjudicative. It conducts formal hearings into complaints that have been referred to it by the Commission. It has many of the powers of a court. It is empowered to find facts, to interpret and apply the law to the facts before it, and to award appropriate remedies. Moreover, its hearings have much the same structure as a formal trial before a court. The parties before the Tribunal lead evidence, call and cross-examine witnesses, and make submissions on how the law should be applied to the facts. The Tribunal is not involved in crafting policy, nor does it undertake its own independent investigations of complaints: the investigative and policy-making functions have deliberately been assigned by the legislature to a different body, the Commission.\n[20] I will not discuss in detail the mandate of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, other than to say it will be evident from a reading of that body's enabling instrument that its mandate is significantly different from that of the tribunal described by the Supreme Court in Bell Canada, supra.\n[21] In regard to matters before commissions of inquiry, as the Respondent has stated in its submissions, the public plays a crucial role in these types of proceedings. Inquiries seek to educate the public, to assist in community healing, and to restore public confidence in institutions. These are laudable objectives, and unquestionably of invaluable importance to any democratic society ruled by law.\n[22] However, in establishing the CHRT, Parliament gave effect to a different order of priorities. The Tribunal has its own distinct function to perform in the legal system, namely, presiding over adversarial proceedings, determining liability, and-in the case of a substantiated complaint-issuing orders. In this context, while the public is not generally excluded, the public's role in the CHRT process is simply not as pivotal as it is in those commission of inquiry proceedings where television camera access is routinely granted.\n[23] APTN placed much reliance on the Saskatchewan Board of Inquiry decision in Andreen v. Dairy Producer Co-operative Ltd. (No. 2) (1994), 22 C.H.R.R. D\/80. Even allowing for the different enabling legislation, which I feel played a large role in the Andreen decision, I respectfully disagree with the members' approach in that case, which in my view (at least in the context of the CHRA) overly conflates the objects of the legislation with the purpose of the adjudicative body created thereunder. I also note that the camera access granted in the Andreen case was more restricted than the relief sought by APTN in this motion.\n[24] While not applicable to this dispute, s. 52 of the CHRA is nonetheless illustrative of the Tribunal's nature and function: Tribunal proceedings are to be conducted in public. However, the right of the public to observe them is subordinate to several overriding considerations, in particular, the fairness of the inquiry. It is to the question of fairness which I now turn.\nFairness to all Parties\n[25] As has been alluded to above, the primary goal of any adjudicative process is, after hearing evidence and argument, to determine whether the evidence led can support findings of fact that give rise to legal liability. All of this must take place in conditions that respect the rules of natural justice.\n[26] Television broadcasting poses unique challenges to the adjudicative process. On one hand, it offers the potential of enhanced accuracy of reporting, since raw images and dialogue can be directly transmitted to the public with minimal interpretive filtering by journalists. On the other hand, one would be na\u00efve to believe that no journalistic license is ever exercised in regard to the format in which television footage is broadcast, especially in the context of news programs. In this last respect, the mere ability to edit footage of the proceedings and broadcast extremely short excerpts thereof grants immense discretion to the broadcaster, and raises the potential for selective depiction of evidence, incomplete portrayals of a witness' testimony going to credibility, and significant manipulation of the sequence, duration and context of the filmed events. Yet despite all this, the depictions and portrayals retain a very convincing semblance of accuracy, because they feature realistic sound and images of the source event.\n[27] Due to these unique features and attributes of video broadcasting, I believe that allowing camera access to the proceedings risks undermining the integrity of the Tribunal process, and just as importantly, public confidence in the integrity of this process.\n[28] I add that while it is not clear whether an order will be sought for the exclusion of witnesses in these proceedings, such orders are commonly sought and granted in CHRT proceedings. It is not difficult to imagine the mischief posed to the efficacy of such an order in a hearing where witness testimony is being broadcast to the public on a regular basis, while other witnesses have yet to testify on the same issues.\n[29] In view of the above, I conclude that granting camera access is likely to significantly and irreparably impair the fairness of the hearing for all parties. Compromising the fairness of the proceedings could render it a nullity in law.\nPrivacy of the Participants\n[30] Even assuming that many of the participants in the process (e.g. Complainant witnesses, counsel for the Complainants, CHRC counsel) are willing to waive any privacy right to have their images broadcast across the country while participating in legal proceedings, I do not think it fair to extrapolate from this that all participants in the hearing are prepared to freely grant such a waiver.\n[31] In addition to any legal rights hearing participants might possess entitling them to control the use of their image and likeness by others, as a federal institution, the CHRT is bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act. Some of the fundamental tenets of this legislation are that federal institutions: (i) shall not collect personal information unless it relates directly to an operating program or activity of the institution, and; (ii) shall only use personal information under their control for the purpose for which the information was obtained (Privacy Act, R.S., 1985, c. P-21, as amended, ss. 4, 7(a)). Again, while the consent of the individuals concerned may mitigate the effect of these principles, it is to be noted that the Privacy Act is a quasi-constitutional statute and must be interpreted purposively. Moreover, in the context of an adversarial litigation process, the possibility of obtaining or ascertaining the existence of freely-given and informed consent may be quite limited.\n[32] Ultimately, the hearing participants will be attending at the hearing room for the purpose of participating in quasi-judicial proceedings; they make themselves available for this purpose. In this context, allowing them to be filmed and have their statements and likeness broadcast to innumerable spectators across the country in a sense renders them captive actors in a media drama. This is not compatible with what should be the only motivation for their presence in the hearing room, and the only activity on which they should be focused : namely, participating in legal proceedings, and fulfilling legally-defined roles and functions connected thereto.\n[33] In short, I find that camera access will inevitably compromise the privacy of hearing participants to an intolerable degree, and introduce an element of distraction which is significantly detrimental to the hearing process.\n[34] Before leaving this section of the analysis, I wish to make one additional observation. While I do not in any way base my decision on this incident, I note that earlier this month an issue arose regarding the Complainant Caring Society's publication, via the Internet, of evidence obtained during a pre-hearing affiant cross-examination from which the public had been excluded. Such an incident serves as a reminder that the Tribunal must be vigilant in articulating the adjudicative needs of its quasi-judicial process vis-\u00e0-vis the technological realities prevalent in the field of communications media. I repeat, however, that I have not relied on this incident in deciding the current application for television camera access.\nVIII. Conclusion: The Discretion of the Adjudicator [35] Earlier in these reasons I observed that this motion calls upon the Tribunal to exercise its discretion as master of its own procedure, or master of its own house. But there are at least two important limits on this discretion: the existence of any rules laid down by statute, and the principles of natural justice.\n[36] While reasonable people may disagree about the application of some of the legal principles described in this decision, it is important to state that I alone, as the member assigned to inquire into this complaint, am responsible and accountable for the integrity of this adjudicative process. It is my legal duty to ensure that this hearing takes place in conditions which comply with the CHRA, which respect the principles of natural justice, and which-more broadly-help maintain the reputation of the administration of justice, on which the entire legal system depends.\n[37] It is my firm opinion, after due consideration of the submissions of the parties, that nothing less than the exclusion of cameras from the hearing room will suffice to ensure that the publicity generated by these proceedings does not undermine its integrity.\n[38] On a final note, I should add that nothing in this ruling is meant to minimize the importance of the considerations raised by APTN and the Caring Society. The disposition of this case is the result of a balancing of closely competing interests and principles. In deference to the considerations raised by APTN, the Caring Society, and those parties who support their position, pursuant to the unanimous request of all parties, in the event that the jurisdictional motion is dismissed, an opening ceremony will take place at the outset of the hearing on the merits, and I grant television camera access to the Applicant to film and broadcast this ceremony.\n[39] Thus the motion is granted in part only as per paragraph 38.\nSigned by\nShirish P.

THE COMPLAINT\nII. FINDINGS OF FACT\nIII. LAW\nA. Establishing a Prima Facie case of discrimination\nB. Reversal of burden of proof and justification\nIV. ANALYSIS\nA. Has the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant contrary to S. 7 (a) of the Act by denying the Complainant equal access to employment on the basis of his physical disability?\nB. Has the Respondent provided a reasonable (non-pretextual) explanation in answer to the prima facie case of discrimination?\nV. DECISION\nI. THE COMPLAINT [1] The Complainant Mr. William Shmuir filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) on March 21st , 2007 alleging that the Respondent Carnival Cruise Lines (Carnival) discriminated against him contrary to s. 7 (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act ( the Act) by refusing to employ him on the basis of a physical disability.\n[2] Mr. Shmuir's complaint alleges that on October 11th, 2006 he attended a job presentation and interview session (the job fair) in Toronto, ON that he had been invited to by Cast-a-Way, the recruiting employment agency for Carnival, for a position of Corporate Trainer with Carnival. He alleges that he advised Carnival through Cast-a-Way that he was visually impaired prior to receiving the invitation and attending the job fair. At the job fair, following a presentation by Carnival, a required multiple choice basic skills test was distributed to attendees with a scantronanswer sheet. A scantron answer sheet contains bubbles that must be shaded in to identify the correct multiple choice answer to allow for a computer to read answers. Mr. Shmuir indicated to Carnival that he could not fill out the scantron answer sheet because of his visual impairment and requested the opportunity to fill it out by writing answers on the sheet. He alleges that Carnival refused him the opportunity to take the required test in a manner that would accommodate his visual impairment as he had requested, by circling his chosen answers on the question sheet. He alleges that he was told by a representative of Carnival that because of his visual impairment and the requirements of the job, there was no point in him pursuing the job opportunity for the Corporate Trainer position. He further alleges that he was then asked to leave the job fair thereby effectively denying him the opportunity to obtain employment.\nII. FINDINGS OF FACT [3] Mr. Shmuir has High Myopia and Congenital Familial Nystagmus in both eyes, resulting in significantly subnormal vision. His best corrected visual acuities measure 20\/200 in both eyes. In essence, this means that with high myopic correction glasses he can see in each eye at 20 feet what a person with 20\/20 (normal vision) can see at 200 feet. His eyes are not able to stay in focus and move about involuntarily. He cannot hold a vehicle driver's licence as a consequence of his visual impairment. The Tribunal observed that he was able, however, to haltingly walk to the witness stand without assistance and to read slowly at close range documents presented to him.\n[4] Mr. Shmuir is 37 years of age. Despite his life long disability he has lived independently since he was a young man. He currently lives in Hamilton and works without pay for a not-for-profit corporation called Community Functionality Facilitation Inc. That organization, according to Mr. Shmuir, facilitates disabled individuals in obtaining services and accommodations within their community. His only source of income comes from an Ontario Disability Subsidy that pays him between $13,000.00 and $14,000.00 per year including a small meal subsidy of about $200.00 a month. He obtained a Child and Youth Worker Diploma from Mohawk College in 2003 after successfully completing a three year program. Other than his current unpaid work with Community Functionality Facilitation Inc., it does not appear that he has been employed except with a contractor doing small renovation jobs such as painting during the mid 1990's. He also claims to have had some experience working with children with developmental disabilities and with young offenders.\n[5] Cast-a-Way is the employment agency that Carnival and other Cruise Lines usually engage to assist with recruitment. Cast-a-Way is a separate company from Carnival. It was not a party in these proceedings. In or about 2006 Cast-a-Way advertised a number of positions for various Cruise Line companies. Additionally, as part of its recruitment efforts for Shipboard Corporate Trainers, in the Spring\/Summer of 2006 Carnival also placed advertisements in Toronto newspapers seeking applications for candidates for those positions. The position was described specifically as Shipboard Corporate Trainer, indicating that the duties of the position would be performed onboard one of its cruise ships while at sea. The advertisement stated that the position required previous group training experience, and excellent presentation, communication, and public speaking skills.\n[6] Mr. Shmuir submitted a general r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to Cast-a-Way in or about July of 2006. Receipt of Mr. Shmuir's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was confirmed by an e-mail by Mr. Eric Theriault on July 6, 2006. In Mr. Theriault's e-mail he stated that Cast-a-Way would be looking for qualified youth counsellors for Disney Cruise Lines in the Fall of 2006.\n[7] Mr. Shmuir's evidence was that with his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 there was also a cover letter submitted that, among other things, pointed out to Cast-a-Way that he was a disabled individual with low vision. Mr. Shmuir's evidence was that both he and his work colleague and friend Mr. Ben Bishop e-mailed this cover letter with the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on at least two occasions to Cast-a-Way. Mr. Bishop gave evidence that in addition to e-mailing the cover letter, he also faxed it to Cast-a-Way on or about July 4, 2006. The cover letter did not have a date, nor did it reference the inclusion of a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 with it. There was no documented evidence of the cover letter having been forwarded by e-mail or fax nor was there any evidence of it having been received by Carnival or Cast-a-Way. Cast-a-Way's correspondence referred only to receipt of the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The r\u00e9sum\u00e9 did not refer to any disability. Representatives of Carnival and Cast-a-Way who gave evidence at the Hearing denied that they had ever received the cover letter or that they had any indication of Mr. Shmuir's disability prior to October 11, 2006, when the job fair was held for a Corporate Trainer position with Carnival.\n[8] There was no follow up by Cast-a-Way for the Disney Cruise Lines youth counsellor job after Mr. Theriault's e-mail, but at some time before October 2, 2006, Ms. Nicola Barton of Cast-a-Way called Mr. Shmuir to discuss a Corporate Trainer position with Carnival.\n[9] Mr. Shmuir's evidence was that during the call from Ms. Barton he mentioned his visual impairment to her. Ms. Barton's evidence was that he did not mention his disability to her. Her evidence was that she reviewed Mr. Shmuir's experience to ensure that he could meet some of the basic job requirements, particularly in terms of work experience. She claimed that she explained to him what was required of a candidate before he or she could work on a ship to determine whether the candidate would be suited to living and working at sea. Her evidence was that she told Mr. Shmuir during the telephone conversation that one of the fundamental requirements for working on the ship was that he would have to have a thorough medical examination and that he must be physically fit and able in accordance with Carnival's medical policy and safety at sea policies.\n[10] Mr. Shmuir's evidence was that he followed up Ms. Barton's call to him a day or so later with a telephone call to her for the express purpose of confirming again his visual impairment, to make sure she was clearly aware of it. Mr. Shmuir contended that she told him that she was not concerned with his visual impairment and as long as he could get to the ship he would be fine. Ms. Barton gave evidence that she had no recollection of such a conversation.\n[11] Ms. Barton sent an e-mail dated October 2, 2006 to Mr. Shmuir in which she indicated that he had been selected to attend Carnival's Corporate Trainer presentation and interviews. The e-mail indicated that the presentation would be held on Wednesday, October 11, 2006 starting at 9:00 a.m. in the Mount Pleasant room of the Grand Hotel on Jarvis Street in Toronto. The e-mail also indicated that Mr. Shmuir should dress professionally in business attire, that the presentation would take one hour but that he should plan to spend the day, given that interviews would be conducted after the presentation. The letter also requested that Mr. Shmuir bring a copy of his passport, an updated r\u00e9sum\u00e9, photograph, and a criminal background check.\n[12] On October 11, 2006 Mr. Shmuir got up early in the morning to go from his home to attend at the Grand Hotel for the Corporate Trainer job presentation and interviews. He was driven there by Mr. Bishop.\n[13] In attendance at the job fair on October 11, 2006 were Mr. Scott Nelson representing Carnival, and Ms. Nicola Barton of Cast-a-Way.\n[14] Mr. Shmuir's evidence was that upon entering the Mount Pleasant room before the session started, he registered by telling Ms. Barton that he was present and advising her of his visual impairment. He was followed by Mr. Bishop who he described as his ride to the session. He sat at the back of the room at a table, as the other tables closer to the front were occupied by other candidates who had already arrived. Mr. Bishop sat close by him on a couch to his right side near the entrance door to a hallway outside the room. Ms. Barton, in her evidence, denied that Mr. Shmuir had told her of his visual impairment before the session started.\n[15] I accept the evidence of Carnival that it did not have prior information concerning Mr. Shmuir's visual impairment before the start of the job fair on October 11, 2006. My finding on this point is based on both the curious absence of any documented proof concerning the sending of the cover letter or its receipt, as previously referred to, and my assessment that Mr. Nelson and Ms. Barton were more credible witnesses than Mr. Shmuir based upon their general demeanour at the hearing, their clarity in recalling facts, and my impression of the probability of their versions of the evidence.\n[16] The job fair started at about 9:00 a.m. on October 11, 2006. Mr. Scott Nelson, Carnival's Director of Shipboard Training conducted the job fair. Mr. Nelson has had almost 20 years experience in his field and has himself held the position of a Shipboard Corporate Trainer. There were approximately 21 candidates invited to the job fair. Mr. Nelson was hoping to hire a number of candidates for positions as corporate trainers on Carnival's fleet of 22 cruise ships. Carnival operates around the world with about 33,000 employees. Its home base is in Miami, Florida. Its ships vary in size, carrying approximately 3,000 to 4,000 passengers with crews of approximately 900 to over 1,000 members. All of its on-board employees are considered to be seafarers and have some responsibilities for safety and emergency response.\n[17] The schedule for the job fair included a group informational session for the first two hours in the morning including videos and question and answer sessions, followed by a 20 minute basic skills test. After a 1 hour lunch the afternoon was devoted to interviews of all invited candidates, including a 2 minute presentation by each candidate on topics selected by them.\n[18] The topics covered in the group informational session included: Firstly, information about Carnival Cruise Lines including its history, its fleet of ships, its personnel, its ports of call, its type of guests and style of cruising, and its corporate vision. Secondly, information about living and working on board a ship including cabins and having a cabin mate, food, cultural diversity, time off and approximate work hours, approximate contract length, leisure time and organized crew activities, benefits, how the role of corporate trainer was viewed on board and hospitality expectations. Thirdly, information about safety responsibilities on board the ship including how safety was the number one priority, how all team members were responsible for safety on board, how a corporate trainer was responsible for conducting various safety-related training activities including crowd management, crisis management, leadership, vessel familiarization, and how corporate trainers were expected to take an active role in shipboard safety committees and initiatives as well as safety drills and training. Fourthly, information about corporate training job functions.\n[19] In the information session Mr. Nelson highlighted the tasks, responsibilities and requirements that were expected of a corporate trainer hired by Carnival. Some of the tasks that were highlighted included the following: Delivering a wide range of training programs and educational resources; Representing the Corporate Training department in a professional and positive manner; Effectively communicating with peers, Training & Development Manager, Senior Training & Development Manager, Director Shipboard Training and all shipboard management; Facilitating all onboard training programs and maintaining accurate records thereof; Day-to-Day running and administration of the Crew Training Centre; Attending and actively participating in bi-monthly safety meetings; Maintaining the Crew Training Centre; Producing accurate and timely reports, and adhering to set standards for record keeping and other Corporate Training functions; Attending all seminars and training programs as directed by Corporate Training Management and participation in emergency response situations including fire suppression and ship evacuation.\n[20] The pay for a corporate trainer position is $1,800.00 per month U.S. The job is a contract position for 6 months to be undertaken within a 10 month time frame. Following the 6 month term crew members are required to be off without pay for 2 months before commencing another 6 month term if rehired to a subsequent 6 month contract. The extra 2 months in the 10 month time frame provides added flexibility to schedule the 6 month work term.\n[21] During the information session Mr. Nelson tried to point out to the attendees in a realistic way some of the challenges of being in a ship environment away from family and friends for long periods of time. Mr. Nelson gave evidence that most of the corporate trainers did not last with Carnival for more than two 6 month terms owing to the rigors and conditions of the job. He asked the attendees to make sure that they understood all of the challenges and told them that it was really their decision if they were selected as to whether or not they wanted to commit themselves to that kind of life. He stressed that safety and emergency response were the highest priority tasks for all crew members in order to protect the lives of the passengers, other crew members and themselves. If selected based on their relevant experience, qualifications and presentation skills at the session, they would have to undergo a medical examination to ensure that they met required standards for seafarers and for safety requirements set by the company and by international conventions for seafarers and by coast guard regulations.\n[22] It was pointed out in the information that Carnival provided that it would be advantageous that applicants for the Corporate Trainer position have relevant educational qualifications, previous group training experience, excellent presentation, communication and public speaking skills and an outgoing guest service oriented personality.\n[23] Following the presentation, the schedule for the job fair provided for a 20 minute general skills test. The evidence of what occurred during this phase of the job fair on October 11, 2006 diverges as between the testimony of Mr. Shmuir and Mr. Nelson.\n[24] Mr. Shmuir's evidence of what occurred was as follows. The general skills test discussion began after lunch on October 11, 2006. When Mr. Nelson began to describe the test and alluded to the scantron sheet for filling out answers, Mr. Shmuir raised his hand to advise Mr. Nelson that because of his visual impairment he would not be able to use the scantron test to answer the questions since the bubbles were too small for him to read. He asked Mr. Nelson for the opportunity to write the answers or circle the answers to the multiple choice questions on the question sheet. Mr. Nelson initially told him that he would get back to him on his request and continued to explain the test to the other attendees. Thereafter, Mr. Nelson began to distribute the test\/answer sheet. At this point Mr. Shmuir again raised his hand and reminded Mr. Nelson of his problem with the test. Mr. Nelson then came back to where he was sitting at the back of the room at a table and began to discuss the matter with him. Mr. Shmuir told Mr. Nelson that he needed to be accommodated in writing the test because of his visual impairment. Mr. Nelson then spoke to an unidentified Afro- American man who was in the room and said that Mr. Nelson would take care of it. Mr. Nelson then went to speak with Ms. Barton and the two of them returned to where Mr. Shmuir was sitting and asked him to follow them outside of the Mount Pleasant room to the adjacent hallway. Mr. Bishop was sitting on the couch at the back of the room to his right during this time. Mr. Shmuir followed Ms. Barton and Mr. Nelson out of the room to the hallway near to the entrance door which was left open. Mr. Bishop also moved to this area close to where Mr. Shmuir, Ms. Barton and Mr. Nelson were standing. Mr. Nelson told Mr. Shmuir that as a consequence of regulations related to cruise ships at sea, Coast Guard inspections and various problems that he would encounter on board including seeing the various signs, he would not be able to qualify for the job as a Corporate Trainer because of his visual impairment. Mr. Nelson asked Mr. Shmuir to leave. Mr. Shmuir told Mr. Nelson that in 90% of his job applications he was denied opportunities because of his sight impairment. After he was told to leave by Mr. Nelson, Mr. Shmuir and Mr. Bishop went into the room and got their coats and then left. They were followed by two men in dark suits who appeared to be escorting them out of the hotel to the street at very close quarters. He felt that the experience of being asked to leave and being followed out of the building was demeaning and made him feel like a second class citizen. He did not ask Mr. Nelson whether Mr. Bishop could join him on the cruise ship to attend and assist him with his job.\n[25] Mr. Nelson's account of what occurred on October 11, 2006 was as follows. The general skills test discussion took place before lunch. As Mr. Nelson was describing the test and the process for taking the test to the attendees, Mr. Shmuir raised his hand. Mr. Shmuir did not mention his disability or any difficulty in writing the test at that time and Mr. Nelson told him that he would attend to him after distributing the test. After he had distributed the test he went to the back of the room to where Mr. Shmuir was seated at a table and he spoke with him. Mr. Bishop was seated next to Mr. Shmuir at the table. He crouched down between Mr. Shmuir and Mr. Bishop to ask Mr. Shmuir what he wanted to talk about and it was at that time that Mr. Shmuir told him that he could not read the test because of his visual disability. Mr. Nelson then went to see Ms. Barton to ask her if she knew anything about Mr. Shmuir's situation. Ms. Barton told him that she knew nothing about Mr. Shmuir's disability. Mr. Nelson then went back to speak with Mr. Shmuir and asked him to follow him and Ms. Barton to the hallway to discuss the matter further. Mr. Nelson felt that it was appropriate to go to the hallway with Mr. Shmuir in order to avoid disturbing the other attendees who were now writing the test and to spare Mr. Shmuir any embarrassment. There were no men in dark suits for security or other purposes in the room nor was there any man present who could have been described as Afro-American. The only people present in the Mount Pleasant Room were the other candidates, Mr. Shmuir, Mr. Bishop, Ms. Barton and Mr. Nelson. Mr. Nelson, Ms. Barton, Mr. Shmuir and Mr. Bishop all went outside the room into the hallway and closed the door. Mr. Nelson spoke with Mr. Shmuir in the hallway and tried to explain to him some of the challenges he might face with his visual impairment in doing the job as a Corporate Trainer on board a cruise ship at sea. He mentioned the Coast Guard inspections, regulations and requirements and signage. He told Mr. Shmuir that it was his choice as to whether or not he wanted to pursue this job opportunity. He did not ask him to leave or discourage him from continuing to participate in the process in any way and, in fact, specifically asked him if he wanted to continue. Mr. Shmuir did not ask Mr. Nelson to accommodate him in the writing of the test. Mr. Shmuir asked Mr. Nelson whether Mr. Bishop would be allowed to join him on board the ship in order to assist him and Mr. Nelson told him that that would not be possible. Mr. Shmuir indicated to Mr. Nelson that he did not want to continue with the application process and that he wanted to leave. He thanked Mr. Nelson for the information. Mr. Shmuir and Mr. Bishop went into the room and got their coats and left without anyone following them.\n[26] I accept the evidence of Mr. Nelson that he did not discourage Mr. Shmuir from continuing his attendance at the job fair and that he did not ask him to leave. Mr. Nelson was an excellent witness who was very clear in his evidence. He is very experienced in his job. Mr. Shmuir seemed to have some difficulty in remembering events. For example, after mentioning that he had applied for a number of positions he could not actually specify any positions that he had applied for in particular other than one. His story about the two men in dark suits and the unidentified Afro-American man seemed improbable to me. None of these individuals were identified by Mr. Nelson or Ms. Barton as being present and one would hardly expect such people to be hired for security or similar purposes for a job fair for a corporate trainer position. In my view, Mr. Nelson tried to properly advise Mr. Shmuir about what he might face on board a cruise ship at sea as a Corporate Trainer who was visually impaired. I believe that had he been asked to accommodate Mr. Shmuir in the writing of the test he would have done so. If Mr. Nelson had truly been inclined to discriminate against Mr. Shmuir on the basis of his disability he could easily have had Mr. Shmuir continue to participate at the job fair and then allow the medical testing or the assessment of his qualifications and experience for the job to end his application. I believe that Mr. Shmuir's decision to leave the job fair was completely voluntary and at that point he himself ended his application for employment. Ms. Barton, who was also a credible witness, corroborated Mr. Nelson's account of the events at the job fair.\nIII. LAW A. Establishing a Prima Facie case of discrimination [27] Section 7 of the CHRA states:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\na) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\nb) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nDisability is a prohibited ground of discrimination under s. 3 of the CHRA.\nThe evidence in this case established that the Complainant has low visual acuity and is considered to be legally blind.\n[28] The initial onus is upon the Complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a decision in favour of the Complainant, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. The Respondent's answer should not be considered in the determination of whether the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission) and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204.)\nB. Reversal of burden of proof and justification [29] Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the burden of proof shifts to the Respondent to demonstrate by providing a reasonable (non-pretextual) explanation that the alleged discrimination either did not occur as alleged, or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory or justified. It is not necessary that the discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a Complainant to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer's actions or decisions. (Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48, paras. 4-5; CHRA, s. 15). See also Canada v. Lambie 1996 CanLII 3940 (F.C.).\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Has the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant contrary to S. 7 (a) of the Act by denying the Complainant equal access to employment on the basis of his physical disability? [30] On the evidence of the Complainant alone, without considering the answer by the Respondent, I find that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability, namely his visual impairment which constitutes a disability under the Act. Mr. Shmuir's evidence was that his application for employment was terminated by the Respondent effectively not allowing him to continue in the process because of his visual impairment.\nB. Has the Respondent provided a reasonable (non-pretextual) explanation in answer to the prima facie case of discrimination? [31] The Respondent's answer to the Complainant's allegation with respect to what actually happened in the Mount Pleasant Room following the distribution of the skills test and in the discussion in the hallway thereafter, satisfies me that the Respondent did not, in any way, terminate the application for employment by the Complainant. Rather, my finding is that the Complainant himself terminated the application voluntarily when he decided to leave. As such there was no refusal to employ that ever arose in this case since the application for employment if there ever was one, was terminated voluntarily by the Complainant before any decision could be made by the Respondent on whether or not to hire the Complainant.\nV.

Lustig\n[1] This Ruling is in response to a request by the Complainants dated December 10, 2009 for the Tribunal to finalize the List of Complainants and settle the quantum of the Complainants\u2019 costs in connection with this matter.\n[2] The Complainants are a group of predominately female nurses who work with medical advisors as medical adjudicators in the CPP Disability Benefits Program to determine eligibility for CPP disability benefits. The medical advisors are a group of predominately male doctors.\n[3] The Complainants allege that since they were first hired in 1972, they have been performing the same work as the medical advisors and yet have been treated very differently from the advisors in terms of professional recognition, remuneration, payment of licensing fees, and training and career advancement opportunities. .\n[4] The Complaint was initiated on the 8th day of December, 2004 and was referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) to this Tribunal on the 10th day of December, 2005 pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[5] In a Decision dated December 13, 2007, (the liability decision), 2007 CHRT 56, as amended on May 28, 2009 the Tribunal found that while there was a significant overlap in the functions that had been and were being performed by the advisors and the adjudicators, there were differences in the work that justified some, but not all of the differential treatment between the two groups of employees. In particular, the Tribunal found that the Respondent had not provided a reasonable, non-discriminatory response as to why the advisors are recognized as health professionals and compensated accordingly, when their primary function is to make eligibility determinations and yet, when the adjudicators perform the same function, they are designated as program administrators and are compensated as such.\n[6] Having found the complaints to be substantiated, the Tribunal granted the parties\u2019 request to order that the discriminatory practice cease, but refrained from specifying the measures that should be taken to redress the practice. As per their request, the parties were given an opportunity to negotiate the appropriate measures to be taken with all of the stakeholders, with the Tribunal retaining jurisdiction over the remedy issues in the event that the matters were not resolved. This was the only reservation by the Tribunal in its liability Decision.\n[7] The parties were given three months to negotiate a settlement of the outstanding remedy issues. However, an agreement was not reached.\n[8] Therefore, a hearing was convened to address the following issues:\nThe appropriate manner to redress the discriminatory practice; Compensation for lost wages if any; The compensation for pain and suffering experienced by the Complainants as a result of the discriminatory practice; and Any other outstanding issues with respect to remedy.\n[9] The majority of Complainants were represented by Mr. Laurence Armstrong as Counsel. Those Complainants who were not represented by Mr. Armstrong did not appear in person or through counsel at either the liability or the remedy stages of the hearings, although they had notice of both.\n[10] An Application for Judicial Review with respect to the Tribunal\u2019 s liability decision was filed on January 14, 2009 with the Federal Court (see Federal Court File T-55-08). The Federal Court dismissed the Application for Judicial Review on May 4, 2010. (See Canada (A.G.) V. Walden, 2010 FC 490, appeal pending, see Federal Court of Appeal File A-219-10)\n[11] In the Decision dated May 25, 2009 (the remedies Decision), 2009 CHRT 16, the Tribunal found:\nThe appropriate manner to redress the discriminatory practice was to create a new Nursing subgroup for the medical adjudication position (s) and that work on the creation of the new subgroup be commenced within 60 days of the date of the Decision; There would be no compensation for lost wages; The compensation payable by the Respondents for pain and suffering experienced by the Complainants as a result of the discriminatory practice would be $6,000.00 for each of two of the Complainants only, plus interest; and Reasonable Counsel costs plus interest should be paid by the Respondents to Mr. Armstrong for his services in representing most of the Complainants with the parties to agree on the quantum of the costs and the Tribunal to retain jurisdiction on this point should the parties fail to agree.\n[12] Applications for Judicial Review with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s remedies decision were filed on June 24, 2009 with the Federal Court (see Federal Court files T-106-09, T-1024-09 and T-1025-09). The Federal Court has not ruled on these applications and this matter is continuing as a specially managed proceeding before the Federal Court.\n[13] According to their submissions, the parties disagree on the number and identity of individuals on the List of Complainants.\n[14] The Respondents\u2019 position is that the 413 people listed as Nos. 1 to 413 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto, should be on the List. The Respondents\u2019 position is based on their view that these people were the only ones that the Tribunal was dealing with when it made its liability decision and that having done so it is functus officio with respect to the request of the originally identified Complainants to supplement the List of Complainants with more people.\n[15] The Commission\u2019s position is that the 416 people shown as Nos. 1 to 416 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto, should be on the List. The Commission\u2019s position is the same as the Respondents\u2019 position except that it submits that the people listed as Nos. 414 to 416 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto, should also be on the List since they had complaints that the Commission referred to the Tribunal but inadvertently were not added as parties and, therefore, fall within exceptions to the principle of functus officio.\n[16] The Complainants\u2019 position is that the 427 people shown as Nos. 1 to 427 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto, should be on the List. The complainants take the same position as the Commission regarding individuals numbered 414 to 416 inclusive. In addition, the Complainants\u2019 position is that the person listed as No. 417 in Schedule A attached hereto should be on the List since her complaint was also referred by the Commission to the Tribunal but was inadvertently not added as a party. Further, the Complainants\u2019 position is that the people listed as Nos. 418 to 427 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto, should be on the List since their names were submitted and they participated from the outset in these proceedings but somehow their names were removed or disappeared from the List notwithstanding that there is no evidence of any complaint being filed by them, or on their behalf, with the Commission and referred to the Tribunal and notwithstanding that their names were first presented during the remedies hearing after the liability decision was rendered, and that they were never accepted as being part of the List by the Respondents or the Tribunal.\n[17] Mr. Armstrong, on behalf of the Complainants, has essentially requested the Tribunal to reopen its liability decision to add new parties. Pursuant to the legal principle known by the term functus officio (having discharged one\u2019 s duty ), courts cannot, as a general rule, reopen their final decisions except where there has been a slip in drawing it up or where there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, 1989 CanLII 41 (S.C.C.), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848. The Supreme Court in Chandler found that the functus officio rule applies to administrative tribunals as well, though its application may be more flexible . Thus, a decision can be reopened if there are indications in the tribunal\u2019 s enabling statute that it may do so in order to discharge its functions. In addition, a tribunal may complete its statutory task and reopen its decision if it failed to dispose of an issue that was fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the tribunal is empowered by its enabling statute to dispose.\n[18] In Grover v. Canada (National Research Council), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1000 (Q.L.), the Federal Court held that although the Act does not contain an express provision that allows for the Tribunal to reopen an inquiry, the wide remedial powers set out therein, coupled with the principle that the Act should be interpreted liberally in a manner that accords full recognition and effect to the rights protected under the Act, enables the Tribunal to reserve jurisdiction on certain matters in order to ensure that the remedies ordered by the Tribunal are forthcoming to complainants. The Court found in that case that the Tribunal had specifically retained jurisdiction to deal with any issues relating to the implementation of one of the remedies that it had ordered in disposing of the complaint. It was within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, therefore, to reopen its hearing and hear new evidence.\n[19] Similarly, in Canada (Attorney General) v. Moore, 1998 CanLII 9085 (F.C.), [1948] 4 F.C. 585, the Federal Court noted that the Tribunal in that case had also explicitly stated, in issuing its remedial order, that it would retain jurisdiction in the event that the parties were unable to work out the details relating thereto. The Court found that the Tribunal was therefore entitled to reopen its proceedings and revisit its previous order.\n[20] Consistent with this reasoning, the Tribunal in Goyette v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9(es) de terminus de Voyageur Colonial limit\u00e9e (CSN), 2001 CanLII 8495 (C.H.R.T.), recognized that the rule of functus officio prevented it from reopening an inquiry regarding an issue in respect of which it had not reserved jurisdiction.\n[21] Turning to the present case, the Tribunal did not retain any jurisdiction to deal with any issue, except remedies, in its liability decision. The decision was clearly final, even though it was amended to deal with a mathematical error.\n[22] The exceptions to the functus officio rule articulated in Chandler however, should apply to the people listed as Nos. 414 to 417 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto since I find that their exclusion from the List suggested by the Respondents was either a slip in how the liability decision was drawn up or represented an error in the expression of the Tribunal\u2019s manifest intention in its liability decision. I am unable to find that the persons listed as Nos. 418 to 427, inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto have a similar claim of status for the reasons set out in paragraph 16 herein, namely that there is no evidence of any complaint for them being filed with the Commission and referred to the Tribunal and that their names were first presented during the remedies hearing after the liability decision was rendered, but they were never accepted as being part of the List by the Respondents or the Tribunal.\n[23] For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the people listed as Nos. 1 to 417 inclusive in Schedule A attached hereto are the correct persons to be on the List of Complainants.\n[24] As noted in paragraph 11 (4), the Tribunal retained jurisdiction with respect to the question of the quantum of the reasonable Counsel costs in its remedies Decision. The parties have not agreed on the quantum and have requested a Ruling on this matter as well.\n[25] Subsequent to the rendering of the remedies Decision by the Tribunal, the Court of Appeal on the 26th day of October, 2009 released its Decision in Mowat wherein it held that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to award legal costs. An Application for Leave to appeal the Mowat Decision was granted by the Supreme Court of Canada on the 22nd day of April, 2010. Under the circumstances, it is appropriate and in the interests of justice that the Tribunal waits until the Supreme Court of Canada has rendered a Decision in the Mowat case. Thereafter, if the Supreme Court of Canada issues a judgment that clearly establishes the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to award legal costs in the present case before me, the Tribunal will receive submissions with respect to quantum.\nSigned by Edward P.

Tettaut, Anna Malec, Estelle Kaltush and Germaine Mest\u00e9nap\u00e9ao, Innu from the Montagnais community of Natashquan, (the complainants) filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, alleging discrimination in employment based on their race, national or ethnic origin, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. (1985), c. H-6 (the Act) by the Conseil des Montagnais de Nutashkuan (the respondent). Three of the complainants, \u00c9velyne Malec, Sylvie Malec and Estelle Kaltush, also allege that the respondent retaliated or threatened retaliation against them following the filing of their complaints, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act.\n[2] The complainant \u00c9velyne Malec is a special education teacher at Uauitshitun School in the Innu community of Nutashkuan. Since 2001, except for the 2003-2004 school year, she has been continuously employed at this school. Ms. Malec's employment contract indicates she has a bachelor's degree in education and certificates in Aboriginal studies and Amerindian teaching. Ms. Malec's spouse is Richard Boies. They have been married since 2003. Mr. Boies is also a teacher at Uauitshitun School.\n[3] The complainant Anne Bellefleur-Tettaut is an Innu teacher for grades 1 to 6 at Uauitshitun School. She taught from 1983, except for the 2003-2004 school year. Ms. Bellefleur\u2011Tettaut retired in June 2007. The complainant does not have a bachelor's degree, but has a teacher's certificate and a teacher's permit.\n[4] Estelle Kaltush has a bachelor's degree in education. Since 1990, except for four years, she has been teaching at Uauitshitun School. Ms. Kaltush held the position of vice principal from 2003 to 2009 and the position of acting principal from January to June 2007.\n[5] Anna Malec is a kindergarten teacher at Uauitshitun School. She earned her bachelor's degree in education from the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi in 1985. Since then, except for the 2003-2004 school year, she has been working at the community school.\n[6] Marceline Kaltush has a bachelor's degree in education, which she obtained in 1985. Since 1990, she has been teaching at Uauitshitun School.\n[7] Sylvie Malec has been teaching at Uauitshitun School since January 2003, except for the 2003-2004 school year. She teaches Innu. She does not have a bachelor's degree.\n[8] The complainant Monique Ishpatao has a bachelor's degree in preschool and primary school education. Since 1990, except for the 2003-2004 year, she has been teaching at Uauitshitun School.\n[9] Germaine Mest\u00e9nap\u00e9ao did not appear, nor did she offer any testimony at the hearing.\n[10] The complainants were represented at the hearing by Richard Boies, a co-worker and, as noted above, the complainant \u00c9velyne Malec's husband. The respondent was represented by Maurice Dussault, counsel from the law firm Dussault Larochelle Gervais Thivierge.\n[11] The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not participate in the hearing.\nI. Facts Related to the Allegation of Discrimination A. The Innu community of Nutashkuan [12] Located on the shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Innu community of Nutashkuan is 376 kilometres east of Sept-\u00celes, in the province of Quebec. The community's territory has a common border with the municipality of Natashquan and has been accessible by route 138 since 1996. The community's population is around 1,000.\n[13] The Innu community of Nutashkuan has the infrastructure usually found in Aboriginal communities, including a school. Before 1990, this school was administered by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (DIAND). Since 1990, the school has been under the respondent's authority. The respondent designated a councillor to take responsibility for the education sector. At the time relevant to this case, Nicolas Wapistan had this designation.\n[14] Uauitshitun School has around 160 students: 60 in the secondary division and 102 in the primary division. The teaching staff is composed of 11 teachers at the secondary level and 8 at the primary level. Of the 19 teachers, 9 are Innu.\n[15] For many years, Uauitshitun School has had a high turnover rate among principals. They changed yearly, which complicated relations between the administration and the teachers.\n[16] The neighbouring village of Natashquan also has a school, \u00c9cole Roger-Martineau. This provincial school is under the responsibility of Quebec's Moyenne-C\u00f4te-Nord school board. Roger-Martineau School is around five kilometres from Uauitshitun School. It has close to 108 primary and secondary students. The proportion of Innu students enrolled at the primary school level at Roger-Martineau is around 75% and at the secondary level, 70%. This school offers preschool to Secondary III programs. In Secondary IV and V, students attend Monseigneur-Labrie school in Havre-Saint-Pierre, a community located around 150 kilometres from Natashquan.\n[17] As of March 31, 2005, the respondent had accumulated a budget deficit that exceeded $5 million. As a result, at the beginning of April 2005, DIAND appointed a co\u2011manager to administer the respondent's finances. In October 2005, noting that despite the appointment of the co\u2011manager, the financial situation was not improving, DIAND decided to appoint a third party to administer funds so the money used to provide services to the community members would not be seized by the respondent's creditors. A few weeks later, the Health Canada did the same.\n[18] DIAND and Health Canada appointed the firm BDL Conseiller en administration as the third party manager. Dominique Blackburn was BDL's representative for this third party management, which has three components:\ndeliver essential services to the members of the community; help the respondent prepare its debt repayment plan; act as facilitator between the main partners, suppliers, financial institutions and departments.\n[19] Starting October 1, 2005, all the respondent's expenses had to be pre-approved by the third party manager, including those in the education sector.\n[20] Following the appointment of the third party manager, the respondent submitted a plan to adjust its finances and implement an organizational structure and administrative policies that would allow it to provide services to the members of the community. This remedial management plan was submitted to and adopted by DIAND in 2006. The plan showed that, among others, education budgets had to be adjusted because the sector had accumulated significant deficits over the previous years. The problems in the education sector had resulted in many parents in the Nutashkuan community deciding to take their children out of the community school and instead sending them to Roger-Martineau School in the village of Natashquan. Since educational funding in Aboriginal communities is based on number of students, having many students leave for the Moyenne C\u00f4te-Nord school board resulted in a significant annual shortfall for the education sector.\n[21] In addition to the administrative and financial measures, under the band's remedial management plan, it was also to update and develop various administrative and financial policies. To this end, a financial management policy and a human resources management policy (including the education sector) were submitted in the fall of 2007. The purpose of these policies was to bring order to the administration of services the respondent provided and to the treatment of employees.\n[22] Since March 31, 2009, DIAND has removed the third party management. Health Canada has decided to maintain third party management for some time. Where DIAND is concerned, the respondent is now under co-management.\n[23] Andr\u00e9 Barrette also worked for the third party manager, BDL. He testified that he did not personally know the complainants and he did not receive any specific instructions from his superiors regarding the education sector. He said he was informed of the complaints by Jules Wapistan, the respondent's financial and administration coordinator. The issues regarding employees were the responsibility of Mr. Wapistan and Dominique Blackburn, from BDL. Mr. Blackburn was not called as a witness.\nB. Allegations of Discrimination [24] In June 2005, treatment of employees at Uauitshitun School was governed by a document called, Entente intervenue entre le Conseil des Montagnais de Nutashkuan et le personnel de l\u0092\u00c9cole Uauitshitun de Nutashkuan \u0096 Convention r\u00e9ciproque de traitement du personnel de l\u0092\u00c9cole Uauitshitun de Nutashkuan [Agreement between the Montagnais de Nutashkuan Band Council and Employees at the Uauitshitun School in Nutashkuan\u0097Mutual Agreement on the Treatment of Employees at the Uauitshitun School in Nutashkuan]. According to the evidence, it seems that a similar policy had been in force since at least 1990, the year the school came under the respondent's responsibility. This agreement included the following provisions:\n[Translation]\n3.13 Place of permanent residence?\nResidence in the legal sense of the term at the time of hiring, insomuch as the residence is located in the province of Quebec.\n6.5 Isolated post allowance to teaching staff with at least a bachelor's degree and to professional employees with the same level of education.\n6.51 The annual isolated post allowance is credited to the employee in 26 bi\u2011monthly payments at the pay period.\n6.5.2 The rate of the annual isolated post allowance is granted to the employee based on whether the employee has a dependent (minor dependent child) residing permanently at the workplace residence or is considered without dependents.\n6.5.3 Rate of isolated post allowance:\nWith dependent child(ren): $6,000 Without dependent child: $3,000.\nN.B. If two employees are married or are common-law spouses, only one of the two may claim the isolated post allowance with dependent child (if the conditions are met) and the other employee shall receive the allowance for an employee without a dependent child.\n8.4 Allowances for annual outings for employees hired outside a 50 km radius.\n8.4.1 Allowances are provided for three annual outings.\n8.4.2 Except by special authorization from the school's administration, the schedule for outings is:\n- 1st outing: Start date at the beginning of the year and vacation departure - 2nd outing: Christmas - 3rd outing: Easter or spring break.\n8.4.3 Amount of allowance\n8.4.3.-I The allowance for annual outings is as follows, according to the city of residence at the time the employee was hired, and is for a round trip:\nMontr\u00e9al: $950 Qu\u00e9bec: $750 Sept-\u00celes: $300.\n8.4.3.-II For other locations, the allowance is adjusted based on the three cities with set allowances under the preceding paragraph.\n8.4.4 Payments occur at least 5 working days before the effective date of the annual outing.\n8.6 Housing allowance\n8.6.1 The council provides a monthly housing allowance to employees according to the following terms:\n8.6.2 Monthly allocation: $450.\n8.6.3 When two or more employees share a domestic residence, the sharing must be proportional.\n[25] In 2007, the respondent adopted its Politique des ressources humaines \u0096 Personnel de l\u0092\u00e9cole Uauitshitun[Human Resources Policy\u0097Employees at Uauitshitun School] that replaced the 2005 agreement. According to the complainants, this policy was not accepted by the teachers at Uauitshitun School. They also allege that the new policy was never adopted by the respondent. No evidence was submitted to the Tribunal that suggests the policy had to be approved by the teachers to be effective. As to the issue of whether the respondent formally adopted the policy, it was never truly clarified at the hearing. Whatever the case, it seems clear that as of February 2007, everyone behaved as if this policy were in force.\n[26] The following is provided under this policy:\n[Translation]\n4.15 Resident\nAny person working for the Council whose ordinary and main place of residence and\/or that of his or her spouse is Nutashkuan or is less than 50 km from Nutashkuan shall be considered a resident within the meaning of the employment policy of the Council.\nThe employee's residence status may change during the course of employment and the Council reserves the right to reassess the residence status of its employees in the education sector yearly.\n(Section 55 of the Canada Elections Act defines place of ordinary residence as: The place of ordinary residence of a person is the place that has always been, or that has been adopted as, his or her dwelling place, and to which the person intends to return when away from it.)\n10.7 Isolated post allowance for non-resident teaching staff and professional employees\nThe annual isolated post allowance is credited to the employee in 26 bi\u2011monthly payments at the pay period. The rate of the annual isolated post allowance is granted to the employee based on whether the employee has at least one dependent (dependent minor child) who resides permanently at the workplace residence or is considered without dependents. Rate of isolated post allowance:\nWith dependent child(ren): $6,000 Without dependent child: $3,000.\n10.7.1 If two employees are married or are common-law spouses, only one of the two may claim the isolated post allowance with a dependent child (if the conditions are met) and the other employee shall receive the allowance for an employee without a dependent child.\n10.8 Allowances for annual outings for non-resident employees\na. Three (3) annual outings at the following times or by special authorization from the school's administration:\n1st outing: Start date at the beginning of the year and departure for vacation.\n2nd outing: Christmas\n3rd outing: Easter or spring break.\nb. The allowance for annual outings is as follows, depending on the where the non-resident employee was hired and is for a return trip:\nMontr\u00e9al: $850 Qu\u00e9bec: $750 Sept-\u00celes: $300\nN.B. Allowances for other locations shall be pro-rated to adjust for the distance from the closest city indicated above.\nc. The payment will be made at least five working days before the effective date of the annual outing.\n10.10 Housing allowance for non-resident employees\n10.10.1 Monthly allowance\nThe Council grants a monthly housing allowance to non-resident employees on the following terms:\n10.10.2 Monthly allowance: $450\n10.10.3 When two non-resident employees are common-law spouses or married persons, they allowance from a single allowance of $450.00. The employee is responsible for his or her own rent and lease.\n10.10.4 When two employees live in the same residence, a single housing allowance is granted and half is paid to each member occupying the residence.\n10.10.5 When the Council rents one of its unheated and furnished units, the monthly rent is $200.\n[27] According to the evidence, until 2007, all non-Aboriginal teachers at Uauitshitun School and one Aboriginal teacher, received these allowances. The Aboriginal teacher who had received the allowance worked at Uauitshitun School for one year. This teacher, who was not Aboriginal by birth, was married to an Aboriginal person, an Attikamek, and had acquired Aboriginal status as a result, pursuant to the Indian Act. The respondent would use this exception to claim its policy was not discriminatory towards Aboriginal teachers.\n[28] On February 21, 2007, some non-Aboriginal teachers living within 50 kilometres received a letter from the school's administration informing them that under the respondent's new policy, an employee [Translation] must live outside a 50 km radius to be entitled to the housing and outing allowances. The letter also stated that the school's administration had noticed that certain teachers who were receiving the allowances had a permanent residence inside this zone. Those teachers were therefore no longer admissible for the $450 a month allowance for rent or for the three annual outings. The letter also informed the teachers that starting February 22, 2007, they would no longer be receiving an allowance for these allowances and they were to repay certain amounts they had mistakenly been paid from the beginning of the 2006-2007 school year. The letter makes no mention of the isolated post allowance. However, article 10.7 of the new policy clearly states that the isolated post allowance would only be paid to non-resident teachers from that point on.\n[29] The complainants allege that the respondent's policy regarding these allowances discriminates against Innu teachers because they do not have the right to the same benefits as those granted to non-Aboriginal teachers.\nC. Legal Context [30] The purpose of the Act is stated at section 2:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[31] Human rights legislation has been described as of a special nature, not quite constitutional but certainly more than the ordinary (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R., para. 12). The Supreme Court of Canada elaborated on the purpose and objectives of this legislation and the manner in which they were to be interpreted, in Canadian National Railway v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 to 1134 (sub nomine: Action Travail des Femmes):\nHuman rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact.\n[32] Section 7 of the Act states that it is a discriminatory practice to differentiate adversely in relation to an individual in the course of employment on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Under section 3, prohibited grounds of discrimination include race, religion and national or ethnic origin.\n[33] Since the Supreme Court decisions in British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 [also referred to as Meiorin] and British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 [also referred to as Grismer], the classical distinction between direct discrimination and indirect discrimination has been replaced by a unified approach to analyzing human rights complaints. Under this analysis, the complainant must first establish prima facie evidence of discrimination. P rima facie evidence is evidence that covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of a reply from the respondent.\n[34] Once prima facie evidence of discrimination has been established, the onus is on the respondent to prove that no prohibited grounds were present in the respondent's behaviour or to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a bona fide justification for the discriminatory standard or policy. To do this, the respondent must prove that:\nIt adopted the standard for a purpose or goal rationally connected to the performance of the job. The focus at this step is not on the validity of the particular standard, but on the validity of its more general purpose. It adopted the particular standard in the sincere belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of the legitimate work-related purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. At this stage, the focus shifts from the general purpose of the standard to the standard itself. The contested standard is reasonably necessary to accomplish its goal. The employer must demonstrate that it cannot accommodate the claimant and others affected by the standard without suffering undue hardship. (See, in particular, section 15 of the Act.)\n[35] In this case, the complainants must first establish prima facie evidence that they were adversely differentiated against in the course of employment based on their race or national or ethnic origin. As stated above, prima facie evidence covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of a reply from the respondent (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28).\n[36] The complainants submit that they were discriminated against because of their Aboriginal status, compared to the non-Aboriginal teachers. They claim specifically that the respondent adversely differentiated against them in the course of employment by disallowing certain benefits to them that were granted to non-Aboriginal teachers. They refer, in particular, to the housing and isolated post allowances and those for the outings provided for in the respondent's policy.\n[37] The respondent claims in its reply that the complainants did not establish prima facie evidence of discrimination. It did not submit evidence that there was a bona fide justification for the policy in question within the meaning of Meiorin and Grismer. In his final arguments, counsel for the respondent claimed that allowing the complainants' requests would impose a burden on his client that would send the community back into a financial crisis. But, again, no tangible evidence was submitted to support this claim.\n(i) Isolated Post Allowance [38] Until February 2007, the policy that applied to teachers at Uauitshitun School provided for an isolated post allowance to members of the teaching staff that held at least a bachelor's degree and to professional employees with the same education, regardless of the distance between their permanent place of residence and the school. The amount of the allowance varied based on whether the teacher had dependent children ($6,000) residing permanently with him or her, or was considered without dependents ($3,000). Moreover, the policy established that if two employees were married or common-law spouses, only one of the two could claim the isolated post allowance for dependent children, and the other employee would receive the isolated post allowance without dependent children.\n[39] The Tribunal notes that in regard to the isolated post allowance, the policy does not distinguish between resident or non-resident employees. Nothing in the policy indicates that it is paid as an allowance to recruit or to help recruit teachers from outside the Natashquan region.\n[40] Moreover, it is clear that the only teachers who received this allowance were non\u2011Aboriginal teachers, although once, it was paid to an Aboriginal teacher whose status had been acquired under the Indian Act.\n[41] The respondent did not submit any evidence to explain the origin or underlying reason for this allowance. During his closing statements, counsel for the respondent essentially relied on the testimony of certain complainants who had testified that the isolated post allowance had been paid to non-Aboriginal teachers from outside the area to conclude that these statements were admissions about the rationale for the allowance and that its payment to only certain teachers could not be considered discriminatory. The Tribunal cannot agree with this conclusion. The fact that certain complainants made this statement cannot lead to a justification of the policy regarding the payment of these allowances. The Tribunal considers that by giving these answers, the complainants were simply stating a fact known to everyone in the teaching staff: that non\u2011Aboriginal teachers received this allowance. Moreover, the uncontested evidence clearly shows that until February 2007, non-Aboriginal teachers permanently residing in the Natashquan region received the allowance. The fact that a teacher with Aboriginal status had, at one time, received the allowance, does not change our finding. The respondent did not submit any evidence to the Tribunal that justified why the allowance was not paid to Innu teachers at Uauitshitun School.\n[42] In 2007, the respondent adopted a human resources policy for Uauitshitun School employees, which replaced the 2005 agreement. Under this policy, any person working for the respondent and whose ordinary place of residence is Nutashkuan or within 50 km from Nutashkuan shall be considered a resident.\n[43] As for the isolated post allowance, we note that there was little change in the new policy except that under article 10.7, the allowance was paid only to non-resident teachers. Now, the policy no longer differentiates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal teachers. The distinction is based solely on place of residence.\n[44] Considering all the evidence submitted at the hearing, the Tribunal finds that the complainants established prima facie evidence that until 2007, they were adversely differentiated against because of their race by the respondent's refusal to grant them an isolated post allowance, when such an allowance was paid to all non-Aboriginal resident teachers.\n[45] The burden is now on the respondent to show, on a balance of probabilities, that there was a bona fide justification to deny the complainants the isolated post allowance. The respondent did not submit any evidence to justify this unfair treatment. Moreover, the respondent did not submit any evidence to show that the treatment was due to the permanent residence of the recipients rather than their race\/ethnic or national origin. The so-called admissions by the complainants have no probative value that would allow such a conclusion or practice.\n[46] As a result, the Tribunal finds that the complainants established prima facie evidence that before 2007, they were adversely differentiated against in the course of employment because of their race, contrary to section 7 of the Act, by the treatment they received from the respondent when it refused to pay an isolated post allowance although such an allowance was paid to all non\u2011Aboriginal teachers, residents or not.\n(ii) Annual Outing Allowance [47] Before 2007, the agreement with the teaching staff provided an allowance for annual outings for employees from outside a 50-kilometre radius of Natashquan. There are three allowances for the annual outings and the schedule is as follows: first outing -entry into duty at the start of the year and departure for vacation; second outing - Christmas; and third outing - Easter or spring break. The amount of the annual outing allowance is based on the city of residence at the time the employee was hired, and is for a round trip: Montr\u00e9al, $950; Qu\u00e9bec, $750 and Sept-\u00celes, $300.\n[48] It is clear from the wording of the policy that this allowance applies to employees whose residence is more than 50 kilometres from Natashquan. The new policy adopted in 2007 makes no changes to this, other than defining the expression resident more precisely. Although the respondent might have paid this allowance to teachers residing within 50 kilometres in the past-as was the case, for example, with Richard Boies\u0097it is clear that the intent of the allowance is to allow non-resident teachers to be able to return to their city of residence at least three times a year. As for payments that were made to ineligible teachers, it seems the February 2007 letter intended to correct this situation.\n[49] With regard to the payment of this allowance, the Tribunal cannot find that the complainants established prima facie evidence that they were adversely differentiated against because of their race by the respondent's refusal to pay an allowance for annual outings. None of the evidence showed that any of the complainants or any Innu teacher residing outside a 50\u2011kilometre radius was denied this allowance.\n[50] As a result, the Tribunal finds that the complainants did not establish prima facie evidence that they were adversely differentiated against in the course of employment due to their race by the respondent's refusal to grant them an annual outing allowance for teachers residing outside a 50-kilometre radius of Natashquan.\n(iii) Housing Allowance [51] Under the policy in force before 2007, the Council would grant a monthly housing allowance of $450 to its teachers. Nothing in the policy indicates that the allowance is paid only to teachers not residing in Natashquan or inside a 50-kilometre radius of Natashquan. The policy adopted in 2007 now grants this monthly allowance solely to non-resident employees, namely those living outside a 50-kilometre radius of Natashquan.\n[52] Until 2007, all non-Aboriginal teachers received this housing allowance. Aboriginal teachers, with the exception of the teacher we mentioned above who had Aboriginal status, did not receive this allowance. In 2007, as was the case with the annual outings allowance, non\u2011Aboriginal teachers residing inside the 50-kilometre radius were advised they would no longer receive this allowance. As a result, as of 2007, it is no longer possible to state that non\u2011Aboriginal teachers are the only ones not receiving this allowance.\n[53] Can the respondent's refusal to pay this allowance to Aboriginal teachers, until 2007, be considered a discriminatory practice contrary to section 7 of the Act?\n[54] The evidence submitted at the hearing established that the purpose of the allowance was to help non-resident teachers pay the cost of their housing in the village of Natashquan or nearby. Genevi\u00e8ve Tacshereau-N\u00e9aschit, a witness for the respondent, testified that it is rather difficult for teachers from outside the area to find adequate housing at a reasonable price in the region. This evidence was not challenged by the complainants.\n[55] As for the complainants, who all live on the territory of the Innu community Nutashkuan, except for \u00c9velyne Malec, the evidence shows they benefitted from some housing-related allowances. Determining whether they are appropriate is not for the Tribunal to decide. Regardless, they still benefitted from the respondent's housing policy, which the non-Innu teachers could not. Moreover, none of the complainants testified that they paid $450 or more per month for their accommodations. Some even testified that they paid nothing at all. As for \u00c9velyne Malec, the evidence showed that she could not receive this allowance because during the period of her employment, her spouse, Richard Boies, received the allowance of $450 a month.\n[56] Whatever the case, based on the evidence, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the complainants established prima facie evidence that they were adversely differentiated against in the course of employment based on their race by the respondent's policy to pay a monthly allowance to non-Aboriginal teachers.\nII. Allegations of Retaliation A. The Law [57] Before the hearing started, the complainants filed a motion to amend their complaint to add allegations that the respondent retaliated against several of them contrary to section 14.1 of the Act. The Tribunal granted this motion in the ruling Malec et al. v. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2009 CHRT 5.\n[58] Pursuant to section 14.1 of the Act, it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[59] Retaliation implies some form of wilful conduct meant to harm or hurt the person who filed a human rights complaint for having filed the complaint. As the Tribunal noted in Virk v. Bell Canada (Ontario), 2005 CHRT 2, at paragraph 156: This view departs in part from those expressed in previous decisions of this Tribunal on the issue of retaliation (Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, [2001] CHRT 11; Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 40 (CanLII), 2004 CHRT 40). In Bressette and Wong, the Tribunal found that a complainant did not have to prove an intention to retaliate. It had only to show it reasonably perceived the impugned conduct by the respondent to be in retaliation quite apart from any proven intention of the respondent. In this case, the Tribunal adopts the approach set out in Virk.\n[60] In the case of allegations of retaliation, it is the complainant who has the burden of proving retaliation actually took place. The complainant must therefore prove that the person or persons it claims retaliated knew of the existence of the complaint and that this person or persons acted in an inopportune way and the conduct of that person or persons was motivated by the filing of the complaint.\n[61] As a result, what is required is proof that the respondent or its representative retaliated and knew of the existence of the complaint and that the respondent or its representative acted in an inopportune way, giving rise to a prima facie case. Once this prima facie case is established, it becomes the respondent's responsibility to give a reasonable explanation for its actions. If the explanation is not credible, the Tribunal should find that the allegation of retaliation is substantiated.\nB. Facts Regarding the Allegation of Retaliation (Section 14.1 of the Act) [62] At the hearing, the agent for the complainants stated that the allegations of retaliation had been made solely by the complainants \u00c9velyne Malec, Sylvie Malec and Estelle Kaltush. The alleged retaliation essentially consisted of disciplinary action, taken between September 9, 2008, and December 16, 2008. The details of the incidents that support the allegations of retaliation for each of the complainants follow.\n(i) \u00c9velyne Malec [63] The evidence the complainant submitted in support of her allegations of retaliation focus on her relationship with the principal of Uauitshitun School, Marcel Rodrigue.\n[64] Mr. Rodrigue was officially hired as the school's principal at the end of August 2008, a few days before the start of the school year. From the beginning, relations between the new principal and the complainant were strained. For example, Ms. Malec states that at their first meeting, the new principal said, [Translation] You're Ms. Malec? I have heard a lot about you. A little later,, she claims he said, [Translation] Are you \u00c9velyne Malec? I've been hearing lots of things about you. She also added that he told her, [Translation] there are going to be anti-establishment protestors. Although at the time he did not mention the proceedings undertaken pursuant to the Act, the complainant is sure that he was aware of them because [Translation] there are no secrets at BDL.\n[65] Mr. Rodrigue confirmed that before accepting the position as principal, he had discussed the situation at Uauitshitun School with his predecessor. He had told him to be ready [Translation] to manage opposition, because you are going to be facing some. He added that during this conversation there was never any talk of the complaints or complainants.\n[66] As for Ms. Malec's allegations of retaliation, the first incident allegedly occurred on August 28, 2008. That day, the complainant was called to a meeting by the principal. He informed her that another teacher had filed an internal complaint against her following an altercation they allegedly had the previous day. According to the complainant, the principal did not reprimand her during this meeting. She said she gave him her version of the facts regarding the altercation. The principal indicated that it confirmed what the other teacher had described in her letter. According to the complainant, he even added that he [Translation] appreciated her honesty. However, later in her cross-examination, she added, [Translation] He [the principal] was always rude to me. From my first meeting, he has always been rude, he treats me like I am nothing. From her description of this meeting, it is difficult to conclude that the principal acted impolitely with her. The mere fact he said he appreciated her honesty seems contrary to an attitude of rudeness or ungratefulness.\n[67] On September 3, 2008, Ms. Malec received a verbal warning from Mr. Rodrigue about the altercation of August 27, 2008. The complainant indicated that the principal blamed her for the incident.\n[68] During his testimony, Mr. Rodrigue stated that on September 3, he had no knowledge of the complaints that had been filed under the Act. He added he only heard about these complaints for the first time near the end of October 2008 at a meeting of the teaching staff. Someone had mentioned the complaints at that time, but he added that it didn't mean anything to him because [Translation] in my mind, it was not my responsibility. I did not know who was involved in this recourse. He added that in May 2009, the complainant \u00c9velyne Malec, informed him that he would be summoned to a legal proceeding at the beginning of June, but stated he did not know what she was talking about. He said that in early June he noticed that many teachers were absent. The school secretary then informed him they were attending the hearing. He said he was not formally informed of the proceedings or who the complainants were until the end of June or beginning of July 2009. I cannot easily accept this part of Mr. Rodrigue's testimony. The Innu community of Natashquan is not very large. The school is also fairly small. When eight teachers file a discrimination complaint together, even in a very large school, it would seem highly unlikely to me that the administration would not know about it. I understand that Mr. Rodrigue might not have felt involved in the complaints he considered were the respondent's or the third\u2011party manager's responsibility, but from there to be claiming he did not even know about it is a big stretch.\n[69] On September 9, 2008, the complainant received a written warning. The letter began by stating, [Translation] [i]n September 2007, [the principal] met with you to give you a verbal warning to control your mood swings, to tone down and moderate your remarks following a meeting between teachers and the school's administration. It went on to say, [Translation] Despite this warning, we learned from information provided to us and from our observations that your attitude has not changed and you continue to act in an unacceptable manner. The letter then described another incident that allegedly occurred between Ms. Malec and the teacher involved in the first altercation. After meeting with both teachers, the administration concluded: [Translation] We consider the comments made during this altercation to be a serious lack of respect, a violation of the rules of ethics stated in the Manuel des politiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de gestion des ressources humaines du conseil des Innus de Nutashkuan. As a result, please consider this letter to be a written warning If corrections are not made, we will have to proceed with the third step of disciplinary action, namely suspension.\n[70] Mr. Rodrigue stated that this letter was written following a meting at which Andr\u00e9 Barette, from BDL, Jules Wapistan, Nicolas Wapistan, and Estelle Kaltush were present. The four other participants did not mention this meeting in their testimony. According to Mr. Rodrigue, this is when he was informed that the former principal, Andr\u00e9 Leclerc, had given Ms. Malec a verbal warning. However, Andr\u00e9 Leclerc testified that he did not know about any conflicts with \u00c9velyne Malec that required interventions or disciplinary measures.\n[71] According to the complainant, the claim that she received a verbal warning in 2007 is false. She stated that before September 3, 2008, there had been no disciplinary measures against her. The Tribunal notes that no evidence was submitted about disciplinary measures against the complainant \u00c9velyne Malec in September 2007 during the hearing. Moreover, during his testimony, Marcel Rodrigue stated that he found nothing in Ms. Malec's records about a verbal warning during that period.\n[72] Mr. Rodrigue also testified that after this letter was sent out, he received a visit from Richard Boies, \u00c9velyne Malec and Nicolas Wapistan at his office. He added that Estelle Kaltush also joined in on the meeting. Then, he said he received [Translation] quite an outburst from \u00c9velyne Malec and Richard Boies.\n[73] The September 9, 2008, written warning was signed not only by the school's principal, Marcel Rodrigue, but also by the vice principal, Estelle Kaltush, one of the complainants. In cross-examination, Ms. Malec testified that Estelle Kaltush had told her she signed the letter under pressure from the employer. However, Ms. Malec was not able to indicate which person applied this pressure and stated she did not ask Ms. Kaltush this question. Mr. Rodrigue testified that he has no recollection of Ms. Kaltush had any reservations when she signed the letter. Ms. Kaltush was not questioned on this issue.\n[74] On October 14, 2008, Mr. Rodrigue sent a letter to Dominique Blackburn, the third-party manager's representative. He said he felt the need to explain what was happening to his employer. In this letter, he notes the following events:\n[Translation]\nRe: \u00c9velyne Malec\n9 September\nwritten warning for lack of respect.\n17 September\ntelephone threat by Francis Malec, \u00c9velyne's brother.\n7 October\nmeeting of secondary teachers. \u00c9velyne was disrespectful of me at that meeting. She called me dense (bouch\u00e9) on two occasions. She said I was harassing her. This happened when I tried to answer Jacques Devost's question about employee departures.\n10 October\nI met with \u00c9velyne Malec in my office to inform her of my intention to give her a suspension notice.\n10 October\nNicolas phoned Estelle so she could tell me to resolve my issues with \u00c9velyne.\n[75] Mr. Rodrigue also testified, although he did not specify the date, that he was informed that some teachers had requested a meeting with the band council to discuss him. Without giving a name, he said that someone suggested he meet with the teachers to discuss the issue. Two meetings were then organized with the teachers: one with the primary teachers, chaired by Estelle Kaltush, and another with the secondary teachers, chaired by Mr. Rodrigue. According to Mr. Rodrigue, while he was answering a question asked by another teacher, the complainant, \u00c9velyne Malec, [Translation] had a fit and said, [Translation] he was dense (bouch\u00e9) and was harassing her. On October 20, 2008, after the meeting, Mr. Rodrigue wrote to Jules Wapistan to describe the incident.\n[76] On October 21, 2008, Ms. Malec received a letter from Jules Wapistan, informing her she was suspended without pay for five days. The reasons stated for this suspension were: [Translation] At the beginning of September 2008, you received a verbal warning ordering you to control your mood swings, tone down and moderate your remarks. On September 9, 2008, you received a written warning ordering you to take on a more positive attitude, be polite and respect your coworkers and members of the administration. Disregarding this written warning, on October 7, 2008, twice you called the school principal [Translation] dense (bouch\u00e9). There is no doubt you did not care at all about the warnings you received because you did not change your inappropriate behaviour at all, and made disrespectful comments to the school's principal. The letter also indicated that the complainant was [Translation] suspended from [her] duties, without pay, for the period starting October 20, 2008, until October 24, 2008.\n[77] Regarding this letter, the Tribunal notes that the start date of the suspension (October 20, 2008) precedes the date of the letter, October 21, 2008. This most likely explains the new letter dated October 27, 2008, in which Mr. Wapistan writes, [Translation] we sent you a notice of suspension and mistakenly indicated in that notice that you would be suspended from October 20 to 24, 2008. That notice was sent by mail, and therefore, you worked that entire week. The letter advised the complainant that her suspension without pay would be effective for the period of November 17 to 21, 2008.\n[78] However, on November 17, 2008, the complainant was on sick leave. On November 17, 2008, Mr. Wapistan wrote to the complainant again: [Translation] Considering your absence for medical reasons, please be advised that your suspension will take effect upon your return to work, for the entire period of one normal work week.\n[79] Despite these incidents with the principal, the complainant explained that her performance evaluation by the principal, Marcel Rodrigue [Translation] went very well. She added that he [Translation] found her competent although he did state that she had [Translation] strained relations with the principal. We assume Ms. Malec was referring to her evaluation for the 2008-2009 school year, because that was the only year Mr. Rodrigue was the school's principal. If there is a written version of this evaluation, she did not submit it as evidence at the hearing. The Tribunal notes, however, that the respondent did not challenge this evidence.\n[80] Ms. Malec also recounted an incident that allegedly took place on September 8, 2008, during a meeting with the teaching staff and the principal. She stated that because of family obligations, she and her husband arrived late to the meeting. She added that Mr. Rodrigue then asked them to write the time they arrived at the school beside their names on the attendance list. During the meeting, the discussion addressed the school calendar. At one point, according to Ms. Malec, the principal asked for a volunteer to work with him to review the calendar. Nobody volunteered, so she indicated that she [Translation] wanted to do it. The principal allegedly replied, [Translation] not you. She said that she asked for a reason for his refusal and that he replied that [Translation] nobody had delegated her.\n[81] Mr. Rodrigue gave a slightly different interpretation of the events at that meeting. He testified that the school calendar must include 180 days of classes. During the school year, five days on Innu culture are usually organized. Mr. Rodrigue said he talked about [Translation] these culture days with the former principal and he told him they were not considered class days. However, the vice-principal, Estelle Kaltush, stated the opposite. To clarify things, the principal decided to have separate meetings with the primary and secondary teachers. According to Mr. Rodrigue, the meeting with the primary teachers went well, and they agreed to remove the afternoon recess periods to cover the missing school hours. As for the secondary group, things were not as simple. The secondary teachers felt the culture days were class days. At the meeting, Mr. Rodrigue said he recalls that the complainant offered to help work on preparing the school calendar. He remembers he did not accept her offer because she had not been designated by the other teachers. In his testimony, he explained his decision to not accept the complainant's offer to help saying, [Translation] I wasn't at that point yet. I needed to do some of my own verifications and would get back to that later.\n[82] The complainant also testified that on November 27, 2008, Jules Wapistan allegedly informed her that she would receive a new disciplinary letter because she did not calculate, [Translation] the minutes in her work schedule. Ms. Malec stated that she then went to see Marie-Anna Wapistan, the secondary principal, to whom she had given her schedule with the [Translation] calculation of her minutes and in fact, the document in question was found. Mr. Wapistan testified that he did not know the complainant had given her schedule to the secondary principal and after verification he saw it was true. For him, the situation was therefore resolved.\n(ii) Estelle Kaltush [83] Estelle Kaltush also alleges she was retaliated against because of the complaint filed.\n[84] Among other things, she alleges that an oral warning she received from her principal on November 28, 2008, was an act of retaliation. This warning was given to her following an incident that allegedly took place on November 27. According to the letter, the complainant kicked the principal out of her office when he wanted to discuss the [Translation] relocating her office. The principal felt that the complainant showed [Translation] serious disrespect and was impolite.\n[85] On January 26, 2009, the complainant received a written notice regarding an incident that allegedly occurred on January 22, 2009. That day, the principal met with a student who had discipline problems. According to him, the intervention plan with this student included the assistance of a psychoeducator from the school who had already met with the student. Shortly after this meeting, the psychoeducator informed the principal that the student's grandfather was coming to the school to meet with him. This meeting was not part of the intervention plan the principal had prepared. During the meeting, which included the grandfather, the psychoeducator, the student, the complainant and the principal, the grandfather informed the participants that it was the complainant who had called him to come and meet with the principal. According to the principal, the complainant had involved herself in a disciplinary case that was his responsibility and had compromised the success of his intervention plan with that student. He stated that by acting in that way, the complainant did not show a cooperative spirit. He added that the complainant was disrespectful to him. According to the principal, the complainant's attitude and behaviour warranted a reprimand.\n[86] During her testimony, Ms. Kaltush stated that as of January 2009, she has been avoiding the principal. She added that he is impolite with her, but she had no specific example to support her claim. The complainant stated that the principal's [Translation] attitude affects her a great deal. Again, she submitted no evidence to support this claim.\n[87] To her, the fact her position as vice principal was abolished and she was not offered employment for the following year was an act of retaliation. In fact, on June 12, 2009, after the first week of the hearing, the complainant received a letter from the school administration informing her that her employment would conclude on August 15, 2009, because the position of vice principal had been abolished. The complainant added that the principal allegedly told her she would no longer have a job the following year, but she added that she did not receive an official letter informing her of this decision. Although the Tribunal notes that the timing of the decision to abolish the position of vice principal may seem inappropriate, nothing supports the conclusion that the decision was made in retaliation against the filing of the complaint.\n[88] Marcel Rodrigue does not deny he wrote the June 12 letter. According to him, every employee who indicated they were not returning and those whose contracts were ending received a letter in June indicating that their employment would conclude at the end of August. Since the position of vice principal had been abolished, Mr. Rodrigue advised Ms. Kaltush of the situation, adding that she could have a teaching position the following year. The complainant allegedly first replied that she would not accept [Translation] a position with students, and then later changed her mind. Marcel Rodrigue then said he would send her name to the new principal.\n[89] The situations the complainant described has more to do with interpersonal issues and communications with her immediate supervisor that with acts of retaliation. She testified that neither the principal nor the band council ever mentioned her complaint in discussions with her. Moreover, Ms. Kaltush added that she did not know whether the principal was aware she had filed a complaint, because he never talked about it.\n(iii) Sylvie Malec [90] The complainant Sylvie Malec's allegations of retaliation are essentially based on the fact the school's administration refused to allocate planning and preparation time for her Innu language classes. In her opinion, when teaching the Innu language, the teacher's duties should include allocated planning time. She added that Innu language teachers do not have a predetermined program as is the case for core courses such as French and English. Teachers of those courses have access to teaching material that does not exist for Aboriginal language teaching.\n[91] She said that for her, teaching Innu at all school levels is extra work. She added that she informed the principal, Marcel Rodrigue, who allegedly replied: [Translation] you take it, or you don't take it and leave.\n[92] Although I can sympathize with Ms. Malec's situation, it is impossible for me to find, based on the evidence submitted, that this conflict between the administration and the complainant can be interpreted as retaliation because the complaint was filed.\n[93] Moreover, according to the testimony, the school's administration never referred to her complaint during their discussions.\nC. Conclusion Regarding the Allegations of Retaliation [94] The Tribunal finds that the complainants, \u00c9velyne Malec, Estelle Kaltush and Sylvie Malec did not establish prima facie evidence of retaliation.\n[95] The Tribunal feels that the situations described and the evidence submitted by the complainants do not support the allegations that the respondent retaliated against them following the filing of the complaint, contrary to section 14.1 of the Act. The Tribunal notes that the complainants did not seem to take the behaviour or decisions made by the respondent and its representatives in context, and they perceived them as retaliation. They describe, for example, disciplinary measures taken by the respondent starting in the fall of 2008 to support their allegations of retaliation. Although an employee in the complainants' situation might have been able to successfully challenge such measures in a legal or arbitral proceeding, the Tribunal notes that it is not a labour relations arbitrator.\n[96] Nothing in the evidence leads to the conclusion that the respondent imposed disciplinary measures or took other action because the complaint was filed, or that they were motivated by an intention to take retaliation.\n[97] It is clear that for many years, relations between the complainants and the Uauitshitun School administration were strained and tense. It is also clear that these problems became more complicated during the respondent's third party management and the ensuing obligation it had to get its finances in order, particularly in the education sector. The Tribunal recognizes that it is possible that conflicts between the complainants and the school's administration might have led the complainants to perceive certain acts the administration carried out under the exercise of its management rights as acts of retaliation, but they were not legally considered as such.\n[98] As a result, the allegations that the respondent had retaliated against the complainants contrary to section 14.1 of the Act are dismissed.\nIII. Section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act [99] At the time the complaint was filed, April 21, 2007, section 67 of the Act, which was repealed in 2008, (see Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act R.S.C. 2008, c. 30) was still in force. Section 67 stated:\n67. Nothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\n67. La pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\n[100] The wording in this provision is clear and concise. Parliament's purpose in adopting it was to prevent provisions of the Act from conflicting with the application of the Indian Act (see: Prince v. Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (1994, 25 C.H.R.T. D\/386, (F.C.), at paras. 23-24). This section should not, however, be taken as exempting all band council decisions, but only those authorized by the Indian Act. (See Ennis v. Tobique First Nation, 2006 CHRT 21, at para.18).\n[101] In Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Gordon Band Council, [2001] 1 F.C. 124 (C.A.), the Court found that section 67 of the Act must be interpreted restrictively because it limits the scope of human rights legislation. On this, the Court relied on Zurich Insurance Company v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [1992] 2 S.C.R. 321, page 339, in which the Supreme Court of Canada granted the Ontario Human Rights Code quasi-constitutional status, meaning that exceptions to such legislation must be interpreted restrictively.\n[102] In light of section 67, counsel for the respondent asked the Tribunal to declare that the Act has no effect on the human resources policy adopted by the respondent for Uauitshitun School and that the complaint must therefore be dismissed.\n[103] Many decisions have interpreted section 67 of the Act. In order to understand the scope of this provision, we shall conduct a brief overview of the principles of this case law. In Desjarlais v. Piapot Band No. 7, [1989] 3 F.C. 605, at page 608 the Federal Court Appeal Division interpreted the expression or any provisions made under or pursuant to that Act from section 67. In that case, the band council had adopted a motion to dismiss an employee. That employee then filed a complaint alleging that she was subject to discrimination on a prohibited ground based on age. The respondent alleged that the Commission did not have the jurisdiction to hear the case pursuant to section 67 (then subsection 63(2)) of the Act. In interpreting this provision, Desjardins J.A. stated:\n11. The word affects is indeed very wide in scope. I take it to have the meaning of To act upon or have an effect upon The word effet in the French version is also general and is equivalent to such words as cons\u00e9quence or influence. Hence: La pr\u00e9sente loi est sans cons\u00e9quence, sans influence sur.\n12. The word provision in the expression any provision of the Indian Act has a legislative connotation and refers both to the Indian Act and the Regulations adopted thereunder. This interpretation is confirmed by the French version.\n13. The word provision in the expression or any provision made under or pursuant to [the Indian Act] cannot have the same meaning as the first word provision and cannot refer exclusively to a legislative enactment of general application as counsel for the Commission submits. Such interpretation is made impossible by the French version. The word dispositions in that version might have the meaning of mesures l\u00e9gislatives but it encompasses as well the very wide connotation of d\u00e9cisions, mesures. So that the words or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act mean more than a mere stipulation of a legal character. I interpret such words as covering any [page 609] decision made under or pursuant to the Indian Act.\n[104] In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal questioned the way in which Indian bands could make legal decisions. Desjardins J.A. felt that however the decision was made, any decision a band council makes pursuant to a specific provision of the Indian Act would be made under or pursuant to the Indian Act and only in that case would the Act be without effect.\n[105] Application of section 67 to decisions made by a band council was discussed by Rothstein J. (as was then his title) in Shubenacadie Indian Band v. Canadian Human Rights Commission [1998] 2 F.C. 198 ; affirmed in [2000] F.C.J. No. 702. In that case, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal found that the chief and band council had discriminated against the complainants based on race and marital status by denying social assistance benefits to non-native spouses of Indian band members. At paragraph 31, the Federal Court stated:\nI do not think that the decision in this case is one contemplated by section 67 of the Canadian Human Rights Act. While there is no doubt that a decision was made by the Band Council, and it may well have been made under the Indian Band Council Procedure Regulations, there is no evidence to suggest that the decision was made pursuant to a provision of the Indian Act. While undoubtedly section 67 recognizes that certain provisions of the Indian Act and Regulations may conflict with the Canadian Human Rights Act and in such cases the Indian Act and Regulations will prevail, I do not think section 67 is to be interpreted as taking out of the scope of the Canadian Human Rights Act all decisions of Indian band councils provided they are made under the Indian Band Council Procedure Regulations. If it was Parliament's intention to immunize all decisions of Indian band councils from overview by the Human Rights Commission, Parliament would have expressly so provided rather than enacting section 67. Section 67 immunizes decisions authorized by the Indian Act and Regulations, but not all decisions made by Indian band councils. I think that this conclusion is consistent with the dicta in Desjarlais (Re). Section 67 therefore does not assist the applicant in this case.\n[106] The decision in Shubenacadie Indian Band was followed by the Tribunal in Bernard v. Waycobah Board of Education (1999), 36 C.H.R.T. D\/51, in which the Tribunal dismissed a section 67 argument stating that, although subsection 114(2) of the Indian Act authorizes the Minister to establish, operate and maintain schools for Indian children, it is difficult to establish a clear link between this provision of the Indian Act and the Waycobah Board of Education decision to terminate the complainant's employment as the school secretary. The Tribunal did not find that the decision was made pursuant to the Indian Act.\n[107] In Bressette v. Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation Band Council (No. 1), 2003 CHRT 41, at issue was a status Indian and member of the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation who applied, unsuccessfully, for the position of family case worker. He filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, alleging he did not receive the position because of his family status. The respondent claimed its decision was specifically authorized by sections 69, 81 and 83 of the Indian Act. Sections 81 and 83 authorize band councils to make by-laws for the purposes mentioned in those sections. The respondent also relied on two by-laws adopted pursuant to the Indian Act. The Tribunal concluded that the respondent's decision had both a staffing and a financial aspect; however, the main purpose of the band council's decision was to replace the family case worker position. The Indian Act has no specific provision on staffing in a band. As a result, the Tribunal found that section 67 did not apply.\n[108] Among the cases dealing with the application of section 67 cited by the respondent, three (Courtois v. Canada (Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, 1990 CanLII 702 (C.H.R.T.); Prince v. Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, supra, and Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Gordon Band Council, supra) concluded that the band council decision was exempt from human rights review. In those cases, the band council decision was supported by a specific provision in the Indian Act. In the other cases where the decision was subject to review under the Act, the respondent could not provide a specific provision in the Indian Act to support the decision about which the complaint was made.\n[109] In the present case, we must question whether there is a specific provision in the Indian Act that would allow the respondent to refuse payment of the isolated post allowance to the complainants. In his arguments, counsel for the respondent referred to section 73 of the Indian Act, under which Parliament delegated part of its constitutional law-making authority over Indians and lands reserved for Indians to the federal Cabinet through federal regulations. He also referred to sections 81, 83 and 85.1 that cover the making of by-laws. He added that the exercise of powers conferred on a band or council shall be exercised pursuant to the principle of delegations of powers, which is specifically mentioned at paragraph 2(3)(b) of the Indian Act.\n[110] Nobody in this case, including the complainants, challenged the respondent's power to make by-laws or policies regarding human resources at its school. What is challenged is the implementation of this policy, in particular the fact that the isolated post allowance was paid to all teachers except the Innu teachers. No provision in the Indian Act was submitted to the Tribunal in support of the conclusion that these benefits could not be granted to the Innu. As a result, it cannot be claimed that the respondent's decision to not grant this allowance to the complainants was a power resulting from the Indian Act.\n[111] The respondent also draws the Tribunal's attention to the transitional provision in section 3 of the Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, S.C. 2008, c. 30, which states:\n3. Despite section 1, an act or omission by any First Nation government, including a band council, tribal council or governing authority operating or administering programs or services under the Indian Act, that was made in the exercise of powers or the performance of duties and functions conferred or imposed by or under the Act shall not constitute the basis for a complaint under Part III of the Canadian Human Rights Act if it occurs within 36 months after the day on which this Act receives royal assent.\n3. Malgr\u00e9 l\u0092article 1, les actes ou omissions du gouvernement d\u0092une premi\u00e8re nation \u0096 y compris un conseil de bande, un conseil tribal ou une autorit\u00e9 gouvernementale qui offre ou administre des programmes ou des services sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens \u0096 qui sont accomplis dans l\u0092exercice des attributions pr\u00e9vues par cette loi ou sons son r\u00e9gime ne peuvent servir de fondement; a une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la Partie III de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne s\u0092ils sont accomplis dans les trente-six mois suivant la date de sanction de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[112] The respondent claims that this provision provides further clarification on the interpretive scope that section 67 of the Act should have had. He claims that this provision establishes the scope of the protection provided to the band council under the former provision and that [Translation] any prior court decision must now be clearly distinguished because of the broad scope this new provision gives to the former section 67.\n[113] The Tribunal does not accept this submission. The only effect of section 3 is to provide a grace period of 36 months, and any attempt to see this as a rejection of decisions involving the application of section 67 to date is illogical. If that had been Parliament's intent, it would have been expressed more clearly and not merely in a provision offering a grace period.\n[114] As a result, the respondent's objection regarding the issue of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is dismissed.\nIV. Remedies [115] The remedies sought by the complainants are:\npayment of the isolated post allowance; compensation for pain and suffering in accordance with paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act; and special compensation in accordance with subsection 53(3) of the Act.\nA. The Isolated Post Allowance [116] Subsection 53(2) of the Act states:\n53(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n53(2) \u00c0 l\u0092issue de l\u0092instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u0092article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u0092un acte discriminatoire :\n[ ]\nb) d\u0092accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u0092acte l\u0092a priv\u00e9e;\n[117] Given the Tribunal's findings, for the years prior to 2007, the complainants would therefore have the right to the isolated post allowances that they were denied as a result of the respondent's discriminatory practice.\n[118] The respondent's policy in force before 2007 provided that teachers with at least a bachelor's degree and professional employees with the same education had the right to an isolated post allowance. The rate of the allowance varied based on whether the teacher had dependent children ($6,000), or was considered not to have dependent children ($3,000). It also provided that if two employees were married or were common-law spouses, only one of the two could claim the isolated post allowance for an employee with dependent children and the other employee would receive the allowance for those with no dependent.\n[119] To determine the amount of the allowance to which the complainants are entitled, each case must be addressed independently:\n\u00c9velyne Malec \u0096 This complainant has a bachelor's degree in education. She has two dependent children. However, since her spouse received an allowance of $6,000 a year until 2007, she would only be entitled to an annual allowance of $3,000 from the start of her employment until 2007. The evidence also shows that the allowance she would have received from the respondent for the 2003-2004 year should be subtracted from this amount because she did not work at Uauitshitun School that year. Anne Bellefleur-Tettaut \u0096 She does not have a bachelor's degree but according to the evidence, has a teacher's certificate and a teaching permit. Ms. Bellefleur-Tettaut taught Innu at the school from 1983 to 2007. She testified that there are no universities that offer a bachelor's degree in Aboriginal language teaching. This evidence was not challenged. Although technically it could be argued that she does not meet the first criterion of the policy to receive the allowance, the Tribunal considers she had the equivalent experience and qualifications as a teacher with a bachelor's degree. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that she should be entitled to the isolated post allowance for the period of the 1990s (date when the school came under the respondent's jurisdiction) to 2007, when she retired, except for 2003-2004, when she did not work. The complainant has three children who are all adults today; the oldest is 33 and the youngest 25. When she began working for the respondent in 1990, the three children were minors, the youngest being 6. The Tribunal can therefore deduce that for 12 of the 17 years during which she was subject to the policy, she had dependent children. For those 12 years, she was entitled to the annual isolated post allowance of $6,000. For the five other years, she is entitled to $3,000 per year. Estelle Kaltush \u0096 She has a bachelor's degree in education. Since 1990, except for four years, she has been teaching at Uauitshitun School. She has two children, a 30\u2011year-old daughter and another who just finished CEGEP. Ms. Kaltush is entitled to the isolated post allowance of $6,000 for the period of 1990 to 2007, when she had dependent children. The respondent could, however, deduct four years from the amount because, according to the evidence, Ms. Kaltush did not work during those years, when she says she took a sabbatical. Anna Malec - She has a bachelor's degree and has worked for the respondent since 1990. According to the evidence, she had dependent children during the entire period in question and is therefore entitled to $6,000 per year for 1990\u20112007, except for the 2003-2004 year. Marceline Kaltush \u0096 She has a bachelor's degree and has worked at the school since 1990. Although she does not have any children, she says she is responsible for her nephew and niece. The boy is currently 19 and the girl 17. She has been responsible for her nephew since he was 4. The girl came to live with her in 2001. This evidence was not challenged. Since she has dependent children, she is entitled to the $6,000 annual allowance for the teaching years from 1994 to 2007, except for 2003-2004. Sylvie Malec \u0096 She has been teaching at Uauitshitun School since January 2003, except for the 2003-2004 year. She does not have a bachelor's degree, but for the same reasons as Anne Bellefleur-Tettaut, the Tribunal considers she is entitled to the isolated post allowance. Ms. Malec has dependent children and is therefore entitled to the $6,000 annual allowance for her teaching years until 2007. Monique Ishpatao \u0096 She has a bachelor's degree. She has been teaching at the school since 1990. She does not have any dependent children and therefore is entitled to the allowance of $3,000 a year, from 1990 to 2007, except for the 2003\u20112004 year.\n[120] Pursuant to paragraph 53(2)(b) of the Act, the complainants, except for Germaine Mest\u00e9nap\u00e9ao for whom no evidence was presented, are therefore entitled to the allowances described in the preceding paragraphs as a result of the respondent's discriminatory practice.\nB. Compensation For Pain And Suffering - Paragraph 53(2)(E) of the Act [121] The complainants are asking for compensation for pain and suffering experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice in accordance with paragraph 53(2)(e) of the Act. I do not feel that significant compensation is appropriate in this case. The complainants testified that the respondent's decision had affected their self-esteem. In my opinion, the evidence shows that it had only a minor effect on them. In the circumstances, it is justifiable to order the payment of compensation for pain and suffering in the amount of $500 to each complainant except Germaine Mest\u00e9nap\u00e9ao.\nC. Special Compensation - Subsection 53(3) [122] Under subsection 53(3) of the Act, the Tribunal may order the payment of special compensation to the victim if the respondent committed acts wilfully or recklessly. Did the respondent act recklessly? In other words, was it aware of the risk that its discriminatory practice might be perceived as wilful or reckless but proceeded nonetheless? In my opinion, the evidence does not support this submission. The respondent's decision to treat the complainants differently than the other teachers was perhaps not wise, but it was not, in my opinion, reckless within the meaning of subsection 53(3).\n[123] The complainants' request for special compensation pursuant to subsection 53(3) of the Act is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario January 27, 2010\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1318\/4808\nStyle of Cause:\nEvelyne Malec, Sylvie Malec, Marcelline Kaltush, Monique Ishpatao, Anne B.

Retention of Jurisdiction.\nI. Complaint [1] This complaint arose in April 23, 2004, and is brought pursuant to Sections 7 (b) and 10 (a) and (b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[2] The Complainant (Ms. Johnstone) alleges that the Respondent (CBSA) has engaged in a discriminatory practice on the ground of family status in a matter related to employment. The relevant prohibited ground of family status is enumerated in Section 3(1) of the Act.\n[3] Section 7 (b) of the Act reads:\nIt is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. [1976-77, c.33, s.7.]\n[4] Sections 10 (a) and (b) of the Act read:\nIt is a discriminatory practice of an employer, employee organization or employer organization\n(a) to establish or pursue a policy or practice, or\n(b) to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination. [R.S., 1985, c. H-6, s. 10; 1998, c. 9, s. 13(E)]\n[5] The practices complained of include failure to accommodate, and adverse differential treatment based on family status, which in this case means the raising of two young children. Pursuant to the findings in Moore v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 31, at para. 86 failure to accommodate is not a discriminatory practice under the Act, as there is no free-standing right to accommodation under the CHRA.\n[6] The alleged practice against the Complainant began in 2004. Although the Statements of Particulars of both parties deal primarily with the time period up to and including 2007, the complaint filed herein referred to the discrimination as being ongoing. Ms. Johnstone took the same position at the hearing that the discrimination complained of constituted a continuing event and is ongoing. The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) supported this approach.\n[7] The Respondent objected to the introduction of evidence being led pertaining to the time period after 2007 as constituting post complaint allegations, and that such evidence would be too remote in time in terms of relevancy. The complaint herein was filed April 23, 2004.\n[8] The Tribunal accepted the Complainant\u2019s and the CHRC\u2019s characterization of the complaint as ongoing, and noted that the written complaint made this assertion. The allegations raised under Section 10 of the Act also speak to the conduct complained of being systemic in nature, and remedies sought reflect this position.\n[9] Evidence was presented by all parties as to CBSA practices, CBSA written and unwritten policies, a relevant collective agreement as amended over the full time period, the governing Variable Shift Scheduling Agreement (VSSA) in place at the time of the complaint and as later amended, and implications both past and present of the implementation of those practices, policies and agreements.\n[10] Ms. Johnstone alleges that the CBSA\u2019s policies forced her into part-time status upon her return to work after having each of two children, resulting in her being given fewer hours of work than she was willing and able to work, with an attendant loss of benefits that are available to full-time employees, including benefits under her collective agreement and pension entitlements under the Public Service Superannuation Act.\n[11] Both the Complainant and the CBSA were represented by legal counsel at the hearing. CHRC was also represented by legal counsel, but addressed only the Section 10 arguments raised by the complaint. It was very beneficial to this Tribunal to have experienced senior legal counsel acting on behalf of all parties.\n[12] Previous to the hearing, the CBSA had sought to add the Union as a party. One of the main reasons given by CBSA to add the Union was that the VSSA prevented CBSA from considering Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request for static shifts, encompassing full-time hours over only 3 days per week. This argument was not advanced by CBSA at this hearing.\n[13] Ms. Johnstone and CHRC opposed the application on the grounds that none of the remedies sought by Ms. Johnstone required amendments to the governing collective agreement or to the VSSA. The Union provided an affidavit to the Tribunal taking a position of support of the Complainant, but did not actively participate. This motion was dismissed by the Tribunal on the basis that the Union\u2019s participation in the hearing was not necessary for the presentation of relevant evidence or the Tribunal\u2019s ability to adjudicate on the matters so raised. It was also dismissed because the application was made late in the process, and the Union\u2019s participation would not be necessary to properly dispose of the liability portion of the complaint [See 2009 CHRT 14].\nII. Factual Background [14] Ms. Johnstone is a Canada Border Services Officer (BSO). She has been in the employ of CBSA since April 14, 1998. She is presently on leave without pay, the particulars of which are detailed later in this Decision. At the time of this complaint she worked in Passenger Operations at the Pearson Airport Terminal (PIA) in Toronto, Canada.\n[15] By all accounts Ms. Johnstone is an exemplary employee, often exceeding her superiors\u2019 expectations and noted up for her diligence, excellent results, and acumen for her work duties.\n[16] Ms. Johnstone has been married to Jason Noble (Jason) since December 2002. Jason is also a BSO. During the early relevant time of this complaint, Jason worked for CBSA as a Supervisor also at the PIA. He now works in Ottawa.\n[17] Ms. Johnstone and her husband have two children. The eldest was born in January 2003, with Ms. Johnstone returning to work January 4, 2004. The second child was born in December 2004, with Ms. Johnstone returning to work December 26, 2005. Their two children will both be school age by 2010.\n[18] PIA is a 24 hours, 7 days per week operation. To cover the operational requirements necessitated by the workplace, the Collective Agreement is built around a rotating shift plan referred to as the vassa but spelled VSSA, an acronym for Variable Shift Schedule Agreement. From the time that Ms. Johnstone commenced working for CBSA, after a relatively short time as a part-time employee, she worked full-time on a schedule of 5 days on, 3 days off rotating shifts governed by the VSSA.\n[19] In addition to the rotation, the shifts are irregular and unpredictable. At the time of the events giving rise to this complaint, full-time employees rotated through 6 different start times over the course of days, afternoons, and evenings with no predictable pattern. Also, employees worked different days of the week throughout the duration of the schedule. This schedule was based on a 56 day pattern. BSOs were given 15 days\u2019 notice of each new shift schedule. The employer can change the schedule on 5 days\u2019 notice.\n[20] A full-time position within the context of this case, and as contemplated per Article 25.13 of the Collective Agreement in place at the time, was 37.5 regularly scheduled hours per week, based on an 8 hour day that included an unpaid \u00bd hour meal break. Any employee who worked less than 37.5 hours per week was considered part-time. Any employee who worked greater than 37.5 hours per week was paid overtime.\n[21] Overtime hours are required as a BSO. The requirement for overtime is often unpredictable, as it may arise due to job duties at any given time in particular circumstances that cannot be foreseen, e.g. the detention of goods or persons. Sometimes employees know ahead of time, or are called in by management to work on an overtime basis due to workplace demands as they arise.\n[22] Jason also worked regularly scheduled full-time hours on rotating shifts governed by the VSSA, and he worked an additional 10:00 am shift. Due to his supervisory duties, he was also required, from time to time, to attend meetings and training sessions on his days off and travel to other ports during job actions.\n[23] In 2002 to 2004, both before Ms. Johnstone went on her first maternity leave, and as she was returning from it, she sought accommodation from CBSA due to her new child-rearing responsibilities. She sought the same accommodation upon her return to work from her second maternity leave. Both times she was faced with an unwritten policy of CBSA that will not provide full-time hours to those requesting accommodation on the basis of child-rearing responsibilities.\n[24] Prior to returning from her first maternity leave, Ms. Johnstone asked CBSA for full-time static shifts. Ms. Johnstone wanted to work 3 days per week, 13 hour days, so that she could remain full-time. A 13 hour shift would include one \u00bd hour unpaid meal break. She did not specify a preferred start time. When she was advised by CBSA that this was not possible, she then made an alternate request of 3 days per week, 12 hour days. Although she recognized that this second position was part-time, she was trying to maximize the hours she would work in order to have as little negative effect on her pension and benefits as possible.\n[25] Ms. Johnstone testified that the reason she asked to work over a 3 day period, is that these were the 3 days per week during which she could arrange alternate child care. She had three family members who were willing to care for her child, and later children, one of the three days each. She had no family assistance for a fourth day.\n[26] Ms. Johnstone also testified that she tried to arrange third party childcare but was unable to do so due to the scheduling difficulties of a rotating shift schedule. She had no greater success on a static shift schedule that was outside normal third party care hours, and that could be unpredictably extended due to overtime requirements.\n[27] Ms. Johnstone testified that the reason she wanted to continue to work full-time hours was so that her pension entitlements and her promotional opportunities and income would not be adversely affected.\n[28] CBSA was willing to accommodate Ms. Johnstone, but to the extent only of a static shift of 3 days per week up to a maximum of 10 hours per day, plus a further 4 hours on a fourth day.\n[29] Corollary to the above, Ms. Johnstone suggested methods to her employer that would allow her to continue to keep her pension at a full-time level while working part-time, but these suggestions were refused. This is discussed in more detail below.\n[30] There is no dispute that CBSA has an unwritten policy that anyone seeking accommodation in order to care for children may be accommodated by being given static shifts, but must also go to part-time hours to a maximum of 34 hours per week. This unwritten policy does not allow employees to have static shifts with full-time hours if the reason for the request is childcare responsibilities.\n[31] There is also no dispute that CBSA has and does accommodate employees for medical and religious reasons by giving them static shifts with full-time hours, from time to time, for varying lengths of time, and for some on a permanent basis. These requests are assessed on an individual needs basis, and in the case of medical accommodation CBSA requires medical substantiation of the request. There are also instances of employees having been accommodated because they have children with medical needs.\n[32] Further, there was no dispute that this unwritten policy is applied unevenly. There are CBSA employees working part-time at 36 hours per week, employees working full-time static shifts, and others who have been allowed - although part-time - to maintain the equivalent of full-time pension and benefit entitlements. Although two of CBSA\u2019s management witnesses stated that CBSA wanted to discourage these anomalies, both conceded that these exceptions do continue to exist.\nIII. Respondent\u2019s Operations [33] The mandate of the CBSA includes the screening and processing of travelers and goods entering into Canada at each of its airports and land borders on a 24 hours a day, 7 days a week basis.\n[34] The busiest of these airports is PIA. The Passenger Operations District, a component of the CBSA\u2019s operations in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) region, oversees these functions at PIA.\n[35] Until 1994, customs functions were the responsibility of Customs and Excise within the Department of National Revenue. In or around 1994\/1995, the federal government decided to combine customs and excise into a single department, called the Department of National Revenue. In November 1999, these functions of the former department were transferred to a newly created agency called the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA).\n[36] On December 12, 2003, by federal Order-In-Council, the CCRA\u2019s customs responsibilities were transferred to a new Crown agency called the Canada Border Services Agency. This agency also assumed the ports of entry component (Immigration Inland Enforcement) previously performed by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. Additionally, the CBSA also took responsibility for the regulation of the entry of food, plants and animals, inspections previously performed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n[37] This date of December 12, 2003, when CBSA was created (and took over the responsibilities relevant to this complaint) became significant as the evidence unfolded in terms of its relation to the exhibited comprehensive Employment Equity Compliance Review of CCRA delivered by the CHRC on December 10, 2003. This is dealt with in more detail below.\n[38] Until the creation of the CCRA in 1999, the Complainant\u2019s employer was the Treasury Board Secretariat (TBS). Under its constituent legislation, the CCRA, and now the CRA, is a separate employer. Upon the transfer of customs functions from the CCRA to CBSA on December 12, 2003, TBS once again became the Complainant\u2019s employer.\n[39] Passenger Operations is currently one of the three main operational districts within the GTA region of the CBSA. The other two are Commercial Operations and GTEC. GTEC does not employ BSOs. In addition to these districts, the GTA region has a number of other divisions including the Investigations Division, the Intelligence Division, the Compliance and Verification Division, the Planning and Program Integration Division, and the Corporate Services Division (Human Resources, IT, Finance and Administration).\n[40] Of these, only Passenger Operations and Commercial Operations employ individuals at the group and level at which the Customs Inspectors (CIs) (PM-02s), later called BSOs (PM-03s) were classified in 2004 and thereafter. The International Mail Processing Centre (Gateway) is now included within Commercial Operations.\n[41] Commercial Operations was responsible for processing cargo from commercial aircraft and sufferance warehouses [facilities established for the landing, storage, safekeeping, transfer, examination, delivery and forwarding of imported goods before they are released by the CBSA], outports, a marine component and a railhead with locations in Concord and Brampton. The bulk of the work of this district is done at the PIA on the other side of the airfield from the terminals. BSOs in Commercial Operations performed counter duties for the public and examination of freight at warehouses with a view to determining whether to seize, hold or release goods.\n[42] In 2004, Gateway was a separate district within the GTA region. In or around 2005\/2006 these operations were merged into the Commercial Operations district. The work of the BSOs at Gateway is to sort and examine mail, documents and parcels coming to Canada through a primary processing area belt and then through secondary examination. Documentation is prepared on larger shipments that are held until duties are paid. Workers at Gateway work static shifts.\n[43] The BSO work performed at Gateway, Passenger Operations, and Commercial Operations is set out in one universal job description and all are classified similarly.\n[44] In 2004, Passenger Operations at PIA was responsible for processing passengers in three terminals (Terminals 1, 2 and 3). Passenger Operations also had responsibility at the East Hold, a building on the air field where small aircraft cross-border flights arrive. In 2004, passengers on these flights were met and taken by bus into Terminal 2 for processing. Fixed base operators (private jets) arriving with passengers were also processed through Passenger Operations, a function that moved to Commercial Operations in 2005.\n[45] In January 2007, Terminal 2 was closed down, and the CBSA operations within that terminal were absorbed within Terminal 1. Currently, Air Canada\u2019s U.S. and international flights operate through Terminal 1, and most other airlines operate through Terminal 3.\n[46] Mr. Norm Sheridan has been the District Director of Passenger Operations since 1999, and at all times relevant to this complaint. He first joined Revenue Canada\u2013Customs & Excise in 1979 where he had a variety of roles and responsibilities including, for a time, Human Resources.\n[47] In 2004, Mr. Sheridan had three Chiefs (one assigned to each Terminal) reporting to him. The three Chiefs included Rhonda Raby who testified at this inquiry, and held the position of Chief of Terminal 1.\n[48] Each Chief had between nine to thirteen Superintendants reporting to them who were responsible for the day to day management in their Terminals and supervising the BSOs on their crews.\n[49] BSOs each were assigned to crews within which they worked at the Primary Inspection Line (Primary), or Secondary counter (Secondary) processing passengers for entry into Canada. In 2004, each crew had approximately 8 employees. Management tried to balance gender and experience on the crews, as well as ensure language capability.\n[50] Also in 2004, each of the 3 Chiefs was assisted in their management and coordination functions by one or two Operations Coordinators. These Operations Coordinators worked afternoons, weekends and statutory holidays.\n[51] Effective February 12, 2007 the management structure was changed. There are now 10 Chiefs within Passenger Operations: 3 per each of the two Terminals; one Chief of Enforcement; one Chief of Corporate Services; one Chief of the Redevelopment Program; and one Chief responsible for Immigration Policy.\n[52] The Superintendents in the Terminals continue in the same general job description. In the corporate area, they prepare shift schedules, manage the performance appraisal system, and monitor the program. There are currently two Superintendents who specifically manage any accommodation requests by employees asking to be relieved, for whatever reason, from the VSSA schedule.\nIV. Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT)\/CHRC History [53] There is a long history involving the CBSA (and its predecessors), and the CHRC, the CHRT and the Federal Court on the issue of the definition of family status discrimination as it relates to employment, and on the implementation of decisions previously taken. As this history arose repeatedly during the hearing, and many exhibits were tendered attesting to it, identifying some of this history at the outset is helpful as a framework to the present complaint.\n1984 - 1993\n[54] February 17, 1993: The decision of Brown v. National Revenue (Customs & Excise), 1993 CanLII 683 (CHRT) (Brown) dealt with the issue of discrimination based on sex (pregnancy) and family status contrary to the Act. The Respondent was the CBSA\u2019s predecessor, the National Revenue Agency \u2013 Customs and Excise. As in this case, the Respondent took the position that the Complainant had been accommodated to a sufficient degree to the point of undue hardship, and that she had not made adequate efforts to obtain day care, the onus for which was hers alone. Although the decision was rendered in 1993, it was based on allegations that arose in 1984 and 1985. The inquiry into the complaint, which was found to be substantiated, required consideration of the nature of family status as a prohibited ground of discrimination within the Act.\n[55] At page 15 of the Brown decision (supra), the Tribunal set forth the requirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on the ground of family status as follows:\n\u2026the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a Parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer.\n[56] At page 20 of the Brown decision, the Tribunal found that parents are under an obligation to seek accommodation from their employer so that they can best serve their obligations to the employer and their duties and obligations within the family. The Tribunal went on to state:\nIt is this Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the purposive interpretation to be affixed to s.2 of the CHRA is a clear recognition within the context of family status of a parent\u2019s rights and duty to strike a balance coupled with a clear duty on the part of any employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance within the criteria set out in the Alberta Dairy Pool case. To consider any lesser approach to the problems facing the modern family within the employment environment is to render meaningless the concept of family status as a ground of discrimination.\n[57] Ms. Brown was also a BSO (then called a Customs Inspector) who asked to work a day shift and if necessary to accomplish this a transfer, after her child was born to accommodate childcare needs as both she and her husband worked shifts. The Respondent employer did not accede to her request, as it did not recognize childcare needs for an employee working shifts as an accommodation obligation under the Act. Having found the Respondent\u2019s failure to accommodate Ms. Brown\u2019s request for day shift work discriminatory, the Tribunal directed the Respondent to write a letter of apology to Ms. Brown and ordered the Respondent to prevent similar events from recurring through recognition and policies that would acknowledge family status to be interpreted as involving a parent\u2019s rights and duty to strike a balance [between work obligations and child rearing] coupled with a clear duty on the part of any employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance as noted in paragraph 54 above.\n[58] Following this decision, a 1993 letter of apology to Ms. Brown was written by M. E. Hynna, Assistant Deputy Minister, Customs Operations Branch, two undated drafts of which were exhibited in this hearing with cover letters dated in July and August, 1993. The letter included the following:\nBased on the findings of the Tribunal that there was discrimination by regional management against you on both grounds outlined in your complaint dated July 17, 1985 and, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s ruling, I would like to apologize on behalf of the Department for failing to accommodate you during and after your pregnancy. It is regrettable that the circumstances arising from your situation were not facilitated by management at the outset. However, in order to avoid any future misunderstanding, I would like to reassure you that a departmental policy is being developed in order to ensure that similar practices do not occur in the future. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to management in The Toronto Regional Office as well as to your immediate supervisors for the purposes of remind them of their obligations under the Act.\n[59] Presumably these last two paragraphs were a reference, at least in part, to the wording in Brown used at enumerated remedy 4 at page 15: In order to ensure similar discriminatory practices do not occur in the future, we direct pursuant to s. 53 (2) (a) that the Respondent submit proof sufficient for the CHRC that there exists an appropriate policy of accommodation for employee transfer.\n[60] Of note, Mr. Norm Sheridan, currently Director of Passenger Operations for CBSA at PIA, is mentioned in Brown at page 9 as having re-written an evaluation of Ms. Brown who had been described by her then superintendent in 1987 as abnormal without further explanation. Mr. Sheridan testified that in or about this time, he was Director of Programs for 3 years in the Greater Toronto Regional Office, and from 1989 forward he held the positions of Chief of Operations at PIA for Terminal 2 and then Chief of Operations at PIA for Terminal 2 for one year, followed by various positions in the Regional office again such as Manager of Operational Services, Chief of Operational Services, Director of Human Resources, and Chief in Drawbacks, Refunds and Remissions. It is apparent from these senior positions in operations and human resources that Mr. Sheridan was personally familiar with the Brown decision.\n1993 - 1995\n[61] 1993: A further exhibited letter dated July 19, 1993 and referencing the Brown decision was written by Dianne Dioguardi, Staff Relations Officer, Operations Section, Staff relations and Compensation Division, Human Resources Branch, Revenue Canada Customs & Excise Revenue Canada. It was written to Mr. Robert J. Venier, Counsel for the Respondent, Civil Litigation, Toronto Regional Office, also with Revenue Canada It stated:\n\u2026[with] the impending integration of the two divisions of Revenue Canada \u2013 Taxation and Customs and Excise, all policies will have to be amalgamated and tabled at separate Executive Committee meetings. Consequently, it could be quite some time before this particular policy is approved.\n[62] Counsel for the CHRC, Rosemary G. Morgan, indicated that she intended to file the decision with the Federal Court and proceed with enforcement. A letter from John Viassi Nagy, Civil Litigation counsel, dated March 18, 1994 was also exhibited, addressed to William F. Pentney of CHRC enclosing a draft policy to address the Brown decision. A judicial review of the Brown decision was initiated by the Respondent, and later mutually adjourned in 1995 in order to allow for a settlement of outstanding issues.\n1998 \u2013 1999\n[63] The Federal Court initiated a Status Review of the implementation of the Brown decision in November 1998, which ultimately led to the dismissal of the judicial review application. An exhibited Treasury Board Secretariat letter dated October 5, 1999 to CHRC speaks to working in consultation with the CHRC to implement Brown, and giving the history of the matter. The letter noted that other implementation matters had been settled, but not the part of the Order calling for the Respondent to develop a policy of accommodation reflecting the decision.\n2000\n[64] The CCRA Labour Relations Division organized and hosted an Employment Equity Strategic Session on December 8, 2000. As part of the agenda, the participants considered an exhibited document drafted by this Division\u2019s personnel entitled Draft \u2013 Introduction to the Strategic Direction of Employment Equity for the CCRA that bore a date mark of 2000-11-02. Revealing that there was at that time an internal recognition of the disproportionate burden on women workers for childcare and related family responsibilities, at pages 5 and 6 of this document the following was stated:\nWomen balancing work and family life is an issue that affects many women working in the federal public service and within the CCRA. Generally women still continue to play a greater role in bearing the responsibility for childcare, eldercare and home maintenance. This issue can be compounded by a corporate culture that does not recognize this, [Tribunal\u2019s emphasis], which in turn can have adverse affects on the distribution of women within the organization. In a study produced by the Conference Board of Canada, when asked what the impact of work-life conflicts was, 32% of respondents (54% female 46% male) indicated they have turned down or chosen not to apply for a promotion. Fourteen percent have left a job because of the work-life conflict while 24% have turned down or chose not to apply for a transfer because of it. Women have been traditionally marginalized in the labour market\u2026This trend is also seen in the CCRA where women dominate the Clerical Group with representation rates above 80% a full 10% above the Labour Market Availability. Under-representation for women in CCRA occurs in the Professional Group and the Program Administration and Senior Clerical Group \u2026 Surprisingly, women are graduating from university programs at a rate of 58% in comparison to men. This ratio is consistent in the social science area and in the arts and science areas women are graduating at a rate of 67% in comparison to men. The bulk of employees in the CCRA are with the Program Administration and Senior Clerical Group. This group is where the majority of our custom inspectors and revenue officers in the program administration (PM) group are coded.\n2001- 2003\n[65] November 8, 2001: On this date the CCRA was formally notified of an upcoming audit by the CHRC, pursuant to the Employment Equity Act. The process commenced in January 2002. There was a workforce analysis done in 2002 and a goals feedback exercise in 2002. On-site visits were conducted over several months in 2003 in BC, Ontario and Quebec. At the time, 58.4% of CCRA\u2019s workers were women.\n[66] A comprehensive Equity Compliance Review was completed and tendered by the CHRC to the CBSA\u2019s immediate predecessor on December 10, 2003.\n[67] At pages 15 and 16 of the Equity Compliance Review there was a section titled Women\u2019s Program wherein the following was stated:\nNevertheless, the Agency has proposed some strategies and goals to improve the work situation for women as follows:\n-increase representation of women in Administration & Senior Clerical using such initiatives as advertising on notices of job opportunities that employment equity may be used as a placement criterion; -accommodate women in balancing their work and personal life through supportive policies and management.\n[68] On December 12, 2003, as noted previously, the CBSA was created and took over the operations relevant to this complaint. In that the Compliance Review was tabled two days previous, the whole of the evidence is clear that its recommendations were not followed up on or implemented.\n[69] Witnesses for both parties testified that to their knowledge, as senior managers and employees, there has never been full implementation of the orders in Brown that speak to creating policies of accommodation which demonstrate an acceptance of the family status obligations of an employer as defined by Brown.\n2004- 2007\n[70] 2004: After Ms. Johnstone filed her complaint on April 23, 2004, the CHRC Investigator appointed found that CBSA differentiated between classes of employees, permitting employees who sought relief from the rotating shift schedule for medical reasons to remain full-time, while requiring those who sought the same relief for reasons of childcare to work part-time. Part-time allocations of work, for childcare reasons are defined by the CBSA as meaning up to 34 hours per week. The Investigator also found that the Respondent\u2019s evidence of operational concerns was an impressionistic assumption and that the Respondent had failed to provide a justification for the policy in question. The CHRC Investigator recommended at that time that the complaint be referred to the CHRT.\n[71] December 2005: An exhibited internet website page, published by CBSA Human Resources, contained excerpts from a GTAR Newsletter. GTAR is an acronym that stands for Groupe de travail des associations de retrait\u00e9s des secteurs, public et parapublic. This newsletter excerpt touts a proposed CBSA mandatory Employment Equity Program, and the formation of local committees within CBSA to implement short and long-term plans based on an Employment Equity Plan filed in April 2005. The following statements appear in reference to both the Canadian Human Rights Act (referred to below as a Human rights Code), the Employment Equity Act, and employment equity generally:\nWe will, through planning, implementing positive measures, monitoring and reporting, be able to chart our progress in this area, and demonstrate compliance with a key piece of Canadian legislation.\u2026Many of us are balancing busy family lives with our work life; many of us have specific needs and wants from the organization. While organizational requirements always come first, we know that the Human Rights Code prohibits unreasonable discrimination on a number of grounds. For a complete list of prohibited grounds see the link below\u2026. In addition to programming under the Employment Equity Act, CBSA adheres to principles related to diversity. In CBSA Human Resources Division website a workplace that embraces diversity, each individual is recognized for his or her uniqueness\u2026.\n[72] January 2007: Notwithstanding the Investigator\u2019s recommendation that the complaint be referred to the CHRT (see paragraph 70 above), the CHRC dismissed the complaint. Ms. Johnstone therefore initiated judicial review proceedings in the Federal Court seeking to set aside the CHRC decision. The application was allowed by Justice Barnes (See: Johnstone v. Canada (A.G.), 2007 FC 36). An appeal by the Respondent to the Federal Court of Appeal was dismissed (See: 2008 FCA 101), and the case remitted back to the CHRC for reconsideration. The CHRC thereafter referred the complaint to the CHRT for inquiry and deliberation.\n[73] June 2007: The Respondent\u2019s position herein is that family status discrimination has not been established on a prima facie basis, and that if it has been, the discrimination is justifiable as a Bona Fide Occupational Requirement (BFOR) due to undue hardship. In the context of this position taken, it is worth noting that a draft CBSA Policy on Duty to Accommodate dated June 2007 was exhibited.\n[74] The Respondent objected to the inclusion of the Draft Policy to Accommodate arguing the document was highly prejudicial, it had never been implemented, and therefore should not form part of the record. On its face, the Draft Policy to Accommodate was prepared by the Employment Equity & Diversity Division, Human Resources Branch of the CBSA. Whether its provisions had been implemented or not, and the evidence clearly established that they had not, it was a document that the Complainant\u2019s witness, Mr. Star, testified to. Mr. Star testified that he had been given the document by the Head of the employee\u2019s Union who was in turn given it at a meeting with Respondent representatives. Mr. Star had taken the document to a meeting with management for the Respondent when he was a Union steward, and had referred to it in that meeting. Although Rhonda Raby denied any prior knowledge of it in that meeting and at the hearing, another management employee of the Respondent present at the meeting admitted to Mr. Star that he was familiar with the document. Mr. Star\u2019s evidence was uncontroverted.\n[75] The Draft Policy to Accommodate includes acknowledgement of the aims and objectives of federal Human Rights legislation and developed case law, as well as the responsibilities of the employee to inform the employer, request accommodation, and work with his\/her manager to develop the most appropriate accommodation for the circumstances.\n[76] The Draft Policy to Accommodate also outlines the responsibilities of the Union, the Human Resources Advisors, and the Manager\u2019s\/Supervisors, as including but not limited to:\nensuring all employees know their rights in regard to accommodation,\nconsulting on a confidential basis with the employees to determine the nature of the accommodation required,\nmeeting the employee\u2019s needs short of causing undue hardship,\ntaking an active role in exploring alternative approaches and solutions to accommodate the employee,\ngranting accommodation requests in a timely, reasonable manner,\nfollowing up proactively on requests for temporary or permanent accommodation\u2026,\ncreating and maintaining an inclusive environment that is accessible and enables employees to be open and honest, and\nensuring that all employees who choose to participate in all work-related events are able to do so and that they can take advantage of the opportunities offered (ex: team meetings, training etc.)\n[77] The Draft Policy to Accommodate also speaks to the National Employment Equity\/Diversity Section\u2019s Role, calls for the creation of a CBSA National Job Accommodation Fund to assist in accommodation costs, and details processes for seeking accommodation, responding to accommodation requests, and appealing accommodation decisions if necessary.\nV. Complainant\u2019s Case A. Evidence of Fiona Johnstone [78] Until Ms. Johnstone had children, she worked regular full-time rotating shifts under the VSSA as outlined above. However, when she became a mother and the primary parent responsible for childcare, she could no longer work the VSSA schedule and meet her legal and moral obligations to her children due to a lack of available childcare.\n[79] Ms. Johnstone testified that she was willing to engage third party childcare for her children. She quickly discovered, however, that the ordinary daycare hours of any registered facility were 7 am to 6 pm Monday through Friday.\n[80] Ms. Johnstone also discovered that even unlicensed daycares or private daycare providers will not provide childcare on an unpredictable and fluctuating basis, usually not at all on weekends, and certainly not overnight.\n[81] Ms. Johnstone then turned to her family members, and was able to get childcare coverage for unpredictable hours, including overnight, on three days per week. The Respondent disputed the Complainant\u2019s diligence in trying to arrange for third party childcare assistance, however, this Tribunal accepts Ms. Johnstone\u2019s evidence that this was the ultimate and best childcare arrangement she could make.\n[82] The evidence showed that Jason\u2019s shift requirements also as a BSO at PIA, albeit as a Supervisor, were in many ways more onerous than those of Ms. Johnstone. Their schedules typically overlapped 60% of the time, but were not coordinated in any manner. Jason could not provide the childcare Ms. Johnstone needed on a reliable basis either.\n[83] Ms. Johnstone testified that the alternative of a live-in nanny or childcare provider was not an option for her, due to the expense and the necessity that she and her family would have had to move into a home that could accommodate another adult person. As the expert evidence unfolded at the hearing, it is not a viable option for most Canadian families for the same reasons.\n[84] Although it was obvious that this Human Rights complaint process has been an emotional ordeal for Ms. Johnstone, it was clear from her evidence which was given in a forthright manner that she enjoys her work as a BSO and is proud of her accomplishments in the workplace.\n[85] Ms. Johnstone testified that she has made a long term commitment to her role as a BSO, and intended to make this her lifelong career. This is the reason that her initial most significant issue was her concern that she would lose pension and other benefits, with long term consequences detrimental to her future retirement and promotional opportunities.\n[86] Ms. Johnstone emphasized that she wanted to return to work putting in full-time hours, but needed to serve those hours over 3 days. She did not specify the starting times for those 3 days, nor did she insist on returning to the duties she had performed before. What was uppermost in her mind was working at least 37.5 hours per week, and maintaining her pension and benefits and opportunities for training and advancement.\n[87] Ms. Johnstone however ran up against an arbitrary unwritten policy of the CBSA applied to workers seeking accommodation on the basis of childcare responsibilities. Ms. Johnstone learned, from speaking with co-workers who had returned from maternity leaves, that if she requested static shifts outside the VSSA, the CBSA would only allow her to work part-time hours. She testified that she contacted a Terminal 2 Superintendent, Ms. Gerstl, in late 2003 asking to work full-time hours over 3 days. She stated that Ms. Gerstl e-mailed her back that this was against CBSA policy. Although CBSA questioned whether this exchange ever happened and Ms. Johnstone could not produce a copy of the e-mail, CBSA did not call Ms. Gerstl as a witness, advising she was on medical leave at the time of the hearing. This Tribunal accepts Ms. Johnstone\u2019s evidence that this e-mail exchange took place.\n[88] The position of CBSA is that workers seeking accommodation for childcare obligations are doing so due to choices they have made in life, for which the employer bears no responsibility. Hence, while the Respondent is prepared to make some adjustments to such a worker\u2019s schedule, it refers to these adjustments as arrangements as opposed to accommodations. This position was articulated on behalf of the Respondent by Mr. Norm Sheridan.\n[89] Ms. Johnstone was aware, from her own observations during her time of employment with CBSA that historically the Respondent has treated only those seeking medical accommodations as obligations to be met pursuant to human rights legislation. Such workers are assessed on an individual basis. Accommodations are made in their work schedules, in accordance with supporting medical information\/recommendations, and if it is compatible with their specific medical requirements they are given static shifts with full-time hours.\n[90] Ms. Johnstone learned later from speaking with Murray Star, then a Union executive member, that he had been accommodated for religious reasons but only after he had pursued a complaint so that he could observe the Sabbath and other sacred days of his Jewish faith. Mr. Star testified to this experience in his evidence at the hearing.\n[91] When her attempts to find childcare that would allow her to work the VSSA full-time failed, Ms. Johnstone pursued full-time hours despite her knowledge that in most cases it is denied. She did this in part because she also knew that there had been exceptions made to this unwritten policy, and that some workers who had returned from maternity leave had been given static shift daytime hour duties, and shifts of greater length than the regular 8 hours per day.\n[92] Ms Johnstone testified that she knew of at least two other co-workers, whom she named, that worked 9 hour shifts over 4 days per week for a total of 36 hours per week. She stated that both of them had told her this, and in any event their schedules are posted publicly. This was not challenged by CBSA. In other words, these workers were not limited by policy to 34 hours per week, nor to the regular 8 hour per day shift.\n[93] Ms. Johnstone also named another co-worker whom she knew to be working 11 hour shifts due to her childcare responsibilities at home. This was not challenged by CBSA.\n[94] Ms. Johnstone further named two other co-workers who had initially been assigned to full-time program support in day shifts due to their family responsibilities, and then had stayed on in those positions after the need for their accommodation had passed. This was not challenged by CBSA. These co-workers, therefore, were not limited by policy to only work part-time up to 34 hours per week.\n[95] Ms. Johnstone was encouraged to ask and pursue her desire to work full-time upon return by her then Union representative, Murray Star. However, once Superintendent Gerstl had told her it was not possible, through her husband she approached Rhonda Raby, then Chief of Terminal 1, to work 12 hour shifts over 3 days. This approach was made shortly before Ms. Johnstone was to return to work after her first maternity leave. Raby denied this request citing health and safety concerns.\n[96] Ms. Raby also made it clear that the maximum number of hours Ms. Johnstone could work per week in order to get static shifts would be 34.\n[97] As a result, Ms. Raby offered that Ms. Johnstone could work a maximum of 10 hour per day over 3 days per week, and a further 4 hour shift on a fourth day. Starting times might vary, but these shifts could be on the same days of the week, each week. Ms. Raby made no inquiries of Ms. Johnstone as to her efforts to find childcare, or the reasons behind her childcare provision difficulties, but simply applied the CBSA unwritten policy.\n[98] With respect to working the fourth day offered, this was not viable for Ms. Johnstone. As she could not work full-time in any event, she did not want to incur the cost of childcare for a shortened 4th day. She did not know if she could arrange a fourth day\u2019s coverage, but even if she could, the cost of getting to and from a daycare and to and from work added to the daycare costs themselves, negated the real benefit to her earning an extra 4 hours of wages.\n[99] After her first child was born, Ms. Johnstone was able to arrange childcare coverage on Fridays, Sundays and Mondays. As stated, she was prepared to work 13 hour shifts and overtime on those days. Because the Respondent would not consider this suggestion as relayed by Ms. Gerstl, and would not allow her to work 36 hours per week, she ultimately accepted the 10 hours only on each of the three days she had childcare through family members.\n[100] Ms. Johnstone testified that shortly after her return to work after her first maternity leave, she asked her employer if she could remain on full-time status and characterize those hours not worked as leave without pay. She was aware at the time that leave without pay was pensionable. The Respondent would not allow her to do this. She also inquired about topping- up the difference to enable her to keep the equivalent of full-time pension benefits, but the Respondent did not allow this either. The CBSA did not dispute this application of its unwritten policies.\n[101] Ms Johnstone further testified, and this Tribunal accepts, that if she had been allowed to work full-time hours over the three days she requested, that she would have found a way to handle her childcare responsibilities to be able to work those days, both after the birth of her first child and her second child. She did ask her employer, before her return from her second maternity leave, to allow her to work full-time hours over 3 days, but was again refused.\n[102] Ms. Johnstone testified that she therefore worked even less than 30 hours per week after the birth of her second child, because she had been forced to give up on the possibility of full-time static shifts, and had greater family responsibilities. Again, management for the Respondent made no inquiries of Ms. Johnstone as to her particular circumstances.\n[103] In addition to having her pension and benefits pro-rated, Ms. Johnstone testified that as a part-time employee she missed out on training opportunities, was not permitted to become an acting Superintendent, nor work on Special Teams. Overtime is also paid on a lesser basis to part-time employees when compared with those working full-time.\n[104] Ms. Johnstone knew and named workers who had returned from maternity leave and been given full-time static shifts at PIA. She also knew and named BSOs in other operations that work 13 hours shifts such as in Niagara Falls, ON and Estevan, SK. She did not know at the time that the Respondent could have transferred her to another part of their operations, such as Gateway, where static shifts were the norm. This information became known to her through the complaint process.\n[105] Ms. Johnstone was asked as to her knowledge of other BSO couples, i.e. where each partner works as a BSO at PIA. She testified that she knew of 20 such couples out of an approximate workforce of 275 workers. Of those 20 couples, most but not all have children. Of those who have children a small percentage have children under school age, and approximately 8 of the 20 have partners with rotating shift schedules as well. Her testimony in this regard was not challenged by CBSA.\n[106] At the time of the hearing, Ms. Johnstone was on unpaid Care & Nurturing Leave covered by the VSSA. Previously, she had been on a one year Relocation of Spouse Leave without pay because her husband was transferred to Ottawa as a trainer. There are relatively new provisions in place that all BSOs carry firearms, and Jason had the qualifications to provide this expanded training. She testified that she would have preferred to be working during both these periods, but as she could not work full-time hours in any event, she took these Leaves.\n[107] As both her children will be of school age in September 2010, Ms. Johnstone testified that she intends to return to full-time work at that time. There are provisions in the VSSA that cover situations where a spouse has to leave one city (Toronto) to live in another city (Ottawa) to be with her husband. This situation mandates that she be accommodated with a position in her new place of residence, being Ottawa.\n[108] With respect to the workplace generally, in response to questions put by CHRC counsel, Ms. Johnstone testified that neither the Respondent nor the Union had given her any information, written or orally, about the Respondent\u2019s accommodation policies or her human rights. She identified co-workers also working part-time who had been refused full-time status requested for reason of childcare responsibilities. She also identified co-workers who were working part-time by choice.\n[109] Under cross-examination, Ms. Johnstone was questioned extensively on the nature of her duties as a BSO in terms of the need for focus, sustained attention, maintaining vigilance, assessing risk, handling public aggression, etc. Presumably this was an attempt by Respondent\u2019s counsel to adduce evidence through this witness of health and safety concerns with longer shifts. Ms. Johnstone never indicated that she felt she could not handle the longer shifts she had requested.\nB. Evidence of Murray Star [110] Mr. Star has been employed with CBSA since 1990 as a BSO. From 1996 to 2000 he held the position of acting Supervisor for various interim periods, and he has been engaged in training of other BSOs over time.\n[111] In or about 1999 Mr. Star was a Union Steward, and from 2003 to 2008 was an Executive Steward representing Union members. At the time of the hearing he was no longer a Union Executive member.\n[112] Mr. Star testified that he had his own issues involving the Act (in approximately 2001) when his employment terms did not reflect his religious observances regarding the Sabbath and religious holidays. Being of the Jewish faith, he did not want to work from sundown on Fridays through Saturdays, or on the Jewish High Holidays for religious observance.\n[113] Initially, his Terminal Chief agreed that he should be accommodated and was willing to allow him to exchange shifts for one year. However, Mr. Norm Sheridan took the position that the entitlement to the observance of a Holy Day only related to one event per year, not a weekly ongoing observance. Mr. Star filed a complaint under the Act. Mr. Sheridan gave authority to each Terminal Chief to decide the issue based on operational requirements. The CHRC Investigator found in Mr. Star\u2019s favour and an agreement giving Mr. Star the accommodation he sought was reached between the parties with mediation.\n[114] Mr. Star has worked alongside Ms. Johnstone and described her work performance as excellent. He also assisted her with putting forward first her request for accommodation, and later her CHRA complaint when she was not given what she was asking for.\n[115] Mr. Star knew upon Ms. Johnstone\u2019s return from her first maternity leave that she wanted to work static full-time shifts. Shortly after her return in early January 2004, Ms. Johnstone confided to Mr. Star that she wanted to work full-time static shifts. He was aware that she approached management with her request but she was rebuffed. He recalled discussing Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request with Norm Sheridan on more than one occasion during the relevant 2004 to 2006 period. He testified that Mr. Sheridan stated to him that Ms. Johnstone would not be given the accommodation she was seeking because if CBSA gave this to her everybody would want it.\n[116] Mr. Star testified that he also specifically asked Mr. Sheridan for the operational reasons for his position verbally and in writing, but he never received a response.\n[117] Given his long term familiarity with Passenger Operations and the VSSA, and his experience on the Union executive and as an employee representative, Mr. Star stated that granting Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request would not have had any adverse effect on the CBSA financially or otherwise. He was also unaware of any negative operational effects resulting from the existing medical accommodations.\n[118] Mr. Star confirmed that the Union was open to, and supportive of, special requests for human rights reasons. Mr. Star stated that the Union executive was very supportive of any individual requests as they would never infringe on anyone\u2019s human rights.\n[119] Mr. Star confirmed that, unlike the VSSA in place in 2004, there are 12 hour shifts contemplated in the latest VSSA that came into effect in Fall 2008. It is a 5 days on, 4 days off schedule with multiple shifts starting at different times during the day over a 63 day period. There are approximately 12 shifts scheduled in the Customs and Immigration divisions of the workplace that operate from 5 am through to a midnight shift. He further testified that he could identify at least 5 or 6 workers that work 5 day static shifts.\n[120] Mr. Star also testified to personal knowledge of approximately 12 workers who have shift schedules that are specific to that individual for a variety of reasons. He named one co-worker who requested static midnight shifts (10 pm to 8 am) that management agreed to. He confirmed based on exhibits put to him, that there are a number of BSOs who are working static midnight shifts or the same 3, 4, or 5 days each week. For instance, Dedicated Coverage Teams (primarily new-hires) might work different hours but are primarily afternoons, and they are fixed for the days they work, typically the busiest periods of Thursday through Sunday. The most popular shift is the evening shift from Noon to 11 pm, or from 3 pm to 3 am, as the younger workers do not seem to prefer an early start.\n[121] Mr. Star was unaware throughout his time with CBSA of any co-worker complaints of preferential treatment when accommodation requests were met by management. Mr. Star had not observed any prejudicial impact on CBSA\u2019s PIA operations from medical accommodations, nor religious accommodations.\n[122] Mr. Star had personal knowledge that management had not stopped BSOs from transferring body for body, i.e. in equal numbers to maintain the same personnel complement, (for various reasons other than childcare responsibilities) from one part of the CBSA operations to another, e.g. from Passenger Operations to Gateway or vice versa. Mr. Star testified that the nature of the work at Gateway is less demanding and less varied than at Passenger Operations and there is no necessity for any re-training if a BSO goes from Passenger or Commercial Operations to Gateway. Mr. Star was aware of several BSOs who have transferred from Passenger Operations to Gateway.\n[123] Knowing that all pension and contractual benefits are pro-rated for those that self-reduce to part-time status, Mr. Star was aware of a BSO in Passenger Operations, whom he named, who reduced her hours after she returned from maternity leave but was allowed to put in her unworked hours as leave without pay, and thereby maintain her benefits by paying the full amount into her pension. This was denied to Ms. Johnstone.\n[124] Mr. Star was unaware of any official accommodation given by CBSA for family status reasons, and confirmed that there are no written policies requiring a worker who wants static shifts because of childcare obligations to move to part-time hours. It is local management\u2019s decisions that carry with respect to scheduling requests. In this case, local management means PIA management.\n[125] Mr. Star testified as to the exhibited Draft Policy to Accommodate dated June 2007. This 13 page document was given to him in 2007 by John King, a former Union Representative and later the Union President. Mr. King had advised him at the time that he picked it up at an Occupational Hearing, which is a meeting of senior Union officials and management held from time to time to discuss operational issues.\n[126] Mr. Star testified that he used the Draft Policy to Accommodate as part of his negotiations with management on behalf of an employee who was seeking medical accommodation. In the 2007 meeting when he produced it, Mr. Star testified that Ms. Raby claimed to have no knowledge of it whatsoever and that she questioned its authenticity.\n[127] After some time, Supervisor Darren Millet who was also present at the meeting, acknowledged that he had seen the Draft Policy to Accommodate before and that it had been circulated to management for management\u2019s opinion. Mr. Star was given the distinct impression by Mr. Millet that management was not keen on the Draft Policy to Accommodate. Mr. Star asked Mr. Millet if they (the employees) could be looking forward to its introduction, to which Mr. Millet did not respond. Mr. Star confirmed that there has been no implementation of the provisions of the Draft Policy to Accommodate.\n[128] Mr. Star testified that he felt the Draft Policy to Accommodate answers all the employees requests and that something like that document would be perfect. He offered through CBSA management in the past to work with management to develop a policy on family status accommodation but was ignored.\n[129] Mr. Star confirmed that at Gateway, located adjacent to the Airport, there are multiple shifts there. There are 3 day, 12.5 hour shifts, many Monday to Friday day shifts, and Monday to Friday static afternoon shifts, etc. It is Mr. Star\u2019s observation that management at Gateway is more willing to accommodate worker requests for specific shifts and times. Gateway only operates from Sunday night through to Friday.\n[130] Mr. Star also confirmed that there was a management proposal for shift bidding on a rotational non-seniority based system that doesn\u2019t impact the needs of the CBSA operation. It has not been implemented however, because management and Union have not been able to ascertain a workable process that does not conflict with the VSSA. It was unclear whether this proposed shift bidding would have alleviated the Complainant\u2019s situation, and it was not relied on by either side as an answer to the issues before this hearing.\n[131] The Tribunal dealt with the Union\u2019s position in 2009 CHRT 14 as the Respondent applied to have the Union added as a party to this hearing on the basis that the Union may share responsibility for any discriminatory conduct that might be found because the VSSA prohibits the Respondent from acceding to the Complainant\u2019s hours accommodation requests. The Union took a position in support of the remedies sought by the Ms. Johnstone arguing that those remedies do not require changes to the collective agreement or the VSSA, but only for the Respondent to establish a policy of accommodation based on family status. The Tribunal dismissed the Respondent\u2019s application, finding that Ms. Johnstone had not made allegations against the Union nor was there any indication on the record that the collective agreement or the VSSA played a role in management\u2019s policies concerning the issues raised by her complaint.\n[132] Asked about BSOs working part-time Mr. Star said there were workers who work part-time for family reasons, due to medical restrictions, or by personal choice such as being close to retirement. Generally, when a request based on these reasons is put forward, the BSO sits down with management and a shift that accommodates the particular request is worked out. Generally, part-time workers work afternoon shifts (10 am to 8 pm; 12 pm to 10 pm). Afternoons are the busiest time at PIA so this fits neatly with management\u2019s operational goals.\n[133] As to his own accommodation for religious reasons, Mr. Star testified that every new shift period (now every 63 days) he sits down with his supervisor and they work out his unique shift. The process typically takes about 5 minutes: 3 to discuss and 2 to make the changes by computer on the shift schedule. He does not work late on Fridays or on Saturdays at all. Sundays are usually his longest day, i.e. 5:00 am to 3:15 pm. He works at different start times over static days.\n[134] Mr. Star stated that the granting of his accommodation request has not opened the floodgate on similar requests for religious accommodation. A couple of other BSOs came forward and were quickly dealt with, but that is the extent of it. As to family status requests, under cross-examination Mr. Star described himself as the maven\u2019 of the issue when he was on the Union executive, and that the majority of employees seeking accommodation for family responsibilities would come to him. He stated that not all seeking family status accommodation were seeking static shifts, but a number of them were. When challenged as to whether he and the Union believe that all such requests should be accommodated, he responded that he felt management should accommodate for this reason until it can show undue hardship such as morale being destroyed, the cost being prohibitive, or the occurrence of unacceptable layoffs that would occur.\n[135] Mr. Star testified that for BSOs, every hour worked is a pensionable hour, therefore if you work fewer hours you earn less pension benefits. Employee pension contributions are matched by the employer. Other benefits are also based on full-time hours worked of 37.5 hours in a week set as 100%, and therefore fewer hours worked normally lead to a pro-rating of those benefits.\n[136] Mr. Star confirmed that part-time staff are paid less for overtime hours put in. He also spoke to an exhibited Part-Time Agreement that management asked workers working part-time to sign, the content of which basically indicates that the signing worker agrees with being assigned part-time hours. This was in place at the time of the complaint, and continues to be used. When Mr. Star was part of the Union Executive, he recommended that staff not sign the Agreement as its language suggests that it operates to take away the worker\u2019s ability to return to full-time hours as of right. There was a concern that in the case of an employee who is forced to self-reduce such as Ms. Johnstone, the signing of such an Agreement could leave her unable to return to full-time shifts as of right when her circumstances changed. There was no evidence led that anyone who had not signed it suffered any repercussions, but that the proffering of it by management left the worker feeling that he or she should sign it as a condition of employment.\n[137] Mr. Star also confirmed that there is nothing in the VSSA that specifies the maximum number of hours that may be worked by a part-time employee, or limits part-time to 34 hours per week.\nC. Evidence of Expert, Dr. Linda Duxbury [138] Dr. Linda Duxbury was qualified as an expert in strategic Human Resources management including labour force demographics, managing change, and the impact of work-life balance issues on workers. The Respondent consented to Dr. Duxbury being qualified as an expert in these areas.\n[139] Dr. Duxbury filed a written report to address the accommodation needs of workers with child care responsibilities, and the nature and impact of any employer\u2019s response to accommodating those needs. In the preparation of her Report, she read the Statements of Particulars of both parties.\n[140] Dr. Duxbury is a fully tenured professor at Carleton University\u2019s Sprott School of Business where she teaches and supervises Masters and PhD courses on topics including organizational behavior, work-life balance issues, and managing change for employees. She also writes on attribution theory (the basic need to understand and explain the causes of other people's behavior) and managing organizational structure to maximize worker performance.\n[141] In addition, Dr. Duxbury engages in research, consulting and writing in her field. Her principle areas of research involve the managing of the people part of change, i.e. the impact and effects of workplace change on workers, and work-life balance demographics from a strategic point of view. This has been a 20 year field of study and consideration for Dr. Duxbury, and she has consulted with both the private and public sector.\n[142] Dr. Duxbury\u2019s work and database findings are globally recognized and cited. She spoke of Google Scholar which is a website where only academic referenced, peer-reviewed publications are posted. Her and her colleague\u2019s research is cited under key citations on that website. The authoritativeness of Google Scholar was not challenged by the Respondent.\n[143] A focus of Dr. Duxbury\u2019s report and testimony was on Role Overload where work interferes with family obligations and\/or family obligations interfere with one\u2019s work, to the point where the individual feels the stress of never having enough time, and tasks at hand are never complete.\n[144] Work interferes with Family is the descriptor for when a worker psychologically prefers his or her time spent at work to time spent attending to family obligations.\n[145] Family interferes with Work is the descriptor for when a worker will sacrifice work for family obligations, such as turning down a promotion, or taking part-time hours, etc.\n[146] Dr. Duxbury testified that workplace culture dominates as the predictor of whether a worker feels he\/she is in control of the family and workplace interface or not. Childcare availability that can be matched to your work duties makes a difference because there is less stress if the two can be matched.\n[147] Workplace culture, i.e. the reality of the workplace, is determined not by one\u2019s manager in terms of organizational charts, but the temperament and attitude of one\u2019s immediate manager, the person the worker reports to. According to Dr. Duxbury, workplace culture and demands are the big two factors impacting Work interferes with Family in Role Overload.\n[148] A good manager breeds loyalty in his or her team, but a bad manager who is overly demanding and unsympathetic breeds stress and resentment because a worker feels he\/she is not heard and not appreciated.\n[149] There has been a phenomenal increase in Canada in women in the workforce, and presently 2\/3 of Canadian families are headed by dual income earners. This is now the modal or norm in Canada. There are also more single working parents in the workforce than males working with a stay-at-home wife. Normally, the latter males earn more than the modal family.\n[150] 15% of the workforce, mostly dual income families, have young children. Younger children, defined as age 5 and under, mean increased demand on the parent(s) and reduced parental control over being able to choose variable shifts for work.\n[151] Dr. Duxbury emphasized that there is a disconnect often between policy and practice in the workplace. Practice is workplace culture, the worker\u2019s actual experience. Speaking generally, she stated that many organizations feel that they have done their bit by implementing stellar policies, but do not follow-up on implementation.\n[152] An example given by Dr. Duxbury was telework. She testified that there is an excellent federal government policy on telework, but in reality few engage in it other than on their own time because it is not encouraged by federal government employers.\n[153] As to 24\/7 operations, work schedules and accommodations have to be individualized to suit that workplace, but Dr. Duxbury felt there were very few operations where flexibility cannot be found if management looks to implement it.\n[154] Dr. Duxbury also commented that shift work is a major predictor of a dramatic increase for workers in work interferes with family and has the potential to be very problematic.\n[155] A lot of these competing tensions have been felt and borne more by women, but with a younger generation of male workers who want to participate more in family life, men are being increasingly impacted as well. The more society denies this reality, the harder it becomes to address it in a healthy way.\n[156] According to Dr. Duxbury the data is clear that the predictability of a fixed schedule allows a worker to set up her\/his support network effectively. As Canada moves into a seller\u2019s market (more jobs available than workers to fill those jobs), Dr. Duxbury poses the question as to how employers can afford not to accommodate workers with young children given the demographic changes in our nation.\n[157] Canada\u2019s fertility rate is critically low at 1.5. The fertility rate needs to be 2.1 to sustain itself and grow. During the baby boom after World War II, Canada\u2019s fertility rate was 4. This decrease will result in a significant shortage in personnel over the next 25 years.\n[158] The average Canadian enters the permanent workforce at 25. The average Canadian professional woman has her first child at age 31. This older age is a factor in the numbers of children being born because of fertility issues and time available.\n[159] Dr. Duxbury generally observed in her further testimony that recruitment, retention and succession planning have become crucial concerns in Canadian government and business enterprises. In a seller\u2019s market for labour, lack of accommodation creates a real challenge to recruit, retain and plan. In Dr. Duxbury\u2019s view, doing nothing in this regard has a real and increasing cost attached to it.\n[160] According to Dr. Duxbury, the costs associated with ignoring these demographic truths, changing attitudes toward work-life balance, and the impact on workers who are in the midst of trying to manage competing demands result in a workforce were:\n- people are overloaded, burned out, stressed, depressed, and have more mental health issues; - absenteeism increases due to health concerns and exhaustion; - workers are less committed, less loyal, and less satisfied; - prescription drug use increases; - workers are less engaged with lower job satisfaction; - there are higher turnover rates; - the public experiences poorer customer services as employees retire on the job; - more workers are planning to leave their employment because of family demands and a sense of not being valued.\n[161] The real benefit to an employer who is accommodating is the reversing of the above-listed trends. If an employee is in good mental and physical health with sufficient sleep and a feeling of being appreciated at work, Dr. Duxbury testified that it is a pretty safe assumption that such an employee will be more productive and perform better.\n[162] Dr. Duxbury testified that being valued is very important in the workplace. We easily have a concept of managing dollar capital but not human capital. A worker who wants to contribute needs to feel valued, i.e. recognized and appreciated. Otherwise, that worker will not give the employer the benefit of his\/her skills.\n[163] Where an employer is responsive to the concerns of its workforce, it is important to educate the rest of the workers so that they gain an awareness that any added benefit or perceived accommodation that another worker has now may be given to them when they are in need. In order to educate, the employer has to have policies that are unambiguous, transparent and which contain built-in accountability for mis-use. Such educative steps lead to attitudinal change.\n[164] Dr. Duxbury underscored her testimony by stating that the data is unequivocal that people will use health care facilities and health professionals less if these work-life balance issues are dealt with favourably. She stated that the number one coping method in Canada is cutting down on sleep. This is followed by drinking, smoking, eating poorly, and not exercising enough \u2013 all of which have negative health consequences.\n[165] Dr. Duxbury was asked by CHRC counsel whether an organization\u2019s impressionistic fear over great numbers seeking the same accommodation is well-founded. She responded in the negative because there are a range of people in or at a range of life cycle places with differing needs at any given time. Dr. Duxbury stated that her experience shows that people will generally use the accommodations they need and not misuse them. Her comment was that generally we don\u2019t give people enough credit.\n[166] As women make up 47% of Canada\u2019s workforce presently, Dr. Duxbury stated that unless accommodations are made for working women when their children are young, there will be fewer women available in the workforce or society will suffer from their choice to have fewer or no children.\n[167] Under cross-examination, Dr. Duxbury was challenged on the applicability of her database statistics to the present case. This Tribunal found that it was clear that Dr. Duxbury\u2019s data came from a broad range of workers from all sectors in many different job and career positions, who were asked a broad range of questions that addressed the workplace itself and attitudes toward the workplace.\n[168] Further, Dr. Duxbury made it clear that she was not suggesting that poor employees be rewarded, rather, that good management and employers who do not silo employee groups off from one another, benefit. She stated that treating each employee the same does not necessarily equate with fairness, as people and their needs are not the same. Some flexibility and individual assessment is appropriate and manageable.\n[169] In summary, Dr. Duxbury is stating that as a general framework for the workplace, good management and a supportive workplace culture is a win\/win combination for both employers and employees.\n[170] In the context of a workplace with rotational shifts, Dr. Duxbury acknowledges that shift work of this type is more problematic for employees, however some of the unpredictability can be alleviated by sufficient notice and the ability to trade shifts with colleagues. This adds to a worker\u2019s sense of control and her\/his ability to create support networks. She also noted that the shift a worker prefers today may not be the shift that worker prefers in two years, as a person\u2019s needs and demands change over time. The whole of Dr. Duxbury\u2019s evidence was presented as generally applicable to the CBSA workplace, but she had not personally observed nor drawn conclusions about the CBSA workplace specifically.\n[171] Dr. Duxbury opined that it is na\u00efve to suggest (as the Respondent does) that childcare issues are solely as a result of the employee\u2019s choice, when that employee is faced with housing and feeding a family. Dr. Duxbury posed the rhetorical question that although theoretically a person has choice, how real is that choice if there is only one legally and morally acceptable option? Dr. Duxbury\u2019s premise is that a person should not have to choose between raising a family and meaningful work that she\/he is trained for and has demonstrated his\/her ability to perform. She stated that in her opinion the worst employers are those that say they value work-life balance, but don\u2019t in fact.\n[172] Dr. Duxbury suggests that if an employer puts workable and understandable, fair policies in place, it is then up to the employee to make use of them. Workplace culture is based on observations of the actual environment, and that culture, one\u2019s immediate manager, and the ability to inject some flexibility and predictability into one\u2019s work life are the best indicators of success.\n[173] The best environment is to have policies in place, and then allow managers the authority to deal with people individually so that support is tangible and fits the need. Dr. Duxbury added to this by stating that once a request is satisfied, it is important for the manager to communicate to others the reasons why it was a good management decision. In the absence of transparency, people assume favouritism.\nD. Evidence of Expert, Martha Friendly [174] The Complainant tendered Martha Friendly for qualification as an expert on childcare policy in Canada, including childcare availability for people who work rotating and fluctuating shifts on an irregular basis. The Respondent objected to this characterization on the basis that Ms. Friendly had not personally engaged in empirical studies, but had only studied available data of which there is not an abundance and of which there is not recent data. The Respondent suggested that Ms. Friendly be accepted only as an expert on childcare policy in Canada. In accepting Ms. Friendly\u2019s qualifications as an expert on the basis put forward by the Complainant, this Tribunal found in the description of Ms. Friendly\u2019s long writing and teaching career, that she has an overall awareness of the general availability of childcare, both traditional and non-traditional, in Canada for all Canadian workers, and knowledge of factors that affect women in the workforce including the impact of childcare availability on Canadian working women. This Tribunal felt that any concerns that Respondent\u2019s counsel had with respect to the reliance on data that was insufficient or dated could be addressed in cross-examination.\n[175] Ms. Friendly is the Executive Director of the Childcare Resource and Research Unit CRRU in Toronto, Ontario. CRRU is a policy research facility concerned with early childhood education and childcare and family policy. She filed a written report to address the extent to which child care is accessible to employed parents who are working non-standard, rotating, unpredictable hours. The Respondent took the position that Ms. Johnstone had more childcare options that she presented herself as having, and Ms. Friendly\u2019s report was tendered by the Complainant to address that position. In the preparation of her Report, Ms. Friendly also reviewed the Statements of Particulars of both parties.\n[176] For over 30 years CRRU was part of the University of Toronto, but in 2007 became a separate non-profit organization in receipt of provincial and federal funding. Ms. Friendly is a specialist in policy concerning early childhood education and childcare. She is also part of an international childcare policy community that researches, analyzes data and writes on topics that arise by virtue of her specialization. She is a published author in her field and teaches in the Masters Program at Ryerson University.\n[177] Although her evidence revealed that Ms. Friendly is an advocate for increased public funding for childcare options, her evidence of interest to this hearing was her knowledge of availability of childcare in Canada, and there was no suggestion by the Respondent that her evidence on this relevant point was influenced by her policy positions.\n[178] Complainant\u2019s counsel characterized Ms. Friendly\u2019s evidence as meant to inform the Tribunal as to the bona fide difficulties a parent such as the Complainant faces in finding third party childcare, a difficulty shared by anyone in the position of the Complainant having young children and a workplace that requires rotational, fluctuating, and unpredictable shifts. This Tribunal found that Ms. Friendly\u2019s evidence on these points was reliable.\n[179] In her testimony, Ms. Friendly emphasized that the single most difficult factor in accommodating child care is unpredictability. Many factors go into child care decisions but unpredictability of a worker\u2019s schedule makes finding paid third-party provider daycare, regulated or unregulated, in a centre or in a private home, almost impossible.\n[180] Next most difficult is the need for extended hours, i.e. outside the standard operating hours of approximately 7 am to 6 pm on weekdays. Need on weekends and especially overnights makes availability virtually impossible as well.\n[181] Further, Ms. Friendly noted that available childcare spaces fluctuate. A provider who is caring for children in her own home, for example, may not operate such a service once her own children are of school age. However, others may open up that were not previously available.\n[182] As Ms. Friendly says there is largely no data on unregulated childcare in Canada, her evidence focused more on available regulated childcare which includes childcare centres and care provided in the care provider\u2019s home under provincial regulation. She testified that regulated child care facilities in Canada are very limited, and as a result unregulated care is commonly used. In other words, the need far outweighs the supply.\n[183] Reliable data on the availability of extended hours childcare in unregulated settings is likewise not readily available, but this Tribunal can accept anecdotal evidence on this issue supported by Ms. Johnstone\u2019s direct evidence.\n[184] Ms. Friendly provided some evidence on two major studies done in the 1990s on the availability of extended hour daycare. The results of these studies, not surprisingly, was that there are (or have been) a few programs that offer extended hours or weekend childcare, but there was little use made of weekend or overnight childcare and therefore it was not cost-effective enough to continue to be offered.\n[185] This supports Ms. Johnstone\u2019s position that the type of childcare she needed was not easily available if at all, and that there are relatively few workers who require third party assistance on this basis, i.e. there are few in number who work rotating fluctuating shifts with frequent overtime, who are also married to someone who works similar shifts.\n[186] Taking that reality a step further, coupled with Ms. Johnstone\u2019s direct evidence on point there are few BSOs who would need accommodation to work outside the VSSA on static shifts for any period of time. Most workers look first to their spouse, family and friends for childcare assistance, and only if this is not workable or sufficient do they then turn to third party caregivers. Ms. Friendly found it understandable, as does this Tribunal, that most parents would not be comfortable with third party overnight care of their young children.\n[187] It is doubtful that Ms. Johnstone or anyone in her similar situation as outlined would find any third party other than family willing to provide reliable childcare for young children based on an unpredictable schedule, even if that schedule is confined to 3 days per week. The provider has set hours and a separate life to live, and even family has to be locally accessible to the worker, therefore unpredictability is devastating for this purpose.\n[188] By using family members over a 3 day period, albeit that she and her husband had to transport her children to 3 different locations on these days, she was able to propose to her employer the most flexible schedule availability possible for her at the time: the same 3 days per week, but not restricted as to start times, location, or length of shifts, and able to accommodate overtime and full BSO responsibilities.\n[189] Ms Friendly testified to funding and cost barriers that exist for typical Canadian families. Government-backed maternity leave periods have lengthened over the past 30+ years, moving to a full year in 2003. Over the same time period, government tax credits and child benefit programs have also increased for families. This has helped, and is not offered in every country such as the United States. As a result, U.S. data on this topic is largely unreliable when discussing Canada.\n[190] Also, there are subsidies available to lower income families (but only if regulated childcare is used), but not to middle income families. The majority of Canadian families including Ms. Johnstone\u2019s, fall into the middle income category by definition and these are the ones who have difficulty affording third party care, but have too much income to qualify for subsidies.\n[191] Ms. Friendly quoted one of the main American experts in her field, Harriet Presser (a demographer at Harvard University), who wrote a 2003 book on the subject. Ms. Presser stated that it is rare that you have two people working unpredictable shifts who are a couple, and that the main arrangement for most couples is spouses and family. Ms. Presser has written extensively in this area and coined the term split shift families referring to dual income couples who work different shift schedules in order to accommodate childcare.\n[192] CBSA\u2019s counsel asked Ms. Friendly numerous questions under cross-examination about the many factors that go into a parent\u2019s decision to access third party childcare. Ms. Friendly acknowledged that many factors go into such choices including cost, type of care, location, availability, quality, and comfort with the provider. The type of shift and hours worked is not the only determining factor.\n[193] Although it seems evident that any number of factors may go into individual choices, this complaint deals with a situation where there was no available third party childcare in any event to cover Ms. Johnstone\u2019s work schedule, and neither her spouse nor other family members could fill the void entirely.\n[194] In such a situation as this, the parent either must seek accommodation through her\/his employer or no longer work for that employer (an alternative covered in Dr. Duxbury\u2019s testimony). Ms. Johnstone wanted to make a career with CBSA. She had invested time, taken training specifically for the position, and enjoyed the work. By her performance reviews and her own assessment she was good at her job. It does not seem unreasonable to this Tribunal that Ms. Johnstone would want to remain employed with CBSA, and would ask for accommodation on her shift schedule until the children were of school age, i.e. up to age 5\/6.\n[195] Ultimately, Ms. Friendly confirmed that the ability of a parent to find suitable third party childcare falls on a continuum of difficulty depending on that particular parent\u2019s needs. She stated that she felt that Ms. Johnstone\u2019s situation was one of the most difficult childcare situations that she could imagine based on: different shifts at different times and different days including weekends; overtime; shifts at all hours of the day or night; and her spouse worked a similar type of job schedule.\nE. Prima Facie Case [196] The test to establish a prima facie case is set out in Martin v. Saulteaux Band Government (2002) CanLII 23560 (C.H.R.T.) at paragraph 24 (Martin), and Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpson Sears Limited, (O\u2019Malley), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28 (O\u2019Malley).\n[197] Essentially, a prima facie case is established if the allegations by the Complainant are covered, and if believed, the evidence is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in Ms. Johnstone\u2019s favour, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. If the Tribunal answers in the affirmative to this, then the onus shifts to the Respondent to show that despite the discrimination found it had a Bona Fide Occupational Requirement (BFOR) to engage in it, and that accommodation of those affected would amount to undue hardship for the employer.\n[198] At this stage, the two questions before this Tribunal are:\n- Did CBSA engage in a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to Ms. Johnstone, on the prohibited ground of family status?\n- Did CBSA engage in a discriminatory practice by establishing or pursuing a policy or practice, or did the CBSA enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment, that deprived or tended to deprive Ms. Johnstone of any employment opportunities on the prohibited ground of family status?\n[199] In the ordinary course, to establish a prima facie case the Complainant need only demonstrate that a policy has had some differential impact on her due to a personal characteristic which is recognized as a prohibited ground of discrimination. Morris v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [2005] F.C.J. No. 731, at paras. 27-28 (Morris)\n[200] In this inquiry, the ground of discrimination alleged is family status. There is a difference in position between the parties as to the definition of family status within the meaning of Sections 3, 7 and 10 of the Act, and therefore this Tribunal must address the meaning of family status before it can determine whether a prima facie case has been made out.\n[201] Additionally, it is the position of CBSA, that the ground of family status carries with it a higher burden of proof to establish a prima facie case, than other grounds enumerated under the Act. In this proposition, CBSA, relies on the case of Health Sciences Association of British Columbia v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] C.H.R.D. No. 33 (Campbell River), and subsequent decisions of provincial human rights tribunals and federal arbitrators that have followed Campbell River\u2019s approach on this issue.\nFamily Status\n[202] Turning first to what it is meant by family status in the Act, Ms. Johnstone cites the previous CHRT rulings in Brown initially discussed in Section IV above, and Wolden v. Lynn, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 18 (Wolden).\n[203] The facts in Brown are very similar to this complaint and the Respondent in Brown is the predecessor of the CBSA. The CHRT found that the complaint was substantiated in Brown, and in doing so considered the nature of family status.\n[204] At page 15 of Brown, the Tribunal defined the ground of family status as follows:\n\u2026the evidence must demonstrate that at an family status includes the status of being a Parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations.\n[205] At page 20 of the Brown decision, the Tribunal stated that the ground of family status contemplated:\n\u2026 duties and obligations within the family, and that the purposive interpretation to be affixed to s.2 of the CHRA is a clear recognition within the context of family status\u2019 of a parent\u2019s rights and duty to strike a balance coupled with a clear duty on the part of any employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance within the criteria set out in the Alberta Dairy Pool case. To consider any lesser approach to the problems facing the modern family within the employment environment is to render meaningless the concept of family status\u2019 as a ground of discrimination.\n[206] Ms. Johnstone argues that it is well established that the purpose of human rights legislation is to protect and enshrine the rights and dignity of Canadian. As a result, human rights codes must be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner.\n[207] Ms. Johnstone also relies on B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [2002] S.C.J. No. 67 B. v. Ontario at paras. 44 \u2013 45, wherein the art confirmed that to establish discrimination, family status claimants need only demonstrate that they were arbitrarily disadvantaged on the basis of family status. In other words, the Supreme Court adopted a broad and liberal interpretation to the Act.\n[208] Ms. Johnstone agrees that the family obligation at issue must be substantial, however once that determination is made, then the Complainant states that interference with that obligation is sufficient to make out a prima facie case.\n[209] Ms. Johnstone also raised the cases of Hoyt v. Canadian National Railway, [2006] C.H.R.D. No.33 (Hoyt). In Hoyt, the Complainant was a railway worker who sought accommodation from her employer to work a certain shift that would allow her to make childcare arrangements for her child. Again, the CHRT accepted that the scope of family status as encompassing childcare obligations of the nature faced by Ms. Johnstone.\n[210] The interpretation that family status within the meaning of the Act includes family and parental obligations that include childcare has been adopted in numerous decisions:\nWight v. Ontario (Office of the Legislative Assembly), [1998] O.H.R.B.I.D. No. 13 (Wight)\nCanada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Post Workers (Somerville Grievance, CUPW 790-03-00008, Arb. Lanyon), [2006] C.L.A.D. No. 371 at para. 66\nRennie v. Peaches and Cream Skin Care Ltd., (December 4, 2006) Human Rights Panel of Alberta (unreported) at paras. 51, 53-54\nCanadian Staff Union v. Canadian Union of Public Employees (Reynolds Grievance), [2006] N.S.L.A.A. No. 15\nOntario Public Service Employees Union v. Ontario Public Service Staff Union (DeFreitas Grievance), [2005] O.L.A.A. No. 396 at paras. 19 -21\n[211] This Tribunal notes that even the Campbell River decision and decisions that have followed that ruling and adopted the same approach, still accepted that childcare obligations are within the scope of the definition of family status within the Act. The debate between this line of cases and those cited by Ms. Johnstone is with the threshold required in such cases to establish a prima facie case, not with the meaning of family status.\n[212] The B.C. Court of Appeal in Campbell River reversed the arbitrator\u2019s decision on this point and acknowledged that childcare responsibilities (in this case by a mother to provide for a son with behavioural problems) are within the scope of family status.\n[213] The same can be said of the Federal Court\u2019s judicial review of the initial CHRC dismissal of Ms. Johnstone\u2019s claim, referred to in paragraph 68 above. Mr. Justice Barnes, in overturning the CHRC dismissal of Ms. Johnstone\u2019s complaint, took no exception to her complaint falling within the definition of family status within the Act. This decision focused on a criticism of the approach taken in the Campbell River line of cases as to whether interference is sufficient, or one has to find a serious interference with the Complainant\u2019s protected interests. Johnstone v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J. No.43 (Johnstone)\n[214] CBSA argues for a more restrictive interpretation claiming that the law on this point is unsettled.\n[215] CBSA proposes that protection is not provided with respect to family obligations at all, as only distinctions based on one\u2019s actual or absolute status of being in a family relationship is meant with the inclusion of family status in the Act. CBSA denies that protection extends to the activities or responsibilities relating to one\u2019s status as a parent.\n[216] In B. v. Ontario the Supreme Court of Canada spoke to the term status as implying membership in a class or group encompassing both the absolute definition and the relative definition requiring the existence or absence of a relationship with another person. The decision, as stated, also spoke to an arbitrary disadvantage suffered, but did not set out a comprehensive definition of family status within the meaning of the Ontario Human Rights Code, which is provincial legislation akin to the federal Act. At paragraph 57 of the decision, the Court did speak of a person experiencing differential treatment on the basis of an irrelevant personal characteristic that is enumerated.\n[217] CBSA urges this Tribunal not to follow earlier CHRT decisions in Brown, Wolden and Hoyt. CBSA suggests that this Tribunal adopt a purposive interpretation that does not overshoot the actual purpose of the right or freedom as stated in R. v. Big M Drug Mart, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295, para. 117.\n[218] CBSA warns against the perils of an approach that presumes any conflict between work and family obligations amounts to discrimination on the ground of family status. In this regard, CBSA cites the case of McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employes de Hopital General de Montreal, [2007] S.C.J. No. 4, at para. 49, per Abella J. (McGill), to assert that family status should not be interpreted as favouring and promoting particular familial arrangements as not every situation cannot be afforded the protection, but only those that are truly discriminatory.\n[219] This Tribunal does not find Madam Justice Abella\u2019s statement in conflict with the complaint put before us by Ms. Johnstone.\n[220] This Tribunal agrees that not every tension that arises in the context of work-life balance can or should be addressed by human rights jurisprudence, but this is not the argument put forward in the present case. Ms. Johnstone\u2019s argument is that such protection should be given where appropriate and reasonable given the circumstances as presented.\n[221] As discussed above, we are addressing here a real parent to young children obligation and a substantial impact on that parent\u2019s ability to meet that obligation. It is not before this Tribunal to address any and all family obligations and any and all conflict between an employee\u2019s work and those obligations.\n[222] CBSA set out in its written submissions information on the history of the ground family status being included in the Act and provincial human rights codes, including a reference from Hansard quoting the then federal Minister of Justice\u2019s address on December 20, 1982. The Minister of Justice, 27 years ago, stated that the inclusion of family status means you cannot have guilt by association or failure to employ somebody by association because someone else in his family has a weakness of some kind\u2026You cannot use this as reason to deny this person employment. Each person is to be judged on his or her own merits and abilities, not on his family status.\n[223] In Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid, 2005 SCC 30, the Supreme Court of Canada applied Elmer Driedger\u2019s modern approach to statutory interpretation to the Act, referencing his 2nd edition book Construction of Statutes. This approach specifies that: the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. In other words, the supposed intention of Parliament, to the extent that this can be divined from the words of a Minister, is not the only determinative factor. This is especially so when the context and the scheme of the Act suggest otherwise.\n[224] When the Minister made the statement in 1982 relied upon by the Respondent, the duty to accommodate in employment did not appear in the CHRA. More particularly, the phrase have their needs accommodated was not in the purpose clause of the Act (s. 2). The inclusion of this concept in the purpose clause, as separate and distinct from its inclusion in s. 15, has led to a broadening of interpretation of the Act, in that equal opportunity has come to mean more than just not being hindered by stereotypes or prejudice (guilt by association). It involves taking into account people\u2019s needs. Accordingly, family status in this Tribunal\u2019s view should not be limited to identifying one as a parent or a familial relation of another person. It should include the needs and obligations that naturally flow from that relationship.\n[225] While the historical context put forward by the Respondent is a factor, this Tribunal does not find it persuasive as an exhaustive understanding of the present meaning of family status within the Act, given the legislative changes and jurisprudence that has evolved and developed over the more recent past.\n[226] CBSA also cites the Whyte grievance and the Simcoe Country District School Board and Ontario Public Service Employees Union, Local 330, (2002), 103 L.A.C. (4th) 309 (Griffith) grievance.\n[227] In Whyte the onus was put entirely on the employee to bear any burden associated with working for a twenty-four hour, seven day a week enterprise such as a railway. The decision finds that in exchange for meeting those onerous obligations railway employees have gained the benefit of relatively generous wage and benefit protections. This suggests that an employer can discriminate as long as it pays well, and without a definition as to what relatively generous means or what comparative is being used.\n[228] In Griffith, a parent who sought to use sick leave credits to leave work early twice a week to meet her child\u2019s needs was denied. The arbitrator found the employer\u2019s refusal did not amount to discrimination on the basis of family status.\n[229] This Tribunal does not find the Whyte or Griffith grievance decisions persuasive.\n[230] Both parties rely on their own interpretation of Section 2 of the Act as it relates to their arguments, but this Tribunal finds nothing in Section 2 that creates a restrictive and narrow interpretation of family status.\n[231] To the contrary, the underlying purpose of the Act as stated is to provide all individuals a mechanism to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society\u2026 It is reasonable that protections so afforded include those naturally arising from one of the most fundamental societal relationships that exists, that of parent to child. The fact that the language of Section 2 mentions lives that they are able and wish to have carries with it the acknowledgement that individuals do make separate choices, including to have children, and that the Act affords protection against discrimination with respect to those choices.\n[232] CBSA relies on Schaap v. Canada (Canadian Armed Forces), [1988] F.C.J. (Schaap), a case dealing with marital status discrimination in the assigning of military housing, and quoted Justice Marceau from page 3 of that decision in its final submissions. Taking some of the same quotations used by CBSA, this Tribunal interprets them for purposes of this complaint differently. His Lordship stated that decisions are to be made on the basis of individual worth or qualities and not of group stereotypes. He went on to posit as follows: \u2026is not this in perfect keeping with the purpose of all human rights enactments\u2026.to prevent the victimization of individuals on the grounds of irrelevant characteristics over which they have no control, or with respect to which their freedom of choice is so vital that it should in no way be constrained by the fear of eventual discriminatory consequences\u2026\n[233] This Tribunal finds that the freedom to choose to become a parent is so vital that it should not be constrained by the fear of discriminatory consequences. As a society, Canada should recognize this fundamental freedom and support that choice wherever possible. For the employer, this means assessing situations such as Ms. Johnstone\u2019s on an individual basis and working together with her to create a workable solution that balances her parental obligations with her work opportunities, short of undue hardship.\n[234] Having found that the enumerated ground of family status does include childcare responsibilities of the type and duration experienced by Ms. Johnstone, one has to then turn to the two questions set out in paragraph 199 above, to determine whether Ms. Johnstone has made out a prima facie case on this ground absent CBSA\u2019s response in keeping with Martin and O\u2019Malley.\n[235] Again, the parties differ on what is required for Ms. Johnstone to make out a prima facie case. Ms. Johnstone adopts the low threshold set out in Morris. Following B. v. Ontario would also allow that Ms. Johnstone need only show that she was arbitrarily disadvantaged based on her family status. This Tribunal finds that CBSA adopted an unwritten policy and practice of arbitrarily forcing any person who sought accommodation for reasons of family obligations such as childcare for young children, to work 34 hours per week or less in exchange for a schedule outside the regular VSSA schedule. Although CBSA made individual assessments and changes for those seeking accommodation on medical and religious grounds, and broke their own arbitrary policy fairly often, CBSA was unyielding in Ms. Johnstone\u2019s case.\n[236] CBSA adopts the reasoning in Campbell River that there is a different and higher threshold for family status discrimination cases. In Campbell River, the Court found that the CHRT\u2019s rulings in both Brown and Wolden were overly broad. The B.C. Court of Appeal did not follow the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s direction in O\u2019Malley and British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. The Government of the Province of British Columbia as represented by the Public Service Employee Relations Commission, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin).\n[237] Instead, Campbell River adopts a new and greater test where a determination of bad faith on the part of the employer is undertaken, and the analysis calls for a change in a term or condition of employment which results in a serious interference with a substantial parental duty or obligation of the employee. Hoyt rejected this restrictive analysis as does this Tribunal.\n[238] This Tribunal agrees with Ms. Johnstone\u2019s position that an individual should not have to tolerate some amount of discrimination to a certain unknown level before being afforded the protection of the Act. Justice Barnes agreed with this position in Johnstone. Either there is or is not discrimination found in any given complaint process. If so, there cannot be a hierarchy of grounds. The Act does not suggest this.\n[239] In the recent decision of Rajotte v. The President of the Canadian Border Services Agency et al, 2009, PSST 0025 dated August 7, 2009 (Rajotte), the Public Service Staffing Tribunal considered a complaint by a female employee against the same Respondent as in this complaint. The Complainant was a mother who alleged that she had not been considered for a certain position or positions due to an abuse of authority by the CBSA and her family status.\n[240] The Tribunal in Rajotte followed the reasoning and decisions in Brown, Wolden, Hoyt, and Johnstone with respect to the definition of family status, as well as the test for a prima facie case set out in O\u2019Malley and Meiorin. Rajotee expressly rejects the approach in Campbell River.\n[241] CBSA sought leave to address the Rajotte case before this Tribunal as Rajotte was released just two weeks after submissions were completed in this hearing. However, this Tribunal decided that further submissions were unnecessary. Rajotte is self-explanatory and this Tribunal finds it relevant to this complaint, although not binding.\n[242] This Tribunal finds that Ms. Johnstone has made out a prima facie case of discrimination contrary to Sections 7 and 10 of the Act, in that CBSA engaged in a discriminatory and arbitrary practice in the course of employment that adversely differentiated Ms. Johnstone on the prohibited ground of family status. CBSA engaged in a discriminatory practice by establishing and pursuing an unwritten policy communicated to and followed by management that affected Ms. Johnstone\u2019s employment opportunities including, but not limited to promotion, training, transfer, and benefits on the prohibited ground of family status.\n[243] The policy and practice that CBSA established and pursued is based in a view that family status within the meaning of the Act does not include family obligations of the nature of Ms. Johnstone\u2019s. CBSA forced Ms. Johnstone to self-reduce to part-time status thereby adversely affecting her with respect to employment.\n[244] CBSA accommodates those seeking accommodation for medical and religious reasons by creating schedules for them outside the VSSA, some on a permanent basis. Additionally, CBSA has not uniformly followed this arbitrary discriminatory unwritten policy resulting in some employees in the same category as Ms. Johnstone being accommodated with full-time hours and static shifts, or full-time benefits although on part-time hours and static shifts\n[245] It is pertinent to note that the CBSA and its predecessors have been under CHRT and CHRC direction since 1993 to develop accommodation policies for those seeking accommodation on the ground of family status and has been aware that those bodies have interpreted family status as equating to family responsibilities of the type and nature that Ms. Johnstone faced. Ms. Johnstone\u2019s testimony was unequivocal that she was not asked about her personal situation or the difficulties she was facing, but dealt with according to the above-described arbitrary unwritten policy of either working under the VSSA or self-reducing to up to 34 hours if seeking static shifts. There was no attempt to individualize Ms. Johnstone\u2019s situation by CBSA, because they have not treated such requests as falling within the ambit of federal human rights legislation.\n[246] This Tribunal asked Mr. Star if there is anyone at CBSA working now or in the past two years with the title Employment Equity Advisor or Disability and Accommodation Case Coordinator, as recommended in the Draft policy, and there is none.\n[247] Mr. Star testified that there are two named Supervisors that specifically coordinate (and monitor) the medical accommodation issues. They do not have decision-making authority. There is a committee made up of Mr. Norm Sheridan, Ms. Rhonda Raby, Mr. Darren Millet and perhaps others that look at case by case medical accommodation requests.\n[248] When this Tribunal asked who dealt with accommodation requests for reasons other than medical, Mr. Star testified that the same two Supervisors amass the information, and put the requests forward to the same committee to make the decision.\n[249] Further this Tribunal asked Mr. Star if a CBSA National Job Accommodation Fund exists as recommended in the Draft policy, and there is none.\nVI. Respondent\u2019s Case A. Evidence of Norm Sheridan [250] Mr. Sheridan is the District Director of Passenger Operations for CBSA at PIA, one district within the CBSA\u2019s Greater Toronto region operation. He has held that senior position since April 1, 1999 under CBSA\u2019s predecessors as well.\n[251] The position of CBSA, as articulated by Mr. Sheridan and Respondent\u2019s counsel, is that workers seeking accommodation for childcare obligations are doing so due to choices they have made in life, for which the employer bears no responsibility. Hence, while the Respondent is prepared to make some adjustments to such a worker\u2019s schedule, it refers to these adjustments as arrangements as opposed to accommodations.\n[252] Prior, as stated above in paragraph 58, Mr. Sheridan held senior management, operations and human resources portfolios within PIA and the Greater Toronto Regional Office. Overall, Mr. Sheridan has worked for CBSA or its predecessors since 1979 starting as a Customs Inspector.\n[253] Because of his extensive background with the Respondent employer and his senior responsibilities, Mr. Sheridan was very knowledgeable about CBSA structure as it relates to the functions at PIA, and as it relates to this hearing. He had an excellent recall of dates of transition from one predecessor of CBSA to another. He confirmed that CBSA was created as of December 12, 2003.\n[254] Upon the creation of CBSA, the customs parts were taken out of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA), the immigration inland enforcement piece out of Citizenship and Immigration, and the food, plant and animal inspection piece out of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. As of October 8, 2004, the port of entry component of Citizenship and Immigration joined CBSA to create the full agency as it is known today.\n[255] Mr. Sheridan described the mandate of CBSA as at January 2004 at PIA as the facilitation of movement of low risk persons and goods into Canada, while at the same time detecting and interdicting high risk persons and goods including agricultural products such as plants, and animals. This was all done as part of providing for the safety and security of Canadians.\n[256] At that time, the immigration component of the port of entry piece had not yet come over to PIA, however, the long-standing customs mandate gave CBSA at PIA authority to perform primary immigrations functions or front end screening.\n[257] In 2004, there were 3 operating Terminals including the East Hold mentioned previously. BSO responsibilities at Passenger Operations included and still include:\n- The primary inspection line PIL: where the public sees inspectors in booths; - Immigration: where travelers are referred by the PIL such as first-time immigrants, refugee claimants, those holding visas, and persons who should not be allowed entry due to criminality; and - Customs secondary Secondary: where travelers pay duties, and taxes and baggage is inspected.\n[258] PIL determines whether to refer a traveler to Secondary where BSOs look at travelers\u2019 documents, the reason for the referral, and determine what other steps have to be taken including detention or seizure. The referral is primarily done through a coding system written on a traveler\u2019s customs declaration.\n[259] There are still a few BSOs who have not been trained in the full range of current duties in Food, Immigration and Customs. Since July 2005, the regular training of BSOs at Rigault, Quebec now includes training in all duties including familiarization with all relevant legislation. This includes Control and Defensive Tactics Training (CDP Training), and all the processes a BSO would have to do in the ordinary course of one\u2019s work. BSO training takes approximately 14 weeks. There is further training available as well, and some training given later is location specific.\n[260] BSOs are responsible for the control of firearms, controlled substances, agricultural goods including plants, animals, seeds and dairy products. The inspection of goods can also include explosives, telecommunication products, precious metals, drugs, weapons, child pornography, and controlled goods such as cultural properties, historic artifacts, precious gems like diamonds, etc.\n[261] At Gateway, Mr. Sheridan described the BSO work as the examination of mail coming into Canada including parcels and documents handled at both a primary and secondary inspection line. The BSO work at Commercial Operations involved limited interaction with people where the focus is primarily on good imported into Canada for commercial purposes.\n[262] Mr. Sheridan confirmed that BSO work performed in 2004 and currently at Passenger Operations, Commercial Operations and Gateway is set forth in one universal job description and classification.\n[263] Mr. Sheridan described the Director\u2019s Role, i.e. Mr. Sheridan\u2019s role as ensuring the efficient and effective operation at PIA for the processing of travelers and their goods. This is done through 10 subordinate Chiefs of Operations. Each of those Operational Chiefs, with the exception of one working on a particular project have Superintendents who report to them. The Superintendents are each assigned a crew of BSOs for whom they are responsible, and it is the BSOs on the front lines who get the job done.\n[264] Mr. Sheridan stated that he is given a budget allocation every year by his boss, the Regional Director General for the Greater Toronto Region. There is an expectation that he constantly look at his program and identify ways to improve on the program within the parameters and guidelines set out by the Region, and within the applicable legislative framework.\n[265] Mr. Sheridan was taken through extensive detail on the PIA operations and structure, produced organizational charts, and various example work schedules to show the intricacies of the VSSA as a BSO works through any given period on rotating, fluctuating shifts.\n[266] Although extensive testimony was given on PIA operations, the most pertinent testimony from Mr. Sheridan with regard to the complaint before this Tribunal, centered around CBSA rationale regarding accommodation requests, CBSA\u2019s view of such requests based on family responsibilities, the methodology used to deal with medical and religious accommodations, and the manner in which CBSA and its predecessors have dealt with the various pronouncements set out in Part IV above regarding the treatment of family status requests within CBSA and at PIA specifically.\n[267] There is no doubt that PIA is a busy international operation with an important mandate that by necessity operates round the clock to fulfill that mandate. Ultimately, however, this Tribunal found that the level of detail on operations did not really assist in the fundamental questions before it.\n[268] CBSA does not view employees who require accommodation for childcare responsibilities as a group that falls within the protection of the Act. CBSA\u2019s position is that such employees who cannot work the VSSA shift schedule, have the options of working part-time, taking Care and Nurturing Leave from 3 weeks to 5 years (leave without pay), or quitting. Mr. Sheridan\u2019s summed up the position as People make their own choices.\n[269] Under cross-examination Mr. Sheridan testified that all non-medical accommodation requests are referred to separately as arrangements including requests based on family reasons, lifestyle choices, educational requirements, and religious observance. He stated that previously all of these requests had been referred to by management as accommodations but there was an active decision taken to get control over the real situation by separating the language out to better describe the difference.\n[270] When asked under cross-examination if there were many requests from employees returning from maternity leave or those with children to be accommodated outside of the VSSA, Mr. Sheridan replied in the negative.\n[271] Mr. Sheridan pointed out that under the Collective Agreement there are a number of differently titled Leave Without Pay provisions for parents, as well as other assistance such as the Employee Assistance Program that provides free services for a range of issues like referrals for medical concerns, referrals for elder and childcare, and counseling for addictions and mental illness.\n[272] Mr. Sheridan stated that he was personally unaware of CCRA\u2019s or CBSA\u2019s strategies and goals to support work-life balance, and that he had seen nothing on the issue from Headquarters. Even though he had been Director of Human Resources in the Greater Toronto Area region of CBSA in 1993 when Brown was decided, he has no knowledge of any policies arising from that decision being adopted by the CBSA or its predecessors.\n[273] With reference to the operational reason for the VSSA, Mr. Sheridan testified that rotating all BSOs through a 24 hour shift schedule allows employees to equally share in both popular and unpopular shift times. It also exposes BSOs to different types of travelers and different degrees of traffic.\n[274] Midnight shifts are the least popular, however some employees prefer to work only the midnight shift. As a result, in the latest VSSA at PIA static midnight shifts have been incorporated.\n[275] Mr. Sheridan also testified that the new VSSA allows some employees to work static days of the week, i.e. Thursday through Sundays or Fridays through Monday. This is offered primarily to new employees known as Port of Entry Recruits. These BSOs are assigned to the Dedicated Coverage Team. This, of course, is what Ms. Johnstone had asked for \u2013 static days with no particular shift within those days sought.\n[276] Mr. Sheridan confirmed that he had no hand in the decision to create and maintain an Accommodations Log at PIA which he had seen being used since about 2000-2001. He recalled that management needed to manage accommodation requests. At one time anyone who was part-time was placed on the Accommodations Log regardless of the reason that the employees had moved to part-time. There was about 32 \u2013 35 people listed on the Log.\n[277] Mr. Sheridan testified that his boss, the Regional Director, wanted to separate out medical accommodations from other umbrella reasons for better tracking. Some employees had a dual reason for wanting to work outside the VSSA, so they stayed listed on the Accommodations Log. Otherwise, if an employee was being accommodated for medical reasons, their names were no longer entered on the Log. Medical accommodations were seen and treated as Human Resources issues, but other requests as purely operational.\n[278] Mr. Sheridan testified that over the past several years it had become necessary from a management perspective to better manage employees working part-time to improve consistency. It was felt, for example, that there were certain employees working a 36 hour week in order to get the flexibility and perhaps static shifts that can be afforded with part-time status outside the VSSA. For this reason, an unwritten policy was adopted that anyone working part-time should be allowed to work only to a weekly maximum of 34 hours. It was felt that this would discourage employees from seeking part-time status so close to full-time hours, just to get around the VSSA.\n[279] Because of the decision to treat employees seeking accommodation for childcare obligations as reflecting just personal choice (the same as someone who went back to school or chose part-time for lifestyle reasons) this brought such employees within the ambit of the 34 hour maximum policy for part-time.\n[280] Another unwritten CBSA policy is that part-time employees should not work greater than 10 hours per day. Mr. Sheridan expressed concern that an employees work performance might suffer in terms of energy and focus, if permitted to work a longer day. This is why Ms. Johnstone was told that she could not work a 13 hour shift 3 days per week, but only 10 hours 3 days per week, with another 4 on a separate fourth day.\n[281] However, Mr. Sheridan acknowledged that there are part-time employees working more than 10 hours per day, and that this has been permitted if it also meets operational needs. In addition, Mr. Sheridan conceded that both today and in 2004 many part-time BSOs were working shifts longer than 10 hours and some more than 34 hours per week.\n[282] Gateway and land border sites, for example, have many employees working greater than 10 hour shifts as well. Certainly, at the land border sites Mr. Sheridan agreed that BSOs must be ever-vigilant and prepared to meet and deal with the unexpected.\n[283] CBSA offered no evidence to substantiate this impressionistic view that a BSO shift of more than 10 hours would have a negative operational and performance impact.\n[284] Mr. Sheridan agreed with the other witnesses that the time of greatest operational demand at PIA is the afternoon period from approximately 14:00 to 22:00 hours. As it turns out, the majority of part-time employees who have the option of working a preferred static shift, choose this time period. Mr. Sheridan acknowledged that this alignment would make accommodation on a full-time basis fairly easy, and Ms. Johnstone was willing to work over this time period on the 3 days she requested. However, its arbitrary policy was in place and there was no individual assessment of Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request as outlined.\n[285] With medical accommodation requests separated out from other arrangements, and the recognized requirement by CBSA that such accommodations are required under human rights legislation, a system has evolved to deal with medical request on an individualized basis. Two managers are tasked with coordinating and monitoring such requests, i.e. gathering in medical documentation and other factual background information to package the request.\n[286] The request is then sent on to a regional committee is called the Accommodations Subcommittee. This committee, upon which Mr. Sheridan sits, is composed of CBSA management representatives. It meets regularly, and is given a schedule of requests to consider with the relevant background information. Decisions are taken at this level to grant the request, ask for further information or clarification, or deny it with reasons given. To assist in these decisions, the committee members follow a CBSA policy called Interim Guidelines for Medical Accommodations.\n[287] Minutes of these meetings were not produced until mid-way through the hearing after Mr Sheridan had testified to the existence and practices of the committee. Those minutes revealed that the committee does have before it accommodation requests other than for medical which Mr. Sheridan testified should not have been brought before the committee. The minutes also revealed that at times accommodations requests had been granted for employees who had children with medical needs.\n[288] In other words, CBSA at PIA has found an efficient and individualized way to deal with medical accommodation requests. It also has accommodated an employee with a child with medical needs, but it will not recognize nor individually assess an employee who seeks accommodation to care for a healthy child or children.\n[289] Mr. Sheridan was asked under cross-examination if his operating budget constrained CBSA\u2019s ability to respond to accommodation requests, and whether CBSA was under any budget constraints that prevented it from accommodating Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request specifically. Mr. Sheridan\u2019s response was, no.\n[290] In a follow-up question, Mr. Sheridan was asked if CBSA\/he had taken any steps to assess the costs of not addressing work-life balance issues. His response was, no.\n[291] Mr. Sheridan confirmed that the Treasury Board is the legal employer of BSOs and that he would have to be given directives on work-life balance issues from Treasury Board.\n[292] An exhibit was put to Mr. Sheridan aimed at 24\/7 operations and authored by Human Resources and Skills Development Canada with the heading, Work\/Life Balance and New Workplace Challenges \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions for Organizations Work\/Life Balance FAQs. He was asked what he has done to respond to these directives.\n[293] Mr. Sheridan responded that we negotiated a VSSA to allow greater flexibility to allow employees to get that predictability. This new VSSA allows regular employees more time off on weekends. Mr. Sheridan also felt that the imposed 34 hour or less part-time schedule for those seeking family status accommodation was, in itself, consistent with supporting work-life balance.\n[294] Among the information in the Work\/Life Balance FAQs was the following:\nHow can our organization do this when we are expected to operate in a 24-7 environment? There isn\u2019t any work environment, any job, any position, that can\u2019t be in some way designed to allow the individual to achieve a sense of work-life balance. The real question is, how can we, in a 24-7 environment, a shift work environment\u2026.create a workplace that recognizes work-life and well being as critically important for individual and organizational resiliency, for short-term and long-term success. Organizations need to take a look at \u2026 workload, to work structure, to work systems, to work-life, to wellness, to safety, to health.\nIf our organization begins to support work-life balance, how can we be sure that no everyone will want a flexible arrangement? What we know is that most people prefer their work life to be fairly predictable, fairly routine, and fairly consistent from one week to the next. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a night shift worker or a day shift worker or a Monday to Friday 9 to 5-er. Most employees are looking for predictability and consistency. The myth about flex is people come and go whenever they want. They take time off and they get paid for it and other people get stuck doing the work. In fact, a flexible working arrangement requires clear communication, negotiation and documentation of the way of working in a consistent way.\nWhat can organizations do with employees that say, It\u2019s not fair. I don\u2019t have kids. This just benefits some people? You can also prevent backlash by making sure that processes are in place that allow all people to apply easily for flexible work arrangements or have access to the benefits. It is crucial that the process is consistently an fairly applied, clearly and well documented\u2026\nHow are demographic changes in Canada going to affect how organizations need to handle work-life? The aging workforce is going to force organizations to be more creative in phasing towards retirement. The nexus generation is coming into the workforce with very clear expectations of what they want from employers and clear expectations that they will be able to have meaningful work for meaningful wage without sacrificing work-life balance\u2026.there is a serious labour shortage in this country\u2026.employers are going to have to accommodate employees\u2019 demands in order to attract and retain valuable employees.\n[295] This Tribunal found the content of this Work\/Life Balance FAQs dated 2005-02-03, particularly consistent with the earlier testimony and report of Dr. Linda Duxbury.\n[296] Although Mr. Sheridan held the same post in 2003 under the CBSA\u2019s predecessor as he does now, he stated that he was completely unaware of the December 10, 2003 Equity Compliance Review directives and completely unaware of the Draft Accommodation Policy dated June 2007.\n[297] Mr. Sheridan was asked how it could be that he would be unaware of these documents. Mr. Sheridan noted that the Compliance Review is dated two days prior to the creation of CBSA, and stated that although some policies came over from CCRA to CBSA, he is unaware if any policies relating to the Equity Compliance Review that came over. There was no one called as part of the CBSA\u2019s case to explain who was in charge of receiving this Equity Compliance Review or how it was dealt with in the transition from CCRA to CBSA.\n[298] As to the Draft Accommodation Policy, he testified that he was not consulted about it and normally the drafters would consult with managers. As there are 190 Directors in CBSA, such a Draft would only go to some. This Tribunal notes that Mr. Darren Millet, by Mr. Star\u2019s testimony, was aware of it, but not Mr. Sheridan who is his superior. Also, Mr. John King, then President of the Union took a copy of it from a meeting he attended, and yet Mr. Sheridan was neither consulted nor had he seen it previously.\n[299] There was no one called as part of the CBSA\u2019s case to explain what happened to this Draft Policy after it was circulated, why it was written in the first place, why the Director of Operation for PIA would not have been made privy to it, or why is was not adopted after its creation. There was no evidence of any decisions taken not to adopt the Draft Policy for reasons of undue hardship, for example.\n[300] When asked about Dr. Moore-Ede\u2019s expert report tendered on behalf of CBSA, Mr. Sheridan stated that he wholly adopted its conclusion.\n[301] Mr. Sheridan testified that if Ms. Johnstone was accommodated for childcare responsibilities that he believes management would be inundated with such requests, the costs would be prohibitive, and it would be destructive to PIA operations that require that most employees work the VSSA schedule.\n[302] Although Mr. Sheridan testified that there were not that many accommodation requests made on the basis of childcare responsibilities, he has formed this opinion of the negative impact accommodation would have based on impressionistic reasons only. CBSA produced no studies or inquiries of any kind on the issue of undue hardship in terms of cost, morale, or operational failure. Impressionistic reasons are not sufficient to prove a BFOR.\n[303] The only evidence produced at this hearing to bolster CBSA\u2019s position that undue hardship would result is the expert report and testimony of Dr. Moore-Ede that was only produced for purposes of this hearing within the few months previous. In fact, when asked why Dr. Moore-Ede had not surveyed actual employees of PIA he replied that there had not been enough time. This is 5 years post-complaint.\n[304] Mr. Sheridan testified that the turnover rate of PIA employees is significant and a matter of concern for management, however, there seemed to be no acknowledgement that greater accommodation and shift flexibility might alleviate some of this problem.\nB. Evidence of Rhonda Raby [305] Having been told that she would not be granted full-time hours, in December 2003 Ms Johnstone wrote an e-mail trying to establish her new schedule to Rhonda Raby who then held the position of acting Chief of Terminal 1 at PIA Passenger Operations.\n[306] This Tribunal accepts Ms. Johnstone\u2019s evidence that her husband had approached Ms. Raby on Ms. Johnstone\u2019s behalf in the Fall of that year. Ms. Raby told him that she would not approve shifts for Ms. Johnstone of greater than 10 hours.\n[307] Accordingly, Ms. Johnstone asked to work Fridays, Sundays and Mondays from 11:00 am to 9:30 pm each day. Ms. Raby accepted this proposal.\n[308] Ms. Raby testified that there was no communication with her from Ms. Gerstl as to Ms. Johnstone\u2019s initial request, and Ms. Raby confirmed that she and Ms. Johnstone never discussed it directly either. Hence, Ms. Raby was unaware of Ms. Johnstone\u2019s initial request to Ms. Gerstl, but this Tribunal does not find that anything turns on this. Ms. Raby followed the unwritten policy of CBSA in dealing with Ms. Johnstone, and her approach would not have been any different if she had known of Ms. Johnstone\u2019s earlier request.\n[309] During her testimony, Ms. Raby seemed to have little knowledge of human rights legislative requirements despite her management position.\n[310] This Tribunal also found it notable that Ms. Raby stated that even though she was a Chief of Terminal 1 operations from 2002 to 2008, and saw her staff levels double and traffic double after the closure Terminal 2 in 2006, she could not recall anyone else asking for full-time work on return from maternity leave. She testified that often people want to work part-time on return from maternity leave.\n[311] Also, during those years, average accommodations per terminal (encompassing all requests for medical, educational, religious and family responsibilities) over three terminals was 15 people at any given time, or 45 for the whole operation (average to low estimate). This Tribunal finds this to be a very manageable level.\n[312] During Ms. Raby\u2019s evidence, she kept alluding to SOP or Standard Operating Procedures, unwritten, which speak to the part-time mandatory hours being developed because otherwise management would have been inundated with requests. To avoid this, she testified that management deliberately capped the hours at 34 hours to make part-time less desirable, i.e. workers wanting to be accommodated are discouraged from those requests.\n[313] Ms. Raby did not seem to see the irony in her remarks. Management has capped part-time at 34 hours to make it less desirable, and yet management forces the 34 hour cap on employees like Ms. Johnstone who want to work full-time but need accommodation to do it.\n[314] Ms. Raby testified that at the time of at least Fiona Johnstone\u2019s initial request there was a Chief of Operations for Terminals 1,2, and 3. There was also Director overseeing Gateway (Mr. Sheridan). The Chiefs consulted on accommodation requests (all of them, for whatever reason) among themselves, but they did not consult at the time with the Gateway Director.\n[315] There were a lot of questions asked during the hearing as to why Ms. Johnstone couldn\u2019t have been accommodated by giving her 12.5 hours shifts at Gateway where such shifts exist, and one of CBSA\u2019s excuses of the high-stress work environment does not exist. Ms. Raby testified that because they weren\u2019t talking to each other, this was an option that was never considered nor suggested to Ms. Johnstone. Ms. Raby stated that none of the separate districts within PIA communicated on accommodation requests.\n[316] Ms. Raby confirmed that CBSA management treats medical accommodations differently because CBSA acts in accordance with the medical evidence, i.e. doctor validation, that accommodation is necessary for reasons of health, safety concerns and liability.\n[317] Ms. Raby confirmed that not accommodated employees are part-time, but often in the CBSA witnesses\u2019 testimonies there was confusion between those being accommodated and the termpart-time.\n[318] Mr. Star was an example of an accommodated employee who was not part-time. He has been accommodated on an on-going permanent basis for religious observance.\n[319] Most people seeking religious accommodation do not need it on a continuing basis for each shift period, e.g. Christians who do not want to work on Christmas Eve or Easter Sunday, or Muslims who may want to take a several day pilgrimage to Mecca, or need short periods off for prayer. Therefore, these people are accommodated for a short time, from time to time, but are still full-time employees.\n[320] Medical accommodation, of course, depends on the medical issue and can require very short-term to longer term accommodation, depending on what the doctor feels the worker can do. This can affect how many days or what hours or what duties a person needs to be relieved from. Not all of these accommodations are part-time either.\n[321] Ms. Raby confirmed Mr. Sheridan\u2019s testimony that the term accommodation was used at CBSA to mean all adjustments off VSSA. It can be confusing, so Management started differentiating by using the terms accommodation for medical reasons, and arrangement for other requests. Such arrangements include educational requests where people want changes to return to school, etc.\n[322] It was apparent that Ms. Raby had never received anything other than the most cursory human rights training in terms of understanding there was a duty to accommodate those with medical reasons. She was aware that there were other enumerated grounds in the Act.\n[323] Ms. Raby\u2019s testimony revealed that CBSA efforts, if any, have been totally inadequate in terms of training even management on human rights issues, obligations, duties, or processes.\n[324] CBSA\u2019s approach upon receipt of accommodation requests has been to only do sufficient inquiry or background questioning to establish the bona fides of the request, its legitimacy. No effort is put into actually trying to meet the accommodation request, or to determine what the actual impact or cost be would be. This is all driven by a pervasive belief at the management level that too many people would want to be accommodated off VSSA\u2019 which would be operationally far too difficult. According to Ms. Raby, this is the issue and not cost.\n[325] Asked if she had any complaints from other employees about people getting shift changes due to medical accommodation, Ms. Raby said, yes. Asked further, she remembers receiving one e-mail, and bases her belief that there is a morale issue around medical accommodation on what she hears around the workplace.\n[326] Although she was a Chief of Operations and had the mandate during the relevant years to deal with and decide upon accommodation requests, Ms. Raby testified that she kept no ongoing log to identify people being accommodated, and kept requests for full-time static shift work only in an e-mail file.\n[327] Ms. Raby further testified that if an opening came along in an area that an employee had expressed a desire to work in, she would not cross-reference particularly or ever. In other words, although she had denied Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request, if an opportunity had come up to meet her request in an area in which she had expressed an interest, Ms. Raby would make no attempt to put that opportunity together and communicate it to Ms. Johnstone.\n[328] When new job opportunities arise, a Call Letter goes out, which you do not receive if you are off the job site on maternity leave. Depending on who responds, then management looks back at preferential listings on a worker\u2019s annual performance review assessments. They do not catalogue or look through the preferences listed, and do not keep that data anywhere. There are also internet and intranet postings, but employees on maternity leave would not receive intranet postings, and would be unaware of those.\n[329] Given Ms. Raby\u2019s testimony on these various issues, it seemed evident to this Tribunal that CBSA management does not see its role as working cooperatively with its BSO employees, and yet when it comes to human rights accommodation requests that is exactly what the jurisprudence calls upon an employer and employee to do.\nC. Evidence of Expert, Dr. Moore-Ede [330] Dr. Moore-Ede was qualified as an expert in the study of shift work and extended working hours including staffing level analyses, shift scheduling optimization, shift work lifestyle training, and cost-benefit analyses with respect to employer policies pertaining to the management of shift workers, including all relevant factors that relate to the development of shift schedules.\n[331] Dr. Moore-Ede founded Circadian in 1983, an international research and consulting firm specializing in how to manage the challenge of employing workers in a 24\/7 environment.\n[332] His database indicated that approximately 52% of all shift workers have childcare needs and 60% of these, or 31% of all shift workers use childcare other than their spouse or partner. However, he also referred to studies which have found that shift workers are more likely to arrange or rely on care by spouses, relatives and friends, as opposed to third party caregivers.\n[333] This Tribunal finds that there were several serious flaws in this report. The whole basis of the data that leads Dr. Moore-Ede to the conclusion that between 31% to 52% of CBSA workers will seek the same accommodation as Ms. Johnstone, comes from answers by 32,000 shift workers to question #13 of his Circadian questionnaire found at Addendum C of his exhibited written report.\n[334] The sampling respondents are made up of workers from the US and Canada, but the Canadian percentage is very small. There was no questionnaire or surveying done of CBSA workers as Dr. Moore-Ede said that CBSA had not given him enough lead time nor paid him sufficiently to undertake that sort of exercise.\n[335] The one question relied upon, question # 13, reads:\n(a) What primary childcare arrangements do you currently have?\nChild care provider Relatives Spouse or partner Other does not apply (no children at home)\n[336] This question does not address subsets such as children of pre-school age as opposed to children and teenagers still at home.\n[337] Also, when Dr. Moore-Ede used the numbers to extrapolate, he didn\u2019t just extrapolate from those who said they used third party childcare providers, but from all respondents who had children at home regardless of whether they had indicated care was provided by spouse, family, third parties or other. There is no indication that all parents would seek accommodation regardless of the age of their children and regardless of the childcare arrangements they have arranged.\n[338] Additionally, Dr. Moore-Ede had no overlay of data related to workers who work rotating shifts, with their partners\/spouses also working rotating shifts. Other provided evidence indicates this situation would only apply to 1.2% of the shift worker population.\n[339] Dr. Moore-Ede\u2019s conclusions were premised on the belief that there would be a ripple effect from accommodating Ms. Johnstone\u2019s request driven by the dissatisfaction of non-accommodated workers being necessarily shoved into less desirable shifts and times.\n[340] Dr. Moore-Ede testified that the above scenario would lead to dishonesty and people playing games where they would create childcare accommodation scenarios to meet the requirements in order to get preferable shift days and times.\n[341] Obviously, a 24\/7 rotating shift scheduled operation could not afford to have one-half of its workforce working off the VSSA. However, this speculation by Dr. Moore-Ed is not borne out by the actual experiences to date of even the CBSA\u2019s own witnesses in management. The numbers that Dr. Moore-Ede put forward are not realistic, and founded in either inadequate details in the question relied upon for the numbers to be valid, or unproven assumptions that are a discredit to the ethics and motivations of the subject workforce.\n[342] Dr. Moore-Ede did not address the effect of employee education as a key component. There is no substantive evidence before this Tribunal that this particular workforce cannot be educated as to the human rights law basis for certain accommodation requests being acceded to.\n[343] It is notable that this was a temporary accommodation being sought during Ms. Johnstone\u2019s children\u2019s pre-school years. She intends to return to full-time work in 2010. This is not a permanent accommodation request as one would see in a religious accommodation, nor a long-term disability situation.\n[344] Dr. Moore-Ede took no exception to Ms. Johnstone\u2019s experts\u2019 reports regarding lack of availability of third-party child care, and generally agreed with those conclusions.\n[345] Dr. Moore-Ede conceded that he had not taken into account the offset saving of costs that occur with accommodation in terms of reduced absenteeism, sick days, leave requests, etc. when accommodated workers are more satisfied with a workplace that meets, or endeavors to meet, their temporary needs.\n[346] Dr. Moore-Ede also conceded that he had not taken into account the difference between Canada and the U.S. in terms of the Canadian government offering a wider safety net to young parents with the availability of one year maternity and parental leave \u2013 something not offered in the U.S. So, whereas in the U.S. parents may be faced with finding daycare when a child is just 2 months old, in Canada this usually does not arise until the child is 1 year old. This reduces the overall need for alternative care to ages 1 -5, as opposed to newborn to 5.\n[347] Further, Dr. Moore-Ede assumes that employees with childcare responsibilities would request day shifts, i.e. childcare friendly hours. He assumes from there that this would have a negative impact in terms of health and safety on non-accommodated employees. This is contrary to other evidence before this Tribunal. Ms. Johnstone in her own request did not request day shifts. She suggested afternoon shifts.\nVII. Conclusion\/Analysis [348] In Meiorin the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that the duty of employers to accommodate is a fundamental legal obligation. An employer must demonstrate that the discrimination is necessary to achieve legitimate work-related objectives and tender affirmative evidence that the point of undue hardship has been reach in its efforts to accommodate the employee.\n[349] Also in Meiorin, the Supreme Court of Canada stated that [u]nless no further accommodation is possible without imposing undue hardship, the standard is not a BFOR in its existing form and the prima facie case of discrimination stands.\n[350] In Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail Canada Inc., [2007] S.C.J. No. 15 (Via Rail) the Supreme Court of Canada stated that undue hardship is reached when reasonable measures of accommodation are exhausted and only unreasonable or impracticable options for accommodation remain.\n[351] These cases very apparently set out a duty on the part of CBSA to make a real effort to accommodate, an effort that is tangible and measurable, and tests out the employer\u2019s ability to meet the accommodation request. CBSA must not base its assessment of whether an employee needs accommodation, or of whether it can implement accommodation measures, based on impressionistic assumptions.\n[352] It is a clear directive to employers to make all reasonable efforts and afford employees all reasonable opportunities, not to fall back on impressionistic views standing behind unwritten policies brought into practice for unrelated reasons.\n[353] In British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer) the Supreme Court of Canada stated that, \u2026impressionistic evidence of increased expense will not generally suffice.\n[354] Generally, undue hardship means disproportionate, improper, inordinate, excessive or oppressive\u2026 (Via Rail)\n[355] In that her performance appraisals were universally sound, and she had testified to often working long shifts extended due to overtime requirements, this Tribunal accepts that there are no viable health and safety concerns about Ms. Johnstone performing 13 hour shifts.\n[356] It is telling that despite Dr. Moore-Ede\u2019s numerical extrapolation that would see half of the CBSA employees at PIA seeking family status accommodation, Ms. Raby could not recall another request between 2002 and the hearing, and Mr. Sheridan could think of only one instance. This testimony as to management\u2019s actual experience with this specific workforce weighs heavily against Dr. Moore-Ede\u2019s theory.\n[357] Other than Dr. Moore-Ede\u2019s report of 2009, no analysis has been done, no scientific study undertaken, no consultants brought in to look at accommodation issues, no policies put in place since either the Brown decision of 1993, or the CHRC direction 10 years later that policies should be developed.\n[358] This Tribunal finds that CBSA has not established a BFOR defence, nor developed a sufficient undue hardship argument to discharge the onus upon it. CBSA did not assess whether it could accommodate Ms. Johnstone\u2019s family responsibilities. The Tribunal therefore finds that CBSA failed to establish that it could not accommodate Ms. Johnstone to the point of undue hardship.\n[359] This Tribunal confirmed with witnesses called by both the Complainant and the Respondent, as well as Respondent\u2019s counsel, that none of the Draft Policy to Accommodate\u2019s proposals, including the creation of a National Job Accommodation Fund, were ever put into action. The Respondent\u2019s position throughout the hearing was that childcare responsibilities under any circumstances do not trigger a duty to accommodate under the family status discrimination grounds of the Act. The Respondent therefore has no written policies on accommodation under this provision of the Act, and its unwritten policies are as set out above: CBSA allows an employee requesting static shifts for childcare responsibility reasons, to have static shifts off the VSSA, but mandates that such employee only work up to 34 hours per week on part-time status.\n[360] The importance of setting out the history in Part III of this decision is to allow an understanding that over an approximate 25 year period, the CHRT, the CHRC, and mechanisms within the federal government public service (some internal to the Respondent itself), have recognized a need to address work-life balance issues that naturally arise for some employees who are parents and have childcare obligations that are not compatible with the regularly scheduled shifts set up by the VSSA or like regimes. Such childcare obligations have been recognized elsewhere, as set out, under the family status ground enumerated in the Act.\n[361] On the whole of the evidence, and by the admission of the Respondent\u2019s witnesses in senior management, there have been no attempts to raise awareness of human rights legislation pertaining to family status among either management or employees, nor manage any perceived or actual resistance among those in the workforce who may not directly benefit from accommodation measures at any given time. The evidence of the Respondent\u2019s management witnesses showed a very cursory, nominal understanding of human rights legislation and no training or awareness of the details of the decision in Brown, or the CHRC audit referred to earlier, in their identification of childcare and child rearing as an identifier that warrants accommodation under the Act.\n[362] The Respondent has not undertaken any detailed look at bona fide operational requirements and options short of undue hardship. The evidence as a whole strongly indicates that the Respondent has not taken these steps because it has not recognized the necessity of doing so. In other words, if the Respondent\u2019s position is correct that child-rearing obligations for young children does not fall within the meaning of family status\u2019 in the Act, there is no reason to do anything. The expert evidence of Dr. Moore-Ede presented through this hearing was the first study of any kind undertaken on behalf of the Respondent to justify or explain its position.\n[363] During the time period spanned by the evidence presented in this hearing, the Respondent could have easily created written, transparent and fair policies that are uniformly applied and demonstrate a real commitment to and understanding of human rights legislation under the enumerated ground of family status. At the same time, the Respondent could have dealt openly with unique cases as they arise which the Respondent admits it has not done, within already existing mechanisms. It is admitted by the Respondent\u2019s management witnesses, that these mechanisms instead are reserved for those seeking medical and religious accommodations only, with random exceptions.\n[364] Having found that Ms. Johnstone\u2019s complaint is substantiated and that she has been discriminated against on the grounds of family status, it is important that she benefit from an individualized assessment of her accommodation needs.\nVIII. Decision [365] For the reasons that follow, this Tribunal finds that Ms. Johnstone\u2019s complaint is substantiated:\nMs. Johnstone has made out a prima facie case of adverse differentiation against CBSA within the meaning of section 7 of the Act, on the basis of family status; Ms. Johnstone has demonstrated, on a prima facie basis, that the CBSA established and pursued policies and practices that deprived or tended to deprive the Complainant and any similar class of individuals of employment opportunities, on the ground of family status, within the meaning of Section 10 of the Act; CBSA has failed to establish a bona fide occupational requirement, present a reasonable explanation for, or otherwise justify the case of prima facie discrimination against it.\nIX. Remedy A. Systemic Remedy [366] This Tribunal orders the Respondent to cease its discriminatory practices against employees who seek accommodation based on family status for purposes of childcare responsibilities, and to consult with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, in accordance with the provisions of Section 53 (2) (a) of the Act, to develop a plan to prevent further incidents of discrimination based on family status in the future.\n[367] In order that Ms. Johnstone and other employees in her like situation not be deprived of future employment opportunities, wages and benefits, this Tribunal further orders that CBSA establish written policies satisfactory to Ms. Johnstone and the CHRC to address family status accommodation requests within 6 months, and that these policies include a process for individualized assessments of those making such requests.\n[368] Ms. Johnstone seeks reimbursement for all lost wages and benefits, including overtime that she would have received and pension contributions that would have been made on a full-time basis but for the fact that she was a part-time employee. She also seeks an Order directing that she be entitled to effect pension contributions as a full-time employee subsequent to August 2007.\n[369] Ms. Johnstone commenced part-time employment on January 4, 2004. Thereafter, other than her time on her second maternity leave from December 24, 2004 through to December 26, 2005, she worked part-time hours. During the time she worked part-time hours, the evidence is that her wages and benefits were all pro-rated. Her wages and benefits were also pro-rated at the part-time rate while she was on maternity leave.\n[370] Between August 14, 2007 through to August 2008, Ms. Johnstone was on Leave Without Pay for Spousal Relocation due to her husband being transferred to Ottawa. This ended in August 2008. During this Leave, Ms. Johnstone has been entitled to make pension contributions at a pro-rated rate of 20 hours per week.\n[371] Since August 2008, Ms. Johnstone she has been on Care and Nurturing Leave (unpaid) as allowed under the Collective Agreement.\n[372] Ms. Johnstone was clear in her evidence that she made choices regarding the number of hours she would work because of CBSA\u2019s refusal to allow her to work full-time hours with consequent loss of full-time wages, benefits and opportunities. Her statement that she would have made it work had she been granted full-time shifts after the birth of her second child, was uncontroverted.\n[373] Ms. Johnstone further testified (see para. 106 above) that she would have continued to work full-time despite her husband\u2019s relocation.\n[374] At the hearing counsel for the parties seemed confident that they could reach agreement on the quantum to which Ms. Johnstone would be entitled should this Tribunal order that she receive compensation under this heading.\n[375] Accordingly, this Tribunal orders that Ms. Johnstone be compensated for her lost wages and benefits, including overtime that she would have received and pension contributions that would have been made had she been able to work on a full-time basis from January 4, 2004 to the present. This Order includes a direction that Ms. Johnstone be entitled to effect pension contributions as a full-time employee during this relevant period. Ms. Johnstone is not entitled to lost wages due to attendance at this hearing.\nB. General Damages for Pain and Suffering [376] It was evident in Ms. Johnstone\u2019s testimony that she suffered injury to her person, her personal and professional confidence, and her professional reputation resulting from the discrimination that gave rise to this complaint.\n[377] Ms. Johnstone testified that she was embarrassed by reference to her as the human rights case, and that she was upset by the arbitrary way in which she was dealt with despite her best efforts to try to find a way to create a workable balance between a job that she stated she truly enjoyed and her young children.\n[378] I award Ms Johnstone $15,000.00 under this heading pursuant to Section 53 (2) (e) of the Act.\nC. Special Compensation [379] Section 53 (3) of the Act provides for awards of Special Compensation for willful and reckless conduct, to a maximum of $20,000.00. Although heard before the 1998 Act amendments when the quantum allowed for damages under the headings of pain and suffering and special compensation were lower, this Tribunal is still guided by the reasonableness of Martin that followed the reasoning in Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02 and Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan, [1991] 2 F.C. 401 (F.C.A.), that the maximum award should be reserved for the very worst cases.\n[380] This Tribunal finds that CBSA, by ignoring so many efforts both externally and internally to bring about change with respect to its family status policies of accommodation has deliberately denied protection to those in need of it.\n[381] CBSA, and its organizational predecessor\u2019s lack of effort and lack of concern takes many forms over many years including: disregard for the Brown decision after writing a letter of apology; developing a model policy and then burying it (some management knew of it, some did not); pursuing arbitrary policies that are unwritten and not universally followed; lack of human rights awareness training even at the senior management level; the proffering of a floodgates argument 5 years after the complaint with the Respondent giving insufficient time and data to its own expert to enable him to provide a helpful expert opinion; and no attempt to inquire of Ms. Johnstone as to her particular circumstances or inform her of options to meet her needs.\n[382] Given all the circumstances of this case, this Tribunal awards Ms. Johnstone $20,000.00 under this heading. CBSA\u2019s conduct has been willful and reckless, showing a disregard for Ms. Johnstone\u2019s situation and denying that a duty to accommodate exists on grounds of family status arising for childcare responsibilities such as hers.\nD. Interest [383] Pursuant to Section 53(4) of the Act, this Tribunal orders that compound interest at the Canada Savings Bond rate be paid on any and all amounts awarded pursuant to this decision under the headings of General Damages for Pain and Suffering pursuant to Section 53(2)(e) of the Act, and Special Compensation pursuant to Section 53(3) of the Act.\nE. Solicitor Client Costs [384] Ms. Johnstone was represented by senior legal counsel, experienced in matters of human rights law and the organizational structures of the federal public service. Ms. Johnstone\u2019s counsel\u2019s expertise allowed her to present a thorough Complainant\u2019s case before the Tribunal and was an integral part of her ultimate success. Due to the conflicting nature of past court decisions and adjudications on the enumerated ground of family status in the Act, and the unique and complex nature of CBSA operations, it would have been difficult for an unrepresented person to present this case.\n[385] However, by a decision rendered October 26, 2009, the Federal Court of Appeal has found that the CHRT cannot compensate victims of discrimination for legal costs under Section 53 (2)(c) of the Act. [Canada (A.G.) v. Mowat 2009 FCA 309]. The Federal Court of Appeal found that Section 53 does not convey express statutory jurisdiction to award compensation under this heading.\n[386] At paragraphs 101 and 102 of the decision, Justice Layden-Stevenson, with the concurrence of Justices Letourneau and Sexton found as follows:\n[101] These are issues that require the consideration of Parliament, for example, the desirability of empowering the Tribunal to award costs and, if desirable, the manner and the limits in which it should be accomplished. The role of Commission counsel may be a factor for contemplation as its role in the adjudicative process has changed significantly over the years. For many years, Commission counsel appeared at most Tribunal hearings, but that practice appears to have changed. The former procedure may have impacted Parliament\u2019s decision regarding the propriety of costs awards in human rights proceedings. Counsel advised that in 2003 the Commission revisited its interpretation of its role under section 51 of the Act. Finally, if authority to award costs is to be granted to the Tribunal, the nature of the costs regime must be determined. There are a number of potential permutations. [102] The ultimate decision and the policy choices inherent in making it are for Parliament, not the Tribunal or the court.\n[387] Accordingly, there is no award to the Complainant under this heading.\nF. Retention of Jurisdiction [388] This Tribunal will retain jurisdiction for six months after the filing of this Decision, in the event that the parties are unable to reach agreement on quantum under this heading or cannot agree with respect to the implementation of any of the remedies awarded. Should an extension of this time be required, submissions may be made as to the necessity for an extension.\nSigned by\nKerry-Lynne D. Findlay, Q.C.

WHAT FACTS DOES MS. KHALIFA ALLEGE IN HER COMPLAINT?\nII. WHAT IS THE LAW REGARDING MS. KHALIFA'S CLAIM OF DISCRIMINATION WITH RESPECT TO HER DISMISSAL?\nA. Has Ms. Khalifa established a prima facie case that IOGC committed a discriminatory practice pursuant to s. 7 of the CHRA, in terminating her employment on August 2, 2005?\nB. Has IOGC provided a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour?\n(i) What were Ms. Khalifa's alleged shortcomings regarding her attendance and punctuality?\n(ii) What were the indicators of Ms. Khalifa's declining work performance?\n(iii) How did Ms. Khalifa develop a tense relationship with, and show disrespect towards, Ms. Murphy?\n(iv) What is IOGC's explanation regarding the termination of Ms. Khalifa's contract?\n(v) Did Mr. Currie and Ms. Murphy discuss Ms. Khalifa's family status with her and was it a factor in their conduct and decisions regarding her?\n(vi) Is IOGC's explanation reasonable or just a pretext for otherwise discriminatory practices?\nIII. WHAT IS THE LAW REGARDING MS. KHALIFA'S CLAIM OF HARASSMENT?\nA. Has Ms. Khalifa established all of the conditions needed to make out a case of harassment?\n[1] Melissa Khalifa alleges that due to her family status as a single mother of four children, Indian Oil and Gas Canada (IOGC) treated her differently in the course of her employment, and ultimately terminated her. She also alleges that she was harassed during her employment on the same discriminatory basis.\n[2] In the decision that follows, I initially set out the facts as alleged and presented by Ms. Khalifa and find that she established a prima facie case that her termination was discriminatory under s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA). I then deal with IOGC's explanation, which I determine to be reasonable and not pretextual. Finally, I address Ms. Khalifa's harassment complaint, under s. 14 of the CHRA, and find that the incidents she raises do not constitute harassment within the meaning of the CHRA.\nI. What facts does Ms. Khalifa allege in her complaint? [3] IOGC manages and administers oil and gas resources that are found on Indian reserve lands. It is a special agency within the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. Ms. Khalifa worked in various capacities at IOGC's offices south of Calgary, from October 25, 2002, until August 2, 2005. Throughout this period, however, she was never formally an employee of IOGC, but rather an employee of a staffing agency named Spirit Staffing and Consulting Inc. (Spirit Staffing).\n[4] IOGC informed the Tribunal at the hearing that it was not claiming that Ms. Khalifa's employment arrangement ousted the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear the complaint. I understand IOGC's position to therefore mean that it accepts Ms. Khalifa's relationship with IOGC as constituting employment within the meaning of ss. 7 and 14.\n[5] Spirit Staffing had a standing offer with Public Works and Government Services Canada to provide temporary help services to the Government of Canada. Accordingly, government agencies, such as IOGC, had the authority to call-up temporary help services from Spirit Staffing on an as-needed basis.\n[6] Ms. Khalifa's first assignment at IOGC was as a receptionist within IOGC's Professional and Corporate Services Division. IOGC renewed her initial call-up and she was eventually asked to replace the Production Division's administration officer, who had transferred to another job. The Production Division was headed by the General Manager of Production, Bill Currie.\n[7] In 2004, Mr. Currie was named Acting Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of IOGC, a position that came within the agency's Executive Division. The CEO position was already staffed with an administration officer. According to Ms. Khalifa, Mr. Currie nevertheless had [her] moved over, on October 12, 2004, to the Executive Division, to work under the supervision of another manager. She was assigned tasks relating to communications, the production of annual reports as well as any other sundry tasks that Mr. Currie also may have asked of her.\n[8] Early in 2005, Mr. Currie returned to his position as General Manager of Production. In February 2005, he interviewed and hired, as a full-time IOGC employee, his new administration officer, Laurie Murphy. Ms. Khalifa testified that although Mr. Currie now had a full-time administration officer in the Production Division, he nonetheless again arranged to have Ms. Khalifa return to work for him in the division as well, commencing April 1, 2005. This contract or call-up was scheduled to end on August 19, 2005. Her designated supervisor, according to the contract, was Ms. Murphy.\n[9] Ms. Khalifa testified that she questioned at the time whether her services were needed in the division, given the tasks that Ms. Murphy was already performing, but Mr. Currie advised Ms. Khalifa to continue working under the new call-up just the same. She took his advice and was pleased to discover that she was being assigned projects she enjoyed doing. Furthermore, aside from her Production Division tasks, Ms. Khalifa was also being given overtime work from the Executive and Land Divisions, which she found very satisfying as well.\n[10] In contrast, Ms. Khalifa claims to have observed, by the end of April 2005, that Ms. Murphy was unhappy in her position and the rather mundane administrative tasks she was being assigned, such as making travel arrangements for Mr. Currie. According to Ms. Khalifa, Ms. Murphy was envious of the tasks being given to Ms. Khalifa, and began expressing her disgruntlement through discriminatory statements directed at Ms. Khalifa, relating to her family status. Ms. Khalifa was a single parent of four children, three of whom were minors at the time. Issues relating to their schooling or health would occasionally arise, resulting in her having to be absent from work. In addition, one of her children had a learning disability, which required that she sometimes take him to appointments with various specialists.\n[11] One day in late April 2005, Ms. Khalifa was called away from work to take care of a matter at school regarding one of her children. She testified that when she subsequently informed Ms. Murphy (whose office was in the cubicle adjoining hers) about this situation, Ms. Murphy responded by telling her that as a single parent, she should consider looking for work elsewhere, in a place that is better suited for a single parent.\n[12] Ms. Khalifa claims that she was so shocked by this comment that she immediately rose from her work desk and walked over to the office of Darryl Jaques, who was a senior engineer with IOGC. His office was situated across the hall from hers. Ms. Khalifa closed the door and told him, Would you believe what Laurie Murphy just said to me?, and recounted to him Ms. Murphy's statement. Ms. Khalifa testified that Mr. Jaques suggested she take her concerns directly to Mr. Currie.\n[13] Ms. Khalifa called Mr. Jaques as a witness at the hearing into her complaint. He recalled Ms. Khalifa complaining about the hard times she was having with Ms. Murphy as her supervisor, but did not recall her having mentioned any remark by Ms. Murphy relating to Ms. Khalifa's single parent status.\n[14] Ms. Khalifa testified that a day or two later, she spoke to Mr. Currie about Ms. Murphy's remarks and was flabbergasted by his response. She claims that Mr. Currie suggested to her that perhaps Ms. Murphy was looking out for Ms. Khalifa's best interests and that looking for a job elsewhere may be more suitable to her family situation. Ms. Khalifa was also unhappy to hear Mr. Currie then ask her what kind of child care arrangements she had planned for the upcoming summer. She explained to him that she was extending her existing afterschool child care to the full day. She testified that she was unhappy that Mr. Currie did not satisfactorily address her objections to Ms. Murphy's remarks during the meeting.\n[15] Ms. Khalifa contends that after her discussion with Mr. Currie, she began to get a sense of the tone and direction of his attitude with respect to her family status. She was surprised by this as there was never any concern expressed about her being a single parent prior to Ms. Murphy's comment.\n[16] In the months following Ms. Murphy's comment, Ms. Khalifa observed that when she would bring up some activity regarding her children, Ms. Murphy would breathe a heavy sigh or roll her eyes. In June, 2005, after one of those sighs, Ms. Khalifa challenged Ms. Murphy. She pointed out that Ms. Murphy also had a child and asked why her situation should be treated any differently. Ms. Murphy allegedly replied that in her own case, it was acceptable for her to work because she had a husband's support, whereas Ms. Khalifa did not.\n[17] Ms. Khalifa indicated in her testimony that on another occasion, Mr. Currie invited her into his office, though her evidence regarding this meeting was not very clear. She seemed to suggest that Mr. Currie asked her personal questions on this occasion, including where she was living, and commented that he knew how hard it was to be a single parent.\n[18] After this conversation, Ms. Khalifa apparently met with Susan McCurdie, who was IOGC's human resources advisor. Ms. Khalifa was not always certain in her testimony about the sequence of events, so it may well be that this meeting took place prior to this last-mentioned conversation with Mr. Currie. Ms. McCurdie's responsibilities included dealing with human rights and harassment issues arising at IOGC. Ms. Khalifa told her about the comments and questioning she had been getting from Mr. Currie and Ms. Murphy, and asked to file a harassment complaint. Ms. McCurdie told her that she could not accept a complaint from her because she was not an IOGC employee, but rather a temporary staff person employed by Spirit Staffing. Ms. McCurdie nonetheless listened to the details provided by Ms. Khalifa. According to Ms. Khalifa, Ms. McCurdie replied that Mr. Currie, as a manager, should have known that it is a big no-no to allow the kind of comments being made by Ms. Murphy and to be raising the types of personal questions that he had been asking Ms. Khalifa.\n[19] Ms. McCurdie also suggested that if Mr. Currie were to pose such questions again, Ms. Khalifa should tell him that she is uncomfortable answering and that he should refrain from asking them. On Ms. McCurdie's suggestion, Ms. Khalifa also spoke to Bryan Potter, who was IOGC's manager of contracts and administration, and therefore responsible for the contracting of temporary staff like Ms. Khalifa. Mr. Potter concurred that Ms. McCurdie was not authorized to receive a harassment complaint from Ms. Khalifa. He suggested to Ms. Khalifa, however, that if she was having these difficulties with her supervisor, she could consider seeking work elsewhere within IOGC.\n[20] Ms. Khalifa testified that Ms. Murphy's attitude with respect to her family status became so upsetting that on July 22, 2005, she went to Mr. Currie in tears and told him she could no longer take the situation anymore and wanted to leave. The insinuations, comments and questioning about her children were getting to her. She began doubting whether indeed she could cope with working and being a single parent. It was becoming apparent to her that she could not perform properly because of her family needs and was feeling uncomfortable. However, she also testified that the source of her problems was Ms. Murphy's blowing things out of proportion with respect to her inability to meet her work requirements. Mr. Currie urged her during their meeting to be patient. He was leaving on vacation the next day but assured her that he would deal with her concerns upon his return.\n[21] On August 2, 2005, which was Mr. Currie's first day back at work after his vacation, he invited Ms. Khalifa into his office for a meeting. It was a short conversation. According to Ms. Khalifa, he told her that being a single parent interfered too much with her work and that her contract was therefore being terminated that day, seventeen days prior to the scheduled end of her call-up (August 19, 2005). She claims she was asked to pack up her stuff and leave. She testified that she then returned to her office cubicle in a state of shock. While she began to collect some of her belongings, she noticed Mr. Currie walking back and forth outside her cubicle, looking in. She found it difficult to stay any longer, so she left IOGC's offices with only a few of her things. She had intended to return and collect the rest of her items, but could not bring herself to do so, so she sent her daughter to pick them up instead.\n[22] Ms. Khalifa testified that her work performance at IOGC was always satisfactory or better. Mr. Jaques gave evidence at the hearing that there were no issues with her performance to his knowledge, having always found her helpful. He sometimes served as Acting General Manager of the Production Division, though he had little recollection at the hearing of having supervised her.\n[23] Mr. Potter, for his part, testified that Ms. Khalifa had worked within his division when she first came to IOGC as a receptionist. In his view, she had provided excellent service while employed in that position. Ms. McCurdie was Ms. Khalifa's supervisor for about eight of the weeks when Ms. Khalifa was employed at reception. Ms. McCurdie testified that she had no concerns with respect to Ms. Khalifa's performance, punctuality or attendance at the time.\n[24] Alexandra Steinke is a communications officer at IOGC who worked within the Executive Division at the same time as Ms. Khalifa. Ms. Steinke testified that Ms. Khalifa was able to deal with any task assigned to her and did a really good job. Ms. Steinke did not apprehend any attendance problems regarding Ms. Khalifa and, based on her perception, believed that Mr. Currie thought the world of Ms. Khalifa.\n[25] The owner of Spirit Staffing, Janice Larocque, also testified that IOGC had never complained to her about Ms. Khalifa's performance or attendance. She noted that according to Spirit Staffing's standing offer with the Government of Canada, a temporary staffer cannot be called up for a period in excess of six months. Ms. Khalifa worked at IOGC continuously for almost three years, on a series of different call-ups, which is the longest period that any of Spirit Staffing's employees has ever worked at one employer. Ms. Laroque surmised therefore that Ms. Khalifa's performance must have been good. Since June 2007, Ms. Khalifa has been working within Spirit Staffing's own offices as a receptionist as well as a recruiter. Ms. Laroque testified that Ms. Khalifa is one of the most dedicated employees the firm has ever had, often working overtime and through her lunch hour. There are no issues regarding her attendance or punctuality at work.\n[26] During the last call-up prior to the termination of her contract, Ms. Khalifa claims that the services she was providing greatly exceeded what was expected of her. She produced the timesheets that she was filing with Spirit Staffing indicating the numbers of hours worked. Spirit Staffing would pay her remuneration for the services rendered based on these timesheets. The timesheets indicate that during 13 of the 18 weeks that Ms. Khalifa worked in the Production Division in 2005, she also filed timesheets relating to overtime services provided to the Land, Executive and Communication Divisions, ranging in most weeks from 16 to 30 hours per week. This overtime work was in addition to the weekday work.\n[27] Ms. Khalifa testified that she had a reasonable expectation of continued employment at IOGC, beyond the expiry of the April to August 2005 call-up, having been told by a representative of the accounting section of the Professional and Corporate Services Division (whose name Ms. Khalifa does not recall) that her services had been budgeted for the remainder of the fiscal year, although the call-ups would still have to be renewed every 20 weeks.\n[28] Ms. Khalifa therefore submits that given her more than satisfactory work performance, the only conceivable explanation for the early termination of her call-up must be related to Mr. Currie's and Ms. Murphy's attitude with respect to her family status as a single mother of minor children. She also contends that their behaviour constituted harassment within the meaning of s. 14 of the CHRA. I will deal with each of these two alleged discriminatory practices separately.\nII. What is the law regarding Ms. Khalifa's claim of discrimination with respect to her dismissal? [29] It is a discriminatory practice under the CHRA to refuse to continue to employ a person on the basis of her family status (ss. 3 and 7(a)).\n[30] A complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., 1985 CanLII 18 (S.C.C.), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley)). A prima facie case, in this context, is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. Once the prima facie case is established, the onus then shifts to the respondent to disprove the allegations or provide some other reasonable explanation.\n[31] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the employer's decision (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para 7 (F.C.A.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, 1995 CanLII 3589 (F.C.), [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (T.D.)).\n[32] In Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 at para. 38481 (CHRT), the Tribunal stated that discrimination is not a practice that one would expect to see displayed overtly. A tribunal should therefore consider all circumstances to determine if there exists a subtle scent of discrimination.\nA. Has Ms. Khalifa established a prima facie case that IOGC committed a discriminatory practice pursuant to s. 7 of the CHRA, in terminating her employment on August 2, 2005? [33] I am satisfied that Ms. Khalifa has established a prima facie case that her termination was discriminatory. The evidence adduced by her, in support of her allegations, if believed, would be complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in her favour, absent an explanation from IOGC.\n[34] She was terminated 17 days prior to the scheduled end of her employment and she alleges that based on her more than satisfactory performance since joining IOGC, as well as the information she had received that her salary had been budgeted for until March 31, 2006, it was reasonable to expect that she would again be called up to work for IOGC after the expiration of the then current call-up.\n[35] She testified, in addition, that Mr. Currie openly stated, in their final meeting, that the reason for her termination was the impact her commitments as a single mother were having on her work. His comments were along the same lines as his remarks during their prior meetings, regarding the care of her children. Based on the foregoing, Ms. Khalifa's evidence, if believed, is sufficient to establish prima facie that her family status was a factor in the decision to pre-emptively terminate her contract.\nB. Has IOGC provided a reasonable explanation for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour? [36] IOGC contends that Ms. Khalifa's family status was never a factor in the termination of her contract. Rather, IOGC explains that her call-up was ended because of:\nher shortcomings with respect to punctuality and attendance, her declining work performance, and the tense relationship that developed with IOGC's permanent staff (namely her supervisor, Ms. Murphy) and the disrespect she showed towards her.\n[37] Mr. Currie testified with respect to Ms. Khalifa's April 1, 2005, call-up to work at the Production Division. Her previous call-up was to come to an end on March 31, 2005. He had no intention of using any temporary staff at the Production Division. He testified, however, that a number of people from the other divisions for whom Ms. Khalifa had been providing services wanted to continue using her temporary services but lacked room in their budgets to fund her continued employment. So these individuals asked Mr. Currie to call up Ms. Khalifa through his Production Division, which had a larger available budget than the other divisions, and effectively fund her activities through his budget. Mr. Currie, in fact, asserted in his evidence that but for his consenting to allocate his division's funds for the performance of work principally for other divisions, her call-up would not have been renewed and her services for IOGC would have ended on March 31, 2005.\n[38] Ms. Khalifa's new contract was prepared in writing and indicated that its term ran from April 1, 2005, until August 19, 2005, a total period of 20 weeks. Her rate of pay was shown to be $21.75 per hour, for a total of 37.5 hours per week. Mr. Currie testified that he had expectations that Ms. Khalifa would be able to complete the work for the Production and other divisions within the normal course of a business day, starting at a reasonable time of 8 to 9 o'clock. These expectations were conveyed to her along with an understanding that there would be some flexibility extended as to the start and end of the work day.\n[39] When Mr. Currie executed the call-up for Ms. Khalifa, he had concerns regarding his division's ability to monitor her time. He was worried that given his extensive duties as General Manager, he would be unable to supervise Ms. Khalifa sufficiently. Staff who had worked more closely with her in the past had advised Mr. Currie that they had had some difficulty monitoring her time and performance, and that her attendance and work habits were very fluid. He testified that this was the background information that he had regarding Ms. Khalifa's potential performance.\n[40] He acknowledged that when Ms. Khalifa had previously provided temporary services, he found her work performance satisfactory. He highlighted, however, that when he served as Acting CEO, he had a full-time administrative officer to handle any administrative tasks. So his interaction with additional staff, including Ms. Khalifa, was minimal during the period that preceded her call-up to the Production Division in April 2005.\n[41] Since Mr. Currie was too busy, as General Manager of Production, to monitor Ms. Khalifa's activities directly and keep track of her time, he assigned the task to Ms. Murphy. He met with her on April 11, 2005, and asked that she supervise Ms. Khalifa's hours of work and report to him on the status of her performance of assigned tasks. He explained to her that he had concerns about Ms. Khalifa's work schedule and hours of work. In an effort to ensure that the work was done according to the contract, Ms. Murphy was directed to monitor Ms. Khalifa's hours to ensure that she performed her work and to report back weekly to Mr. Currie on the status of Ms. Khalifa's work performance.\n(i) What were Ms. Khalifa's alleged shortcomings regarding her attendance and punctuality? [42] Ms. Murphy testified that early in her career, she had established a practice of always maintaining a diary in which she would jot down activities from her personal and work-related life, on a daily basis. Ms. Murphy filed in evidence the excerpts from her diary for the period that she worked with Ms. Khalifa, in 2005. Following her meeting with Mr. Currie on April 11, Ms. Murphy began noting in her diary Ms. Khalifa's attendance and the times when Ms. Khalifa would arrive and leave work each day. Ms. Murphy pointed out that her main objective in recording this information was not to verify whether Ms. Khalifa was arriving at a specific time in the morning (be it, for instance 8:45 or 9:00 a.m.), but more importantly to monitor if she was working the full 7.5 hours daily expected of her (37.5 hours per week).\n[43] On April 12, which was the very next day after her meeting with Mr. Currie, Ms. Murphy wrote in the diary that Ms. Khalifa did not come in to the office at all, and did not call in during the morning to explain her absence. Later in the day, Ms. Khalifa telephoned to explain that her car had a flat tire and she would not be coming in. On April 18, Ms. Murphy wrote in her diary that although Ms. Khalifa arrived at 8:45 a.m. that day, she left at 2:00 p.m., having worked only 5.25 hours. On April 19, Ms. Khalifa arrived at work at 2:00 p.m., having explained that she again had had tire problems with her car.\n[44] On April 25, Ms. Murphy recorded that she had to speak to Ms. Khalifa about a discrepancy in her timesheets. Although Ms. Murphy's records were showing that Ms. Khalifa had only worked 32.5 hours the previous week (April 18 to 22), Ms. Khalifa had filled out her timesheets to show that she had worked a full 37.5 hour week. After Ms. Murphy spoke to her, Ms. Khalifa amended the document to reflect the corrected number of hours worked.\n[45] Ms. Murphy testified that she brought this incident to the attention of Mr. Currie who requested that she continue keeping track of Ms. Khalifa's hours, stating that if similar problems continued to arise, he would have to address the matter.\n[46] On April 27, Ms. Murphy noted in her diary that Ms. Khalifa was not in her office and that no notice or explanation for the absence had been provided to Ms. Murphy. Ms. Murphy does not recall if an explanation was ultimately given or if Ms. Khalifa's absence lasted all, or just a portion, of the day.\n[47] On April 28, Ms. Murphy wrote in her diary that she spoke to Mr. Currie about the supervision issue. She told him that with the repeated absences and late arrivals, she was finding it uncomfortable supervising Ms. Khalifa. Mr. Currie replied that he would speak to Ms. Khalifa directly about the problem. Ms. Murphy testified that Ms. Khalifa's personal life or family status were not raised at all during this conversation.\n[48] Following up on his conversation with Ms. Murphy, Mr. Currie invited Ms. Khalifa to his office the following day (April 29), in order to discuss the attendance and timeliness issues brought up by Ms. Murphy. According to Mr. Currie, Ms. Khalifa complained during the meeting about Ms. Murphy's close supervision of her. Mr. Currie testified that he believed Ms. Khalifa had never been so closely supervised at IOGC before.\n[49] Mr. Currie also confirmed that during the meeting, Ms. Khalifa expressed her objections to Ms. Murphy's alleged comments that Ms. Khalifa should work elsewhere, where her schedule would be more flexible and more accommodating to her family-related needs. After the meeting, Mr. Currie testified that he asked Ms. Murphy if she had said anything suggesting (or which could be interpreted as suggesting) that she work elsewhere, as related to him by Ms. Khalifa. Ms. Murphy replied that she had not.\n[50] Ms. Murphy was asked in cross-examination if her conversation with Mr. Currie included a discussion about Ms. Khalifa being a single parent and that she should seek employment elsewhere because of her family status. Ms. Murphy testified that she did not recall any such conversation with Mr. Currie. She recollects Mr. Currie's telling her that Ms. Khalifa had expressed resentment towards Ms. Murphy's close supervision of her work. Mr. Currie testified that during this meeting with Ms. Murphy, she stated that Ms. Khalifa had also brought up a matter relating to another IOGC employee, who had obtained employment at a different government agency. This former employee had called Ms. Khalifa to inform her that his new employer may have a job available for her. Ms. Murphy recalled this latter discussion in her evidence as well, although she believed that it took place in June 2005. She remembers having told Ms. Khalifa that if this was an opportunity she wished to pursue, she should consider it.\n[51] Ms. Murphy testified that after the April 29 meeting with Mr. Currie, Ms. Khalifa returned to her office cubicle and told Ms. Murphy in an angry and loud voice that if she had a problem with her, she should have brought it up directly, rather than raise it with Mr. Currie. Ms. Murphy recalls Ms. Khalifa noisily pushing things around her desk. In her diary for that day, Ms. Murphy recorded, Discussion with Bill re: MK [Melissa Khalifa], Angry response from MK.\n[52] Following up on Ms. Khalifa's reaction, Ms. Murphy testified that she went to Mr. Currie's office to discuss how to deal with the issue. Mr. Currie explained that Ms. Khalifa had displayed resentment to Ms. Murphy's tight supervision of her hours and work performance. Ms. Khalifa was experiencing some scheduling difficulties. To address this issue and afford her some flexibility in her scheduling, Ms. Murphy suggested to Mr. Currie that Ms. Khalifa be offered the opportunity to enter into a Compressed Work Schedule Agreement (also known as a flex time agreement) with IOGC. Flex time agreements allow employees to work an extra half hour per day, thus enabling them to gain 13 compressed work days off per year. Essentially, for every 19 days worked, the employee gets a day off (with one additional day off per year). IOGC's policy made flex time agreements available only to its indeterminate employees and term employees of six months or longer, not to temporary staff like Ms. Khalifa. Nevertheless, Mr. Currie accepted and approved Ms. Murphy's suggestion, and agreed to offer the option to Ms. Khalifa later that same day (April 29th). It was hoped that Ms. Khalifa might welcome the ability to have these extra days off from work, which would perhaps enable her to fulfill some of her personal commitments, such as taking her children to medical appointments or attending their school activities.\n[53] According to Ms. Murphy, Ms. Khalifa told her that she appreciated the opportunity being afforded to her. The agreement was prepared and signed by Ms. Khalifa, Ms. Murphy (as supervisor) and Mr. Currie (as Divisional General Manager) later that day. The agreement was filed in evidence. It provided that Ms. Khalifa's work schedule would run from an 8:45 a.m. start to a departure time of 4:45 p.m., a total of 8 hours per day. This information was filled in by Ms. Khalifa herself, who testified that she did not insert any stipulation for a noon-hour break, since she rarely left the office for lunch. She usually ate while working at her desk. Ms. Murphy testified that she advised Ms. Khalifa that she could nonetheless take a half hour lunch if she chose to, provided she extended her working day accordingly, i.e. to a total of 8.5 hours including lunch. IOGC produced a copy of the policy regarding flex time agreements. It specifies that the starting and quitting time of an employee must respect the organization's core hours of activity, which are defined as 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 to 3:30 p.m.\n[54] Ms. Murphy testified that despite the implementation of the flex time agreement, Ms. Khalifa continued to have difficulty being punctual in arriving to work and maintaining her attendance. There were also discrepancies between the work times entered by Ms. Khalifa in her timesheets and those observed by Ms. Murphy. In her testimony, Ms. Murphy listed a series of dates where she had recorded some of these lapses in her diary:\nMay 4 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at her office at 9:30 a.m.\nMay 6 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at her office at 9:00 a.m. but left at 2:15 p.m. Ms. Murphy does not recall if an explanation was given or if Ms. Khalifa ever made up those hours. In the timesheet, Ms. Khalifa had recorded a departure time of 4:55 p.m.\nMay 12 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 10:45 a.m., after having first called Ms. Murphy to advise her that she would be coming in late. Ms. Khalifa recorded in her timesheet that she arrived at 9:00 a.m. that day.\nMay 16 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 10:00 a.m., after having first called Ms. Murphy to advise her that she would be coming in late. Ms. Khalifa recorded in her timesheet that she arrived at 9:00 a.m. that day.\nMay 24 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 9:20 a.m. and left at 2:45 p.m. Ms. Murphy does not recall if she was notified or was given an explanation. She does not recall if Ms. Khalifa made up those hours. Ms. Khalifa recorded in her timesheet that she left at 5:00 p.m. that day.\nMay 31 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 1:40 p.m. Ms. Murphy recorded in her diary that Ms. Khalifa had an emergency dental appointment.\nJune 7 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 9:15 a.m. and left at 3:30 p.m. Ms. Murphy does not recall any explanation being given or if Ms. Khalifa ever made up those hours.\nJune 16 - Ms. Khalifa took a lunch break of two hours. Ms. Murphy does not recall being given any advance notice for this. Ms. Khalifa recorded a 30 minute lunch in her timesheet.\nJune 21 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 9:10 a.m. and left at 3:00 p.m. Ms. Murphy does not recall any notice being given for the early departure.\nJune 28 - Ms. Khalifa did not arrive until 1:30 p.m. Ms. Murphy did not receive any call advising or explaining why her arrival would be late. Ms. Murphy noted in her diary that she checked with the reception desk to verify whether Ms. Khalifa had called in, and was told she had not. From this date forward, Ms. Murphy changed cubicles so that she was no longer located next to Ms. Khalifa's office. However, Ms. Murphy testified that in order to verify Ms. Khalifa's arrival and departure times, she was getting up and walking to Ms. Khalifa's office every 10 minutes to check. Thus, the times recorded in her diary are never more than 10-15 minutes after Ms. Khalifa's actual time of arrival.\nJune 29 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 10:00 a.m. She did not call in to explain that she would be late. Ms. Khalifa recorded that she arrived at 9:30 that day.\nJune 30 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 9:30 a.m.\nJuly 4 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 9:30 a.m.\nJuly 7 - Ms. Khalifa called Ms. Murphy at 8:55 a.m. to advise that she would be late as she had a doctor's appointment. She indicated that she would be coming in at 10:30 a.m. As of 12:20, when Ms. Murphy was stepping out of the office, she noted in her diary that Ms. Khalifa had yet to arrive and had not called in an explanation. Ms. Khalifa recorded in her timesheet that she arrived at 12:30 p.m., but stayed that evening until 7:30 p.m.\nJuly 8 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 10:00 a.m. She recorded in her timesheet that she arrived at 9:00 a.m.\nJuly 15 - Ms. Khalifa arrived at 10:15 a.m.\nJuly 27 - Ms. Khalifa was away at lunch between 11:45 and 2:00 p.m. She recorded in her timesheet that she only took a 30 minute lunch.\nJuly 29 - Ms. Khalifa was away at lunch between 11:45 and 1:15 p.m. She recorded in her timesheet that she only took a 30 minute lunch.\n[55] Ms. Murphy testified that she raised with Ms. Khalifa the discrepancies between the observed times and those that Ms. Khalifa was entering on the timesheets. For instance, as I already mentioned, on April 25th, the differences were pointed out and Ms. Khalifa modified her timesheet accordingly. On June 6th, Ms. Murphy noticed Ms. Khalifa had entered 35 hours worked in her timesheet for the previous week, when Ms. Murphy had observed only 28 hours worked. Ms. Murphy discussed this matter with Ms. Khalifa, who explained that she was having some financial problems at the time and asked Ms. Murphy to sign off on the exaggerated timesheet as an advance payment for work to be performed later. Ms. Murphy testified that she accepted her request and signed in good faith, in order to afford Ms. Khalifa the flexibility to perform the work when she could. Ms. Murphy does not recall being given any indication that Ms. Khalifa ever actually made up those hours owing.\n[56] On July 4, Ms. Khalifa submitted a timesheet for signature showing that she had worked 27.5 hours, but Ms. Murphy's records showed that she had in fact worked 25 hours that week. Ms. Murphy testified that Ms. Khalifa was often claiming that she was doing some of her work at home. Given the relatively small discrepancy of 2.5 hours, and her inability to verify Ms. Khalifa's claim, Ms. Murphy accepted her claim in good faith and did not bother raising this discrepancy with her.\n[57] On July 20, while reviewing Ms. Khalifa's performance, Ms. Murphy noticed that a timesheet submitted by Ms. Khalifa relating to a previous week showed 37.5 hours worked. Ms. Murphy's records, however, indicated that she had worked only 30.5 hours that week. Since Ms. Murphy was away from the office when Ms. Khalifa prepared the timesheet for approval, another supervisor, who was presumably unaware of the actual hours worked as recorded in Ms. Murphy's records, signed it in her absence.\n[58] On July 25, Ms. Murphy's review of Ms. Khalifa's timesheet for the preceding week indicated that she had worked 37.5 hours, but Ms. Murphy's records showed a total of 27.5 hours worked. Ms. Murphy testified that she did not bother talking to Ms. Khalifa about the discrepancy as she was still unable to verify Ms. Khalifa's claims that she was also working from home. Moreover, Ms. Murphy felt that with all the conflicts that had developed between her and Ms. Khalifa by this point, it was no longer worth it to raise the issue.\n[59] On August 2, which ended up being the last day that Ms. Khalifa worked at IOGC, she submitted a timesheet for the prior week to Ms. Murphy, who noted in her diary that the claimed hours of work (25) exceeded the number recorded by Ms. Murphy (21). Given Ms. Khalifa's departure, this discrepancy was never raised with her.\n[60] On many of the timesheets, the arrival time entered by Ms. Khalifa for numerous workdays is 10 to 30 minutes earlier than what Ms. Murphy had noted in her diary. Ms. Murphy testified that she only raised the larger discrepancies with Ms. Khalifa, particularly during the first couple of months of the latter's employment at the Production Division. In almost all instances, Ms. Murphy signed off on the timesheets nonetheless, without any adjustments being made, having opted not to split hairs but rather, to give Ms. Khalifa the benefit of the doubt with respect to the smaller differences.\n(ii) What were the indicators of Ms. Khalifa's declining work performance? [61] Ms. Khalifa's duties during April to August 2005 were divided into two general categories (project coordination\/reporting duties and administrative duties), which were reflected in a document entitled contract that she and Ms. Murphy had developed together by April 12, 2005. The project coordination and reporting duties were to be assigned to her by the Production Division as well as other divisions. These tasks were to include the production of IOGC reports, communication initiatives involving the IOGC website, the preparation of statistical summaries, as well as working on a document known as Royalty Simplification and Guidelines (the Guidelines). Ms. Khalifa's administrative duties included making travel arrangements for other staff, booking meetings, distributing mail, providing administrative support to Ms. Murphy, and replacing the receptionist during breaks on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n[62] Ms. Murphy testified that on a couple of occasions, Ms. Khalifa did not perform this last task, as was expected of her. On June 9th, as noted in Ms. Murphy's diary, Ms. Khalifa did not relieve the receptionist as scheduled, and no one could locate her. Ms. Murphy testified that she therefore had to fill in for the receptionist herself. Ms. Khalifa appeared to suggest, during her cross-examination of Ms. Murphy, that she had swapped her shift that day with another employee, but Ms. Murphy testified having had no knowledge of any such arrangement and Ms. Khalifa did not lead any evidence to support this assertion. Ms. Murphy also testified that on July 26, Ms. Khalifa called in at 9:00 a.m. to say that she would not be coming in to the office because a relative of hers from overseas had suddenly showed up for a visit. Ms. Murphy, therefore, had to fill in for Ms. Khalifa's shift at reception that morning.\n[63] One of the tasks assigned by Mr. Currie to Ms. Khalifa during her contract consisted of the preparation of the Production Division's work plans, i.e. a document setting out the division's activities. Ms. Murphy testified that this project was time sensitive, meaning that certain deadlines had to be met. Pursuant to Mr. Currie's instructions that she monitor Ms. Khalifa's progress in the performance of her work tasks, Ms. Murphy met with Ms. Khalifa on May 26 to discuss the status of this project. At that time, Ms. Murphy had no concerns about the project's progress, and Ms. Khalifa did not indicate that she was having any difficulty meeting her target times or requiring any additional time to complete the project. On June 9, however, Mr. Currie convened a meeting with Ms. Khalifa and Ms. Murphy regarding the matter. Mr. Currie was worried that the work plans project had fallen behind schedule. Ms. Murphy testified that Ms. Khalifa got quite defensive after hearing his comments but assured him that the work plans would be completed on time. I do not have any evidence before me regarding whether Ms. Khalifa ultimately produced the work plans on time.\n[64] Another of the jobs that Mr. Currie asked Ms. Khalifa to execute during her contract was to coordinate the preparation of the Production Division's portion of IOGC's quarterly review. The quarterly review is a key document within IOGC, which is provided to the CEO, and is the basis upon which each division's progress in meeting its goals and objectives is assessed. The document also enables divisions to inform other divisions of the status of their respective activities. In this particular instance, it was very important to Mr. Currie that this review be well executed because it was his division's first major exchange with the new CEO. Mr. Currie and Ms. Murphy met with Ms. Khalifa on June 22 to set out the process for the report's preparation and her role as a coordinator of the materials to be gathered. She was to work with individuals within IOGC to acquire the needed materials. Mr. Currie sent out emails to all staff within the division who were required to provide materials for the quarterly review and identified the times by which they were to provide them to Ms. Khalifa. Mr. Currie testified that Ms. Khalifa did not complete the project by the deadlines he had set down for her.\n[65] Ms. Murphy confirmed in her evidence that at the June 22 meeting, Ms. Khalifa was instructed to compile and complete a draft of the full review report by the set deadline. Mr. Currie pointed out that he wanted his division's review in the CEO's hands by July 23. It was explained that this was a time sensitive document, a point about which Ms. Khalifa should have been aware, having prepared such documents before. On July 5, Ms. Murphy noted in her diary that she spoke to Ms. Khalifa about the progress of the report. Ms. Murphy reminded her that the report was coming due shortly and asked her what was the status of its preparation. According to Ms. Murphy, Ms. Khalifa was unable to provide any specifics. As a result, Ms. Murphy became concerned about whether the report would be completed in time.\n[66] On July 12, Ms. Murphy met with Ms. Khalifa to review the report's formatting. On July 18, Ms. Khalifa called in to say that she would be taking the day off as one of her flex days because her car again had a flat tire. Nonetheless, she undertook to send in a draft of the document by email later that day. It did not arrive. The following day, July 19, Ms. Murphy spoke to Ms. Khalifa again, reminding her that she was still waiting for the draft of the report. Ms. Khalifa provided it later that day. In a subsequent meeting that day with Mr. Currie, Ms. Murphy briefed him, at his request, on Ms. Khalifa's difficulty meeting her production deadlines as well as her punctuality and attendance.\n[67] Ms. Murphy testified that over time, Ms. Khalifa had become increasingly hostile towards her in their exchanges regarding the production of the review report, to the point that Ms. Khalifa would either refuse to answer Ms. Murphy's questions or would do so in an abrupt manner. Ms. Murphy noted this hostility in her diary entry of July 19.\n[68] On the following morning (July 20), Ms. Murphy spoke to Mr. Currie again about Ms. Khalifa's lack of commitment in meeting her obligations and supplying the report, as well as her increasing hostility towards her. Ms. Murphy told him that she had become extremely uncomfortable with the situation. He stated that he would review Ms. Khalifa's report but that, in any event, given her difficulty meeting deadlines, he felt it necessary to reorganize tasks within the division. He therefore instructed Ms. Murphy to take over Ms. Khalifa's responsibilities for the production of the quarterly review report. Mr. Currie said he would explain these changes to Ms. Khalifa himself. Ms. Murphy had to rush to make a number of necessary corrections to the report, but managed to provide a draft to Mr. Currie for his review, by the end of the day.\n[69] On July 21, Mr. Currie met with Ms. Khalifa to inform her of the changes in responsibilities at the division. Ms. Murphy was also present during the latter part of this meeting. Both she and Mr. Currie testified that Ms. Khalifa was not happy with the proposed changes and with the level of Ms. Murphy's supervision of her. She insisted that Mr. Currie choose between her and Ms. Murphy as to who would work for him in the Production Division, because she was unable to work with Ms. Murphy. Mr. Currie responded that there was no question of removing Ms. Murphy from her position. She was a permanent full-time employee of IOGC while Ms. Khalifa was temporary staff under contract.\n[70] Ms. Khalifa indicated that she was unhappy with the situation, so Mr. Currie asked her what she needed in order to be happy. More specifically, he asked her if she had any suggestion to make for resolving her issues with Ms. Murphy. Mr. Currie claims that she was unresponsive to his question, and did not ask for or propose any solution that would better enable her to complete her work satisfactorily and on time.\n[71] Mr. Currie suggested that the two individuals find some way to work the matter out. Ms. Murphy recalls saying during the meeting that she was willing to work through whatever issues were ongoing, but that she nevertheless remained committed to fulfilling Mr. Currie's expectations of her, which included providing work for Ms. Khalifa to perform.\n[72] Ms. Khalifa was visibly upset with the situation. Mr. Currie remembers suggesting to her that given her unhappiness, perhaps working elsewhere would make her happier.\n[73] According to Mr. Currie, he informed Ms. Khalifa during the meeting that while away on his vacation, he would think about developing some method for resolving the problem. He also asked her to honour her work commitments and to meet her deadlines during his absence.\n[74] Ms. Murphy testified that until this July 21 meeting, her work relationship with Ms. Khalifa was up and down. At times, she felt that Ms. Khalifa seemed committed to doing her job and providing the services required of her, but on other occasions, she found that Ms. Khalifa displayed a disregard for her obligations as a contractor to IOGC. Ms. Murphy described her difficulties in supervising Ms. Khalifa's hours and her inability at finding some means to resolve the problem, as extremely uncomfortable, a sentiment that she communicated to Mr. Currie. Ms. Murphy also testified that at no time during any of the discussions with Mr. Currie to this point was any mention made of cancelling Ms. Khalifa's contract.\n[75] At some point in July, prior to his July 22 departure on vacation, Mr. Currie assigned another task to Ms. Khalifa, the preparation of the Guidelines (referred to earlier in this decision), which contain information regarding the calculation of royalties that are due from the oil and gas industry. It is important to the industry that the Guidelines be released in a timely fashion. Mr. Currie provided Ms. Khalifa with a draft copy of the 80-page document, which he had marked up with a number of changes. He instructed her to prepare the Guidelines, which included having them translated into French, by his return from vacation on August 2. He expected that it would not take Ms. Khalifa more than a week to complete the job. Ms. Murphy noted in her testimony, however, that by July 25, Ms. Khalifa had not provided any progress update regarding this task. As of August 2, when Mr. Currie returned from his vacation, Ms. Khalifa had not as yet arranged to have the document sent out for translation and the final product was still not ready.\n(iii) How did Ms. Khalifa develop a tense relationship with, and show disrespect towards, Ms. Murphy? [76] IOGC contends that the relationship between Ms. Khalifa and Ms. Murphy unquestionably became increasingly tense with the passage of time. For instance, as I already mentioned, Ms. Murphy testified that on April 29, Ms. Khalifa returned to her desk after her meeting with Mr. Currie, and angrily tossed things around her desk, all the while complaining loudly that Ms. Murphy should have raised the timeliness question with her directly, rather than speaking to Mr. Currie about it.\n[77] According to Ms. Murphy, things did not improve over the ensuing weeks. As I already indicated, Ms. Murphy spoke to Mr. Currie a number of times about the difficulty she was having supervising Ms. Khalifa's attendance and work performance. This tension culminated in a complete breakdown in communication on July 20, when Ms. Murphy asked Ms. Khalifa how the quarterly report was progressing. Ms. Khalifa became hostile and non-conversant. She refused to answer Ms. Murphy's questions, who reminded Ms. Khalifa that the document was due immediately. Mr. Currie wanted to review it prior to his departure for vacation two days later. Ms. Murphy testified that Ms. Khalifa's behaviour was abrupt in her refusal to answer any of her questions.\n[78] Two days later, on July 22, Ms. Murphy wrote in her diary that Ms. Khalifa displayed extremely rude behaviour towards her. When she said Good Morning to Ms. Khalifa, the latter did not respond at all. Ms. Murphy noted that over the course of most of the day, she could hear Ms. Khalifa speaking to others on the telephone, complaining that Ms. Murphy had taken over all of her responsibilities at work. Ms. Murphy also recalls seeing Ms. Khalifa speaking to two other IOGC employees elsewhere in the office space that day. She overheard about 30 seconds of the conversation, during which Ms. Khalifa blamed Ms. Murphy for all of these changes in her responsibilities. Later that day, one of those two other employees came up to Ms. Murphy and pointedly asked her what her hand was in the changes to Ms. Khalifa's work duties. From that day onwards, both of these other employees were very cold towards Ms. Murphy.\n[79] The following business day, Monday, July 25, Ms. Murphy noted in her diary that Ms. Khalifa was in a better mood. She brought her children with her to work that day and introduced them to Ms. Murphy. Around 11:30 a.m., she and her family left the office for the rest of the day because they had an appointment with one of the children's physician. The next day (July 26) was when Ms. Khalifa's relative suddenly showed up for a visit from overseas. She visited the office for about 20 minutes with him and then they both left for the rest of the day.\n[80] During the remaining three business days (July 27 to 29) leading up to Ms. Khalifa's final meeting with Mr. Currie on August 2, Ms. Murphy did not make any entry in her diary regarding Ms. Khalifa's behaviour towards her nor did Ms. Murphy make any remarks in this regard during her testimony at the hearing.\n(iv) What is IOGC's explanation regarding the termination of Ms. Khalifa's contract? [81] Upon his return from vacation, on August 2, Mr. Currie asked Ms. Murphy if there had been any change regarding Ms. Khalifa's performance-related issues. Ms. Murphy informed him that Ms. Khalifa's commitments to the Production Division were still not being honoured (the translated Guidelines had yet to be produced), that she was still not showing up during the expected hours of work, and that her behaviour towards Ms. Murphy had worsened after Ms. Khalifa's July 21 meeting with Mr. Currie.\n[82] Mr. Currie concluded that Ms. Khalifa's issues regarding the timeliness of her work, her attendance and her relationship with Ms. Murphy could not be resolved over the two weeks that remained in her contract, which was ending on August 19. He testified that he decided to no longer participate in any extension of her call-up. He knew that the Production Division had the resources to have her tasks reassigned to other employees immediately, so he also decided not to provide her with any further work assignments until the end of her call-up.\n[83] Before proceeding on this action, Mr. Currie met with the IOGC manager of contracts and administration, Mr. Potter, along with Ms. Murphy. Mr. Potter explained that IOGC could terminate the contract of a temporary contract employee like Ms. Khalifa at any time prior to the end of the contract's term, if so required. Mr. Potter testified that he understood Mr. Currie's intention to be that Ms. Khalifa's call-up be terminated that day. Mr. Potter therefore offered to tell Ms. Khalifa of the termination, or to join Mr. Currie if he wanted to tell her himself. Mr. Currie declined both offers.\n[84] After the meeting with Mr. Potter, Mr. Currie found Ms. Khalifa and invited her into a small boardroom with him. He explained that since her timeliness, attendance, performance and behaviour issues could not be resolved, he had concluded that there was little likelihood that her services would be needed by the Production Division after the end of her call-up. He also told her that he would no longer be assigning any work to her during the remainder of her contract and that during that period, he wanted to work with her in developing a transition strategy to transfer her existing work to other employees and to have her return any IOGC materials in her possession. As part of that strategy, he also intended to help her explore the possibility of another division calling her up on a new contract. To that end, he testified that later that day, after the meeting, he spoke to several IOGC managers for whom Ms. Khalifa had worked to tell them that he would not be renewing her call-up but that they could initiate their own call-up for her services from their budgets.\n[85] As the meeting was progressing, Mr. Currie perceived that Ms. Khalifa seemed overwhelmed and was no longer able to process any of the information he was providing. She was seemingly having discussions with herself. At this point, Mr. Currie testified that he suggested she could, at her option, continue to work through the day or go home immediately, and that she would be paid her salary for the day just the same. He claims that he fully expected Ms. Khalifa to return to work the following day and develop the transition strategy over the final days of the contract. He testified that, in fact, when he observed the following day that Ms. Khalifa had not returned to the office, he called her at home and left a message. Ms. Khalifa never replied.\n[86] The evidence of Mr. Potter and Ms. Murphy appears to differ somewhat from Mr. Currie's with respect to the date of termination. According to Mr. Potter, during his meeting with Mr. Currie in the morning of August 2, he understood that the latter intended to discontinue Ms. Khalifa's call-up that day. For her part, Ms. Murphy recalled that Mr. Currie came to her desk after the meeting to tell her that he had been unable to resolve the issues with Ms. Khalifa and that although his intention was to terminate her contract that day, he gave her the option to work the remainder of the day. As Ms. Murphy noted in her diary, Ms. Khalifa opted not to stay but rather left for home at 11:30 a.m.\n[87] Mr. Currie denies standing outside her cubicle, waiting for Ms. Khalifa to leave, as she had claimed in her evidence. He agrees that he passed by her cubicle a number of times but it was in order to have the above mentioned conversations with the other managers in their respective offices regarding Ms. Khalifa's availability for call-up.\n(v) Did Mr. Currie and Ms. Murphy discuss Ms. Khalifa's family status with her and was it a factor in their conduct and decisions regarding her? [88] Ms. Murphy maintains that Ms. Khalifa's family status was not in any way a factor in her dealings with Ms. Khalifa's employment at IOGC. Ms. Murphy does acknowledge that she and Ms. Khalifa spoke to each other in general terms about their respective personal lives from time to time, as co-workers often do. They would ask each other how their weekend was and how their children are doing. Ms. Murphy claims that Ms. Khalifa never told her that she did not want to talk about her family life or that she was uncomfortable about any discussions regarding her personal life.\n[89] Ms. Murphy categorically denies having told Ms. Khalifa that single parents like her should seek employment elsewhere, in the manner presented by Ms. Khalifa in her testimony. As mentioned earlier in this decision, Ms. Murphy does recall Ms. Khalifa stating that she was considering taking a full-time job at another government agency where a former IOGC employee was now employed. Ms. Murphy claims that she remarked to Ms. Khalifa that if that job was an opportunity that she wished to pursue, she should look into it. Her personal life and circumstances were not discussed during this conversation.\n[90] Mr. Currie testified that when he met with Ms. Khalifa on April 29, she complained that Ms. Murphy had made comments suggesting that she should look for work somewhere else, where the hours of work would be more flexible and would enable her to satisfy her family commitments. Mr. Currie raised this matter with Ms. Murphy afterwards by asking her if she had said anything to Ms. Khalifa suggesting (or which could be interpreted to suggest) that she work elsewhere. Ms. Murphy replied that she could not recall having made any such comment, a position she still maintains today. With regard to Mr. Currie's questions, Ms. Murphy only recalls having been told by him that Ms. Khalifa resented the tight supervision that Ms. Murphy had been applying, and that Ms. Khalifa had indicated that her performance issues were related to her difficulties in managing her time. According to Ms. Murphy, it was in response to this concern that she proposed to Mr. Currie that Ms. Khalifa be offered a flex time contract.\n[91] For his part, Mr. Currie insists that Ms. Khalifa's family status was not a factor in his dealings with her and in his ultimate decision to end her employment at the Production Division. He denies ever telling Ms. Khalifa, as she alleges, that she should look for a job elsewhere that is more suitable to her family situation. He admits that one morning he saw Ms. Khalifa arrive at work late looking stressed and flustered. He invited her into his office for a discussion in private. He asked her if she and her family were alright, and whether she required any support. She replied that everything was fine but also told him that she felt uncomfortable being asked these questions. Mr. Currie testified that he immediately apologized and explained that he posed them only out of his concern for her. He also told her that he had some empathy for her situation because his daughter was also a single mother.\n(vi) Is IOGC's explanation reasonable or just a pretext for otherwise discriminatory practices? [92] I find that IOGC has provided a reasonable explanation in response to Ms. Khalifa's prima facie case.\n[93] I am persuaded by the evidence that Ms. Khalifa had difficulty being punctual in her work attendance. Ms. Murphy's diary was particularly convincing in this regard. The document was very detailed and Ms. Murphy was very credible in her evidence regarding how meticulous she was in entering all of her daily activities therein. I am satisfied that each of the entries reflected circumstances as she observed them at the time. She impressed me as a conscientious employee who took her job tasks seriously, and her assertion that she regularly records her daily activities is entirely consistent with this impression.\n[94] An additional factor I considered in assessing Ms. Murphy's evidence is the fact that she ceased working for IOGC in 2005, only a few months after Ms. Khalifa's employment ended. Ms. Murphy had moved to Calgary from New Brunswick in 2004, to accompany her husband on a job transfer. The couple moved back to New Brunswick in October 2005. Thus, at the time Ms. Murphy testified, she had not had any ties with IOGC for almost four years and there is no evidence to suggest that she had any interest in the outcome of the present case. This, in my view, renders her evidence all the more credible.\n[95] Ms. Khalifa highlighted the arrival and departure times indicated on her timesheets, all of which were signed off by either Ms. Murphy or other IOGC managers. Many of these times differ from those recorded by Ms. Murphy in her diary. It must be noted, however, that it was always Ms. Khalifa who prepared her timesheets, not the managers. Furthermore, Ms. Murphy did not sign off in several instances where discrepancies were significant. On those occasions Ms. Khalifa acknowledged the errors and either modified the timesheets, or requested that Ms. Murphy ignore the mistake while promising to make up the shortfall. I accept Ms. Murphy's explanation that with respect to the smaller variations, she decided to give Ms. Khalifa the benefit of the doubt or, as their relationship became tense, to simply avoid engaging in any conflict over the issue. In her cross examination of Ms. Murphy, Ms. Khalifa seemed to suggest that on some occasions during her absences from her desk during the lunch hour, she was meeting managers from other divisions regarding the work she was performing for them. Ms. Khalifa did not lead any evidence herself to support this claim, and this still would not explain her other punctuality and absenteeism issues. Overall, aside from pointing to the timesheets themselves, Ms. Khalifa did not affirm in her evidence that she was in fact at work during the hours indicated therein.\n[96] IOGC has also established that there were significant problems with her work performance, having demonstrated that she failed to meet numerous deadlines for completing her projects, including the production of the quarterly review report and the Guidelines. IOGC has also demonstrated that Mr. Currie had come to realize that a tense relationship had developed between a member of his full-time staff (Ms. Murphy) and Ms. Khalifa.\n[97] Ms. Khalifa suggested in her cross-examination of Mr. Currie that the quarterly report was ultimately completed and provided to the CEO, and that IOGC had granted a general extension for the filing of reports to all departments, implying that there was no genuine performance issue with regard to the report. The fact is, however, that Mr. Currie had explicitly stated that he, as the General Manager of Production and the person who assigned this work task to her, expected and wanted the report to be ready by July 23. He had made a commitment to the CEO to file by that date (i.e., before he left on vacation the following day). Her tardiness in performing this task (she only sent the draft report to Ms. Murphy just days before the deadline), had put this commitment in jeopardy. I do not consider these circumstances to constitute evidence of pretext in IOGC's explanation.\n[98] Ms. Khalifa pointed to the evidence of other IOGC employees and Ms. Larocque to the effect that they were not aware of any problems with her work performance. This evidence does not, in my view, call into question the reasonableness of IOGC's explanation regarding this issue. Mr. Jaques had managed Ms. Khalifa on a limited basis and had difficulty recalling his supervision of her other than to say that she was helpful to people. An IOGC employee, Alexandra Steinke, with whom Ms. Khalifa used to work in the Executive division, testified that she observed Ms. Khalifa doing a really good job and that she could perform any task given to her. However, she admitted that she never oversaw Ms. Khalifa's work in the production division nor monitored or approved any of her IOGC timesheets. She worked at the other end of the workplace and could not see when Ms. Khalifa would come in to work on a daily basis.\n[99] Mr. Potter used to supervise Ms. Khalifa when she worked at reception early in her career at IOGC. He testified that she provided excellent service in that capacity, but he did not supervise her work thereafter. Similarly, Ms. McCurdie testified that her division would have been responsible for the operations at the reception desk. She testified that there were no concerns with performance, attendance or punctuality while she worked at reception. Ms. Larocque testified that Ms. Khalifa is currently one of Sprit Staffing's best and most dedicated employees. She has no concerns about Ms. Khalifa's attendance or punctuality. Ms. Larocque also pointed out that the fact that IOGC had renewed Ms. Khalifa's call-ups numerous times was indicative of their having been satisfied with her work.\n[100] Nevertheless, this evidence does not cast doubt upon the reasonableness of IOGC's explanation regarding the issue of her work performance. Some of the evidence relates to an earlier period when Ms. Khalifa first joined IOGC or, on the other hand, to a far more recent period and in a different workplace. None of it relates to the period during which she was employed at the production division. Most importantly, the evidence regarding Ms. Khalifa's performance issues at the production division was not contradicted, and was consistent with the timesheets (which Ms. Khalifa agreed to correct a number of times, once Ms. Murphy brought the discrepancies to her attention). Rather than denying that she was late in completing the tasks assigned to her, Ms. Khalifa asserted at the hearing that it did not matter if her reports were tardy since IOGC ultimately granted extensions to all departments for the filing of quarterly reports.\n[101] Ms. Khalifa also suggested that there is a contradiction between Mr. Currie's and Ms. Murphy's recollections regarding what he had asked her, during their April 28th conversation, regarding her capacity as a single mother who was working at the same time. He testified that he had asked Ms. Murphy whether she had said anything that could be interpreted as a comment that Ms. Khalifa should work somewhere else where the schedule would better accommodate her family-related needs. Ms. Murphy said that they had not discussed Ms. Khalifa's family status as a single parent. Mr. Currie testified that he did not consider his question to Ms. Murphy to have constituted a discussion about Ms. Khalifa's family status and IOGC similarly argued that there is no real contradiction in the recollections of Ms. Murphy and Mr. Currie. Whatever the case, even if there is a difference in the two witnesses' evidence, I am not persuaded that it is significant enough to cast doubt on the overall credibility of their evidence or call into question the reasonableness of IOGC's explanation.\n[102] Ms. Khalifa contends that if indeed there were performance and timeliness issues regarding her work, she should have received notice to that effect. However, I accept the IOGC's response that given the numerous discussions that Ms. Murphy had with Ms. Khalifa regarding the discrepancies in the timesheets as well as the tardiness of the report, a matter that Mr. Currie had also brought up with her, Ms. Khalifa was indeed put on notice, and both supervisors' conduct in this respect is entirely consistent with Mr. Currie's ultimate decision not to renew Ms. Khalifa's call-up.\n[103] Ms. Khalifa also highlighted the supposed distinction between Mr. Currie's testimony that he did not intend to renew her call-up at its expiry, and Mr. Potter's and Ms. Murphy's understanding of his intent to terminate the contract immediately. As with the family status discussion dealt with above, I fail to see any significance in this discrepancy, if any exists at all. The fact is that Mr. Currie no longer wished to continue employing Ms. Khalifa. On this point, all the witnesses concur. Any confusion as to whether he intended to release her immediately or help with her transition into another call-up during the remainder of her contract is irrelevant. It does not cast doubt on his evidence overall.\n[104] There is some divergence between Ms. Khalifa's and Mr. Currie's versions of what he mentioned at their last meeting. According to her, he said that her being a single parent interfered too much with her ability to do work, and was therefore dismissing her. He denies making such a statement. I accept his account because it is consistent with the preponderance of the evidence. His reasons for dismissing her are clear and well documented, as appears particularly in Ms. Murphy's diary. They do not just relate to her tardiness or absences from work, but her failure to execute tasks and her relationship with her direct supervisor as well. Ms. Khalifa may understandably have associated his concerns about her absenteeism and tardiness to constraints at home of which she may have been personally aware, arising from the care of her family. This may explain her understanding of what was said during their discussion.\n[105] However, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the only factors guiding Mr. Currie's decision to terminate her call-up related to her work performance, including her attendance issues and deteriorating relationship with her manager, Ms. Murphy. Her family status was not a factor. Ms. Khalifa herself testified that she resisted and was uncomfortable with disclosing to Mr. Currie information regarding her family life. Moreover, Ms. Khalifa did not claim or lead any evidence alleging that her timeliness or performance issues were related to her family status. For instance, the evidence shows that most of her late arrivals at work were unexplained or due to non-family related causes, such as car trouble. Ms. Khalifa never alleged that she was unable to perform to the levels expected of her due to difficulties or obstacles related to her family status, nor requested any accommodation in order to meet her commitments.\n[106] Instead, her allegations were essentially that Ms. Murphy had a personal animosity towards Ms. Khalifa relating to the latter's being a single mother, and that Ms. Murphy had somehow convinced Mr. Currie to share the same opinion. Ms. Khalifa contends that Mr. Currie changed his attitude towards her after Ms. Murphy's arrival, a change that she claims was linked to their commonly held belief that given Ms. Khalifa's status as a single parent, she should not be working. The evidence does not support this allegation and it ultimately shows that Ms. Khalifa's perception is mistaken. Mr. Currie did indeed adopt a tougher tone with her, but it was related entirely to her job performance and behaviour towards her direct supervisor, Ms. Murphy. Ms. Khalifa's family status was not a factor either in her treatment as an employee or, ultimately, in the decision to terminate her call-up.\n[107] For all these reasons, I find that Ms. Khalifa's complaint of discrimination under s. 7 (a) of the CHRA has not been substantiated.\nIII. What is the law regarding Ms. Khalifa's claim of harassment? [108] It is a discriminatory practice, under s. 14(1)(c) of the CHRA, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment.\n[109] Harassment, within the meaning of the CHRA, consists of unwelcome conduct related to one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims (Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1284; Rampersadsingh v. Wignall (No. 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237 at para. 40 (C.H.R.T.)). In Canada (HRC) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653 at paras. 29-50 (F.C.T.D.) (Franke), Madame Justice Tremblay-Lamer set out the test for harassment under the CHRA. In order for a complaint to be substantiated, it must be demonstrated:\nThat the respondent's alleged conduct is related to the prohibited ground of discrimination alleged in the complaint; That the acts that are the subject of the complaint were unwelcome; That there was an element of persistence or repetition in the impugned conduct. In certain circumstances, however, even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. An objective, reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor; and That where a complaint has been filed against the employer regarding the conduct of its employees, the victim of the harassment has, whenever possible, notified the employer of the alleged offensive conduct.\nA. Has Ms. Khalifa established all of the conditions needed to make out a case of harassment? [110] The complainant claims that Ms. Murphy and Mr. Currie harassed her on the basis of her family status. The alleged incidents are comprised of the following:\nIn April 2005, when Ms. Khalifa was called away from work, Ms. Murphy stated that as a single parent, she should consider looking for work elsewhere, in a place that is better suited for a single parent. When Ms. Khalifa would mention some activity involving her children, Ms. Murphy would breathe a heavy sigh or roll her eyes. After one of those incidents, Ms. Murphy said that in her own case, it was acceptable to work because she had a husband's support, whereas Ms. Khalifa did not. Mr. Currie met with Ms. Khalifa in his office and asked her personal questions about where she was living and how hard it was to be a single parent. He also told her to look for another job that is more suitable to her family situation.\n[111] I am not persuaded that the evidence bears out that these incidents occurred exactly as Ms. Khalifa alleges. With respect to the April 2005 statement, for instance, Mr. Jaques did not recall Ms. Khalifa being upset about remarks relating to her single parent status, but rather the hard times she was experiencing dealing with Ms. Murphy as her supervisor. This is consistent with Mr. Currie's and Ms. Murphy's evidence regarding the tight supervision they had implemented, to which Ms. Khalifa had objected.\n[112] As I indicated earlier, I found Ms. Murphy to be a very credible witness. She denies having said that Ms. Khalifa should work elsewhere because she is a single parent. Ms. Murphy does recall, however, Ms. Khalifa mentioning that she was considering taking a job at another agency in this period, in response to which Ms. Murphy encouraged her to look into the opportunity. Ms. Murphy maintains that she did not roll her eyes and sigh when family matters were discussed, as alleged by Ms. Khalifa. She also denies having said that in her case, as opposed to Ms. Khalifa's, it was acceptable to work because she was married and had a husband's support.\n[113] As for Mr. Currie, he denies having told Ms. Khalifa to look for another job, but acknowledges having said that given her unhappiness at work, she might want to consider working somewhere that would make her happier. He also admitted that he asked her how her family was doing when he noticed that she was flustered one day. When she expressed her discomfort with the questions, he apologized and did not discuss the topic any further. It is interesting that Mr. Currie forthrightly conceded having made these remarks, a candour that I find lends credibility to his evidence overall. Furthermore, his testimony that she asked him to stop discussing the matter is consistent with her own evidence that she had been advised by Ms. McCurdie to do precisely that, if Mr. Currie ever raised something to which she objected.\n[114] Given the differences between Ms. Khalifa and the other witnesses' testimony, and having due regard to my earlier finding that Ms. Murphy's evidence is particularly credible, I am not persuaded that the incidents of alleged harassment unfolded exactly as Ms. Khalifa contends.\n[115] However, even if the alleged harassment occurred as Ms. Khalifa claims, I find that the incidents alleged do not establish the required element of persistence or repetition to make out a case of harassment. On a reasonable and objective basis, Ms. Murphy's rolling of her eyes and sighing, even when coupled with Mr. Currie's questions about her family, made on one or two occasions, and Ms. Murphy's alleged remark that Ms. Khalifa should consider working elsewhere, do not satisfy the third step of the Franke test. While Ms. Khalifa may have perceived the situation as disquieting, a reasonable person would not have considered such conduct as having detrimentally affected the workplace and created a hostile environment. In particular, I find that a reasonable person would not consider Mr. Currie's comments regarding her family in the context in which they were made, to have been anything more than effort on his part to show some empathy for what may have been troubling her. Nevertheless, he curtailed his questioning when so asked by Ms. Khalifa.\n[116] In sum, I find that the evidence does not bear out that the alleged incidents of harassment occurred in the manner claimed by Ms. Khalifa. Moreover, the incidents, even if they occurred as alleged, were not repetitious, persistent or serious enough to constitute harassment within the meaning of the CHRA.\n[117] For these reasons, I find that Ms. Khalifa's allegation of harassment under s. 14 of the CHRA has also not been substantiated. Her complaint is therefore dismissed.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nOTTAWA, Ontario August 24, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1334\/6408\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Melissa Khalifa v.

Whyte (the Complainant) filed a complaint alleging that the Respondent, the Canadian National Railway (CN) has discriminated against her on the basis of her family status by failing to accommodate her and by terminating her employment.\n[2] CN denies the complainant's allegations.\n[3] All the parties, including the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC), were present at the hearing and were represented by counsel.\n[4] There are two other similar complaints filed against CN. By agreement of the parties, the matter in Denise Seeley v. CN was treated in a different hearing which was heard prior to this one. Although heard together, it was agreed during a case management conference that the complaints of Cindy Richards and Kasha A. Whyte would be rendered in two different decisions.\n[5] Although the facts in the Seeley case and in the Richards and Whyte cases are very similar and that the witnesses for CN were the same, except for Cathy Smolynek who only testified in the two latter cases, the evidence submitted in the Seeley case and in the Richards and Whyte cases is, in many regards, different. The witnesses of CN, who had testified previously in the Seeley matter, did not, without necessarily contradicting themselves, repeat exactly the same evidence in the Richards and Whyte cases. Also, documents which had not been presented at the Seeley hearing were filed as evidence in the Richards and Whyte cases. These differences will explain any discrepancies that may exist in the facts of the Richards and Whyte matter when they are compared to the Seeley decision.\nA. THE FACTS (i) The Canadian National Railway a) General information [6] CN is a federally regulated corporation which derives its revenues from the transportation of goods by train. It is a transcontinental railway company which operates in Canada and in the United States. Its freight trains transport goods 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n[7] CN has more than 15,000 employees in Canada. These employees are organised in two distinct groups described as operating and non-operating. The non-operating group is comprised of employees working in clerical, mechanical and engineering positions. The operating group employees, also known as running trade employees, consist of Conductors and locomotive engineers.\n[8] CN has over 4,000 running trades employees throughout Canada of which 2,400 are Conductors. According to Ms. Stephanie Ziemer, a Human Resources Officer for CN in Vancouver, the figure for Conductors in 2005 would have been slightly higher at 2,500.\n[9] In answer to a question from CN's counsel, Ms. Ziemer indicated that CN does not track the number of its employees who are parents. She added that this information is only solicited when the employees enroll for CN's group insurance benefits. She further added that based on that information roughly 69 percent of our employees are parents. According to her evidence this information would be up to date to May 2009. She added that she would estimate [the number] as being higher because, not everybody participates in our group insurance benefits, particularly if they have a spouse that has coverage outside of CN in terms of their employment.\n[10] Challenged by Counsel for the Complainant about the accuracy of those numbers, Ms. Ziemer explained that they had been gathered by CN's manager of benefits administration in Montreal. CN's counsel then showed counsels for the Complainant and the CHRC what was described by the Complainant's counsel as a thick bundle of names listed by what appears to be personnel number order. Although this list did identify Conductors and their dependants, counsel for the Complainant added that there was nothing about the 69 percent figure. She therefore concluded that someone must have then taken that document and done some calculations. She then asked that the documents where these calculations were done be produced.\n[11] Mr. Paquette, counsel for CN, explained that the calculation had been done by someone at CN's legal department. He then added that he had very likely communicated these numbers to the witness. Asked by the Chair if, when Ms. Ziemer had indicated that the numbers had been communicated to her by someone in Montreal, she meant the legal department, counsel answered very likely, but he added that the information itself comes from CN's human resources department. He added that it was simply a question of sitting down and doing the adding one by one.\n[12] On cross-examination, Ms. Ziemer indicated that she had not done the calculation herself. She added that the figure of 69% for both group was given to her during a conference call, but she could not remember who the person who gave her the information was. Regarding the thick bundle of names, Ms. Ziemer indicated that she was seeing this document for the first time at the hearing. Considering the evidence of Ms. Ziemer, the Tribunal will not give much weight to this part of her testimony.\n[13] For operation purposes, CN is divided in two main regions, the Eastern region and the Western region. The Western Region includes all of CN's rail terminals from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n[14] The Crew Management Centre (CMC) in Edmonton is a very important part of CN operations. It is responsible for all crew callings and deployment for the Western region. It manages the workforce deployment for running trade employees and a payroll of 204 million dollars. The CMC has fifty-four (54) employees who report to Elaine Storms, the Director of CMC. Ms. Storms occupied that position in 2005 and she was a key witness for CN at the hearing.\n[15] CN also has a Peoples Department which includes Human Resources and Labour Relations. Although both fall under the same department, they have very distinct functions. Human Resources deals, amongst other, with human rights complaints, while labour relation will deal with matters arising out of the collective agreement. In 2005, Mary-Jane Morrison was the Human Resources person in charge of the portfolio for running trade employees in Jasper.\nb) Running trade employees [16] As stated earlier, locomotive engineers and Conductors form part of what is identified as the running trade employees. Locomotive engineers operate the engine and Conductors are basically in charge of all the other aspects pertaining to the movement of a train.\n[17] Running trade employees either work road or yard. Road work consists of employees who will get on a train at a particular terminal and take the train to another terminal. A yard employee would typically work in the yard, switching box cars and making up trains. The yard employee does not leave the terminal.\n[18] In terms of hiring, CN tends to hire its running trade employees in large group. According to Ms. Ziemer, CN did a lot of hiring in the seventies and a little bit of hiring in the 80s and in the early 90s. She further added that CN has done significant hiring from 2005 straight through to the end of 2009.\n[19] In 1996, the percentage of women in the running trades was about 3 %. This figure was 3.7 % in 2006 and is now around 3.1%.\n[20] The cost of training a Conductor is around 50,000 to 80,000 dollars. This amount includes the wages of the employee and of the instructor and also, if necessary, their accommodation. The training takes from four (4) to six (6) months. The cost of training a locomotive engineer is between 28,000$ to 30,000$, in addition to what it cost to train him or her as a Conductor.\n[21] In order to be qualified to work as a Conductor, an employee must have his rules and medical cards up to date. These cards have to be renewed every three years. If the employee is on the working board, he or she will generally get a notice telling him or her that his or her cards are about to expire and then he or she just needs to make the proper arrangements to bring them up to date. If the employee is on lay off, he will need to take care of this on his own, although for the rules card, he or she will need the approval of his supervisor.\n[22] When an employee is working or available to work, he is said to be on the working board. The working board includes all employees who are not on lay off. Employees on the working board are either on assignments or in a pool.\n[23] An employee can also be set up, meaning that he will be on the working board at his terminal. The decision to set up an employee is made by the manager of the terminal. The decision is based on the number of employees needed at the terminal to perform the work that is expected.\n[24] There is also another board, which forms part of the working board and which is designated as the spare board or emergency board. Employees on this board are only called to work to fill in when other employees are either on vacation or unavailable to work for any other reasons.\n[25] Due to the nature of CN's operations, running trades employees must be able to work where and when required, subject to restrictions imposed by law and by the collective agreement. In light of these considerations, CN feels that mobility and flexibility constitutes basic job requirements for these employees. It considers these requirements as necessary because of the volume of goods CN transports and because of the fluctuation in traffic which can occur over a short period of time due, for example, to changes in the economy or to seasonal factors such as the grain harvesting season.\n[26] The work schedule of a Conductor is very unpredictable. Depending on which board the Conductor is set on, he or she may know more or less about the kind of work he or she may be called upon to execute. Therefore, all working assignments on road service have totally unpredictable schedules. A Conductor is expected to be available to report to work within two hours of receiving a call from CMC. Once a Conductor reports for duty, he or she will have no idea of when exactly they will return home. They may be gone for a few hours up to almost two days.\n[27] Running trade employees work on a mileage basis. The working board is adjusted on a weekly basis so that each employee can do approximately 4,300 miles a month. When doing the adjustment of the working board, CN will look at the previous week to see how many miles were made by the employees. They will divide this number by 4,300 and the result will indicate the number of employees that would potentially be needed at a certain terminal for the following week.\n[28] At all relevant times to this matter, Conductors in the Western Region of Canada were represented by the United Transportation Union (Union). The applicable collective agreement for Conductors in the Western Region is Agreement 4.3 (the Collective Agreement).\nc) The changes made in 1992 and the creation of the furlough boards [29] In 1992, technological changes allowed CN to do away with the car at the tail end of the train, which is commonly known as the caboose. This decision prompted the elimination of the position of brakeman. After this decision, Conductors, who used to work in the caboose, were moved up to the front of the train with the locomotive engineer. Eliminating the position of brakeman meant that CN needed less running trades' employees to run its trains. The reduction in the number of employees was done through the negotiation process with the Union. The negotiation resulted in the creation of the furlough boards.\n[30] A furlough board comes into existence when there is a surplus of employees at a terminal, but not enough work for everyone. The employee on the furlough board has to remain available for work, but if he or she isn't called to go to work, he or she still gets paid his or her salary. Only a certain category of employees are allowed to bid on the furlough boards. These are called protected employees, while the non-protected employees are not entitled to the furlough board.\n[31] The changes made to the working conditions in 1992, also created the notion of forcing, which produces different results for different categories of employees in the running trades. According to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement, employees hired subsequent to June 29th, 1990, can be forced to cover work at another terminal in the Western region and are obligated to report at that terminal within at most thirty (30) days, unless they present a satisfactory reason justifying their failure to do so. These employees are commonly referred to as category D employees. They are also referred to as non-protected employees, insofar as they are obligated to respond to a recall outside of their terminal.\n[32] Other categories of employees include those who were hired prior to June 29th, 1990. These are referred to as protected employees. In this group of protected employees, we have those who were hired prior to 1982 and who are referred to as Category A and Category B employees, respectively. These employees cannot be assigned for work outside of their local terminals. Employees hired after 1982, but prior to June 29th, 1990, are referred to as Category C employees and may only be assigned to protect work at adjacent terminals. For example, Category C employees at the Jasper terminal could only be assigned to the adjacent terminals of Edson and Kamloops.\n[33] The status of protected employees represents an exception to the general rule. The number of these employees will diminish over time through simple attrition and the status will eventually disappear altogether.\n[34] With the creation of the furlough boards, which in essence allowed some employees to be protected at their home terminal, CN needed to find a way to fill positions in cases of shortages at other locations. This is where section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement came into being. It is this provision that allows CN to force unprotected employees to other terminals in the Western region to cover shortages.\n[35] Prior to the enactment of section 148.11, CN would get employees to cover shortages by issuing what is referred to as a shortage bulletins and allowing employees to bid on these shortages, if they so desired. These bulletins were put out at each change of card which would happen about four times a year. Since it is difficult for CN to predict where a shortage will occur, these bulletins would cover various locations, whether or not there was actually a shortage there. Employees who wished to work at a shortage at a certain location would post a bid for that location and if that location ever became short, the employee who had posted a bid could be called to cover the work there.\n[36] CN still puts out shortage bulletins and employees are still allowed to bid on these, but given that protected employees can now stay at their home terminal on the furlough board and still be paid, there is little incentive for them to bid on these potential shortages.\n[37] CN also uses a system which is referred to as whitemanning which allows it to send a surplus of employees at one terminal to an adjacent terminal. For example, in such a scenario employees in Kamloops, B.C., would be running trains that the Vancouver crews would normally take to Kamloops. According to Ms. Storms, whitemanning is the first thing CN turns to in case of a shortage, because it is a lot cheaper financially than forcing employees to cover a shortage.\n[38] It is also possible that managers will be called upon during a shortage situation. Almost all of the transportation managers are qualified to operate trains. As a general rule, CN will call upon its managers as a last resort after it has exhausted its supply of running trades employees, including laid off employees.\n[39] Employees who are assigned to another terminal pursuant to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement are afforded with certain amenities at their assigned terminal. These include, when available, rooms equipped with kitchenettes and also the possibility of travelling back to their home residence at regular intervals or, alternatively, having CN cover the cost associated with bringing a family member to the shortage location.\n[40] According to subsection 148.11(f) of the Collective Agreement, the first employee called upon to protect work will be the junior qualified employee on lay off in the seniority territory with a seniority date subsequent to June 29, 1990. The collective agreement does not provide for a maximum duration for covering work. If the shortage turns out to be permanent, then CN will proceed to hire people for that location.\n[41] Section 115 of the Collective Agreement provides that an employee who is laid off will be given preference for re-employment when staff is increased in his seniority district and will be returned to service in order of seniority. The provision also provides that if the employee is employed elsewhere at the time of recall, he may be allowed thirty (30) days to report. If he or she fails to report for duty or fails to give satisfactory reason for not doing so, he or she will forfeit all his or her seniority rights.\n[42] An employee who would wish to raise a satisfactory reason to justify his or her failure to report for work would first have to make a request to Crew Management Centre (CMC). He or she would then be instructed to write a letter to his or her immediate supervisor at his home terminal. If the reason raised could have an impact on the Collective Agreement some discussions with the union might be necessary.\n(ii) The Complainant [43] The Complainant hired on with CN in Jasper, Alberta, on April 1st, 1991. She initially worked as a brakeman until she qualified as a Conductor in 1993. She continued to work as a Conductor until she was laid off in September 1998.\n[44] Over her career, the Complainant worked at a number of railway terminals covering shortages, while always maintaining Jasper as her home terminal. In 1993, she worked a shortage in Calgary for almost a year until she was recalled to Jasper in 1994. In 1996, she bid on a shortage in Vancouver and worked there for about three months. In 1998, she bid on another shortage in Terrace, B.C. She was recalled to Jasper in August 1998 where she worked for two months before she was laid off.\n[45] During the fall of 1998, she became pregnant and her son was born in June, 1999. She then took some time off but later returned to the available laid off status. From 1999 to 2001, she worked the Emergency Board in Jasper. The possibility to work the Emergency Board was made possible because of a local agreement concluded in 1998 between the local Union representatives in Jasper and the manager of the terminal. That agreement allowed for laid off Conductors who booked on the emergency board to be called to work ahead of those employees on the active furlough board. This local agreement was changed in 2001 when CN decided that it wanted to be able to call the active furlough board employees before any employees on lay off. CN felt that since it was paying a guarantee to the furlough board employees, but not to the laid off employees, it was financially advantageous for the company to use the furlough board employees first before calling the laid off employees to perform emergency board work. After this change, given the number of employees on the furlough board in Jasper, there was no chance for a laid off employee who booked OK on the emergency board being called.\n[46] On cross-examination, the Complainant testified that she understood that covering shortages was part of her job and that Conductors could be called to work away from their home terminal. She even added that she loved to cover shortages, but that considering her family situation in 2005, she was not able to cover the shortage in Vancouver.\n[47] The Complainant is a single parent with sole custody of her son. Although, the father maintains a regular relationship with his son, the Complainant has the primary responsibility for all aspects of parenting. The paternal grandparents live next door to the Complainant and they have an excellent relationship with their grandson.\n[48] The father runs an outfitting business taking clients into the mountain for wilderness trips. In the winter he also runs a ski lodge. The Complainant explained during her testimony that the nature of the father's work makes him almost unavailable to undertake any parental obligations or duties.\n[49] In 2002, while on lay off, the Complainant answered a canvas by the Union Pacific Railroad for Conductors to cover a shortage in St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A. She worked there from August 2nd to December 15th, 2002. At that time, she made the decision to leave her son, who was then three years old, under the care of his paternal grandparents. She testified that while she was away, her absence did not seem to have any negative effect on her son, but when she returned home, she realized that leaving him behind was a mistake. She explained that he was very distressed by her absence. She testified that the negative emotional effects on her son were obvious. She gave as an example, the fact that he would not leave her side and was upset when she was not present. When his dad would come to pick him up, he would refuse to leave. The Complainant testified that she learned a lot from this experience and that unless, she could bring her son with her, she would not do it again.\n[50] In the summer of 2003, the Complainant was contacted by the human resources department of the Union Pacific Railroad, regarding work on another shortage. She accepted the offer and reported to work in Tucson, Arizona, U.S.A, from October 28th, 2003 to March 15th, 2004.\n[51] She testified that, given the negative impact that her time in St. Louis had on her son, she had determined this time that she was not going to leave him behind. Working with the Union Pacific Railway's human resources department, she was able to arrange to rent an apartment in Tucson large enough for herself, her son and a family member. The railway company covered the cost of travel to Tucson for her son and his father. After a while, the paternal grandparents came out and took over from the father who was able to return to his work in Jasper.\n[52] She also testified that during that period she was by herself for a period of 1\u00bd to 2 months. During that time, her son went back to Jasper with his parental grandparents.\n[53] After her return to Jasper from Tucson, the Complainant noticed that her son was coughing a lot and that he could not breathe well when playing. She became concerned and sought medical attention. In January 2005, the condition became worse and her doctor referred her to a specialist. She was able to make an appointment for April 2005. Her son was diagnosed with respiratory difficulties.\n(iii) The Vancouver shortage [54] In February 2005, CN was experiencing a severe shortage of running trades employees in its Vancouver terminal. This situation was mainly due to a growing economy and an increase in CN's business volume which had outpaced its capacity to provide enough running trade employees locally to cover the work it had. According to Ms. Storms, seventy-two (72) Conductors were needed in Vancouver to cover the shortage and Vancouver had only fifty-three (53) Conductors working, so they were nineteen (19) short. She added that it was definitively one of the most serious shortages that I had seen in my career.\n[55] To accentuate the seriousness of this shortage, Ms. Storms testified that for the period between February 4th, 2005 to January 15th, 2006, the Vancouver yard had 726 overtime shifts for a total amount of $229,350.30. On cross-examination, she added that these numbers included the overtime done not only by Conductors, but also by locomotive engineers and, she added, possibly by yardmasters.\n[56] Ms. Storms also testified that at about the same period the Jasper terminal was in a surplus situation. She explained that when, as it was the case in Jasper, a terminal has a furlough board, is supporting other terminals with whitemen and has employees on lay off, it is considered to be in a surplus situation. But she did acknowledge that in 2005, managers were used in Jasper because of train delays. She also added that for part of 2005 it became busier in Jasper and that after August 6th, 2005, there was no longer any employees on the furlough board there.\n[57] Due to its location, the Vancouver terminal is a very active one. It includes extensive yard and intermodal operations where goods are transferred from and onto ships. The Vancouver terminal therefore constitutes a focal point for CN's Canadian market as vast amounts of materials and consumer goods shipped to and from Asia and North America transits through it and are afterwards transported throughout Canada on CN's rail network.\n[58] A shortage of running trades employees in Vancouver carries significant implications, as it can affect CN's ability to operate adequately throughout its network.\n[59] In order to maintain its level of operation, CN decided in February 2005 to recall laid off Conductors from the Western region to protect the shortage affecting the Vancouver terminal. These employees were non-protected employees with a seniority date subsequent to June 29th, 1990. As such, they were subject to Article 148.11(c) of the Collective Agreement.\n[60] According to Ms. Storms' evidence, shortages are managed by the Board Adjustment Group at CMC. This Group was at that time under the direction of Joe Lyon who reported directly to Ms. Storms. The Board Adjustment Group dealt with the Vancouver shortage of 2005, but because it was short on staff, crew dispatchers were also involved in contacting the employees who were recalled to cover the shortage.\n[61] Ms. Storms testified that during that period she went to Vancouver to help with the deployment of officers. She added that officers had been called in from all over Canada to help with the shortage. She also testified that 2,144 tours had been handled by officers during the Vancouver shortage. She further added that this would be the most usage of officers that I've seen in the west in my career.\n[62] In terms of how long this shortage might last, Ms. Storms testified that if the Complainant had reported to Vancouver, she would have probably stayed there for approximately a year, since the shortage situation in Vancouver was not resolved before 2006.\n[63] According to the evidence of Ms. Ziemer the shortage was eventually resolved over a period of a couple of years by CN hiring the right amount of employees in order to keep ahead of the amount of attrition and the significant growth in the business. She further explained that Vancouver is a very competitive job market: Unfortunately the construction industry was booming. We also lost a lot of potential candidates to the boom in the oil and gas industry in Northern Alberta. [...], it was very difficult for us to recruit over those two years [2005 and 2006], and it became cyclical. We didn't have enough successful employees through the recruitment selection process, so we had to readvertise, hold numerous career fairs. We had to advertise over and over again until we had the right amount of employees. And this was cyclical from 2005 through to probably mid-2007.\n[64] Employees reporting to cover the shortage at the Vancouver terminal, would be asked to show up at the Thornton Yard, in Surrey, and from there, since Vancouver has a number of yards, they would be taxied to wherever they were needed. Employees would only be informed when they got to Vancouver where they were going to work and what shift they would be working on.\n[65] Ms. Ziemer also testified as to the housing arrangements for employees reporting to the Vancouver shortage. She explained that there were two hotels available in Surrey, B.C. One of these hotels was situated several blocks from CN's yards. This hotel, according to Ms. Ziemer's recollection, had large suites with fridges inside and then there was a communal kitchen set up for CN employees. The other hotel was closer to the yard and had suites. Ms. Ziemer added My understanding is that they had kitchen facilities in the suites as well.\n[66] She also testified that CN could approve the rental of a house, an apartment or a condo. She referred to a situation which occurred in Vancouver - although she did not say when - where CN had approved the rental of a property because the price of the rental made more sense economically than paying $90 a night or $100 a night or a hotel for the 20 or 30 days that an employee would be required to be at the location to protect work\n(iv) The Conductors recalled to cover the Vancouver shortage [67] Forty-seven (47) laid off Conductors in the Western region were recalled to cover the Vancouver shortage in February 2005. Ms. Storms explained that employees are recalled on a seniority basis, starting with the senior person in the district. She added that CN would not allow a senior employee to bypass an opportunity to work, because that would mean that they were not protecting their seniority according to the Collective Agreement. At the time of the recall, the Complainant was first on the seniority list of laid off employees at the Jasper terminal.\n[68] Of the forty-seven (47) laid-off employees recalled, ten (10) reported to Vancouver and thirty (30) did not report and either resigned or were dismissed. The remaining seven (7) were either excused from reporting or were required at their home terminal.\n[69] The forty-seven (47) employees were initially contacted by phone. According to Ms. Storms, when these employees were called they were told that they had fifteen (15) days to report to cover the shortage. She further added that she had instructed her group not to venture any information about the possible duration of the shortage since they did not have that information.\n[70] At the hearing, CN produced Excel Spreadsheets containing information relevant to five employees who, according to its Amended Statement of Particulars, had reported to Vancouver. Counsel for the CHRC requested that CN produce the same information it had provided for these five employees for all of the other forty two employees recalled to Vancouver. These documents were disclosed in the form of Excel spreadsheets and contained numerous pages of information concerning their status during the particular period relevant to these proceedings.\n[71] According to the Respondent List of Exhibits in this hearing, CN put into evidence the CATS records for five employees. (See Exhibit R-1, Tab 27 through Tab 31 inclusively.) It put into evidence two other CATS records (See Exhibits R-10 and R-11). Ms. Storms was questioned and cross-examined thoroughly on them by counsels. For its part the Commission put into evidence the CATS records for fifteen other employees. (See Exhibits HR-1, Tab 5 through and including Tab 10 and HR-2, Tab 23 through and including Tab 30).\n[72] The remainders of the CATS records disclosed by CN were put into evidence by the complainants' counsel (See Exhibit C-33). These documents were not put into evidence in the format provided by CN. The Complainant's counsel, during her cross-examination of Ms. Storms, explained that she had created what she described as a document in a new format by re-sorting the information contained in the original Excel spreadsheet provided by CN. This new document was re-sorted in such way that it showed which employees recalled to Vancouver were available on any given date in the year 2005.\n[73] On the last day of the hearing, CN's counsel raised an issue concerning the accuracy of some of the information on the spreadsheets. On January 18th, 2010, more than two months after the hearing, CN filed a motion asking permission to reopen its case to file further new evidence. This motion was dealt with in a ruling which can be found at 2010 CHRT 6.\n[74] CN produced the documents and, as noted earlier, decided to put it in through the evidence of Ms. Storms. We can infer from this that CN felt that she had sufficient knowledge of the information contained on these documents to be able to testify to them. We will go over some of the information contained in these documents in some detail, as it was apparent that they were important for all the parties. In order to protect the privacy of the employees concerned, they will be identified by letters which do not correspond to their actual names.\n[75] The documents indicate that employee AB, although recalled, did not report to the Vancouver shortage. On March 22th, 2005, he was set up at the Sioux Lookout terminal. He continued to work there to the end of the year. Having been set up at his home terminal, he did not have to cover the shortage in Vancouver. Although this employee was set up on March 22nd, the documents indicate that he only worked on March 24th and then did not work again until April 1st. After this date, he works on April 10th and 11th, but doesn't work after that until April 18th. On July 22nd, he takes a personal leave and doesn't return to work until August 12th. He works from that date to August 20th, but does not work after that date until September 22nd. He works again on September 30th and then does not work until October 28th. During the time when he was not working, this employee did not report to the Vancouver shortage.\n[76] Employee HI was working on a shortage at Hornepayne at the time of the recall. He worked on that shortage up until May 18th, 2005. After that he went home for a week and then went to Vancouver to cover the shortage on May 30th. He was later recalled to his home terminal on September 19th, 2005. He took a transfer to Fort Francis on October 29th and worked there until the end of the year.\n[77] According to the documents produced by CN, while he was in Vancouver, this employee started off by doing four (4) shifts of training. After he had completed his training on June 3rd, he only starts working on June 9th. Ms. Storms specified that it could well be that during that time he was still in training, although she did not know for sure. After June 9th, he is shown as available from June 17th to June 26th and then he is off work for miles. That means that he had been at the shortage location for a specified amount of time and he could go home for a few days. He did not work in Vancouver from June16th to July 6th and from July 23rd to August 8th. He has another break on September 1st. His next working date is September 25th. On October 29th, as I've stated earlier, he is set up in Fort-Francis, but does not actually work there before December 22nd, 2005. When asked by the Complainant's counsel why an employee would be set up for almost two months and not work, Ms. Storms replied: I can't answer that.\n[78] Employee P was laid off at North Battleford on February 25th. On March 19th, he took a week vacation and then he was set up at his home terminal on March 26th. As already mentioned, when an employee is set up at his home terminal, he or she is no longer under an obligation to cover a shortage. Ms. Storms did emphasize though that being set up does not mean that the employee is working every day. In the case of employee P, for example, from March 26th to the end of April, he only worked 7 days at his home terminal, but Ms. Storms added that we must be careful when looking at this information as those tours can last two (2) or three (3) days each, although no evidence confirming that this was the case for this employee was submitted. The employee was again laid off on April 24th, 2005. From that date to the rest of the year, this employee moved around within the Saskatchewan zone taking a clearance at other terminals.\n[79] The expression taking a clearance refers to the situation where a laid off employee with seniority in the Western region elects to go to another terminal where a position he can hold is available. When a position becomes available at his home terminal, the employee will return there. If an employee is exercising his seniority and takes a clearance, he or she is said to be working and will not have to report to cover a shortage.\n[80] Employee Y was also called to protect the shortage in Vancouver on February 25th, 2005. On that day he was on a leave of absence, but according to Ms. Storms, CMC would have contacted him within the next few days. Ms. Storms added that she had checked into this employee's work record and that it indicated that he was Absent without Leave on March 4th, 2005. This employee was eventually set up at his home terminal on March 15th, 2005. On April 9th, he was laid off again and then on April 30th, he was given a leave of absence by his trainmaster. That leave of absence lasted until May 13th when he was again laid off. On June 5th, he was again given a leave of absence until June 19th. On June 20th, he was set up in Saskatoon and worked there until July 1st and was laid off again on July 2nd. On July 9th, he was set up again in Saskatoon. On November 4th, he took a leave of absence and then on November 13th, he started training as a yardmaster. He trained as a yardmaster until Christmas and then he stayed on the working board until the end of the year.\n[81] Ms. Storms testified that this employee was dodgy and making himself unavailable. She added that when he was set up at this home terminal, he didn't have to report to cover the shortage, but when he was laid off in early April he should have reported, but did not. When asked by CN counsel why he had not been discharged for failing to report, she answered: I can't speak to that. His manager ... could have done something. I don't know exactly why, like I said, I think it just fell through the cracks. Because he was working, we didn't obviously keep very good tabs on him. Finally, on December 25th, 2005, this employee was set up in Saskatoon. On cross-examination, Ms. Storms added that his supervisor thought that he might need this employee, so he was not releasing him.\n[82] Employee U was called to cover the shortage in Vancouver at the same time as everyone else. Ms. Storms testified that she had personally talked to this employee and had been informed by him that his father was terminally ill. She added that she had then taken it upon herself to extend his time to report. This employee stayed on the laid off board until June 26th 2005, at which time he was given a leave of absence by the trainmaster at his terminal. On July 24th, he was set up at his home terminal. His father passed away in October and he booked off on bereavement leave. After that, he stayed at his home terminal for the remainder of the year.\n[83] Employee E was on laid off status when the recalled procedure started. Initially, when they started contacting employees for the shortage, the staff at CMC would just write notes in their work records as they were making the calls. But, because the shortage was so large, things were getting a little awkward and Ms. Storms instructed her staff to put charts together so that they could see where things were and how many people would cover the shortage. The information we find on these charts were gathered and recorded by different employees at CMC. The first chart was produced on March 7th, 2005. The last entry was for May 19th, 2005. After that, the list was discontinued. By that time Ms. Storms explained that most of the 47 recalled employees had responded or been dealt with.\n[84] The entry on these charts for March 16th, 2005, indicates that employee E had 15 days to report, 30 requested. G. Spanos pls advise or arrange travel. On April 20th 2005, the entry shows Per Manitoba Zone [E] has been given a compassionate LOA until further notice - per Ron Smith - due to personal issue. [The emphasis is mine.] Ms. Storms explained that Ron Smith was the manager of the running trade employees for the Manitoba zone. Ms. Storms indicated that she knew a bit more about this employee's situation, because she had talked with his supervisor after the Seeley hearing. In response to questions put to her by CN's counsel, she explained that Employee E's situation was very similar to employee U. He also had a terminally ill parent and that would explain the entry of May 19th, 2005, which indicates Per Manitoba zone this individual has been given a compassionate [leave of absence] until further notice per A. Nashman and K. Carroll Mr. Carroll was the general manager of the Vancouver, south division, at that time and Mr. Nashman was the general manager of the Western Operation Centre. Employee E was on a leave of absence until July 30th, 2005 and afterwards absent without leave from July 31st to September 8th. On September 10th, he is transferred to another terminal (Brandon, Manitoba) and, finally, he resigns on October 19th.\n[85] When asked on cross-examination why this employee had never reported to Vancouver, Ms. Storms testified that his supervisor had indicated that the employee had not reported to Vancouver because he was training him to be a supervisor, but that ultimately he resigned. This answer is not consistent with the answer she had given previously to CN's counsel, when she had stated that the situation of this employee was similar to that of Employee U.\n[86] Employee FG was shown on CN's Amended Statement of Particulars as having resigned, but at the hearing Ms. Storms testified that this was a mistake. This employee had been recalled to the Vancouver shortage and he reported there on March 22nd, 2005. But from that date until September 21st, 2005, the employee was on sick leave. He was granted what is described as a leave of Absence under the Family Leave Act. When asked to explain what the Family Leave Act was, Ms. Storms answered that she did not know. A quick research, did not allow the Tribunal to identify any legislation bearing the name Family Leave Act. This employee resigned his position with CN on May 6th, 2006.\n[87] Employee O is showed in CN's Amended Statement of Particulars as having reported to Vancouver and to be still employed by CN. But, the documents produced at the hearing indicate that this employee did not report to Vancouver. He stayed in his home province, which according to Ms. Storms was using all of the employees that were there.\n[88] Employee QR was covering a shortage at Hornepayne when the recalled procedure started, so he did not have to report to Vancouver right away. After he finished covering the Hornepayne shortage, he did report to Vancouver but during the period of November 8th, 2005 to December 20th, 2005, he only worked three days. Before November 8th, he seemed to have been working pretty steadily. Ms. Storms testified that she could not speak for the period starting on November 8th, but she did add that there was still a shortage in Vancouver at that time.\n[89] Another employee, employee M, reported to Vancouver on March 25th, 2005, but between that date and the end of 2005, the documents indicate that he only worked thirty four (34) shifts. More specifically, between September 17th and December 31st, he only worked ten (10) shifts. The documents show that this employee was absent a significant amount of time. The documents also indicate that between November 30th and December 31st, 2005, this employee was absent without leave. Ms. Storms testified that she had no idea of the reason for this absence. She added that only his supervisor could give a reason. This employee was not dismissed.\n[90] Employee A went to Vancouver for approximately two (2) months. On May 14th, 2005, he was transferred to Kenora. Ms. Storms testified that the supervisor who made the decision to set him up in Kenora expected or projected that there would be work for this employee at the terminal. But again, the documents indicate that from May 17th, 2005 to August 4th, 2005, this employee worked three (3) shifts in Kenora and that from November 1st to the end of December, he worked only seven (7) shifts. Ms. Storms testified that she could not speak for the reason why the supervisor at Kenora had decided to set this employee up, but she agreed that this person was not working very much.\n[91] Employee C reported to Vancouver on March 15th, 2005. He did work in Vancouver but was also marked as available on many occasions. On May 16th, 2005, he also is set up in Kenora. From May 17th to July 9th, 2005, he worked three (3) days at that terminal and from October 20th to December 12th, 2005, the documents indicate that he did not work at all. Ms. Storms confirmed this information in her testimony.\n[92] Employee DE was also recalled to Vancouver on March 15th, 2005. He had a fairly regular pattern of work while in Vancouver. On June 18th 2005, he is transferred and set up in Terrace, but while there he does not work until September 23rd, date at which he is again transferred to Vancouver.\n[93] Another employee IJ was called to cover the shortage at Vancouver but did not have to report because he was then covering a shortage at another location. From March 17th to May 16th, while covering that shortage, the documents indicate that he only worked one (1) day (April 26th, 2005). From May 20th to May 27th, he was set up at his home terminal in Thunder Bay. From June 3rd to June 24th, he reported to Vancouver, but again the documents show that he is not working for several days. From July 16th to September 1st, he has a fairly steady pattern of work. On September 7th, he leaves Vancouver for Sioux Lookout, where he only works four (4) days up until October 27th, 2005. After that he is set up first at Brandon and then at Fort Francis.\n[94] Employee O did not report to Vancouver for various unexplained reasons. He is set up at his home terminal but the document show that during the period up to December his pattern of work at the terminal is very unsteady. Ms. Storms testified that this information sounded accurate and she added that it would be up to the terminal to release this employee and lay him off. If the terminal set him up and he is not working, there is not much CMC can do about it.\n[95] Employee W reported to Vancouver on April 14th, 2005. From that date until July 29th, he worked eighteen (18) days. July 29th, 2005, was his last day in Vancouver. On July 30th, this employee is transferred to his home terminal. He gets set up there but does not work from August 13th to September 19th. He works on September 20th, but then does not work again before November 12th, when he is transferred to another terminal for seven (7) days. He returns to his home terminal on November 19th, where he does not work until the end of the year. Ms Storms testified that she does not know why this employee was not working.\n[96] In CN's Amended Statement of Particulars, employee BC is indicated as having resigned. But according to the documents submitted at the hearing it is indicated that this employee will be on Great West Life - long term insurance benefits. According to Ms. Storms, the dispatcher at CMC probably talked to this employee's supervisor. The employee was excused from reporting to Vancouver.\n[97] What the Tribunal concludes from this evidence is that many of the employees recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver either did not report and were not terminated or if they did report they were shown as being available for work on various days, but did not work.\n(v) The Complainant's recall to work [98] Before addressing the facts regarding the Complainant's recall to cover the shortage in Vancouver, the Tribunal notes that, in her cross-examination, Ms. Storms indicated that she did not personally keep a file specific to the Complainant's situation. She added that Joe Lyon, CN's Manager Operations, Crew Management Centre, Western Operations, and also the manager of the Board Adjustment Group, who reported directly to her, would most likely have kept the correspondence in a Vancouver shortage file and that the Complainant's letters would have been filed in her Personal Record files at CN. Mr. Lyon was not called as a witness, so it was impossible for the Tribunal to verify this information.\n[99] Questioned by the Complainant's counsel as to why the letters written by the Complainant were not disclosed with her Personal Record files, Ms. Storms answered that the files had been sent to scanning and that the letters were probably removed from the file and not replaced. But she added that these letters were left in the shortage file in Mr. Lyon's office. Asked why this shortage file had not been disclosed, she answered that she wasn't involved in the preparation for the hearing and that she did not know where that shortage file would be. She further added that she had not seen the file.\n[100] The Complainant testified that at the beginning of 2005, she had begun to watch the boards in CN's Jasper terminal, because she was the senior laid off Conductor in the terminal and as a result, she was next in line to be called back to work.\n[101] The Complainant also explained that, having made arrangements for the care of her son, she had begun to book OK with CMC for emergency trips. Her first trip was on February 27th, 2005.\n[102] On February 23rd or 24th, 2005, she received a call from CMC. The CMC employee was asking her how long it would take her to go to work if she were to be set up to a working board. She replied that she was ready. With this call, she felt that she was now very close to getting back to her career on the railroad. She added that she had also spoken to the Superintendant in Jasper and that he had told her that things were getting busier and that she should have her qualifications ready.\n[103] On February 26th, 2005, she received a telephone call from Joe Lyon advising her that she had fifteen (15) days to report to cover a yard shortage in Vancouver. The Complainant testified that she was totally shocked and dismayed by this phone call. She added that she had asked Mr. Lyons how long the shortage would be and that he had replied that it would be a while.\n[104] The Complainant testified about how the call to report to the Vancouver shortage had made her feel. She explained that she had tried to evaluate the options for herself and her son. She also added that, given the negative impact of her separation from her son while she was in St. Louis, she did not consider as a viable option leaving him in Jasper while she went to Vancouver. She also explained that she had worked a shortage in Vancouver in the past and she did not see that there was any reasonable opportunity to bring the child to live with her where the crews were being housed. Furthermore, there was no nearby school for her son who was finishing kindergarten and who would be starting Grade one in the fall. She didn't know if there were any child care options as she had no family in Vancouver to assist her.\n[105] On cross-examination, the Complainant testified that she had had many discussions with her son's father about various possibilities, although she did not recall whether they had discussed the possibility of him providing the primary residence during the duration of the shortage. She added though that she did not feel that this was a viable solution considering the nature of the father's business.\n[106] The Complainant also testified that her first choice would have been to stay in Jasper and work the emergency board until a position opened up there. Alternatively, she would have accepted a leave of absence in Jasper. She also added that she would have been willing to sit down with CN to look at other viable options, but this never materialized.\n[107] The Complainant was also particularly concerned about her son's health. She explained that the search for a diagnosis for his illness had begun in 2004 with her family doctor. She had been able to book a series of specialist appointments for him over the spring and the summer of 2005.\n[108] The Complainant sought some advice from her union and as a result she wrote to Colin Pizziol, the Trainmaster in Jasper, on March 9th, 2005, requesting a 30 day extension to report pursuant to Article 115 of the collective agreement. She added that apparently this request was granted but that nobody had called to inform her. This extended her time to report to March 26th, 2005.\n[109] On March 14th, 2005, she wrote to Rob Thompson, who was Local Chairman of the Union at the time, providing details of the specialist appointment she had set up for her son in the month of April 2005. The Complainant explained that she expected that the Union would pass on this information to CN, but Joe Torchia, CN's Senior Manager Labour Relations, testified that he knew nothing about this.\n[110] The Complainant then considered whether she would be able to report to Vancouver. She testified in detail as to the nature of her analysis. She explained how much she had enjoyed covering shortages in the past and her eagerness to get back to her railroad career. She also explained how her son had been affected by her absence when she covered the shortage in St. Louis and how it continued to affect him to this day. She outlined all the factors she took into account, including the fact that her son's father would not entertain her taking his son away from Jasper and how, given his seasonal work, he was not in a position to come with her to Vancouver to care for him. She added that she would have loved to go to Vancouver, but that her situation, because of her son, did not allow for this. The Complainant also testified as to her son's medical condition and the steps she had taken in trying to get a proper diagnosis and appropriate treatment for him.\n[111] On March 18th, 2005, on the advice of her Union, the Complainant wrote a letter to Joe Torchia. In this letter she set out her family and work history. She explained that in Jasper she had support and had made arrangements so that she could fulfill all her parental obligations and also work as a Conductor. She said: ...going to work in Vancouver on my own would be unacceptable. Taking my son with me is not an option either. She also explained: I am getting extremely close to being set up here in Jasper, in fact I made an emergency trip here on Feb. 27, 2005. I am the senior person laid off. She concluded by saying: I am appealing to your sense of compassion and understanding in asking you to excuse me from being forced to Vancouver. Please allow me to keep my promise to my son, please allow me to remain in Jasper.\n[112] Mr. Torchia testified that he had read this letter and had contacted Ms. Storms at CMC about it. He was then informed that there was more than one request of this nature. He instructed CMC to allow the Complainant an extension of time to report based on the fact that she had certain issues and needed more time to attend to her affairs. He further added that on reading this letter, he felt that this was the right thing to do.\n[113] Mr. Torchia added that he advised Ms. Storms to also grant an extension of time to report to Cindy Richards and Denise Seeley, since their situations were very similar to that of the Complainant. Mr. Torchia further testified that he did not reply to the letter or spoken directly to the Complainant because he had given her what she needed: additional time to report to Vancouver. On cross-examination he added that he understood that CMC would let the three employees know that they had been granted an extension.\n[114] He added that at about the same time he received a call from Bryan Boechler, the General Chairperson of the Union, about these three employees. He said that Mr. Boechler had indicated that these employees were having child care issues and he requested that they be granted more time to report to Vancouver. Mr. Torchia testified that he believes that, at that point, an extension had already been granted.\n[115] The spreadsheets prepared by the CMC regarding the recall do not support Mr. Torchia's evidence. On the sheet dated March 18\/05 as of 13:00 a notation in the row for the Complainant states: 15 days to report, 30 requested - OK to April 6th per A. Nashman. The Tribunal also notes that the notation marked for D. Seeley reads 16 days to report. 30 requested - OK to March 29th per A. Nashman and in the row for C. Richards, the notation states Message at residence to get medical done - wants 15 days. So it seems from these entries that the extension of time to report was granted by Mr. Nashman and not Mr. Torchia. For her part, Ms. Storms testified that she had spoken to Mr. Torchia on a few occasions, but she did not recall specifically what was said.\n[116] The Complainant testified that on April 30th, 2005, she received a letter dated April 25th, signed by Mr. Lyon. In this letter Mr. Lyon states: The Company has accommodated your need for additional time to consider your options and make the necessary child-care arrangements... The Company cannot grant any further time for you to report. You must provide your response as to whether you will be reporting for work in Vancouver or not by May 6, 2005. Upon receipt of this letter, the Complainant said that she called Mr. Lyon to ask if he had been in contact with Mr. Torchia. Mr. Lyon told her that he had not.\n[117] Ms. Storms testified that she did not have a direct involvement in the drafting of the April 25th letter, which she described as a standard letter, but she is sure that Mr. Lyon would have discussed its content with her. She added that she had talked to Mr. Torchia at that time and that he had instructed her to put it on hold for a little bit and we'll just give them a little bit more time.\n[118] The Complainant testified that she thought that there was a communication breakdown so, she decided to again write to Mr. Torchia on April 30th, 2005. In this letter, she referred to a telephone conversation she had on that same day with her supervisor, Colin Pizziol. According to her, he told her that he had spoken with Kirk Carroll, CN's general manager in Vancouver, and with Mr. Torchia. He further added that that although they were sensitive to her situation, they were requesting that she provide a reasonable time frame of when she would report to Vancouver. He also added that the matter was out of his hands. She also informed Mr. Torchia of the medical appointments that were set up for her son and said: It has been a harrowing week, Mr. Torchia. I won't even go into the three hours we spent in the emergency room at the Hinton General Hospital... She ended the letter by stating I would like to request a meeting with you when I travel to Edmonton in May. There is more I would like to discuss with you but prefer not to put it on paper.\n[119] Mr. Torchia testified that he did receive the Complainant's letter of April 30th. He added that he did not recall the conversations with Mr. Pizziol and Mr. Carroll, although he does not dispute the fact that these conversations occurred. He said that after reading the letter, he came to the conclusion that she needed more time to make arrangements and that he called Ms. Storms to ask her to give her more time. He did not reply to the letter.\n[120] Mr. Torchia's evidence in regard to speaking to Ms. Storms at this time is consistent with the information on the CMC spreadsheets. In his evidence, he said that he had given the Complainant and the two other women a 30 day extension. The notations on the spreadsheets for May 2\/05 at 17:00, May 19\/05 at 10:30 and May 19\/05 at 17:00 all indicate for the three women Child care - temporarily on hold per Joe Torchia. Ms. Storms had no specific recollection of the content of her discussions with Mr. Torchia.\n[121] The Complainant also testified that at one point in the spring of 2005, she telephoned Mr. Torchia and had left a message asking to meet with him. He did not respond to this message. Mr. Torchia has no recollection of this call, although he does not deny it. In his cross-examination, he also stated that he did not normally meet with employees and that his dealings were with the Union.\n[122] According to Mr. Torchia, it is unusual that these types of questions would go directly to him. He added that employees making these kinds of request would normally address them to their supervisor. The employee's supervisor would handle these demands directly and they would rarely rise to his level. But, on cross-examination, he testified that even if the Complainant had gone to her supervisor, the result would have been the same, because the supervisor would have had to come to either Mr. Morris or himself for approval.\n[123] Since she had heard nothing further from Mr. Torchia and since CMC was calling her to take emergency trip, the Complainant assumed that her suggestion of staying in Jasper and doing emergency work had been accepted.\n[124] Mr. Torchia testified that in the last week of May or the beginning of June of 2005, he was at a meeting with Albert Nashman and Bryan Boechler, General Chairperson for the UTU. Although the meeting was about different issues, at one point Mr. Boechler requested another extension for the Complainant and the other two employees. According to Mr. Torchia, he and Mr. Nashman granted a further extension until July 2nd, 2005. From Mr. Torchia's understanding, it was clear that this was the last extension that would be granted. On cross-examination, he testified that he was not aware if this decision had been conveyed to the Complainant. He further added that CN had accommodated the Complainant by granting her more time to report. He said that the possibility of granting a compassionate leave of absence never crossed his mind and from his perspective this was not what the Complainant was asking, although he admitted that he had never talked to her.\n[125] Mr. Torchia further explained that a leave of absence was normally granted for reasons which were appropriate to the operational requirements of CN. He added however that he was not aware that some employees recalled to Vancouver had been granted leave of absence by their supervisors.\n[126] On June 22nd, 2005, the Complainant received a telephone call from Ms. Storms. Ms.Storms advised her that she had to report to work in Vancouver on July 2nd or she would be fired. The Complainant testified that she had asked Ms. Storms if she was familiar with her circumstances, to which the latter answered no.\n[127] On June 22nd or 23rd, 2005, in an email in response to Ms. Storms' email recapping her telephone conversations with the Complainant, Mr. Torchia wrote: As far as I am concerned they [the Complainant and the two other women] have been given enough time to sort out their personal affairs. If they wish to extend any further they will have to arrange with their supervisor. Brian Kalin, who was Mr. Pizziol's supervisor, wrote on the same day: There are no further extensions. I agree with Joe - they've had several months to get their affairs in order. It's decision time for them now. Brian Kalin was not called as a witness, so we have no details of what he knew about the Complainant's circumstances. There is also no evidence that anybody from CN informed the Complainant that she should be dealing with her immediate supervisor, Mr. Pizziol, about her request to be excused from reporting to Vancouver.\n[128] Also of interest in the email chain that CN produced at the hearing is an email which Mr. Torchia testified as being from Albert Nashman. Mr. Torchia added that it had perhaps been pasted in from another email but he wasn't sure. He also could not make out the date of this email. This email stated: I talked to Boechler last night. Told him that we are not going to continue to delay this process. They have an obligation per the collective agreement to protect. I told him what are we suppose to tell the next group that says they don't want to go. If he wants to file a grievance then so be it.\n[129] The content of this email seems to be inconsistent with Mr. Torchia's prior evidence to the effect that he had made the decision that there would be no further extensions during the meeting at the end of May or in the first week of June with Mr. Nashman and Mr. Boechler. Yet the email seems to suggest that it is Mr. Nashman who had made this decision.\n[130] The Complainant testified that at this point she was stressed and very nervous. She added that she was quickly losing trust. She could not believe that she was not important enough that someone could not talk back to her. On June 23rd, 2005, the Complainant wrote again to Mr. Torchia. In this letter she explained both the particular health circumstances of her son and the useful work she had been doing for CN in Jasper. She testified that she was hoping that this letter would safe her job. Mr. Torchia did not reply to this letter. He testified that the Complainant had been granted an extension of four (4) months to get her affairs in order and that was as far as we were prepared to go.\n[131] On June 27th, 2005, the Complainant was informed by a letter from L. Gallegos, Manager Operations, at CMC, that she must report to Vancouver by July 2nd, 2005. She was further advised that if she failed to report, her seniority rights would be forfeited and her position with CN terminated. This letter also made reference to a telephone conversation, on June 22nd, 2005, between the Complainant and Ms. Storms. The Complainant testified that when she got this letter she cried and panicked. She added that she was shocked and scared. She could not believe that this was happening.\n[132] Ms. Storms testified that she did recall the telephone conversation of June 22nd, but not the specifics. She said that the Complainant had indicated that she had child care issues. Ms. Storms recalls having told her that CN still needed her to report to the shortage in Vancouver. She added that it was her understanding that the Complainant had told her that she could not report. She doesn't recall if the Complainant had asked for special arrangements, but, had she asked, she added that she would have referred her to her supervisor and to her union representative.\n[133] On June 30th, 2005, the Complainant sent a letter to Peter Marshall, Senior Vice-President, Western Region. In this letter, she explained that her understanding was that she had been granted a compassionate stay to remain ...in Jasper and protect emergency work. She forwarded to Mr. Marshall all her correspondence with the other managers and added that the letter was a desperate plea to save my job. Mr. Marshall did not respond to this letter.\n[134] On July 4, 2005, CN wrote to the Complainant advising her as follows:\nThis letter will confirm as per Article 115 and 148 of Agreement 4.3 your seniority rights are forfeited and your services with the Company have been dispensed with. Your employment file is now closed.\n[135] When she received this letter, the Complainant testified that she was completely devastated. She added that she was deeply offended that someone would think that her situation was only a question of personal choice.\n[136] After her termination, the Complainant asked her Union to pursue a grievance on her behalf. A grievance was filed and on April 12, 2006, Arbitrator Picher rendered his award which was reported in Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration & Dispute Resolution (CROA), Case no. 3549. In his award the arbitrator states, inter alia:\nIn this grievance the Union does not plead any obligation of accommodation to the grievor under the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act, nor any other legislation. It submits that, in effect, the Company unreasonably failed to provide the grievor with a leave of absence to allow her to avoid the recall to Vancouver by reason of her personal circumstances.\n[...]\nAfter a careful review of the facts, the Arbitrator has considerable difficulty with the submission of the Union. Firstly, I must agree with the Company that in fact the grievor did not request a leave of absence. What she sought was a form of super-seniority which would allow her, unlike other employees, to remain laid off at Jasper, with no obligation to protect work elsewhere, while continuing to receive periodic calls to work from the emergency list at Jasper, as she had previously done. A leave of absence connotes a departure from the workplace, virtually for all purposes, whether for an indefinite period or for a period that is fixed. Those are not options which were being requested by Ms. Whyte... The grievor in the case at hand was not asking for an adjustment or accommodation in her work schedule. She was asking, in effect, for relief against one of the most fundamental obligations of the collective agreement, namely the obligation to protect work on her seniority territory in the event of a shortage of employees at any location.\n[...]\nI would have some difficulty in concluding that the Company was unreasonable or arbitrary in refusing to effectively grant to the grievor an amendment of her collective agreement obligations which might extend indefinitely, perhaps as long as ten years, while she would continue to have the special protected status as an employee who could only be compelled to work in Jasper.\n[...]\nThis grievance brings to the fore what must be recognized as a constant in any employment relationship, namely the tension between personal and family obligations and obligations to one's employer. Myriad circumstances might influence an employee's personal or family obligations: care for a child, care for an aged parent or another close relative or care for a spouse with a serious medical disability. Other personal circumstances might include parole or community service obligations after sentencing, close involvement with a church or social group, civic volunteering or competitive sports activities, to name but a few.\nA railway is, by its nature, a twenty-four hour, seven day a week enterprise. Persons who hire on to work, particularly in the running trades, know or reasonably should know that their hours of work will be irregular and that they will, on occasion, be compelled to change location to protect work as needed. In exchange for meeting those onerous obligations railway employees have gained the benefit of relatively generous wage and benefit protections.\nOn what basis can a board of arbitration, charged with interpreting and applying the terms of the collective agreement, conclude that the conditions of single parenthood can effectively trump the obligations of employment negotiated by the parties within the terms of their collective agreement? In a world where single parenthood is not uncommon that is not an inconsiderable question. As a general matter, boards of arbitration, including this Office, have confirmed that with respect to issues such as childcare the onus remains upon the employee, and not the employer, to ensure that familial obligations do not interfere with the basic obligations of the employment contract.\nIt is, of course, open to the parties to negotiate language within their collective agreement to provide possible relief from obligations of employment which would otherwise be borne by single parents or, for that matter, married parents with special needs. Likewise, Parliament or provincial legislatures could promulgate clear legislation to oblige employers to take such factors into account in the administration of contracts of employment and collective agreements. But as matters stand, the Arbitrator can find no discriminatory practice in the policy of the Company. It essentially requires all parents, whether single or married, to respond to their core employment obligations regardless of their personal or family circumstances. It obviously does occur, as in the case of the grievor, that extensions of time and other accommodations may be considered where hard personal circumstances are demonstrated. But in the end, all employees subject to the obligations of parenthood are treated the same, without discrimination based on the status of parenthood. In my view it would be highly inappropriate, when neither the parties nor Parliament have enacted such protection, for an arbitrator to extract from a provision such as article 115.4 and the phrase satisfactory reason for not responding to a recall, an effective annulment of an employee's most fundamental collective agreement obligation to be at work, in a manner tantamount to granting a form of super-seniority. If neither the parties themselves nor Parliament has ploughed any such new furrow, it is plainly not for an arbitrator to do so, bound as any board of arbitration is to apply the collective agreement as it stands. The conferring of what, in effect, would be indefinite and qualified partial parental leave is for the parties to negotiate or for the appropriate legislators to promulgate, should that be appropriate or desirable.\n(The underlining is mine.)\n[137] In reading arbitrator Picher, the Tribunal cannot but repeat what it wrote in Johnstone v. Canada Border Services, 2010 CHRT 20, regarding this award.\n[227] In Whyte the onus was put entirely on the employee to bear any burden associated with working for a twenty-four hour, seven day a week enterprise such as a railway. The decision finds that in exchange for meeting those onerous obligations railway employees have gained the benefit of relatively generous wage and benefit protections. This suggests that an employer can discriminate as long as it pays well, and without a definition as to what `relatively generous' means or what comparative is being used.\n[138] On March 27th, 2006, the Complainant filed her complaint with the CHRC.\nB. ISSUES [139] The issue raised in this case is as follows: has CN discriminated against the Complainant in the context of employment contrary to section 7 of the CHRA by failing to accommodate her and by terminating her employment on the ground of family status.\nC. THE LAW AND THEORY OF THE CASE (i) The relevant provisions of the CHRA [140] Section 3 of the CHRA states that family status is a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(The emphasis is mine.)\n[141] For its part, section 7 states:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\na) to refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or\nb) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, , par des moyens directs ou indirects;\n(a) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu;\n(b) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[142] In considering section 7, it is important to highlight the purpose of the CHRA as stated in section 2:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de completer la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n(ii) The Law a) The prima facie case [143] The initial onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. (See Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons - Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558.)\n[144] Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he or she is entitled to relief in absence of a justification by the respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 208.) In order to prove a prima facie case of discrimination, the Complainant must, in this case, establish that she was treated in an adverse differential manner and was terminated because of her family status, contrary to section 7 of the CHRA.\nb) What approach is to be applied to determine whether there has been discrimination on the ground of family status? [145] The evaluation of whether there is discrimination on the ground of family status is carried out according to the test set out in Public Service Labour Relations Commission v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin), just as it would be for any other prohibited ground of discrimination. However, in recent years, the interpretation of the notion of family status has led to the creation of two distinct schools of thought. Some cases have adopted a broad approach towards the scope of family status, while other have taken a more narrow approach. In order to better understand what is included in the notion of family status we will review a certain number of these cases.\n[146] In Schaap v. Canada (Dept. of National Defence) [1988] C.H.R.D. No. 4, the Tribunal was considering whether relationships formed in a common-law relationship as opposed to those in a legal marriage fell within the protected groups of marital status and family status. In its decision, the Tribunal found the need for a blood or legal relationship to exist and defined family status as including both blood relationships between parent and child and the inter-relationship that arises from bonds of marriage, consanguinity or legal adoption, including, of course, the ancestral relationship, whether legitimate, illegitimate or by adoption, as well as the relationships between spouses, siblings, in-laws, uncles or aunts and nephews or nieces. In Lang v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission, [1990] C.H.R.D. No. 8, the Tribunal stated at page 3: The Tribunal is of the view that the words family status include the relationship of parent and child.\n[147] In Brown v. Department of National Revenue (Customs and Excise), (1993) T.D. 7\/93, the Tribunal held at pages 15 and 20:\nWith respect to ground (b) [family status], the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer.\n[...]\nIt is not suggested by counsel for the Complainant that the employer is responsible for the care and nurturing of a child. She was advocating however that there was a balance of interest and obligation as set out in s. 2 and 7(b) of the C.H.R.A. which must be recognized within the context of family status.\nA parent must therefore carefully weigh and evaluate how they are best able to discharge their obligations as well as their duties and obligations within the family. They are therefore under an obligation to seek accommodation from the employer so that they can best serve those interests.\nWe can therefore understand the obvious dilemma facing the modern family wherein the present socio-economic trends find both parents in the work environment, often with different rules and requirements. More often than not, we find the natural nurturing demands upon the female parent place her invariably in the position wherein she is required to strike this fine balance between family needs and employment requirements.\n[148] The Tribunal finally concluded that the purposive interpretation to be affixed to the CHRA was a clear recognition that within the context of family status it is a parent's right and duty to strike that balance coupled with a clear duty on the part of the employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance within the criteria set out by the jurisprudence. The Tribunal added that to consider any lesser approach to the problems facing the modern family within the employment environment is to render meaningless the concept of family status as a ground of discrimination.\n[149] The Tribunal also considered family status as a ground of discrimination in Hoyt v. Canadian National Railway, [2006] C.H.R.D. No. 33. In this decision, the Tribunal referred to a judicial definition of the term family status, as well as to prior decisions of the Tribunal which set forth requirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on that ground. The Tribunal specifically stated :\n117 Discrimination on this ground has been judicially defined as ... practices or attitudes which have the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic relating to their ... family. (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Mr. A et al [2000] O.J. No. 4275 (C.A.); affirmed [2002] S.C.J. No. 67].\n118 This Tribunal has considered the evidentiary requirements to establish a prima facie case in a decision that predates the Ontario case, though is clearly consistent with its definition:\n... the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer (Brown v. Canada (Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise) [1993] C.H.R.D. No. 7, at p. 13. See also Woiden et al v. Dan Lynn, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 18, T.D. 09\/02)\n[150] However, a different enunciation of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case was articulated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. No. 922, at paragraphs 38 and 39, a decision on which CN put a lot of weight during its closing arguments. In that decision the British Columbia Court of Appeal decided that the parameters of family status as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Human Rights Code of British Columbia should not be drawn too broadly or it would have the potential to cause disruption and great mischief' in the workplace. The Court directed that a prima facie case is made out when a change in a term or condition of employment imposed by an employer results in serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation of the employee. (The underlining is mine.) Low, J.A. observed that the prima facie case would be difficult to make out in cases of conflict between work requirements and family obligations.\n[151] In Hoyt, this Tribunal did not follow the approach suggested in the Campbell River case. The Tribunal summarized its position in regards to that case as follows:\n120 With respect, I do not agree with the [British Columbia Court of Appeal's] analysis. Human rights codes, because of their status as fundamental law, must be interpreted liberally so that they may better fulfill their objectives (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at p. 547, Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at pp. 1134-1136; Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board) [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at pp. 89-90). It would, in my view, be inappropriate to select out one prohibited ground of discrimination for a more restrictive definition.\n121 In my respectful opinion, the concerns identified by the Court of Appeal, being serious workplace disruption and great mischief, might be proper matters for consideration in the Meiorin analysis and in particular the third branch of the analysis, being reasonable necessity. When evaluating the magnitude of hardship, an accommodation might give rise to matters such as serious disruption in the workplace, and serious impact on employee morale are appropriate considerations (see Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489 at pp. 520 - 521). Undue hardship is to be proven by the employer on a case by case basis. A mere apprehension that undue hardship would result is not a proper reason, in my respectful opinion, to obviate the analysis. (The underlining is mine.)\n[152] In addition to the compelling logic of the Tribunal's decision in Hoyt for not following the approach in Campbell River, this Tribunal concludes that the approach suggested in that case imposes an additional burden on the Complainant by suggesting that the protected ground of family status includes proof of a serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation and that this is inconsistent with the purpose of the CHRA. As the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 403, at para. 56, it is not appropriate, when interpreting human rights statutes, to impose additional burdens.\n[153] The Tribunal's approach in Hoyt was cited by the Federal Court of Canada in Johnstone v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J. No. 43, at paragraphs 29-30. This was an application for judicial review by Ms. Johnstone of the decision of the CHRC to not refer her complaint alleging family status discrimination to the Tribunal.\n[154] In Johnstone, the Federal Court agreed with the approach of the Tribunal in Hoyt in regards to discrimination on the basis of family status, and stated that ...there is no obvious justification for relegating this type of discrimination to a secondary or less compelling status. (Johnstone, supra, at para. 29). The Court also stated that the suggestion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the Campbell River case that prima facie discrimination will only arise where the employer changes the conditions of employment seems to be unworkable and, with respect, wrong in law. (Johnstone, supra, at para. 29). The Court also found that the serious interference test which the Court viewed as the approach apparently adopted by the CHRC for not sending the matter to the Tribunal, fail[ed] to conform with other binding authorities which have clearly established the test for a finding of prima facie discrimination. ((Johnstone, supra, at para. 30.)\n[155] The Federal Court's decision in Johnstone was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, although the Court of Appeal stated that it was not expressing an opinion on the proper version of the test in relation to prima facie discrimination on the ground of family status. Instead the Federal Court of Appeal based its reasoning on the finding that the failure of the CHRC to clearly identify the test it applied was a valid basis for finding the decision of the Commission to be unreasonable. ([2008] F.C.J. No. 427, at para. 2).\n[156] The Tribunal has recently rendered its decision in the Johnstone matter (see Johnstone v. Canada Border Services, 2010 CHRT 20). In that decision the Tribunal states:\n[220] This Tribunal agrees that not every tension that arises in the context of work-life balance can or should be addressed by human rights jurisprudence, but this is not the argument put forward in the present case. Ms. Johnstone's argument is that such protection should be given where appropriate and reasonable given the circumstances as presented.\n[221] As discussed above, we are addressing here a real parent to young children obligation and a substantial impact on that parent's ability to meet that obligation. It is not before this Tribunal to address any and all family obligations and any and all conflict between an employee's work and those obligations.\n[...]\n[230] [...] this Tribunal finds nothing in Section 2 that creates a restrictive and narrow interpretation of `family status'.\n[231] To the contrary, the underlying purpose of the Act as stated is to provide all individuals a mechanism to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society... It is reasonable that protections so afforded include those naturally arising from one of the most fundamental societal relationships that exists, that of parent to child. The fact that the language of Section 2 mentions lives that they are able and wish to have carries with it the acknowledgement that individuals do make separate choices, including to have children, and that the Act affords protection against discrimination with respect to those choices.\n[...]\n[233] This Tribunal finds that the freedom to choose to become a parent is so vital that it should not be constrained by the fear of discriminatory consequences. As a society, Canada should recognize this fundamental freedom and support that choice wherever possible. For the employer, this means assessing situations such as Ms. Johnstone's on an individual basis and working together with her to create a workable solution that balances her parental obligations with her work opportunities, short of undue hardship.\n[157] Recently the Public Service Staffing Tribunal (the PSST) considered whether to follow the approach to family status set out in Hoyt or in Campbell River and determined that it would apply the Hoyt approach. In Chantal Rajotte v. The President of the Canada Border Services Agency et al, 2009 PSST 0025, the PSST stated that the proper approach to be followed is the one set out in Hoyt which is also recognized by the Federal Court in Johnstone. (para. 127.) The PSST further stated:\nAccordingly, the evidence must demonstrate that the complainant is a parent, that she has duties and obligations as a member of society, and further that she was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with the respondent's conduct, the complainant must prove she was unable to participate equally and fully in employment. (para. 127.)\n[158] A review of some recent cases out of the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal (the BCHRT) demonstrates that the decisions of that Tribunal are not consistently following the approach in Campbell River. For example, it has not been found to be applicable in the case of provision of services (Stephenson v. Sooke Lake Modular Home Co-operative Association, 2007 BCHRT 341). It has also been distinguished in two BCHRT decisions involving an employment situation (Haggerty v. Kamloops Society for Community Living, [2008] BCHRT 172, par. 17 and Mahdi v. Hertz Canada Limited, [2008] BCHRT 245, paras. 60 and 61).\n[159] In Falardeau v. Ferguson Moving (1990) Ltd., dba Ferguson Moving and Storage et al., 2009 BCHRT 272, the BCHRT referred to the Campbell River, Hoyt and Johnstone decisions, and also to another of its decision in Miller v. BCTF (No. 2), 2009 BCHRT 34. The BCHRT pointed out that in Miller, it had stated that Campbell River applied only in the context from which it arose. It cited the following statement from Miller: The [Campbell River] formulation of what is necessary to establish discrimination on the basis of family status in the context of competing employment and family obligations is not applied mechanically in all cases of alleged discrimination on the basis of family status. (Falardeau, at para. 29.)\n[160] The issue in Falardeau concerned whether an employee, who had refused to do overtime because of child care responsibilities for his son, had been discriminated against on the ground of family status. The Tribunal found that the complainant had not established a prima facie case. The Tribunal stated at paras 31 and 32:\nIn the present case, Ferguson sought to maintain a well-established pattern of overtime hours to meet the needs of its customers. To the extent Mr. Falardeau made the respondents aware of his child-care needs and arrangements, they thought, correctly on the evidence before me, that he was readily able to obtain coverage for his son's care if his work hours were extended. Indeed, he had done so on many occasions. The fact that neither the pattern of Mr. Falardeau's work, nor his childcare demands or arrangements had changed, suggests that he may have made an issue of overtime because of his dislike of work on construction sites, rather than because of his family responsibilities.\nThere was no evidence that his son had any special needs, or that Mr. Falardeau was uniquely qualified to care for him. Although these factors are not required to establish a substantial parental obligation, the evidence in this case established no other factors which would take Mr. Falardeau's case out of the ordinary obligations of parents who must juggle the demands of their employment, and the provision of appropriate care to their children. I am unable on these facts to find a serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation. (The underlining is mine.)\n[161] The BCHRT in Farlardeau was essentially following the reasoning formulated in the Campbell River case. But even if it had followed the Hoyt approach, its conclusion might not have been different. The main difference between the situation in Falardeau and in the present case is that in Falardeau there had been no changes in Mr. Falardeau pattern of work or in his childcare demands or arrangements. Furthermore, his employer had been made aware of Mr. Falardeau's child-care needs and arrangements and it thought, rightly, that Falardeau was readily able to obtain coverage for his son's care if his work hours were extended. Therefore, Mr. Falardeau had not been able to make out a prima facie case on the ground of family status, as he had not proven that he was unable to participate equally and fully in employment as a consequence of his duties and obligations as a parent.\n[162] In the present case, the Complainant by being forced to cover a shortage in Vancouver was facing a serious interference with her parental duties and obligations. The matter might have been different had the Complainant refused to be set up at her home terminal.\n[163] In his closing arguments CN's counsel argued that the Complainant's position was based on an incorrect premise. He qualified the complaint as a request that the employer accommodate the Complainant's parental preferences and lifestyle choices. He added that this position was based on an exceedingly broad interpretation of the CHRA and that the only characteristic raised by the Complainant as triggering protection under the Act is the fact that she is a parent and as such must see to the upbringing of her children. Counsel further submitted that requiring an employee who is a parent to comply with his or her responsibility to report to work as required by the collective agreement does not amount to discrimination prima facie. Rather, he argued that the refusal by an employee to comply with his or her responsibilities in this regard amounts to a choice which is exclusively personal in nature and which, absent exceptional circumstances, no employer is obligated to accommodate. Accordingly, he concluded that upholding the complaint in this case would amount to adding parental preferences to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in the CHRA under the guise of an expansion of the notion of family status.\n[164] In support of his arguments, Counsel referred to numerous cases and awards, including the British Columbia's Court of Appeal decision in Campbell River which he suggested presented a more structured and pragmatic approach than the Tribunal's decision in Hoyt. He also made reference to an arbitration award in Canadian Staff Union v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, (2006) 88 C.L.A.S. 212. In this case, the grievor had refused to relocate to Halifax after having applied for a job which indicated that the place of work would be Halifax. The grievor resided in St. John's, Newfoundland, where he had shared custody of his children with his former spouse. He also was responsible for the care of his aging mother. The union argued that the notion of family status was not limited to the status of being a parent per se, but also extended to the accommodation of the grievor's family responsibilities.\n[165] According to the award, the grievance raised important issues of human rights law which were summarized as follows: whether an employer's designation of a specific geographic location in a job posting, and insistence that an employee who wished to hold that job live where he or she can report regularly to work at that location prima facie constitutes discrimination on the basis of marital status or family status, if the employee's marital and family responsibilities effectively preclude him or her from living where he or she can report regularly to work at the specified location. (at para. 6.)\n[166] The arbitrator dismissed the grievance on the ground that for the purposes of any statute relevant here, and the Collective Agreement, it was the Grievor's choice, not his marital and family responsibilities, that precluded him from moving to Halifax. (at para. 9.) The arbitrator added: what the Employer did here did not constitute prima facie discrimination on the basis of marital status or family status and the Employer was not required by law to accommodate the Grievor to the point of undue hardship.\n[167] In his analysis of the relevant cases, the arbitrator adopted the narrower approach of Campbell River in regards to the interpretation of family status. Although interesting, the Tribunal notes that the facts relevant to this award are in many regards different from those in the present case. In that case, the grievor had applied for a job, knowing full well that the job description indicated that it was to be located in Halifax. The grievor had a choice, he could decline to go to Halifax and remain in his position in St. John's, which is not the case for the Complainant whose choice was either to report to Vancouver for an undetermined amount of time or see her employment relationship terminated. The facts also indicate that there was no significant increase in pay or benefits involved between the job in Halifax and the one in St. John's and that the grievor had applied for the job posted because he wanted a change and new challenges (para. 15). The Tribunal also notes that the grievor's children were 19 years old, starting university, and 15, starting high school, and, as indicated by the arbitrator, although the grievor's sons undoubtedly benefited greatly from his regular presence in St. John's, they required no special care from him, and he could make arrangement for their maintenance in his absence (para. 141.)\n[168] CN counsel also made reference to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal's decision in Wight v. Ontario (No 2), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/191, which dealt with an employee who, at the expiry of her maternity leave, refused to return to work claiming that she was unable to make appropriate daycare arrangements. Her employment was thereafter terminated on the ground that she had abandoned her position. In this case the Tribunal found that the Complainant had steadfastly refused to acknowledge her employer's reasonable expectations that she would take whatever steps are necessary to return to work when her maternity leave would expire. In the Tribunal words: She had decided she was going to be on a maternity leave until October at the earliest or January at the latest. (para. 321). The Tribunal added that this was not a case of someone who, despite her best efforts, could not find day care for her child and had to make a choice between her child and her job. Again a factual situation which is very different from the present one.\n[169] Counsel also made reference to Smith v. Canadian National Railway, 2008 CHRT 15, a decision rendered in May 2008 by the then Tribunal Chairperson. The Tribunal fails to see how this decision can be said to be comparable to the present situation. In the Smith case, although the complainant did assert, amongst other ground, that he had been discriminated against on the basis of family status, the Tribunal found that this ground of discrimination had not been raised in the complaint and that no jurisprudence was presented as to whether the facts amounted to family status discrimination. (para. 289.)\n[170] CN's counsel finally referred the Tribunal to a series of awards rendered by the Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration (CROA). Although interesting, all the CROA decisions are founded on their particular facts and do not help us in the determination of the proper test to follow in this case.\n[171] The Tribunal also disagrees with CN's argument that an open-ended concept of family status would open up the floodgates and that it would have the potential of causing disruption and great mischief in the workplace. As the Human Rights and Citizenship Commission of Alberta noted at para. 242 of its decision in Rawleigh v. Canada Safeway Ltd, decision rendered on September 29, 2009, every case must be weighed on its own merits and unique circumstances. To support the belief that the floodgate may be opened to opportunistic individuals is very dangerous and possibly discriminatory.\n[172] The Supreme Court of Canada and other Courts have consistently held that that human rights must be interpreted in a large and liberal manner. In CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, the Court stated, at paragraph 24 :\n24. Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n[173] From the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that there are two different interpretations in the case law with regard to a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status: the one in Campbell River and the one in Hoyt. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the effect of the approach in Campbell River is to impose a hierarchy of grounds of discrimination, some grounds, as the ground of family status, being deemed less important than others. This approach is not supported by the purpose of the CHRA. Furthermore, all the permutations of the approach applied to the ground of family status in British Columbia subsequent to the Campbell River decision, support the Tribunal's conclusion that family status should not be singled out for a different and more onerous or more stringent prima facie standard. The only solution is to apply the same test as for the other grounds enumerated in section 3 of the CHRA. This approach was accepted in Hoyt and approved by the Federal Court in Johnstone.\n[174] I will therefore follow the approach in Hoyt which is consistent with human rights principles in treating all prohibited grounds of discrimination as equal.\n[175] Furthermore, taking into account the special nature and status of human rights legislation as a quasi-constitutional legislation, the Tribunal concludes that the interpretation and application of family status proposed in Hoyt is the proper one to adopt. As stated earlier, human rights legislation must be given a liberal and purposive interpretation, in which protected rights receive a broad interpretation, while exceptions and defenses are narrowly construed.\n(iii) Has a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status been made out? [176] After considering all the evidence, the Tribunal, applying the Hoyt approach, concludes that the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status. As a result of her family obligation she lost her employment while other employees did not.\n[177] The Complainant is a single parent and the mother of a boy who in July 2005 was five years old. At the relevant time in 2005, the Complainant was laid off. Her son had also been diagnosed with respiratory difficulties and had been referred to specialists. He had several appointments scheduled for April 2005 with a Pediatric Respiratory Specialist.\n[178] In February 2005, the Complainant received a telephone call from CN telling her that she had to report to Vancouver to cover a shortage. After calling her local union representative she was told to write to CN to request her 30 day extension, as per the collective agreement.\n[179] On March 18th, 2005, she wrote to Mr. Torchia explaining her circumstances, her son's health problems and potential custody issues that may arise if she was to leave Jasper. She requested to be excused from reporting to Vancouver on compassionate grounds.\n[180] On April 25th, 2005, the Complainant received a letter from CN telling her that CN had accommodated her need for additional time to make the necessary child care arrangements and informing her that she had to manage these personal obligations in a manner which would able her to fulfill her employment obligations. She also received on April 30th, 2005, a phone call from her supervisor, Mr. Pizziol, who informed her that although sensitive to her situation, CN was requesting that she provide a reasonable time frame to report to Vancouver. That same day she wrote a second letter to Mr. Torchia explaining again her son's health situation and requesting a meeting with him. She also received on June 22nd, 2005, a telephone call from Ms. Storms, who told her to report to Vancouver on July 2nd, 2005. The Complainant then wrote a third letter to Mr. Torchia, again reiterating her family situation.\n[181] The evidence does not establish that the Complainant was a parent that preferred to stay at home and not work at all. The evidence establishes that although Conductors have an unpredictable work schedule, the Complainant had made the necessary arrangements to fulfill the full range of her duties as a Conductor, including being on a 2 hour call 7 days a week, for work out of Jasper. The only issue for her was that she could not leave her son in Jasper at the time of the Vancouver shortage.\n[182] In her various correspondences with CN, the Complainant had explained her family situation. But, she never received any answer to any of these. CN's witnesses testified that parental responsibilities such as child care were not a satisfactory reason to not protect a shortage. CN considered that the complainant's situation did not qualify as requiring accommodation on the basis of family status under the CHRA. It also considered the Complainant's situation as a personal choice not to abide by her professional obligations in order to prioritize other aspects of her life, a situation it referred to as work-life balance.\n[183] On cross-examination, Mr. Torchia did recognize that the Complainant concerns were legitimate and that they did deserve accommodation. But, for him what the Complainant needed was more time to sort out her affairs and that is what he had granted her. He also added that it was unfair to conclude that he had not applied CN's Accommodation Policy: They had family issues and I accommodated them by extending the time they had to report to Vancouver. They [the Complainant, Cindy Richards and Denise Seeley] were accommodated to make arrangements. They didn't and were terminated. Interestingly, he also added: In the case of the two Complainants [Cindy Richards and Kasha Whyte], I felt that they had satisfactory reasons and that is why I granted them an extension of time when I found out about them. This was not the position taken by CN in the arbitration of this matter.\n[184] The Tribunal concludes that the law simply does not support CN's view of family status as not including the Complainant's situation. The Complainant situation as a single parent and the ramifications, as she explained in her various letters, of ordering her to Vancouver does bring her within the ground of family status. She specifically requested accommodation of CN and had directed her request to CN officials. CN's witnesses testified that such a request should have been made to the employee's supervisor who in this case was Colin Pizziol, the trainmaster in Jasper. Unfortunately, Mr. Pizziol was not called as a witness and CN's other witnesses could not testify to how he had dealt with this situation, if at all. The unchallenged evidence of the Complainant was that neither her supervisor, nor any other managers of CN, had ever responded to her letters or taken the time to discuss her situation with her.\n[185] In regards to the evidence submitted at the hearing, the Tribunal concludes that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination based on the ground of family status. The evidence demonstrates that the Complainant was a parent and that this status included the duties and obligations generally incurred by parents. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, the Complainant, because of CN's rules and practices, was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with CN. This being the case, the onus now shifts to CN to demonstrate that the prima facie discriminatory standard or action it adopted is a bona fide occupational requirement.\n(iv) Did CN provide accommodation to the Complainant? [186] To evaluate whether there has been discrimination on a prohibited ground in an employment context, and whether an employer has accommodated an employee up to the point of undue hardship, the applicable test is the one set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada in Meiorin. In that decision, the Supreme Court of Canada standardized the test applicable to discrimination and rejected the old distinction between direct and indirect discrimination.\n[187] Once the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the onus shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the prima facie discriminatory standard or action is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In this regard, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated at paragraphs 54 and 55 of the Meiorin :\nAn employer may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\nthat the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\nThis approach is premised on the need to develop standards that accommodate the potential contributions of all employees in so far as this can be done without undue hardship to the employer. Standards may adversely affect members of a particular group, to be sure. But as Wilson J. noted in Central Alberta Dairy Pool, supra, at p. 518, [i]f a reasonable alternative exists to burdening members of a group with a given rule, that rule will not be [a BFOR]. It follows that a rule or standard must accommodate individual differences to the point of undue hardship if it is to be found reasonably necessary. Unless no further accommodation is possible without imposing undue hardship, the standard is not a BFOR in its existing form and the prima facie case of discrimination stands.\nWas the standard adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job?\n[188] The neutral rule in question here is the requirement to report for work in Vancouver to cover the shortage. In her closing argument, Complainant's counsel stated that she did not challenge that the ability of CN to require unprotected employees to be forced to cover shortage was rationally connected to its stated purpose of being able to move workers quickly to those locations which were short to allow it to keep its trains moving. She added that the rule itself includes the ability of a Conductor to not go when forced, if there is a satisfactory reason.\nDid the employer adopt the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose?\n[189] Again the Complainant does not challenge the honest and good faith belief that from an operational point of view, CN needed the ability to force employees to cover shortages. The evidence from both the Union representatives and CN was that provisions to this regard were negotiated as part of the Collective Agreement.\nHas CN established that it could not accommodate the Complainant without undue hardship?\n[190] CN's third and final hurdle is to demonstrate that the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose. At this stage, CN must establish that it cannot accommodate the Complainant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. In other words, since the Complainant was adversely affected on the ground of her family status by the standard of forcing employees to cover shortages, could CN accommodate her without experiencing undue hardship?\n[191] The use of the term undue infers that some hardship is acceptable. It is only undue hardship that satisfies this test. (See Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at page 984.) It may be ideal for an employer to adopt a practice or standard that is uncompromisingly stringent, but if it is to be justified it must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship. (Meiron, supra, at para. 62.) Furthermore, when an employer is assessing whether it can accommodate an employee it must do an individualized assessment of the employee's situation. In this regard, in McGill University Health Centre (Montr\u00e9al General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital general de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 161, at para. 22, the Supreme Court of Canada stated: The importance of the individualized nature of the accommodation process cannot be minimized.\n[192] In Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489, at pages 520-21, Wilson J. addressed the factors that may be considered when assessing an employer's duty to accommodate an employee to the point of undue hardship. Amongst the relevant factors are the financial cost of the possible method of accommodation, the relative interchangeability of the workforce and facilities and the prospect of substantial interference with the rights of other employees. It was also stated that a standard or practice that excludes members of a particular group on impressionistic assumptions is generally suspect. (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia Council of Human Rights, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer), at para. 31). Employers must be innovative yet practical when considering accommodation options in particular circumstances.\n[193] In his closing arguments, CN's counsel suggested that the Supreme Court of Canada had restated the principles applying to the notion of undue hardship in its decision in Hydro Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ),[2008] 2 S.C.R. 561. The Tribunal does not accept this interpretation of that decision and does not read it as a restatement of the notion of undue hardship. On the contrary, the Tribunal finds that this decision is consistent with the previous decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue of accommodation. In Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, the Court stated that although the employer does not have a duty to change the working conditions in a fundamental way, it does have the duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee's workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work. (para. 16). The Court also stated that [b]ecause of the individualized nature of the duty to accommodate and the variety of circumstances that may arise, rigid rules must be avoided. If a business can, without, undue hardship, offer the employee a variable work schedule or lighten his or her duties - or even authorize staff transfers - to ensure that the employee can do his or her work, it must do so to accommodate the employee. (para. 17.) (See also Jonhstone v. Canada Border Services, supra, at para. 218.)\n[194] CN argues that if accommodation was required under the CHRA, reasonable accommodation was provided by it granting the Complainant more than four (4) months to report to Vancouver, rather than the minimum fifteen (15) days set out in the Collective Agreement. CN further states that granting the relief sought by the Complainant would constitute undue hardship because it would effectively grant all employees who are parents an equivalent to super seniority under the Collective Agreement solely on the basis of their status as parents.\n[195] I will address first the claim that reasonable accommodation was provided.\n[196] CN argues that providing extra time to the Complainant to report to Vancouver was all that it was required to provide. However, the evidence clearly shows that that was not in any way a meaningful response to the Complainant's request and to the factual underpinnings of her situation which she had communicated to the employer through her correspondence. The evidence also shows that the decision was made without anybody discussing it with the Complainant.\n[197] The evidence establishes that the Complainant wrote to Mr. Torchia and to other senior managers at CN setting out the details of her family situation, her assessment of why her family duties and responsibilities prevented her from reporting to the shortage in Vancouver. She had also clearly indicated that she was ready and willing to cover all aspects of her job as a Conductor in Jasper where she had the necessary child care and family supports.\n[198] The evidence clearly establishes that CN was not sensitive to the Complainant's situation. It did not answer her many requests for some form of accommodation and did not even meet or contact her to discuss her situation, even though its own accommodation policy directs that the employee be met as a first step in the process. It is also clear from there evidence, that neither Ms. Storms, nor Mr. Torchia felt that they had any responsibility regarding any issue pertaining to the CHRA. They both testified that the supervisor of the employee and Human Resources were the ones with whom this issue should have been raised. Unfortunately, Mr. Pizziol, the Complainant supervisor, was not called as a witness and neither was Mary-Jane Morrison, the person responsible for Human Resources in Edmonton in 2005.\n[199] It is clear that CN witnesses did not consider family status - at least, family status matters that involve parental obligations and responsibilities - as a ground of discrimination that necessitated any form of accommodation. In their conception of the various grounds of discrimination set out in the CHRA, they seem to have chosen some grounds as opening a right to accommodation and others that did not. For example, they testified that CN had not hesitated to accommodate some employees who were recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver because of a sick parent. They also acknowledge that CN had in the past accommodated employees for medical reason. But without inquiring into the nature of her request, they decided that the Complainant's situation did not qualify as one requiring accommodation under the CHRA.\n[200] The evidence of Mr. Torchia is that he was aware of the Complainant's situation and that he had come to the conclusion that what she needed was more time to sort out her affairs. He never had any discussions with the Complainant, nor did he delegate the matter to another manager so that he could discuss the Complainant's request with her. He felt that he knew what she needed and that he had given her what she needed.\n[201] For her part, Ms. Storms, who was monitoring the CMC spreadsheets, knew that the Complainant's situation had been labeled child care issue. In her evidence she suggested that many of the employees recalled had also raised child care issues and that it was becoming a general theme. However, no other employees, other than the Complainant, Denise Seeley and Cindy Richards, had child care noted on the spreadsheets and Mr. Torchia testified that he knew of no other case but these where child care issues had been raised.\n[202] Since it was her department who was supervising the information concerning the employees recalled to the shortage, Ms. Storms had the opportunity to initiate CN's Accommodation Policy in the case of the Complainant, but she did not. Interestingly, Ms. Storms testified that she had initiated an accommodation in the case of another employee who had also been recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver. That employee had a terminally ill parent and she gave him a leave of absence. She was also aware from a review of the CMC spreadsheets that other employees had been excused from reporting to Vancouver due to disability and for various other personal reasons which were left unexplained.\n[203] In an email correspondence dated June 23rd, 2005, Ms. Storms summarized her telephone discussions with the Complainant and with Ms. Richards and Ms. Seeley. She mentioned that the Complainant had a son who was ill and that she had custody issues. She also mentions that the Complainant had written to Mr. Torchia. She further wrote that if the Complainant and the two other women decided not to protect the shortage in Vancouver, their employment files would be closed and their seniority forfeited. This email was sent to Ms. Gallegos, and copied to Mr. Nashman, Mr. Torchia, Kenneth Sherman and Brian Kallin (Mr. Pizziol's supervisor). None of these managers thought that it might be appropriate, in the face of the Complainant's situation, to initiate the Accommodation Policy.\n[204] The evidence also indicates that CN did not apply its own accommodations guidelines and policies in the Complainant's case. CN has a very comprehensive accommodation policy. This policy recognizes all the prohibited grounds enumerated in the CHRA, including family status, and the policy clearly indicates that, wherever possible, employment policies and practices are to be adjusted so that no individual is denied employment opportunities... It also specifies that accommodation means making every possible effort to meet the reasonable needs of employees.\n[205] CN Accommodation Guidelines explains that the objective of the Policy is to ensure that working conditions are not a barrier to employment. It also makes clear that CN has to show flexibility in eliminating any barriers and that it should make every effort to ensure that no one is put at a disadvantage because of a special need or requirement.\n[206] The policy also defines the process to be followed in case of a request for accommodation where one of the enumerated grounds is raised and it provides a checklist to be followed by managers and supervisors in case of such a request. The Policy explains:\nThe first thing to do when an employee reports a problem or special need is to meet with the individual. Allow the employee to present the problem or need, ask questions to fully understand the request, and together discuss possible solutions.\nIf no solutions can be identified in this manner, do not reject the request outright. Ask for advice, seek other solutions to the problem, and evaluate the impact of any potential accommodation with the appropriate functions, including the People department, among other. The employee has the responsibility to participate actively in the process, and to facilitate reasonable accommodation. Unions also have a recognized and important role and responsibility in the accommodation of the needs of employees.\nIt is extremely important to keep records of the meeting held, the various solutions proposed, and the arguments used to accept or reject each option. This information is indispensable in the event of a complaint.\nPromptly inform the person in question of the decision taken, explaining the reasons for the decision. In the event that a request for accommodation is denied, employees may have a right to grieve under the appropriate grievance procedure or make a complaint under the CHRA.\n[207] Ms. Ziemer testified that the Policy is aimed at doing an individualized assessment of the employee's situation, since every situation is different. In the case of the Complainant it is clear that no individualized assessment was done.\n[208] The person responsible for the accommodation policy at CN's Edmonton office is, as indicated earlier, Mary-Jane Morrison, a Human Resources Officer. It is with her that people who have questions about the policy or its procedure consult. Ms. Morrison was not a witness at the hearing. Instead, CN called as a witness Stephanie Ziemer, the Human Resources Officer in Vancouver. Ms. Ziemer testified as to her understanding of what family status covered as a ground of discrimination. She explained that from her perspective as a human resources manager, family status means that an employer cannot discriminate against somebody who has a family, either a parent who has children or any individual that is a member of a family. She further added certainly family status, from my understanding [...] would not incorporate any kind of or individualized parental obligations. These are very individualized and personal preferences that people have, and certainly I never saw it as coming under our policy to being involved in these types of individualized parental preferences.\n[209] On cross-examination, Ms. Ziemer was asked to explain what she meant by individualized parental preferences. She stated: Whether or not you want to be at home to put, you know, your child to bed. Whether or not you want to attend every sporting event with your child. I mean, those are all things that we'd like to do as parents, but they would not be sufficient to initiate the accommodation process. She did add though that taking care of an ill child, having issues regarding a custody order or being a single parent would be a different thing and that it might open the door to discussions. She agreed that it was CN's expectation that single parents, if they want to be railroaders, have to manage their affairs so that they can perform their working obligations. But, she also added that if something unusual came along, for example, being asked to go cover a shortage, that might open the door to discussions.\n[210] Once the door is opened, the process provides that there should be a meeting between the employee and a supervisor, so that the latter can get a feeling of what is the problem. Ms. Ziemer acknowledged that the simple exchange of letters at this stage would not be as efficient. At that meeting the supervisor should ask more information about the reasons for the request and discuss possible solutions.\n[211] Ms. Ziemer testified that she had no hands on implication or any personal knowledge of the Complainant's situation. She also added that Human Resources is not always involved in these cases. Whenever possible, these cases are dealt with at the local level. She further stated that CN had trained its managers well enough that they have the abilities to make good management decision, protecting the operation and making, where necessary, small adaptations or small adjustments to the working conditions of the employee.\n[212] Ms. Ziemer gave various examples of situations where CN had accommodated employees on the basis of family status, starting with her own situation. She explained that her husband had been severely injured in a skiing accident. For a period of ten weeks, he could not move his arm or upper body. During this period, she explained that she was allowed not to travel and was given a flexible working schedule. She also testified to the accommodations given to an individual in Vancouver so he could be available for his son who was involved in illegal activities, including gang-related activities and to a Conductor whose daughter had a significant psychological breakdown. This employee was allowed to work closer to home for a rather lengthy period of time. She added that CN had also accommodated a market manager upon her return from parental leave because her child had a severe eating disorder. This employee was given additional time off upon completion of her parental leave.\n[213] On cross-examination by Counsel for the CHRC, Ms. Ziemer was reminded of two other examples that she had referred to in the Seeley hearing. One of these was an accommodation for an employee which allowed him to be absent from the working board every second weekend because he only had visitation rights for 48 hours every two weeks. The other was an accommodation granted to an employee who was involved in a lengthy custody battle in Court. This person was given additional time off for this reason.\n[214] She further testified that most of these cases had been dealt with at the local level. She further added that supervisors are trained to pick up on that type of request. But, she stated unfortunately we can't supervise what they're doing out there in the field in terms of putting the actual teachings to use. We would like to think that they are well conversant in our policies, well trained. But whether or not that Supervisor A at Location B would be able to pick up on the issue coming forward, I can't say definitively that that would happen.\n[215] According to Ms. Ziemer, although there are no mechanism to evaluate the application of the policy, CN's expectations is that the front line supervisors are doing the right thing in terms of the policy, are living up to the policy and are abiding by the intricacies of the policy. She added that when the policy is not followed, Human Resources usually hear about it through various correspondences, or from their counterparts on the labour relations side. As a general rule, she testified that CN is operating on the notion that its supervisors are following the policy in terms of what they have been taught and what CN's expectations are.\n[216] Ms. Ziemer also testified on cross-examination that the process described in the accommodation policy would start as soon as an employee came forward and reported a problem or special need, although she added that that would not necessarily always lead to a decision that accommodation is necessary. When asked by Complainant's counsel why this process had not been initiated in the Complainant's case, she answered that she did not know, because she had not been involved in this case. She also added that usually the employee goes to his or her immediate supervisor as the first step.\n[217] Mr. Torchia testified that he had not met with the Complainant, because this would ordinarily be done by the Complainant's supervisor. He added that he did not know for a fact whether her supervisor had met with her, but he would assume he did because he had a telephone conversation with him and that he was aware of the situation.\n[218] On cross-examination, he testified that he had received training with regard to the duty to accommodate many years ago, in the early nineties. For her part, Ms. Storms testified that she did not recall receiving any training on CN's accommodation policy. She added that she knew about the policy and that if she had some concerns about it, she would talk to somebody in Human Resources. Ms. Storms further added that she never really used the accommodation policy, because CMC does not get many requests for accommodation. She did acknowledge though that there were times where CMC had accommodated employees because of serious illnesses in the employee's family or because somebody needed time off for personal reasons.\n[219] She further testified that although she remembered having read the policy, she was not very familiar with it and did not have a detailed knowledge of it. She did not know if anybody else at CMC had had training on the policy. On cross-examination from counsel for the CHRC she answered that to her knowledge none of the dispatchers and\/or members of the Board Adjustment Group, who were primarily responsible for contacting the employees recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver, had any training regarding CN's accommodation policy. Asked to explain how they would recognize an issue of accommodation if one came up, Ms. Storms answered that they knew that CN accommodates people and that sometimes they are aware of an employee's situation. The general rule would be for them to refer an employee with special request to his supervisor.\n[220] According to the Complainant's evidence, CN's accommodation policy was not followed in her case. She added that she never met with her supervisor, the trainmaster in Jasper, nor did she get any response to the letters she had sent to supervisors or managers of CN explaining her situation. There was also no evidence that she had met with anybody at Human Resources or that she had been referred to them. It is clear from the evidence that CN did not follow the procedure set out in its own policy and that it had decided that family status, at least in terms of parental obligations and responsibilities, was not a ground of discrimination for which accommodation was required. It is also clear that CN never did an individualized assessment of the Complainant's situation as it was required to do.\n[221] Even if I was to accept the evidence that CN had provided some form of accommodation by granting the plaintiff more time to report to Vancouver, CN's failure to meet the procedural obligations of the duty to accommodate would in itself still give rise to a violation of the Complainant's human rights. The Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged that both the decision-making process and the final decision have to be taken into consideration in analyzing a BFOR. In Meiorin, the Court states at para. 66: It may often be useful as a practical matter to consider separately, first, the procedure, if any, which was adopted to assess the issue of accommodation and, second, the substantive content of either a more accommodating standard which was offered or alternatively the employer's reasons for not offering any such standard. (See also Oak Bay Marina Ltd. v. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal) (No. 2), 2004 BCHRT 225, at paras. 84-86).\n[222] In Lane v. ADGA Group Consultant Inc., 2007 HRTO 34, at para. 150, (decision upheld by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Divisional Court, at [2008] O.J. No. 3076, 91 O.R.(3d) 649) the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal held that:\n...[T]he failure to meet the procedural dimensions of the duty to accommodate is a form of discrimination. It denies the affected person the benefit of what the law requires: a recognition of the obligation not to discriminate and to act in such a way as to ensure that discrimination does not take place.\n[223] In Meiorin, the Supreme Court identified the following question as being relevant in analyzing the procedural part of the accommodation process followed by the employer:\nHas the employer investigated alternative approaches that do not have a discriminatory effect, such as individual testing against a more individually sensitive standard? If alternative standards were investigated and found to be capable of fulfilling the employer's purpose, why were they not implemented? Is it necessary to have all employees meet the single standard for the employer to accomplish its legitimate purpose or could standards reflective of group or individual differences and capabilities be established? Is there a way to do the job that is less discriminatory while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate purpose? Is the standard properly designed to ensure that the desired qualification is met without placing an undue burden on those to whom the standard applies? Have other parties who are obliged to assist in the search for possible accommodation fulfilled their roles?\n[224] To meet the procedural component of the duty to accommodate, CN had a duty to show that it had considered and reasonably rejected any accommodation that would have accommodated the needs of the Complainant.\n[225] The only evidence that an assessment of other forms of accommodation might have occurred is the evidence that the Union had suggested canvassing the employees in Jasper to see if anybody would volunteer to cover the shortage instead of the Complainant, Cindy Richards and Denise Seeley. But, since nobody came forward, the canvassing stopped. There is no evidence that CN did an individualized assessment of the Complainant's situation or investigated any alternative forms of accommodation.\n[226] I will now deal with CN's position to the effect that it would be undue hardship to grant the relief sought by the Complainant because she would then be granted super seniority based on the simple fact of her status as a parent.\n[227] According to Stephanie Ziemer, CN does not capture the information regarding how many of its employees are parents. She added that the only way to have this information would be to review each employee's file to see who they designate as dependants. Ms. Ziemer further added that from CN's employees group insurance benefit plan we can assume that approximately 69% of [CN's] workforce are parents. The methodology used by CN to produce this evidence was severally put to test at the hearing by the Complainant's counsel. But beside the methodological problems, the Tribunal concludes that this very partial evidence falls well short of the evidence that CN would need to produce to justify discrimination on a balance of probabilities using the tripartite Meiorin BFOR test.\n[228] If the Tribunal was to accept CN's argument that because a vast majority of its employees are parents, accommodating the Complainant would cause it undue hardship, that would mean that any workplace with a large number of persons falling into a group with one or the other of the personal characteristics set forth in section 3 of the CHRA would automatically be precluded from the application of the law. For example, it would mean that women working in a workplace where the vast majority of employees are women would be precluded from making a complaint of discrimination based upon gender. Accepting CN's argument would have the effect of making it impossible for an individual to make a complaint on the ground of family status - at least, family status matters that involve parental obligations and responsibilities - because most of the employees in the workforce are parents and could also potentially follow the same route.\n[229] CN did not produce any evidence that it was overwhelmed with requests for accommodation from people in the Complainant's situation. In Grismer, supra, at para. 41, the Supreme Court of Canada stated quite clearly that in the context of accommodation impressionistic evidence of increased expense will not generally suffice. In Lane, supra, at paragraph 117, the Ontario Divisional Court added:\nUndue hardship cannot be established by relying on impressionistic or anecdotal evidence, or after-the-fact justifications. Anticipated hardships caused by proposed accommodations should not be sustained if based only on speculative or unsubstantiated concern that certain adverse consequences might or could result if the claimant is accommodated.\n[230] Regardless of the particular basis for CN's claim that it will suffer undue hardship, it is well established that the undue hardship analysis must be applied in the context of the individual accommodation being requested. As the Supreme Court stated in Grismer, supra, at paragraph 19, accommodation must be incorporated into the standard itself to ensure that each person is assessed according to her or his own personal abilities, instead of being judged against presumed group characteristics which are frequently based on bias and historical prejudice. Accordingly, an employee's individual assessment is an essential step in the accommodation process unless it is in itself an undue hardship for the respondent (See Grismer, at paragraphs 22, 30, 32 and 38; Meiorin, at paragraph 65; Audet v. National Railway, 2006 CHRT 25, at paragraph 61 and Knight v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de l'Outaouais, 2007 CHRT 15, at paragraph 72). Again, this individual assessment was not done in the case of the Complainant.\n[231] In the instant case, CN has failed to provide evidence that accommodating the Complainant would cause undue hardship in terms of costs. The only evidence regarding cost was with respect to the training of Conductors and there was no attempt to relate that evidence to the situation in the present case. We must remember that in order to be found to be undue, the cost of accommodation must be substantial. In Quesnel v. London Educational Health Centre (1995), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/474 (Ont. Bs. Inq.), the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal stated, at paragraph 59: cost would amount to undue hardship only if it would alter the essential nature or substantially affect the viability of the enterprise responsible for the accommodation. This is recognized in CN's own Accommodation policy which states: The costs incurred must be extremely high before the refusal to accommodate can be justified. The burden of justifying the refusal rests with the employer. The cost incurred must be quantifiable and related to the accommodation. Renovations or special equipment can be expensive but financial aid may sometimes be obtained from various organizations. No evidence of this nature was submitted at the hearing.\n(v) Conclusion [232] For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence has established that CN has breached section 7 of the CHRA. CN's practice of requiring the Complainant to protect the shortage in Vancouver has had an adverse effect on her because of her family status. The evidence demonstrates that CN acted contrary to section 7 of the CHRA by pursuing a policy and practice that deprived the Complainant of employment opportunities based upon her family status.\n[233] The evidence also establishes that the Complainant was put at a disadvantage because of her special needs and requirements. CN's managers never met with her. They never allowed her the opportunity to present and explain her needs, nor did they ask any question to fully understand her request. They never sought any advice from their own Human Resources Department. If they had, they would certainly have been told to initiate the policy considering Ms. Ziemer's evidence that the policy is initiated as soon as a employee comes forward and reports a problem or a special need and her evidence that taking care of an ill child, having issues regarding a custody order or being a single parent would at least open the door to discussions.\n[234] Finally, CN has not submitted any evidence that accommodating the Complainant would cause it undue hardship.\nD. REMEDIES [235] The remedies sought by the Complainant are compensation for lost wages and benefits, compensation for pain and suffering, special compensation, legal cost and interest and an order that she be reinstated in her employment with CN with full seniority, benefits and all other opportunities or privileges that were denied to her The CHRC also seeks an order ensuring that CN cease all discriminatory practices and behaviour and that it review its accommodation policy.\n(i) An Order that CN Review its Accommodation Policy [236] The CHRC requests an order, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, that CN take measures, in consultation with the CHRC, to redress its failure to properly accommodate its employees on the basis of family status, including issues of parental obligations and responsibilities. It further requests an order that appropriate human rights training for CN's managerial, human resources and crew management personal be put in place and that regular information sessions on accommodation policies be offered in an effort to eliminate discriminatory attitudes and assumptions related to family status as a ground of discrimination be held.\n[237] Although the Tribunal acknowledges that CN has a good policy on accommodation, it is clear that it has not been applied or implemented properly in the case of family status as a ground of discrimination. Some evidence has also indicated that the policy has not been revised since the Tribunal's decisions in Audet v. Canadian National Railway, [2006] CHRT 25 and Hoyt, supra. At the most, according to the evidence of Cathy Smolynek, CN's Senior Director of Occupational Health Services, some process changes were made in the disability area of the Policy, but nothing else.\n[238] The Tribunal has referred in this decision to the Accommodation Guidelines and has determined that the managers and supervisors have failed to follow this policy in the Complainant's case. Having reviewed the evidence, the Tribunal concludes that CHRC's request is justified.\n[239] The Tribunal therefore orders CN to work with the CHRC to ensure that the discriminatory practice and behaviour does not continue and to make sure:\nthat the appropriate policies, practices and procedures are in place, and that CN, in consultation with the CHRC, retains appropriate persons to conduct workplace training for managers, human resource staff, CMC employees and any other employees deemed necessary on issues of discrimination and human rights and particularly on accommodation on the ground of family status.\n(ii) Reinstatement [240] The Complainant seeks an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, directing CN to return her to her employment as a Conductor. Section 53(2)(b) of the CHRA states that where the Tribunal finds the complaint is substantiated, it may order a respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied the victim as a result of the practice.\n[241] In order to provide this remedy in the present case, the Complainant must therefore be returned to her job without lost of seniority. The Tribunal therefore orders CN to return the Complainant to her position as Conductor at the Jasper terminal, after she has, if necessary, updated her rules and medical certificates.\n[242] There are three possible starting dates that the Tribunal could reasonably fix for the Complainant reinstatement. The first date suggested is July 2nd, 2005, which could be seen as the effective date for implementation of the Complainant's request to be accommodated by being set up in a full time position in Jasper. The Tribunal does not accept this as an appropriate date as there was no evidence that the Complainant could have been set up in a full time position in Jasper at that time or that this would have been the appropriate accommodation had CN followed its Accommodation Policy. There was also no evidence of any employees being set up in Jasper at that time.\n[243] The second date is March 1st, 2006. According to the evidence, this is the date that another laid off employee from Jasper, who had been recalled and had reported to Vancouver, was set up in Jasper. Since only four employees from Jasper, the Complainant, Denise Seeley, Cindy Richards and this other employee, had been recalled and told to report to Vancouver, it might be reasonable to expect that the they would also have been set up in Jasper around March 2006. It is also important to note that the Complainant was the laid off employee with the most seniority in Jasper. Ms. Storms also testified that because the Complainant's seniority is very close to [that of the employee who was set up] it is safe to say that [she] would have been recalled to Jasper at that time as well.\n[244] Finally, evidence was produced that in March 2007, CN hired Conductors in Jasper and that many of these new Conductors have since been set up. It is reasonable to conclude therefore that, considering the fact that the Complainant had seniority over these new Conductors, that she would have been set up in Jasper ahead of them.\n[245] With the admission of Ms. Storms, it is safe to conclude that the Complainant would most likely have been set up in March 2006, had she not been terminated and this date is therefore the one retained for her reinstatement.\n[246] In regards to her seniority, since seniority continues to accumulate even when an employee is on lay off, it will in this case continue to accumulate as if there had never been a breach in her relationship with CN in July, 2005.\n(iii) Compensation for lost wages [247] The Complainant seeks compensation for all wages and benefits lost pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Considering my conclusion as to the date of reinstatement, I order that the Complainant be compensated for all lost wages and benefits from March 1st, 2006 to today. The parties are ordered to calculate the amount of wages owing using the formula provided for in the Collective Agreement. In regards to extra payments that a road Conductor could receive, since it would be difficult for the Tribunal to set an amount, it is ordered that the parties establish this amount by looking at the extras that were paid for the period to a Conductor with similar seniority working in the terminal, assuming that that Conductor had no unusual absences. The parties could, for example, take into consideration the extra payments that were paid to the employee who was set up in Jasper in March 2006.\n[248] According to the Complainant's income tax reports her income for 2006, was $ 7,580. That year she worked as a waitress in a restaurant in Jasper. In January 2007, the restaurant where she worked closed down. On February 2, 2007, she started working at the same lumber yard where Cindy Richards was working. For that year, her income was $22,462. In 2008, her salary at the lumber yard was $27,413. She testified that her income for 2009 will be $14.00 per hour for 36-40 hours per week for a total of $28,000. She receives no other benefits at this job.\n[249] These amounts should therefore be deducted from the amount of her lost wages.\n[250] As to the claim for lost wages from July 2nd, 2005 to March 1st, 2006, there was no evidence that the Complainant would have been working during that period. Even if she would have been allowed to remain on the emergency board, there was no evidence submitted that would allow the Tribunal to set this amount, so the Tribunal makes no order for this period.\n(iv) Pain and suffering [251] Section 53(2) of the CHRA provides for compensation for pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice, up to a maximum of $20,000.\n[252] The Complainant testified that during all the period relevant to this matter she felt desperate and scared. She also testified that she was stressed and very nervous. When she received the call informing her that she was being forced to Vancouver, she did an evaluation of her family situation and came to the conclusion that is was not possible for her to go to Vancouver at this point in her life. When she got the letter informing her that her employment with CN was terminated she said that she cried and panicked. She added that she was shocked and could not believe that this was happening to her. She further testified that the lost of her career affected her deeply.\n[253] Although no medical evidence was produced, the Tribunal concludes that CN's conduct and nonchalant attitude towards her situation was disturbing for the Complainant. Taking this into consideration, the Tribunal orders CN to pay to the complainant $15,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering.\n(v) Willful or Reckless Conduct [254] Section 53(3) of the CHRA provides for additional compensation where the Respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly up to a maximum of $20,000.\n[255] I agree that CN's conduct in this case was reckless. CN had adopted an accommodation policy, which set out the procedures to be followed with respect to any employees who reported a problem or a special need. This policy clearly identified family status as one of the ground for discrimination. Yet, CN and the senior managers involved in this case decided that they needed be concerned with family status and ignored their responsibilities under the policy. They didn't make any efforts to try to understand the Complainant's situations. They ignored her letters and decided to treat her case as just a child care issue. They felt that they knew, without ever speaking to the Complainant, what was better for her and what she needed. This course of action was, in my view, reckless.\n[256] In the circumstances, I order CN to pay to the Complainant the sum of $20,000, in additional compensation under section 53(3) of the Act.\n(vi) Costs and Interest. [257] In her closing arguments, counsel for the Complainant sought an award for legal cost. The question whether the Tribunal has the authority to award costs and whether that authority could be found in paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, which authorizes the Tribunal to compensate a complainant for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice, was dealt with by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. Mowat, 2009 FCA 309.\n[258] After an analysis of Human Rights Code in various provinces that allowed an award for cost and after analysing the purported intent of Parliament, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded at paragraph 95:\nThe quest is to determine whether Parliament intended to endow the Tribunal with the authority to award costs to a successful complainant. For the reasons given, I conclude that Parliament did not intend to grant, and did not grant, to the Tribunal the power to award costs. To conclude that the Tribunal may award legal costs under the guise of expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice would be to introduce indirectly into the Act a power which Parliament did not intend it to have.\n[259] Taking into consideration the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, the Tribunal cannot accede to the Complainant's request that CN be ordered to pay her legal cost.\n[260] The Complainant and Cindy Richards have submitted at the hearing out of pocket expenses which amount to $336.68, each being accountable for half this amount. This amount was not challenged by CN. Under the provision of paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, CN is ordered to reimburse half this amount to the Complainant.\n(vii) Interest [261] In regards to interest, interest is payable in respect of all the awards in this decision (s. 53(4) of the CHRA). The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53 (2)(e) of the CHRA) and the special compensation (s. 53(3)), the interest shall run from the date of the complaint and for the lost of earning it will run from the date of reinstatement.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario September 29, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1354\/8408\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Kasha A.

Introduction [1] This is an employment discrimination case on the basis of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA). Denise Seeley (the Complainant) filed a complaint alleging that the Respondent, the Canadian National Railway (CN) has discriminated against her on the basis of her family status by failing to accommodate her and by terminating her employment.\n[2] CN denies the complainant's allegations.\n[3] All the parties, including the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC), were present at the hearing and were represented by counsel.\n[4] There are two other related complaints against CN. By agreement of the parties, these two other matters were treated in a separate hearing and will be decided separately. Although the facts in the present case and in those two other cases are very similar and that the witnesses for CN were the same, except for one who did not testify in this case, the evidence is, in many regards, different. The witnesses of CN, who testified in this case, did not, without necessarily contradicting themselves, repeat exactly the same evidence in the two other cases. Also, documents which were disclosed in this hearing were not filed as evidence in those two other cases. These differences will explain any discrepancies that may exist in the facts when they are compared.\nA. The Facts (i) The Canadian National Railway a) General information [5] CN is a federally regulated corporation which derives its revenues from the transportation of goods by train. It is a transcontinental railway company which operates in Canada and in the United States. Its freight trains transport goods 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n[6] CN employs more than 15,000 employees in Canada. Employees are organised in two groups described as operating and non-operating. The non-operating group is comprised of employees working in clerical, mechanical and engineering positions. The operating group employees are also known as running trades employees and consist of Conductors and locomotive engineers. CN has over 4,000 running trades employees throughout Canada of which 2,400 are Conductors.\n[7] The Crew Management Centre (CMC) in Edmonton is a very important part of CN operations. CMC is responsible for all the crew calling and deployment for the Western region. They manage the workforce for running trades and also manage a payroll of 204 million dollars. Elaine Storms is the Director of CMC. She occupied this position in 2005.\nb) Running trades employees [8] As stated earlier, locomotive engineers and Conductors form part of what is identified as the running trades' employees. Locomotive engineers operate the engine and Conductors are basically in charge of all the other aspects pertaining to the movement of a train.\n[9] Running trades employees either work road or yard. Road work consists of employees who will get on a train at a particular terminal and take the train to another terminal. They will then layover at the away terminal and come back to their home terminal later. A yard employee would typically work in the yard, switching box cars and making up trains. The yard employee does not leave the terminal.\n[10] In terms of hiring, CN tends to hire its running trades employees in large group. CN did significant hiring in the seventies, a spattering in the eighties; then again it did significant hiring in the nineties and also during the last couple of years.\n[11] Ms. Ziemer, a Human Resources Officer from Vancouver, testified that in 1996 the percentage of women in the running trades was about 3%. This figure was 3.7% in 2006 and is now around 3.1%. She added that men predominantly showed more interest for running trades jobs.\n[12] She also explained that the cost of hiring and training a Conductor would be in the vicinity of 18,000 to 20,000$, per Conductor. The training takes from three (3) to six (6) months. The cost of training a locomotive engineer is between 28,000$ to 30,000$, in addition to what it cost to train him or her as a Conductor.\n[13] In order to be qualified to work as a Conductor, an employee must have his rules and medical cards up to date. These cards have to be updated every three years. If the employee is on the working board, he or she will generally get a notice that tells him or her that his cards are about to expire and then he just needs to make the proper arrangements to bring them up to date. If the employee is on lay off, he will need to take care of this by himself.\n[14] Due to the nature of CN's operation, running trades employees must be able to work where and when required, subject to restrictions imposed by law and the collective agreement. In light of these considerations, CN feels that mobility and flexibility constitutes basic job requirements for running trades employees. It considers these requirements as necessary because of the volume of goods it transports and because of the fluctuation in traffic which can occur over a short time period of time due, for example, to changes in the economy or to seasonal factors such as the grain harvest season.\n[15] When an employee is working or available to work, he is said to be on the working board. The working board includes all employees who are not on lay off. Employees on the working board are either on assignments or in apool.\n[16] An employee who is on the working board can also be said to have been set up. The decision to set up an employee is made following discussions between managers at the terminal where the employees are supposed to be set up and the union. The decision is based on the numbers of employees needed to perform the work that is expected.\n[17] There is also another board, which forms part of the working board, but which is designated as the spare board or emergency board. Employees on this board will only be called to work to fill in when other employees are either on vacation or unavailable to work for any other reasons.\n[18] Running trades employees work on a mileage basis. The working board is adjusted on weekly basis so that each employee can do approximately 4,300 miles a month. When doing the adjustment of the working board, CN will look at the previous week to see how many miles were made by the employees. They will divide this number by 4,300 and the result will indicate the number of employees that would potentially be needed for the following week.\n[19] At all relevant times to this matter, Conductors in the Western Region of Canada were represented by the United Transportation Union (UTU). The Western Region includes all of CN's rail terminals from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Thunder Bay, Ontario. The applicable collective agreement for Conductors in the Western Region is Agreement 4.3 (the Collective Agreement).\nc) The changes made in 1992 and the creation of the furlough boards [20] In 1992, technological changes allowed CN to do away with the car at the tail end of the train, which is more commonly known as the caboose. This decision prompted the elimination of the position of brakeman. After this decision, Conductors, who used to work in the caboose, were moved up to the front of the train with the locomotive engineer. Eliminating the position of brakemen meant that CN needed less running trades' employees to run its trains. The reduction in the number of employees was done through the negotiation process with the Union. The negotiation resulted in the creation of the furlough boards.\n[21] A furlough board comes into existence when there is a surplus of employees, but not enough work for everyone. The furlough board will then guarantee the employee's earnings up to the 4,300 miles provided for in the Collective Agreement whether he or she works or not. The employee on the furlough board has to remain available for work, but if he or she isn't called to go to work, he or she still gets paid his or her salary.\n[22] The changes made to the working conditions in 1992, also created the notion of forcing, which produces different results for different categories of employees in the running trades. According to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement, employees hired subsequent to June 29th, 1990, can be forced to cover work at another terminal in the Western region and are obligated to report at that terminal within, at most thirty (30) days unless they present a satisfactory reason justifying their failure to do so. These employees are commonly referred to as category D employees. They are also referred to as non-protected employees, insofar as they are obligated to respond to a recall outside of their terminal.\n[23] Other categories of employees include those who were hired prior to June 29, 1990. These are referred to as protected employees. In this group of protected employees we have those who were hired prior to 1982 and who are referred to as Category A and Category B employees, respectively. These employees cannot be assigned for work outside of their local terminals. Employees hired after 1982 but prior to June 29, 1990, are referred to as Category C employees and may only be assigned to protect work at adjacent terminals. For example, Category C employees at the Jasper terminal could only be assigned to the adjacent terminals of Edson and Kamloops.\n[24] The status of protected employees represents an exception to the general rule. The number of these employees will diminish over time through simple attrition and the status will eventually disappear altogether. The protected employees also have the benefit of the furlough boards. Non-protected employees are not entitled to the furlough board.\n[25] With the creation of the furlough boards, which in essence allowed some employees to be protected at their home terminal, CN needed to find a way to fill positions in cases of shortages at other locations. This is where section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement came into being. This provision, as we have just seen, allows CN to force unprotected employees to other terminals in the Western region to cover work.\n[26] Prior to the enactment of section 148.11, CN would get employees to cover shortages by issuing what is referred to as a shortage bulletins and allowing employees to bid on these shortages, if they so desired. These bulletins were put out at each change of card which would happen about four times a year. Since it is difficult for CN to predict where a shortage will occur, these bulletins would cover various locations, whether or not there was actually a shortage there. Employees who wished to work at a shortage at a certain location would post a bid for that location and if that location ever became short, the employee who had posted a bid could be called to cover the work there.\n[27] CN still puts out shortage bulletins and employees are still allowed to bid on these, but given that protected employees can now stay at their home terminal on the furlough board and still be paid, there is little incentive for them to bid on these potential shortages.\n[28] CN also used a system which is referred to as the whitemanning which allows it to send a surplus of employees at one terminal to an adjacent terminal. For example, in such a scenario employees in Kamloops, B.C., would be running trains that the Vancouver crews would normally take to Kamloops.\n[29] It is also possible that manager will be called upon during a shortage situation. Almost all of the transportation managers are qualified to operate trains. CN will call upon its managers as a last resort after it has exhausted its supply of running trades employees.\n[30] Employees who are assigned to another terminal pursuant to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement are afforded with certain amenities at their assigned terminal. These include, when available, rooms equipped with kitchenettes and also the possibility of travelling back to their home residence at regular intervals or, alternatively, having CN cover the cost associated with bringing a family member to the shortage location.\n[31] According to subsection 148.11(f) of the Collective Agreement, the first employee called upon to protect work will be the junior qualified employee on lay off in the seniority territory with a seniority date subsequent to June 29, 1990. The collective agreement does not provide for a maximum duration for covering work. If the shortage turns out to be permanent, then CN will proceed to hire people for that location.\n[32] Section 115 of the Collective Agreement provides that an employee who is laid off will be given preference for re-employment when staff is increased in his seniority district and will be returned to service in order of seniority. The provision also provides that if the employee is employed elsewhere at the time of recall, he may be allowed thirty (30) days in which to report. If he fails to report for duty or if he fails to give satisfactory reason for not doing so, within fifteen (15) days of the recall, he will forfeit all his seniority rights.\n[33] An employee, who would wish to raise a satisfactory reason to justify his or her failure to report for work, would first have to make a request to the Crew Management Centre (CMC). He or she would then be instructed to write a letter to his or her immediate supervisor at his home terminal. If the reason raised could have an impact on the Collective Agreement some discussions with the union might be necessary.\n(ii) The Complainant's work history [34] The Complainant was hired by CN as a brakeman on July 2nd, 1991 and she qualified as a freight train Conductor in 1993. Her home terminal was Jasper, Alberta. The Complainant and her husband lived in Jasper until the birth of their first child in 1999. They then moved to Brule, Alberta, a small community located at about ninety-eight (98) kilometres from Jasper. She was an employee of CN until her employment was terminated, in 2005, for refusing to cover the shortage in Vancouver.\n[35] Her husband is also employed by CN as a locomotive engineer with currently 32 years of service.\n[36] The Complainant worked as a Conductor from 1991 to 1997. In 1997, she was laid off, as were many other employees of CN. She remained on layoff from November 1997 until February 2005. However, her employment relationship with CN was maintained throughout her layoff period. The Collective Agreement provides that an employee on lay off will continue to accumulate seniority. It further provides that he or she can stay on lay off indefinitively or until he or she is recalled or resigns.\n[37] Between 1997 and 2001, the Complainant had performed some work for CN on emergency calls. More precisely, she worked twenty-five (25) tours of emergency calls between 1997 and 2000. In 2001, she worked four (4) more tours. She did not work from thereon.\n[38] In January 1999, the couple's first child was born. The second one was born in 2003. Following the birth of her first child, the Complainant still did some emergency work on a few occasions, in Jasper, but the calls being unpredictable, this made it difficult for her to make the necessary child care arrangements. After the birth of her second child, the Complainant did not do any emergency work for CN.\n(iii) The Vancouver shortage [39] In February 2005, CN was experiencing a severe shortage of running trades employees in its Vancouver terminal. This situation was mainly due to a growing economy and an increase in CN's business volume which had outpaced its capacity to provide running trades employees locally. According to Ms. Storms seventy two (72) Conductors were needed in Vancouver to cover the shortage and Vancouver had only fifty three (53) Conductors working. She added that it was definitively one of the most serious shortages that I had seen in my career.\n[40] Due to its location, the Vancouver terminal is a very active one. It includes extensive yard and intermodal operations where goods are transferred from and onto ships. The Vancouver terminal therefore constitutes a focal point for CN's Canadian market as vast amounts of materials and consumer goods shipped to and from Asia and North America transits through it and are afterwards transported throughout Canada on CN's rail network.\n[41] A shortage of running trades employees in Vancouver carries significant implications, as it can affect CN's ability to operate adequately throughout its network.\n[42] In order to maintain its level of operation, CN decided in February 2005 to recall laid off Conductors from the Western region to protect the shortage affecting the Vancouver terminal. These employees were non-protected employees with a seniority date subsequent to June 29, 1990. As such, they were subject to Article 148.11(c) of the Collective Agreement.\n[43] Ms. Storms also testified that during that period she went to Vancouver to help with the deployment of officers. She added that officers had been called in from all over Canada to help with the shortage.\n[44] In terms of how long this shortage might last, Mr. Joe Torchia, the Director of Labour Relation for CN, indicated that it might have been possible to give an estimate, but that they would be reluctant to do so because then people tend to hold you to it. He agreed that the uncertainty regarding the length of the shortage could have an impact on what housing arrangements CN might be willing to agree too. Ms. Storms was more precise and indicated that if the Complainant had reported to Vancouver, she would have probably stayed there for approximately a year, since the shortage situation in Vancouver was not resolved before 2006.\n[45] Employees reporting to cover the shortage at the Vancouver terminal, would be asked to show up at the Thornton Yard, in Surrey, and from there, since Vancouver has a number of yards, they would be taxied to wherever they were needed. Employees would only be informed when they got to Vancouver where they were going to work and what shift they would be working on.\n(iv) The Conductors recalled to cover the Vancouver shortage [46] Forty-seven (47) laid off Conductors were recalled to cover the Vancouver shortage in February 2005. Ms. Storms explained that, in accordance with the Collective Agreement, employees are recalled on a seniority basis, starting with the senior person in the district. She added that CN would not allow a senior employee to bypass an opportunity to work, because that would mean that they were not protecting their seniority. At the time of the recall, the Complainant was third out of four on the seniority list of laid off employees at the Jasper terminal.\n[47] The forty-seven (47) employees were initially contacted by phone. Again according to Ms. Storms, when these employees were called they were told that they had fifteen (15) days to report to cover the shortage.\n[48] CN produced at the hearing a document providing part of the work history for some of these employees. Ms. Storms explained that this document was a result of information entered into the system by crew dispatchers at CMC. She was extensively cross-examined in regards to this document by the Complainant's counsel and by counsel for the CHRC. We will go over this document in some detail in the following paragraphs, as it was apparent that this information was important for all the parties. In order to protect the privacy of these employees, they will be identified by letters which do not correspond to their names.\n[49] The employee identified by the letters AB, although recalled did not report to the Vancouver shortage. On March 22th, 2005, he was set up at the Sioux Lookout terminal. He continued to work there to the end of the year. Having been set up at his home terminal, he did not have to cover the shortage in Vancouver. Although this employee was set up on March 22nd, he only worked on March 24th and then he did not work again until April 1st. After this date he works again on April 10th and 11th, but doesn't work until April 18th. On July 22, he takes a personal leave and doesn't return to work until August 12th. He works from that date to August 20th, but does not work gain before September 22nd. He works again on September 30th and then does not work until October 28th.\n[50] Employee HI was working on a shortage at Hornepayne at the time of the recall. He worked on that shortage up until May 18th, 2005. After that he went home for a week and then went to Vancouver to cover the shortage on May 30th. He was later recalled to his home terminal on September 19th 2005. He took a transfer to Fort Francis on October 29th and worked there until the end of the year.\n[51] According to the documents produced by CN, while he was in Vancouver, this employee started off by doing four (4) shifts of training. After he had completed his training on June 3rd, he only starts working on June 9th, six days later. Ms. Storms specified that it could well be that during that time he was still in training, although she did not know for sure. After June 9th, he is shown as available from June 17th to June 26th and then he is off work for miles. That means that he had been at the shortage location for a specified amount of time and he could go home for a few days. He did not work in Vancouver from June 16th to July 6th. From July 23rd to August 8th he also did not work. Then he has another break on September 1st and his next working date is September 25th. On October 29th, as I've stated earlier, he is set up in Fort-Francis, but does not actually work there before December 22nd, 2005. When asked by the Complainant's counsel why an employee would be set up for almost two months and not work, Ms. Storms replied: I can't answer that.\n[52] Employee P was laid off at North Battleford on February 25th. On March 19th he took a week's vacation and then he was set up at his home terminal on March 26th. As already mentioned, when an employee is set up, he or she is no longer under an obligation to cover a shortage. Ms. Storms did emphasize though that being set up does not mean that the employee is working every day. In the case of employee P, for example, from March 26th to the end of April, he only worked 7 days at his home terminal, but Ms Storms added that we must be careful when looking at this information as those tours can last two (2) or three (3) days each, although no evidence confirming that this was the case was submitted. The employee was again laid off again on April 24th, 2005. From that date to the rest of the year, employee P moved around within the Saskatchewan zone taking a clearance at other terminals.\n[53] The expression taking a clearance refers to the situation where a laid off employee with seniority in the Western region elects to go to another terminal where a position he can hold is available. When a position becomes available at his home terminal, the employee will return there. If an employee is exercising his seniority and takes a clearance, he or she is said to be working and will not have to report to cover a shortage. According to Ms. Storms, this would have been an option for the Complainant. In order to do that, Ms Storms explained that the Complainant would have had to call CMC and inquire where she could take a clearance.\n[54] Employee Y was also called to protect the shortage in Vancouver on February 25th, 2005. On that day he was on a leave of absence, but according to Ms. Storms, CMC would have contacted him within the next few days. Ms. Storms added that she had checked into this employee's work record and that it indicated that he was Absent without Leave on March 4th, 2005 and that his employment was terminated. But then she added, I don't know exactly what the details were, but I believe there was a mistake made and he should have just been shown laid off at that time. Whatever happened, this employee did not go to the shortage and was eventually set up at his home terminal on March 15th, 2005. On April 9th, he was again laid off and then on April 30th, he was given a leave of absence by his trainmaster. Ms. Storms testified that she tried to contact his trainmaster as well as the Superintendent of his Division to see why this employee had been given a leave of absence, but that the trainmaster had retired and the Division had not kept any records of this instance. She also stated that the Superintendent didn't have any recollection of this situation. Ms Storms also added, We had a hard time contacting the employee and quite frankly he was dodging us. He did work the majority of time at his home location. He either worked or was in training or was on a leave of absence for the majority of the shortage. Finally, on December 25th, 2005, this employee was set up in Saskatoon.\n[55] Employee U was called to cover the shortage in Vancouver at the same time as everyone else. Ms. Storms testified that she had personally talked to this employee and had been informed by him that his father was terminally ill. She added that she had then taken it upon herself to extend his time to report. This employee stayed on the laid off board until June 26th 2005, at which time he was given a leave of absence by the trainmaster at his terminal. On July 24th, he was set up at his home terminal. His father passed away in October and he booked off on bereavement. He stayed at his home terminal for the remainder of the year.\n[56] Ms. Storms also testified that initially when they started contacting employees for the shortage, the staff at CMC would just write notes down in their work records as they were making the calls. But, because the shortage was so large, things were getting a little unwieldy and Ms. Storms instructed her staff to put charts together so that they could see where things were and how many people would cover the shortage. The information we find on these charts were gathered and recorded by different employees at CMC. The first chart was produced on March 7th, 2005.\n[57] The entry on this chart for March 16th 2005 for Employee E indicates 15 days to report, 30 requested. G. Spanos pls advise or arrange travel. On April 20th, 2005, the entry shows Per Manitoba Zone [E] has been given a compassionate LOA until further notice - per Ron Smith - due to personal issue. According to Ms. Storms, Ron Smith is the manager of the running trades' employees for the Manitoba zone. Ms. Storms testified that she did recall a little bit about this instance. This situation was very similar to employee U. Employee E had a terminally ill parent as well. On May 19th, 2005, the entry indicates Per Manitoba zone this individual has been given a compassionate [leave of absence] until further notice per A. Nashman and K. Carroll. Mr. Carroll was the general manager of the Vancouver, South Division, and Mr. Nashman was the general manager of the Western Operation Centre. Employee E was on a leave of absence until July 30th, 2005 and afterwards absent without leave from July 31st to September 8th. On September 10th, he is transferred to another terminal (Brandon, Manitoba) and finally he resigned on October 19th.\n(v) The Complainant's recall to work [58] On February 25th, 2005, the Complainant received a phone call from an unidentified employee of the CMC, in Edmonton. This employee asked her: If CN were to set you up, how long would you take to report to duty? She replied that that really depended on whether she was being set up in Jasper or if she was going to be forced somewhere else. According to her recollection, as she wrote it in a letter dated March 4th, 2005, addressed to C. Pizziol, the Trainmaster at the Jasper terminal, the CMC employee answered that it did not look likely that she would be forced anywhere as all terminals were short, including Jasper. In that case she figured that she would probably need a couple of weeks to figure out some sort of child care arrangement for her two children. This evidence of the Complainant was not challenged by CN.\n[59] No other employee from CMC, other that the Director, Elaine Storms, was called as a witness. Elaine Storms was not privy to this conversation between the Complainant and the unidentified CMC employee.\n[60] The next day, on February 26, 2005, Joe Lyons, the Manager Operations, Crew Management Centre, Western Operations, spoke on the telephone with the Complainant's husband. He informed him that the Complainant was being forced to Vancouver to cover a shortage under the provisions of the collective agreement.\n[61] Joe Lyons, who used to work under Ms. Storms, was not called as a witness. Besides the fact that he no longer works for CN, no other explanation was given for his absence.\n[62] CN also produced at the hearing a letter from Joe Lyons to the Complainant dated February 28th, 2005, which states: Further to our telephone call on February 25, 2005, recalling you to CN you are recalled to the working board effective immediately as per the provisions of Article 115 of Agreement 4.3. There is also a shortage at Vancouver which requires the Company to invoke the provisions of Article 89.10 and 148.11(c) of Agreement 4.3. This Article provides that non protected employees are required to protect work over the seniority territory. In keeping with this Article you are required to protect the shortage of Yard employees at Vancouver. The Complainant testified that she never received this letter. This letter had been mailed to the Complainant's former address in Jasper where she no longer resided.\n[63] The Complainant explained that before the recall of 2005, she had never refused being forced to another location, but her family status had now changed making it a more difficult option for her. In her March 4th, 2005, letter to Mr. Pizziol she explained I am in a very difficult situation. I have 2 children: one aged 6 enrolled in kindergarten in a french immersion school in Hinton, the other is 21 months old. We live in a hamlet, Brule, of less than 180 people situated nearly 40 km from Hinton. We have no immediate family nearby to help with the children. There is no registered daycare in Brule. There is a daycare in Hinton, however they only have standard business hours. My husband is also a railroader who as you know is required to work around the clock and may be gone anywhere from 15 to 24 hours. Consequently, she requested a 30 day extension to explore any options that may exist.\n[64] Mr. Pizziol never replied to this letter. Mr. Pizziol was not called as a witness at the hearing and no explanation other than the fact that he does not work for CN anymore, was given for his absence.\n[65] On March 7th, 2005, the Complainant made a follow-up call to Mr. Pizziol and left a voice-mail message explaining her family situation and the difficulties related to childcare. On that same day, she also wrote to the Local Chairperson of the UTU informing him of the letter she had sent to her supervisor requesting the thirty (30) day extension, She also added this is a troublesome situation for me and I don't have many option due to my young family, [my husband] railroad career and where we live.\n[66] On March 26th, 2005, she again wrote to Mr. Pizziol asking him to consider her family situation. She repeated what she had written in her earlier letter, informing him that it would be difficult to take her children with her to Vancouver and that because of childcare responsibilities, neither was it feasible to leave them with their father whose own work obligations would cause the same difficulties with childcare. She also requested that her situation be considered on a compassionate basis under the collective agreement and that she be allowed to wait out until Vancouver no longer required her services or until there was work available at the Jasper terminal or at the adjacent terminal in Edson. A copy of this letter was also sent to Ms. Storms. The Complainant did not receive an answer to this letter.\n[67] Ms. Storms testified that she did not specifically recall this letter. She added that if she did receive the letter, and knowing that Mr. Lyon was helming the file, she would have forwarded it to him.\n[68] The last paragraph of that letter stated: I can't possibly be expected to put my family through upheaval to move them for an undetermined length of time at a whim. Employees with restrictive medical conditions have in the past been accommodated to hold regular yard jobs i.e. diabetics when their seniority would not permit other work in the terminal instead of forcing them to relocate to where they could hold. Is it reasonable to ask the same considerations for parents of young children if they demonstrate the need and then she goes on I'm asking you to consider my situation on a compassionate basis. On cross examination, counsel for the Complainant asked Ms. Storms if that had indicated to her that the Complainant was seeking accommodation regarding her family status. Ms. Storms answered: No. I wouldn't have thought about it like that. When you are looking for a leave of absence, you go to your own supervisor. He may have conferred with Human Resources who look after that type of things. Most of our employees or a good deal of our employees have children and it was not a common consideration to request to be excused from protecting shortages. I would have expected Mr. Pizziol to contact Human Resources about this kind of thing. (The emphasis is mine.) No evidence that Mr. Pizziol contacted Human Resources regarding the Complainant's situation was produced at the hearing.\n[69] On March 29th, 2005, the Complainant wrote to Joe Lyons, copying both Mr. Pizziol and Ms. Storms. In this letter she wrote that she had not receive notification in writing informing her that she was being forced to protect the shortage in Vancouver, although other employees in Jasper had received such notification. On that same day, she also sent a letter to Ms. Storms requesting her to reconsider her situation.\n[70] Joe Lyon wrote to the Complainant on March 30th, 2005. In this letter, he informed the Complainant that her request for a thirty (30) extension had been authorised and that the date at which she would be expected to report to Vancouver was moved to March 29th. The Complainant testified that she never received that letter. The letter also makes reference to a telephone conversation of March 30th, 2005 between the Complainant and Joe Lyons. The Complainant testified that she had no recollection of a telephone conversation on that date.\n[71] On April 27th, 2005, Joe Lyon again wrote a letter to the Complainant informing her that CN had accommodated her need for additional time to consider her options and make the necessary child-care arrangements. The letter went on to state that while CN recognizes that her child-care [issues] are important personal responsibility her obligation to CN is to manage those personal obligations in such a way that you are able to fulfill your employment and collective agreement obligations. The Complainant testified that she never received this letter. The address on the letter was not the correct address. CN acknowledged that the letter had been returned to the CMC stamped unclaimed by Post Canada and had not been remailed to the Complainant.\n[72] In her letter of March 4th 2005, the Complainant had requested a thirty (30) extension to report for work. According to CN, the Collective Agreement allows for such an extension when an employee is employed elsewhere at the time they are notified to report for work. This was not the case for the Complainant. Notwithstanding the provision of the collective agreement, during a meeting in May 2005, between officers of CN and officers of UTU, CN advised the union that it would extend the time period for the Complainant to report for work until June 30th, 2005.\n[73] Mr. Torchia testified on cross-examination that he had had discussion, sometime in May 2005, with the General Chairperson of UTU regarding the possibility of extending the time the Complainant had to report to cover the shortage. These discussions took place in Edmonton during a meeting where various topics were on the agenda. He added that he does not recall if he took any notes during this meeting or if any memos or emails were thereafter prepared. He further testified that he was the decision maker in regards to whether or not the extension would be granted.\n[74] On June 20th, 2005, L. Gallegos, Manager Operations. Crew Management, Western Operations Centre, who had by then replaced Mr. Lyons, wrote to the Complainant indicating that CN had accommodated her needs for additional time to consider her options and make the necessary child-care arrangements. CN requested that the Complainant advise it by June 30th, 2005, whether or not she would report for duty to cover the shortage in Vancouver and it further informed her that her failure to do so would result in her forfeiting her seniority and her employment being terminated in accordance with the terms of Article 148.11 of the collective agreement. The letter added:\nWhile the Company recognizes that your child care is an important personal responsibility, you must also acknowledge that your obligation to CN is to manage these personal obligations in such a way that you are also able to fulfill your employment and collective agreement obligations.\n[75] On June 27th, 2005, the Complainant received another letter from Mrs. Gallegos informing her that her failure to report to Vancouver by that day, would result in her forfeiting her seniority rights and her services with the company being dispensed with at noon on July 2nd 2005, in accordance with the provision of the collective agreement.\n[76] Ms. Gallegos was not called as a witness at the hearing and no explanation for her absence was given.\n[77] On June 27th, 2005, the Complainant wrote a letter to Ms. Gallegos in which she states:\nYou have not addressed my previous letter dated March 26\/05 which clearly states my position and my request to CN that would alleviate this situation. I did not request additional time to make necessary child-care arrangements as your letter implies. Your letter also implied I have not provided a response to the Company of whether or not I will be reporting for work in Vancouver. I provided a response in a letter dated March 26 to CN Supervisor (Jasper) C. Pizziol.\nE. Storms also received from me a copy of a letter I addressed to J. Lyons, requesting to receive notice of recall that was sent out to other employees affected. I have since been waiting for a decision or response to my requests and to date have not received any. The only correspondence I have received is your letter threatening to terminate my employment with the Company. My correspondence is being ignored by CMC management and treated as if it does not exist. This refusal to acknowledge my requests, the persistent phone calls stating I must report for duty or lose my seniority, and the run-around I am receiving is harassment and I ask that it stops.\nSince the time I sent these letters in March, shortly after my medical with Medisys, I suffered a spinal injury resulting in a fractured vertebra and am still in a recovery process. I cannot work anywhere at this time. I did not inform Crew Management, as I was waiting to hear back from the Company with a decision whether or not to honour my request that would allow me to remain in laid-off status for compassionate reasons.\nAs I have again responded in a timely manner before the latest deadline you have imposed I hope you will do the same and I ask that you relinquish the deadline until you have informed me in writing of your decision based on my request for a compassionate allowance.\nIn the meantime, I am medically unable to report for duty and upon hearing from you I can provide a medical report to verify my injury.\n[78] The Complainant did not receive a response to this letter.\n[79] On July 4th, 2005, Ms. Gallegos informed the Complainant that her seniority rights had been forfeited and her employment terminated because she had failed to cover the shortage in Vancouver. The Complainant's union filed a grievance on her behalf challenging the decision to terminate her employment. The grievance was never processed to the hearing stage.\n[80] Ms. Storms testified that the manager of the division is the primary decision maker in terms of granting or not an employee's request to be relieved from reporting to a shortage. He would take the persons situation into account and decide what to do with it. He has the power to either grant a leave of absence or an extension of the delay to report. She added that in the case of a large shortage, like the one occurring in Vancouver in 2005, the manager would also discuss the situation with his general manager. In 2005, the general manager to whom Mr. Pizziol, the trainmaster in Jasper, reported was Denis Broshko.\n[81] Mr. Broshko was not called as a witness and no explanation was given for his absence. There was also no evidence submitted by CN indicating that Mr. Pizziol had actually discussed the Complainant's situation with Mr. Broshko.\n[82] Ms. Storms also indicated that it was not the norm for CMC to grant extension of time to report, but she added that there had been odd times where she had decided to extend time in concert with the division. For example, in the case of the employee whose father was terminally ill, she said that she had spoken to the employee and had made the decision to grant him a further extension of fifteen (15) days. After the expiry of the fifteen (15) days extension this employee remained on layoff status and later on he was given a further leave of absence of a few months by his division.\n[83] As we've seen earlier, in her letter of June 27th, 2005, the Complainant had informed her employer that in April 2005, she had suffered an injury while horseback riding and that while she was in the recovery process she could not report to the shortage in Vancouver. After it received this information, CN sought more details regarding her medical condition. It was also seeking advice from its medical department regarding the significance and the implications of her injuries. On February 27th, 2006, CN wrote a letter to the Complainant informing her that it had committed to review your case with the Union including the potential for reinstatement if in fact your medical evidence supports your inability to respond for work in February 2005. It must be clearly understood that any consideration of reinstatement will of course include the fact you must protect all work at CN within the terms and conditions of your Collective Agreement. The Complainant testified that she did not respond to this letter, because by this time she had fully recovered from her accident and no medical condition prevented her from working.\nB. ISSUES [84] The issue raised in this case is as follows: has CN discriminated against the Complainant in the context of employment contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA by failing to accommodate her and by terminating her employment on the ground of family status.\nC. THE LAW AND THEORY OF THE CASE (i) The relevant provisions of the CHRA [85] Section 3 of the CHRA states that family status is a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(The emphasis is mine.)\n[86] For its part, section 7 states:\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\nto refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, , par des moyens directs ou indirects;\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[87] Section 10 of the Act provides:\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\nto establish or pursue a policy or practice, or to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, l'association patronale or l'organisation syndicale;\nde fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite; de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n[88] In considering sections 7 and 10, it is important to highlight the purpose of the CHRA as stated in section 2:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de completer la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[89] The Supreme Court of Canada and other Courts have consistently told us to interpret human rights in a large and liberal manner. In CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, the Court stated, at paragraph 24 :\n24. Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n(ii) The Law a) The prima facie case [90] The initial onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. (See Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons - Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558.)\n[91] Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he or she is entitled to relief in absence of a justification by the respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 208.) In order to prove a prima facie case of discrimination, the Complainant must establish that she was treated in an adverse differential manner and was terminated because of her family status, contrary to section 7 of the CHRA.\nb) What approach is to be applied to determine whether there has been discrimination on the ground of family status? [92] The evaluation of whether there is discrimination on the ground of family status is carried out according to the test set out in Public Service Labour Relations Commission v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin), just as it would be for any other prohibited ground of discrimination. However, in recent years, the interpretation of the notion of family status has led to the creation of two distinct schools of thought. Some cases have adopted a broad approach towards the scope of family status, while other have taken a more narrow approach. In order to better understand what is included in the notion of family status we will review a certain number of these cases.\n[93] In Schaap v. Canada (Dept. of National Defence) [1988] C.H.R.D. No. 4, the Tribunal was considering whether relationships formed in a common-law relationship as opposed to those in a legal marriage fell within the protected groups of marital status and family status. In its decision the Tribunal found the need for a blood or legal relationship to exist and defined family status as including both blood relationships between parent and child and the inter-relationship that arises from bonds of marriage, consanguinity or legal adoption, including, of course, the ancestral relationship, whether legitimate, illegitimate or by adoption, as well as the relationships between spouses, siblings, in-laws, uncles or aunts and nephews or nieces. In Lang v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission, [1990] C.H.R.D. No. 8, the Tribunal stated at page 3: The Tribunal is of the view that the words family status include the relationship of parent and child.\n[94] In Brown v. Department of National Revenue (Customs and Excise), (1993) T.D. 7\/93, the Tribunal held at pages 15 and 20:\nWith respect to ground (b) [family status], the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer.\n[...]\nIt is not suggested by counsel for the Complainant that the employer is responsible for the care and nurturing of a child. She was advocating however that there was a balance of interest and obligation as set out in s. 2 and 7(b) of the C.H.R.A. which must be recognized within the context of family status.\nA parent must therefore carefully weigh and evaluate how they are best able to discharge their obligations as well as their duties and obligations within the family. They are therefore under an obligation to seek accommodation from the employer so that they can best serve those interests.\nWe can therefore understand the obvious dilemma facing the modern family wherein the present socio-economic trends find both parents in the work environment, often with different rules and requirements. More often than not, we find the natural nurturing demands upon the female parent place her invariably in the position wherein she is required to strike this fine balance between family needs and employment requirements.\n[95] The Tribunal finally concluded that the purposive interpretation to be affixed to the CHRA was a clear recognition that within the context of family status it is a parent's right and duty to strike that balance coupled with a clear duty on the part of the employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance within the criteria set out by the jurisprudence. The Tribunal added that to consider any lesser approach to the problems facing the modern family within the employment environment is to render meaningless the concept of family status as a ground of discrimination.\n[96] The Tribunal also considered family status as a ground of discrimination in Hoyt v. Canadian National Railway, [2006] C.H.R.D. No. 33. In this decision, the Tribunal referred to a judicial definition of the term family status, as well as to prior decisions of the Tribunal which set forth requirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on that ground. The Tribunal specifically stated :\n117 Discrimination on this ground has been judicially defined as ... practices or attitudes which have the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic relating to their ... family. (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Mr. A et al [2000] O.J. No. 4275 (C.A.); affirmed [2002] S.C.J. No. 67].\n118 This Tribunal has considered the evidentiary requirements to establish a prima facie case in a decision that predates the Ontario case, though is clearly consistent with its definition:\n... the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer (Brown v. Canada (Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise) [1993] C.H.R.D. No. 7, at p. 13. See also Woiden et al v. Dan Lynn, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 18, T.D. 09\/02)\n[97] However, a different enunciation of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case was articulated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. No. 922, at paragraphs 38 and 39, a decision on which CN put a lot of weight during its closing arguments. In that decision the British Columbia Court of Appeal decided that the parameters of family status as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Human Rights Code of British Columbia should not be drawn too broadly or it would have the potential to cause disruption and great mischief' in the workplace. The Court directed that a prima facie case is made out when a change in a term or condition of employment imposed by an employer results in serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation of the employee. (The underlining is mine.) Low, J.A. observed that the prima facie case would be difficult to make out in cases of conflict between work requirements and family obligations.\n[98] In Hoyt, this Tribunal did not follow the approach suggested in the Campbell River case. The Tribunal summarized its position in regards to that case as follows:\n120 With respect, I do not agree with the [British Columbia Court of Appeal's] analysis. Human rights codes, because of their status as fundamental law, must be interpreted liberally so that they may better fulfill their objectives (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at p. 547, Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at pp. 1134-1136; Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board) [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at pp. 89-90). It would, in my view, be inappropriate to select out one prohibited ground of discrimination for a more restrictive definition.\n121 In my respectful opinion, the concerns identified by the Court of Appeal, being serious workplace disruption and great mischief, might be proper matters for consideration in the Meiorin analysis and in particular the third branch of the analysis, being reasonable necessity. When evaluating the magnitude of hardship, an accommodation might give rise to matters such as serious disruption in the workplace, and serious impact on employee morale are appropriate considerations (see Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489 at pp. 520 - 521). Undue hardship is to be proven by the employer on a case by case basis. A mere apprehension that undue hardship would result is not a proper reason, in my respectful opinion, to obviate the analysis. (The underlining is mine.)\n[99] In addition to the compelling logic of the Tribunal's decision in Hoyt for not following the approach in Campbell River, this Tribunal concludes that the approach suggested in that case imposes an additional burden on the Complainant by suggesting that the protected ground of family status includes proof of a serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation and that this is inconsistent with the purpose of the CHRA. As the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 403, at para. 56, it is not appropriate, when interpreting human rights statutes, to impose additional burdens.\n[100] The Tribunal's approach in Hoyt was cited by the Federal Court of Canada in Johnstone v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J. No. 43, at paragraphs 29-30. This was an application for judicial review by Ms. Johnstone of the decision of the CHRC to not refer her complaint alleging family status discrimination to the Tribunal.\n[101] In Johnstone, the Federal Court agreed with the approach of the Tribunal in Hoyt in regards to discrimination on the basis of family status, and stated that ...there is no obvious justification for relegating this type of discrimination to a secondary or less compelling status. (Johnstone, supra, at para. 29). The Court also stated that the suggestion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the Campbell River case that prima facie discrimination will only arise where the employer changes the conditions of employment seems to be unworkable and, with respect, wrong in law. (Johnstone, supra, at para.29). The Court also found that the serious interference test which the Court viewed as the approach apparently adopted by the CHRC for not sending the matter to the Tribunal, fail[ed] to conform with other binding authorities which have clearly established the test for a finding of prima facie discrimination. (Johnstone, supra, at para. 30.)\n[102] The Federal Court's decision in Johnstone was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, although the Court of Appeal stated that it was not expressing an opinion on the proper version of the test in relation to prima facie discrimination on the ground of family status. Instead the Federal Court of Appeal based its reasoning on the finding that the failure of the CHRC to clearly identify the test it applied was a valid basis for finding the decision of the Commission to be unreasonable. ([2008] F.C.J. No. 427, at para. 2).\n[103] The Tribunal has recently rendered its decision in the Johnstone matter (see Johnstone v. Canada Border Services, 2010 CHRT 20). In that decision the Tribunal held:\n[220] This Tribunal agrees that not every tension that arises in the context of work-life balance can or should be addressed by human rights jurisprudence, but this is not the argument put forward in the present case. Ms. Johnstone's argument is that such protection should be given where appropriate and reasonable given the circumstances as presented.\n[221] As discussed above, we are addressing here a real parent to young children obligation and a substantial impact on that parent's ability to meet that obligation. It is not before this Tribunal to address any and all family obligations and any and all conflict between an employee's work and those obligations.\n[...]\n[230] [...] this Tribunal finds nothing in Section 2 that creates a restrictive and narrow interpretation of `family status'.\n[231] To the contrary, the underlying purpose of the Act as stated is to provide all individuals a mechanism to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society... It is reasonable that protections so afforded include those naturally arising from one of the most fundamental societal relationships that exists, that of parent to child. The fact that the language of Section 2 mentions lives that they are able and wish to have carries with it the acknowledgement that individuals do make separate choices, including to have children, and that the Act affords protection against discrimination with respect to those choices.\n[...]\n[233] This Tribunal finds that the freedom to choose to become a parent is so vital that it should not be constrained by the fear of discriminatory consequences. As a society, Canada should recognize this fundamental freedom and support that choice wherever possible. For the employer, this means assessing situations such as Ms. Johnstone's on an individual basis and working together with her to create a workable solution that balances her parental obligations with her work opportunities, short of undue hardship.\n[104] Recently the Public Service Staffing Tribunal (the PSST) considered whether to follow the approach to family status set out in Hoyt or in Campbell River and determined that it would apply the Hoyt approach. In Chantal Rajotte v. The President of the Canada Border Services Agency et al, 2009 PSST 0025, the PSST stated that the proper approach to be followed is the one set out in Hoyt which is also recognized by the Federal Court in Johnstone. (para. 127.) The PSST further stated:\nAccordingly, the evidence must demonstrate that the complainant is a parent, that she has duties and obligations as a member of society, and further that she was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with the respondent's conduct, the complainant must prove she was unable to participate equally and fully in employment. (para 127.)\n[105] A review of some recent cases out of the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal (the BCHRT) demonstrates that the decisions of that Tribunal are not consistently following the approach in Campbell River. For example, it has not been found to be applicable in the case of provision of services (Stephenson v. Sooke Lake Modular Home Co-operative Association, 2007 BCHRT 341). It has also been distinguished in two BCHRT decisions involving an employment situation (Haggerty v. Kamloops Society for Community Living, [2008] BCHRT 172, par. 17 and Mahdi v. Hertz Canada Limited, [2008] BCHRT 245, paras. 60 and 61).\n[106] In Falardeau v. Ferguson Moving (1990) Ltd., dba Ferguson Moving and Storage et al., 2009 BCHRT 272, the BCHRT referred to the Campbell River, Hoyt and Johnstone decisions, and also to another of its decision in Miller v. BCTF (No. 2), 2009 BCHRT 34. The BCHRT pointed out that in Miller, it had stated that Campbell River applied only in the context from which it arose. It cited the following statement from Miller: The [Campbell River] formulation of what is necessary to establish discrimination on the basis of family status in the context of competing employment and family obligations is not applied mechanically in all cases of alleged discrimination on the basis of family status. (Falardeau, at para. 29.)\n[107] The issue in Falardeau concerned whether an employee, who had refused to do overtime because of child care responsibilities for his son, had been discriminated against on the ground of family status. The Tribunal found that the complainant had not established a prima facie case. The Tribunal stated at paras 31 and 32:\nIn the present case, Ferguson sought to maintain a well-established pattern of overtime hours to meet the needs of its customers. To the extent Mr. Falardeau made the respondents aware of his child-care needs and arrangements, they thought, correctly on the evidence before me, that he was readily able to obtain coverage for his son's care if his work hours were extended. Indeed, he had done so on many occasions. The fact that neither the pattern of Mr. Falardeau's work, nor his childcare demands or arrangements had changed, suggests that he may have made an issue of overtime because of his dislike of work on construction sites, rather than because of his family responsibilities.\nThere was no evidence that his son had any special needs, or that Mr. Falardeau was uniquely qualified to care for him. Although these factors are not required to establish a substantial parental obligation, the evidence in this case established no other factors which would take Mr. Falardeau's case out of the ordinary obligations of parents who must juggle the demands of their employment, and the provision of appropriate care to their children. I am unable on these facts to find a serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation. (The underlining is mine.)\n[108] The BCHRT in Falardeau was essentially following the reasoning formulated in the Campbell River case. But even if it had followed the Hoyt approach, its conclusion might not have been different. The main difference between the situation in Falardeau and in the present case is that in Falardeau there had been no changes in Mr. Falardeau pattern of work or in his childcare demands or arrangements. Furthermore, his employer had been made aware of Mr. Falardeau's child-care needs and arrangements and it thought, rightly, that Falardeau was readily able to obtain coverage for his son's care if his work hours were extended. Therefore, Mr. Falardeau had not been able to make out a prima facie case on the ground of family status, as he had not proven that he was unable to participate equally and fully in employment as a consequence of his duties and obligations as a parent.\n[109] In the present case, the Complainant by being forced to cover a shortage in Vancouver was facing a serious interference with her parental duties and obligations. The matter might have been different had the Complainant refused to be set up at her home terminal.\n[110] In his closing arguments CN's counsel argued that the Complainant's position was based on an incorrect premise. He qualified the complaint as a request that the employer accommodate the Complainant's parental preferences and lifestyle choices. He added that this position was based on an exceedingly broad interpretation of the CHRA and that the only characteristic raised by the Complainant as triggering protection under the Act is the fact that she is a parent and as such must see to the upbringing of her children. Counsel further submitted that requiring an employee who is a parent to comply with his or her responsibility to report to work as required by the collective agreement does not amount to discrimination prima facie. Rather, he argued that the refusal by an employee to comply with his or her responsibilities in this regard amounts to a choice which is exclusively personal in nature and which, absent exceptional circumstances, no employer is obligated to accommodate. Accordingly, he concluded that upholding the complaint in this case would amount to adding parental preferences to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in the CHRA under the guise of an expansion of the notion of family status.\n[111] In support of his arguments, Counsel referred to numerous cases and awards, including the British Columbia's Court of Appeal decision in Campbell River which he suggested presented a more structured and pragmatic approach than the Tribunal's decision in Hoyt. He also made reference to an arbitration award in Canadian Staff Union v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, (2006) 88 C.L.A.S. 212. In this case, the grievor had refused to relocate to Halifax after having applied for a job which indicated that the place of work would be Halifax. The grievor resided in St. John's, Newfoundland where he had shared custody of his children with his former spouse. He also was responsible for the care of his aging mother. The union argued that the notion of family status was not limited to the status of being a parent per se, but also extended to the accommodation of the grievor's family responsibilities.\n[112] The award stated that the grievance raised important issues of human rights law which were summarized as follows: whether an employer's designation of a specific geographic location in a job posting, and insistence that an employee who wished to hold that job live where he or she can report regularly to work at that location prima facie constitutes discrimination on the basis of marital status or family status, if the employee's marital and family responsibilities effectively preclude him or her from living where he or she can report regularly to work at the specified location. (at para. 6.)\n[113] The arbitrator dismissed the grievance on the ground that for the purposes of any statute relevant here, and the Collective Agreement, it was the Grievor's choice, not his marital and family responsibilities, that precluded him from moving to Halifax. (at para. 9.) The arbitrator added: what the Employer did here did not constitute prima facie discrimination on the basis of marital status or family status and the Employer was not required by law to accommodate the Grievor to the point of undue hardship.\n[114] In his analysis of the relevant cases, the arbitrator adopted the narrower approach of Campbell River in regards to the interpretation of family status. Although interesting, the Tribunal notes that the facts relevant to this award are in many regards different from those in the present case. In that case, the grievor had applied for a job, knowing full well that the job description indicated that it was to be located in Halifax. The grievor had a choice, he could decline to go to Halifax and remain in his position in St. John's, which is not the case for the Complainant whose choice was either to report to Vancouver for an undetermined amount of time or see her employment relationship terminated. The facts also indicate that there was no significant increase in pay or benefits involved between the job in Halifax and the one in St. John's and that the grievor had applied for the job posted because he wanted a change and new challenges (para. 15). The Tribunal also notes that the grievor's children were 19 years old, starting university, and 15, starting high school, and, as indicated by the arbitrator, although the grievor's sons undoubtedly benefited greatly from his regular presence in St. John's, they required no special care from him, and he could make arrangement for their maintenance in his absence. (Para. 141.)\n[115] CN counsel also made reference to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal's decision in Wight v. Ontario (No 2), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/191, which dealt with an employee who, at the expiry of her maternity leave, refused to return to work claiming that she was unable to make appropriate daycare arrangements. Her employment was thereafter terminated on the ground that she had abandoned her position. In this case the Tribunal found that the Complainant had steadfastly refused to acknowledge her employer's reasonable expectations that she would take whatever steps are necessary to return to work when her maternity leave would expire. In the Tribunal words: She had decided she was going to be on a maternity leave until October at the earliest or January at the latest. (para. 321). The Tribunal added that this was not a case of someone who, despite her best efforts, could not find day care for her child and had to make a choice between her child and her job. Again a factual situation which is very different from the present one.\n[116] Counsel also made reference to Smith v. Canadian National Railway, 2008 CHRT 15, a decision rendered in May 2008, by the then Tribunal Chairperson. The Tribunal fails to see how this decision can be said to be comparable to the present situation. In the Smith case, although the complainant did assert, amongst other grounds, that he had been discriminated against on the basis of family status, the Tribunal found that this ground of discrimination had not been raised in the complaint and that no jurisprudence was presented as to whether the facts amounted to family status discrimination. (para. 289.)\n[117] CN's counsel finally referred the Tribunal to a series of awards rendered by the Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration (CROA). Although interesting, all the CROA decisions are founded on their particular facts and do not help us in the determination of the proper test to follow in this case.\n[118] The Tribunal also disagrees with CN's argument that an open-ended concept of family status would open up the floodgates and that it would have the potential of causing disruption and great mischief in the workplace. As the Human Rights and Citizenship Commission of Alberta noted at para. 242 of its decision in Rawleigh v. Canada Safeway Ltd, decision rendered on September 29, 20009, every case must be weighed on its own merits and unique circumstances. To support the belief that the floodgate may be opened to opportunistic individuals is very dangerous and possibly discriminatory.\n[119] The Tribunal also wished to remind that the Supreme Court of Canada and other Courts have consistently held that that human rights must be interpreted in a large and liberal manner. In CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, the Court stated, at paragraph 24 :\n24. Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n[120] From the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that there are two different interpretations in the case law with regard to a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status: the one in Campbell River and the one in Hoyt. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the effect of the approach in Campbell River is to impose a hierarchy of grounds of discrimination, some grounds, as the ground of family status, being deemed less important than others. This approach is not supported by the purpose of the CHRA. Furthermore, all the permutations of the approach applied to the ground of family status in British Columbia subsequent to the Campbell River decision, support the Tribunal's conclusion that family status should not be singled out for a different and more onerous or more stringent prima facie standard. The only solution is to apply the same test as for the other grounds enumerated in section 3 of the CHRA. This approach was accepted in Hoyt and approved by the Federal Court in Johnstone.\n[121] I will therefore follow the approach in Hoyt which is consistent with human rights principles in treating all prohibited grounds of discrimination as equal.\n[122] Furthermore, taking into account the special nature and status of human rights legislation as a quasi-constitutional legislation, the Tribunal concludes that the interpretation and application of family status proposed in Hoyt is the proper one to adopt. As stated earlier, human rights legislation must be given a liberal and purposive interpretation, in which protected rights receive a broad interpretation, while exceptions and defenses are narrowly construed.\nc) Has a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status been made out? [123] In 2005, the Complainant was the parent of two young children. The evidence also establishes that she told CN that a temporary move to Vancouver, with no information with regard to how long she would have to stay there or about the housing arrangements once she arrived there, would disrupt her children's care and that it would be impossible for her to make arrangements for appropriate child care. In addition, her husband was also a railroader with long absences and unpredictable schedules. She had indicated that as long as she was able to work out of her home terminal in Jasper, she could manage to find child care, although, she added, with difficulty.\n[124] In her various letters to CN, the Complainant explained her family situation, but she never received any answer. CN's witnesses testified that parental responsibilities such as child care were not a satisfactory reason not to protect a shortage. CN considered that the Complainant's situation did not qualify as requiring accommodation on the basis of family status under the CHRA. It also considered the Complainant's situation as a personal choice not to abide by her professional obligations in order to prioritize other aspects of her life, a situation it referred to as work-life balance.\n[125] The Tribunal concludes that the law simply does not support CN's view of family status as not including the Complainant's situation. The Complainant's situation as a parent of two small children and the ramifications, as she explained in her various letters, of ordering her to Vancouver does bring her within the ground of family status. She specifically requested accommodation of CN and had directed her request to the right CN officials. CN's witnesses recognized that such a request should be made to the employee's supervisor who in this case was Colin Pizziol, the trainmaster in Jasper. The Complainant had addressed her letters to him. Unfortunately, Mr. Pizziol was not called as a witness and CN's other witnesses could not testified to how he had dealt with this request. The unchallenged evidence of the Complainant was that neither her supervisor, nor any other managers of CN, had ever responded to her letters, nor discussed with her situation.\n[126] Having regard to the evidence submitted at the hearing, the Tribunal concludes that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination based on the ground of family status. The evidence demonstrates that the Complainant was a parent and that her status included the duties and obligations generally incurred by parents. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, the Complainant, because of CN's rules and practices, was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with CN. This being the case, the onus now shifts to CN to demonstrate that the prima facie discriminatory standard or action it adopted is a bona fide occupational requirement.\nd) Did CN provide accommodation to the Complainant? [127] The burden to demonstrate accommodation to the point of undue hardship is that of the employer.\n[128] Because of her family situation, the Complainant asked for accommodation. CN did not provide her with accommodation, except that they did accept to extend the time she had to report to cover the shortage in Vancouver for about 4 months. According to CN's witnesses this accommodation was granted to allow her to make the necessary child care arrangements. It is surprising to see the term accommodation used, as none of CN witnesses felt that they were under an obligation to offer accommodation to the Complainant or that the CHRA applied to her situation. CN's position was that the Complainant had to make a choice between her job and her family situation and that was that. Mr. Kerry Morris, CN's Labour Relation Manager, testified that he did not see family status as an accommodation issue. His comprehension of what the Complainant was seeking, although he had never spoken to her, was an extension of the time she had to report in order to make childcare arrangements. He felt that CN had given her significant time to make the necessary arrangements.\n[129] For his part, Mr. Torchia testified that the request that came to me [he did not indicate from whom the request came] was that they [the Complainant, CW and CR] needed more time to sort out their affairs. It was child care issues and they needed more time. I granted the request. In my mind I was accommodating them by giving them more time. I didn't think that was unreasonable what I was doing. They had been off for a period of time, not like somebody who was set up, laid off, set up, laid off that would be expecting to go to work. They were off for a considerable period of time. So therefore they weren't probably expecting this at that point in time and giving them extra time to do that seemed reasonable in my mind. He added that he knew that there was parental obligations of some sort and he understood that the Complainant needed some time to make arrangements, but added that this did not raise in his mind any issue regarding the CHRA.\n[130] Both the testimony of the Complainant and of CN's witnesses establishes, without a doubt, that CN did not apply its accommodation policy in the Complainant's case. The evidence also demonstrates that other employees who needed accommodation for reasons that could also bring them under the purview of the CHRA and CN's accommodation policy and who did not report to Vancouver or did not report immediately, were not terminated by CN. For example, employees U and E, whose parents were ill, were both given leave of absence on compassionate ground and were not ordered to report to Vancouver. Also, other employees whose situations were not explained at the hearing were either given leave of absences or were set up by their supervisors and did not have to report to cover the shortage.\n[131] CN's justification for denying the Complainant's request for accommodation due to family status was essentially that the nature of its business required that all employees available report to Vancouver to help address the shortage in 2005. But, when asked by CN's counsel whether if, had the Complainant reported to Vancouver in 2005, that would have resolved the shortage, Ms. Storms answered without any hesitation, no, but immediately added that it would have meant that one less manager needed to fill in.\n[132] To evaluate whether there has been discrimination on a prohibited ground in an employment context, and whether an employer has accommodated an employee up to the point of undue hardship, the applicable test is the one set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Meiorin decision. In that decision, the Supreme Court of Canada standardized the test applicable to discrimination and rejected the old distinction between direct and indirect discrimination.\n[133] Once the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discriminatory, the onus shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the prima facie discriminatory standard or action is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In this regard, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated at paragraphs 54 and 55 of the Meiorin decision :\nAn employer may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\nthat the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\nThis approach is premised on the need to develop standards that accommodate the potential contributions of all employees in so far as this can be done without undue hardship to the employer. Standards may adversely affect members of a particular group, to be sure. But as Wilson J. noted in Central Alberta Dairy Pool, supra, at p. 518, [i]f a reasonable alternative exists to burdening members of a group with a given rule, that rule will not be [a BFOR]. It follows that a rule or standard must accommodate individual differences to the point of undue hardship if it is to be found reasonably necessary. Unless no further accommodation is possible without imposing undue hardship, the standard is not a BFOR in its existing form and the prima facie case of discrimination stands.\n[134] At the hearing, CN did not spend much time on the first two criteria in Meiorin, except to assert in its closing arguments that the evidence had clearly showed that the standard under review was enacted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of CN's business interest and that CN and the Union had enacted them in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the operation of CN's railway network. CN did not indicate on what evidence it was relying to make this affirmation and the reference to the Union is unsupported by the evidence, as nobody from the Union was called as a witness and I have no recollection of any evidence on this point by any other witnesses. Regardless, I will proceed to analyse the two first steps in assessing whether CN has successfully established a BFOR defence.\n[135] The first step is to identify the general purpose of the impugned standard and determine whether it is rationally connected to the performance of the job. The task is to determine what the impugned standard is generally designed to achieve. The focus at the first step is not on the validity of the particular standard that is at issue, but rather on the validity of its more general purpose. In this case, the particular standard at issue is the forcing of employees to cover a shortage. According to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement, employees hired subsequent to June 29th, 1990 can be forced to cover work at another terminal in the Western region and are obligated to report at that terminal within at most thirty (30) days unless they present a satisfactory reason justifying their failure to do so. These employees are commonly referred to as category D employees. They are also referred to as non-protected employees, insofar as they are obligated to respond to a recall outside of their terminal. If they do not respond to a recall their employment with CN can be terminated.\n[136] Other categories of employees include those who were hired prior to June 29, 1990. These are referred to as protected employees. In this group of protected employees we have those who were hired prior to 1982 and who are referred to as Category A and Category B employees, respectively. These employees cannot be assigned for work outside of their local terminals. Employees hired after 1982, but prior to June 29, 1990, are referred to as Category C employees and may only be assigned to protect work at adjacent terminals.\n[137] In this case, category D employees, which include the Complainant, were recalled from lay off and forced to cover the shortage in Vancouver. As we have seen due to its location, the Vancouver terminal is a very active one. It constitutes a focal point for CN's Canadian market. A shortage of running trades employees in Vancouver carries significant implications, as it can affect CN's ability to operate adequately throughout its network. Neither the Complainant nor the CHRC contested the fact that CN had a legitimate purpose in seeking to address the shortage of Conductors in Vancouver in 2005. Forcing employees to cover shortages can be considered as rationally connected to the performance of the job, certainly when the shortage can have an impact on the operation of the employer. The Tribunal therefore concludes that CN has met the first part of the Meiorin tripartite test.\n[138] Once the legitimacy of CN's more general purpose is established, it must take the second step of demonstrating that it adopted the particular standard with an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose, with no intention of discriminating against the claimant. If the imposition of the standard was not thought to be reasonably necessary or was motivated by a discriminatory intention, then it cannot be a BFOR. (See Meiorin, supra, at para. 60). There was no evidence submitted at the hearing to the effect that CN's standard of forcing employees to cover shortages, as it is expressed in article 148.11 of the Collective agreement, was adopted with the intention of discriminating against the claimant. It is true that counsel for the Complainant did raise in his closing arguments a point about article 148.11 being discriminatory. More specifically, he alluded to the differences in treatment between Conductors, who were hired prior to June 1990 and those hired afterwards. He noted that the Complainant had not commenced her employment with CN under this distinction. The evidence shows that the Complainant was hired in 1991, but that the distinction was introduced in February 1992 and applied to employees hired after June 1990. Counsel further argued that since the vast majority of women Conductors were hired after June 1990, this distinction constituted a discriminatory practice against women Conductors. Although interesting from an argumentative point of view, the Tribunal cannot find any convincing evidence to support this conclusions. The Tribunal concludes therefore that CN has met the second part of the Meiorin test.\n[139] CN's third and final hurdle is to demonstrate that the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose. At this stage, CN must establish that it cannot accommodate the Complainant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. In other words, since the Complainant was adversely affected on the ground of her family status by the standard of forcing employees to cover shortages could CN accommodate her without experiencing undue hardship? The answer to this question will be in the affirmative for the following reasons.\n[140] The use of the term undue infers that some hardship is acceptable. It is only undue hardship that satisfies this test. (See Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at page 984.) It may be ideal for an employer to adopt a practice or standard that is uncompromisingly stringent, but if it is to be justified it must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship. (Meiorin, supra, at para. 62.) Furthermore, when an employer is assessing whether it can accommodate an employee it must do an individualized assessment of the employee's situation. In this regard, in McGill University Health Centre (Montr\u00e9al General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital general de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 161, at para. 22, the Supreme Court of Canada stated: The importance of the individualized nature of the accommodation process cannot be minimized.\n[141] In Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489, at pages 520-21, Wilson J. addressed the factors that may be considered when assessing an employer's duty to accommodate an employee to the point of undue hardship. Amongst the relevant factors are the financial cost of the possible methods of accommodation, the relative interchangeability of the workforce and facilities and the prospect of substantial interference with the rights of other employees. It was also stated that a standard or practice that excludes members of a particular group on impressionistic assumptions is generally suspect. (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia Council of Human Rights, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer), at para. 31). Employers must also be innovative yet practical when considering accommodation options in particular circumstances.\n[142] In his closing arguments, CN's counsel suggested that the Supreme Court of Canada had restated the principles applying to the notion of undue hardship in its decision in Hydro Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), 2008 SCC. The Tribunal does not accept this interpretation of that decision. On the contrary, the Tribunal finds this decision to be consistent with the previous decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue of undue hardship. In Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, the Court stated that although the employer does not have a duty to change the working conditions in a fundamental way, it does have the duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee's workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work. (par. 16). The Court also stated that [b]ecause of the individualized nature of the duty to accommodate and the variety of circumstances that may arise, rigid rules must be avoided. If a business can, without, undue hardship, offer the employee a variable work schedule or lighten his or her duties - or even authorize staff transfers - to ensure that the employee can do his or her work, it must do so to accommodate the employee. (para. 17.) (See also Jonhstone v. Canada Border Services, supra, at para. 218.)\n[143] CN argues that if accommodation was required under the CHRA, reasonable accommodation was provided by it granting the Complainant more than four (4) months to report to Vancouver, rather than the minimum fifteen (15) days set out in the Collective Agreement. CN further states that granting the relief sought by the Complainant would constitute undue hardship because it would effectively grant all employees who are parents an equivalent to super seniority under the Collective Agreement solely on the basis of their status as parents.\n[144] I will address first the claim that reasonable accommodation was provided.\n[145] CN argues that providing extra time to the Complainant to report to Vancouver was all the accommodation that it was required to provide. However, the evidence clearly shows that such accommodation was not in any way a meaningful response to the Complainant's request and to the factual underpinnings of her situation which she had communicated to the employer through her correspondence.\n[146] The unchallenged evidence of the Complainant establishes that she wrote to Mr. Pizziol, the trainmaster in Jasper, and to other managers of CN on numerous occasions, explaining her family situation. She informed them that it would be difficult for her to take her children to Vancouver and that because of childcare responsibilities neither was it feasible to leave them with their father whose own work obligations would cause the same difficulties with childcare. She also requested that her situation be considered on a compassionate basis under the collective agreement and that she be allowed to wait out until Vancouver no longer required her services or until there was work available at the Jasper terminal or at the adjacent terminal in Edson.\n[147] Ms. Storms testified that she did not see these letters as indicating that the Complainant was seeking accommodation regarding her family status. She added that the manager of the division, in this case Mr. Pizziol, was the primary decision maker in terms of granting or not an employee's request to be relieved from reporting to a shortage. She added that to make that decision, he would have taken the person's situation into account and decided what to do with it. Mr. Pizziol had the power to either grant a leave of absence or an extension of the delay to report. Ms. Storms further added that in the case of a large shortage, like the one occurring in Vancouver in 2005, the manager would also discuss the situation with his general manager. In 2005, the general manager to whom Mr. Pizziol reported was Denis Broshko.\n[148] As it was the case for Mr. Pizziol, Mr. Broshko was not called as a witness and no explanation was given for his absence. There was also no evidence submitted by CN indicating that Mr. Pizziol had actually discussed the Complainant's situation with Mr. Broshko.\n[149] Mr. Torchia testified on cross-examination that he had had discussion with the General Chairperson of UTU regarding the possibility of extending the time the Complainant had to report to cover the shortage. He added that during these discussions the issue of accommodation for family status was never mentioned and that he had never seen the Complainant's correspondence on this matter.\n[150] The evidence clearly establishes that CN was not sensitive to the Complainant's situation. It did not answer her many requests for some form of accommodation and did not even meet or contact her to discuss her situation, even though its own accommodation policy directs that the employee be met as a first step in the process. It is also clear from there evidence, that neither Mr. Storms nor Mr. Torchia felt that they had any responsibility regarding any issue pertaining to the CHRA. They both testified that the supervisor of the employee and Human Resources were the ones with whom this issue should be raised. Unfortunately for CN, as indicated above, neither Mr. Pizziol, nor the person responsible for Human Resources in Edmonton, Ms. Mary-Jane Morrison, were called as witnesses.\n[151] It is clear that CN witnesses did not consider family status - at least, family status matters that involve parental obligations and responsibilities - as a ground of discrimination that necessitated any form of accommodation. In their conception of the various grounds of discrimination set out in the CHRA, they seem to have chosen some grounds as opening a right to accommodation and others that did not. For example, they testified that CN had not hesitated to accommodate some employees who were recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver because of a sick parent. They also acknowledge that CN had in the past accommodated employees for medical reason. But without inquiring into the nature of her request, they decided that the Complainant's situation did not qualify as one requiring accommodation under the CHRA.\n[152] Ms. Ziemer also testified that CN had accommodated an employee in order to allow him to be absent from the working board every second weekend because he only had visitation rights for 48 hours every two weeks. In another case an accommodation was granted to an employee who was involved in a lengthy custody battle in Court. This person was given additional time off for this reason.\n[153] Even if the Tribunal was to accept CN's argument that it had provided appropriate accommodation to the Complainant by granting her more time to report to Vancouver, CN's failure to meet the procedural obligations of the duty to accommodate would in itself still give rise to a violation of the Complainant's human rights. The Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged that both the decision-making process and the final decision have to be taken into consideration in analyzing a BFOR. In Meiorin, the Court stated at para. 66: It may often be useful as a practical matter to consider separately, first, the procedure, if any, which was adopted to assess the issue of accommodation and, second, the substantive content of either a more accommodating standard which was offered or alternatively the employer's reasons for not offering any such standard. (See also Oak Bay Marina Ltd.v. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal) (No. 2), 2004 BCHRT 225, at paras. 84-86).\n[154] In Lane v. ADGA Group Consultant Inc., 2007 HRTO 34, at para. 150, (decision upheld by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Divisional Court, at [2008] O.J. No. 3076, 91 O.R.(3d) 649) the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal held that:\n...[T]he failure to meet the procedural dimensions of the duty to accommodate is a form of discrimination. It denies the affected person the benefit of what the law requires: a recognition of the obligation not to discriminate and to act in such a way as to ensure that discrimination does not take place.\n[155] In Meiorin, the Supreme Court identified the following question as being relevant in analyzing the procedural part of the accommodation process followed by the employer:\nHas the employer investigated alternative approaches that do not have a discriminatory effect, such as individual testing against a more individually sensitive standard? If alternative standards were investigated and found to be capable of fulfilling the employer's purpose, why were they not implemented? Is it necessary to have all employees meet the single standard for the employer to accomplish its legitimate purpose or could standards reflective of group or individual differences and capabilities be established? Is there a way to do the job that is less discriminatory while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate purpose? Is the standard properly designed to ensure that the desired qualification is met without placing an undue burden on those to whom the standard applies? Have other parties who are obliged to assist in the search for possible accommodation fulfilled their roles?\n[156] To meet the procedural component of the duty to accommodate, CN had a duty to show that it had considered and reasonably rejected any accommodation that would have accommodated the needs of the Complainant.\n[157] The only evidence that this assessment of other form of accommodation might have occurred is that of Kerry Morris who testified that CN had had discussion, in the context of the grievance negotiation with UTU, about alternative means of accommodation so that the Complainant and the two other employees CR and KW could stay in Jasper. He suggested that UTU had proposed moving Conductors from an adjacent terminal to Vancouver, but according to Mr. Morris this was not feasible as all employees at the Kamloops terminal were working and moving them to Vancouver would only create a shortage in Kamloops. He explained that another alternative would have been to move three other employees from the Jasper terminal to Vancouver to cover the shortage instead of the Complainant and KW and CR, but, according to Mr. Morris, UTU felt that this solution was contrary to the seniority provision of the collective agreement and it was not ready to give its approval. Other than this, there was no evidence that CN considered or investigated alternative approaches to the Complainant's situation and even with these options, the evidence shows that they were only considered after the termination of the Complainant's employment. The Tribunal also notes that this evidence is not consistent with the evidence given on this matter in the Whyte and Richards cases.\n[158] The evidence also indicates that CN did not apply its own accommodations guidelines and policies. CN has a very comprehensive accommodation policy. This policy recognizes all the prohibited grounds enumerated in the CHRA, including family status, and the policy clearly indicates that, wherever possible, employment policies and practices are to be adjusted so that no individual is denied employment opportunities... It also specifies that accommodation means making every possible effort to meet the reasonable needs of employees.\n[159] CN Accommodation Guidelines explains that the objective of the Policy is to ensure that working conditions are not a barrier to employment. It also makes clear that CN has to show flexibility in eliminating any barriers and that it should make every effort to ensure that no one is put at a disadvantage because of a special need or requirement.\n[160] The policy also defines the process to be followed in case an accommodation for one of the enumerated grounds is raised and it provides a checklist to be followed by managers and supervisors in case of such a request. The policy explains:\nThe first thing to do when an employee reports a problem or special need is to meet with the individual. Allow the employee to present the problem or need, ask questions to fully understand the request, and together discuss possible solutions.\nIf no solutions can be identified in this manner, do not reject the request outright. Ask for advice, seek other solutions to the problem, and evaluate the impact of any potential accommodation with the appropriate functions, including the People department, among other. The employee has the responsibility to participate actively in the process, and to facilitate reasonable accommodation. Unions also have a recognized and important role and responsibility in the accommodation of the needs of employees.\nIt is extremely important to keep records of the meeting held, the various solutions proposed, and the arguments used to accept or reject each option. This information is indispensable in the event of a complaint.\nPromptly inform the person in question of the decision taken, explaining the reasons for the decision. In the event that a request for accommodation is denied, employees may have a right to grieve under the appropriate grievance procedure or make a complaint under the CHRA.\n[161] The person responsible for the accommodation policy at CN's Edmonton office is, as indicated earlier, Mary-Jane Morrison, a Human Resources Officer. It is with her that people who have question about the policy or its procedure consult. As noted earlier, Ms. Morrison was not a witness at the hearing. Instead, CN called as witness Stephanie Ziemer, the Human Resources Officer in Vancouver. Ms. Ziemer had no hands on implication or any personal knowledge of the Complainant's situation, but she did testify that she would have expected that the policy had been followed in this case and that at some point Human Resources would have been involved. No evidence of any involvement by Human Resources was presented at the hearing.\n[162] It is also clear from the evidence of CN other witnesses that they felt that the accommodation policy was not any of their concerns. Mr. Torchia, for example, testified in cross-examination that he knew that CN had an accommodation policy in 2005, although he added that he had never received any formal training on it. He was also unable to say if there had been any in house training or seminars on the application of the CHRA for managers and supervisors, although he added that he was sure there had been. He added that throughout his career he had dealt with issues of accommodation in various grievances and in his dealings with the Union.\n[163] Asked by CN counsel whether she was familiar with the duty to accommodate under the CHRA, Ms. Storms answered No, not specifically. I know that it's there and if I had to deal with it I would refer an employee to Human Resources. On cross-examination she added: I knew of it but I didn't know the specifics of it. From our end what we handle is the pay end of it and once the accommodation is made we'll be directed by Human Resources and the Division to adjust the pay, that's my area of responsibility. I would have simply left it in Pizziol's hands. I don't know what he would have done with it. He may have gone to his boss, he could have gone several ways and I have no idea, you would have to ask Mr. Pizziol. (The emphasis is mine.) Mr. Pizziol was not called as a witness.\n[164] Ron Morrese, the General Supervisor of Operation, a senior manager at CN, testified that he had probably seen the accommodation policy, although he did not remember the details. He added that he was always in operations and that Human Resources dealt with the policy. He explained that they had the authority to tell operations what to do in those cases.\n[165] According to the Complainant's evidence, CN's accommodation policy was not followed in her case. She added that she never met with her supervisor, the trainmaster in Jasper, nor did she get any response to the letters she had sent him or to other supervisors or managers of CN explaining her situation. There was also no evidence that she had met with anybody at Human Resources or that she had been referred to them. It is clear from the evidence that CN did not follow the procedure set out in its own policy and that it had decided that family status, at least in terms of parental obligations and responsibilities, was not a ground of discrimination for which accommodation was required. It is also clear that CN never did an individualized assessment of the Complainant's situation as it was required to do.\n[166] I will know deal briefly with CN's position to the effect that it would be undue hardship to grant the relief sought by the Complainant because she would then be granted super seniority based on the simple fact of her status as a parent.\n[167] According to Stephanie Ziemer, CN does not capture the information regarding how many of its employees are parents. She added that the only way to have this information would be to review each employee's file to see who they designate as dependants. Ms. Ziemer further added that from CN's employees group insurance benefit plan we can assume that approximately 68% of [CN's] workforce are parents. This very partial evidence falls well short of the evidence that CN would need to produce to justify discrimination on a balance of probabilities using the tripartite Meiorin BFOR test.\n[168] CN did not produce evidence to prove that accommodating the Complainant in this case would have constituted undue hardship for the company. On the contrary, CN's counsel during his examination of Ms. Storms asked her the following question: If Ms. Seeley had reported to Vancouver in 2005 would that have resolved the shortage? Her answer was: No, it wouldn't have resolved the shortage but everybody counts. We would have had one more person to man the operation and we would have used one less manager to fill in. (The emphasis is mine.)\n[169] Furthermore, if the Tribunal was to accept CN's argument that because a vast majority of its employees are parents, accommodating the Complainant would cause it undue hardship, that would mean that any workplace with a large number of persons falling into a group with one or the other of the personal characteristics set forth in section 3 of the CHRA would automatically be precluded from the application of the law. For example, it would mean that women working in a workplace where the vast majority of employees are women would be precluded from making a complaint of discrimination based on gender. Accepting CN's argument would have the effect of making it impossible for an individual to make a complaint on the ground of family status - at least, family status matters that involve parental obligations and responsibilities - because most of the employees in the workforce are parents and could also potentially follow the same route.\n[170] CN did not produce any evidence that it was overwhelmed with requests for accommodation from people in the Complainant's situation. Only two other complaints, those of CR and KW, were produced. In Grismer, supra, at para. 41, the Supreme Court of Canada stated quite clearly that in the context of accommodation impressionistic evidence of increased expense will not generally suffice. In Lane, supra, at paragraph 117, the Ontario Divisional Court added:\nUndue hardship cannot be established by relying on impressionistic or anecdotal evidence, or after-the-fact justifications. Anticipated hardships caused by proposed accommodations should not be sustained if based only on speculative or unsubstantiated concern that certain adverse consequences might or could result if the claimant is accommodated.\n[171] Regardless of the particular basis for CN's claim that it will suffer undue hardship, it is well established that the undue hardship analysis must be applied in the context of the individual accommodation being requested. As the Supreme Court stated in Grismer, supra, at paragraph 19, accommodation must be incorporated into the standard itself to ensure that each person is assessed according to her or his own personal abilities, instead of being judged against presumed group characteristics which are frequently based on bias and historical prejudice. Accordingly, an employee's individual assessment is an essential step in the accommodation process unless it is in itself an undue hardship for the respondent (See Grismer, at paragraphs 22, 30, 32 and 38; Meiorin, at paragraph 65; Audet v. National Railway, 2006 CHRT 25, at paragraph 61 and Knight v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de l'Outaouais, 2007 CHRT 15, at paragraph 72). Again, this individual assessment was not done in the case of the Complainant.\n[172] Arguments that the acceptance of the need to accommodate in one instance will open the floodgates to claims by other employees are, in my view, unacceptable. As the Human Rights and Citizenship Commission of Alberta noted in Rawleigh v. Canada Safeway Ltd, unreported decision, September 29th, 2009, at para. 242 every case must be weighed on its own merits and unique circumstances. To support the belief that the floodgates may be opened to opportunistic individuals is very dangerous and possibly discriminatory.\n[173] In the instant case, CN failed to provide evidence that accommodating the Complainant would cause undue hardship in terms of costs. The only evidence regarding cost was with respect to the training of Conductors and there was no attempt to relate that evidence to the situation in the present case. We must remember that in order to be found to be undue, the cost of accommodation must be substantial. In Quesnel v. London Educational Health Centre (1995), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/474 (Ont. Bs. Inq.), the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal stated, at paragraph 59: cost would amount to undue hardship only if it would alter the essential nature or substantially affect the viability of the enterprise responsible for the accommodation. This is recognized in CN's own Accommodation policy which states: The costs incurred must be extremely high before the refusal to accommodate can be justified. The burden of justifying the refusal rests with the employer. The cost incurred must be quantifiable and related to the accommodation. Renovations or special equipment can be expensive but financial aid may sometimes be obtained from various organizations.\ne) Conclusion [174] For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence has established that CN has breached sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA. CN's practice of requiring the Complainant to protect the shortage in Vancouver has had an adverse effect on her because of her family status. The evidence demonstrates that CN acted contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA by pursuing a policy and practice that deprived the Complainant of employment opportunities based upon her family status.\nD. REMEDIES [175] The remedies sought by the Complainant are compensation for lost wages and benefits, compensation for pain and suffering, special compensation, legal cost and interest and an order that she be reinstated in her employment with CN with full seniority, benefits and all other opportunities or privileges that were denied to her. The CHRC also seeks an order ensuring that CN cease all discriminatory practices and behaviour and that it review its accommodation policy.\n(i) An Order that CN Review its Accommodation Policy [176] The CHRC requests an order, pursuant to section 53(2)a) of the CHRA, that CN take measures, in consultation with the CHRC, to redress its failure to properly accommodate its employees on the basis of family status, including issues of parental obligations and responsibilities. It further requests an order that appropriate human rights training for CN's managerial, human resources and crew management personal be put in place and that regular information sessions on accommodation policies in an effort to eliminate discriminatory attitudes and assumptions related to family status as a ground of discrimination be held.\n[177] Although the Tribunal acknowledges that CN has a good policy on accommodation, it is clear that it has not been applied or implemented properly in the case of family status as a ground of discrimination. CN's managers and supervisors have failed to follow this policy in the Complainant's case. Having reviewed the evidence, I conclude that CHRC's request is justified.\n[178] I therefore order CN to work with the Commission to ensure that the discriminatory practice and behaviour does not continue and to make sure:\nthat the appropriate policies, practices and procedures are in place, and that CN, in consultation with the CHRC, retains appropriate persons to conduct workplace training for managers, human resource and crew management staff on issues of discrimination and human rights and particularly on accommodation on the ground of family status,\n(ii) Reinstatement [179] The Complainant seeks an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, directing CN to return her to her employment as a Conductor with CN. Section 53(2)(b) of the CHRA states that where the Tribunal finds the complaint is substantiated, it may order a respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied the victim as a result of the practice.\n[180] In order to provide this remedy in the present case, the Complainant must therefore be returned to her job without loss of seniority. The Tribunal orders CN to set up the Complainant to her position as Conductor at the Jasper terminal, after she has, if necessary, updated her rules and medical certificates. On the unchallenged facts put forward by the Complainant, there are three possible starting dates that the Tribunal could reasonably fix for the Complainant reinstatement. The first date suggested is July 1st, 2005, which could be seen as the effective date for implementation of the Complainant's request to be accommodated by being set up in a full time position in Jasper. The Tribunal does not accept this as an appropriate date as there was no evidence that the Complainant could have been set up in a full time position in Jasper at that time or if this would have been the appropriate accommodation. There was also no evidence of any employees being set up in Jasper at that time.\n[181] The second date is March 1st, 2006. According to the evidence, this is the date that another laid off employee from Jasper, who had been recalled and had reported to Vancouver, was set up in Jasper. Since only four employees from Jasper, the Complainant, CR, KW and this employee, had been recalled and told to report to Vancouver it might be reasonable to expect that the Complainant, CR and KW would also have been set up in Jasper around March 2006. Again, there was no evidence produced showing that more than one employee had been set up in Jasper at that time and it is difficult for me to retain that date as the appropriate one.\n[182] Finally, evidence was produced that in March 2007, CN hired thirty-nine (39) new Conductors were in Jasper and that many of these new Conductors have since been set up. It is reasonable to conclude therefore that the Complainant had, at that time, seniority over these new Conductors and that she would have been set up in Jasper ahead of them. Therefore, I conclude that from the evidence, the Complainant would have been set up in March 2007 and this date is therefore the one retained for her reinstatement. In regards to her seniority, since seniority continues to accumulate even when an employee is on lay off, it will in this case continue to accumulate as if there had never been a breach in her relationship with CN in July, 2005.\n(iii) Compensation for lost earnings [183] The complainant seeks compensation for all wages and benefits lost pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Considering my conclusion as to the date of reinstatement, I order that the Complainant be compensated for all lost of wages and benefits from March 1st, 2007 to today. The parties are ordered to calculate the amount of wages owing using the formula provided for in the Collective Agreement. In regards to extra payments that a road Conductor could receive, since it would be difficult for the Tribunal to set an amount, it is ordered that the parties establish this amount by looking at the extras that were paid for the period to a Conductor with similar seniority working in the terminal, assuming that that Conductor had no unusual absences. The parties could, for example, take into consideration the extra payments that were paid to the employee who was set up in Jasper in March 2006.\n[184] In regards to the issue of mitigation of damages, there is no question that the Complainant had a duty to mitigate. According to the Complainant's evidence, after the termination of her employment with CN in 2005, she worked at odd jobs, for example, as a waitress in a restaurant or for an outfitter, but she could not give a precise list of all her employment. Surprisingly, she could not provide a figure for her income during those years. She said that she basically worked for tips and had no salary or was paid cash. She also added that because of the young age of her children she had not looked for other work during this period. The Complainant's evidence in regards to her efforts to mitigate her damages was not very convincing and at best demonstrated that during this period she did not make great effort to find alternative revenues.\n[185] Taking this into consideration, I conclude that it would be reasonable to reduce the amount awarded for lost of wages by thirty percent (30%).\n(iv) Pain and suffering [186] Section 53(2) of the CHRA provides for compensation for pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice, up to a maximum of $20,000.\n[187] The Complainant testified that the whole situation was deeply disturbing and that it had upset her very much. She further added I lost my career. I was discarded because I had kids. She said that following the July 2005 letter of termination she was depressed: I was shocked and deeply affected. My family noticed the changes. I was irritable. I felt violated and that I had been treated with no regards.\n[188] Her husband also testified that after she was fired, the Complainant was hurt, upset and irritable.\n[189] No medical evidence was produced to substantiate these claims. Nevertheless, I agree that CN's conduct and nonchalant attitude towards her situations was disturbing for the Complainant and that it must have upset her. Taking, this into consideration, I order CN to pay to the complainant $ 15,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering.\n(v) Wilful or Reckless Conduct [190] Section 53(3) of the CHRA provides for additional compensation where the Respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly up to a maximum of $20,000.\n[191] I agree that CN's conduct in this case was reckless. CN had adopted an accommodation policy, in the form of the Accommodation Guidelines, which set out the procedures to be followed with respect to any employees who required accommodation. This policy clearly identified family status as one of the ground for discrimination. Yet, CN and the senior managers involved in this case decided that they did not need to be concerned with family status and ignored their responsibilities under the policy. They didn't make any efforts to try to understand the Complainant's situations, ignored her letters, decided to treat her case as just a child care issue and to cherry-pick which ground of discrimination should give way to accommodation and which should not. This course of action was, in my view, reckless.\n[192] The Tribunal orders CN to pay to the Complainant the sum of $20,000, in additional compensation under section 53(3) of the Act.\n(vi) Costs and Interest. [193] In his closing arguments, counsel for the Complainant sought an award for legal cost. Since the close of this case, the Federal Court of Appeal has rendered a decision in Canada (Attorney General) v. Mowat, 2009 FCA 309, in which the questions were whether the Tribunal had the authority to award costs and whether the authority could be found in paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act which authorizes the Tribunal to compensate a complainant for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice.\n[194] After an analysis of Human Rights Codes in various provinces that allowed an award for cost and after analysing the purported intent of Parliament, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded at paragraph 95:\nThe quest is to determine whether Parliament intended to endow the Tribunal with the authority to award costs to a successful complainant. For the reasons given, I conclude that Parliament did not intend to grant, and did not grant, to the Tribunal the power to award costs. To conclude that the Tribunal may award legal costs under the guise of expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice would be to introduce indirectly into the Act a power which Parliament did not intend it to have\n[195] Taking into consideration the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, the Tribunal cannot accede to the Complainant's request that CN be ordered to pay her legal cost.\n[196] In regards to interest, interest is payable in respect of all the awards in this decision (s. 53(4) of the CHRA). The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53 (2)(e) of the CHRA) and the special compensation (s. 53(3)), the interest shall run from the date of the complaint.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario September 29, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1355\/8508\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nDenise Seeley v.

Introduction [1] This is an employment discrimination case on the basis of sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA). Cindy Richards (the Complainant) filed a complaint alleging that the Respondent, the Canadian National Railway (CN) has discriminated against her on the basis of her family status by failing to accommodate her and by terminating her employment.\n[2] CN denies the complainant's allegations.\n[3] All the parties, including the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC), were present at the hearing and were represented by counsel.\n[4] There are two other similar complaints filed against CN. By agreement of the parties, the matter in Denise Seeley v. CN was treated in a different hearing which was heard prior to this one. Although heard together, it was agreed during a case management conference that the complaints of Cindy Richards and Kasha A. Whyte would be rendered in two different decisions.\n[5] Although the facts in the Seeley case and in the Richards and Whyte cases are very similar and that the witnesses for CN were the same, except for Cathy Smolynek who only testified in the two latter cases, the evidence submitted in the Seeley case and in the Richards and Whyte cases is, in many regards, different. The witnesses of CN, who had testified previously in the Seeley matter, did not, without necessarily contradicting themselves, repeat exactly the same evidence in the Richards and Whyte cases. Also, documents which had not been presented at the Seeley hearing were filed as evidence in the Richards and Whyte cases. These differences will explain any discrepancies that may exist in the facts of the Richards and Whyte matter when they are compared to the Seeley decision.\nA. The Facts (i) The Canadian National Railway a) General information [6] CN is a federally regulated corporation which derives its revenues from the transportation of goods by train. It is a transcontinental railway company which operates in Canada and in the United States. Its freight trains transport goods 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.\n[7] CN has more than 15,000 employees in Canada. These employees are organised in two distinct groups described as operating and non-operating. The non-operating group is comprised of employees working in clerical, mechanical and engineering positions. The operating group employees, also known as running trades employees, consist of Conductors and locomotive engineers.\n[8] CN has over 4,000 running trades employees throughout Canada of which 2,400 are Conductors. According to Ms. Stephanie Ziemer, a Human Resources Officer for CN in Vancouver, the figure for Conductors in 2005 would have been slightly higher at 2,500.\n[9] In answer to a question from CN's counsel, Ms. Ziemer indicated that CN does not track the number of its employees who are parents. She added that this information is only solicited when the employees enroll for CN's group insurance benefits. She further added that based on that information roughly 69 percent of our employees are parents. According to her evidence this information would be up to date to May 2009. She added that she would estimate [the number] as being higher because, not everybody participates in our group insurance benefits, particularly if they have a spouse that has coverage outside of CN in terms of their employment.\n[10] Challenged by Counsel for the Complainant about the accuracy of those numbers, Ms. Ziemer explained that they had been gathered by CN's manager of benefits administration in Montreal. CN's counsel then showed counsels for the Complainant and the CHRC what was described by the Complainant's counsel as a thick bundle of names listed by what appears to be personnel number order. Although this list did identify Conductors and their dependants, counsel for the Complainant added that there was nothing about the 69 percent figure. She therefore concluded that someone must have then taken that document and done some calculations. She then asked that the documents where these calculations were done be produced.\n[11] Mr. Paquette, counsel for CN, explained that the calculation had been done by someone at CN's legal department. He then added that he had very likely communicated these numbers to the witness. Asked by the Chair if, when Ms. Ziemer had indicated that the numbers had been communicated to her by someone in Montreal, she meant the legal department, counsel answered very likely, but he added that the information itself comes from CN's human resources department. He added that it was simply a question of sitting down and doing the adding one by one.\n[12] On cross-examination, Ms. Ziemer indicated that she had not done the calculation herself. She added that the figure of 69% for both group was given to her during a conference call, but she could not remember who the person who gave her the information was. Regarding the thick bundle of names, Ms. Ziemer indicated that she was seeing this document for the first time at the hearing. Considering the evidence of Ms. Ziemer, the Tribunal will not give much weight to this part of her testimony.\n[13] For operation purposes, CN is divided in two main regions, the Eastern region and the Western region. The Western Region includes all of CN's rail terminals from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Thunder Bay, Ontario.\n[14] The Crew Management Centre (CMC) in Edmonton is a very important part of CN operations. It is responsible for all crew callings and deployment for the Western region. It manages the workforce deployment for running trade employees and a payroll of 204 million dollars. The CMC has fifty-four (54) employees who report to Elaine Storms, the Director of CMC. Ms. Storms occupied that position in 2005 and she was a key witness for CN at the hearing.\n[15] CN also has a Peoples Department which includes Human Resources and Labour Relations. Although both fall under the same department, they have very distinct functions. Human Resources deals, amongst other, with human rights complaints, while labour relation will deal with matters arising out of the collective agreement. In 2005, Mary-Jane Morrison was the Human Resources person in charge of the portfolio for running trades employees in Jasper.\nb) Running trades employees [16] As stated earlier, locomotive engineers and Conductors form part of what is identified as the running trades employees. Locomotive engineers operate the engine and Conductors are basically in charge of all the other aspects pertaining to the movement of a train.\n[17] Running trades employees either work road or yard. Road work consists of employees who will get on a train at a particular terminal and take the train to another terminal. A yard employee would typically work in the yard, switching box cars and making up trains. The yard employee does not leave the terminal.\n[18] In terms of hiring, CN tends to hire its running trades employees in large group. According to Ms. Ziemer, CN did a lot of hiring in the seventies and a little bit of hiring in the 80s and in the early 90s. She further added that CN has done significant hiring from 2005 straight through to the end of 2009.\n[19] In 1996 the percentage of women in the running trades was about 3 %. This figure was 3.7% in 2006 and is now around 3.1%.\n[20] The cost of training a Conductor is around 50,000 to 80,000 dollars. This amount includes the wages of the employee and of the instructor and also, if necessary, their accommodation. The training takes from four (4) to six (6) months. The cost of training a locomotive engineer is between 28,000$ to 30,000$, in addition to what it cost to train him or her as a Conductor.\n[21] In order to be qualified to work as a Conductor, an employee must have his rules and medical cards up to date. These cards have to be renewed every three years. If the employee is on the working board, he or she will generally get a notice telling him or her that his or her cards are about to expire and then he or she just needs to make the proper arrangements to bring them up to date. If the employee is on lay off, he will need to take care of this on his own, although for the rules card, he or she will need the approval of his supervisor.\n[22] When an employee is working or available to work, he is said to be on the working board. The working board includes all employees who are not on lay off. Employees on the working board are either on assignments or in a pool.\n[23] An employee can also be set up, meaning that he will be on the working board at his terminal. The decision to set up an employee is made by the manager of the terminal. The decision is based on the number of employees needed at the terminal to perform the work that is expected.\n[24] There is also another board, which forms part of the working board and which is designated as the spare board or emergency board. Employees on this board are only called to work to fill in when other employees are either on vacation or unavailable to work for any other reasons.\n[25] Due to the nature of CN's operations, running trades employees must be able to work where and when required, subject to restrictions imposed by law and by the collective agreement. In light of these considerations, CN feels that mobility and flexibility constitutes basic job requirements for these employees. It considers these requirements as necessary because of the volume of goods CN transports and because of the fluctuation in traffic which can occur over a short period of time due, for example, to changes in the economy or to seasonal factors such as the grain harvesting season.\n[26] The work schedule of a Conductor is very unpredictable. Depending on which board the Conductor is set on, he or she may know more or less about the kind of work he or she may be called upon to execute. Therefore, all working assignments on road service have totally unpredictable schedules. A Conductor is expected to be available to report to work within two hours of receiving a call from CMC. Once a Conductor reports for duty, he or she will have no idea of when exactly they will return home. They may be gone for a few hours up to almost two days.\n[27] Running trades employees work on a mileage basis. The working board is adjusted on a weekly basis so that each employee can do approximately 4,300 miles a month. When doing the adjustment of the working board, CN will look at the previous week to see how many miles were made by the employees. They will divide this number by 4,300 and the result will indicate the number of employees that would potentially be needed at a certain terminal for the following week.\n[28] At all relevant times to this matter, Conductors in the Western Region of Canada were represented by the United Transportation Union (Union). The applicable collective agreement for Conductors in the Western Region is Agreement 4.3 (the Collective Agreement).\nc) The changes made in 1992 and the creation of the furlough boards [29] In 1992, technological changes allowed CN to do away with the car at the tail end of the train, which is commonly known as the caboose. This decision prompted the elimination of the position of brakeman. After this decision, Conductors, who used to work in the caboose, were moved up to the front of the train with the locomotive engineer. Eliminating the position of brakeman meant that CN needed less running trades' employees to run its trains. The reduction in the number of employees was done through the negotiation process with the Union. The negotiation resulted in the creation of the furlough boards.\n[30] A furlough board comes into existence when there is a surplus of employees at a terminal, but not enough work for everyone. The employee on the furlough board has to remain available for work, but if he or she isn't called to go to work, he or she still gets paid his or her salary. Only a certain category of employees are allowed to bid on the furlough boards. These are called protected employees, while the non-protected employees are not entitled to the furlough board.\n[31] The changes made to the working conditions in 1992, also created the notion of forcing, which produces different results for different categories of employees in the running trades. According to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement, employees hired subsequent to June 29th, 1990, can be forced to cover work at another terminal in the Western region and are obligated to report at that terminal within at most thirty (30) days, unless they present a satisfactory reason justifying their failure to do so. These employees are commonly referred to as category D employees. They are also referred to as non-protected employees, insofar as they are obligated to respond to a recall outside of their terminal.\n[32] Other categories of employees include those who were hired prior to June 29th, 1990. These are referred to as protected employees. In this group of protected employees, we have those who were hired prior to 1982 and who are referred to as Category A and Category B employees, respectively. These employees cannot be assigned for work outside of their local terminals. Employees hired after 1982, but prior to June 29th, 1990, are referred to as Category C employees and may only be assigned to protect work at adjacent terminals. For example, Category C employees at the Jasper terminal could only be assigned to the adjacent terminals of Edson and Kamloops.\n[33] The status of protected employees represents an exception to the general rule. The number of these employees will diminish over time through simple attrition and the status will eventually disappear altogether.\n[34] With the creation of the furlough boards, which in essence allowed some employees to be protected at their home terminal, CN needed to find a way to fill positions in cases of shortages at other locations. This is where section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement came into being. It is this provision that allows CN to force unprotected employees to other terminals in the Western region to cover shortages.\n[35] Prior to the enactment of section 148.11, CN would get employees to cover shortages by issuing what is referred to as a shortage bulletins and allowing employees to bid on these shortages, if they so desired. These bulletins were put out at each change of card which would happen about four times a year. Since it is difficult for CN to predict where a shortage will occur, these bulletins would cover various locations, whether or not there was actually a shortage there. Employees who wished to work at a shortage at a certain location would post a bid for that location and if that location ever became short, the employee who had posted a bid could be called to cover the work there.\n[36] CN still puts out shortage bulletins and employees are still allowed to bid on these, but given that protected employees can now stay at their home terminal on the furlough board and still be paid, there is little incentive for them to bid on these potential shortages.\n[37] CN also uses a system which is referred to as whitemanning which allows it to send a surplus of employees at one terminal to an adjacent terminal. For example, in such a scenario employees in Kamloops, B.C., would be running trains that the Vancouver crews would normally take to Kamloops. According to Ms. Storms, whitemanning is the first thing CN turns to in case of a shortage, because it is a lot cheaper financially than forcing employees to cover a shortage.\n[38] It is also possible that managers will be called upon during a shortage situation. Almost all of the transportation managers are qualified to operate trains. As a general rule, CN will call upon its managers as a last resort after it has exhausted its supply of running trades employees, including laid off employees.\n[39] Employees who are assigned to another terminal pursuant to section 148.11 of the Collective Agreement are afforded with certain amenities at their assigned terminal. These include, when available, rooms equipped with kitchenettes and also the possibility of travelling back to their home residence at regular intervals or, alternatively, having CN cover the cost associated with bringing a family member to the shortage location.\n[40] According to subsection 148.11(f) of the Collective Agreement, the first employee called upon to protect work will be the junior qualified employee on lay off in the seniority territory with a seniority date subsequent to June 29, 1990. The collective agreement does not provide for a maximum duration for covering work. If the shortage turns out to be permanent, then CN will proceed to hire people for that location.\n[41] Section 115 of the Collective Agreement provides that an employee who is laid off will be given preference for re-employment when staff is increased in his seniority district and will be returned to service in order of seniority. The provision also provides that if the employee is employed elsewhere at the time of recall, he may be allowed thirty (30) days to report. If he or she fails to report for duty or fails to give satisfactory reason for not doing so, he or she will forfeit all his or her seniority rights.\n[42] An employee, who would wish to raise a satisfactory reason to justify his or her failure to report for work would first have to make a request to Crew Management Centre (CMC). He or she would then be instructed to write a letter to his or her immediate supervisor at his home terminal. If the reason raised could have an impact on the Collective Agreement some discussions with the union might be necessary.\n(ii) The Complainant [43] The Complainant lives in Jasper, Alberta with her two children. She was originally hired by CN in the province of Quebec, in 1989. In 1992, she was called to fill a shortage in Vancouver and while there was told by somebody at CN that her work opportunities would be better in the Western Region. Therefore, on April 9th, 1992, she applied for a transfer to Vancouver. By doing so, she crossed the seniority district between the Eastern and Western regions and lost the seniority she had accumulated in the Eastern region since 1989. Her new date of seniority was now 1992.\n[44] Because she was hired after 1982, but prior to June 29th, 1990, the Complainant, if she had stayed in the Eastern Region, would have been a Category C employee which would have meant that she could only be assigned to protect work at an adjacent terminal. The Complainant testified that she did not know this when she decided to transfer to the Western Region. According to her evidence, at that time CN and the Union were in the negotiation process and no classes of employees had yet been created.\n[45] Just after she moved to Vancouver, the Complainant was laid off and forced to protect work in McClennan, Alberta. In the spring of 1993, when she was five (5) months pregnant, she was forced to protect work in Edmonton. Her first child was born on September 8th, 1993 and her second on November 30th, 1994.\n[46] In 1995, the Complainant and her husband, a locomotive engineer with CN, desiring more stability for their young family, elected to transfer to Jasper, as this terminal had a shortage of employees at that time.\n[47] In 1997, the Complainant and her husband separated. Their divorce was finalized in 2001. According to the divorce order, they share custody of their two children. The children's primary residence is with the Complainant.\n[48] In September 1998, the Complainant was laid off from her position as Conductor with CN. At that time, the local Union representatives in Jasper had a local agreement with CN. That agreement allowed for laid off Conductors who booked on the emergency board to be called to work ahead of those employees on the active furlough board. From that time until 2001, the Complainant worked on the Jasper emergency board, responding to calls when needed. The local agreement was changed in 2001, when CN decided that it wanted to be able to call the active furlough board employees before any laid off employees. CN felt that since it was paying a guarantee to the furlough board employees, but not to the laid off employees, it was financially advantageous for the company to use the furlough board employees first before it had to call the laid off employees to perform emergency work. After this change, given the number of employees on the furlough board in Jasper, there was no opportunity for a laid off employee who booked OK on the emergency board being called.\n[49] The Complainant's rules and medical cards expired around 2003. She testified that she had asked to have her rules recertified, but that her request had been denied by the supervisor in Jasper.\n[50] In 2004, the Complainant obtained a new rules card and pre-employment medical clearance. Commencing in June 2005, she again worked the Jasper emergency board. In fact, prior to her termination in July, 2005, she had worked 9 tours of duty.\n[51] At the beginning of 2005, the Complainant's eldest child was 11 years old and in grade 6. Her younger child was 10 years old and in grade 5. They were both attending school in Jasper.\n(iii) The Vancouver shortage [52] In February 2005, CN was experiencing a severe shortage of running trades employees in its Vancouver terminal. This situation was mainly due to a growing economy and an increase in CN's business volume which had outpaced its capacity to provide enough running trade employees locally to cover the work it had. According to Ms. Storms, seventy-two (72) Conductors were needed in Vancouver to cover the shortage and Vancouver had only fifty-three (53) Conductors working, so they were nineteen (19) short. She added that it was definitively one of the most serious shortages that I had seen in my career.\n[53] To accentuate the seriousness of this shortage, Ms. Storms testified that for the period between February 4th, 2005, to January 15th, 2006, the Vancouver yard had 726 overtime shifts for a total amount of $229,350.30. On cross-examination, she added that these numbers included the overtime done not only by Conductors, but also by locomotive engineers and, she added, possibly by yardmasters.\n[54] Ms. Storms also testified that at about the same period the Jasper terminal was in a surplus situation. She explained that when, as it was the case in Jasper, a terminal has a furlough board, is supporting other terminals with whitemen and has employees on lay off, it is considered to be in a surplus situation. But she did acknowledge that in 2005, managers were used in Jasper because of train delays. She also added that for part of 2005 it became busier in Jasper and that after August 6th, 2005, there was no longer any employees on the furlough board there.\n[55] Due to its location, the Vancouver terminal is a very active one. It includes extensive yard and intermodal operations where goods are transferred from and onto ships. The Vancouver terminal therefore constitutes a focal point for CN's Canadian market as vast amounts of materials and consumer goods shipped to and from Asia and North America transits through it and are afterwards transported throughout Canada on CN's rail network.\n[56] A shortage of running trades employees in Vancouver carries significant implications, as it can affect CN's ability to operate adequately throughout its network.\n[57] In order to maintain its level of operation, CN decided in February 2005 to recall laid off Conductors from the Western region to protect the shortage affecting the Vancouver terminal. These employees were non-protected employees with a seniority date subsequent to June 29th, 1990. As such, they were subject to Article 148.11(c) of the Collective Agreement.\n[58] According to Ms. Storms' evidence, shortages are managed by the Board Adjustment Group at CMC. This Group was at that time under the direction of Joe Lyon who reported directly to Ms. Storms. The Board Adjustment Group dealt with the Vancouver shortage of 2005, but because it was short on staff, crew dispatchers were also involved in contacting the employees who were recalled to cover the shortage.\n[59] Ms. Storms testified that during that period she went to Vancouver to help with the deployment of officers. She added that officers had been called in from all over Canada to help with the shortage. She also testified that 2,144 tours had been handled by officers during the Vancouver shortage. She further added that this would be the most usage of officers that I've seen in the west in my career.\n[60] In terms of how long this shortage might last, Ms. Storms testified that if the Complainant had reported to Vancouver, she would have probably stayed there for approximately a year, since the shortage situation in Vancouver was not resolved before 2006.\n[61] According to the evidence of Ms. Ziemer the shortage was eventually resolved over a period of a couple of years by CN hiring the right amount of employees in order to keep ahead of the amount of attrition and the significant growth in the business. She further explained that Vancouver is a very competitive job market: Unfortunately the construction industry was booming. We also lost a lot of potential candidates to the boom in the oil and gas industry in Northern Alberta. [...], it was very difficult for us to recruit over those two years [2005 and 2006], and it became cyclical. We didn't have enough successful employees through the recruitment selection process, so we had to readvertise, hold numerous career fairs. We had to advertise over and over again until we had the right amount of employees. And this was cyclical from 2005 through to probably mid-2007.\n[62] Employees reporting to cover the shortage at the Vancouver terminal, would be asked to show up at the Thornton Yard, in Surrey, and from there, since Vancouver has a number of yards, they would be taxied to wherever they were needed. Employees would only be informed when they got to Vancouver where they were going to work and what shift they would be working on.\n[63] Ms. Ziemer also testified as to the housing arrangements for employees reporting to the Vancouver shortage. She explained that there were two hotels available in Surrey, B.C. One of these hotels was situated several blocks from CN's yards. This hotel, according to Ms. Ziemer's recollection, had large suites with fridges inside and then there was a communal kitchen set up for CN employees. The other hotel was closer to the yard and had suites. Ms. Ziemer added My understanding is that they had kitchen facilities in the suites as well.\n[64] She also testified that CN could approve the rental of a house, an apartment or a condo. She referred to a situation which occurred in Vancouver - although she did not say when - where CN had approved the rental of a property because the price of the rental made more sense economically than paying $90 a night or $100 a night or a hotel for the 20 or 30 days that an employee would be required to be at the location to protect work\n(iv) The Conductors recalled to cover the Vancouver shortage [65] Forty-seven (47) laid off Conductors in the Western region were recalled to cover the Vancouver shortage in February 2005. Ms. Storms explained that employees are recalled on a seniority basis, starting with the senior person in the district. She added that CN would not allow a senior employee to bypass an opportunity to work, because that would mean that they were not protecting their seniority according to the Collective Agreement. At the time of the recall, the Complainant was first on the seniority list of laid off employees at the Jasper terminal.\n[66] Of the forty-seven (47) laid-off employees recalled, ten (10) reported to Vancouver and thirty (30) did not report and either resigned or were dismissed. The remaining seven (7) were either excused from reporting or were required at their home terminal.\n[67] The forty-seven (47) employees were initially contacted by phone. According to Ms. Storms, when these employees were called they were told that they had fifteen (15) days to report to cover the shortage. She further added that she had instructed her group not to venture any information about the possible duration of the shortage since they did not have that information.\n[68] At the hearing, CN produced Excel Spreadsheets containing information relevant to five employees who, according to its Amended Statement of Particulars, had reported to Vancouver. Counsel for the CHRC requested that CN produce the same information it had provided for these five employees for all of the other forty two employees recalled to Vancouver. These documents were disclosed in the form of Excel spreadsheets and contained numerous pages of information concerning their status during the particular period relevant to these proceedings.\n[69] According to the Respondent List of Exhibits in this hearing, CN put into evidence the CATS records for five employees. (See Exhibit R-1, Tab 27 through Tab 31 inclusively.) It also put into evidence two other CATS records (See Exhibits R-10 and R-11). Ms. Storms was questioned and cross-examined thoroughly on them by counsels. For its part the Commission put into evidence the CATS records for fifteen other employees. (See Exhibits HR-1, Tab 5 through and including Tab 10 and HR-2, Tab 23 through and including Tab 30).\n[70] The remainders of the CATS records disclosed by CN were put into evidence by the complainants' counsel (See Exhibit C-33). These documents were not put into evidence in the format provided by CN. The complainant's counsel, during her cross-examination of Ms. Storms, explained that she had created what she described as a document in a new format by re-sorting the information contained in the original Excel spreadsheet provided by CN. This new document was re-sorted in such way that it showed which employees recalled to Vancouver were available on any given date in the year 2005.\n[71] On the last day of the hearing, CN's counsel raised an issue concerning the accuracy of some of the information on the spreadsheets. On January 18th, 2010, more than two months after the hearing, CN filed a motion asking permission to reopen its case to file further new evidence. This motion was dealt with in a ruling which can be found at 2010 CHRT 6.\n[72] CN produced the documents and, as noted earlier, decided to put it in through the evidence of Ms. Storms. We can infer from this that CN felt that she had sufficient knowledge of the information contained on these documents to be able to testify to them. We will go over some of the information contained in these documents in some detail, as it was apparent that they were important for all the parties. In order to protect the privacy of the employees concerned, they will be identified by letters which do not correspond to their actual names.\n[73] The documents indicate that employee AB, although recalled did not report to the Vancouver shortage. On March 22th, 2005, he was set up at the Sioux Lookout terminal. He continued to work there to the end of the year. Having been set up at his home terminal, he did not have to cover the shortage in Vancouver. Although this employee was set up on March 22nd, the documents indicate that he only worked on March 24th and then did not work again until April 1st. After this date, he works on April 10th and 11th, but doesn't work after that until April 18th. On July 22nd, he takes a personal leave and doesn't return to work until August 12th. He works from that date to August 20th, but does not work after that date until September 22nd. He works again on September 30th and then does not work until October 28th. During the time when he was not working, this employee did not report to the Vancouver shortage.\n[74] Employee HI was working on a shortage at Hornepayne at the time of the recall. He worked on that shortage up until May 18th, 2005. After that he went home for a week and then went to Vancouver to cover the shortage on May 30th. He was later recalled to his home terminal on September 19th, 2005. He took a transfer to Fort Francis on October 29th and worked there until the end of the year.\n[75] According to the documents produced by CN, while he was in Vancouver, this employee started off by doing four (4) shifts of training. After he had completed his training on June 3rd, he only starts working on June 9th. Ms. Storms specified that it could well be that during that time he was still in training, although she did not know for sure. After June 9th, he is shown as available from June 17th to June 26th and then he is off work for miles. That means that he had been at the shortage location for a specified amount of time and he could go home for a few days. He did not work in Vancouver from June 16th to July 6th and from July 23rd to August 8th. He has another break on September 1st. His next working date is September 25th. On October 29th, as I've stated earlier, he is set up in Fort-Francis, but does not actually work there before December 22nd, 2005. When asked by the Complainant's counsel why an employee would be set up for almost two months and not work, Ms. Storms replied: I can't answer that.\n[76] Employee P was laid off at North Battleford on February 25th. On March 19th, he took a week vacation and then he was set up at his home terminal on March 26th. As already mentioned, when an employee is set up at his home terminal, he or she is no longer under an obligation to cover a shortage. Ms. Storms did emphasize though that being set up does not mean that the employee is working every day. In the case of Employee P, for example, from March 26th to the end of April, he only worked 7 days at his home terminal, but Ms. Storms added that we must be careful when looking at this information as those tours can last two (2) or three (3) days each, although no evidence confirming that this was the case for this employee was submitted. The employee was again laid off on April 24th, 2005. From that date to the rest of the year, this employee moved around within the Saskatchewan zone taking a clearance at other terminals.\n[77] The expression taking a clearance refers to the situation where a laid off employee with seniority in the Western region elects to go to another terminal where a position he can hold is available. When a position becomes available at his home terminal, the employee will return there. If an employee is exercising his seniority and takes a clearance, he or she is said to be working and will not have to report to cover a shortage.\n[78] Employee Y was also called to protect the shortage in Vancouver on February 25th, 2005. On that day he was on a leave of absence, but according to Ms. Storms, CMC would have contacted him within the next few days. Ms. Storms added that she had checked into this employee's work record and that it indicated that he was Absent without Leave on March 4th, 2005. This employee was eventually set up at his home terminal on March 15th, 2005. On April 9th, he was laid off again and then on April 30th, he was given a leave of absence by his trainmaster. That leave of absence lasted until May 13th when he was again laid off. On June 5th, he was again given a leave of absence until June 19th. On June 20th, he was set up in Saskatoon and worked there until July 1st and was laid off again on July 2nd. On July 9th, he was set up again in Saskatoon. On November 4th, he took a leave of absence and then on November 13th, he started training as a yardmaster. He trained as a yardmaster until Christmas and then he stayed on the working board until the end of the year.\n[79] Ms. Storms testified that this employee was dodgy and making himself unavailable. She added that when he was set up at this home terminal, he didn't have to report to cover the shortage, but when he was laid off in early April he should have reported, but did not. When asked by CN counsel why he had not been discharged for failing to report, she answered: I can't speak to that. His manager ... could have done something. I don't know exactly why, like I said, I think it just fell through the cracks. Because he was working, we didn't obviously keep very good tabs on him. Finally, on December 25th, 2005, this employee was set up in Saskatoon. On cross-examination, Ms. Storms added that his supervisor thought that he might need this employee, so he was not releasing him.\n[80] Employee U was called to cover the shortage in Vancouver at the same time as everyone else. Ms. Storms testified that she had personally talked to this employee and had been informed by him that his father was terminally ill. She added that she had then taken it upon herself to extend his time to report. This employee stayed on the laid off board until June 26th 2005, at which time he was given a leave of absence by the trainmaster at his terminal. On July 24th, he was set up at his home terminal. His father passed away in October and he booked off on bereavement leave. After that, he stayed at his home terminal for the remainder of the year.\n[81] Employee E was on laid off status when the recalled procedure started. Initially, when they started contacting employees for the shortage, the staff at CMC would just write notes in their work records as they were making the calls. But, because the shortage was so large, things were getting a little awkward and Ms. Storms instructed her staff to put charts together so that they could see where things were and how many people would cover the shortage. The information we find on these charts were gathered and recorded by different employees at CMC. The first chart was produced on March 7th, 2005. The last entry was for May 19th, 2005. After that, the list was discontinued. By that time Ms. Storms explained that most of the 47 recalled employees had responded or been dealt with.\n[82] The entry on these charts for March 16th, 2005, indicates that employee E had 15 days to report, 30 requested. G. Spanos pls advise or arrange travel. On April 20th, 2005, the entry shows Per Manitoba Zone [E] has been given a compassionate LOA until further notice - per Ron Smith - due to personal issue. [The emphasis is mine.] Ms. Storms explained that Ron Smith was the manager of the running trade employees for the Manitoba zone. Ms. Storms indicated that she knew a bit more about this employee's situation, because she had talked with his supervisor after the Seeley hearing. In response to questions put to her by CN's counsel, she explained that Employee E's situation was very similar to employee U. He also had a terminally ill parent and that would explain the entry of May 19th, 2005, which indicates Per Manitoba zone this individual has been given a compassionate [leave of absence] until further notice per A. Nashman and K. Carroll. Mr. Carroll was the general manager of the Vancouver, south division, at that time and Mr. Nashman was the general manager of the Western Operation Centre. Employee E was on a leave of absence until July 30th, 2005 and afterwards absent without leave from July 31st to September 8th. On September 10th, he is transferred to another terminal (Brandon, Manitoba) and, finally, he resigns on October 19th.\n[83] When asked on cross-examination why this employee had never reported to Vancouver, Ms. Storms testified that his supervisor had indicated that the employee had not reported to Vancouver because he was training him to be a supervisor, but that ultimately he resigned. This answer is not consistent with the answer she had given previously to CN's counsel, when she had stated that the situation of this employee was similar to that of Employee U.\n[84] Employee FG was shown on CN's Amended Statement of Particulars as having resigned, but at the hearing, Ms. Storms testified that this was a mistake. This employee had been recalled to the Vancouver shortage and he reported there on March 22nd, 2005. But from that date until September 21st, 2005, the employee was on sick leave. He was granted what is described as a leave of Absence under the Family Leave Act. When asked to explain what the Family Leave Act was, Ms. Storms answered that she did not know. A quick research, did not allow the Tribunal to identify any legislation bearing the name Family Leave Act. This employee resigned his position with CN on May 6th, 2006.\n[85] Employee O is showed in CN's Amended Statement of Particulars as having reported to Vancouver and to be still employed by CN. But, the documents produced at the hearing indicate that this employee did not report to Vancouver. He stayed in his home province, which according to Ms. Storms was using all of the employees that were there.\n[86] Employee QR was covering a shortage at Hornepayne when the recalled procedure started, so he did not have to report to Vancouver right away. After he finished covering the Hornepayne shortage, he did report to Vancouver but during the period of November 8th, 2005 to December 20th, 2005, he only worked three days. Before November 8th, he seemed to have been working pretty steadily. Ms. Storms testified that she could not speak for the period starting on November 8th, but she did add that there was still a shortage in Vancouver at that time.\n[87] Another employee, Employee M, reported to Vancouver on March 25th, 2005, but between that date and the end of 2005, the documents indicate that he only worked thirty four (34) shifts. More specifically, between September 17th and December 31st, he only worked ten (10) shifts. The documents show that this employee was absent a significant amount of time. The documents also indicate that between November 30th and December 31st, 2005, this employee was absent without leave. Ms. Storms testified that she had no idea of the reason for this absence. She added that only his supervisor could give a reason. This employee was not dismissed.\n[88] Employee A went to Vancouver for approximately two (2) months. On May 14th, 2005, he was transferred to Kenora. Ms. Storms testified that the supervisor who made the decision to set him up in Kenora expected or projected that there would be work for this employee at the terminal. But again, the documents indicate that from May 17th, 2005 to August 4th, 2005, this employee worked three (3) shifts in Kenora and that from November 1st to the end of December, he worked only seven (7) shifts. Ms. Storms testified that she could not speak for the reason why the supervisor at Kenora had decided to set this employee up, but she agreed that this person was not working very much.\n[89] Employee C reported to Vancouver on March 15th, 2005. He did work in Vancouver but was also marked as available on many occasions. On May 16th, 2005, he is set up in Kenora. From May 17th to July 9th, 2005, he worked three (3) days at that terminal and from October 20th to December 12th, 2005, the documents indicate that he did not work at all. Ms. Storms confirmed this information in her testimony.\n[90] Employee DE was also recalled to Vancouver on March 15th, 2005. He had a fairly regular pattern of work while in Vancouver. On June 18th 2005, he is transferred and set up in Terrace, but while there he does not work until September 23rd, date at which he is again transferred to Vancouver.\n[91] Another employee IJ was called to cover the shortage at Vancouver but did not have to report because he was then covering a shortage at another location. From March 17th to May 16th, while covering that shortage, the documents indicate that he only worked one (1) day (April 26th, 2005). From May 20th to May 27th, he was set up at his home terminal in Thunder Bay. From June 3rd to June 24th, he reported to Vancouver, but again the documents show that he is not working for several days. From July 16th to September 1st, he has a fairly steady pattern of work. On September 7th, he leaves Vancouver for Sioux Lookout, where he only works four (4) days up until October 27th, 2005. After that he is set up first at Brandon and then at Fort Francis.\n[92] Employee O did not report to Vancouver for various unexplained reasons. He is set up at his home terminal but the document show that during the period up to December his pattern of work at the terminal is very unsteady. Ms. Storms testified that this information sounded accurate and she added that it would be up to the terminal to release this employee and lay him off. If the terminal set him up and he is not working, there is not much CMC can do about it.\n[93] Employee W reported to Vancouver on April 14th, 2005. From that date until July 29th, he worked eighteen (18) days. July 29th, 2005, was his last day in Vancouver. On July 30th, this employee is transferred to his home terminal. He gets set up there but does not work from August 13th to September 19th. He works on September 20th, but then does not work again before November 12th, when he is transferred to another terminal for seven (7) days. He returns to his home terminal on November 19th, where he does not work until the end of the year. Ms. Storms testified that she does not know why this employee was not working.\n[94] In CN's Amended Statement of Particulars, employee BC is indicated as having resigned. But according to the documents submitted at the hearing it is indicated that this employee will be on Great West Life - long term insurance benefits. According to Ms. Storms, the dispatcher at CMC probably talked to this employee's supervisor. The employee was excused from reporting to Vancouver.\n[95] What the Tribunal concludes from this evidence is that many of the employees recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver either did not report and were not terminated or if they did report they were shown as being available for work on various days, but did not work.\n(v) The Complainant's recall to work [96] Before addressing the facts regarding the Complainant's recall to cover the shortage in Vancouver, the Tribunal notes that in her cross-examination Ms. Storms indicated that she did not personally keep a file specific to the Complainant's situation. She added that Joe Lyon, CN's Manager Operations, Crew Management Centre, Western Operations, and also the manager of the Board Adjustment Group, who reported directly to her, would most likely have kept the correspondence in a Vancouver shortage file and that the Complainant's letters would have been filed in her Personal Record files at CN. Mr. Lyon was not called as a witness, so it was impossible for the Tribunal to verify this information.\n[97] The Complainant testified that on March 17th, 2005, she received a letter from CN dated February 28, 2005. This letter was informing her that she was being recalled to the working board and required to protect a shortage of yard employees in Vancouver. The letter further instructed her that if she was unable to report to Vancouver within fifteen (15) days after being recalled, she was to contact the trainmaster in Vancouver. Upon receiving the letter, the Complainant contacted Mr. Spanos, the Trainmaster in Vancouver, and tried to explain to him her situation and how devastated her family was by the news, but she added that he did not seem interested; all he wanted to know was when she would show up in Vancouver.\n[98] On March 18th, 2005, the Complainant wrote to CN advising it that she had received the letter of February 28th, on March 17th, 2005. She asked for the thirty (30) days notice allowed pursuant to Article 115 of the Collective Agreement. She also explained that she was a single mother of two school-aged children and that the news of being forced to Vancouver had caused a great deal of anxiety for everyone involved. Her letter was addressed to CN and copied to the UTU Local in Jasper and to Joe Lyon, Colin Pizziol, Trainmaster Jasper, and George Spanos.\n[99] Ms. Storms testified that she didn't recall having seen this letter. She added that she knew by then that the Complainant had issues with child care and that it is why she had talked to Joe Torchia, CN's Director of Labour Relation, about the people who could not report and the Complainant was part of this group. She further added that it would have been normal to tell the Complainant to take this matter up with her supervisor, but she could not recall if that had been done or not.\n[100] For his part, Mr. Torchia testified that he was familiar with this letter. He believes he either received a copy of the letter or was informed of its content by CMC. His interpretation of this letter was that the Complainant was asking for more time to report and that was it. He then told Ms. Storms to grant the Complainant an extension of time to report.\n[101] There was no response from the Company to the Complainant's letter and no evidence of anybody from CN informing her that she had been granted an extension of time to report.\n[102] Mr. Torchia further testified that at about the same time, he received a call from Bryan Boechler, the General Chairperson of the Union, in respect to the Complainant, Kasha Whyte and Denise Seeley. He said that Mr. Boechler had indicated that these employees were having child care issues and he requested that they be granted more time to report to Vancouver. Mr. Torchia testified that he believes that, at that point, an extension had already been granted.\n[103] The spreadsheets prepared by the CMC regarding the recall do not support Mr. Torchia's evidence. On the sheet dated March 18\/05 as of 13:00 a notation in the row for the Complainant states: Message at residence to get medical done - wants 15 days. The notation marked in the row for K. Whyte reads 15 days to report. 30 requested - OK to March 29th per A. Nashman and in the row for D. Seeley, the notation states 16 days to report, 30 requested - OK to April 6th per A. Nashman.\n[104] In a letter dated April 25th, 2005, the Complainant was instructed by Mr. Lyon to advise CN, by May 6th, 2005, whether or not she would be reporting for work in Vancouver. The letter further advised the Complainant that failure to do so would result in her forfeiting her seniority and her services with the Company being dispensed with. Ms. Storms testified that she did not recall being involved in the drafting of this standard letter out of her office. She added that she was aware at that time that the Complainant had child care issues and that her understanding was that [she] was not going to report.\n[105] On May 1st, 2005, the Complainant wrote to Mr. Torchia requesting a compassionate leave of absence from protecting the shortage in Vancouver. In her correspondence, she states, inter alia, :\nI would ask that you would please consider the following, regarding the recent notification to protect the shortage in Vancouver, as this is a plea for compassion... I am a single mother of two school age children. My daughter is in grade 6 and will be reaching a major milestone in her life, she will graduate from the elementary school, where she has enjoyed her entire education, with her friends she has grown up with... My son is in grade 5 and is enjoying one of the best academic year of his education, where his improvement is substantial, he too is highly involved.... It should be noted that this is not an issue of finding appropriate child care. In accordance with the ruling of the Queen's Bench Court of Alberta, I provide primary residence for the two aforementioned children, with joint custody with their Father who lives in Jasper. This carries stipulations regarding taking my children away from their father, especially out of the province, including a ninety day written notice so it has time to be ruled upon by a judge. Their father takes a very active role in their lives and will not stand by and let me take the children away, especially with a court order providing for his rights. According to legal counsel, it would be highly unlikely that a judge would rule to uproot the children due to the instability of this situation...In your deliberation regarding this particular situation, I would ask for your compassion for my children as well as for two of your employees [herself and her husband]...based on the aforementioned reasons I would ask that CN grant me a compassionate leave of absence, from protecting the shortage in Vancouver, due to my legal requirements to remain in Jasper.\n[106] Mr. Torchia testified that when he received this letter he contacted CMC and instructed them to grant the Complainant an extension of time. He added that at this time, he was aware that three (3) employees at the Jasper terminal were looking for accommodation for very similar reasons. He added that he had received another letter prior to this one from Kasha Whyte and that is how he had been made aware of the situation. He said that he came to the conclusion, although he had never spoken with them, that what they needed was more time to make arrangements.\n[107] Mr. Torchia's evidence in regard to speaking to Ms. Storms is consistent with the information on the CMC spreadsheets. In his evidence, he said that he had given the Complainant and the two other women a 30 day extension. The notations on the spreadsheets for May2\/05 at 17:00, May 19\/05 at 10:30 and May 19\/05 at 17:00, indicate for all three women Child care - temporarily on hold per Joe Torchia.\n[108] According to Mr. Torchia, it is unusual for these types of questions to go directly to him. He added that employees making these kinds of request would normally address them to their supervisor. The supervisor would handle these demands directly and they would rarely rise to his level. But, on cross-examination, he testified that even if the Complainant had gone to her supervisor the result would have been the same, because the supervisor would have had to come to either Mr. Morris or himself for approval.\n[109] Ms. Storms testified that she does not recall having read the letter of May 1st, although a copy had been sent to Mr. Lyon. She added that she may have discussed it with Mr. Torchia, but she can't recall the specifics of this conversation. She also indicates that she was not aware that the Complainant had an issue with a custody order.\n[110] Since she had heard nothing further from Mr. Torchia and since CMC was calling her to take emergency trip, the Complainant assumed that her suggestion of staying in Jasper and doing emergency work had been accepted. As noted previously, the Complainant had booked OK for emergency trips in June 2005 and she had been called for nine (9) tours of duty during that period.\n[111] Mr. Torchia testified that in the last week of May or at the beginning of June 2005, he was at a meeting with Albert Nashman, CN's general manager of the Western Operation Centre, and Bryan Boechler, General Chairperson for the UTU. Although the meeting was about different issues, at one point Mr. Boehcler requested another extension for the Complainant and the other two employees. According to Mr. Torchia, he and Mr. Nashman granted a further extension until July 2nd, 2005. From Mr. Torchia's understanding, it was clear that this was the last extension that would be granted. On cross-examination, he testified that he was not aware if this decision had been conveyed to the Complainant. He further added that CN had accommodated the Complainant by granting her more time to report. He said that the possibility of granting a compassionate leave of absence never crossed his mind. He explained that a leave of absence was normally granted for reasons which were appropriate to the operational requirements of CN. He added however that he was not aware that some employees recalled to Vancouver had been granted leave of absence by their supervisors.\n[112] Mr. Torchia also testified on cross-examination that it was not fair to conclude that he had not applied CN's accommodation policy in this matter. He added that the Complainant had family status issues and that he had accommodated these by extending her time to report to Vancouver. He further added that the Complainant had been given more time to make arrangements, but that she hadn't and was therefore terminated.\n[113] On June 27th, 2005, the Complainant was informed by a letter from L. Gallegos, Manager Operation at CMC, that she must report to Vancouver by July 2nd, 2005. She was further advised that if she failed to report her seniority rights would be forfeited and her position with CN terminated. This letter also made reference to a telephone conversation on June 22nd, 2005, between the Complainant and Elaine Storms. During that conversation, Ms. Storms also informed the Complainant that she had to report to Vancouver by July 2nd, 2005 or her employment would be terminated.\n[114] The Complainant recalled this telephone conversation. She said that she told Ms. Storms that there must be a mistake and she asked her to speak to Joe Torchia about her situation. The Complainant thought that her situation had been dealt with because CN was allowing her to cover the emergency board in Jasper. The Complainant testified that she thought that this was the answer to her request for a compassionate leave of absence. Following the letter of June 27th, 2005, the Complainant was not allowed to cover anymore work on the emergency board.\n[115] Ms. Storms testified that she was aware at this point that the Complainant had an issue relating to her children. She indicated that she did not know the details of the situation. She added that she remembered parts of the telephone conversation of June 22nd, 2005. She testified that the Complainant had told her that she could not report to Vancouver because of child care issues. She further testified that she did not recall specifically if the Complainant had made a request for more time, but if that had been the case she would have referred her to her supervisor and to the Union. Ms. Storms also indicated that if the Complainant had indicated that she had an arrangement with Mr. Torchia, she would have called him and if he had indicated that he had allowed more time, she would have granted more time. But she further added that in her conversation with Mr. Torchia, he had clearly mentioned that the provisions of the Collective Agreement had to be applied in this case.\n[116] On cross-examination, Ms. Storms added that CN had a number of employees with issues with children at home, but she could not recall how many besides the Complainant, Kasha Whyte and Denise Seeley. She further added that it was kind of a general theme because so many people have children. During his cross-examination, Mr. Torchia testified that no other cases based on family issues, other than these three, had been brought to his attention. No other entries on the CMC spreadsheets, other than those for the Complainant, Denise Seeley and Kasha Whyte, mentioned family issues or child care issues to explain the failure to report to the shortage. Mr. Torchia also added that during his conversations with Ms. Storms he had not been informed that other employees had been exempted from reporting to Vancouver.\n[117] On June 22nd or 23rd, 2005, in an email in response to Ms. Storms' email recapping her telephone conversations with the Complainant, Mr. Torchia wrote: As far as I am concerned they [the complainant, Kasha Whyte and Denise Seeley] have been given enough time to sort out their personal affairs. If they wish to extend any further they will have to arrange with their supervisor. Brian Kalin, who was Mr. Pizziol's supervisor wrote on the same day: There are no further extensions. I agree with Joe - they've had several months to get their affairs in order. It's decision time for them now.. Brian Kalin was not called as a witness, so we have no details of what he knew about the Complainant circumstances. There is also no evidence that anybody from CN informed the Complainant that she should be dealing with her immediate supervisor, Mr. Pizziol, about her request to be excused from reporting to Vancouver.\n[118] Also of interest in the email chain that CN produced at the hearing is an email which Mr. Torchia testified as being from Albert Nashman. Mr. Torchia added that it had perhaps been pasted on from another email but he wasn't sure. He also could not make out the date of this email. This email stated: I talked to Boechler last night. Told him that we are not going to continue to delay this process. They have an obligation per the collective agreement to protect. I told him what are we suppose to tell the next group that says they don't want to go. If he wants to file a grievance then so be it. (The underlining is mine.)\n[119] The content of this email seems to be inconsistent with Mr. Torchia's prior evidence to the effect that he had made the decision that there would be no further extensions during the meeting at the end of May or in the first week of June with Mr. Nashman and Mr. Boechler. Yet this email seems to suggest that it is Mr. Nashman who had made this decision. Mr. Nashman was not called as a witness.\n[120] On July 2nd, 2005, the Complainant wrote to Peter Marshall, CN's Senior Vice-President for Western Canada. She again requested that CN consider her situation and grant her a compassionate leave of absence. She included in this letter a copy of her correspondence to Mr. Torchia. No response was received from Mr. Marshall or from his office.\n[121] On July 4th, 2005, CN wrote to the Complainant advising her as follows:\nThis letter will confirm as per Article 115 and 148 of Agreement 4.3 your seniority rights are forfeited and your services with the Company have been dispensed with. Your employment file is now closed.\n[122] Ms. Storms testified that she does not remember if she had spoken with the Complainant's supervisor before terminating the Complainant's employment, but she did add that as a general rule, the employer does not proceed with such a decision without talking first to the supervisor. She added that if she had not personally done so, Mr. Lyon would probably have spoken to the supervisor. Neither Mr. Pizziol, the Complainant's supervisor, nor Mr. Lyon were called as witnesses.\n[123] Ms. Storms added that she had followed Mr. Torchia's and Mr. Albert Nashman's directions to terminate the employment of the Complainant.\n[124] After her termination, the Complainant kept hoping that CN would review its position. She testified that in early 2006, she noticed that the Jasper yard was progressively growing short of employees. She therefore decided to write again to Mr. Marshall on February 6th, 2006, indicating that she was ready, willing and able and would gladly return to work in Jasper to help alleviate this shortage.\n[125] On February 16th, 2006, Mr. Marshall answered :\nUpon receipt of your letter, I reviewed your file and it is my understanding that your services were terminated under the terms of the collective agreement as a direct result of your failure to comply with the terms and conditions of that collective agreement. I appreciate the fact that you are now ready, willing and able to work and reinstatement would be considered provided you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of the collective agreement. I cannot, however, guarantee that you would work exclusively in Jasper. Your work location would be determined by your seniority and our work force requirement. Further, I understand that you currently have an active grievance regarding your termination and reinstatement would be conditional upon withdrawal of the grievance.\n[126] Following her termination, the Complainant requested that her Union process her grievance to arbitration. On April 12th, 2006, Arbitrator Picher rendered his award which was reported in Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration & Dispute Resolution (CROA), Case no. 3550. In his award the arbitrator states, inter alia:\nFor the reasons more exhaustively explained and expressed in CROA & DR 3549, the Arbitrator cannot accede to the position advanced by the Union. There is nothing in the collective agreement to suggest that the Company must carefully weigh the personal and family obligations of an employee and that those obligations might effectively trump the cornerstone rights and obligations relating to seniority and the order of recall of employees in a bargaining unit as provided for under the collective agreement. There is no responsible basis upon which a board of arbitration can effectively conclude that an individual's personal circumstances not only explain their failure to report for work upon a recall, but excuse them indefinitely, perhaps for years, from the same work obligations as apply to other employees, including other single parents, or married parents with comparable family obligations. In effect, what the grievor requests would be tantamount to an amendment of the collective agreement by the Arbitrator and the creation of a form of super-seniority based on personal circumstances. For reasons touched upon in the prior award, there is nothing in the collective agreement which would contemplate the possibility of any such result. On the contrary, the Arbitrator is bound to apply the seniority and recall provisions of the collective agreement as fashioned by the parties themselves. In addition, it should be noted that the Union does not seek, through this grievance, relief for any alleged violation of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n( The underlining is mine.)\n[127] CROA No. 3549 refers to the arbitration award in the Kasha Whyte matter. In this award, the arbitrator stated, inter alia :\nIn this grievance the Union does not plead any obligation of accommodation to the grievor under the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act, nor any other legislation. It submits that, in effect, the Company unreasonably failed to provide the grievor with a leave of absence to allow her to avoid the recall to Vancouver by reason of her personal circumstances.\n[...]\nAfter a careful review of the facts, the Arbitrator has considerable difficulty with the submission of the Union. Firstly, I must agree with the Company that in fact the grievor did not request a leave of absence. What she sought was a form of super-seniority which would allow her, unlike other employees, to remain laid off at Jasper, with no obligation to protect work elsewhere, while continuing to receive periodic calls to work from the emergency list at Jasper, as she had previously done. A leave of absence connotes a departure from the workplace, virtually for all purposes, whether for an indefinite period or for a period that is fixed. Those are not options which were being requested by Ms. Whyte... The grievor in the case at hand was not asking for an adjustment or accommodation in her work schedule. She was asking, in effect, for relief against one of the most fundamental obligations of the collective agreement, namely the obligation to protect work on her seniority territory in the event of a shortage of employees at any location.\n[...]\nI would have some difficulty in concluding that the Company was unreasonable or arbitrary in refusing to effectively grant to the grievor an amendment of her collective agreement obligations which might extend indefinitely, perhaps as long as ten years, while she would continue to have the special protected status as an employee who could only be compelled to work in Jasper.\n[...]\nThis grievance brings to the fore what must be recognized as a constant in any employment relationship, namely the tension between personal and family obligations and obligations to one's employer. Myriad circumstances might influence an employee's personal or family obligations: care for a child, care for an aged parent or another close relative or care for a spouse with a serious medical disability. Other personal circumstances might include parole or community service obligations after sentencing, close involvement with a church or social group, civic volunteering or competitive sports activities, to name but a few.\nA railway is, by its nature, a twenty-four hour, seven day a week enterprise. Persons who hire on to work, particularly in the running trades, know or reasonably should know that their hours of work will be irregular and that they will, on occasion, be compelled to change location to protect work as needed. In exchange for meeting those onerous obligations railway employees have gained the benefit of relatively generous wage and benefit protections.\nOn what basis can a board of arbitration, charged with interpreting and applying the terms of the collective agreement, conclude that the conditions of single parenthood can effectively trump the obligations of employment negotiated by the parties within the terms of their collective agreement? In a world where single parenthood is not uncommon that is not an inconsiderable question. As a general matter, boards of arbitration, including this Office, have confirmed that with respect to issues such as childcare the onus remains upon the employee, and not the employer, to ensure that familial obligations do not interfere with the basic obligations of the employment contract.\nIt is, of course, open to the parties to negotiate language within their collective agreement to provide possible relief from obligations of employment which would otherwise be borne by single parents or, for that matter, married parents with special needs. Likewise, Parliament or provincial legislatures could promulgate clear legislation to oblige employers to take such factors into account in the administration of contracts of employment and collective agreements. But as matters stand, the Arbitrator can find no discriminatory practice in the policy of the Company. It essentially requires all parents, whether single or married, to respond to their core employment obligations regardless of their personal or family circumstances. It obviously does occur, as in the case of the grievor, that extensions of time and other accommodations may be considered where hard personal circumstances are demonstrated. But in the end, all employees subject to the obligations of parenthood are treated the same, without discrimination based on the status of parenthood. In my view it would be highly inappropriate, when neither the parties nor Parliament have enacted such protection, for an arbitrator to extract from a provision such as article 115.4 and the phrase satisfactory reason for not responding to a recall, an effective annulment of an employee's most fundamental collective agreement obligation to be at work, in a manner tantamount to granting a form of super-seniority. If neither the parties themselves nor Parliament has ploughed any such new furrow, it is plainly not for an arbitrator to do so, bound as any board of arbitration is to apply the collective agreement as it stands. The conferring of what, in effect, would be indefinite and qualified partial parental leave is for the parties to negotiate or for the appropriate legislators to promulgate, should that be appropriate or desirable.\n(The underlining is mine.)\n[128] In reading arbitrator Picher, the Tribunal cannot but repeat what it said in Johnstone v. Canada Border Services, 2010 CHRT 20, regarding this award.\n[227] In Whyte the onus was put entirely on the employee to bear any burden associated with working for a twenty-four hour, seven day a week enterprise such as a railway. The decision finds that in exchange for meeting those onerous obligations railway employees have gained the benefit of relatively generous wage and benefit protections. This suggests that an employer can discriminate as long as it pays well, and without a definition as to what `relatively generous' means or what comparative is being used.\n[129] On April 1st, 2006, the Complainant filed her grievance with the CHRC.\nB. ISSUES [130] The issue raised in this case is as follows: has CN discriminated against the Complainant in the context of her employment contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA by failing to accommodate her and by terminating her employment on the ground of family status.\nC. THE LAW AND THEORY OF THE CASE (i) The relevant provisions of the CHRA [131] Section 3 of the CHRA states that family status is a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n(The emphasis is mine.)\n[132] Section 7 states :\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\nto refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, , par des moyens directs ou indirects;\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[133] Section 10 of the Act provides:\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\nto establish or pursue a policy or practice, or to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, l'association patronale or l'organisation syndicale;\nde fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite; (b) de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n[134] In considering sections 7 and 10, it is important to highlight the purpose of the CHRA as stated in section 2:\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de completer la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n[135] The Supreme Court of Canada and other Courts have consistently told us to interpret human rights in a large and liberal manner. In CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, the Court stated, at paragraph 24 :\n24. Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n(ii) The Law a) The prima facie case [136] The initial onus is on the complainant to establish a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent. (See Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons - Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558.)\n[137] Once a complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, he or she is entitled to relief in absence of a justification by the respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202, at p. 208.) In order to prove a prima facie case of discrimination, the Complainant must, in this case, establish that she was treated in an adverse differential manner and was terminated because of her family status, contrary to section 7 of the CHRA.\nb) What approach is to be applied to determine whether there has been discrimination on the ground of family status? [138] The evaluation of whether there is discrimination on the ground of family status is carried out according to the test set out in Public Service Labour Relations Commission v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3 (Meiorin), just as it would be for any other prohibited ground of discrimination. However, in recent years, the interpretation of the notion of family status has led to the creation of two distinct schools of thought. Some cases have adopted a broad approach towards the scope of family status, while other have taken a more narrow approach. In order to better understand what is included in the notion of family status we will review a certain number of these cases.\n[139] In Schaap v. Canada (Dept. of National Defence) [1988] C.H.R.D. No. 4, the Tribunal was considering whether relationships formed in a common-law relationship as opposed to those in a legal marriage fell within the protected groups of marital status and family status. In its decision, the Tribunal found the need for a blood or legal relationship to exist and defined family status as including both blood relationships between parent and child and the inter-relationship that arises from bonds of marriage, consanguinity or legal adoption, including, of course, the ancestral relationship, whether legitimate, illegitimate or by adoption, as well as the relationships between spouses, siblings, in-laws, uncles or aunts and nephews or nieces. In Lang v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission, [1990] C.H.R.D. No. 8, the Tribunal stated at page 3: The Tribunal is of the view that the words family status include the relationship of parent and child.\n[140] In Brown v. Department of National Revenue (Customs and Excise), (1993) T.D. 7\/93, the Tribunal held at pages 15 and 20:\nWith respect to ground (b) [family status], the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer.\n[...]\nIt is not suggested by counsel for the Complainant that the employer is responsible for the care and nurturing of a child. She was advocating however that there was a balance of interest and obligation as set out in s. 2 and 7(b) of the C.H.R.A. which must be recognized within the context of family status.\nA parent must therefore carefully weigh and evaluate how they are best able to discharge their obligations as well as their duties and obligations within the family. They are therefore under an obligation to seek accommodation from the employer so that they can best serve those interests.\nWe can therefore understand the obvious dilemma facing the modern family wherein the present socio-economic trends find both parents in the work environment, often with different rules and requirements. More often than not, we find the natural nurturing demands upon the female parent place her invariably in the position wherein she is required to strike this fine balance between family needs and employment requirements.\n[141] The Tribunal finally concluded that the purposive interpretation to be affixed to the CHRA was a clear recognition that within the context of family status it is a parent's right and duty to strike that balance coupled with a clear duty on the part of the employer to facilitate and accommodate that balance within the criteria set out by the jurisprudence. The Tribunal added that to consider any lesser approach to the problems facing the modern family within the employment environment is to render meaningless the concept of family status as a ground of discrimination.\n[142] The Tribunal also considered family status as a ground of discrimination in Hoyt v. Canadian National Railway, [2006] C.H.R.D. No. 33. In this decision, the Tribunal referred to a judicial definition of the term family status, as well as to prior decisions of the Tribunal which set forth requirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination based on that ground. The Tribunal specifically stated :\n117 Discrimination on this ground has been judicially defined as ... practices or attitudes which have the effect of limiting the conditions of employment of, or the employment opportunities available to, employees on the basis of a characteristic relating to their ... family. (Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Mr. A et al [2000] O.J. No. 4275 (C.A.); affirmed [2002] S.C.J. No. 67].\n118 This Tribunal has considered the evidentiary requirements to establish a prima facie case in a decision that predates the Ontario case, though is clearly consistent with its definition:\n... the evidence must demonstrate that family status includes the status of being a parent and includes the duties and obligations as a member of society and further that the Complainant was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with an employer rule, the Complainant was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with her employer (Brown v. Canada (Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise) [1993] C.H.R.D. No. 7, at p. 13. See also Woiden et al v. Dan Lynn, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 18, T.D. 09\/02)\n[143] However, a different enunciation of the evidence necessary to demonstrate a prima facie case was articulated by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia v. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. No. 922, at paragraphs 38 and 39, a decision on which CN put a lot of weight during its closing arguments. In that decision the British Columbia Court of Appeal decided that the parameters of family status as a prohibited ground of discrimination in the Human Rights Code of British Columbia should not be drawn too broadly or it would have the potential to cause disruption and great mischief' in the workplace. The Court directed that a prima facie case is made out when a change in a term or condition of employment imposed by an employer results in serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation of the employee. (The underlining is mine.) Low, J.A. observed that the prima facie case would be difficult to make out in cases of conflict between work requirements and family obligations.\n[144] In Hoyt, this Tribunal did not follow the approach suggested in the Campbell River case. The Tribunal summarized its position in regards to that case as follows:\n120 With respect, I do not agree with the [British Columbia Court of Appeal's] analysis. Human rights codes, because of their status as fundamental law, must be interpreted liberally so that they may better fulfill their objectives (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at p. 547, Canadian National Railway Co. v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114 at pp. 1134-1136; Robichaud v. Canada (Treasury Board) [1987] 2 S.C.R. 84 at pp. 89-90). It would, in my view, be inappropriate to select out one prohibited ground of discrimination for a more restrictive definition.\n121 In my respectful opinion, the concerns identified by the Court of Appeal, being serious workplace disruption and great mischief, might be proper matters for consideration in the Meiorin analysis and in particular the third branch of the analysis, being reasonable necessity. When evaluating the magnitude of hardship, an accommodation might give rise to matters such as serious disruption in the workplace, and serious impact on employee morale are appropriate considerations (see Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission) [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489 at pp. 520 - 521). Undue hardship is to be proven by the employer on a case by case basis. A mere apprehension that undue hardship would result is not a proper reason, in my respectful opinion, to obviate the analysis. (The underlining is mine.)\n[145] In addition to the compelling logic of the Tribunal's decision in Hoyt for not following the approach in Campbell River, this Tribunal concludes that the approach suggested in that case imposes an additional burden on the Complainant by suggesting that the protected ground of family status includes proof of a serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation and that this is inconsistent with the purpose of the CHRA. As the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear in B. v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission), [2002] 3 S.C.R. 403, at para. 56, it is not appropriate, when interpreting human rights statutes, to impose additional burdens.\n[146] The Tribunal's approach in Hoyt was cited by the Federal Court of Canada in Johnstone v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J. No. 43, at paragraphs 29-30. This was an application for judicial review by Ms. Johnstone of the decision of the CHRC to not refer her complaint alleging family status discrimination to the Tribunal.\n[147] In Johnstone, the Federal Court agreed with the approach of the Tribunal in Hoyt in regards to discrimination on the basis of family status, and stated that ...there is no obvious justification for relegating this type of discrimination to a secondary or less compelling status. (Johnstone, supra, at para. 29). The Court also stated that the suggestion of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in the Campbell River case that prima facie discrimination will only arise where the employer changes the conditions of employment seems to be unworkable and, with respect, wrong in law. (Johnstone, supra, at para.29). The Court also found that the serious interference test which the Court viewed as the approach apparently adopted by the CHRC for not sending the matter to the Tribunal, fail[ed] to conform with other binding authorities which have clearly established the test for a finding of prima facie discrimination. (Johnstone, supra, at para. 30.)\n[148] The Federal Court's decision in Johnstone was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, although the Court of Appeal stated that it was not expressing an opinion on the proper version of the test in relation to prima facie discrimination on the ground of family status. Instead the Federal Court of Appeal based its reasoning on the finding that the failure of the CHRC to clearly identify the test it applied was a valid basis for finding the decision of the Commission to be unreasonable. ([2008] F.C.J. No. 427, at para. 2).\n[149] The Tribunal has recently rendered its decision in the Johnstone matter (see Johnstone v. Canada Border Services, 2010 CHRT 20). In that decision the Tribunal[220]\n[220] This Tribunal agrees that not every tension that arises in the context of work-life balance can or should be addressed by human rights jurisprudence, but this is not the argument put forward in the present case. Ms. Johnstone's argument is that such protection should be given where appropriate and reasonable given the circumstances as presented.\n[221] As discussed above, we are addressing here a real parent to young children obligation and a substantial impact on that parent's ability to meet that obligation. It is not before this Tribunal to address any and all family obligations and any and all conflict between an employee's work and those obligations.\n[...]\n[230] [...] this Tribunal finds nothing in Section 2 that creates a restrictive and narrow\ninterpretation of `family status'.\n[231] To the contrary, the underlying purpose of the Act as stated is to provide all individuals a mechanism to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society... It is reasonable that protections so afforded include those naturally arising from one of the most fundamental societal relationships that exists, that of parent to child. The fact that the language of Section 2 mentions lives that they are able and wish to have carries with it the acknowledgement that individuals do make separate choices, including to have children, and that the Act affords protection against discrimination with respect to those choices.\n[...]\n[233] This Tribunal finds that the freedom to choose to become a parent is so vital that it should not be constrained by the fear of discriminatory consequences. As a society, Canada should recognize this fundamental freedom and support that choice wherever possible. For the employer, this means assessing situations such as Ms. Johnstone's on an individual basis and working together with her to create a workable solution that balances her parental obligations with her work opportunities, short of undue hardship.\n[150] Recently the Public Service Staffing Tribunal (the PSST) considered whether to follow the approach to family status set out in Hoyt or in Campbell River and determined that it would apply the Hoyt approach. In Chantal Rajotte v. The President of the Canada Border Services Agency et al, 2009 PSST 0025, the PSST stated that the proper approach to be followed is the one set out in Hoyt which is also recognized by the Federal Court in Johnstone. (para. 127.) The PSST further stated:\nAccordingly, the evidence must demonstrate that the complainant is a parent, that she has duties and obligations as a member of society, and further that she was a parent incurring those duties and obligations. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, combined with the respondent's conduct, the complainant must prove she was unable to participate equally and fully in employment. ( para 127.)\n[151] A review of some recent cases out of the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal (the BCHRT) demonstrates that the decisions of that Tribunal are not consistently following the approach in Campbell River. For example, it has not been found to be applicable in the case of provision of services (Stephenson v. Sooke Lake Modular Home Co-operative Association, 2007 BCHRT 341). It has also been distinguished in two BCHRT decisions involving an employment situation (Haggerty v. Kamloops Society for Community Living, [2008] BCHRT 172, par. 17 and Mahdi v. Hertz Canada Limited, [2008] BCHRT 245, paras. 60 and 61).\n[152] In Falardeau v. Ferguson Moving (1990) Ltd., dba Ferguson Moving and Storage et al., 2009 BCHRT 272, the BCHRT referred to the Campbell River, Hoyt and Johnstone decisions, and also to another of its decision in Miller v. BCTF (No. 2), 2009 BCHRT 34. The BCHRT pointed out that in Miller, it had stated that Campbell River applied only in the context from which it arose. It cited the following statement from Miller: The [Campbell River] formulation of what is necessary to establish discrimination on the basis of family status in the context of competing employment and family obligations is not applied mechanically in all cases of alleged discrimination on the basis of family status. (Falardeau, at para. 29.)\n[153] The issue in Falardeau concerned whether an employee, who had refused to do overtime because of child care responsibilities for his son, had been discriminated against on the ground of family status. The Tribunal found that the complainant had not established a prima facie case. The Tribunal stated at paras 31 and 32:\nIn the present case, Ferguson sought to maintain a well-established pattern of overtime hours to meet the needs of its customers. To the extent Mr. Falardeau made the respondents aware of his child-care needs and arrangements, they thought, correctly on the evidence before me, that he was readily able to obtain coverage for his son's care if his work hours were extended. Indeed, he had done so on many occasions. The fact that neither the pattern of Mr. Falardeau's work, nor his childcare demands or arrangements had changed, suggests that he may have made an issue of overtime because of his dislike of work on construction sites, rather than because of his family responsibilities.\nThere was no evidence that his son had any special needs, or that Mr. Falardeau was uniquely qualified to care for him. Although these factors are not required to establish a substantial parental obligation, the evidence in this case established no other factors which would take Mr. Falardeau's case out of the ordinary obligations of parents who must juggle the demands of their employment, and the provision of appropriate care to their children. I am unable on these facts to find a serious interference with a substantial parental or other family duty or obligation. (The underlining is mine.)\n[154] The BCHRT in Farlardeau was essentially following the reasoning formulated in the Campbell River case. But even if it had followed the Hoyt approach, its conclusion might not have been different. The main difference between the situation in Falardeau and in the present case is that in Falardeau there had been no changes in Mr. Falardeau pattern of work or in his childcare demands or arrangements. Furthermore, his employer had been made aware of Mr. Falardeau's child-care needs and arrangements and it thought, rightly, that Falardeau was readily able to obtain coverage for his son's care if his work hours were extended. Therefore, Mr. Falardeau had not been able to make out a prima facie case on the ground of family status, as he had not proven that he was unable to participate equally and fully in employment as a consequence of his duties and obligations as a parent.\n[155] In the present case, the Complainant by being forced to cover a shortage in Vancouver was facing a serious interference with her parental duties and obligations. The matter might have been different had the Complainant refused to be set up at her home terminal.\n[156] In his closing arguments CN's counsel argued that the Complainant's position was based on an incorrect premise. He qualified the complaint as a request that the employer accommodate the Complainant's parental preferences and lifestyle choices. He added that this position was based on an exceedingly broad interpretation of the CHRA and that the only characteristic raised by the Complainant as triggering protection under the Act is the fact that she is a parent and as such must see to the upbringing of her children. Counsel further submitted that requiring an employee who is a parent to comply with his or her responsibility to report to work as required by the collective agreement does not amount to discrimination prima facie. Rather, he argued that the refusal by an employee to comply with his or her responsibilities in this regard amounts to a choice which is exclusively personal in nature and which, absent exceptional circumstances, no employer is obligated to accommodate. Accordingly, he concluded that upholding the complaint in this case would amount to adding parental preferences to the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in the CHRA under the guise of an expansion of the notion of family status.\n[157] In support of his arguments, Counsel referred to numerous cases and awards, including the British Columbia's Court of Appeal decision in Campbell River which he suggested presented a more structured and pragmatic approach than the Tribunal's decision in Hoyt. He also made reference to an arbitration award in Canadian Staff Union v. Canadian Union of Public Employees, (2006) 88 C.L.A.S. 212. In this case, the grievor had refused to relocate to Halifax after having applied for a job which indicated that the place of work would be Halifax. The grievor resided in St. John's, Newfoundland, where he had shared custody of his children with his former spouse. He also was responsible for the care of his aging mother. The union argued that the notion of family status was not limited to the status of being a parent per se, but also extended to the accommodation of the grievor's family responsibilities.\n[158] According to the award, the grievance raised important issues of human rights law which were summarized as follows: whether an employer's designation of a specific geographic location in a job posting, and insistence that an employee who wished to hold that job live where he or she can report regularly to work at that location prima facie constitutes discrimination on the basis of marital status or family status, if the employee's marital and family responsibilities effectively preclude him or her from living where he or she can report regularly to work at the specified location. (at para. 6.)\n[159] The arbitrator dismissed the grievance on the ground that for the purposes of any statute relevant here, and the Collective Agreement, it was the Grievor's choice, not his marital and family responsibilities, that precluded him from moving to Halifax. (at para. 9.) The arbitrator added: what the Employer did here did not constitute prima facie discrimination on the basis of marital status or family status and the Employer was not required by law to accommodate the Grievor to the point of undue hardship.\n[160] In his analysis of the relevant cases, the arbitrator adopted the narrower approach of Campbell River in regards to the interpretation of family status. Although interesting, the Tribunal notes that the facts relevant to this award are in many regards different from those in the present case. In that case, the grievor had applied for a job, knowing full well that the job description indicated that it was to be located in Halifax. The grievor had a choice, he could decline to go to Halifax and remain in his position in St. John's, which is not the case for the Complainant whose choice was either to report to Vancouver for an undetermined amount of time or see her employment relationship terminated. The facts also indicate that there was no significant increase in pay or benefits involved between the job in Halifax and the one in St. John's and that the grievor had applied for the job posted because he wanted a change and new challenges (para. 15). The Tribunal also notes that the grievor's children were 19 years old, starting university, and 15, starting high school, and, as indicated by the arbitrator, although the grievor's sons undoubtedly benefited greatly from his regular presence in St. John's, they required no special care from him, and he could make arrangement for their maintenance in his absence. (Para. 141.)\n[161] CN counsel also made reference to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal's decision in Wight v. Ontario (No 2), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/191, which dealt with an employee who, at the expiry of her maternity leave, refused to return to work claiming that she was unable to make appropriate daycare arrangements. Her employment was thereafter terminated on the ground that she had abandoned her position. In this case the Tribunal found that the Complainant had steadfastly refused to acknowledge her employer's reasonable expectations that she would take whatever steps are necessary to return to work when her maternity leave would expire. In the Tribunal words: She had decided she was going to be on a maternity leave until October at the earliest or January at the latest. (para. 321). The Tribunal added that this was not a case of someone who, despite her best efforts, could not find day care for her child and had to make a choice between her child and her job. Again a factual situation which is very different from the present one.\n[162] Counsel also made reference to Smith v. Canadian National Railway, 2008 CHRT 15, a decision rendered in May 2008, by the then Tribunal Chairperson. The Tribunal fails to see how this decision can be said to be comparable to the present situation. In the Smith case, although the complainant did assert, amongst other ground, that he had been discriminated against on the basis of family status, the Tribunal found that this ground of discrimination had not been raised in the complaint and that no jurisprudence was presented as to whether the facts amounted to family status discrimination. (para. 289.)\n[163] CN's counsel finally referred the Tribunal to a series of awards rendered by the Canadian Railway Office of Arbitration (CROA). Although interesting, all the CROA decisions are founded on their particular facts and do not help us in the determination of the proper test to follow in this case.\n[164] The Tribunal also disagrees with CN's argument that an open-ended concept of family status would open up the floodgates and that it would have the potential of causing disruption and great mischief in the workplace. As the Human Rights and Citizenship Commission of Alberta noted at para. 242 of its decision in Rawleigh v. Canada Safeway Ltd, decision rendered on September 29, 20009, every case must be weighed on its own merits and unique circumstances. To support the belief that the floodgate may be opened to opportunistic individuals is very dangerous and possibly discriminatory.\n[165] The Supreme Court of Canada and other Courts have consistently held that that human rights must be interpreted in a large and liberal manner. In CNR v. Canada (Human Rights Commission) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1114, the Court stated, at paragraph 24:\n24. Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst other things, to individual rights of vital importance, rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a court of law. I recognize that in the construction of such legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain meaning, but it is equally important that the rights enunciated be given their full recognition and effect. We should not search for ways and means to minimize those rights and to enfeeble their proper impact. Although it may seem commonplace, it may be wise to remind ourselves of the statutory guidance given by the federal Interpretation Act which asserts that statutes are deemed to be remedial and are thus to be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as will best ensure that their objects are attained.\n[166] From the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that there are two different interpretations in the case law with regard to a prima facie case of discrimination based on family status: the one in Campbell River and the one in Hoyt. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the effect of the approach in Campbell River is to impose a hierarchy of grounds of discrimination, some grounds, as the ground of family status, being deemed less important than others. This approach is not supported by the purpose of the CHRA. Furthermore, all the permutations of the approach applied to the ground of family status in British Columbia subsequent to the Campbell River decision, support the Tribunal's conclusion that family status should not be singled out for a different and more onerous or more stringent prima facie standard. The only solution is to apply the same test as for the other grounds enumerated in section 3 of the CHRA. This approach was accepted in Hoyt and approved by the Federal Court in Johnstone.\n[167] I will therefore follow the approach in Hoyt which is consistent with human rights principles in treating all prohibited grounds of discrimination as equal.\n[168] Furthermore, taking into account the special nature and status of human rights legislation as a quasi-constitutional legislation, the Tribunal concludes that the interpretation and application of family status proposed in Hoyt is the proper one to adopt. As stated earlier, human rights legislation must be given a liberal and purposive interpretation, in which protected rights receive a broad interpretation, while exceptions and defenses are narrowly construed.\nc) Has a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status been made out? [169] After considering all the evidence, the Tribunal, applying the Hoyt approach, concludes that the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of family status. As a result of her family obligation she lost her employment while other employees did not.\n[170] The evidence establishes that the Complainant is divorced and that she has the primary custody of her two children who in July of 2005 were 10 and 11 years old. The Divorce Order and custody agreement stated that the two parents would have joint and shared custody of the children, the Complainant providing the primary residence for them. It was further ordered that neither party was to reside outside Jasper with the children, without giving the other party ninety (90) days written notice of the move.\n[171] In 2005, the Complainant was on lay-off status with CN. In February 2005, she was asked by CN how long it would take her to report to a shortage in Vancouver. As already noted, the custody order obligated her to provide ninety (90) days notice should she want to relocate her children away from their father. Given the unknown length of time the shortage would last and the difficulties involved in uprooting her children from their schools, their father, friends and community, she testified that it was impossible for her to go to Vancouver to cover the shortage.\n[172] The Complainant wrote to CN explaining her family situation and the difficulties related to her family status. She told CN that she could not report to Vancouver and asked for a compassionate leave of absence. On March 18th, 2005, she again wrote to CN explaining that although the thirty (30) days would be adequate for a notice to her present employer, her difficulties and unique circumstances as a single mother would not allow her to report to Vancouver. In another letter dated May 1st, 2005, she explained the circumstances of her family and child care situation directly to Mr. Torchia and stated that to move her children to Vancouver was not an option.\n[173] The evidence establishes that Conductors on the railway have an unpredictable work schedule and yet the Complainant had made the necessary arrangements to fulfill the full range of her duties as a Conductor, including being on a 2 hour call 7 days a week, for work out of Jasper. The only issue for her was that she could not leave her family in Jasper at the time of the Vancouver shortage.\n[174] The Complainant never received any answer to any of her letters. CN's witnesses testified that parental responsibilities such as child care were not a satisfactory reason to not protect a shortage. CN considered that the complainant's situation did not qualify as requiring accommodation on the basis of family status under the CHRA. It also considered the Complainant's situation as a personal choice not to abide by her professional obligations in order to prioritize other aspects of her life, a situation it referred to as work-life balance.\n[175] On cross-examination, Mr. Torchia recognized that the Complainant concerns were legitimate and that they did deserve accommodation. But, for him what the Complainant needed was more time to sort out her affairs and that is what he had granted her. He also added that it was unfair to conclude that he had not applied CN's Accommodation Policy: They [the Complainant, Kasha Whyte and Denise Seeley] had family issues and I accommodated them by extending the time they had to report to Vancouver. They were accommodated to make arrangements. They didn't and were terminated. Interestingly, he also added: In the case of the two Complainants [Cindy Richards and Kasha Whyte], I felt that they had satisfactory reasons and that is why I granted them an extension of time when I found out about them. This was not the position adopted by CN before the arbitrator.\n[176] The Tribunal concludes that the law simply does not support CN's view of family status as not including the Complainant's situation. The Complainant situation as a single parent of two children and the ramifications, as she explained in her various letters, of ordering her to Vancouver does bring her within the ground of family status. She specifically requested accommodation of CN and had directed her request to CN officials. CN's witnesses testified that such a request should have been made to the employee's supervisor who in this case was Colin Pizziol, the trainmaster in Jasper. Unfortunately, Mr. Pizziol was not called as a witness and CN's other witnesses could not testify to how he had dealt with this situation. The unchallenged evidence of the Complainant was that neither her supervisor, nor any other managers of CN, had ever responded to her letters, nor discussed her situation with her.\n[177] In regards to the evidence submitted at the hearing, the Tribunal concludes that the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination based on the ground of family status. The evidence demonstrates that the Complainant was a parent and that this status included the duties and obligations generally incurred by parents. As a consequence of those duties and obligations, the Complainant, because of CN's rules and practices, was unable to participate equally and fully in employment with CN. This being the case, the onus now shifts to CN to demonstrate that the prima facie discriminatory standard or action it adopted is a bona fide occupational requirement.\nd) Did CN provide accommodation to the Complainant? [178] To evaluate whether there has been discrimination on a prohibited ground in an employment context, and whether an employer has accommodated an employee up to the point of undue hardship, the applicable test is the one set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada in Meiorin. In that decision, the Supreme Court of Canada standardized the test applicable to discrimination and rejected the old distinction between direct and indirect discrimination.\n[179] Once the Complainant has established a prima facie case of discrimination, the onus shifts to the employer to demonstrate that the prima facie discriminatory standard or action is a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR). In this regard, the Supreme Court of Canada has stated at paragraphs 54 and 55 of the Meiorin :\nAn employer may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\nthat the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job; that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\nThis approach is premised on the need to develop standards that accommodate the potential contributions of all employees in so far as this can be done without undue hardship to the employer. Standards may adversely affect members of a particular group, to be sure. But as Wilson J. noted in Central Alberta Dairy Pool, supra, at p. 518, [i]f a reasonable alternative exists to burdening members of a group with a given rule, that rule will not be [a BFOR]. It follows that a rule or standard must accommodate individual differences to the point of undue hardship if it is to be found reasonably necessary. Unless no further accommodation is possible without imposing undue hardship, the standard is not a BFOR in its existing form and the prima facie case of discrimination stands.\nWas the standard adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job?\n[180] The neutral rule in question here is the requirement to report for work in Vancouver to cover the shortage. In her closing argument, Complainant's counsel stated that she did not challenge that the ability of CN to require unprotected employees to be forced to cover shortage was rationally connected to its stated purpose of being able to move workers quickly to those locations which were short to allow it to keep its trains moving. She added that the rule itself includes the ability of a Conductor to not go when forced if there is a satisfactory reason.\nDid the employer adopt the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of that legitimate work-related purpose?\n[181] Again the Complainant does not challenge the honest and good faith belief that from an operational point of view CN needed the ability to force unprotected employees to cover shortages. The evidence from both the Union representatives and CN was that these provisions were negotiated as part of the Collective Agreement. CN witnesses also testified that once the Furlough Boards were established, it did not expect to get many volunteers to cover shortages and that is why it negotiated the ability to force unprotected employees on lay off to address that problem.\nHas CN established that it could not accommodate the Complainant without undue hardship?\n[182] CN's third and final hurdle is to demonstrate that the impugned standard is reasonably necessary for the employer to accomplish its purpose. At this stage, CN must establish that it cannot accommodate the Complainant and others adversely affected by the standard without experiencing undue hardship. In other words, since the Complainant was adversely affected on the ground of her family status by the standard of forcing employees to cover shortages, could CN accommodate her without experiencing undue hardship?\n[183] The use of the term undue infers that some hardship is acceptable. It is only undue hardship that satisfies this test. (See Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970, at page 984.) It may be ideal for an employer to adopt a practice or standard that is uncompromisingly stringent, but if it is to be justified it must accommodate factors relating to the unique capabilities and inherent worth and dignity of every individual, up to the point of undue hardship. (Meiron, supra, at para. 62.) Furthermore, when an employer is assessing whether it can accommodate an employee it must do an individualized assessment of the employee's situation. In this regard, in McGill University Health Centre (Montr\u00e9al General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 161, at para. 22, the Supreme Court of Canada stated: The importance of the individualized nature of the accommodation process cannot be minimized.\n[184] In Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489, at pages 520-21, Wilson J. addressed the factors that may be considered when assessing an employer's duty to accommodate an employee to the point of undue hardship. Amongst the relevant factors are the financial cost of the possible method of accommodation, the relative interchangeability of the workforce and facilities and the prospect of substantial interference with the rights of other employees. It was also stated that a standard or practice that excludes members of a particular group on impressionistic assumptions is generally suspect. (British Columbia (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia Council of Human Rights, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 868 (Grismer), at para. 31). Employers must be innovative yet practical when considering accommodation options in particular circumstances.\n[185] In his closing arguments, CN's counsel suggested that the Supreme Court of Canada had restated the principles applying to the notion of undue hardship in its decision in Hydro Qu\u00e9bec v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), [2008] 2 S.C.R. 561. The Tribunal does not accept this interpretation of the decision in Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec. On the contrary, the Tribunal finds this decision to be consistent with previous decisions of the Supreme Court on the issue of accommodation. In Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, the Court stated that although the employer does not have a duty to change the working conditions in a fundamental way, it does have the duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee's workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work. (par. 16). The Court also stated that [b]ecause of the individualized nature of the duty to accommodate and the variety of circumstances that may arise, rigid rules must be avoided. If a business can, without, undue hardship, offer the employee a variable work schedule or lighten his or her duties - or even authorize staff transfers - to ensure that the employee can do his or her work, it must do so to accommodate the employee. (par. 17.) (See also Jonhstone v. Canada Border Services, supra, at para. 218.)\n[186] CN argues that if accommodation was required under the CHRA, reasonable accommodation was provided when they granted the Complainant more than four (4) months to report to Vancouver, rather than the minimum fifteen (15) days set out in the Collective Agreement. CN further states that granting the relief sought by the Complainant would constitute undue hardship because it would effectively grant all employees who are parents an equivalent to super seniority under the Collective Agreement solely on the basis of their status as parents.\n[187] I will address first the claim that reasonable accommodation was provided.\n[188] CN argues that providing extra time to the Complainant to report to Vancouver was all that it was required to do. However, the evidence clearly shows that this was not in any way a meaningful response to the Complainant's request and to the factual underpinnings of her situation which she had communicated to the employer through her various letters. The evidence also shows that the decision was made without anybody from CN discussing it with the Complainant.\n[189] The evidence establishes that the Complainant wrote to Mr. Torchia and to other senior managers at CN setting out the details of her family situation and her assessment of why her family duties and responsibilities prevented her from reporting to the shortage in Vancouver. She also specifically requested a compassionate leave of absence. The Complainant had further clearly indicated that she was ready and willing to cover all aspects of her job as a Conductor in Jasper where she had the necessary child care and family supports.\n[190] The evidence clearly establishes that CN was not sensitive to the Complainant's situation. It did not answer her many requests for some form of accommodation and did not even meet or contact her to discuss her situation, even though its own accommodation policy directs that the employee be met as a first step in the process. It is also clear from the evidence of Mr. Storms and of Mr. Torchia that they did not feel that they had any responsibility regarding any issue pertaining to the CHRA. They both testified that the supervisor of the employee and Human Resources were the ones with whom this issue should have been raised. Unfortunately, as stated earlier, Mr. Pizziol, the Complainant supervisor, was not called as a witness and neither was Ms. Mary-Jane Morrison, the person responsible for Human Resources in Edmonton in 2005. According to CN counsel, Mr. Pizziol does not work for CN anymore and Ms. Morrison was unavailable for personal reasons.\n[191] It is clear that CN witnesses did not consider family status - at least, family status matters that involve parental obligations and responsibilities - as a ground of discrimination that necessitated any form of accommodation. In their conception of the various grounds of discrimination set out in the CHRA, they seem to have chosen some grounds as opening a right to accommodation and others that did not. For example, they testified that CN had not hesitated to accommodate some employees who were recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver because of a sick parent. They also acknowledge that CN had in the past accommodated employees for medical reason. But without inquiring into the nature of her request, they decided that the Complainant's situation did not qualify as one requiring accommodation under the CHRA.\n[192] The evidence of Mr. Torchia is that he was aware of the Complainant's situation and that he had come to the conclusion that what she needed was more time to sort out her affairs. He never had any discussion with the Complainant, nor did he delegate the matter to another manager so that he could discuss the Complainant's request with her. He felt that he knew what she needed and that he had given her what she needed.\n[193] For her part, Ms. Storms, who was monitoring the CMC spreadsheets, knew that the Complainant's situation had been labeled child care issue. In her evidence she suggested that many of the employees recalled had also raised child care issues and that it was becoming a general theme. However, no other employees, other than the Complainant, Denise Seeley and Kasha Whyte, had child care noted on the spreadsheets and Mr. Torchia testified that he knew of no other cases but these where child care issues had been raised.\n[194] Since it was her department who was supervising the information concerning the recalled employees, Ms. Storms had the opportunity to initiate CN's Accommodation Policy in the case of the Complainant, but she did not. Interestingly, Ms. Storms testified that she had initiated an accommodation in the case of another employee who had also been recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver. That employee had a terminally ill parent and she gave him a leave of absence. She was also aware from a review of the CMC spreadsheets that other employees had been excused from reporting to Vancouver due to disability and for various other unexplained personal reasons.\n[195] In an email dated June 23rd, 2005, Ms. Storms summarized her telephone discussions with the Complainant and with Ms. Whyte. She mentioned that the Complainant had child care issues and that Ms. Whyte had a son who was ill and that she had custody issues. She also mentions in the email that both had written to Mr. Torchia. However, she also wrote that if the Complainant and the two other women decided not to protect the shortage in Vancouver, their employment files would be closed and their seniority forfeited. This email was sent to Ms. Gallegos, and copied to Mr. Nashman, Mr. Torchia, Kenneth Sherman and Brian Kalin (Mr. Pizziol's supervisor). None of these managers thought that it might be appropriate, in the face of the Complainant's situation, to initiate the Accommodation Policy.\n[196] The evidence also indicates that CN did not apply its own accommodations guidelines and policies in the Complainant's case. CN has a very comprehensive accommodation policy. This policy recognizes all the prohibited grounds enumerated in the CHRA, including family status, and the policy clearly indicates that, wherever possible, employment policies and practices are to be adjusted so that no individual is denied employment opportunities... It also specifies that accommodation means making every possible effort to meet the reasonable needs of employees.\n[197] CN Accommodation Guidelines explains that the objective of the policy is to ensure that working conditions are not a barrier to employment. It also makes clear that CN has to show flexibility in eliminating any barriers and that it should make every effort to ensure that no one is put at a disadvantage because of a special need or requirement.\n[198] The policy also defines the process to be followed in case of a request for accommodation where one of the enumerated grounds and it provides a checklist to be followed by managers and supervisors in case of such a request. The Policy explains:\nThe first thing to do when an employee reports a problem or special need is to meet with the individual. Allow the employee to present the problem or need, ask questions to fully understand the request, and together discuss possible solutions.\nIf no solutions can be identified in this manner, do not reject the request outright. Ask for advice, seek other solutions to the problem, and evaluate the impact of any potential accommodation with the appropriate functions, including the People department, among other. The employee has the responsibility to participate actively in the process, and to facilitate reasonable accommodation. Unions also have a recognized and important role and responsibility in the accommodation of the needs of employees.\nIt is extremely important to keep records of the meeting held, the various solutions proposed, and the arguments used to accept or reject each option. This information is indispensable in the event of a complaint.\nPromptly inform the person in question of the decision taken, explaining the reasons for the decision. In the event that a request for accommodation is denied, employees may have a right to grieve under the appropriate grievance procedure or make a complaint under the CHRA.\n[199] Ms. Ziemer testified that the Policy is aimed at doing an individualized assessment of the employee's situation, since every situation is different. In the case of the Complainant it is clear that no individualized assessment was done.\n[200] The person responsible for the accommodation policy at CN's Edmonton office is, as indicated earlier, Mary-Jane Morrison, a Human Resources Officer. It is with her that people who have questions about the policy or its procedure consult. Ms. Morrison was not a witness at the hearing. Instead, CN called as a witness Stephanie Ziemer, the Human Resources Officer in Vancouver. Ms. Ziemer testified as to her understanding of what family status covered as a ground of discrimination. She explained that from her perspective as a human resources manager, family status means that an employer cannot discriminate against somebody who has a family, either a parent who has children or any individual that is a member of a family. She further added certainly family status, from my understanding [...] would not incorporate any kind of or individualized parental obligations. These are very individualized and personal preferences that people have, and certainly I never saw it as coming under our policy to being involved in these types of individualized parental preferences.\n[201] On cross-examination, Ms. Ziemer was asked to explain what she meant by individualized parental preferences. She stated: Whether or not you want to be at home to put, you know, your child to bed. Whether or not you want to attend every sporting event with your child. I mean, those are all things that we'd like to do as parents, but they would not be sufficient to initiate the accommodation process. She did add though that taking care of an ill child, having issues regarding a custody order or being a single parent would be a different thing and that it might open the door to discussions. She agreed that it was CN's expectation that single parents, if they want to be railroaders, have to manage their affairs so that they can perform their working obligations. But, she also added that if something unusual came along, for example, being asked to go cover a shortage, that might also open the door to discussions.\n[202] Once the door is opened, the process provides that there should be a meeting between the employee and is supervisor, so that the latter can get a feeling of what is the problem. Ms. Ziemer acknowledged that the simple exchange of letters at this stage would not be as efficient. At that meeting the supervisor should ask for more information about the reasons for the request and discuss possible solutions.\n[203] Ms. Ziemer testified that she had no hands on implication or any personal knowledge of the Complainant's situation. She also added that Human Resources is not always involved in these cases. Whenever possible, they are resolved at the local level. She further stated that CN had trained its managers well enough that they have the abilities to make a good management decisions, protecting the operation and making, where necessary, small adaptations or small adjustments to the working conditions of the employee.\n[204] Ms. Ziemer gave various examples of situations where CN had accommodated employees on the basis of family status, starting with her own situation. She explained that her husband had been severely injured in a skiing accident. For a period of ten weeks, he could not move his arm or upper body. During this period, she explained that she was allowed not to travel and was given a flexible working schedule. She also testified to the accommodations given to an individual in Vancouver so he could be available for his son who was involved in illegal activities, including gang-related activities and to a Conductor whose daughter had a significant psychological breakdown. This employee was allowed to work closer to home for a rather lengthy period of time. She added that CN had also accommodated a market manager upon her return from parental leave because her child had a severe eating disorder. This employee was given additional time off upon completion of her parental leave.\n[205] On cross-examination by Counsel for the CHRC, Ms. Ziemer was reminded of two other examples that she had referred to in the Seeley hearing. One of these was an accommodation for an employee which allowed him to be absent from the working board every second weekend because he only had visitation rights for 48 hours every two weeks. The other was an accommodation granted to an employee who was involved in a lengthy custody battle in Court. This person was given additional time off for this reason.\n[206] She further testified that most of these cases had been dealt with at the local level. She further added that supervisors are trained to pick up on that type of request. But, she stated unfortunately we can't supervise what they're doing out there in the field in terms of putting the actual teachings to use. We would like to think that they are well conversant in our policies, well trained. But whether or not that Supervisor A at Location B would be able to pick up on the issue coming forward, I can't say definitively that that would happen.\n[207] According to Ms. Ziemer, although there are no mechanism to evaluate the application of the policy, CN's expectations is that the front line supervisors are doing the right thing in terms of the policy, are living up to the policy and are abiding by the intricacies of the policy. She added that when the policy is not followed, Human Resources usually hears about it through various correspondences, or from their counterparts on the labour relations side. As a general rule, CN is operating on the notion that its supervisors are following the policy in terms of what they have been taught and what CN's expectations are.\n[208] Ms. Ziemer also testified on cross-examination that the process described in the accommodation policy would start as soon as an employee came forward and reported a problem or special need, although she added that that would not necessarily always lead to a decision that accommodation is necessary. When asked by Complainant's counsel why this process had not been initiated in the Complainant's case, she answered that she did not know, because she had not been involved in this case. She also added that usually the employee goes to his or her immediate supervisor as the first step.\n[209] Mr. Torchia testified that he had not met with the Complainant, because this would ordinarily be done by the Complainant's supervisor. He added that he did not know for a fact whether her supervisor had met with her, but he would assume he did because he had a telephone conversation with him and he was aware of the situation.\n[210] On cross-examination, he testified that he had received training with regard to the duty to accommodate many years ago, in the early nineties. For her part, Ms. Storms testified that she did not recall receiving any training on CN's accommodation policy. She added that she knew about the policy and that if she had some concerns about it she would talk to somebody in Human Resources. Ms. Storms further added that she never really used the accommodation policy, because CMC does not get many requests for accommodation. She did acknowledge though that there were times where CMC had accommodated employees because of serious illnesses in the employee's family or because somebody needed time off for personal reasons.\n[211] She further testified that although she remembered having read the policy, she was not very familiar with it and did not have a detailed knowledge of it. She did not know if anybody else at CMC had had training on the policy. On cross-examination from counsel for the CHRC she answered that to her knowledge none of the dispatchers and\/or members of the Board Adjustment Group, who were primarily responsible for contacting the employees recalled to cover the shortage in Vancouver, had any training regarding CN's accommodation policy. Asked to explain how they would recognize an issue of accommodation if one came up, Ms. Storms answered that they knew that CN accommodates people and that sometimes they are aware of an employee's situation. The general rule would be for them to refer an employee with special request to his supervisor.\n[212] According to the Complainant's evidence, CN's accommodation policy was not followed in her case. She added that she never met with her supervisor, the trainmaster in Jasper, nor did she get any response to the letters she had sent to supervisors or managers of CN explaining her situation. There was also no evidence that she had met with anybody at Human Resources or that she had been referred to them. It is clear from the evidence that CN did not follow the procedure set out in its own policy and that it had decided that family status, at least in terms of parental obligations and responsibilities, was not a ground of discrimination for which accommodation was required. It is also clear that CN never did an individualized assessment of the Complainant's situation as it was required to do.\n[213] In her letter to Mr. Torchia, the Complainant suggested as a possible accommodation that she be granted a compassionate leave of absence for the duration of the Vancouver shortage. The evidence indicates, based on the return to Jasper of another employee who had been forced to Vancouver, that this would have been around March 2006. If the leave of absence had been granted, the Complainant would not have provided services to CN and she would not have earned any wages. CN did not submit any evidence to establish how the granting of a leave of absence would have caused it an undue hardship.\n[214] Even if I was to accept the evidence that CN had provided some form of accommodation by granting the plaintiff more time to report to Vancouver, CN's failure to meet the procedural obligations of the duty to accommodate would in itself still give rise to a violation of the Complainant's human rights. The Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged that both the decision-making process and the final decision have to be taken into consideration in analyzing a BFOR. In Meiorin, the Court states at para. 66: It may often be useful as a practical matter to consider separately, first, the procedure, if any, which was adopted to assess the issue of accommodation and, second, the substantive content of either a more accommodating standard which was offered or alternatively the employer's reasons for not offering any such standard. (See also Oak Bay Marina Ltd. v. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal) (No. 2), 2004 BCHRT 225, at paras. 84-86).\n[215] In Lane v. ADGA Group Consultant Inc., 2007 HRTO 34, at para. 150, (decision upheld by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, Divisional Court, at [2008] O.J. No. 3076, 91 O.R.(3d) 649) the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal held that:\n...[T]he failure to meet the procedural dimensions of the duty to accommodate is a form of discrimination. It denies the affected person the benefit of what the law requires: a recognition of the obligation not to discriminate and to act in such a way as to ensure that discrimination does not take place.\n[216] In Meiorin, the Supreme Court identified the following question as being relevant in analyzing the procedural part of the accommodation process followed by the employer:\nHas the employer investigated alternative approaches that do not have a discriminatory effect, such as individual testing against a more individually sensitive standard? If alternative standards were investigated and found to be capable of fulfilling the employer's purpose, why were they not implemented? Is it necessary to have all employees meet the single standard for the employer to accomplish its legitimate purpose or could standards reflective of group or individual differences and capabilities be established? Is there a way to do the job that is less discriminatory while still accomplishing the employer's legitimate purpose? Is the standard properly designed to ensure that the desired qualification is met without placing an undue burden on those to whom the standard applies? Have other parties who are obliged to assist in the search for possible accommodation fulfilled their roles?\n[217] To meet the procedural component of the duty to accommodate, CN had a duty to show that it had considered and reasonably rejected any accommodation that would have accommodated the needs of the Complainant.\n[218] The only evidence that this assessment of other form of accommodation might have occurred is the evidence that the Union had suggested canvassing the employees in Jasper to see if anybody would volunteer to cover the shortage instead of the Complainant, Kasha Whyte and Denise Seeley. But, since nobody came forward, the canvassing stopped. There is no evidence that CN did an individualized assessment of the Complainant's situation or investigated any alternative form of accommodation\n[219] I will now deal with CN's position to the effect that it would be undue hardship to grant the relief sought by the Complainant because she would then be granted super seniority based on the simple fact of her status as a parent.\n[220] According to Stephanie Ziemer, CN does not capture the information regarding how many of its employees are parents. She added that the only way to have this information would be to review each employee's file to see who they designate as dependants. Ms. Ziemer further added that from CN's employees group insurance benefit plan we can assume that approximately 69% of [CN's] workforce are parents. The methodology used by CN to produce this evidence was severally put to test at the hearing by the Complainant's counsel. But beside the methodological problems, the Tribunal concludes that this very partial evidence falls well short of the evidence that CN would need to produce to justify discrimination on a balance of probabilities using the tripartite Meiorin BFOR test.\n[221] If the Tribunal was to accept CN's argument that because a vast majority of its employees are parents, accommodating the Complainant would cause it undue hardship, that would mean that any workplace with a large number of persons falling into a group with one or the other of the personal characteristics set forth in section 3 of the CHRA would automatically be precluded from the application of the law. For example, it would mean that women working in a workplace where the vast majority of employees are women would be precluded from making a complaint of discrimination based upon gender. Accepting CN's argument would have the effect of making it impossible for an individual to make a complaint on the ground of family status - at least, family status matters that involve parental obligations and responsibilities - because most of the employees in the workforce are parents and could also potentially follow the same route.\n[222] CN did not produce any evidence that it was overwhelmed with requests for accommodation from people in the Complainant's situation. In Grismer, supra, at para. 41, the Supreme Court of Canada stated quite clearly that in the context of accommodation impressionistic evidence of increased expense will not generally suffice. In Lane, supra, at paragraph 117, the Ontario Divisional Court added:\nUndue hardship cannot be established by relying on impressionistic or anecdotal evidence, or after-the-fact justifications. Anticipated hardships caused by proposed accommodations should not be sustained if based only on speculative or unsubstantiated concern that certain adverse consequences might or could result if the claimant is accommodated.\n[223] Regardless of the particular basis for CN's claim that it will suffer undue hardship, it is well established that the undue hardship analysis must be applied in the context of the individual accommodation being requested. As the Supreme Court stated in Grismer, supra, at paragraph 19, accommodation must be incorporated into the standard itself to ensure that each person is assessed according to her or his own personal abilities, instead of being judged against presumed group characteristics which are frequently based on bias and historical prejudice. Accordingly, an employee's individual assessment is an essential step in the accommodation process unless it is in itself an undue hardship for the respondent (See Grismer, at paragraphs 22, 30, 32 and 38; Meiorin, at paragraph 65; Audet v. National Railway, 2006 CHRT 25, at paragraph 61 and Knight v. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de l'Outaouais, 2007 CHRT 15, at paragraph 72). Again, this individual assessment was not done in the case of the Complainant.\n[224] In the instant case, CN has failed to provide evidence that accommodating the Complainant would cause undue hardship in terms of costs. The only evidence regarding cost was with respect to the training of Conductors and there was no attempt to relate that evidence to the situation in the present case. We must remember that in order to be found to be undue, the cost of accommodation must be substantial. In Quesnel v. London Educational Health Centre (1995), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/474 (Ont. Bs. Inq.), the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal stated, at paragraph 59,: cost would amount to undue hardship only if it would alter the essential nature or substantially affect the viability of the enterprise responsible for the accommodation. This is recognized in CN own Accommodation policy which states: The costs incurred must be extremely high before the refusal to accommodate can be justified. The burden of justifying the refusal rests with the employer. The cost incurred must be quantifiable and related to the accommodation. Renovations or special equipment can be expensive but financial aid may sometimes be obtained from various organizations. No evidence of this nature was submitted at the hearing.\ne) Conclusion [225] For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence has established that CN has breached sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA. CN's practice of requiring the Complainant to protect the shortage in Vancouver has had an adverse effect on her because of her family status. The evidence demonstrates that CN acted contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the CHRA by pursuing a policy and practice that deprived the Complainant of employment opportunities based upon her family status.\n[226] The evidence also establishes that the Complainant was put at a disadvantage because of her special needs and requirements. CN's managers never met with her. They never allowed her the opportunity to present and explain her needs, nor did they ask any questions to fully understand her request. They never sought any advice from their own Human Resources Department. If they had, they would certainly have been told to initiate the policy considering Ms. Ziemer's evidence that the policy is initiated as soon as a employee comes forward and reports a problem or a special need and her evidence that taking care of an ill child, having issues regarding a custody order or being a single parent would at least open the door to discussions.\nD. REMEDIES [227] The remedies sought by the Complainant are compensation for lost wages and benefits, compensation for pain and suffering, special compensation, legal cost and interest and an order that she be reinstated in her employment with CN with full seniority, benefits and all other opportunities or privileges that were denied to her. The CHRC also seeks an order ensuring that CN cease all discriminatory practices and behaviour and that it review its accommodation policy.\n(i) An Order that CN Review its Accommodation Policy [228] The CHRC requests an order, pursuant to section 53(2)(a) of the CHRA, that CN take measures, in consultation with the CHRC, to redress its failure to properly accommodate its employees on the basis of family status, including issues of parental obligations and responsibilities. It further requests an order that appropriate human rights training for CN's managerial, human resources and crew management personal be put in place and that regular information sessions on accommodation policies be offered in an effort to eliminate discriminatory attitudes and assumptions related to family status as a ground of discrimination.\n[229] Although the Tribunal acknowledges that CN has a good policy on accommodation, it is clear that it has not been applied or implemented properly in the case of family status as a ground of discrimination. Some evidence has also indicated that the policy has not been revised since the Tribunal's decision in Audet v. Canadian National Railway, [2006] CHRT 25 and Hoyt, supra. At the most, according to Cathy Smolynek, CN's Senior Director of Occupational Health Services, some process changes were made in the disability area of the Policy.\n[230] I have referred in my decision to the Accommodation Guidelines and have determined that the managers and supervisors have failed to follow this policy in the Complainant's case. Having reviewed the evidence, I conclude that CHRC's request is justified.\n[231] I therefore order CN to work with the Commission to ensure that the discriminatory practice and behaviour does not continue and to make sure:\nthat the appropriate policies, practices and procedures are in place, and that CN, in consultation with the CHRC, retain appropriate persons to conduct workplace training for manager, human resource staff, CMC employees and any other employees deemed necessary on issues of discrimination and human rights and particularly on accommodation on the ground of family status.\n(ii) Reinstatement [232] The Complainant seeks an order, pursuant to s. 53(2)(b) of the CHRA, directing CN to return her to her employment as a Conductor with CN. Section 53(2)(b) of the CHRA states that where the Tribunal finds the complaint is substantiated, it may order a respondent to make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that were denied the victim as a result of the practice.\n[233] In order to provide this remedy in the present case, the Complainant must therefore be returned to her job without lost of seniority. The Tribunal therefore orders CN to set up the Complainant as a Conductor at the Jasper terminal, after she has, if necessary, updated her rules and medical certificates.\n[234] There are three possible starting dates that the Tribunal could reasonably fix for the Complainant reinstatement. The first date suggested is July 2nd, 2005, which could be seen as the effective date for implementation of the Complainant's request to be accommodated by being set up in a full time position in Jasper. The Tribunal does not accept this as an appropriate date as there was no evidence that the Complainant could have been set up in a full time position in Jasper at that time or if this would have been the appropriate accommodation. There was also no evidence of any employees being set up in Jasper at that time.\n[235] The second date is March 1st, 2006. According to the evidence, this is the date that another laid off employee from Jasper, who had been recall and had reported to Vancouver, was set up in Jasper. Since only four employees from Jasper, the Complainant, Denise Seeley, Kasha Whyte and this other employee, had been recalled and told to report to Vancouver it might be reasonable to expect that the they would also have been set up in Jasper around March 2006. Ms. Storms testified that because the Complainant seniority is very close to [that of the employee who was set up] it is safe to say that they would have been recalled to Jasper at that time as well.\n[236] Finally, evidence was produced that in March 2007, CN hired new Conductors in Jasper and that many of these new Conductors have since been set up. It is reasonable to conclude therefore that the Complainant had, at that time, seniority over these new Conductors and that she would have been set up in Jasper ahead of them.\n[237] With the admission of Ms. Storms, it is safe to conclude that the Complainant would most likely have been set up in March 2006, had she not been terminated and this date is therefore the one retained for her reinstatement.\n[238] In regards to her seniority, since seniority continues to accumulate even when an employee is on lay off, it will in this case continue to accumulate as if there had never been a breach in her relationship with CN on July 2nd, 2005.\n(iii) Compensation for lost wages [239] The complainant seek compensation for all wages and benefits lost pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA. Considering my conclusion as to the date of reinstatement, I order that the Complainant be compensated for all lost of wages and benefits from March 1st, 2006 to today. The parties are ordered to calculate the amount of wages owing using the formula provided for in the Collective Agreement. In regards to extra payments that a road Conductor could receive, since it would be difficult for the Tribunal to set an amount, it is ordered that the parties establish this amount by looking at the extras that were paid for the period to a Conductor with similar seniority working in the terminal, assuming that that Conductor had no unusual absences. The parties could, for example, take into consideration the extra payments that were paid to the employee who was set up in Jasper in March 2006.\n[240] In 2006, the Complainant's income was $18,233.96. During that period the Complainant was holding two jobs, that of waitress and the one at the building centre. In 2007, she got a promotion to Assistant Manager at the building centre and her earnings were then of $33,172.58. In 2008, she held the same position with earnings of $37,365.44. In July 2009, she got another promotion to the position of Manager. Since July, she is making $17.00 an hour and working forty hours a week. For the first months of 2009, she was earning $15.50. She receives no other benefits at this job.\n[241] For mitigation purposes, these amounts should therefore be deducted from the amount of her lost wages.\n[242] As to the claim for lost wages from July 2nd, 2005 to March 1st, 2006, there was no evidence that the Complainant would have been working during that period. Even if she would have been allowed to remain on the emergency board, there was no evidence submitted that would allow the Tribunal to set this amount so the Tribunal makes no order for that period.\n(iv) Pain and suffering [243] Section 53(2) of the CHRA provides for compensation for pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice, up to a maximum of $20,000.\n[244] The Complainant testified that between the time when she was informed that she was being forced and the date she was fired, the situation wasn't very difficult for her because she sincerely believe that everything would be resolved. But after she was fired, things were difficult for her and her children because she did not know what was going to happen. She added that the decision to fire her was very difficult for her. She felt that she was very close to being set up and that now that opportunity had vanished. She described the decision to fire her as a mind blowing situation and huge blow financially and family wise. She added that she was basically in denial and that she did not think that it was possible. She felt rejected like in when you're losing a spouse, a partner.\n[245] Although no medical evidence was produced to, the Tribunal concludes that CN's conduct and nonchalant attitude towards her situations was disturbing for the Complainant. Taking this into consideration, the Tribunal orders CN to pay to the Complainant $15,000 in compensation for her pain and suffering.\n(v) Willful or Reckless Conduct [246] Section 53(3) of the CHRA provides for additional compensation where the Respondent has engaged in the discriminatory practice willfully or recklessly up to a maximum of $20,000.\n[247] CN had an accommodation policy, which set out the procedures to be followed with respect to any employees who reported any problem or a special need. This policy clearly identified family status as one of the ground for discrimination. Yet, CN and the senior managers involved in this case decided that they needed be concerned with family status and ignored their responsibilities under the policy. They didn't make any efforts to try to understand the Complainant's situations. They ignored her letters and decided to treat her case as just a child care issue. They felt that they knew, without ever speaking to the Complainant, what was better for her and what she needed. This course of action was, in my view, reckless.\n[248] In the circumstances, I order CN to pay to the Complainant the sum of $20,000, in additional compensation under section 53(3) of the Act.\n(vi) Compensation for expenses [249] In her closing arguments, counsel for the Complainant sought an award for legal cost. The question whether the Tribunal had the authority to award costs and whether that authority could be found in paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, which authorizes the Tribunal to compensate a complainant for any expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice, was dealt with by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Attorney General) v. Mowat, 2009 FCA 309, a decision rendered in the closing days of the hearing.\n[250] After an analysis of Human Rights Code in various provinces that allowed an award for cost and after analyzing the purported intent of Parliament, the Federal Court of Appeal concluded at paragraph 95:\nThe quest is to determine whether Parliament intended to endow the Tribunal with the authority to award costs to a successful complainant. For the reasons given, I conclude that Parliament did not intend to grant, and did not grant, to the Tribunal the power to award costs. To conclude that the Tribunal may award legal costs under the guise of expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice would be to introduce indirectly into the Act a power which Parliament did not intend it to have.\n[251] Taking into consideration the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, the Tribunal cannot accede to the Complainant's request that CN be ordered to pay her legal cost.\n[252] The Complainant and Kasha Whyte have submitted out of pocket expenses which amount to $336.68, each being accountable for half this amount. Under the provision of paragraph 53(2)(c) of the Act, CN is ordered to reimburse half this amount to the Complainant.\n(vii) Interest [253] In regards to interest, interest is payable in respect of all the awards in this decision (s. 53(4) of the CHRA). The interest shall be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank Rate (Monthly series) set by the Bank of Canada. With respect to the compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53 (2)(e) of the CHRA) and the special compensation (s. 53(3)), the interest shall run from the date of the complaint and for the lost of earning if will run from the date of reinstatement.\nSigned by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario September 29, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1356\/8608\nSTYLE OF CAUSE: Cindy Richards v.

Lustig\n[1] This is a Ruling on the request of the Complainant that the Tribunal withhold any determination on costs until the Supreme Court of Canada renders its Decision in Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Attorney General of Canada, et al. (Case no. 33507)\n[2] The Complaint in this matter was filed by the Complainant on January 11, 2007. It alleged that the Respondent had discriminated against him by terminating his employment as a consequence of a physical disability, contrary to s. 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[3] An inquiry into this Complaint was requested by the Canadian Human Rights Commission ( the Commission) as being warranted pursuant to s. 44 (3) (a) of the CHRA by letter dated August 26, 2008.\n[4] The Complainant's Statement of Particulars dated April 1, 2009 invoked various remedial subsections of s. 53 of the CHRA seeking, among other things, costs.\n[5] A hearing was held by me in this matter on June 15th to June 19th, 2009 and on June 22nd, 2009. In her summation at the hearing, Ms. Raymond, counsel for the Complainant did not make any submissions with respect to the issue of legal costs.\n[6] On October 26th, 2009 the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (AG) v. Mowat, 2009 FCA 309 held that ...the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has no authority to make an award of costs under the provisions of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[7] My Decision in the matter was rendered on January 27, 2010. In my Decision I determined that the Complaint had been substantiated as the Respondent had engaged in a discriminatory practice as alleged.\n[8] In my Decision I ordered the Respondent to compensate the Complainant for pain and suffering in connection with the discriminatory practice pursuant to s. 53 (2) (e) of the CHRA and I ordered the Respondent to compensate the Complainant for its willful conduct in connection with the discriminatory practice pursuant to s. 53 (3) of the CHRA. I did not reserve on any matter.\n[9] No application for a judicial review was made with respect to my Decision.\n[10] On March 1, 2010 the current request was made by Ms. Raymond, counsel for the Complainant by a letter to the Tribunal. In its response to the letter, the Director, Registry Operations for the Tribunal, wrote to Ms. Raymond on March 5, 2010 drawing her attention to the October 26, 2009 Decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Mowat, regarding the issue of costs. The Tribunal, in its letter, invited the Complainant to file written submissions, including jurisprudence, in support of his request. The Respondent's counsel was also copied with the letter and given an opportunity to respond with written submissions and the Complainant was given an opportunity to reply.\n[11] On April 22, 2010 the Supreme Court of Canada granted leave to appeal the Decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Mowat.\n[12] The Complainant's submissions were filed with the Tribunal on May 31, 2010. The Respondent's submissions were filed with the Tribunal on July 19, 2010. The Complainant's reply to the Respondent's submissions were filed with the Tribunal by letter dated August 6, 2010.\n[13] The Complainant's submissions, in summary, are as follows:\nThere is authority for the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to award legal costs to a successful complainant pursuant to subsection 53 (2) (c) of the CHRA which states as follows: 53 (2) If, at the conclusion of its inquiry, a Tribunal finds that the complaint to which the inquiry relates is substantiated, it may, subject to subsection (4) and section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in that order any of the following terms that it considers appropriate:\n(c) that the person compensate the victim, as the Tribunal may consider proper, for any or all of the wages that the victim was deprived of and for any expenses incurred by the victim as a result of the discriminatory practice.\nOn multiple occasions, throughout the majority of Canadian jurisdictions, Tribunals and Courts have included legal costs within the meaning of any expenses.\nThe Decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Mowat is a narrow interpretation of this section of the CHRA and creates an obstacle which could potentially jeopardize access to justice for many complainants. This narrow interpretation of subsection 53 (2) (c) by the Federal Court of Appeal in Mowat does not reflect the purpose of the CHRA. By excluding legal costs from any expenses, the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of Canadian society are having their inherent right to access to justice further infringed. Due to the significance of the outcome of the Supreme Court of Canada's Decision granting leave to appeal Mowat, the Complainant requests that the Tribunal reserve its Judgment on costs until the matter is dealt with by the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[14] The Respondent's submissions, in summary, are as follows:\nThe Tribunal is bound to follow Mowat as an incident of stare decisis and as a matter of its own jurisdiction. The Tribunal is functus officio. The Decision of the Tribunal, even were there now jurisdiction to order costs, which there is not, does not necessarily support a claim for costs on its merits since success was divided in the case, as the Tribunal determined not to make Orders for a number of the remedies sought by the Complainant. The request in these circumstances is to be tested as though it were a motion for a stay of proceedings. In this case there is no evidence that any of the criteria for a stay order is met, including no evidence of irreparable harm or a balance of convenience (inconvenience) favouring the Complainant, nor is there a foundation for such a conclusion otherwise available.\n[15] The Complainant's submissions in reply, in summary, are as follows:\nThis case involves a special circumstance due to the Decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that renders stare decisis inoperative in this case. Despite the principle of functus officio, since the Complainant raised the issue of costs in his Statement of Particulars and the issue was not addressed in the Decision, the Tribunal has the power to dispose of this issue since there is authority in subsection 53 (2) (c) of the CHRA to do so. An award of costs is justified on its merits by virtue of the result in the Decision. The Complainant has not requested a stay of proceedings, rather the Complainant has requested that, for practical reasons, the Decision be withheld until the Supreme Court of Canada has rendered its Judgment in Mowat.\n[16] When I rendered my Decision in this matter I considered the remedies requested by the Complainant. I did not reserve on any issue. I determined that I was bound to follow the Decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Mowat on the basis of the fundamental legal principle of stare decisis - the translation of which means to stay with what has been decided. In this regard, I accept the submissions of the Respondent, including the following:\nThe Inquiry is bound by the principles that it is bound to correctly interpret and apply the law pertaining to its jurisdiction.\nA mechanism to achieve that correctness and associated stability and finality is stare decisis:\nThe Trial Judge correctly found himself to be bound by the jurisprudence as am I. Stare decisis is the normal rule and is itself one of the basic tenets of our legal system (thus an element of fundamental justice) allowing Canadians some certainty and predictability in the law as well as some efficiency in the administration of their system of justice.\nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)\nv. Fast, 2001 FCA 373, para 2.\nIn not making an award of costs in this case, the Tribunal correctly exercised its jurisdiction in compliance with that authority and in accordance with the principle of stare decisis.\n[17] Having made my Decision in this matter without reservation, and being bound, as previously noted, by the law as it then was (and still is) respecting legal costs, I am now functus officio. Again, in this regard, I accept the submissions of the Respondent, including the following:\nThe Decision discharged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in those matters effectively put before it.\nHaving spent its jurisdiction, in the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal has discharged its legal responsibilities in the dispute. It is functus officio.\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has explained the concept as follows:\nFunctus Officio\nThe general rule that a final decision of a court cannot be reopened derives from the decision of the English Court of Appeal in In re St. Nazaire Co. (1879), 12 Ch. D. 88. The basis for it was that the power to rehear was transferred by the Judicature Acts to the appellate division. The rule applied only after the formal judgment had been drawn up, issued and entered, and was subject to two exceptions:\n1. where there had been a slip in drawing it up, and,\n2. where there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court. See Paper Machinery Ltd. V. J.O. Ross Engineering Corp., 1934 CanLII 1 (S.C.C.), [1934] S.C.R. 186.\nI do not understand Martland J. to go so far as to hold that functus officio has no application to administrative tribunals. Apart from the English practice which is based on a reluctance to amend or reopen formal judgments, there is a sound policy reason for recognizing the finality of proceedings before administrative tribunals. As a general rule, once such a tribunal has reached a final decision in respect to the matter that is before it in accordance with its enabling statute, that decision cannot be revisited because there has been a change of circumstances. It can only do so if authorized by statute or if there has been a slip or error within the exceptions enunciated in Paper Machinery Ltd. V. J.O. Ross Engineering Corp., supra.\nTo this extent, the principle of functus officio applies. It is based, however, on the policy ground which favours finality of proceedings rather than the rule which was developed with respect to formal judgments of a court whose decision was subject to a full appeal. For this reason I am of the opinion that is application must be more flexible and less formalistic in respect to the decisions of administrative tribunals which are subject to appeal only on a point of law. Justice may require the reopening of administrative proceedings in order to provide relief which would otherwise be available on appeal.\nAccordingly, the principle should not be strictly applied where there are indications in the enabling statute that a decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the function committed to it by enabling legislation. This was the situation in Grillas, supra.\nFurthermore, if the tribunal has failed to dispose of an issue which is fairly raised by the proceedings and of which the tribunal is empowered by its enabling statute to dispose, it ought to be allowed to complete its statutory task. If, however, the administrative entity is empowered to dispose of a matter by one or more specified remedies or by alternative remedies, the fact that one is selected does not entitle it to reopen proceedings to make another or further selection. Nor will reserving the right to do so preserve the continuing jurisdiction of the tribunal unless a power to make provisional or interim orders has been conferred on it by statute. See Huneault v. Central Mortgage and Housing Corp. (1981), 41 N.R. 214 (F.C.A.)\nChandler v. Alberta Association of Architects [1989]\nS.C.J. No. 102\nIn this case ... there is no foundation for the proposition that there is some error or oversight or other compelling policy objective warranting the conclusion that the inquiry continues to have jurisdiction which it si capable of exercising.\n[18] In the result, the request of the Complainant is denied.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Introduction:\nII. Analysis:\nIII. Conclusion:\nI. Introduction: [1] The Panel is seized of a preliminary issue raised by the Respondent, Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., (the Respondent) in respect of a complaint filed January 10, 2008, with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) by Ms. Heather Lynn Grant (the Complainant). The Respondent has filed a motion to add the Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. (TEAM or the Union) as a Respondent to the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the complaint.\n[2] The grounds for the motion are section 48.9(2) (b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) and section 8(3) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure.\n[3] In her complaint, the Complainant alleges that the Respondent discriminated against her by adverse differential treatment, refusal to accommodate her disability and by terminating her employment because of the said disability in violation of section 7 of the Act.\n[4] The Respondent\u2019s position is as follows:\nThe Complainant was identified for lay-off in compliance with the terms of the Collective Agreement entered into between the Union and the Respondent; The Respondent maintains that the addition of the Union as a Respondent to the inquiry is necessary for the Tribunal to properly determine this matter and if necessary grant an effective remedy; The Respondent also argues that if the Tribunal finds that there is discrimination, the Union and the Respondent are jointly liable for an act of discrimination arising out of the operation of the Collective Agreement and jointly responsible for remedying same.\n[5] On June 28, 2010, Ms. Shirish P. Chotalia, Q.C., the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, determined that this motion would be dealt with through written arguments. The undersigned was designated to decide the present motion.\nII. Analysis: [6] The Act does not provide any procedure as such for the forced addition of parties and interested persons in a proceeding before the Tribunal. At most, paragraph (b) of subsection 48.9(2) of the Act states as follows:\nThe Chairperson may make rules of procedure governing the practice and procedure before the Tribunal, including, but not limited to, rules governing (\u2026)\n(b) the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings; (...)\n[7] Prior to 2004, the Chairperson had not made any rules dealing with the addition of parties, with or without their consent, and it was unclear if the Tribunal had the jurisdiction to do so.\n[8] I find the following reasons stated in rulings issued in the Desormeaux v. OC Transpo (T701\/0602) and Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone section locale 5044 du SCFP v. Telus communications (Qu\u00e9bec) inc., 2003 CHRT 31 (Telus) cases to be instructive:\n[25] In an oral decision rendered on October 2, 2002, in Desormeaux v. OC Transpo (T701\/0602), the Chair of the Tribunal, who was seized of an application to add a union as a respondent, ruled that under section 50 of the Act, the Tribunal has the power to add individuals or groups as interested persons in the context of a hearing (our underlining). She pointed out, however, that in the case in point, this was not the issue put to her, the issue to be decided being, rather, whether a third party (a party not involved in the complaint) could be added as a respondent, with the effects this could have with regard to its liability.\n[9] On this point, the Chair of the Tribunal concluded, relying on paragraph (b) of subsection 48.9(2) of the A c t, that the legislator's intent was to vest in the Tribunal the power to add parties as well as interested persons to a proceeding before the Tribunal. Thus the jurisdictional question was answered in the affirmative. What remained to be determined was whether it was appropriate to add a respondent in those particular circumstances.\n[10] In a subsequent oral decision rendered on October 3, 2002, in the same case, the Chair of the Tribunal ruled that the circumstances did not warrant the addition of the union as a respondent. She ruled that, while it had previously been found that the Act vests in the Tribunal the power to add parties to a proceeding when the Tribunal deems it appropriate, the legislative context surrounding this discretionary power argues for a measure of restraint or caution (the term used by the Chair).\n[11] In this regard, the Chair of the Tribunal pointed out, most aptly in my view that the Act provides, in dealing with complaints of discrimination, a carefully developed process of investigation and inquiry in which both the Commission and the Tribunal have clearly defined roles.\n[12] In her decision, the Chair of the Tribunal mentioned the fact that the addition of parties during a proceeding before the Tribunal deprives the new Respondent of the benefit of certain means of defence it can normally present at the stage of the screening of a complaint by the Commission, notably the possibility of having the complaint dismissed without the need for the Tribunal to institute an inquiry, for example because the complaint was filed after the period of one year stipulated in the Act.\n[13] In a decision rendered by the Tribunal on November 27, 2002, in Bozek v. MCL Ryder Transport Inc. and McGill (T716\/2102 and T717\/2202), the Panel ordered, following an application in this regard by the Commission and the Complainant, that the initial complaint be amended to substitute the name of the company born of the merger of the initial Respondent with a number of other corporations in place of the name of the initial Respondent.\n[14] The following year, in the ruling in Telus the Tribunal once again held that it had the power to add respondents. It further held that, in the absence of formal rules dealing with the matter, the forced addition of a new respondent would be appropriate:\n\u2026if it is established that the presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint of which the Tribunal is seized and that it was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint.\n[15] In 2004, the Tribunal Chairperson made a rule providing for the addition of parties (Rule 8(3)), however this rule\u2014like the other Tribunal rules\u2014has not been published in the Canada Gazette as provided for in s. 48.9(3), so it is arguably not a formal rule as that term was used in the Telus ruling. Moreover, rule 8(3) does not stipulate any substantive pre-conditions for the issuance of an order joining a party.\n[16] In a recent decision, Canada (A.G.) v. Brown et al., 2008 FC 734, Justice Simon No\u00ebl, for the Federal Court, reaffirmed the principles set out by the Tribunal in Telus.\n[17] Even after the above Federal Court decision in Brown, the situation as remained the same, no formal rules have been made establishing the conditions on which the Tribunal may add a new respondent.\n[18] I share the concern raised by the Tribunal member in Telus that for all intents and purposes, the addition of a new Respondent at the stage of the Tribunal's inquiry into the complaint with no formal complaint having been brought against it deprives this new Respondent of the opportunity to present certain grounds of defence before the Commission pursuant to sections 41 and 44 of the Act.\n[19] The Respondent in the current matter argued that the Panel should apply the Renaud decision to the present motion (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970).\n[20] To that argument, I would respond with the reasoning of the Tribunal in Telus, with which I agree, and which I believe is equally applicable to the matter before me:\n[18] It should be pointed out that the facts in the Renaud case differ appreciably from those in the present case. In Renaud, the plaintiff had filed a complaint against both the employer and his union, which is not the case here. At the hearing of the complaint, the assigned member amended the complaint of which he was seized to include a claim against the union under another section of the Act as well as that brought under the initial section, in order to bring the initial complaint into conformity with the nature of the proceedings. The assigned member justified his decision by the fact that no prejudice would be suffered by the union as a result of the amendment as the union had been represented throughout the proceedings and had fully taken part in the initial complaint, which is not the case here. The Supreme Court confirmed the validity of the decision of the designated member to hear the complaint.\n[21] As for the Respondent\u2019s arguments based upon jurisprudential principles emanating from the provincial Courts, I would respectfully note that the Tribunal is not bound by said principles, which were developed in a different statutory context, and that the Tribunal cannot choose to follow them where there is binding jurisprudence on the issue from the Tribunal\u2019s own supervisory courts (i.e. the Federal Court\u2019s judgment in Brown).\n[22] In Telus, the Tribunal member, Pierre Deschamps, dismissed the motion for the following reasons:\n[36] In the case in point, the respondent has not satisfied me that the forced impleading of the Union is necessary in order to dispose of the complaint as worded. Moreover, I believe that the impleading of the Union at this stage would be prejudicial to it from a standpoint of procedural fairness.\n[37] This being said, it will be permissible for the respondent to assert during the hearing before the Tribunal that the evidence submitted to the Tribunal does not warrant the allowing of the complaint, and that it cannot be held liable or solely liable for the discrimination alleged in the complaint.\n[23] I concur with the Tribunal member\u2019s reasons which are applicable to this case. I take note of the fact that the Complainant is opposing the addition of the Union as a Respondent. I also note that the motion was brought before the Tribunal quite some time after the complaint had been referred to the Tribunal by the Commission.\n[24] Moreover, the Respondent will have the opportunity summon and examine a witness from the union at the hearing.\n[25] Finally the Respondent may make submissions to the Tribunal in its final arguments to the effect that, if the complaint is substantiated, the amount to provide to the Complainant on behalf of the Respondent, should be reduced according to any joint liability established and taken into account by the Tribunal.\nIII. Conclusion: [26] The motion is dismissed and the inquiry of the complaint will proceed as planned.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon Tribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario October 14, 2010\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1452\/7809\nStyle of Cause: Heather Lynn Grant v.

Introduction [1] On August 28, 2009, this Tribunal rendered its second decision finding that the respondents Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (ACPA) had engaged in a discriminatory practice against the complainants George Vilven (Vilven) and Robert Neil Kelly (Kelly) contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act. The Tribunal held a subsequent hearing to determine the complainants\u2019 remedy under s. 53 of the CHRA.\n[2] The complainants ask for an order that:\nAir Canada and ACPA cease applying the mandatory retirement provisions in the Air Canada pilots pension plan and in the collective agreement with respect to all pilots employed by Air Canada; they be reinstated as pilots with Air Canada and return to flying a regular assignment in accordance with their seniority as determined by the Tribunal; they receive compensation for lost wages from the date of their retirement to the date of their reinstatement; that upon reinstatement they continue to accrue pension and other benefits on the same terms and conditions as before their retirement; each of them be awarded $20,000 as compensation for pain and suffering and $20,000 as compensation for the wilful and reckless conduct of the respondents; out of pocket expenses; interest on the compensation.\nII. Cease and Desist Order [3] The complainants ask for an order that the respondents cease applying s.5.1 of the Air Canada Pilots Pension Plan and the corresponding provisions in the collective agreement, thereby eliminating mandatory retirement for all Air Canada pilots.\n[4] Section 5.1 provides that a member of the pension plan shall retire from the company no later than his normal retirement date. Normal retirement date is defined in s. 1.2(ii) as the first of the month immediately following the month the member attains the age of 60. The respondents agree to an order to cease applying s.5.1 of the pension plan but only with respect to these two complainants.\n[5] In its second decision, this Tribunal, upon concluding that s. 15 (1)(c) contravened the Charter, refused to apply this provision to the facts of this case. This conclusion followed the well-established principle set out in a number of Supreme Court of Canada decisions starting with Cuddy Chicks v. Ontario, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 517, where the Court referring to the Ontario Labour Relations Board, said that a formal declaration of invalidity is not available to the Board, nor can it expect any curial deference with respect to its constitutional decisions.\n[6] In the more recent SCC decision in Nova Scotia (WCB) v. Martin, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504, the Court reiterated the principle that constitutional remedies available to administrative tribunals are limited and do not include general declarations of invalidity. Further, a determination by a tribunal that a provision of its enabling statute is invalid under the Charter is not binding on a future tribunal or other decision maker.\n[7] The complainants agree with this statement of the law as does the Commission. However, they are asking that this Tribunal only exercise its remedial powers under s. 53(2)(a) of the CHRA. In particular, that the Tribunal order that the respondents cease the discriminatory practice of mandatory retirement and take measures in consultation with the Commission to prevent the same or similar practices from occurring in the future. Otherwise, to apply this remedial provision only to the complainants would not have the effect of preventing the discriminatory practice in the future.\n[8] In support of its position, the Commission relies on the SCC decision in CN v. Canada (CHRC), [1987]1 S.C.R. 1114 (Action Travail des Femmes). In this case, the ATF, a public interest pressure organization, filed a human rights complaint alleging that CN discriminated in its hiring and promotion practices by denying employment opportunities to women in certain unskilled blue-collar jobs.\n[9] The Tribunal substantiated the complaint and ordered, in effect, an employment equity program to address the systemic discrimination. CN appealed arguing that the Tribunal lacked the power to make this kind of remedial order under s.41(2)((a) of the CHRA (now 53(2)(a)).\n[10] The SCC disagreed pointing out that this provision was designed to deal with the problem of systemic discrimination and the employment equity program was designed to break the continuing cycle of discrimination. More to the point, the Court noted that the goal was not to compensate past victims or provide new opportunities for specific individuals who have been unfairly refused specific jobs or promotions in the past.\nA. Conclusion on Cease and Desist Order [11] In my opinion, the Commission cannot rely on the ATF decision. The present case does involve a systemic complaint. ATF involved a complaint by a public interest group on behalf of a large number of alleged victims of a discriminatory practice. This is a case of two separate individual complainants with the same complaint. It is not a group complaint. What the complainants are asking is to have their remedy extend beyond their individual complaints.\n[12] Further, and as this Tribunal pointed out in its previous decision, its finding that s. 15(1)(c) offends the Charter is not a legal precedent and is applicable only to the facts of this case. In these circumstances, s. 15(1)(c) remains operative and may be relied upon by other respondents as a defence to any other outstanding or future complaints regarding the mandatory policy in question. To grant the order requested would be to deprive them of the defence afforded by this section.\n[13] Finally, if this Tribunal made this order, using its remedial jurisdiction under s. 53(2)(a), it would be expanding its powers to that of a s. 96 court. In my opinion, this remedial power must read with the limitations imposed by the Supreme Court in Martin.\n[14] The more appropriate way of applying both Martin and s. 53(2)(a) in terms of remedy is for this Tribunal to rescind the termination of the complainants by an order to the respondents to cease applying s.5(1) of the pension plan vis a vis the complainants and redress the discriminatory practice by ordering their reinstatement.\nIII. Reinstatement [15] Air Canada\u2019s stated position is that the complainants will be reinstated to employment on condition that the normal eligibility requirements are met. These are that they must have a valid pilot licence, a valid medical certificate showing that they are fit to fly a commercial aircraft under the applicable Transport Canada medical standards, and either a current instrument flight rating or the ability to renew their rating. Kelly meets these requirements. At the time of the hearing, Vilven did not have a current instrument flight rating, but has the ability to renew his rating.\n[16] Once these requirements are met, Air Canada will reinstate the complainants and they will be eligible to attend the next available training course for the equipment that they are entitled to fly according to their seniority. Upon the successful completion of their training, they would not have to wait for the next equipment bid. They would be placed on the position list at the next monthly bid. The complainants said that they were satisfied with this.\n[17] In terms of training they would need a full training course, ground school, a simulator course and a flight with a line captain. Air Canada estimated that the ground school would be approximately two weeks, the flight simulator course, two weeks and a regular flight with a line captain. To get a course date could take two to three months to at the most.\nIV. Pension Remedy [18] In respect of the pension remedy, the complainants ask that, upon reinstatement, they receive the wages and benefits of an active employee including continual accrual of pension benefits on the same terms and conditions as before their retirement. This is the position put forward by Air Canada in its evidence subject to unwinding the previous pension transactions.\n[19] Unwinding involves the complainants repaying the monthly pension payments received from the start date of their compensation for lost wages to their reinstatement date and remitting the required pension contributions for that period.\n[20] ACPA\u2019s initial view was that an order for continued accrual past age 60 would be contrary to the provisions of the pension plan and beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. However, having agreed to a cease order relating to s.5.1 of the pension plan in favour of the complainants, ACPA no longer maintains this objection.\nV. Compensation for Lost Income and Position on the Seniority List [21] The complainants claim that the compensation period should be the period from the date of their respective retirements to the date of their reinstatement to employment with Air Canada. They claim to be compensated for the income, including bonus and profit-sharing, that they would have earned had they continued in their employment, less any mitigation income and pension payments received in the compensation period.\nA. Vilven [22] For the purpose of determining his loss of income, Vilven used the compensation period from August 31, 2003 to April 30, 2010. His methodology was first, to determine his proxy seniority number, that is, the seniority number on the Air Canada Pilots Seniority List that he would have held for the years 2003 to 2010 if he had not been retired. The next step was to determine his proxy pilot position assignment that he would have held for each of the years based on his proxy seniority number.\n[23] Finally, the monthly income for each of these proxy pilot positions was calculated by reference to the collective agreement pay tables, assuming that the pilots in these positions would have flown schedules according to the following agreed upon by the parties to be reasonable assumptions:\nhourly pay rates as per the collective agreement for the proxy position in the respective compensation periods; 81 hours of flying per month, averaged at half-day, half-night rates of pay plus overseas premium pay for 71hours; monthly pay is multiplied by 12 to obtain an annualized salary for each period.\n(i) Proxy Seniority Number [24] When Vilven retired in August 2003, his seniority number was 1404. For the subsequent years 2004 to 2010, Vilven used pilot C.E. Hintz as his benchmark or proxy pilot. According to Vilven, Hintz was hired by Air Canada one year after Vilven so that if he had not been retired, he would have held Hintz\u2019s seniority position for those years.\n[25] To determine his proxy pilot position. Vilven initially positioned himself as a B747 FO YYZ. He had bid for this position sometime in 2001 but continued to fly as an A340 FO YVR until his retirement. However, from July 2003 to August 2003 he was paid at the rate of a B747 FO YYZ.\n[26] The next step was to strike his proxy cohort for the years 2003 to 2010 which consisted of five pilots senior to him and 5 pilots junior to him who were based in Toronto. His reasoning was that but for Article 25.06.02 of the collective agreement, he would have been awarded that position in 2003.\n[27] By reference to the Air Canada Pilot Position Assignment List for these years and on the basis of his proxy seniority, Vilven concluded that he would have bid and held the positions and seniority set out in Appendix I.\n[28] Applying the pay rates referred to above, Vilven claims his total income would have been $1,086,093 from September 1, 2009 to April 30, 2010. (see Appendix I). This amount does not take into account his pension income received, required pension contributions or mitigation income during that period.\n[29] The question at this point is whether Vilven is justified in using the B747 FO YYZ position as his starting point rather than his retiring position of A340 FO YVR. Under the Air Canada Pilots Pension Plan, a pilot\u2019s pension payout is based on the average of their best five years of earnings which is normally the sixty months prior to their retirement multiplied by their years of service.\n[30] Vilven turned 60 in August 2003. At that time he had 22 years of pensionable service. To maximize his pensionable earnings, Vilven said that his practice was to always exercise his seniority rights to bid a position on a higher aircraft with a higher rate of pay.\n[31] In 1998, Vilven held the position of an A320 FO in Winnipeg. He knew that in August 1998, he was entering his last five years as an Air Canada pilot. But he did not bid for a higher position to maximize his earnings until late 1999 or early 2000 when he exercised his seniority to transfer to Toronto as an A340 FO. When asked why he did not do so earlier, he explained that he made a mistake, he miscalculated.\n[32] About six months later in 2000, Vilven transferred to Vancouver as an A340 FO. He did so knowing that there was no difference in the pay rate between Toronto and Vancouver for an A340 FO. He also recognized that his relative seniority in Vancouver was less than in Toronto so that he would not have the same opportunity to select the more desirable vacation and monthly schedules.\n[33] Vilven explained why he chose to transfer to Vancouver in 2000 as an A340 FO rather than bid for a higher captain position elsewhere. During the Tribunal hearing in January 2007, when this Tribunal was considering the merits of his complaint, he testified that the reason he remained an A340 FO because he wanted to fly the big airplanes and that wasn\u2019t possible if he got promoted on the A320. He also testified that he was raised in Vancouver, his mother, his two sisters and his friends live there and it was only natural that he bid the Vancouver base.\n[34] Vancouver is the most senior base in Air Canada and it was not possible for him to hold a captain\u2019s position there. He said that he could have held a captain\u2019s position in Winnipeg, Toronto or Montreal. But he wanted Vancouver as his base and he wanted to fly internationally. With his years of service it was not possible to do that as a captain.\n[35] Vilven also testified that at times he decided not to exercise his seniority rights because he wanted to stay in a certain city. Vilven also told this Tribunal in the January 2007 hearing that if he was successful in his complaint, he would like to return as an Air Canada pilot in Vancouver.\n[36] In the subsequent remedy hearing before the Tribunal, Vilven said that his previous testimony about why he transferred to Vancouver was not correct. Although his base was Vancouver, he lived in Calgary\/Airdrie, about an hour-and-a-half away. Many Air Canada pilots do not live in the base that they fly from.\n[37] He also said that there is another part to the story. He bid for Vancouver because there were more opportunities to do drafting and simulator work than in Toronto because many of the more senior Vancouver pilots were not willing to work on their days off. He was able to determine this by reviewing the open time and pilots passing flights. At the Toronto base, the flying was more structured and it appeared to him that more senior pilots in Toronto wanted to fly more.\n[38] By doing so, he was able to maximize his earnings. For example, his pensionable earnings as an A340 FO YVR in 2000 were $179,000; in 2001, $175,000; in 2002, $176,000; and for eight months in 2003, $130,000. He could have held the position of an A320 captain, but in contrast an A320 captain earned approximately $165,000 in 2006 and there were no pay raises prior to that time.\n[39] Vilven agreed that when he bid to transfer to Toronto as a B747 FO, he would lose the drafting and simulator work in Vancouver, except he said there might have been some possibilities in Toronto to do that extra work. But he then agreed that he transferred from Toronto to Vancouver in the same position of an A340 FO because he could make more in Vancouver.\n[40] So why move back to Toronto? Vilven said that his reason for bidding the B747 FO YYZ position in 2001 was because there had previously been a pay decrease of approximately 15 percent for Air Canada pilots. The uplift on the B747 was 12 1\/2- percent and by bidding the B747 he was able to mitigate to a large extent the 15% salary reduction.\n[41] He agreed that $179,000 he earned as an A340 FO YVR in 2000 was about $30,000 more than his base A340 FO rate, which is considerably more than 12 1\/2 percent. Vilven\u2019s response was that some of his colleagues who were B747 FOs in Toronto were making in excess of $200,000. There was a lot of opportunity in these years and they were drafting like crazy. When asked why then did he not bid earlier, his response was that he obviously miss-timed it.\n[42] The evidence of Captain Duke from Air Canada is that pilots generally bid the position with the highest salary and regardless of the base in the remaining months prior to retirement, knowing that they will be frozen in their current position under Article 25.06 02 of the collective agreement.\n[43] They do so with the knowledge that they will not have to occupy that position or transfer to another base which may involve moving, taking an aircraft training course and end up as a more junior pilot on the new equipment and suffer a junior schedule.\n[44] So for Vilven it was the best of both worlds. He could retain his monthly bidding privileges of being senior in the A340 FO YVR position, continue his drafting and simulator work and be paid the higher rate of a B747 FO. That is the way the collective agreement is set up and many pilots take advantage of this.\n(ii) Conclusion on Vilven Maximizing His Earnings [45] In my opinion, Vilven has failed to demonstrate a pattern of maximizing his earnings. The facts are that he knew in 1998 that he was entering his final sixty months before retirement. Yet he did not transfer to Toronto until 2000 where he could have increased his pensionable earnings. The reason being that he miscalculated.\n[46] He spent about six months in Toronto and then moved to Vancouver in the same position that he held in Toronto. It seems that he did earn well above his basic A340 FO salary there, but he did not bid for the B747 FO YYZ position until 2001 even though he knew that many of his colleagues were drafting like crazy and earning over $200,000 annually. In this case, his timing was off.\n[47] Vilven\u2019s evidence that he calculated his moves so as to maximize his earnings is not very convincing. He did not do so when the opportunity was there. Although he later disavowed it, his earlier evidence supports the conclusion that his preferred base was Vancouver which was relatively close to his Calgary home and close to his family and friends who lived in Vancouver.\n[48] I prefer the evidence of Capt. Duke that pilots in Vilven\u2019s situation bid for a position knowing that they will not be obliged to change their position. Vilven had the best of both worlds. He remained an A340 FO based in Vancouver, was paid at the B747 FO rate for a time and continued to supplement his income through drafting and simulator work.\n[49] Thus, for the purpose of calculating Vilven\u2019s lost wages, the monthly rate should be that of an A340 FO YVR in effect during the compensation period as determined by the Tribunal.\nB. Kelly, Calculation Loss of Income and Seniority [50] For the purpose of determining his loss of income and seniority, Kelly considered the compensation period to run from May1, 2005 to April 30, 2010. He used the same methodology as Vilven, first, determining his proxy seniority number and then his proxy pilot position assignment for each of the years.\n(i) Proxy Seniority [51] Kelly retired as an A340 YYZ Captain on May 1, 2005. His seniority number on the Air Canada Pilots\u2019 System Seniority list was 79. However, because of the then ICAO rules, he could only fly internationally as a FO and not as a captain until after November 23, 2006. Kelly, at seniority number 79, would have been high on the seniority list and could have held the most senior A340 FO YYZ position.\n[52] For the years 2006 to 2010, in terms of seniority as shown on the Pilots\u2019 System Seniority List, Kelly considered W.C. Ronan as his benchmark or proxy pilot. Tracking the seniority list for these years, Kelly\u2019s seniority number would have been one number below Ronan.\n[53] Next, by reference to the Air Canada Pilot Position Assignment List for those years and on the basis of his proxy seniority number, Kelly concluded that he would have held the seniority and positions set out in Appendix II.\n[54] Kelly provided two calculations for lost income. First, applying the pay rates set out in Appendix II for the proxy pilot assignment positions produces a total income of $1,040,128 from May 1, 2005 to April 30, 2010.\n[55] The other calculation is found in a document Kelly submitted in evidence, Statement of Annual Income, R.N. Kelly. This shows his estimated loss of income from May 2005 to April 2010 to be $341,574.\n[56] Kelly was challenged by ACPA with respect to his proxy pilot scenario which shows that from May 1, 2005 until December 1, 2006 he bid down from an A340 Captain to an A340 FO to satisfy the ICAO standards. After December 1, 2006, he bid up to a captain\u2019s position.\n[57] ACPA pointed out that this does not take into account Article 25.06.06 of the collective agreement which gives Air Canada the discretion to freeze a pilot from changing equipment and\/or status for a period of 48 months.\n[58] The evidence of Captain Duke was that the purpose of Article 25.06.06 is to prevent Air Canada from incurring training costs. It goes against the pattern of a pilot\u2019s general career path, where you start at the bottom of the position hierarchy and move up as your seniority goes up. And along with that you are trained for moving up on to the higher equipment.\n[59] He said the major factor that would be considered in exercising the discretion would be the training costs. He agreed that the training costs to move from the left seat to the right seat on a particular aircraft would be minimal, one or two hours in a simulator and perhaps a line check.\n[60] There are three reasons to discount or ignore this factor. First, the proxy pilot assignment scenario reflects a hypothetical situation. Second, if the training costs are the major consideration and are so minimal, it is not reasonable to conclude that Air Canada would exercise its discretion against the bid particularly where Air Canada has engaged in a discriminatory practice. Third, Air Canada\u2019s expert Alexandra Leslie, in her compensation scenarios, also did not consider Article 25.06.06. So both are on the same footing.\nC. Mitigation (i) Vilven [61] Vilven said that, in 2003, in anticipation of his retirement and to allow him to continue flying, he registered with Park Aviation, a hiring agency in Europe, and emailed a number of European airlines. He did not obtain any employment through these enquiries. He did not produce any of these emails or any employment applications.\n[62] He also said that he called a number of airlines in Canada but it is not apparent in what years he did so. He compiled a list of airlines that he contacted every six months to kind of update his resume. The list did not have dates as to when he did so and he forgot to produce the list at the hearing.\n[63] His evidence was that he would contact the airlines and talk to the chief pilot or their secretary. The airlines he said he contacted included Flair, Skyservice, Air Transat, Kelowna Flightcraft, Arctic Sunwest, Buffalo Airways, Hawk Air, Nolinor Aviation, Morning Star Aviation, Pacific Coastal and Air Saskatchewan. He did not contact Jazz Airline, Air Inuit, Canadian North, Porter Airline, Air Tindi, North Caribou Airline, Prince Edward Air, Provincial Airlines, Regional One Airlines, Trans Capitol Air, Transwest, Air Wasaya Airways, Central Mountain Air, Labrador Airline or Calm Air.\n[64] Vilven felt that there was a bit of a major roadblock as far as getting jobs with these airlines. He told them that he was in the process of filing a human rights complaint and that it was his intention to go back to Air Canada if he could. He wanted them to know this because if they had to spend $15,000 or $20,000 to train him and he might quit shortly after did not seem to him morally or ethically correct.\n[65] Vilven was not employed with any airline from September 2003 until January\/February 2005 when he started flying with Flair Airlines. He stopped flying with Flair in May 2006. At that time he was flying approximately 15 days a month, was paid by the trip and earned about $5,000 a month. Since his retirement he had flown about 150 hours, all with Flair Airlines.\n[66] The reason he left was because Flair had a military contract flying troops back and forth from Trenton to Edmonton and wanted a commitment from him to fly approximately 15 days a month. He would be based in Calgary but flying out of Toronto.\n[67] Vilven said he could not make this commitment because the Tribunal hearing his complaint was scheduled to start in January 2007. He believed that it required a lot of preparation on his part and he would not have the time to prepare if he had to fly. He wanted to devote himself full time to advancing his human rights complaint and thought that this superseded his duty to mitigate his damages.\n[68] Vilven agreed that both the Fly Pass 60 Coalition and the Commission, although not his counsel, represented his interests. He did not produce any records showing the amount of time that he spent preparing for the hearing, but estimated that, between the time he quit Flair and January 2007 when the hearing started, he would put in at least 20 to 30 hours\/ week. In that time he said he read articles and verified certain evidence. His final written argument to the Tribunal amounted to two pages and it took him about four days to write these two pages.\n(ii) Kelly [69] When he retired in May 2005, his rating on the Airbus 330\/340, B757 and B767 was valid until sometime in 2007. He has maintained his category one Aviation Medical and his pilot\u2019s licence\n[70] Kelly started flying with Skyservice in November 2005 and did so until the end of April 2006. He was invited back to Skyservice and was employed there from November 2006 to March 2007, not as a full time employee but as a contract employee without benefits.\n[71] His employment with Skyservice was as a contract flight crew member, initially flying as a first officer the first season and the second season as a captain. He was offered a winter assignment from November 2007 to April 2008 out of Calgary as a first officer. He advised Skyservice that he would accept a position as a first officer based in Toronto or a captain in Calgary, but was told that these positions were not available. For him, it did not make sense financially to operate out of Calgary as a first officer because the hotel costs, commuting and meals would have consumed his entire salary.\n[72] Kelly applied to Jet Airways in November 2007 but was told that because his pilot proficiency check was over two years old, it would require a full course and they were unable to offer him a position at that time.\n[73] From 2005, he consulted various web sites containing information about airlines world-wide for airline pilot positions. He submitted his CV with Park Aviation in 2005 showing his flight experience and aircraft ratings.\n[74] Kelly produced documentation showing the search results and other efforts he made from 2005 to 2010 to obtain employment. He responded to several of these opportunities and also did a job search for airlines within Canada operating the aircraft types for which he was current at the time. He was current when he started applying in 2005 but his currency expired.\n[75] He also contacted Zoom Airlines in 2005 but they were not hiring. He contacted Harmony Airlines but they were in decline at the time and were not hiring pilots. He also did an Internet search for A330 postings for captains in Europe, Australia and Canada. There was a contract position through Park Aviation but they wanted pilots under the age of 50 and who had flown an A330 within the previous six months.\n[76] Because he was no longer current after April 2007 he would have to take a full training course in order to fly commercially at a personal cost of around $40,000. This did not seem to him to be a good investment at this point.\n[77] Kelly said he also made some preliminary inquiries with some of the freight carriers in Canada. However they weren\u2019t prepared to train him at their expense. He recalls contacting Kelowna Flightcraft and Cargo Jet during the period 2007 and 2008.\n[78] His view was that the prospects of gaining alternative employment after Skyservice were fairly remote unless he invested in an endorsement on an aircraft in demand and pay for the retraining costs.\n[79] He did indicate, however, that there were opportunities to fly overseas as a contract employee in 2006 and 2007. But he elected not to do summer operations because they operated in Europe and he didn\u2019t want to be away from his family for the entire year.\n[80] Kelly\u2019s assessment of the job market was that in 2007 there was a shortage of pilots worldwide especially in India and China. But there was limited demand within Canada. His position was that were he to transfer to an airline based in India for example, it would involve about a six month training period to qualify. His experience was that the bureaucracy was not favourable to contract expats taking flying jobs in India. He had done many trips to India and frankly it was not a place he would prefer to live. He chose Canada as a country to live and he prefers to live and work in Canada.\n[81] His son-in-law flies for Air Georgia out of Toronto. But Kelly was not qualified on any aircraft that Air Georgia operates. He could have qualified on a turbo prop aircraft at his cost of about $30,000, but he was anticipating a return to Air Canada.\n(iii) Conclusion on Mitigation [82] The respondents argue that the complainants have a duty to mitigate their damages and cite the Chopra decision as support for this. In the case of Vilven, they say that he failed to do so limiting his job searches and declining to continue with Flair Airlines after May 2006 to devote himself to preparing his human rights complaint. Because of his failure to satisfy his obligation to mitigate, the respondents ask that the Tribunal should not award him any compensation for lost wages.\n[83] As for Kelly, the respondents recognize that he made greater efforts to find employment but characterize his attempts as falling somewhat short of the mark. They list his unwillingness to work overseas in the summer months with Skyservice outside of Canada, or seek a pilot position overseas because he chose to live and work in Canada and the fact that he declined a third winter with Skyservice because he did not think it financially advantageous. The respondents request that the Tribunal discount any award of compensation to Kelly for lost wages by 50 per cent.\n[84] Chopra does not impose a duty on the complainants to mitigate their damages. The decision of the Federal Court of Appeal reads otherwise. The Court agreed with the appellant Dr. Chopra, that there is no legal requirement under the CHRA that the doctrine of mitigation be invoked to limit to limit compensation for lost wages.\n[85] The Tribunal, given its jurisdiction to award compensation for any or all of lost wages, has the discretion to apply the doctrine of mitigation but it is not bound to do so.\n[86] I decline to exercise this discretion in favour of the respondents and impose the duty to mitigate on the complainants. The complainants are the victims of the discriminatory practice not the respondents. Clearly the complainants have suffered loss of income. Yet, as set out later in this decision, for reasons of the Charter and the principle of limited immunity, the amount of the award for lost wages has been substantially reduced from the amounts claimed.\n[87] Now the respondents, in the case of Vilven, ask for even more, that the award for his lost wages be zero. And for Kelly, only 50 per cent. In these circumstances, there is no principled basis for the Tribunal to accede to the respondents\u2019 request.\nVI. Pain and Suffering A. Vilven [88] Vilven claims $20,000 as compensation for pain and suffering, the maximum under s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA. In terms of how his forced retirement affected him personally, he said flying has always been a significant part of his life. Most of his friends are pilots who continue to fly but he was not able to do so.\n[89] Vilven said that the impact on his personal life is that he paid a terrible price for instituting and pursuing his complaint. His wife is extremely disappointed and saddened the way he\u2019s been treated. He has lost family friends. He was told that at the Winnipeg retirement dinner for Air Canada pilots on June 16, 2006, there was a mannequin portraying him in a very unflattering way. He said his wife would have been very upset if she had been there and so would he but he did not attend that dinner.\nB. Kelly [90] Kelly is claiming $20,000 for pain and suffering. He said that the impact of the termination of employment at Air Canada on his personal life has been very difficult. He has lost the comradeship of a lot of friends. He has lost the ability to visit regularly with his son who was resident in Hong Kong and which was a regular destination when he was flying.\n[91] Kelly says that he\u2019s been employed continuously since the age of 16 and this is the first time in his life that he hasn\u2019t been employed. He finds it\u2019s very damaging to his dignity and sense of self worth, particularly the fact that he still has two younger children, one in university and one still in high school. He has to rely on his wife to earn the additional income required to maintain their lifestyle when he is perfectly fit and able to continue employment. He said relationships with friends have been strained.\nC. Conclusion on Pain and Suffering [92] With respect to Vilven and Kelly claims for pain and suffering, in my opinion these claims should not be allowed. They both ask for the maximum of $20,000 without explaining why they are entitled to the maximum. The Tribunal jurisprudence clearly indicates that the maximum award is reserved for the most egregious discriminatory practice. The facts presented by the complainants do not meet this standard.\n[93] Rather the facts of this case militate against any award for pain and suffering. From the time Vilven and Kelly joined Air Canada they were well aware of the mandatory retirement age of 60. Yet they did nothing to challenge this as being discriminatory until after they were retired from Air Canada at age 60.\n[94] On the contrary, they benefitted from this discriminatory practice by being able to move up more quickly in terms of seniority, higher paid positions, preferred monthly schedules and vacation schedules. This was because the pilots ahead of and more senior to them were obliged to retire at age 60.\n[95] As this Tribunal noted in its earlier decision on liability, the complainants may be unhappy about ending their rewarding pilots careers with Air Canada but that situation cannot be viewed in isolation. It must be seen in the context of a system that was designed to assign the responsibilities and benefits of being a pilot at Air Canada over different stages in their careers. All pilots at Air Canada understand that they will share these benefits and burdens equally at the appropriate stages in their careers.\nVII. Wilful and Reckless Damages [96] Vilven and Kelly also claim $20,000 against each respondent under 53(3) of the CHRA. They say that the respondents were fully aware that there were no negative consequences if the complainants continued with Air Canada. It would require only a small adjustment and the respondents could have accommodated this request within the ICAO standards.\n[97] Yet the respondents refused to do so even after the Tribunal finding of a discriminatory practice. This demonstrates, argue the complainants, a wanton and reckless disregard for the rights of older pilots in favour of the interests of the younger pilots. As such, this calls for a substantial award of special compensation.\nA. Conclusion on Wilful and Reckless Damages [98] Section 53(3) of the CHRA allows for an award of special compensation where it is found that the person is engaging in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. In this case the discriminatory practice engaged by the respondents was applying the policy of mandatory retirement found in the pension plan and collective agreement, which presumably was agreed upon some time ago through the process of collective bargaining by Air Canada and ACPA representing the pilots.\n[99] It was only by the Tribunal\u2019s August 2009 decision that the mandatory retirement policy was found to be discriminatory. Prior to that time the respondents were entitled to and did rely on the established legal authorities that such a policy did not offend the Charter or human rights legislation. It was reasonable for the respondents to apply this policy and in so doing they cannot be said to have acted wilfully or recklessly.\n[100] The question that remains is whether the respondents have acted wilfully or recklessly by refusing to reinstate the complainants immediately after the policy was found to be discriminatory. In my view, the answer is no.\n[101] Reinstatement is one of the remedies sought by the complainants. All parties agreed to bifurcate the hearing into liability and remedy. Reinstatement does not necessarily flow from a finding of liability. Further, even if reinstatement was ordered, there still remained the question of the complainant\u2019s position on the seniority list. This question is in dispute between the parties. For the respondents to await a Tribunal decision on remedy does not amount to wilful or reckless conduct.\nVIII. Other Expenses [102] Both Vilven and Kelly have claimed out-of-pocket expenses. These are detailed on Exhibit C-18. Items 1 to 6 are for hotel, meals and travel expenses incurred to attend the hearing both as witnesses and as observers.\nA. Conclusion of Other Expenses [103] The Tribunal has the discretion under s.53(2)(c) of the CHRA to award compensation for expenses incurred as a result of the discriminatory practice. In Warman v. Winnicki, [2006] C.H.R.D No.18,the Tribunal concluded that travel, accommodation and meal expenses are not the kind of expenses contemplated by this section because they are not directly related to presenting a case to the Tribunal. They are one step removed. This was so even though the complainant in Warman appeared as a witness and provided evidence at the hearing.\n[104] The Tribunal noted that counsel in Warman could not refer to any authority to support an award for these types of expenses. Nor did the complainants in this case provide any authority for their position that they should be reimbursed for expenses incurred to attend the hearing as witnesses or observers.\n[105] Items 7, 8 and 9 relate to supplemental life insurance, retirement supplemental health plan and additional cost-health plan. Air Canada provided these benefits that ended upon retirement. There is no evidence whether the benefits were fully funded by Air Canada or whether there were employee contributions.\n[106] The basis of the complainants\u2019 claim is that they now have to wholly fund these benefits. But to participate in these plans were at the option of the complainants. Further, they would have retired at some point in the near future and the expenses that they now claim have been slightly accelerated. In any case there is no substantiation of the amounts shown on Exhibit C-18. The same is true for Vilven\u2019s claim for Item 16, Air Canada pass charges.\n[107] As for Items 10 to 15, bonus and profit sharing, these amounts are included in Air Canada\u2019s compensation calculations and are allowed, subject to adjustment to reflect the compensation period determined by this Tribunal. Accordingly, compensation for items 10 to 15 only is awarded.\nIX. Air Canada\/ACPA Calculation of Loss of Income and Seniority [108] In determining loss of income and seniority, Air Canada put forward alternative scenarios. The first scenario is: No Compensation Until August 28, 2009 (date of the Tribunal\u2019s second decision).The second alternative scenario is: Period of Compensation Limited to Two years.\n[109] Both scenarios contemplate that Vilven and Kelly would be reinstated to full service effective April 1, 2010. Once the reinstatement occurs, Vilven and Kelly would receive wages and benefits of an active employee which would include continued accrual of pension benefits on the same terms and conditions as before their retirement.\n[110] Under the first Scenario, the compensation period would run from September 1, 2009 (being the first complete month following the second Tribunal decision) to April 1, 2010. No compensation would be paid for any period prior to September 1, 2009.\n[111] Air Canada and ACPA take the position that, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Attorney General) v. Hyslop, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 429, if certain criteria as set out in that decision are satisfied, no retroactive compensation should be granted. This is in contrast to Vilven and Kelly who claim that the compensation period should be from the date of their retirement to the date of their reinstatement.\nA. Scenario One: No Compensation Until August 28, 2009 [112] To calculate their loss of income, the proxy seniority positions that Vilven and Kelly would have held on September 1, 2009 must first be determined. Air Canada took the position that, to be consistent, if no compensation should be awarded for the period prior to September 1, 2009, similarly, no seniority should be credited prior to that period.\n(i) Vilven [113] To determine Vilven\u2019s seniority as of that date, Air Canada reasoned this way. In the case of Vilven, as six years had elapsed between his retirement date and the Tribunal\u2019s decision, six years of seniority growth should be deducted from the elapsed time since his hire date (carveout).\n[114] Vilven was hired by Air Canada in May 1986. To reflect the carveout, Air Canada added six years to Vilven\u2019s date of hire in May 1986, giving him an adjusted hire date of May 1992. As no pilots were hired between 1989 and 1993, Vilven\u2019s seniority number at September 1, 2009 would be one lower than the last pilot hired in 1989. Air Canada determined this to be Captain Di Stazio whose seniority number in 2009 was 1221. Therefore Vilven\u2019s proxy seniority number would be 1222.\n[115] At retirement, Vilven was an A340 FO YVR. At September 1, 2009, seniority number 1222 on the pilot position assignment list would allow a Vancouver based first officer to hold an A340 FO position.\n[116] Applying the basic monthly salary rate for an A340 FO for seven months, plus an amount for bonuses and profit sharing and pension paid, Air Canada calculated Vilven\u2019s loss of income including bonus\/profit sharing for the period September 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 to be $88,984. Deducting $39,036 for pension reimbursement and $4,051 for required pension contributions, leaves a net loss of income or compensation payable of $45,897.\n(ii) Kelly [117] As to Kelly\u2019s seniority, four years and four months elapsed between his retirement date and September 1, 2009. As he was hired in September 1972, his carveout or adjusted date of hire would be January 1977. His proxy seniority number as of September 1, 2009 would be 176. As such, he could hold the position of B777 Captain with the highest salary rate. Using the same method as used for Vilven, Air Canada calculated his net loss of income or compensation for the period to be $62,711.\nB. Scenario Two: Period of Compensation Limited to Two Years [118] In this alternative Scenario, Vilven and Kelly would only be compensated for two years of lost income, namely, the two years immediately following their date of retirement.\n[119] They would be reinstated effective April 1, 2010 and after reinstatement they would receive wages and benefits as an active employee and continue to accrue pension benefits on the same terms and conditions as before their retirement.\n(i) Kelly [120] In this Scenario, Air Canada calculated Kelly\u2019s compensation for loss of income for the period to be $42,376. This amount is based on lost wages and bonus\/profit sharing of $384,891; less income from other sources, $65,825; less reimbursement of pension paid, $258,683; less employee required pension contributions, $18,007.\n[121] This calculation was done on the basis of taking Kelly\u2019s seniority and determining the positions he could hold between May 1, 2005 and May 1, 2007. He was very high on the seniority list, but because of the ICAO standards he could only fly internationally as a B777 FO from May 2005 until November 2006 and as a B777 Captain until May 1, 2010.\n[122] The salary he would have earned was based on 81 flying hours per month and the relevant salary rates for the B777 FO for 2005 and 2006. For 2007, it was based on the average of his peer group. In fact, however, there was little difference between the average monthly salary of the peer group of $19,792 in 2007 and the monthly salary of a B777 Captain of $19,434 in December 2006. The use of the peer group analysis was of little consequence for Kelly.\n(ii) Vilven [123] Under this Scenario, Air Canada used a peer group analysis. In contrast to Vilven who located himself as a B744 FO YYZ at retirement, the peer group for Vilven consisted of A340 YVR pilots, the same position Vilven had at retirement, five of whom were immediately above and five immediately below him relative to his position on the seniority list at his retirement date. The average pensionable earnings of the peer group of ten pilots were then tracked for the years September 2004 to September 2005.\n[124] Air Canada considered the peer group analysis more appropriate than Vilven\u2019s pilot cohort because the group of 10 pilots remained unchanged throughout the analysis period. Any individual choices in terms of changing equipment, status or base would be automatically reflected as would earnings without having to make hypothetical decisions as to when an individual would exercise the various options that they have under the collective agreement. Whereas with the Vilven pilot cohort approach, there was a change in position every year.\n[125] Air Canada\u2019s position is that the peer analysis requires less judgement because it starts with Vilven and his position at the time of his retirement and follows his peer group forward. It is based on actual decisions rather than on an hypothesis of what may or may not have happened. The peer group had similar seniority to Vilven, who also had the option of bidding into the Toronto base and becoming a first officer on a B767 and they did not do so.\n[126] Air Canada calculated Vilven\u2019s loss of income for those two years to be $178,989, comprised of lost wages and bonus\/profit sharing of $337,807; less mitigation income of $15,767; less pension reimbursement of $126,770; less employee pension contributions of $16,281.\n[127] Air Canada seeks to support the two year compensation period on the basis of the expert evidence of Alexandra Leslie. In her opinion, if the pension plan had been amended to remove the mandatory retirement age of 60, the average retirement age of two years would be at the outside bounds of what an anticipated increase would be.\n[128] She pointed out that the vast majority of Air Canada pilots retire at 60. Should mandatory retirement be removed, her expectation would be that a large number would continue to retire at 60 simply because it has been a policy for so long. From an individual planning perspective, individuals tend to focus on that and it will take time for the de facto retirement age to move away from 60.\n[129] It is interesting to note that there is much similarity between the Vilven cohort analysis and the Air Canada peer group analysis. Both use ten pilots, five above and five below Vilven by seniority. Both use the A340 position for the 2005 period. The difference is in the bottom line dollar amount for the two year period is attributable to the difference in the pay rate for a B747 FO and an A340 in 2003 and 2004.\nC. Conclusion on Compensation for Lost Wages [130] The complainants assert that the only limiting factors on their claim to be compensated for the period from retirement to reinstatement are that their claim must be causally connected to the discriminatory practice and their efforts at mitigation must be reasonable. (Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), [2007] F.C.J.1134.\n[131] The respondents argue that there is another factor limiting the compensation and that is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Attorney General) v. Hyslop, 2007 SCC 10. On the basis of Hyslop, the Tribunal should not grant a retroactive remedy, i.e. it should not award any compensation for lost wages for the period prior to August 28, 2009.\n[132] The complainants disagree that Hyslop should have this effect. That the Supreme Court decision in Nova Scotia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Martin, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 504 makes it clear that, apart from the limiting factors set out above, the Tribunal has full remedial authority to make both prospective and retroactive awards.\n[133] In Martin, there were two appellants. The appellant, Martin, suffered a workplace injury in February 1996, returned to work several times but ultimately had to stop work. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Board provided him with temporary disability and rehabilitation benefits. When these benefits were terminated in August 1996, he applied for a review of the decision but his claim was denied by the WCB.\n[134] The other appellant, Laseur, also suffered a workplace injury, received temporary disability benefits, attempted to return to work but was unable to do so. She applied for a permanent partial disability award and vocational rehabilitation assistance. Both were denied.\n[135] Both appealed these decisions to the WCB Appeals Tribunal, Martin arguing that s.10B and certain regulations under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act infringed s. 15(1) of the Charter. The Appeals Tribunal found the legislation contravened the Charter and that Martin was entitled to temporary loss of earnings benefits and medical aid up to October 1996. The Nova Court of Appeal reversed this and the case found its way to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[136] The primary issue at the Supreme Court was whether the Appeals Tribunal had the jurisdiction to apply the Charter. The Court concluded that the Appeals Tribunal did have such jurisdiction and did correctly decide that the impugned legislation offended the Charter. In the result, the Supreme Court ordered that the decision of the Appeals Tribunal be restored and that Martin should receive the benefits that he claimed.\n[137] As to Laseur, the Appeals Tribunal refused to grant her the benefits that she had claimed because she had not challenged the validity of the applicable legislation. The Supreme Court in this situation sent the matter back to the Appeals Tribunal to decide the Charter issue if she raised it and her entitlement to the benefits claimed in accordance with the Court\u2019s decision.\n[138] In Martin, the Supreme Court decided three questions. First, that the Appeals Tribunal had the jurisdiction to decide Charter issues relating to the provisions of its enabling statute; second, that the provisions in question were contrary to s.15(1) of the Charter and were not saved by s.1; and third, the constitutional remedies available to the Appeals Tribunal were limited to disregarding the impugned provisions and ruling on the applicant\u2019s claim as if the provisions were not in force. It did not deal with the question of when a retroactive remedy should or should not be awarded.\n[139] Whether it was because the Appeals Tribunal did not apply these provisions or because the Supreme Court decided that they were of no force and effect, the result for Martin was the same. He was awarded the retroactive benefits he sought because there was no longer any legal basis to deny them.\n[140] The Vilven and Kelly situation is different. What this Tribunal decided on the Charter issue was that s.15(1)(c) of the CHRA was not available as a defense for the respondents. But this finding did not trigger any remedies. It did not operate in the same way as the decision in Martin. It did not confer on the complainants any remedy. That remained to be determined.\n[141] The facts in Hyslop are as follows. To be entitled to a survivor\u2019s pension under the Canada Pension Plan, the survivor had to be married to the contributor or be a common-law partner of the opposite sex in a conjugal relationship at the time of the contributor\u2019s death.\n[142] If so qualified, the survivor could apply for a survivor\u2019s pension which would be payable for each month after the death of the contributor. If the application was not received within 12 months of the contributor\u2019s death, the arrears that could be claimed were limited to the 12 months preceding the receipt of the application.\n[143] In 2000, following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in M v. H, [1999] 2 S.C.R.3, the federal government amended the CPP to extend survivor benefits to same-sex partners by changing the definition of common-law partner so that there was no reference to the gender of the partner.\n[144] In addition to this amendment, ss. 44(1.1), 72(1) and 72(2) were added to the CPP. Under s. 44(1.1), a same-sex survivor would not be eligible for survivor\u2019s pension unless they became survivors after January 1, 1998. Section 72(2) precluded payments to survivors for any month before July 2000 irrespective of when the same-sex partner became eligible.\n[145] The effect of this provision was to preclude any retroactive survivor benefits to same-sex survivors including the opportunity to seek up to 12 months of pension arrears which was available to opposite-sex survivors under s.72(1). Section 72(2) came to an end as of June 2001, because after that date, same-sex and opposite-sex partners were treated the same under s. 72(1).\n[146] Hyslop was a class action and the position of the class was that same-sex survivors whose contributing partner died any time after April 17, 1985, should be entitled to retroactive benefits to the month following the death of their same-sex partner.\n[147] The Supreme Court found that s. 44(1.1) and s.72(2) infringed the Charter and then considered the question of the appropriate remedy. As a starting point, the Court noted that where the offending provision is declared unconstitutional, the result under s. 52(1) of the Charter, is the nullification of the law from the outset. In such case, the courts generally grant retroactive remedies.\n[148] However, where the law changes through judicial intervention, it may be appropriate for a court to limit the retroactive effect of its judgement, that is, apply the principle of limited immunity. Under this principle, it is a general rule of public law that, absent conduct that is clearly wrong, in bad faith or an abuse of power, the courts will not award damages for the harm suffered as a result of the mere enactment or application of a law that is subsequently declared to be unconstitutional. (Makin and Guimond v. Quebec, [1996] 3 S.C.R.347, para. 78).\n[149] To justify a prospective remedy only, the Supreme Court required that the threshold requirement of a substantial change in the law must be satisfied. Once this is met, other factors such as reasonable reliance, good faith, fairness to litigants and respecting parliament\u2019s role must be considered.\n[150] For the Supreme Court in Hyslop, the substantial change in the law came in the Court\u2019s earlier decision in M v. H, which the Court considered to be a marked departure from the pre-existing jurisprudence on same sex equality rights. Prior to M v. H, the Court had held that the Constitution did not require equal benefits for same-sex couples.\n[151] As to the other factors, the Court concluded that the denial of benefits to same-sex partners under the former CPP was reasonable given the previous state of the s. 15(1) equality jurisprudence. The government did not act in bad faith in failing to extend same-sex survivor benefits pre M v. H. And imposing liability for payment of arrears that could reach as far back as 1985, in the absence of bad faith, unreasonable reliance or wrongful conduct, would undermine the balance between the protection of constitutional rights and the need for effective government.\n[152] In my opinion, the Tribunal\u2019s August 28, 2009 decision represents a clear departure from the existing state of the law. Prior to the Tribunal\u2019s decision s. 15(1)(c) was available as a defence for employers to a claim under the CHRA that a mandatory retirement policy was discriminatory.\n[153] The Supreme Court of Canada, from McKinney and going forward, has consistently concluded that legislative provisions permitting mandatory retirement were justifiable limitations under s.1 of the Charter. (see McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 229; Harrison v. University of British Columbia, [1990] 3 S.C.R.451; Dickason v. University of Alberta [1992] 2 S.C.R 1103; Stoffman v. Vancouver General Hospital, [1990] 3 S.C.R.483).\n[154] Apart from the recent decision of the Manitoba Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in CKY-TV v C.EP. Local 816, 252, which was subsequent to the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Vilven and Kelly, the Federal Court and arbitrators have accepted this provision as constituting a valid defense.\n[155] In terms of the other considerations, reasonable reliance, good faith and fairness to the litigants, as the Supreme Court noted in Hyslop that, an approach to constitutional interpretation that makes it possible to identify, in appropriate cases, a point in time when the law changed, makes it easier to ensure that persons and legislatures who relied on the former legal rule while it prevailed will be protected. In this way, a balance is struck between the legitimate interests of actors who make decisions based on a reasonable assessment of the state of the law at the relevant time on the one hand and the need to allow constitutional jurisprudence to evolve over time on the other.\n[156] Given the then state of the law, the respondents acted in good faith and reasonably in applying the mandatory retirement policy to the complainants. As to considerations of fairness to the litigants, in my view, a fair balance is struck, on the one hand, by not imposing on the respondents the burden of damages for a policy that was legal at the time, and, on the other hand, by awarding damages to the complainants from the time the policy was declared to be illegal.\n[157] I conclude that Hyslop should apply in this case and that the complainants should not be awarded any compensation for lost wages prior to August 28, 2009. This being the case, it is not necessary to decide the respondents\u2019 alternative position that the compensation period should be limited to two years from the date of the complainants\u2019 retirement.\nD. Conclusion on Seniority [158] It is well established in human rights jurisprudence that the purpose of awarding a remedy is to make whole the victim of the discrimination in the appropriate circumstances. This suggests that Vilven and Kelly should be credited with the seniority that they would have accrued had they not been retired, unless there is some reason for discounting their seniority.\n[159] According to their calculations as detailed earlier in this decision, Vilven\u2019s seniority number on reinstatement in 2010 would be 751 and Kelly\u2019s seniority would be 5. The respondents, relying on the carveout, concluded that the complainants should return with seniority number 1222 for Vilven and 176 for Kelly.\n[160] In coming to this conclusion, the respondents use this logic. First they say that in the pilot world, the collective agreement is structured on seniority and this drives compensation. As pilots progress in seniority they have the ability to bid on the higher equipment which pays the higher salary.\n[161] Thus the respondents argue, if seniority is equated with compensation, then Hyslop should apply. To allow the complainants to accrue seniority prior to August 28, 2009 would be contrary to the principle that the respondents are entitled to rely on the law as it was prior to the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n[162] But as the evidence shows, seniority also determines benefits other than just compensation. For example pilot position (equipment, status and base), monthly schedules, vacation schedules, working conditions, layoffs are all tied to seniority.\n[163] Seniority gives pilots lifestyle choices. Some may forego compensation for a preferred base or a better monthly or vacation schedule. Hyslop did not consider the question of seniority and retroactive remedies. If seniority cannot be tied exclusively to compensation, then Hyslop should not apply.\n[164] Further, in limiting retroactive relief, Hyslop requires that fairness to the litigants be considered. In my opinion, the balance in terms of fairness, favors the complainants. The complainants are two in number. There is no evidence that their reinstatement at the seniority numbers they claim would have any negative effect on Air Canada\u2019s operations. As for ACPA, awarding this seniority to Vilven and Kelly does not result in them jumping ahead. They merely maintain their seniority position as if not retired. Some ACPA members may be displeased, but as this Tribunal noted in its earlier decision, it would only delay the younger pilots\u2019 seniority progression.\n[165] For these reasons, I have concluded that Vilven and Kelly should be reinstated with seniority number 751 for Vilven and seniority number 5 for Kelly.\nE. Previous Financial Advantage Due to Mandatory Retirement [166] The respondents ask that any compensation awarded to Vilven or Kelly be discounted to reflect the fact that their careers progressed and were accelerated in an employment environment where mandatory retirement applied. Previous and current Air Canada pilots such as Vilven and Kelly have benefited from being hired earlier and promoted faster due to the existence of the mandatory retirement age.\n[167] They argue that Vilven and Kelly have the freedom to work as long as they are qualified without enduring any offsetting delay. So the question is, should the fact that Vilven and Kelly have not suffered any offsetting delay in career progression be a factor in determining their compensation. In other words, should they get the benefits without paying the price.\n[168] Air Canada asked its expert witness Ms. Leslie to quantify this previous financial advantage. She acknowledged that such an exercise would be hypothetical because it depends in large part on the average age of the pilots in the absence of mandatory retirement which is unknown.\n[169] Ms. Leslie hypothesized that if the average age increased by two years, current pilots would have benefited by a two year acceleration throughout their careers. The only facts that she could offer on this question was that the average age of retirement in the Air Canada pilots plan is 59.2, and that the vast majority of their pilots retire on their normal retirement date. What is not known is if mandatory retirement was removed, how many pilots would still retire at age 60 and how many of them would retire at what age in the future.\n[170] Ms. Leslie concluded that, assuming the average age to retirement was delayed for two years and given Kelly\u2019s final average pensionable earnings of $224,000, a decent approximation of the financial advantage that he obtained through the existence of mandatory retirement would be in the order of $450,000. For Vilven with his final average earnings of $167,000 and assuming two years, Ms. Leslie said that would amount to about $334,000.\n[171] Ms. Leslie acknowledged that this was only a rough approximation and her attempt to quantify the advantage has weaknesses. Further, she also agreed that she was not suggesting that the complainants\u2019 compensation be reduced by those amounts, but only that the compensation should be discounted. Air Canada left it to the Tribunal to calculate the discount.\nF. Conclusion on Previous Financial Advantage [172] There are problems with this claim. Even assuming that there has been a financial advantage, the basis for quantifying the amount is very weak. It is impressionistic rather than factual. Further, if the discount is to be less than 100 per cent, what should it be. In the absence of any formula from the respondents, it is not for the Tribunal to guess.\n[173] Finally, in my view, the respondents are more than overreaching by asking for this discount. By seeking to apply Hyslop, the respondents have in effect reduced the complainants\u2019 compensation by approximately six years and four years respectively, considerably more than the two years suggested by Ms. Leslie. Their request for a further reduction is rejected.\nX. Order [174] The Tribunal orders as follows:\nThe respondents are to cease applying to the complainants, s.5.1 of the Air Canada Pilots Pension Plan and the corresponding provisions of the collective agreement Plan; The complainants are to be reinstated to employment as pilots with Air Canada as of the date of this decision on condition that they have a valid pilot licence, a valid medical certificate showing that they are fit to fly a commercial aircraft under the applicable Transport Canada medical standards and a current instrument flight rating; Upon reinstatement, the complainants shall be enrolled in the next available training course for the equipment that they are entitled to fly according to their seniority. Upon the successful completion of their training, they shall be scheduled for flying at the next opportunity for monthly bidding and placed on the pilot position list. Upon reinstatement, Vilven is to hold seniority number 751 and Kelly, seniority number 5 on the pilots\u2019 seniority list. Upon reinstatement, the complainants are to receive the wages and benefits of an active employee including continual accrual of pension benefits on the same terms and conditions as before their retirement. The complainants are to be compensated by the respondents for lost income for the period from September 1, 2009 to the date of their reinstatement as active employees. The compensation is to be calculated on the basis of the monthly salary for the position of 81 hours of flying per month, averaged at half-day, half-night rates of pay, plus overseas premium pay for 71 hours. The compensation shall include any profit sharing\/bonus paid in that period. Vilven shall be compensated at the salary rate of an A340 FO and Kelly at the salary rate of a B777 Captain until April 30, 2010 and thereafter at the salary rate of a B777 FO. The compensation for lost wages shall be net of the amounts of the pension paid to the complainants from September 1, 2009 to the date of their reinstatement. The respondents are to pay interest on the net amount of the compensation from September 1, 2009 until the compensation is paid.

Lustig Date: November 9, 2010 Citation: 2010 CHRT 28\n[1] This is a ruling on the motion of the Respondent for an order that the Complaints in this matter be adjourned sine die, or alternatively to January 31, 2011 to allow for the passage of Bill C-3 currently before the House of Commons.\n[2] The Complainants who are siblings, have each filed Complaints in virtually identical form, alleging that the Respondent has discriminated against them by denying them entitlement to be registered as Indians in the Indian Register under s.6 of the Indian Act. The Complaints were signed on December 6, 2008 and allege that the denial of eligibility to be registered as an Indian is a discriminatory practice based both ... upon the prohibited grounds of family status and gender under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[3] For the purposes of this Ruling it suffices to describe the Complainant\u2019s situation as follows:\nThe Complainants were all born before 1985. They have one Indian grandparent: a woman who lost status when she married a non-Indian before 1985, and who regained her status under s. 6 (1) (c) of the Indian Act with the passage of the Bill C-31 amendments in 1985. By virtue of those same amendments, the children of her marriage with a non-Indian man (one of whom was the Complainants\u2019 father) were deemed eligible for status under s. 6 (2) of the Indian Act. Since the 1985 amendments only gave their father status under s. 6 (2), and since their mother was a non-Indian, the Complainants have never been entitled to status. As a result, the children they have had with non-Indians since 1985 also are not entitled to status. The Complainants have prepared and delivered a chart that sets out their family and status history as compared to a hypothetical family history that is identical in all respects, save for the sex of their Indian grandparent. In other words, in the hypothetical family history, their Indian grandparent is male instead of female. All dates of births, marriages and deaths are consistent in both scenarios. As shown in the chart, the Complainants in the hypothetical patrilineal scenario would have status under s. 6 (1) of the Indian Act, and would be able to pass s. 6 (2) status to their children. he Complainants allege that this differential treatment, flowing from discrimination in the Indian Act, has two principal adverse effects: first, they are themselves denied status, and the benefits that flow there from; and second, they are denied the opportunity to pass status to their children.\n[4] On November 9, 2009 the Complaints in this matter were referred by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) to this Tribunal pursuant to s.49 of the CHRA for a hearing.\n[5] On April 6, 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal rendered its decision in the matter of McIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs) wherein it declared s. 6 (1)(a) and s. 6 (1)(c) of the Indian Act to be of no force or effect as these provisions infringed the plaintiff\u2019s right to equality under s.15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (the Charter) and that the infringement is not justified by s. 1 of the Charter. The British Columbia Court of Appeal suspended its declaration for a period of one year and subsequently extended the suspension on two occasions - the last of which took place on July 5, 2010 until January 31, 2011, to allow Parliament time to review and consider new amendments to the Indian Act.\n[6] The McIvor matter concerned the constitutionality of s. 6 of the Indian Act which establishes the entitlement of a person to be registered as an Indian. This is the same provision that is at issue in the Complaints before the Tribunal since the Complainants take issue with the refusal of the Office of the Indian Registrar (the OIR) to register them as Indians notwithstanding the McIvor decision.\n[7] As the law currently stands, the Complainants are not entitled to be registered, and the OIR cannot register an individual unless they meet the legal requirements for registration. Following the McIvor decision, the Crown introduced Bill C-3, being an Act to promote gender equity in Indian registration by responding to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia decision in McIvor v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs) which is currently before Parliament.\n[8] A previous Notice of Motion was filed by the Respondent on April 7, 2010 requesting an adjournment of these matters. The Commission and the Complainants both filed submissions in response to the Notice of Motion of the Respondent and agreed to the request for an adjournment. By letter to the parties dated March 20, 2010, the Tribunal agreed to adjourn the proceedings to a date in July of 2010 when a case management call to update matters was to be held.\n[9] At the conference call on July 6, 2010 the parties discussed the status of Bill C-3 including the fact that the Bill had not by then been passed and the House of Commons, where it was still in Committee, had been adjourned until September 20, 2010. The parties also discussed the fact that the British Columbia Court of Appeal had granted an extension until January 31, 2011 to allow Parliament to amend the Indian Act following its decision in McIvor.\n[10] The following is a summary of how Bill C-3 has progressed since its introduction:\nBill C-3 passed first reading in the House of Commons on March 11, 2010, and second reading on March 29, 2010. After second reading Bill C-3 was referred to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development (AANO) for further study and consideration. A number of witnesses who appeared before AANO stated their views that the legislation as drafted would not eliminate residual sex discrimination in the registration provisions of the Indian Act. Several witnesses pointed specifically to the same continuing differential treatment that the Complainants have identified in this case. After considering the presentations of witnesses and conducting a clause-by-clause review, AANO agreed to report Bill C-3 back to the House of Commons with various amendments. After Bill C-3 was reported back to the House of Commons, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government raised a point of order, arguing that the AANO amendments improperly expanded the scope of Bill C-3. On May 11, 2010, the Speaker ruled that the AANO amendments to clause 2 of Bill C-3 exceeded the scope of the bill as set by the House at second reading, and were therefore inadmissible and null and void. He further directed that Bill C-3 be reprinted in a manner consistent with his ruling. Although some further discussion on the AANO report took place in the House on May 25, 2010, the debate was not concluded when the House adjourned for the summer on June 17, 2010 until September 20, 2010. The House of Commons has not done anything with the Bill since it resumed on September 20, 2010.\n[11] As there was disagreement between the parties at the July 6th case management call on whether a further adjournment of these matters ought to be allowed, as requested by the Respondent, the Tribunal issued directions to the Respondent to perfect its adjournment Motion by filing a Notice of Motion, Affidavit and written submissions and for the Complainants and Commission to file their responding submissions and for the Respondent to file its reply to those submissions.\n[12] Following the directions referred to above, the Respondent has filed its Notice of Motion requesting the adjournment referred to above, together with its submissions and Affidavit material and the Complainants and the Commission have filed their submissions objecting to the request for the adjournment by the Respondent and the Respondent has filed its reply to those submissions.\n[13] The Respondent\u2019s submissions, in summary, are as follows:\nThe passage of new legislation i.e. Bill C-3 may resolve the Complaints or, in the alternative, materially change the nature of their Complaints such that any decision of the Tribunal would be moot; The Complaints, as currently structured, would require the Respondent to defend legislative provisions that were found unconstitutional and will be replaced with the passage of Bill C-3; The remedies that the Complainants seek may not be possible; Registration under the Indian Act may not constitute a service under the Canadian Human Rights Act; The Respondent currently anticipates that the hearing of this matter, as it relates to those provisions that were found unconstitutional and will be replaced with the passage of Bill C-3, will take several weeks given the volume of materials anticipated to be disclosed and the historical nature that such a defence might take; and In order to ensure that the Complaints are properly addressed, and that time before the Tribunal is used most appropriately, the Complaints should be adjourned sine die, or alternatively to January 31, 2011, to allow for the passage of Bill C-3 currently before the House of Commons.\n[14] The Complainants\u2019 submissions, in summary, are as follows:\nThe Complainants understand that the OIR cannot register them under the current Indian Act. The Complainants are not seeking a review of the OIR\u2019s policies or of its registration protocol; they are asking the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to review s. 6 of the Indian Act to make a determination as whether it infringes the Complainants\u2019 human rights as determined by the CHRA; The Tribunal should not allow any further delay of its process based on what may or may not happen with Bill C-3 in the House of Commons. The Tribunal must operate on complaints before it, based on law and statutes that are currently in place; It is the Complainants position that Bill C-3, as currently before the House of Commons, will not resolve the substance of their complaints in their entirety; A further delay of a determination of the matter will continue to prejudice the Complainants, most notably, by continuing to prevent them from a potential right to recognize an ethnic identity that they have been denied for their lifetime; The Respondent\u2019s argument alluding to cost effectiveness should not be given weight against continuing substantive human rights violations experienced by the Complainants. The Complainants are not concerned with the length of the potential hearing and submit that the Respondent has had ample time to prepare; and Although the facts and issues of the Complainants\u2019 case are similar to the McIvor case, they are nonetheless distinct claims that are being pursued in different forums; each having its own considerations, policies and procedures that ought to be followed and enforced.\n[15] The Commission\u2019s submissions, in summary, are as follows:\nThe Commission opposes the current request to adjourn these proceedings sine die or to January 31, 2011. Instead, the Commission asks that the Tribunal put in place a schedule to deal with the Respondent\u2019s preliminary argument that the government does not provide a service under the CHRA when deciding the eligibility for registration under the Indian Act. This approach is to be preferred according to the Commission because: it avoids prolonging the hearing process through a series of lengthy adjournments; nothing in the draft legislation that is currently before Parliament would affect the evidence or arguments that are required to resolve the services question; and it promotes efficiency by focusing on a discrete preliminary jurisdictional matter that has the potential to finally determine the complaints.\n[16] It is clearly very frustrating and disappointing for the Complainants to have their Complaints delayed while the Court of Appeal of British Columbia in McIvor waits for the Parliament of Canada to legislate in response to its findings that parts of s. 6 of the Indian Act are of no force and effect on constitutional grounds.\n[17] The McIvor decision by the Court of Appeal of British Columbia to not issue a declaration that would put its findings respecting the validity of parts of s. 6 of the Indian Act into effect to allow the Parliament of Canada to provide remedial legislation, means that currently s. 6 is technically still fully in effect but, practically speaking, is of doubtful validity upon which to base any decision by this Tribunal at the present time. This is particularly so in view of the fact that the House of Commons has introduced and given two readings to Bill C-3.\n[18] It is certainly a goal and objective of the Tribunal to provide expeditious resolutions to complaints brought before it and to avoid unnecessary and undue delays that have the impact of conceivably denying justice. That goal and objective, however, must be balanced against the equally important objective and goal of the Tribunal to ensure that its decisions are just and meaningful not simply swift.\n[19] The parties all acknowledge that currently s. 6 of the Indian Act does not provide the OIR with authority to register an individual where the individual does not meet the legal requirements for registration as an Indian under s. 6 as the OIR does not have discretion when determining whether or not an individual has met these requirements. Etches v. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 ONCA 182\n[20] However flawed, in the view of the Complainants and the Commission, that Bill C-3's current language is in effecting for the Complainants the remedies sought by them, the House of Commons has acted in response to McIvor by introducing and giving two readings to Bill C-3. The result of what Bill C-3 will eventually accomplish is unknown at this point and it is purely speculative to make predictions about its final language.\n[21] The Complainants and the Commission both are of the view that the Tribunal, as a result of the delay of the House of Commons in legislating in response to McIvor and the uncertainty of the current language of the proposed remedial legislation now before the House, should make a determination now based on the current state of s. 6 of the Indian Act, in spite of the fact that the Court of Appeal of British Columbia has determined in McIvor that it is of no force and effect, subject to the temporary suspension of its declaration.\n[22] As much as I favour an expeditious process in this matter and am disappointed by the failure of the Parliament to enact remedial legislation, I can see neither any real value or advantage, from a practical point of view of scheduling a hearing, as requested by the Commission, under current circumstances, into whether under s. 5 of the CHRA there is a service in registration under s. 6 of the Indian Act when s. 6 has been found itself to be of no force and effect by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in McIvor and the current law does not allow for registration of the Complainants. While such a hearing may give the impression or appearance that matters are moving forward, in reality, such a hearing based on legislation, already determined to be invalid, is not, in my opinion appropriate or actually helpful to anyone.\n[23] In the result, for the foregoing reasons, I will grant the request of the Respondent for an adjournment until January 31, 2011 and we will see what the Court of Appeal of British Columbia or Parliament will do next.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Additional disclosure.\nB. Addition of Witnesses:\nA. Additional disclosure [1] The issues raised in this case are related to fundamental human rights. The rules of natural justice require that both parties be able to bring forward their evidence that sustain their positions. However, this does not permit the parties to dispute all collateral assertions made in a hearing. The Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure are more relaxed than a court proceeding, however the Tribunal\u2019s rules are intended to ensure that parties are not surprised by last minute disclosure. Rules 6 and 9 require the disclosure of all arguably relevant evidence:\n6 Statement Of Particulars, Disclosure, Production\nStatement of Particulars\n6(1) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve and file a Statement of Particulars setting out,\nthe material facts that the party seeks to prove in support of its case; its position on the legal issues raised by the case; the relief that it seeks; a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which no privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue, or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule; a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, for which privilege is claimed, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule; a list identifying all witnesses the party intends to call, other than expert witnesses, together with a summary of the anticipated testimony of each witness.\nReply\n6(2) The complainant and the Commission shall serve and file a Reply within the time fixed by the Panel,\nwhere they intend to prove facts or raise issues to refute the respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars; and where these facts or issues were not identified in their Statement of Particulars under 6(1).[14]\nExpert witness reports and reports in response\n6(3) Within the time fixed by the Panel, each party shall serve on all other parties and file with the Tribunal,\n(a) a report in respect of any expert witness the party intends to call, which report shall,\nbe signed by the expert; set out the expert\u2019s name, address and qualifications; and set out the substance of the expert\u2019s proposed testimony; and[21]\n(b) a report in respect of any expert witness the party intends to call in response to an expert\u2019s report filed under 6(3)(a), which report shall comply with the requirements of 6(3)(a).\nProduction of documents\n6(4) Where a party has identified a document under 6(1)(d), it shall provide a copy of the document to all other parties. It shall not file the document with the Registry.\nOngoing disclosure and production\n6(5) A party shall provide such additional disclosure and production as is necessary\nwhere new facts, issues or forms of relief are raised by another party\u2019s Statement of Particulars or Reply; or where the party discovers that its compliance with 6(1)(d), 6(1)(e), 6(1)(f), 6(3) or 6(4) is inaccurate or incomplete.\n9 Hearing, Evidence\nNo previously undisclosed evidence, issue, relief\n9(3) Except with leave of the Panel, which leave shall be granted on such terms and conditions as accord with the purposes set out in 1(1), and subject to a party\u2019s right to lead evidence in reply,\na party who does not raise an issue under Rule 6 shall not raise that issue at the hearing; a party who does not, under Rule 6, identify a witness or provide a summary of his or her anticipated testimony shall not call that witness at the hearing; a party who does not disclose and produce a document under Rule 6 shall not introduce that document into evidence at the hearing; a party who does not, under Rule 6, identify the relief which it seeks shall not make representations in respect of that relief at the hearing; and a party who has not complied with 6(3) shall not introduce an expert report into evidence nor call an expert witness at the hearing.\n[2] Specifically, rule 9(3) creates a presumption of inadmissibility of undisclosed evidence. With the panel\u2019s permission, parties can bring forth new elements, however, it must be expected that last minute disclosure will have certain disadvantages. If last minute disclosure is permitted, the other party must be permitted to sufficiently prepare itself in order to respect the principles of natural justice. The party that disclosed last minute evidence shall bear some of the disadvantages.\n[3] On November 1, 2010, exhibit C-1, tab 18 was put to the Complainant-witness but was not entered into evidence as an objection was raised. The Respondent\u2019s counsel indicated to the panel that this document, a job posting and resume, had been disclosed to them only that morning and as such, they had not had an opportunity to review it. The panel ruled that the Respondent\u2019s counsel should take this opportunity and examine the document overnight in order to cure the prejudice and prepare accordingly. The next day, the Respondent\u2019s counsel presented the Complainant\u2019s counsel with a series of documents which had not been previously disclosed and which have not been entered in evidence. The Complainant\u2019s counsel was awarded time to review the documents before commenting on his position with regards to them. After his review, the Complainant\u2019s counsel requested to view the original of the pre-screening matrix, which was granted. A request was also made to discuss these new documents with the Complainant-witness who is currently still under oath, her examination in chief not yet completed.\n[4] After consideration of the parties\u2019 submissions and the rule of fairness, the Complainant-witness shall not be given the opportunity to review the documents beforehand. Should the Respondent\u2019s counsel wish to enter these documents into evidence, they may do so and put the documents, including the pre-screening matrix to the witness at that time and allow her sufficient time to review the documents on the stand.\nB. Addition of Witnesses: [5] The Respondent\u2019s counsel raised the issue of the Complainant-witness testifying that she got along well with her coworkers. Counsel indicated that this evidence took him by surprise as the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars did not specify that she would contest the validity of her performance appraisals. The Complainant\u2019s counsel responded citing the following paragraphs from the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars:\nPar. 4: The complainant was a good, competent, loyal and hardworking employee.\nPar. 21: In this regard, the complainant says that insofar as the negative comments and criticisms in 2005 and 2006 performance appraisals are accurate, such comments and criticisms are directly attributable to symptoms of the complainant\u2019s diabetes.\nPar. 31: The respondent gave the complainant poor performance appraisals in 2005 and 2006. The main criticisms in these performance appraisals pertained to attitude\/personality issues and work ethic\/workload issues. The core ability of the complainant to do her job was not specifically criticised. While the complainant did not accept the validity of all of the criticisms in her report, at the time they were levelled, the complainant acknowledges that insofar as the criticisms are valid they related to how she was feeling in 2005 and 2006.\n[6] Although it may not appear at first glance that the Complainant-witness would contest the validity of her performance appraisals, this fact could have been inferred from these paragraphs.\n[7] The Respondent\u2019s counsel states that they advised the Complainant\u2019s counsel of their intentions to potentially call additional witnesses, but the panel notes that this letter was received, as stated by the Complainant\u2019s counsel, on the Friday prior to the beginning of the hearing.\n[8] The fact that the Complainant-witness testified that she got along well with her coworkers could be questioned depending on what would be submitted by the Respondent\u2019s counsel as a will say. The Complainant\u2019s counsel also mentioned that if these additional witnesses were allowed, he would have to re-evaluate his case and possibly present new evidence and call other witnesses, which would be prejudicial to the process.\n[9] Both parties may request to add witnesses subject to the submission of precise will-says, including clear statements on issues to be addressed in testimony, relevance to the case and an estimate of the time required for testimony. They should not be redundant and should not distract from the issue at hand. These will-says will be reviewed by the panel and it will then determine if the witnesses may testify. The panel will consider the relevance of the content of the will says and the impact on the entire process before granting the additions. If the witnesses are added to the witness list, the panel expects full disclosure of any supporting documentation for these witnesses prior to the hearing.\n[10] The panel has given careful consideration to the nature of the evidence in question, the objections to its admissibility, the relevance of the evidence and the potential unreliability or prejudice suggested by the objections.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon Tribunal Member\nWinnipeg, Manitoba November 3, 2010\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1452\/7809\nStyle of Cause: Heather Lynn Grant v.

INTRODUCTION: [1] The Complainant, born June 29, 1944, claims to have worked for the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) for around 20 years, in Canada and abroad. During this time, she provided administrative support to senior-level government employees. At one point during this period, from 1989 to 1995, she had to take disability leave due to fibromyalgia.\n[2] On January 5, 2001, the Complainant asked for a transfer from the DFAIT to the International Programs Unit, which was part of the Learning, Assessment and Executive Programs Branch (LAEPB) of the Canada Public Service Commission, where she was a Portfolio Coordinator, a clerical position classified at the CR-5 group and level.\n[3] Since its structure had not changed since 1918, the Public Service Commission made many modifications to it in 2003 without reducing its staff. Furthermore, it made sure changes were made in accordance with the recommendations made by the Task Force on Modernizing Human Resources Management in the Public Service and taking into account legislative changes as established in Bill C-25.\n[4] Two of these changes were made to the LAEPB and had significant consequences for the Complainant: first they led to the closing of the International Programs Unit on June 30, 2003, where the Complainant worked. This automatically led to the elimination of 11 positions, including the Complainant's position.\n[5] Secondly, on October 31, 2003, senior executives also closed the rest of the LAEPB, which had been renamed the Learning and Development Programs Branch, to which the Complainant had been transferred. This second closing led to the elimination of 10 other positions. Once again, the Complainant's position was eliminated. She found herself without a specific assignment.\n[6] In the next while, until the beginning of 2005, the Complainant, who held the affected employee status, held various positions at the Public Service Commission, sometimes with written assignments, sometimes without; she also spent several months on disability leave during this period. On January 13, 2005, deciding her situation was intolerable, the Complainant resigned from the Public Service and retired.\n[7] On February 28, 2006, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against the Respondent, her former employer, the Public Service Commission. She claims that the Respondent discriminated against her based on her age and her disability, which is in contravention of sections 7 (Employment) and 10 (Discriminatory policy or practice) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act).\n[8] She alleges that her health deteriorated primarily as a result of the behaviour of the Respondent's representatives. For these reasons, she felt forced to resign. Her early retirement prevented her from working another five years and being able to add five years worth of contributions to her pension plan, which went against her career plan. She claims that she planned to work until the age of 65. The consequences of her premature retirement were very damaging both economically and health-wise. As a result, she is claiming compensation for the damages incurred.\nA. THE COMPLAINANT IS SELF-REPRESENTED [9] The Complainant, at the start of the hearing on September 14, 2009, through a preliminary motion, verbally asked the Chairperson of the Tribunal for permission to schedule the hearing for a later date because she needed more time to get new counsel and better prepare herself.\n[10] She then told the Tribunal that when she filed her complaint, she had access to counsel that her union had offered to pay for.\n[11] She then consulted a non-lawyer who offered to represent her on the condition that she waive doing business with the union-provided counsel. The Complainant preferred this advice and decided to take on the file with this individual's assistance without the presence of the union's counsel.\n[12] Finally, the Complainant informed the Tribunal at the beginning of June 2009, a few days before the scheduled start of the hearing at the end of June and beginning of July, that the advisor who agreed to help her with her file decided for medical reasons to cease representing her.\n[13] It was agreed upon with the Tribunal that the hearing scheduled for the end of June and beginning of July 2009, would be rescheduled for the week of September 14 to 18, 2009, to give the Complainant time to get new counsel and prepare herself.\n[14] However, to justify the motion for an extension, although the initial application in June set forth only one reason, being the health of the advisor that would not allow her to proceed, she added a second reason: there was a disagreement between herself and the representative in how to proceed with the file. It is for these two reasons that she decided to go ahead without the advisor's services.\n[15] To support the second application for postponement, she specified that she was so sick during the summer of 2009, that she could not take care of the file in the manner she would have liked and to this day, she could not find counsel who would agree to represent her on a contingency basis.\n[16] The Tribunal, pursuant to the stipulations of section 48.9 of the Act, which says that the proceedings before the Tribunal shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirement of natural justice and rules of procedure allow, found that the additional 2.5 month extension gave the Complainant sufficient time to prepare and find new counsel and respected the principle of natural justice. It therefore ordered to proceed with the hearing without further delay.\n[17] To facilitate comprehension of this judgment, we have decided to start by setting out in section II the facts and allegations that gave rise to the Complainant's complaint while respecting the chronology of the events. Then, in section III, we will analyze the Complainant's other facts and allegation that we were unable to include in this chronology, as they are facts of a prolonged and continued nature. We will then focus, in section IV on the legal criteria applicable and then in section V, we will analyze the issues in dispute, finishing with section VI, which contains our observations on the appropriate remedy applicable to this file.\nII. CHRONOLOGICAL OUTLINE OF FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE COMPLAINT A. Closing of the International Programs Unit [18] At the beginning of January 2003, the then Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch, met with the employees of the International Programs Unit, which was a part of her Branch, including the Complainant, to inform them that, as a result of the restructuring of the Public Service Commission, their unit would be closing on June 30.\n[19] She assured them that following this reorganization, no one would lose their job and the Human Resources Office, then represented by its director, would handle their situation by assisting them in the process of finding a new position within the same group at the same level.\n[20] In March of 2003, the Complainant started working for the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch in an administrative support role. When she was replaced on April 1, 2003, the new Deputy Chairperson invited the Complainant to continue working for him as a correspondence assistant; she continued to provide administrative support for the Director of Special Projects.\n[21] According to the Complainant, of the 11 people who worked at the Branch, some took the opportunity to retire and others, who were much younger than her, as she was 59 years old at the time, found a job before the end of June, 2003, except her.\n[22] According to the Respondent's witnesses, the version is a little different. They claim that it was also the Complainant's case and that she continued to benefit from the affected employee status.\nB. Closing of the Learning and Development Programs Branch [23] The senior executives of the Public Service Commission also decided to close what was left of the Learning and Development Programs Branch on October 31, 2003. The Complainant was part of this Branch, which was only made up of 11 people.\n[24] According to the Complainant, some of these people took the opportunity to retire while others, who were much younger than the Complainant, then 59 years of age, found another job. Only the Complainant could not find a job.\n[25] Again, the version of the Respondent's witnesses is slightly different. They claim that the Complainant continued to be employed by the Public Service Commission and that she continued to take advantage of her affected employee status.\nC. Abandonment of Complainant for six weeks [26] The Complainant complained about being left alone for a 6-week period in a large, recently vacated space on the 21st floor of Esplanade Laurier, after the employees of the Learning and Development Programs Branch left. This situation lasted from the beginning of November until mid-December, 2003.\n[27] The Director of Human Resources recognized that his unit was supposed to take care of the people looking for work whose Unit or Branch had been removed, said that at the time, he was not aware of the 6-week period the Complainant alleged having spent alone on the 21st floor of Esplanade Laurier.\n[28] When questioned as to whether they frequently lost employees, he admitted that it was the first time, to his knowledge, that he had heard of this case and that he had never been confronted with a situation like this one before. Neither he nor the other Respondent's witnesses could shed any light on this situation.\n[29] The director of Human Resources added that the Complainant continued to receive a salary during that time, right until she retired. Two of the Respondent's witnesses, who had already left the office to work elsewhere at the time, were not in a position to comment on what occurred during this 6-week period.\nD. The Complainant becomes the administrative support for the Director of the Equity and Diversity Directorate [30] Following the Complainant's submissions to the Senior Strategic Advisor, a manager she knew, she explained the whole situation to him and asked him to help her find a new job. With his efforts, she quickly found short-term work with the Director of the Equity and Diversity Directorate, as an administrative assistant, where she started mid-December, 2003. It was, again, a temporary position.\nE. The Complainant's disability [31] On January 19, 2004, after having worked for the Senior Strategic Advisor for about a month, the Complainant became ill and went on disability leave. At the time, she was experiencing digestion and memory problems. According to the Complainant, these symptoms were caused primarily by her job and the worry that plagued her, as she was afraid of not having a job.\n[32] Though the Complainant claims her symptoms were primarily because of the problems she experienced at work, the Respondent's witnesses expressed the idea, during the hearing, in light of the Complainant's medical reports, that the Complainant's work was not the sole trigger for her health issues and; that problems of a personal nature could also cause a good portion of her health problems, as reported in the medical reports, particularly of her psychiatrist.\n[33] The Complainant's family doctor explained to the Tribunal that the stress experienced by the Complainant at work was not the cause of her depression but one of the major triggers for it.\n[34] This very same doctor wrote a note stating that the Complainant would be on disability from January 19 to March 1, 2004. The Complainant stressed that this notice did not state that she would be ready to go back to work on March 1 but that the medical situation would be reviewed at the end of that disability period and until then, she was on disability leave for an indeterminate period. Her family doctor confirmed this during his testimony.\nF. January 2004, Offer for Program Coordinator [35] The then Director of Executive Resourcing, who had a position to fill, informed Human Resources of his needs. The Complainant's appointment was suggested and he was informed of her precarious situation. They indicated that she should be strongly advised to accept the position offered as time could work against her. Given she had the affected employee status, she must fear being given surplus status. This meant that in the near future, she would become surplus and eventually laid-off. Human Resources sent the Complainant's C.V. to the Director of Executive Resourcing.\n[36] After examining the Complainant's C.V., the Director of Executive Resourcing consulted some people to get some references, including the then Director of Special Projects. The responses were sufficiently favourable for the Director to decide that the Complainant's application was adequate.\n[37] He called her January 20, 2004, to tell her that the position of Program Coordinator with Executive Resourcing Directorate, that he managed, was available and was being offered to her, and specified that it was a CR-5 position.\n[38] The Director of Executive Resourcing explained to the Tribunal that he had difficulty recruiting and keeping staff. This is why he took the time to speak to or phone potential candidates to promote himself by demonstrating enthusiasm in the obvious goal of making them want to work in his directorate. He did his best to motivate people, which is what he did during this phone call.\n[39] He therefore offered the Complainant the position of Program Coordinator that he described as being administrative but that was, in fact, according to the Complainant, nothing but a clerical position where she would have to work primarily on a computer about 7 hours a day and do copy\/paste type work.\n[40] The Complainant maintained that this position did not correspond in any way to her skills and qualifications, which were clearly outlined on her C.V., which the Director of Executive Resourcing had. Not to mention that this kind of work went against the note written by her family doctor in 2001 (see Exhibit R-1, tab 5) that was in her file and referred to her pre-existing condition of fibromyalgia. She reaffirmed her interest in an administrative position. Despite the Complainant's lukewarm reaction, the Director of Executive Resourcing continued to insist and attempted to reassure her with respect to her ability to do the job.\n[41] He painted her a picture of the tasks associated with the position offered, tried to reassure her by telling her that even if she did not have experience with this kind of work, they could give her training. He did his best to make her feel like she was welcome in his Directorate.\n[42] The Director of Executive Resourcing also suggested, in a manner interpreted as menacing by the Complainant, that if she did not accept the position being offered, there could be unpleasant consequences for her: that she may be put on a priority list and after a year, she would be unemployed. He ended the telephone call by asking her to seriously consider his offer and that he would call her back in two weeks.\n[43] For his part, the Director of Executive Resourcing, explained that it was not until he sensed the Complainant was going to refuse his offer that he risked tell her about the consequences of her refusal. He told her about the situation as explained to him by Human Resources. He estimated that it was in the best interest of the Complainant that she be informed of the danger of her situation.\n[44] The Complainant, over the course of the telephone call, explained him that she was very sick and unable to return to work at that time and could not give him an approximate date of return. She alleges also having discussed her fibromyalgia problem with him and her worries about a relapse resulting from the type of work proposed for a person with her specific condition.\n[45] Also, according to the Complainant, even though she was very sick, she took notes about the telephone call as accurately as possible. She transcribed them immediately after.\n[46] The Director of Executive Resourcing claimed that at no time during the telephone call did the Complainant mention to him that she would need to make specific arrangements as a result of her particular medical condition; never did she refer to her issues in terms of fibromyalgia. He added that at no time, even after this conversation, did the Complainant and he discussed her needs in the matter.\n[47] He specified that he himself had worked in a Human Resources department for several years and has been confronted numerous times with requests for accommodation from employees returning from long term disability leave. In these situations, he would start by asking the employee for a medical certificate, issued either from the employee's doctor or from the employer's doctor supporting the needs of the employee in terms of accommodation. Then, upon receiving the certificate, he would discuss with the employees how he could accommodate them. In his eyes, it goes without saying that you have to make things easier for the employee and have them come back in the best condition.\n[48] He added that if the Complainant had told him about her fibromyalgia, he would have taken that approach. He added that he never knew that she had a disability of any kind.\n[49] Despite the Complainant's reticence expressed during the January 20 phone call, on January 21, 2004, she signed the document R-2, tab 6 signed by the then Director General of Executive Resourcing, dated January 16, 2004, entitled Response to a letter of offer; this letter of appointment stated that she would come in to work on March 1, 2004.\n[50] The Complainant claims that two weeks later, at the beginning of February 2004, the Director of Executive Resourcing called her back, as promised. He insisted again that she accept his offer and provide him with a return to work date. She reiterated that she could not confirm the date for her return and the position offered was not suitable for a person with fibromyalgia and furthermore, she was not offered any accommodation. Here is an excerpt from this telephone conversation that the Complainant claims to have faithfully reproduced by typing out its contents immediately after hanging up. (C-1, Tab 58)\n... I told him that I still could not give him a date and re-stated that the job he was offering me did not accommodate my disability and that I had serious doubts about taking it. Mr ( ... ) repeated his threat of my taking a huge risk of landing up unemployed at the end of one year and landing up on the street. This time he scared me much that I told him that I would take his job offer but did not feel that I could not return to the work place until early March. Therefore, despite reports from 2 specialists (Drs X and Y) that stated that they did not feel that I was well enough to return and were even doubtful that I could so with a gradual return of one or two days a week, out of sheer terror of being unemployed, I went back and accepted (...)'s job offer and started work in his shop, still quite ill on March 8, 2004...\n(Emphasis added)\n[51] It is difficult to imagine this conversation that the Complainant alleges having had with the Director of Executive Resourcing in February 2004. How can she say, This time he scared me much that I told him that I would take his job offer when she had already signed the Response to a letter of offer on January 21?\nG. Ms. Gravel's return to work from March 8 to April 14, 2004 [52] On March 1, 2004, the Director of Executive Resourcing waited in vain for the Complainant to arrive at work. She did not show up for her new job until March 8, later claiming that she was still sick during the first week of March. She worked until April 14, 2004, and had to stop working due to illness. This was her last day of work. The disability period that followed would continue until her resignation and the beginning of her retirement at the start of 2005, supported by a series of reports and medical certificates.\n[53] During this short work period of March 8 to April 14, 2004, in the Director of Executive Resourcing's opinion, the quality of the Complainant's work left a lot to be desired. Her training period was difficult. She took a long time learning her position's tasks. The Complainant knew herself that her work was not satisfactory and that it was at her immediate superior's insistence that she came back to work, which was evidently too quickly.\nH. Complainant's long-term disability period [54] The complainant's family doctor wrote a note on May 20, 2004, in support of these facts, see Exhibit R-2, tab 7, indicating that his patient, the Complainant, would be completely disabled for the period from April 28, 2004, until September 3, 2004.\n[55] On June 10, her family doctor specified that his patient was in a state of severe depression and would not be back to work before September 3.\n[56] With the exception of the insurance company's psychiatrist, the three other doctors who examined the Complainant during the summer and\/or autumn months of 2004, all recognized that the Complainant's depression rendered her incapable of working.\n[57] In a letter dated October 15, 2004, exhibit R-1, tab 11, the insurance company accepted to pay the Complainant disability benefits from July 28 to October 31, 2004.\n[58] In a letter dated January 21, 2005, Exhibit R-1, tab 13, the insurance company agreed to pay the Complainant disability benefits from October 31, 2004, until March 31, 2005. Unfortunately, she had already resigned when the letter arrived.\n[59] At the beginning of September 2004, the Director of Executive Resourcing claims to have called the Complainant for an update. She told him that her doctors did not think she should go back to work.\nI. The Respondent, who was aware of the Complainant's depression, should have taken this into account and made the necessary adjustments when she asked to return to work on November 8, 2004. [60] The Complainant said that at the time, a change in her medication had a positive impact on her health and she felt well enough to think that November may mark a good time to slowly return to work even if the psychiatrist who was treating her did not share this opinion. During the trial, she said:\nDespite what Dr. ( ... ) had stated that she was not sure I could do part time, I, the one, knew how I felt and I felt much better that I contacted Mr. ( ... ) and asked him if I could do a gradual return to work.\n[61] Then, the Complainant alleges having called her immediate superior on November 8, 2004, and offered to come back to work gradually, offering at the start to work two days per week and later, moving up to five days a week. She offered to take the position of telephone operator currently occupied by a temporary employee and suggested to switch tasks with that employee so the receptionist could do her own tasks. He categorically refused this suggestion: No, no, absolutely not.\n[62] His reaction left her speechless, especially because in the time she worked for him, her impression of him was as follows: (excerpt from her notes taken following the telephone call of November 8, Exhibit C1- tab 57)\nN.B.: I am truly shocked at what Mr. ( ... ) said and at the harshness of his words and his tone because for the short period of time that I did work for him he was always soft spoken, always calm, prim and proper and always behaved in a professional manner. A very distinguished gentleman ...\n[63] When asked about the telephone call that the Complainant alleged she made to him on November 8, 2004, the Director of Executive Resourcing stated that he did not remember this at all. He went as far as saying that he had no recollection of the Complainant asking for accommodations, neither by phone nor any other means, not on that day, nor at any other time.\n[64] The medical evidence and the letters from the insurance company included in the file say that the Complainant was on total disability from April 14, 2004 until March 1, 2005.\n[65] The following excerpt, from the last paragraph of page 2 of Dr. ( ...)'s medical report, who assessed the patient in November 2004, at the request of her family doctor, (Exhibit R-1, tab 10), illustrates what the psychiatrist then thought about a possible gradual return to work by the Complainant:\n...I do not feel she can currently return to the workplace full-time and I am not at all optimistic that that will ever be achieved for her given both her age and her past history and her current mechanism of coping. I doubt even that she will manage a part-time reintegration into the workplace to give that a trial. It may be possible but I would start at a low level such as half a day a week.\n[66] As a result, the observation indicates that at the time when the psychiatrist met the Complainant in November 2004, she did not recommend a gradual return to work. She even raised doubts regarding the Complainant's eventual return to work.\nJ. Last day of work, Complainant's letter of resignation [67] In fact, the Complainant worked until mid-April 2004 and was still on disability the day she decided to resign and retire in January 2005.\n[68] On January 10, 2005, the Complainant sent her immediate superior a resignation letter (R-1, tab 12) informing him that she was retiring on January 13. In this letter, the Complainant blames the insurance company that, by depriving her of an income and refusing to assume the cost of the treatment that would have given her the opportunity to return to work in December 2004, as recommended by her doctor, she felt obliged to resign and retire as soon as possible.\n[69] The reasons given by the Complainant to justify her decision to resign do not mention the role played by the Respondent in this case and do not cover any allegations against her immediate superior. Questioned on the absence of allegations against to the Respondent's representatives, she said it was a diplomatic gesture and she wanted to leave on good terms; that she was a diplomat in this world that ignored diplomacy altogether.\n[70] Here is the response to the resignation letter, written by her boss, as a handwritten letter attached to the Complainant's letter:\nAnn\nI assume you mean January 13, 2005. If it is, I concur with your retirement at the end of the business day January 13, 2005. I wish you all the best and I thank you for your continued dedication.\n( ... ) (signature) 01.01.12\n[71] On February 28, 2006, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\nIII. COMPLAINANT'S OTHER FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS A. Human Resources did nothing to help the Complainant [72] The Complainant claims that Human Resources did nothing to find her a job. The following is the reaction of the Respondent's witnesses to that reproach.\n[73] According to the Respondent's witnesses, all the necessary measures were taken to help the Complainant find a new job.\n[74] The Director of Human Resources for the Public Service Commission, who was very familiar with the Complainant's situation, explained how Human Resources worked.\n[75] Pursuant to the rules established for the reassignment of personnel affected by unit closures, an attempt to find a job within the work unit is the first step; then, if no position is available, there is an attempt to place the employee in the same position and level within the Directorate, then within the Department, then outside the Department; the witness said that to understand this approach, you just need to imagine [TRANSLATION] concentric circles; the smallest circle representing the employee's unit of work, the next circle representing the directorate, then the Department, and finally, the last circle is outside the department. This approach is designed to have as little impact as possible on the employee and is less traumatizing for the employees involved.\n[76] The witness added that the Complainant was considered a CR-5 and that there were always many positions at this level to fill, that each year, there were 10 to 12 positions that became available. In his opinion, he was not remotely concerned that it would have been simple at any point to find the Complainant a job.\n[77] However, Human Resources did not take any proactive or specific measures: they let the Complainant search for herself. She had expressed a preference for an administrative position when she met with the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch in January 2003 and later, during a second interview with the chief of Human Resources, as such a position would better suit her qualifications and experience. While waiting to find what she was looking for, she continued to be paid and to work; there was therefore no great urgency to move things forward.\n[78] The witness told the Tribunal that by giving the Complainant time and by not pressuring her, she would have the opportunity to find a job that would suit her.\n[79] According to the person who replaced the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch, it takes a minimum of six months before an employee, who submits an application for employment and attends an interview, can obtain the results. The Respondent's responsibility consisted of helping employees affected by the unit closure in finding a job at the same group and level and not finding them a job at a higher level. However, the Complainant demonstrated an interest in administrative level work, which she considered more suitable based on her experience and qualifications when, in fact, this meant that she was interested in a job at a higher level.\n[80] He took measures to have someone train her in financial matters; however, the Complainant complained that this training was insufficient given the lack of availability of trainers.\n[81] Two people gave reference letters to the Complainant.\n[82] According to the Director of Human Resources, the Complainant's name was put on a priority list by Human Resources and internal managers were informed of her availability.\n[83] The Complainant continued to work for the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch, until the branch closed at the end of October 2003. Before leaving, on September 30, 2003, he signed an assignment agreement covering the Complainant from September 1 until December 31, 2003.\n[84] The Director of Human Resources stated that, following the closure of the Learning and Development Programs Branch at the end of October 2003, Human Resources took the same approach as when the International Program Unit closed with respect to helping employees who lost their jobs; they left the employees to take the necessary steps to find a new job. This was also the case for the Complainant until the end of 2003.\n[85] Some further clarification by a witness, who retired in 2008, after 37 years in the public service, who was the Deputy Chairperson of the Corporate Management Branch, was provided during the hearing. He explained the approach the Public Service Commission took and that it promoted to transform and modernize the PSC and specified that he used this approach in the Complainant's case.\n[86] At the time that the PSC was being reorganized, this person had approximately 1,400 employees. With his team, he proceeded with the writing of the two following documents: PSC Transformation Realigning for Modernization - Backgrounder Exhibit R-1, tab 2 and PSC Transformation Realigning for Modernization - Questions & Answers Exhibit R-1, tab 2.\n[87] The second document, which had: Prepared by the Transformation Secretariat, February 18, 2003 on the front page, was distributed to all PSC employees; the Complainant would have received a copy.\n[88] It was clear for all those involved that the public service modernization would not reduce the staff in place. This is the reassurance that was sent to everyone. Here is a relevant excerpt from page 10 of the Questions and Answers (Exhibit R-1, tab 5):\nQ. Will all PSC staff have jobs after the April 1 reorganization?\nA. The April 1 reorganization is not a job reduction exercise. In the unforeseen circumstance of reductions, we will identify opportunities for employment elsewhere in the PSC, opportunities for retraining, as well as provide employee assistance and career counselling. In some cases, we may also look to other departments. Although it is not anticipated, if it becomes necessary, the Treasury Board Workforce Adjustment Directives will apply....\n[89] Given the concerns raised by the Complainant, who claimed she went a long time before finally receiving a Written Assignment Agreement, the Director of Human Resources was invited to shed some light on the subject.\n[90] He said that a written assignment specifically had an administrative advantage in determining who from the Home Organization or the Host Organization or from Corporate Reserve would pay the employee. He then specified that the Complainant continued to be paid even when she did not have a written assignment agreement. In fact, it is sufficient for there to be a verbal agreement between the employee and the managers of the Home Organization and the Host Organization.\n[91] The Director of Executive Resourcing explained that the absence of a Written Assignment Agreement was normal and that it was common practice to give employees non-written assignments. He specified that managers sometimes signed written assignments to reassure worried employees or if there was mistrust between managers.\n[92] It became clear during the hearing that Complainant had a written assignment agreement from April 1 to June 30, 2003 and from September 1 to December 31, 2003.\n[93] When asked about how employees found new job, the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch said there were three ways:\nThe block transfer of a group of people and their functions; this was the case for employees of Language Training Canada, that after being part of the Learning Programs Branch were transferred as a block elsewhere in the Public Service. Employees who found work using their own resources; this was the case for the staff of the International Programs Unit, except Ms. Gravel. Not much help was given these people. Employees incapable of finding a job using their own means, like Ms. Gravel, who, consequently, needed more support.\n[94] He explained that he did for Ms. Gravel what he usually did for employees in the last category. In addition to still receiving a salary, he gave her less work to give her the opportunity to put more time and energy into finding a new job; he gave her access to a closed office with a telephone and a computer with e-mail access. He gave her a letter of reference (Exhibit R-1, tab 3). No pressure was put on the Complainant; he said he was aware that when applying for a competition, the process could take up to six months.\n[95] In fact, the Complainant applied to three competitions; unfortunately, she did not get a job through these competitions.\n[96] The witness said he was not in a position to say how much time the Complainant had to find a new job. This issue was never raised before he left the Corporate Management Branch at the end of October 2003. He added that a period of one year or more would be normal.\n[97] There was no financial pressure on the Complainant or the Branch as her salary was covered by Corporate Reserve.\n[98] When asked about the age of the Complainant, he answered that this issue had no bearing for him. In any case, he did not know the Complainant's age. Sometimes he learned an employee's age; as an engineer, he signed the passport forms of some employees who requested it but this was not the Complainant's case.\n[99] When asked about his relationship with Complainant, he answered that their work relationship was pleasant but infrequent in the 5 months that they worked in the same office. When asked about her performance, he said that the work requested was well done and he did not notice that she may be disabled in any way. He never received a request for accommodation from her. He never had to consult the Complainant's personal file and obviously, did not know about the medical certificate issued in 2001 that was in her file that described the Complainant's fibromyalgia. He specified that it was not current practice for managers to consults employees' personal files.\n[100] However, at the beginning of 2004, given it Complainant's fate had not yet been sealed and that she still had not managed to find a permanent position using her own means, the Human Resources Office decided to take matters into its own hands. It was even considering the Complainant a surplus employee as of March 2004.\nB. No one at Human Resources answered the Complainant's messages [101] The Complainant repeated several times and discussed the many ways she regularly contacted the Human Resources office to get its director's help, by leaving him phone messages, sometimes daily, and e-mails to his attention but no one ever followed up.\n[102] She claimed that she went in person to the Human Resources Office and asked for help. She was told that the Director would call her back.\n[103] When the Director of Human Resources was asked about the Complainant's accusation, he categorically denied having received any messages from the Complainant that he did not follow up on. He specified that this accusation did not make any sense and that, in the event that he could not respond, he would have delegated this responsibility and asked an employee to follow up.\nC. Unfair treatment [104] The Complainant claims that other employees, who are younger than her, got a new job and received better treatment than she did.\n[105] The Tribunal recognizes that the evidence collected did not give her the opportunity to learn that exact status of other employees of the International Programs Unit: did they have the status of affected employee, were they working with a written assignment agreement in hand or without assignment, no evidence was filed in this regard.\n[106] The only confirmation we have is from the Director of Human Resources who said that to his knowledge, most found a job using their own means.\n[107] Despite the confirmations made by the employer regarding the ages of other employees in this unit, it appears that each employee, except those who resigned to retire, were younger than the Complainant most of which were significantly younger than the Complainant.\nD. Human Resources ignored the Complainant's experience, qualifications and interests [108] The Complainant tried to demonstrate her qualifications and her experience, as outlined in her Curriculum Vitae, and claimed that Human Resources did nothing to find her a job suitable to her skills.\n[109] She presented the Tribunal with letters of recommendation in support of this and filed them with the Tribunal file; the letters said her work was generally appreciated by all. She repeated several times that she was proud of her accomplishments.\n[110] She recognized that her work left a little to be desired, but only for a short period of time, between 4 and 5 weeks, from March 8, 2004; she justified this by claiming that, following a disability leave from January 19 to March 8, 2004, with pressure from her immediate superior, she came back to work too quickly and additionally, as the position of Program Coordinator was new for her, she needed training, which was not carried out to her satisfaction due to the lack of trainers.\n[111] She had a civil servant now retired testify. He told the Tribunal that he had known the Complainant at DFAIT since 2000. He specified that she replaced his administrative assistant and that he was so completely satisfied with her services that when he was transferred to the International Programs Unit in 2001, he asked the Complainant to come with him, which she did. During the time he worked with her, he never heard anyone complain about the Complainant or heard anyone say she was dishonest.\n[112] In the 4 to 5 week period that the Complainant spent in his branch between March 8 and April 14, 2004, the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch maintains that she was very pleasant, even when he made recommendations, she was respectful, positive, smiled often, offered to help, even offered to be his assistant; he said he could not follow up on this request as other arrangements had been made within the organization.\n[113] The Respondent's witnesses, the Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch, the Director of Human Resources and the Director of Executive Resourcing were of the same opinion: the Complainant was looking for an administrative not clerical-level position, which she estimated as matching her experience and qualifications. The Complainant herself said so several times.\n[114] But, according to these witnesses, the Complainant was looking for the equivalent to a promotion when the rules adopted as part of the Public Service modernization provide for the transfer of employees to the same group and level. The Complainant had a CR-5 classification: a clerical level.\nE. The Respondent was aware of the Complainant's fibromyalgia and refused to make the appropriate accommodations [115] The Director of Special Projects at the time testified to the effect that in 2001, his immediate supervisor at the time, asked him to include in the Complainant's file a note from the Complainant's family doctor, dated June 2001, referring to her fibromyalgia. He also remembers, after producing this note, his boss changed the Complainant's work task, keeping in mind her fibromyalgia, which gave her less data entry and more secretarial-type work.\n[116] When questioned whether he had ever had to deal with a request for accommodation from an employee with some kind of disability, he answered affirmatively, specifying that it had occurred several times. However, he also specified that it is not enough to be aware of your staff and observe them; the employee has to talk to his or her supervisor to let this person know what he or she needs in terms of accommodations.\n[117] The Complainant maintains that the Director of Executive Resourcing, who was aware of her fibromyalgia, refused to take this into consideration when he gave her the position of Program Coordinator. However, this position required a lot of typing, which was not suitable for a person like her who has fibromyalgia.\n[118] She alleges having informed the Director of Executive Resourcing during their phone conversation in January 2004, that there was a certificate in her personal file, written by her family doctor in 2001, describing her fibromyalgia. She alleges having spoken to him about the disability during their phone conversations in January and February 2004.\n[119] The latter denies having been told by the Complainant about her fibromyalgia.\nF. The executive assistant position should have been offered to the Complainant instead of Ms. C.J. [120] The Complainant claims she was not offered the position of Executive Assistant for the Deputy Chairperson of the LAEPB, as it was given to Ms. C.J. She specified that Ms. C.J. was younger than her. She was around 28 years old at the time and the Complainant was 59.\n[121] Faced with this claim, the Deputy Chairperson specified that he knew Ms. C.J. better than he knew the Complainant, having seen her work for a longer period of time. In the 5 months that he spent at the LAEPB, he was in daily contact with Ms. C.J.\n[122] Because of her frequent absences from the office, he met the Complainant less often. He remembered her as a pleasant person who always did her work.\n[123] He found that the Complainant's work experience, which was mainly in Foreign Affairs, was less useful to the Public Service Commission, which had almost eliminated its involvement in international programs.\n[124] He remembered the Deputy Chairperson who brought Ms. C.J. to work in her branch as an acting CR-4. In February 2003, shortly before he arrived, she appointed Ms. C.J. to an acting AS-5 position for a year.\n[125] In the five months he spent in the LAEPB as Vice-Chairperson, Ms. C.J. handled his work life and did an excellent job.\n[126] In July 2003, he offered Ms. C.J. an acting AS-02 for a few months and she accepted. She carried out the duties of the position since she had started working for the previous Deputy Chairperson, without being entirely recognized for it.\n[127] As it was only a temporary position, given the LAEPB was about to close, and the position was going to disappear, he decided to offer it to Ms. C.J. without a competitive process, as is generally the practice in such circumstances. However, he opted for a three-week appeal period, even though he could have opted for a shorter one. Neither the Complainant nor anyone else appealed.\n[128] The AS-2 position was given to Ms. C.J., while the Complainant held a CR-5; going from a CR-5 to an AS-2 represented a promotion. The modernization commitments made by the PSC limited them to replacing employees at the same group and level.\n[129] The Respondent, though the Complainant was considered a priority, was not obliged to offer the position to the Complainant as it was at a higher level than a CR-5. When questioned about whether the Complainant showed an interest in the position given to Ms. C.J., the Deputy Chairperson indicated that the response was not clear but he remembered that she would have liked to follow him to his new office at Industry Canada. He could not specify if she expressed this wish explicitly or not.\n[130] Finally, the Tribunal did not see any documents nor hear any witnesses that could have shown that the Complainant requested the position occupied by Ms. C.J. The same is true for the position that Ms. C.J. would have at Industry Canada.\n[131] Asked about Ms. C.J.'s transfer to Industry Canada, the Deputy Chairperson specified that when he got to Industry Canada in September 2003, he decided to observe the office and analyze the situation before deciding on the kind of personnel he would need.\n[132] He became aware that he would need an assistant who was a tough fighter with a business background; the office was difficult and conflicts occurred often. He felt that Ms. C.J. had the necessary qualities for this position. Until then he made no promises with respect to this. It was not until after his evaluation and he had left for Industry Canada that he offered the job to Ms. C.J.\n[133] Following the explanations provided by the Deputy Chairperson, the Complainant added a comment; she was not testifying but completing her cross-examination:\nI would like to agree with your statement, now that you said the job was like at Industry Canada, knowing (C.J.) I agree with you completely.\n[134] Pursuant to the powers conferred on the member conducting the inquiry by paragraph 50(3)(c) of the Act, I admit into evidence the Complainant's comment, which to me means that the Complainant confirmed that Ms. C.J. seemed to be the better candidate for the position.\n[135] It would be helpful at this point to repeat the explanation already made by the Director of Human Resources regarding the concentric approach outlined in the rules that apply to the Public Service Commission to replace staff. The first effort is to place the employee in the same unit, then in the same branch, then within the department and finally, outside the department.\n[136] The position filled by Ms. C.J. at Industry Canada was open outside the department. As a result, it would have been premature of the Complainant to claim the right to a position at Industry Canada. Moreover, the position in question would have represented a promotion in her case.\nG. The Respondent is responsible for falsely spreading the news of her retirement [137] The Complainant claimed that the Director of Executive Resourcing sent the Director of Human Resources an e-mail on May 13, 2004, produced as Exhibit C-1 (6) containing false information; here is an excerpt of the text that is false:\n[TRANSLATION]\nShe says she would like to retire when she turns 60 on June 29, 2004, buy 10 years of service and not return to work thereafter.\n[138] The Complainant specified that she did not provide this information to the Director of Executive Resourcing as at the time, she had not yet decided to resign.\n[139] The Complainant also had a Pay and Benefits Officer, testify; she came to explain that the Complainant asked her for details about her file but never indicated that she intended to retire. She also specified that this is what explained the fact that the letter she sent to the Complainant on March 28, 2004, did not have an official letterhead on it. See Exhibit C-1, tab 25.\n[140] We are of the opinion that the error the Complainant identified in the Director of Executive Resourcing's e-mail does not have a negative impact on the Complainant. The position that was offered to her in January 2004 was maintained until the Complainant resigned in January 2005.\nH. The Respondent is responsible for the Complainant's resignation [141] The Complainant claims the Respondent treated her in such as way that when the International Programs Unit and the LAEPB closed, she felt forced to resign in January 2005, 5 years sooner than anticipated.\n[142] To properly evaluate this accusation, we need to keep in mind that in her letter of resignation, the Complainant blames the insurance company. She does not accuse her employer, which she has brought before the Human Rights Commission, of the serious allegations of discrimination.\n[143] During the hearing, when questioned about this anomaly, the Complainant explained that if her letter of resignation did not contain any accusations against the Respondent, it is because she was acting diplomatically in an area that did not recognize the concept. It seems to us that the Complainant could have resigned and demonstrated diplomacy without blaming the insurance company.\n[144] Where is the truth: when the Complainant wrote her letter or when she came to testify? We believe the most probable answer is that the Complainant identified the cause of her problems at the time she wrote her letter of resignation. It is not until she learned about the existence of recourse under the Canadian Human Rights Act that she became aware that recourse was only open against the employer and not the insurance company. Moreover, this recourse is only available if her employer discriminates against her in a manner that is prohibited by this Act.\nI. The Respondent is responsible for the deterioration in the Complainant's health [145] During the hearing, the Complainant claimed that the treatment she suffered by the Respondent, the Public Service Commission, in 2003 and 2004 was the main cause for the deterioration of her health.\n[146] To better demonstrate this claim, the Complainant had a member of her immediate family testify. He told the Tribunal what the Complainant told him, following telephone conversations with her immediate superior. He said that he was never present during these conversations. He described the Complainant's state, following the conversations, as a person who was angry. She told him that since her unit at work closed, she found herself in an unstable situation and the position offered by the Director of Executive Resourcing did not suit her. She felt very out of sorts.\n[147] On the other hand, the medical report of the psychiatrist, following examination of her patient in November 2004, which is produced as Exhibit R-2, tab 10, indicated that other factors of non-professional origin could explain, in part, the Complainant's health problems.\n[148] Finally, the Complainant's resignation letter produced as Exhibit R-1, tab 12, puts the blame on the shoulders of the insurance company and does not address any issues with the Respondent. See above for what was said about this resignation.\n[149] In our opinion, the Complainant's health problems could be attributed to factors of a personal nature and, largely, to difficulties experienced by the Complainant following the closing of the International Programs Unit and the LAEPB. It must be determined if the Respondent is responsible, pursuant to section 7 of the Act.\nIV. APPLICABLE LEGAL CRITERIA [150] The Complainant, who filed a discrimination complaint with the Human Rights Tribunal, first must convince the Tribunal of the existence of a prima facie case of discrimination by the Respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202). In this case, as the Complainant claimed discrimination based on age and disability: she would have to convince the Tribunal that the evidence submitted, which deals with the claims made, is complete and sufficient, as outlined by the Supreme Court in Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1995] 2. S.C.R. 536, paragraph 28:\n...The complainant in proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one that covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent employer...\n[151] As a result, to make a decision in this first step, the Tribunal must limit itself to analyzing only the testimonial and documentary evidence, filed by the Complainant. It must disregard the evidence submitted by the Respondent. See Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd. 2004 FAC 204 paragraph 22:\n[22] The approach taken by the Tribunal and upheld by the Trial Judge in determining whether a prima facie case of discrimination had been made out is not supported by the authorities. The appellant's prima facie case was that he sought a position of chief engineer on board the M.V. Princess of Acadia, that he was qualified for the position, that someone else was hired for the position and that his race played a part in the respondent's decision to hire the other candidates. By these allegations, the appellant might have established a prima facie of discrimination as explained in O'Malley, supra, that is, a case which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer. Instead of determining whether these allegations, if believed, justified a verdict in favour of the appellant, the Tribunal also took into account the respondent's answer before concluding that a prima facie case had not been established. As is clear from Etobicoke, supra, and O'Malley, this latter element does not figure into a determination of whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\n[152] If the Tribunal finds that a prima facie case has not been established regarding the essential elements of the allegation or finds that the evidence submitted is incomplete or not satisfactory, it must reject the complaint. See Canada (C.H.R.C.) v. C.N. (2000), 38 C.H.R.R. D\/107 (F.C.T.D.) In fact, it is really a question of knowing if each essential aspect of a discriminatory act is supported by evidence.\n[153] However, if it is of the opinion that a prima facie case was made, the burden of proof changes. It is then up to the Respondent to provide reasonable or satisfactory explanation for discriminatory practices (see Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 2004 (CANLII), 2004 FCA 204, paragraph 23; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 (CANLII), 2005 FCA 154, paragraphs 26 and 27).\n[154] However, an employer's conduct will not be considered discriminatory if it can show that any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act). For a practice to be considered a BFOR, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (subsection 15(2) of the Act).\n[155] The Respondent must also prove that the justification was not just a pretext to mask discriminatory practices. This was decided by the Federal Court in Canada (A.G.) v. Lambie (1996) C.H.R.R. D\/438.\n[156] The degree of proof required to determine the existence or non-existence of discrimination is the one that is required in civil cases, the balance of probabilities. The requirements of such evidence are less demanding than those required by a Court hearing a criminal case. Here is what the Court declared in Dawson v. Canada Post Corporation, 2008 CHRT 41 in paragraph 73:\n[73] This said, as stated in Wall v. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, (1997) C.H.R.D. 6, the standard of proof in discrimination cases remains the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities and that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the test is the following: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carswell, 1987, p. 142).\nV. WHAT ARE THE ISSUES [157] In reading the complaint filed by the Complainant against the Respondent, regarding discrimination based on age and disability, here are what appear to be the issues for determination:\nFirst Issue\nWhen the International Programs Unit closed June 30, 2003, and the LAEPB closed on October 31, 2003, did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment by reason of her age pursuant to section 7 of the Act?\nSecond Issue\nAt the time when the position of Program Coordinator was offered the to the Complainant and at the moment when the Complainant held this position, did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment because of her disability and, if so, did the employer meet its obligations in terms of accommodation pursuant to section 15 of the Act?\nThird Issue\nIn November 2004, did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment based on her disability by ignoring or refusing to agree to her request to return to work gradually and, if so, did the employer meets its obligations pursuant to section 15 of the Act?\nFourth Issue\nDid the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment as a result of her age, preferring to give the administrative assistant position to Ms. C.J. instead of the Complainant? Did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment in terms of her age pursuant to section 7 of the Act?\nFifth Issue\nDid the Respondent's conduct deprive the Complainant of employment opportunities and consequently contravene on section 10 of the Act?\nA. First Issue [158] When the International Programs Unit closed June 30, 2003, and the LAEPB closed on October 31, 2003, did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment by reason of her age pursuant to section 7 of the Act?\n(i) Prima facie evidence [159] The Complainant's arguments state that on June 30, when the International Program Unit closed and on October 31, 2003, when the LAEPB for the Public Service Commission closed its doors, she was without a job when all other employees, except for those who retired, who were all much younger than she, found a job.\n[160] The Complainant showed that all the other employees, except those who retired, were actually much younger than she, who was 59 at time; she claimed that all of them, except her, had found a job.\n[161] She showed, using letters of recommendation and supporting witnesses, that her work at DFAIT and at the Public Service Commission was generally very satisfactory and that no one could complain about her performance.\n[162] She claimed that she was of the opinion that only her age, 59, played against her and because of this, the Respondent demonstrated discrimination based on her age. She also blamed the Respondent for neglecting her, abandoning her and offering preferential treatment to other employees younger than she.\n[163] In the absence of any explanation that could justify why the Complainant remained jobless while her work seemed satisfactory, it would seem to us that the Complainant's age could be the only means to explain this situation.\n[164] For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Complainant has made prima facie case that the Respondent discriminated on the basis of age.\n(ii) Respondent's position [165] From the period starting with the closing of the International Programs Unit an the LAEPB and finishing the day when the Complainant resigned, she continued to be paid; she was employed and was assigned tasks considered to be at her level, except for a period of six weeks at the beginning of November, lasting until mid-December 2003.\n[166] It seems to us that this six-week period the Complainant spent alone in an empty office, that none of the witnesses, including the Chief of Human Resource Operations for the Public Service Commission, were able to explain, represents an aberrant and unimaginable situation.\n[167] The evidence adduced does not, however, allow us to confirm that representatives of the Respondent deliberately caused this. However, it is a neglectful and\/or an unpardonable oversight by Human Resources. Given everything we have learned about the Complainant, we are of the opinion that she certainly did not deserve to be treated in such a way.\n[168] We can easily imagine the anguish and the depression that the Complainant might have felt or experienced during this extended period. If an employer wanted to discourage or destroy an employee, there is no better way to do so.\n[169] Despite such a grievous mistake by representatives of the Respondent, we cannot blame this action, or lack thereof, on the Complainant's age.\n[170] It does not seem very relevant that the Complainant spent a considerable period of time without a written assignment; it seems that it is common practice and in this case, did not result in terrible consequences for the Complainant.\n[171] We accept the explanation provided by the Director of Human Resources that they gave the Complainant a year for her to find a new job, using her own means, particularly as the position that seemed to interest her appeared to be a promotion and the Respondent was not obligated to act in this situation.\n[172] We consider it normal that after realizing that the approach being used until the end of 2003 did not result in the Complainant finding a new job using her own means, that Human Resources decided to take matters into their own hands and to put pressure on the Complainant to find her a new job. This is why, through the Director of Executive Resourcing, a job was offered to the Complainant in January 2004.\n[173] The Complainant's claims that the Respondent did not take care of her and that her calls were not returned does not seem accurate to us. We would like to specify that the Respondent can only act through its employees. For this reason, we are of the opinion that we must evaluate the assistance received by the Complainant by considering the assistance from all other sources, namely the two Deputy Chairpersons for the Learning and Development Programs Branch, the Director of the Equity and Diversity Directorate, the Senior Strategic Advisor and the Director of Executive Resourcing.\n[174] During the hearing, we were able to establish that work had been done by Human Resources to help the Complainant find a new job. In summary, even if Human Resources did not return the Complainant's calls, which was challenged by the Chief of Human Resources, it seems to us that the Complainant was assisted in several ways.\n[175] However, we are of the opinion that the Complainant was not really informed in a timely manner.\n[176] This is a fact confirmed by the Deputy Chairpersons for the Learning and Development Programs Branch during the hearing when he said that all employees were supposed to have received the document, PSC Transformation Realigning for Modernization - Questions & Answers, Exhibit R-1, tab 2. But did Human Resources take the time to meet the Complainant every now and again to explain to her what they had done for her? Did they explain to her how they would help her in the future? Did they fully explain her situation to her? Did they offer to answer her questions? Was there not a communication problem?\n[177] If everything that was said during the hearing had been explained to the employee at the right time, there probably would not have been reason to file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission...nor would there have been a hearing and maybe the Complainant would have continued working for the Public Service until age 65.\n[178] With respect to the claim that special treatment was given to other employees who were moved to other positions, no proof of this was submitted.\n[179] With respect to the Complainant's allegation against the Respondent that her qualifications and experience were ignored, it would seem to us that this allegation hides the fact that the Complainant was more interested in an administrative-level position than a clerical one; however, we cannot lose sight of the fact that the Complainant was a CR-5.\n[180] Therefore, she cannot hold it against the Respondent for looking to assign her a clerical position and for not helping her find an administrative position. The Respondent's obligation is limited to placing the Complainant in a position of the same group and level.\n(iii) Conclusion [181] The evidence filed before the Tribunal is to the effect that the Respondent was not without blame. For example, the six-week period the Complainant spent alone and the lack of communication, as we have just explained.\n[182] However, our mandate does not allow us to act in such cases. We are limited to determining if the Respondent discriminated based on the Complainant's age, pursuant to section 7 of the Act.\n[183] We conclude in this situation, that the Respondent, despite the allegations we have already addressed, did not discriminate against the Complainant on the basis of her age.\nB. Second Issue [184] At the time when the position of Program Coordinator was offered the to the Complainant and at the moment when the Complainant held this position, did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment because of her disability and, if so, did the employer meet its obligations in terms of accommodation pursuant to section 15 of the Act?\n(i) Prima facie evidence [185] The Complainant claims she told the Director of Executive Resourcing during a phone call on January 20, 2004, about her fibromyalgia and that the position that he was offering was not compatible with her condition. According to her, he ignored this issue. She therefore informed him that there was a note from her family doctor dating back to 2001 in her file describing her fibromyalgia.\n[186] One of the complainant's witnesses declared he was aware of the existence of this note, having himself put it in the Complainant's file. At the time, in 2001, the Complainant benefited from special arrangements as a result of her disability.\n[187] Worried about losing her job, the Complainant felt obliged to accept the position offered and return to work. The Respondent did not take any note of the request for accommodation made by the Complainant.\n[188] For these reasons, the Tribunal is convinced that the Complainant showed that the Respondent demonstrated prima facie discrimination based on her disability.\n(ii) The Respondent's position [189] The Director of Executive Resourcing denies that the Complainant referred to her fibromyalgia during the telephone conversation on January 20, 2004, or on any other occasion. He described, however, what he would have done had the Complainant submitted such a request.\n[190] The Complainant stated that she called the Director of Executive Resourcing in February 2004, 2 weeks after the January 20 conversation. She gave the impression during this conversation that he scared her so much that she decided to accept his offer. However, the evidence shows that the Complainant had already signed a letter accepting this position on January 21.\n[191] Confronted with two diametrically opposed versions, what is to be done?\n[192] We must specify in the first place that the Director of Executive Resourcing being retired since, had no interest in the matter and would not have any reason to lie, given his Branch had been dissolved. However, the Complainant had a lot to gain or to lose.\n[193] The witness would have a little lose in consenting to the Complainant's accommodations. In fact, he could have made a solid ally at the time of her eventual return to work.\n[194] How could she say in this same letter in February that the Director of Executive Resourcing scared her so much during the telephone conversation that she decided to return to work and sign a contract as she had already signed the Response to the letter of appointment on January 21?\n[195] How could she, in this same letter in February, mention the names of doctors, a psychologist and a psychiatrist, when we were discussing accommodations related to the Complainant's fibromyalgia? These doctors were not involved until the summer of 2004 when the family doctor of the Complainant indicated that her patient was depressed.\n[196] In the circumstances, in the presence of two contradictory versions, we retain the Director of Executive Resourcing's version because this one seems most credible. We are of the opinion that the Complainant did not tell him that her fibromyalgia prevented her from carrying out tasks for the position offered to her and did not ask him for any accommodation.\n(iii) Conclusion [197] In this case, we conclude that when the Director of Executive Resourcing offered the Complainant the position of Program Coordinator, the Complainant did not tell him that she could not fulfill the duties of the position due to her fibromyalgia and did not make any requests for accommodation. We would like to specify that the Complainant, who would like to be accommodated, also has obligations to fulfill. One of these obligations is to inform the employer of the medical situation and the resulting needs. See: Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud (1992) 2 S.C.R. 970, pages 30 and 31.\n[198] As a result, we find that the Respondent did not discriminate against the Complainant based on her disability.\nC. Third Issue [199] In November 2004, did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment based on her disability by ignoring or refusing to agree to her request to return to work gradually and, if so, did the employer meets its obligations pursuant to section 15 of the Act?\n(i) Prima facie evidence [200] The Complainant claimed that at the beginning of November of 2004, the medications she had been taking for some time started to have a positive effect on her health. The effects of her depression began to subside.\n[201] She called her immediate supervisor, on November 8, 2004, to ask him if she could come back to work gradually, starting with 2 days per week.\n[202] He would have categorically refused her request for accommodation.\n[203] For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Complainant proved prima facie discrimination by the Respondent based on her disability.\n(ii) The Respondent's position [204] The Director of Executive Resourcing knew that the Complainant was on disability leave for depression. He claims having called her in September 2004 to determine the state of her health. He was told that her doctors did not want her to return to work.\n[205] However, he denies having received a call from the Complainant on November 8, 2004.\n[206] He reiterates not having been informed by the Complainant that she could not, due to her fibromyalgia, take the position he was offering and he never received, at any time, a request for accommodation from the Complainant.\n[207] He claims not having any memory that the Complainant told him that she felt well enough to return to work gradually in November, despite the recommendation of her psychiatrist.\n[208] None of the medical reports filed, referring to the period between May 2004 and March 31, 2005 indicate that the Complainant could return to work.\n[209] None of these medical reports suggested a gradual return to work by the Complainant.\n(iii) Conclusion [210] The medical reports from various doctors show the Complainant's inability to work. As a result, the actions taken by the Respondent's representatives were justified pursuant to section 15(2) of the Act.\n[211] The Complainant did not file with the Tribunal, any medical report supporting her ability to return to work gradually over the course of May 2004 to March 31, 2005.\n[212] The Respondent denies having received a request for a gradual return to work following her depression and as a result, denies having refused this request by the Complainant.\n[213] For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the Complainant did not show that the Respondent discriminated against her based on her disability.\nD. Fourth Issue [214] Did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment as a result of her age, preferring to give the administrative assistant position to Ms. C.J. instead of the Complainant? Did the Respondent differentiate adversely against the Complainant in the course of employment in terms of her age pursuant to section 7 of the Act?\n(i) Prima facie evidence [215] The Complainant claims she was not offered the position of Executive Assistant for the Deputy Chairperson of the LAEPB, when the position was offered to Ms. C.J., who was younger than her. Ms. C.J. was around 28 at the time and the Complainant was 59.\n[216] At first glance, the position seems important. Ms. C.J. is very young to hold such a position. The Complainant has several years of experience. Her experience seems to have more weight.\n[217] One factor could have been working against her: her age.\n[218] For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Complainant provided prima facie evidence of discrimination based on her age.\n(ii) The Respondent's position [219] The Deputy Chairperson for the Learning and Development Programs Branch does not remember if the Complainant showed any interest in the position given to Ms. C.J.; the Complainant did not indicate that she had applied for this position; she was not denied the right of appeal when Ms. C.J. was promoted to the said position.\n[220] Because of her status as affected employee, the Complainant was not in a position to be given a job in a preferential manner because the position was at a higher level than her, meaning a promotion.\n[221] The Deputy Chairpersons for the Learning and Development Programs Branch showed that Ms. C.J. had the experience necessary for the position as well as for the position that was given to Ms. C.J. at Industry Canada. In the latter situation, the Complainant herself supported his decision.\n[222] The Complainant cannot invoke her priority status at Industry Canada. Her priority is limited to the Department in which she works.\n(iii) Conclusion [223] For these reasons, we are of the opinion that the Complainant did not show that the Respondent discriminated against her based on her age when Ms. C.J. was given the position.\nE. Fifth Issue [224] Did the Respondent's conduct deprive the Complainant of employment opportunities and consequently contravene on section 10 of the Act?\n(i) Prima facie evidence [225] The complaint being examined claims that the Respondent discriminated against the Complainant based on her age and disability, in contravention of sections 7 (Employment) and 10 (Discriminatory policy or practice) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[226] Throughout the hearing of her evidence, the Complainant did not blame the Respondent for having applied a discriminatory policy or practice on the basis of age and disability. Moreover, she did not present evidence suggesting the Respondent used discriminatory policies or practices.\n[227] For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Complainant did not demonstrate prima facie evidence that the Respondent exercised discriminatory policies or practices based on her age or disability.\n(ii) Conclusion [228] The Complainant did not demonstrate that the Respondent was in contravention of section 10 of the Act.\nVI. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY? [229] The Tribunal concluded that the Complainant could not establish evidence of discrimination by the Respondent based on her age or her disability.\n[230] For this reason, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to make any specifications regarding remedies.\nSigned by R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nOTTAWA, Ontario February 3, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1324\/5408\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nShelley Ann Gravel v.

The Complaint Discrimination on the basis of sex \u2013 Differential treatment \u2013 Discriminatory practice\n[1] The Complainant, Guylaine B\u00e9langer, is a correctional officer employed with the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), one of the two Respondents in this case, and a member of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers (UCCO-SACC-CSN), which is affiliated with the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats nationaux (CSN), the other Respondent.\n[2] The Complainant alleges that on June 26, 2006, UCCO-SACC-CSN, on behalf of correctional officers, signed a collective agreement with Treasury Board and a Global Agreement with the CSC. She alleges that one of the provisions of the Global Agreement discriminated against female correctional officers like her who became correctional officers with the CSC after working in CSC administrative services.\n[3] She alleges that the signing of the Global Agreement was preceded by a smear campaign waged by male CX correctional officers against women who, like her, held CR positions before they became CX correctional officers, which allegedly had the effect of differentiating adversely in relation to them in the course of employment.\n[4] The Complainant alleges in her complaint that, in 1999, when she applied to be a correctional officer, the CSC was looking to hire female staff. No documents were produced to support that allegation.\n[5] She complains that after the Global Agreement was signed, her years of service in CSC administrative services, which to that point had been recognized by the Public Service for purposes of vacation leave, were no longer recognized; only her years of service as a correctional officer were recognized.\n[6] She alleges that the new rule discriminated on the basis of sex because it gave CX correctional officers, the majority of whom are male, favourable differential treatment and thus discriminated against women like her, former clerical employees who had held a CR position before being classified as CX.\nII. Analysis of the Facts A. Facts of the case (i) Complainant\u2019s work history [7] At the time she filed her complaint on November 20, 2006, the Complainant was working as a CX correctional officer at the Regional Reception Centre (RCC) in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines.\n[8] She began her career in the Public Service of Canada on April 16, 1989, with the Correctional Service of Canada, for the Department of the Solicitor General of Canada. She worked as an office clerk in the female-dominated CR group.\n[9] In December 1999, she changed careers: she joined the male-dominated CX correctional officer group and worked for the Correctional Service of Canada.\n[10] When she first started working as a correctional officer in 1999, for purposes of allocating vacation leave, she was given credit for all of her years of service in the Public Service since 1989. That continued until the summer of 2006. She remained a member of the Public Service Alliance of Canada until that union was replaced by UCCO-SACC-CSN in 2001.\n(ii) Adverse effects of the move from CR to CX [11] In 2001, correctional officers classified as CX in Canada\u2014more than 6,000\u2014left the Public Service Alliance of Canada en masse and joined a new union affiliated with the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats Nationaux (CSN) called the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers (UCCO-SACC-CSN).\n[12] UCCO-SACC-CSN submitted its draft collective agreement to Treasury Board on April 10, 2002.\n[13] On June 26, 2006, UCCO-SACC-CSN signed its first collective agreement with Treasury Board. The same day, the union signed a document with the CSC called the Global Agreement.\n[14] The purpose of the provisions of the Global Agreement was to clarify certain clauses of the collective agreement covering CX correctional officers.\n[15] Article 1-B-3 of the Global Agreement, the provision that gave rise to this complaint, reads:\n1-B-3\nVacation dates shall be chosen by any system agreed to at the local level prior to March 1st of each vacation year, or if agreement cannot be reached, the default process will be based on the years of service from the time an employee initially became a Correctional Officer.\n[16] The Complainant contends that UCCO-SACC-CSN was pressured by male CX officers at the RRC to adopt Article I-B-3 of the Global Agreement and that the CSC turned a blind eye to the move.\n[17] She alleges that when a vote was taken on a system based on seniority for granting vacation leave, the CX officers, most of whom are male, banded together to vote against former CR employees, the vast majority of whom are women, and that as a result, because they are a very small minority, the women were unable to express their point of view.\n[18] In the fall of 2006, the UCCO-SACC-CSN members at the RRC, asked to choose a method of granting annual leave as provided for in Article 1-B-3 of the Global Agreement, passed a resolution stating that until the next collective agreement was signed, only seniority as a correctional officer would be recognized. It was agreed at that time that the new rule, because it was adopted late in 2006, would not be applied until the summer of 2007 and would remain in force until the collective agreement expired on May 31, 2010.\n[19] For the Complainant and all other correctional officers who had been employed in the CR group, the consequences were such that, for the purpose of awarding vacation leave, they lost recognition of all of their years of service that had been recognized by the Public Service before they became correctional officers. They lost their ranking because only their years as a correctional officer counted.\n[20] The Complainant also complains that the content of Article 1-B-3 of the Global Agreement was expected to vary from year to year and that because women are the minority, their vote carried very little weight.\nSmear Campaign\n[21] The Complainant complains that at various times between the date she became a correctional officer in 1999 and the vote accepting the draft collective agreement was taken in the spring of 2002, and in the run-up to meetings of members at which there was to be a vote, there was a smear campaign against women who became CXs after holding CR positions.\n[22] During that period, several male correctional officers took the opportunity to make disrespectful and insulting comments about the female officers; they were mostly criticized for being entitled to having their years of service in the CR group recognized.\n[23] The male officers took the view that such favourable treatment of former female CR employees was unfair because during the years they spent in the Public Service, they had all their weekends and all their statutory holidays, worked days only, did not have to work in a dangerous environment like they did as correctional officers, spent their time serving coffee, etc.\nB. Facts admitted to by the three parties [24] The representatives of both UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC agree with the Complainant\u2019s statements regarding her work history, the change in union affiliation, and the signing and content of the collective agreement and the Global Agreement.\n[25] All of the parties agree on the impact of Article 1-B-3, namely, that it caused correctional officers, male and female alike, to lose recognition of their years of service in the Public Service before they became correctional officers, irrespective of their classification.\n[26] All of the parties agree that the CSC and UCCO-SACC-CSN had an anti-harassment policy and that the Complainant did not avail herself of that policy for the reason given by the Complainant herself and by her representative, as will be explained later.\nC. Facts disagreed with (i) The CSC was looking for female employees [27] One of the CSC witnesses, after checking the selection standards that were in effect on September 14, 1998, testified that the Complainant was mistaken when she stated that at the time she was hired in 1999, the CSC was looking for female staff. The document in question, which was still in effect in 1999, was produced in evidence by this same witness. It makes no reference to the sex of applicants. It must be remembered that the Complainant did not produce any documents to support her claim. Further, the statistics produced in evidence show that several men were hired during that period.\n(ii) Origin of Article 1-B-3: standardizing the procedure for granting leave [28] Regarding the smear campaign, the union denies that its leaders could have initiated it or even been involved in it in any way. It states that it was not told about the campaign and adds that there is an anti-harassment policy in place. It points out, however, that it was unable to apply the policy to the Complainant because it did not receive a complaint from her.\n[29] One of the employer\u2019s witnesses, an employee in the Human Resources Office, testified before the Tribunal that at no time prior to the vote on the draft collective agreement and the Global Agreement was the CSC informed of such a smear campaign. The witness added that the CSC also has an anti-harassment policy, but because it did not receive a complaint from the Complainant, it was unable to react in a timely manner.\n[30] The union does not admit that there was a smear campaign but suggests that the Complainant exaggerated by placing herself at the heart of the debate and claiming that the campaign waged at the RRC against her and the former secretaries, who had all been CRs in the Public Service, gave rise to Article 1-B-3.\n[31] According to the union witnesses involved in preparing, negotiating and signing the draft collective agreement and the Global Agreement, the request to establish procedures for granting leave simply came from all of the members at the 54 institutions across the country, who were of the opinion that the employer\u2019s system that was in place when the Alliance was their union was arbitrary and who therefore wanted to establish clear and consistent rules for all correctional officers in Canada.\n[32] In the absence of a Canada-wide procedure, before the new collective agreement came into effect and the Global Agreement was signed in 2006, each institution set its own rules, which could vary infinitely, with the result that the members voiced their dissatisfaction. Holding a random draw and granting vacation in alphabetical order or in order of years of service were among the methods used.\n[33] The union evidence supported by the testimony of several witnesses very closely involved in the consultations held in anticipation of a new draft agreement with Treasury Board and the CSC clearly showed that Article 1-B-3 of the Global Agreement was the product of national consultations and filled a need expressed by members across Canada.\n[34] It therefore seemed to negotiators and the membership that Article 1-B-3 was one of the methods most likely to win the support of the majority of members; in their view, the article laid the groundwork for a general rule, namely, that leave would be granted taking into account years of experience as a correctional officer, but the door would be left open for members at institutions who might prefer a different formula. According to the witnesses who appeared, the discussions that took place during the consultations did not focus on the issue of women who previously held CR positions.\n[35] Further, the members at each institution were given the option of requesting each year that the agreement be revisited and of proposing a different formula.\n[36] According to the union witnesses, some of the 54 correctional institutions in Canada did in fact use that option to adopt a different formula. At Kingston, members chose seniority in the Public Service. At Donnacona and Archambault (according to one of the witnesses for the Complainant in the case of Archambault), the members went with a grandfather clause.\n(iii) The CSC shares the union\u2019s point of view [37] An employee from the CSC\u2019s Human Resources Management Branch who was involved in negotiating the collective agreement and the Global Agreement stated in her testimony that Article 1-B-3, as submitted by the UCCO-SACC-CSN representatives, seemed reasonable to the employer\u2019s negotiators and moreover that they did not see it as having any adverse impact.\n[38] he employee also stated that she knew nothing about the Complainant\u2019s situation or the situation of other people at the RRC who might have had seniority as a CR and was never made aware of any problems in that regard.\n(iv) Concerted efforts of male officers against female officers [39] The Complainant\u2019s witnesses recounted several incidents that occurred in the workplace. The incidents entailed male CX officers making disrespectful and insulting comments about women who became CXs after working in CR positions. These incidents occurred many times, primarily in advance of meetings during which the members were to vote. They were so frequent that they came to be described as a smear campaign.\n[40] These same witnesses did not report any irregularity in the meetings of the members, nor did they observe facts similar to those presented in the previous paragraph.\n[41] The union witnesses, meanwhile, stated that they did not witness firsthand any incidents where male correctional officers made rude comments to female CXs who were formerly CRs, either outside or during meetings of the members.\n[42] Several union witnesses attended the members\u2019 meetings at the Regional Reception Centre (RRC), Leclerc, La Macaza, Joliette or Donnacona. All stated that at each institution, meetings pertaining to approval of the draft negotiations and adoption of the collective agreement and the Global Agreement and meetings that dealt with the choice of a method for establishing a procedure for granting leave at each of these establishments were conducted in an orderly and democratic manner.\n[43] They stated that the discussions were sometimes heated, but were always respectful and never went too far. There were two opposing camps. On one side were correctional officers who objected to seniority which employees might have accumulated in the Public Service before becoming a correctional officer being recognized in the collective agreement or by other means. On the other were correctional officers who sought recognition of their Public Service seniority prior to becoming a correctional officer.\n[44] Never did the issue of sex enter into the debate. Sex therefore could not have had any impact on the outcome of the various votes.\n(v) Impact of Article 1-B-3 for officers with seniority other than as CXs [45] The union argues that it is incorrect to say, as the Complainant did, that Article 1-B-3 adversely affected female CRs primarily.\n[46] Contrary to the Complainant\u2019s allegations that 1-B-3 adversely affected primarily former clerical staff, the majority of them women who had held CR positions, the witnesses for the union and the employer showed that female correctional officers who worked in CR positions were not the only group of employees adversely affected by Article 1-B-3. Other groups of employees were also affected.\n[47] They contended that there was a negative impact on all correctional officers, male and female alike, who had years of service in the Public Service before they became correctional officers.\n[48] The following is a partial list of categories of workers, mostly male, who had experience in the Public Service in a group other than CR before becoming a correctional officer:\nFirefighters (mostly men) National Defence (mostly men) Ex-military (mostly men) Technical maintenance (mostly men) National ports (mostly men) Trades (mostly men) Nursing (only one case discussed: man)\n[49] The following is a list of employment categories which were mentioned at the hearing but the discussion of which did not indicate which sex was in the majority:\nCook Laundry Personal items\n[50] The information provided during the hearing was insufficient to establish the sex of workers who had years of service in the Public Service before becoming a correctional officer at the various correctional institutions in Canada.\n[51] For all of these employees, regardless of sex, who came from different fields and had experience elsewhere in the Public Service before becoming a CX with the CSC, those years of service were no longer recognized. The union argued that it is therefore clear that 1-B-3 had an adverse impact not only on women who had held CR positions, but also on men who had held CR positions and a host of workers, men and women alike, who had held positions in other groups.\n[52] The impact was no more disastrous for women than for men; in fact, the effects were the same for correctional officers of both sexes.\nD. Analysis of the case by the parties (i) The Complainant limited her study to the RRC [53] Ms. B\u00e9langer\u2019s complaint is based on her personal experience at the Regional Reception Centre (RRC) in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines. It takes into consideration female correctional officers at that institution and the few men who, like her, lost the years of service they had accumulated in the federal public service.\n[54] It appears that at that institution, more than anywhere else, male correctional officers were more hostile toward and disrespectful of female CRs.\n[55] The Complainant\u2019s perception is based solely on her personal experience at the Regional Reception Centre. According to the numbers provided by the employer and not contested by the union, the number of people at the RRC adversely affected by Article 1-B-3 was:\nin 2007, two men and six women; in 2008, nine men and 11 women.\n[56] The Complainant\u2019s representative stated that in order to assess the impact of the application of Article 1-B-3 and determine the number of employees adversely affected, we have to go back to the day the members voted in favour of the Global Agreement, that is, June 26, 2006, and that the fluctuation in the number of members in subsequent years should not be taken into account. He justified his position by stating that at the time the vote was taken, women were in the majority.\n[57] As shown in the following paragraphs, the Complainant and the union did not use the same population or the same date in analyzing the situation.\n(ii) The union based its analysis on the 54 correctional institutions in Canada [58] The union contends that the Complainant considered the effect of Article 1-B-3 in the context of the Regional Reception Centre in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines only and wants Article 1\u2011B\u20113 to be repealed even though it was adopted by and applies to members at all correctional institutions in Canada.\n[59] The union also contends that the Complainant based her assessment of the impact of the article on 2006 only, yet the collective agreement spans several years. In its view, she should have assessed the impact over a period covering each year of the collective agreement.\n[60] The union contends that the Complainant claimed discrimination solely on grounds that a majority of women at the RRC were affected by 1-B-3. In the union\u2019s opinion, a simple majority is not enough. Other factors have to be considered, as will be demonstrated later in the review of applicable case law.\n[61] According to UCCO-SACC-CSN, it would be a serious mistake to consider the Complainant\u2019s complaint based solely on an analysis of the impact of Article 1-B-3 in a single institution. The union states that any examination of the situation must take the RRC into account, of course, but must also look at what happened at the other 53 federal correctional institutions in Canada. There were 54 institutions in 2006. Article 1-B-3 appears to have been adopted in the interest of the more than 6,000 correctional officers employed at federal correctional institutions across the country.\n[62] The union states that at all of the institutions examined, women were not the group most affected by the article; for example, it alleges that the number of officers adversely affected by Article 1-B-3 at the following institutions was:\nLa Macaza: in 2007, 13 men and 5 women; in 2009, 17 men and seven women;\nLeclerc: in 2006, according to Exhibit I-3, tab (29), 15 men and five women may have been adversely affected by the article (even though it did not come into force until 2007); in 2007, 11 men and seven women; and in 2008, 12 men and seven women.\n[63] It appears that at these two institutions, more men than women were adversely affected when CX seniority was adopted.\n[64] Even at the Regional Reception Centre (RRC), where the Complainant worked in 2007, two men and six women were apparently adversely affected by the article. In 2008, nine men and 11 women were adversely affected. The numbers clearly show that the majority which existed in 2006 had mostly vanished.\n[65] The union contends that the majority of men nationwide did not vote for CX seniority; for example, at Donnacona, where men are at a 74% majority, the vote was in favour of a grandfather clause.\n[66] A grandfather clause recognizes, for vacation purposes, years worked in the Public Service before becoming a correctional officer.\n[67] The union challenges the Complainant\u2019s claim that the situation would be different if the majority of members were women. For example, CX seniority was adopted at Joliette, where most of the correctional officers are women. In 2007, five men and 27 women voted for CX seniority and one man and six women voted against.\n[68] The union contends that the votes were not driven by sex; as stated previously, the evidence showed that at each institution examined in the course of the hearing, sex was not an issue in the discussions that took place in the following locations: Leclerc, La Macaza, Joliette, Donnacona and even the Regional Reception Centre (RRC).\n(iii) CSC spoke for all correctional institutions in Canada [69] An employee from CSC\u2019s Human Resources Management Branch stated in her testimony that the needs or situation at all correctional institutions, not individual institutions, were taken into consideration during the negotiations.\n[70] She added that she was never asked about and was never informed of any specific situation concerning the RRC that would have warranted including a specific clause in the collective agreement or the Global Agreement.\n[71] She stated that at no time before the collective agreement or the Global Agreement was signed did she hear about a situation involving the Complainant and the smear campaign.\n[72] The employer\u2019s negotiators were satisfied by the UCCO-SACC-CSN negotiators that their request to negotiate the procedure for granting leave had only one purpose, and that was to standardize the procedure across the country.\n[73] She stated that the employer\u2019s negotiators usually assessed the impact of union demands in terms of cost and feasibility. She admitted, however, that she did not do an impact study of Article 1-B-3.\n[74] Overall, the union\u2019s demand regarding the procedure for granting leave seemed reasonable to them.\n[75] Regarding the notion of seniority that is so dear to unions, she pointed out that the notion does not apply in the federal public service. Seniority was also not incorporated into the collective agreement with the union signed in June 2006.\n[76] The witness did not dwell on the distinction between seniority and years of service, but did say that in the federal public service, the more common term is years of service. Further, the Public Service recognizes the merit principle.\n(iv) The parties\u2019 analyses do not carry the same weight [77] This overview of the positions taken by the Complainant, the union and the employer shows that the parties\u2019 points of reference are different and do not have the same scope.\n[78] We should note for the moment that the Complainant\u2019s analysis was limited to one institution, the Regional Reception Centre in Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines, where she worked, and that the UCCO-SACC-CSN and CSC analyses looked at all 54 correctional institutions in Canada.\n[79] We should also note that the Complainant\u2019s representative stated that in order to evaluate the impact of Article 1-B-3, we have to go back to the day the members voted in favour of the Global Agreement, that is, June 26, 2006, and that the subsequent years should not be taken into account. The Complainant added that because the majority of women at her institution were adversely affected, there was discrimination on grounds of sex.\n[80] The union, meanwhile, argues that in order to assess the impact of the article, we must consider the effects produced in each year of the Global Agreement and the collective agreement. Both agreements were signed on June 26, 2006, and will remain in effect until May 31, 2010. In fact, it was not until the summer of 2007 that the new seniority rules applicable to vacation were enforced. Consequently, in the eyes of the union, the 2006 date used by the Complainant cannot be justified. The union further argues that it is not enough to show that the majority of women were adversely affected; it must also be shown that there was more harm to women than to men, which the Complainant\u2019s evidence failed to do in this case.\nIII. Applicable Law A. Establishment of a prima facie case [81] Paragraph 7(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that it is a discriminatory practice in the course of employment to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination listed in section 3; in the case at hand, sex was the alleged ground of discrimination.\n[82] Paragraph 10(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act states that it is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization to enter into an agreement that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on any of the prohibited grounds of discrimination listed in section 3; in the case at hand, sex was the alleged ground of discrimination.\n[83] In any human rights case brought before the Tribunal, the complainant has a duty to present the Tribunal with facts showing the existence of prima facie evidence of discrimination. The complainant cannot simply offer an opinion or convey an impression of discrimination.\n[84] In this case, because she alleged discrimination on grounds of sex, the Complainant must provide the Tribunal with complete and sufficient testimonial and\/or documentary evidence to support the allegations made in her complaint, as the Supreme Court determined in Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28:\nThe complainant in proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent\u2011employer.\n[85] Consequently, in order to make a decision at this first stage, the Tribunal must limit its analysis to the testimonial and documentary evidence produced by the Complainant. The Tribunal must ignore the evidence submitted by the Respondent in response. See Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at paragraph 22:\n[22] The approach taken by the Tribunal and upheld by the Trial Judge in determining whether a prima facie case of discrimination had been made out is not supported by the authorities. The appellant\u2019s prima facie case was that he sought a position of chief engineer on board the M.V. Princess of Acadia, that he was qualified for the position, that someone else was hired for the position and that his race played a part in the Respondent's decision to hire the other candidates. By these allegations, the appellant might have established a prima facie of discrimination as explained in O\u2019Malley, supra, that is, a case which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent-employer. Instead of determining whether these allegations, if believed, justified a verdict in favour of the appellant, the Tribunal also took into account the Respondent\u2019s answer before concluding that a prima facie case had not been established. As is clear from Etobicoke , supra, and O\u2019Malley, this latter element does not figure into a determination of whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\n[86] Further, the Complainant\u2019s allegations must be sufficiently credible to support a conclusion that a prima facie case exists (Dhanjal v. CHRC, (1997) CanLII 5751 (F.C.), at paragraph 6).\n[87] Finally, if the Tribunal determines that there is no prima facie evidence relating to a key element of the allegations or that the evidence produced is incomplete or insufficient, it must dismiss the complaint. See C.H.R.C. v. C.N., (2000) 38 C.H.R.R.D\/107 (F.C.). What it really comes down to is determining whether every key element of the discriminatory act is supported by evidence.\nB. Defences [88] However, if the Tribunal determines that a prima facie case has been made out, the burden of proof shifts. The onus is then on the Respondents to show that the Complainant\u2019s allegation of discrimination is without merit because there was no discrimination or the practice which gave rise to the complaint was not discriminatory or was justified. In the latter case, the Respondents can provide reasonable or satisfactory explanations for the otherwise discriminatory practice. (See Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd, 2004 FCA 204 (CanLII), 2004 FCA 204, paragraph 23; Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 (CanLII), paragraphs 26 and 27).\n[89] However, an employer\u2019s practice will not be considered discriminatory if the employer is able to show that its refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to employment is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act). In order for a practice to be considered to be a bona fide occupational requirement, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (subsection 15(2) of the Act).\n[90] The Respondent must also establish that the justification is not merely a pretext to cover up a discriminatory practice. This was determined by the Federal Court in Canada (A.G.) v. Lambie, (1996) 29 C.H.R.R.D.\/483.\nC. Evidence [91] The standard of proof for determining whether there is discrimination is the standard required in civil matters, that is, the balance of probabilities. The requirements of that standard are less stringent than those applicable in criminal court. The Tribunal wrote the following in Dawson v. Canada Post Corporation, 2008 TCDP 41, at paragraph 73 :\n[73] This said, as stated in Wall v. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, (1997) C.H.R.D. 6, the standard of proof in discrimination cases remains the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities and that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the test is the following: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (B.Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carswell, 1987, p. 142).\n[92] The case law has long recognized the difficulty faced by complainants seeking to establish proof of their allegations of discrimination.\n[93] In the case at hand, the Complainant must show that she was the subject of adverse differentiation in the course of employment because of her sex and\/or that the adoption of Article 1-B-3 of the Global Agreement deprives or tends to deprive her of employment opportunities.\nIV. Analysis A. Did the smear campaign cause Ms. B\u00e9langer to be the subject of adverse differentiation in the course of employment? (s. 7 of the Act) (i) The Complainant was unable to make out a prima facie case\nSmear campaign\n[94] The Complainant alleges that the smear campaign waged by several male CX correctional officers at the RRC against female correctional officers with CR experience recognized by the Public Service differentiated adversely in relation to her in the course of employment. She claims that the campaign reached its peak at the start of the 2001 raiding campaign.\n[95] Despite the proximity in time between the smear campaign and the raiding campaign, the evidence heard did not show that the two campaigns were connected.\n[96] The Complainant and her witnesses showed that there was indeed a smear campaign and that she was humiliated as a result of the campaign.\n[97] The Complainant alleges that the smear campaign differentiated adversely in relation to her in the course of employment. However, she did not offer any explanation or give any example that might explain how the campaign affected her.\n[98] We can conclude from the evidence produced that the smear campaign was a personal undertaking by male CX correctional officers who found the situation frustrating.\n[99] The evidence did not show that UCCO-SACC-CSN or the CSC was behind the smear campaign, encouraged it or simply turned a blind eye to it.\n[100] The UCCO-SACC-CSN and CSC representatives, meanwhile, state that there may have been a smear campaign, but if there was, they had no knowledge of it. They deny that their representatives or agents could have been involved in the campaign in any way. Consequently, they are exempted from the presumption set out in section 65 of the Act.\n[101] The complaint of discrimination which the Complainant filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission was against UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC. UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC are therefore the only Respondents.\n[102] The individuals considered responsible for the campaign were simply not named as Respondents.\n[103] Consequently, although she alleges that she was the subject of adverse differentiation in the course employment as a result of the harassment campaign, the Complainant was unable to establish proof of discrimination. Nor can she blame UCCO-SACC-CSN and\/or the CSC for the campaign, because none of their employees, agents, officers or directors, as the case may be, initiated or consented to the campaign in the course of their employment. In addition, both organizations put in place an anti-harassment policy that sent a clear message to all staff that harassment would not be tolerated. The union and the employer took those measures to prevent such incidents from recurring. They therefore cannot be held accountable for discrimination on grounds of sex.\nHarassment\n[104] The facts presented by the Applicant alleging that there was a smear campaign which caused her to be the subject of adverse differentiation in the course employment are the same as the facts on which her allegation of harassment is based.\n[105] The Complainant was aware of the CSC\u2019s and UCCO-SACC-CSN\u2019s harassment policies, but she decided it would serve no purpose to avail herself of them and file a harassment complaint with both parties at the time of or subsequent to the smear campaign. She stated that she did not think the policies were effective. The Complainant\u2019s representative acknowledged that the comments said to have been made during the campaign were not tolerated by the CSC, but attributed the absence of a complaint to the fact that no specific woman was targeted and they hoped the harassment campaign would end.\n[106] Consequently, because they did not receive a formal complaint, UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC could not support the Complainant in any way and therefore cannot be accused of negligence or an omission of any kind. Without a complaint, they did not get an opportunity to mitigate or avoid the effects of the campaign, as provided for in section 65 of the Act.\nImpact on the decision-making process\n[107] Despite the fact there was a smear campaign, the Complainant was unable to prove that at\npreliminary and\/or information meetings about bargaining, the meeting during which the collective agreement and the Global Agreement were ratified, and the meeting during which CX seniority was adopted,\nthe men voted against the women.\n[108] She failed to show that at those meetings the democratic process was not respected or was skewed against female correctional officers who had previously held CR positions, or that sex was at the heart of the debate.\n[109] While it is likely that the smear campaign that preceded the various votes by the membership may have had an effect prima facie on the democratic process, the evidence produced before the Tribunal does not permit an assessment of the impact on the adoption of Article 1-B-3 or the decision by the members at the RRC to adopt CX seniority as the method for granting vacation leave. We believe the democratic and respectful conduct of the meetings avoided or significantly mitigated the adverse effects of the smear campaign.\n[110] We cannot conclude from the evidence heard that in the other 53 correctional institutions in Canada there was a smear campaign like the one at the RRC, that the sex factor had any bearing on the adoption of Article 1-B-3 or that the men voted against the women.\n(ii) Was the Complainant the subject of adverse differentiation in relation to another group? [111] The Complainant alleges that Article 1-B-3 had an adverse impact especially on women at the RRC where she worked. As we saw earlier, that assertion is more or less true. We need only examine the statistics produced by the Complainant herself (Exhibit P\u20111, tab 9) and admitted to by the CSC and UCCO-SACC-CSN to realize this.\n[112] The statistics show that the number of men and women adversely affected by the application of 1-B-3 at the RRC in the first year the new procedure for granting vacation leave was used (2007) was almost the same in 2008. To determine the effects of Article 1\u2011B-3, we have to consider not only women who were previously employed in the CR group, but also other men and women at the RRC who were employed in a different group before they became CXs. Exhibit P-1, tab 9, indicates that 10 employees (nine women and one man) were previously employed in the CR group and that nine employees (eight men and one woman) were previously employed in another group.\n[113] However, the fact that there were slightly more women than men at the RRC who were affected by 1-B-3 does not constitute sufficient grounds to allege discrimination on the basis of sex. To support that assertion, we believe it is appropriate to reproduce several excerpts from the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Thibaudeau v. Her Majesty the Queen, (1994) 2 D.F. 189:\nPage 9 \u2026\nIndeed, in my view it is not because more women than men are adversely affected, but rather because some women, no matter how small the group, are more adversely affected than the equivalent group of men, that a provision can be said to discriminate on grounds of sex.\n\u2026\nAccordingly, it seems to me that one cannot logically say that an otherwise neutral rule discriminates on the basis of sex simply because it affects more members of one sex than of the other. \u2026The focus, surely, is not on numbers but on the nature of the effect; on quality rather than quantity. If legislation which adversely affects women has the same adverse effect upon men, even though their numbers may be smaller or the likelihood of their suffering be less, it cannot logically be said that the ground of discrimination is sex.\nNote: This decision was quashed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Thibaudeau v. Canada, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 627. The decision was apparently amended, but for reasons other than those alleged above.\n[114] The evidence produced by the Complainant was not sufficient to show that there was prima facie evidence of discrimination within the meaning of paragraph 7(b) of the Act.\n[115] The number of women affected adversely by 1-B-3 was similar to the number of men. The effects of the application of Article 1-B-3 were identical for officers of both sexes.\n[116] The Complainant therefore failed to show that the adverse effects were greater for women at the RRC than for male employees at the RRC who had been employed in a different group before becoming CXs. Everyone lost recognition of his or her years of service in the Public Service prior to becoming a correctional officer.\n[117] The evidence produced showed that the situation was the same at all institutions in Canada.\n[118] Consequently, the Complainant failed to show with prima facie evidence that she was the subject of adverse differentiation in the course of employment in relation to men in a situation similar to hers.\nAdverse differentiation in the course of employment\n[119] As stated earlier, the evidence produced did not show that the smear campaign caused the Complainant to be the subject of adverse differentiation in the course of employment.\n[120] We stated earlier that we came to the conclusion that (1) the evidence showed that no employee, agent, officer or director of UCCO-SACC-CSN or the CSC was responsible in any way in the course of his or her employment for the smear campaign the Complainant had to endure; (2) both the union and the employer took all necessary measures to prevent this type of abuse by adopting anti-harassment rules of conduct; and (3) because the Complainant did not file a complaint against the campaign, neither UCCO-SACC-CSN nor the CSC could endeavour to avoid or mitigate its effects.\n[121] The Complainant therefore failed to produce prima facie evidence showing that the two Respondents differentiated adversely in relation to her in the course of employment and that she was discriminated against by the two Respondents on grounds of sex.\nB. Did the adoption of Article 1-B-3 deprive or tend to deprive Ms. B\u00e9langer of employment opportunities within the meaning of section 10 of the Act?\n(i) The Complainant failed to establish a prima facie case [122] Because the phrase employment opportunities is an important element of paragraph 10(b) of the Act, we believe it is appropriate to use the meaning ascribed in the following decision, an excerpt of which is provided below. Paragraphs 97 and 98 of Walden et al. v. Social Development Canada, December 13, 2007, CHRT read:\n[97] The French version of s. 10 refers to practices that deny or tend to deny les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus. When the French and English versions of s. 10 are read together, one is led to the conclusion that the term employment opportunities refers to conditions which enable employment and the advancement of individuals in their employment.\n[98] This interpretation is reflected in the Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence wherein the term employment opportunities has been used to refer to opportunities to transfer to another job (Gauthier v. Canadian Armed Forces, [1989] C.H.R.D. No. 3 T.D. 3\/89; opportunities to do certain kinds of work that would enhance earnings and career potential (O\u2019Connell v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp, [1988] C.H.R.D. No. T.D. 9\/88); training opportunities (Green v. Canada (Public Service Commission), [1998] C.H.R.D. No. T.D. 6\/98, reviewed on other grounds in: Canada (Attorney General) v. Green, [2000] 4 F.C. 629 (T.D.)); and continued and uninterrupted employment (Hay v. Cameco, [1991] C.H.R.D. No. 5 No. T.D. 5\/91).\nNote: An application for judicial review of this CHRT decision in Walden was dismissed by the Federal Court (neutral citation 2010 FC 490). The Federal Court\u2019s decision has been appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal (Docket A-219-10).\n[123] The Complainant showed that the application of 1-B-3 had only one adverse effect, and that was to cause her to lose recognition of her seniority in the Public Service for purposes of granting vacation leave. She failed to show that she was the subject of any other adverse differentiation. She did not allege any adverse effect 1-B-3 might have had on her opportunities for promotion, the chances of being laid off or transferred, or any other working condition. She did not satisfy the Tribunal that 1\u2011B\u20113 discriminated against her on grounds of sex.\n[124] Consequently, her evidence failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under paragraph 10(b) of the Act because it did not show that the adoption of 1-B-3 deprived or tended to deprive her of employment opportunities in any way.\n[125] If we were to conclude that the Complainant lost an employment opportunity, which the evidence did not show, we would have to determine whether the Respondents are exempted from the presumption set out in section 65 of the Act, which reads:\n65. (1) Subject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\n(2) An act or omission shall not, by virtue of subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[126] Under subsection 65(1), the Respondents, the CSC and UCCO-SACC-CSN, as employer of the persons who took part in the smear campaign, would be considered responsible for the actions of their members or employees.\n[127] However, under subsection (2), the Respondents would be exempted from that presumption if they were able to show that they exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof. The evidence heard indicated that the smear campaign, which the Complainant described as harassment, was carried out unbeknownst to the Respondents; the Respondents had taken the necessary measures to prevent harassment by adopting anti-harassment guidelines of which the Complainant was aware. However, for reasons explained earlier, the Complainant chose not to avail herself of those guidelines. Consequently, the Respondents were unable to endeavour to mitigate or avoid the effects of the campaign and are exempted from the presumption set out in section 65.\nVested or individual rights\n[128] Since the Complainant alleges that, as a result of the application of 1-B-3, termination of the recognition of her years of service that had previously been recognized by the Public Service for purposes of granting vacation leave was a breach of her vested rights, we believe it is important to clarify the following points: (1) Are we in fact dealing with vested rights? and (2) How does respect for vested rights come into play in human rights?\n[129] It must be recalled at the outset that before 1-B-3 was adopted, all of her years of service were recognized by the Public Service for purposes of granting vacation leave. It should be noted, however, that that recognition was not provided for in the collective agreement between Treasury Board and the Public Service Alliance of Canada, which at the time represented CSC administrative staff before it was replaced by UCCO-SACC-CSN. At most, these were individual rights acquired over a number of years, not collective rights.\n[130] The case law recognizes the right to modify the vested rights of parties, in particular seniority rights. See H\u00e9mond v. Coop\u00e9rative f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9e du Qu\u00e9bec, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 962:\nThough it is possible in some cases to interpret a collective agreement so as to give seniority rights to certain workers, one cannot simply ignore the terms of such an agreement in order to give employees vested rights in the matter. Seniority rights are subject to the collective bargaining process like any other employee right. In the context of labour relations it would be singular, to say the least, for these rights to be absolutely and irremediably raised to the level of vested rights. When a collective agreement exists, individual rights are for all practical purposes superseded. As Laskin C.J. said at p. 725 of McGavin Toastmaster Ltd. v. Ainscough, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 718, in which the Court adopted a rule stated in Syndicat catholique des employ\u00e9s de magasins du Qu\u00e9bec Inc. v. Compagnie Paquet Lt\u00e9e, [1959] S.C.R. 206:\nThe common law as it applies to individual employment contracts is no longer relevant to employer\u2011employee relations governed by a collective agreement which, as the one involved here, deals with discharge, termination of employment, severance pay and a host of other matters that have been negotiated between union and company as the principal parties thereto.\n[131] The common law applicable to individual and collective contracts continues to apply even in human rights cases provided, as stated in Etobicoke, supra, the parties are not able to waive statutory human rights by contract.\n[132] Based on this analysis, we conclude, first, that the Complainant cannot claim to have lost vested rights related to the granting of vacation leave because she did not have such rights before 1-B-3 was adopted and, second, that in any event, it would have been possible to modify them by inserting a clause in the collective agreement. It should be remembered that the purpose of the Global Agreement was to clarify some of the provisions of the collective agreement covering CX correctional officers. Third, neither UCCO-SACC-CSN nor the CSC breached any provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n[133] The Complainant failed to show that there were vested seniority rights. She was unable to give a single example which showed that she was the subject of adverse differentiation in the course of employment within the meaning of section 7 of the Act or that she was deprived of or likely to be deprived of employment opportunities within the meaning of section 10. As a result, she was unable to prove that UCCO-SACC-CSN and\/or the CSC, in the context of the harassment campaign or the adoption of Article 1-B-3, engaged in a practice that discriminated against the Complainant on grounds of sex, differentiated adversely in relation to her in the course of employment, or deprived or tended to deprive her of employment opportunities.\n(ii) Was the explanation provided by UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC merely a pretext? [134] Even if the Complainant had been successful in establishing a prima facie case, we would be of the opinion that the explanation provided by UCCO-SACC-CSN and endorsed by the CSC was not a pretext. The reasons given by the UCCO-SACC-CSN and CSC witnesses seemed to us to be perfectly valid and reasonable.\n[135] Our impression is that both the union and the employer acted in good faith. We make this point even knowing full well that good faith is not a determinative factor in assessing the reasonableness of an explanation.\n[136] The fact that every institution is allowed under Article 1-B-3 to choose a formula other than CX seniority is not, in our view, inconsistent with the stated desire of union leaders to standardize the process of granting leave. At most it represents the right of members to adopt each year at a meeting of the membership a different formula that better meets the needs of each institution at a given time.\n[137] Granting that right to the members at each institution conveys a desire to standardize the process of granting leave. In that sense, the rules are the same across Canada. We believe that standardization of the process was a bona fide justification, not a pretext.\nV. Decision [138] The smear campaign on the basis of sex of which the Complainant claims to be a victim cannot be attributed to the two Respondents, namely, the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) and the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers (UCCO-SACC-CSN), for the following reasons. The evidence showed that no employee, agent, officer or director of either Respondent initiated or supported the campaign in the course of his or her employment; that the campaign was conducted without their consent; that they took all necessary measures to prevent such abuse, specifically by adopting an anti-harassment policy; and finally that they were unable to avoid or mitigate the effects of the campaign for the simple reason that the Complainant did not exercise her right to file a complaint.\n[139] Further, the evidence produced by the Complainant did not show that the smear campaign, a discriminatory practice in which UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC were accused of engaging, differentiated adversely in relation to her in the course of employment within the meaning of paragraph 7(b) of the Act or deprived or tended to deprive her of employment opportunities within the meaning of section 10 of the Act. Consequently, neither Respondent can be held accountable for the campaign.\n[140] The adoption of Article 1-B-3 of the Global Agreement by UCCO-SACC-CSN and the CSC cannot be construed as discrimination on grounds of sex. It did not differentiate adversely in relation to the Complainant in the course of employment within the meaning of paragraph 7(b) of the Act, nor did it deprive or tend to deprive her of employment opportunities within the meaning of paragraph 10(b) of the Act. In fact, we are of the opinion, based on the evidence produced, that the adoption of 1-B-3 was justified and reasonable.\n[141] The Respondents are exempted from the presumption set out in section 65 of the Act, as amply explained elsewhere in this decision.\n[142] For all these reasons, the complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langerTribunal Member\nOttawa, OntarioNovember 16, 2010\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1419\/4509 and T1420\/4609\nStyle of Cause:\nGuylaine B\u00e9langer v.

Lustig Date: November 24, 2010 Citation: 2010 CHRT 31\n[1] This is a Ruling on the motion of the Complainant to amend her Complaint by adding additional prohibited grounds of discrimination and a discriminatory practice to her Complaint.\n[2] In August 2004, the Complainant applied for a position as a client services agent at Canada Revenue Agency's Vancouver Tax Services Office. In her application, the Complainant provided her phone number, email address and residential address to the Respondent.\n[3] On June 28, 2005, the Complainant was accepted into a large pool of applicants who were determined qualified for the job.\n[4] Subsequently, the Respondent attempted to reach the Complainant by telephone, using the original contact information, to offer her the job. However, the Complainant by then had a new phone number, new email address and the same residential address and she could not be reached using the phone number from the original contact information.\n[5] The pool of qualified applicants expired June 27, 2007.\n[6] In September 2007, the Complainant wrote a letter to Rod Quiney, Regional Assistant Commissioner (Pacific Region) for the Respondent, asking him to hire her directly for a similar position in Victoria. In her letter, the Complainant described her complaint that the Respondent should have used the new phone and e-mail contact information, but she did not mention any other complaints.\n[7] In October 2007, Mr. Quiney replied to the Complainant's letter, refusing her request that he hire her. He gave several reasons for his refusal including the fact that the job she had qualified for was at the Vancouver office and that the pool that she was placed in had expired.\n[8] On June 10, 2008, the Complainant filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) against the Respondent alleging discrimination related to employment on the prohibited ground of family status and, as well, alleged retaliation. The Complaint alleges that the discriminatory conduct took place in Vancouver from September 2005 to October 29, 2007.\n[9] The Complaint alleges that the Respondent failed to hire the Complainant because of her relationship to her brother-in-law Chris Hughes who represents her in this matter and because of retaliation for a previous human rights complaint she filed against the Respondent. The Complaint alleges that Chris Hughes is known to several of the Respondent's managers, including Rod Quiney, because Hughes has filed an Internal Affairs complaint (involving the Complainant in part), civil suits, human rights complaints, Federal Court challenges, grievances and Labour Relations Board complaints against the Respondent and was a documented whistle blower and was CRA 's no 1 enemy.\n[10] On December 12, 2009, the Complainant sent a second Complaint Form to the Commission (the Amended Complaint). The Amended Complaint was identical to the original Complaint Form except for two extra paragraphs at the end, which (1) alleged that the investigation revealed unintentional discrimination in the Respondent's method of keeping, updating and using contact information and (2) stated that the Complainant self-identified as a visible minority, provided a passport that showed Vietnam as place of birth, she is Chinese ethnically and has yellow\/asian skin colour. The Amended Complaint requested that the Commission investigate this file under the additional grounds of national or ethnic origin, race, colour and section 10 (a) in addition to the current family status and retaliation.\n[11] After receiving the Amended Complaint, Commission Investigator Dean Steacy allegedly told the Complainant's representative (Chris Hughes) that the Amended Complaint would be untimely and would cause a long delay in the file.\n[12] On February 25, 2010, Mr. Hughes, on behalf of the Complainant, withdrew the Amended Complaint.\n[13] On July 16, 2010 the Commission referred the original Complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry pursuant to paragraph 44 (3) (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA). The Amended Complaint was not part of the referral.\n[14] In her Notice of Motion the Complainant states that:\nNow that the file is with the Tribunal we ask that the Tribunal grant this motion to add the following grounds, in additional to the current grounds of family status and retaliation:\nSex (female), national or ethnic origin, race, colour as the complaint is female, Chinese\/Asian born in Vietnam;\nand section 10 (a) due to the respondent's hiring practices and policies that prevented fully qualified female, visible minority from receiving a job offer.\n[15] The Complainant's submissions, in support of her motion dated September 16, 2010, and in reply to the Respondent's submissions, dated October 24, 2010 in summary, are as follows:\nThe Tribunal has the discretion to amend a complaint to deal with additional grounds of discrimination and additional allegations provided that the substance of the original complaint is respected and that sufficient notice has been given to the Respondent to enable it to properly defend itself. The Complainant is not adding any new events but is only adding grounds of discrimination to the original Complaint. The Commission was in error in advising the Complainant that her request for an amendment to the Complaint was untimely. The substance of the original Complaint is being respected as the additional grounds can be derived from information that was provided by the Complainant in her job application and from the original Complaint. The Respondent is not prejudiced by the proposed additional grounds of discrimination.\nThe Complainant withdrew ethnic origin as an additional ground in her reply to the Respondent's submissions.\n[16] The Respondent's submissions dated October 15, 2010, in reply to the Complainant's motion, in summary, are as follows:\nThe proposed amendment does not disclose the substance of the allegations. The Tribunal's jurisdiction does not permit it to consider new complaints. The amendment fundamentally alters the allegations and constitutes a new complaint. The purpose of adding new allegations is not fulfilled in the present case. Allowing the amendment would prejudice the Respondent.\n[17] The facts set out in the original Complaint are summarized in paragraph 9 herein. These are the facts that were investigated and reported on by the Commission that gave rise to the referral by the Commission to this Tribunal for an inquiry as described in paragraph 13 herein. It is not possible, in my view, to derive any logical connection or nexus from these facts to the allegations of the additional prohibited grounds of discrimination and the additional discriminatory practice proposed by the Complainant to be added by this motion, as described in the Amended Complaint in paragraph 10 herein and the Notice of Motion in paragraph 14 herein. Without such a connection or nexus, there is no statutory authority for the referral to occur under paragraph 44 (3) (a) of the CHRA with respect to the proposed amendment, since that is how the Tribunal obtains jurisdiction for the inquiry. Where a proposed new ground is no mere amendment but in fact is a substantially new Complaint, as in my view is the case here, the Commission cannot be said to have requested the inquiry and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to proceed. Canada (Attorney General) v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), [1991] F.C.J. No. 334 [Q.L.], 43 F.T.R.\nFor this reason, the Tribunal has correctly established the following limitation on amendments:\nThe Commission must have considered the essential situation that forms the subject-matter of the inquiry, when it referred the Complaint to the Tribunal. This places certain limits on amendments, which must have their pedigree in the circumstances that were put before the Commission. Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1\n[18] A Complaint will be considered new were it bears no factual, logical or other connection with the original Complaint as is the case here with respect to the proposed amendment. As the proposed amendment introduces a new Complaint that was neither considered by the Commission nor referred to the Tribunal it exceeds the Tribunal's jurisdiction and must be denied.\n[19] For these reasons, the motion to amend is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Canada International Development Agency and Health Canada; and Jonathon Wheatcroft v. Canada International Development Agency.\n[2] The complainant Ms. Cruden filed two complaints with the Commission on November 8, 2008, on the ground of disability, alleging that Health Canada engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA) and that CIDA engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA. On April 26, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3) (a) of the CHRA, the Commission requested the Tribunal to inquire into both complaints. The complainant Mr. Wheatcroft filed a complaint with the Commission on February 9, 2009 on the ground of disability, alleging that CIDA had engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of ss. 7 and 10 of the CHRA. On April 27, 2010, pursuant to paragraph 44(3) (a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Commission requested the Tribunal to inquire into the complaint. The Commission will participate fully in both the Cruden and Wheatcroft hearings. On October 21, 2010, the respondent CIDA made a request to the Tribunal to join or consolidate the inquiries in the two cases. Both complainants oppose the consolidation of their cases.\n[3] On October 21, 2010, Shirish P. Chotalia, Q.C., the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, determined that this request would be dealt with through written arguments. The undersigned was designated to decide the present request.\n[4] The respondent\u2019s position in sum is as follows:\nThe Tribunal may institute a single inquiry into several complaints which involve substantially the same issues of fact and law. The complaints have common factual and legal issues and the vast majority of the evidence will come from the respondent. The single inquiry will avoid the possibility of inconsistent decisions, will be more efficient and will result in the respondent, the Commission and the Tribunal incurring lower costs than they would for two hearings. It is in the best interests of the respondent\u2019s witnesses, as public servants to testify in one hearing instead of two, and it is also in the public\u2019s best interest to avoid multiplicity of proceedings. While Ms. Cruden, who is pregnant, has valid reasons for wishing her complaint to be heard before she gives birth, the prejudice to the respondent in not consolidating the hearings outweighs any prejudice resulting from what would amount to a 90-day postponement of her hearing dates.\nAnalysis [5] The two issues before me are as follows:\n[6] First, as a Tribunal member of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, do I have the discretion to deal with the two cases together, and secondly, if so, is a joint hearing appropriate in these particular circumstances?\n[7] Concerning the first issue, in considering whether or not I have the discretion to join the cases, it is helpful to examine the relevant provisions of the CHRA.\n[8] Section 40(4) specifically addresses the ability of the Commission to deal with complaints filed by different complainants against the same respondent together, where the Commission is satisfied that the complaints involve substantially the same issues of fact and law. In such cases, it is also open to the Commission to request that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute a single inquiry into the complaints.\n[9] In the present case, the Commission did not make use of s. 40(4) of the CHRA to deal with the complaints of Ms. Cruden and Mr. Wheatcroft together, or to request a single inquiry at the time the complaints were referred to the Tribunal, even though the referral dates of the complaints are one day apart: Ms. Cruden\u2019s complaint was referred on April 26, 2010 and Mr. Wheatcroft\u2019s complaint was referred on April 27, 2010. The Commission did however indicate in their written arguments that they were in agreement with CIDA\u2019s motion to consolidate both cases.\n[10] In the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Lattey v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 2002 CanLII 45928 (C.H.R.T.), I find the words of former Chairperson, Anne Mactavish, to be instructive:\n[12] In contrast to the specific guidance provided by the Act with respect to the Commission's ability to deal with cases together, the Act is silent as to the power of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal to join or sever complaints before it. In my view, the issue of whether to hold a single hearing or multiple hearings is a procedural matter. In the absence of specific statutory direction, the Tribunal is master of its own procedure. [footnotes omitted]\n[11] In view of the above, I am satisfied in regard to the first issue that I have the discretion to determine whether or not a single inquiry should be instituted into these complaints.\n[12] Turning to the second issue, I must now consider if it is appropriate to join the two cases together.\n[13] I carefully reviewed all the materials put before me and considered the case law presented by all parties.\n[14] The ruling in Lattey is also instructive in its identification of the factors to consider in determining whether or not the cases should be heard together, namely:\nThe public interest in avoiding a multiplicity of proceedings, including considerations of expense, delay, the convenience of the witnesses, reducing the need for the repetition of evidence, and the risk of inconsistent results; The potential prejudice to the respondent [in this case\u2014the complainants\u2014who oppose the consolidation] that could result from a single hearing, including the lengthening of the hearing for each respondent as issues unique to the other respondent are dealt with, and the potential for confusion that may result from the introduction of evidence that may not relate to the allegations specifically involving one respondent or the other; and Whether there are common issues of fact or law.\n[15] Even if the Lattey principles are instructive, I note that former Chairperson Mactavish did not stipulate in her ruling that her enumeration of relevant factors was an exhaustive list. Moreover, factual distinctions between the Lattey matter and the matter before me cannot be overlooked. The former Chairperson in Latttey was not confronted, as I am, with two separate complainants who are at very different stages of the proceedings before the Tribunal, and who oppose the joint hearing of their cases.\n[16] As I feel it is an additional relevant factor in my analysis, I will elaborate on the issue of each case\u2019s stage in the Tribunal proceedings, and related considerations: Ms Cruden has already filed all her materials at the Tribunal; she is ready to proceed with her case and hearing dates are to commence as early as January 17, 2011. She is hoping to finish the hearing before she gives birth to her child since she is due in February 2011. In the Wheatcroft case, the respondent has yet to file its Statement of Particulars, which are only due on December 20, 2010. Even though the most important prejudice would be suffered by Mrs. Cruden if the cases are joined, Mr. Wheatcroft who opposes the joining of the cases will not have to suffer any prejudice if the cases are heard separately.\n[17] If the motion is allowed and, the solution put forward by the respondent is authorized, this will inevitably split the hearing in two because of Ms. Cruden\u2019s delivery date; it will postpone the hearing of part of her case until she has given birth or delay her hearing thereby creating additional hardships for her. Given the foregoing, I do not see how the request from the respondent adequately addresses the efficiency of the hearing. This issue must be considered in light of the public interest in having complaints of discrimination dealt with expeditiously (Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada et al., (1997) F.C.J. No. 207 (F.C.T.D.); see also CHRA s. 48.9(1)). This brings me to the timeliness of the respondent\u2019s request. While the cases were referred for inquiry in April of 2010, the request to join the two cases together was not made until late October. The respondent did not satisfy me as to why their request was made at this stage of the proceedings and not earlier. Proceeding the way the respondent is asking to, adds complexity to the hearing process and does not sufficiently address the prejudice caused to the complainants, who oppose the request.\n[18] I acknowledge the fact that there might be some overlapping evidence to be adduced in the two cases on behalf of the respondent, and that most of the respondent\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony in chief in the first case will be repeated in the subsequent case. However, this repetition could potentially be minimized with a future request to file with the Tribunal in the second hearing transcripts of testimony in chief given during the first hearing. (Of course, such a request would have to be considered on its merits by the presiding member of the second hearing, presumably after receiving submissions from all parties).\n[19] As an additional observation, while I acknowledge that it is not desirable for the Tribunal to render inconsistent or contradictory decisions dealing with the same issue, I would note that an order joining the Cruden and Wheatcroft proceedings may not be the only available means of preventing such inconsistency. Indeed, the need to prevent inconsistent results formed part of the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of the doctrine of abuse of process in Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77.\n[20] Ultimately, the inefficiencies that may result from the cases being heard separately are outweighed by the prejudice Ms. Cruden would incur if her complaints are not dealt with in accordance with the established schedule.\n[21] My ruling might have been different if the two cases where at the same stage of pre-hearing disclosure and hearing readiness. I emphasize the importance of a case by case approach.\n[22] The exercise of the Tribunal's discretion is subject to the rules of natural justice, and the regime of the CHRA. It has not been shown how the result sought by the respondent better accords with natural justice, nor how it better advances the legislative objectives of the inquiry process, in particular, expeditiousness, and the granting to all parties of a full and ample opportunity to participate (CHRA s. 50(1)).\n[23] For all of the above reasons the respondent\u2019s request to consolidate the cases is denied.\nSigned by\nSophie Marchildon Administrative Judge\nOTTAWA, Ontario December 10, 2010\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T1466\/1210 and T1471\/1710\nStyle of Cause:\nBronwyn Cruden v.

Order\n[1] The Complainant, Peter M. Collins, is an inmate incarcerated at the Bath Institution (the Institution), located near Kingston, Ontario. The Institution is a medium security penitentiary operated by the Respondent, the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC). Mr. Collins suffers from chronic and severe back pain that limits his mobility. The CSC has a policy of requiring inmates to stand up and be counted by correctional officers at least once a day, known as the stand-to count procedure. Mr. Collins sought an exemption from the requirement to stand due to the pain associated with his disability. He alleges in his complaint that this accommodation was denied, and that he was therefore discriminated against in the provision of services customarily available to the general public, within the meaning of s. 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\n[2] Several weeks before the start of the hearing into the complaint, the CSC admitted that Mr. Collins has a disability, which it had failed to accommodate during the performance of the stand-to count procedure. At the hearing, the CSC advised the Tribunal that a medical exemption had recently been granted to Mr. Collins as a result of which he would no longer be required to stand and be counted.\n[3] Mr. Collins acknowledged that the measures to accommodate his disability had indeed been implemented. This accommodation was one of the remedies he had been seeking. The hearing proceeded, nonetheless, in order to deal with the remaining claimed remedies under the CHRA, namely damages for pain and suffering (s. 53(2)(e)) and special compensation (s. 53(3)).\nI. FACTS A. Mr. Collins\u2019 disability [4] When Mr. Collins was a young man, he was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, badly damaging his spine. He testified that in subsequent years, he was involved in other motor vehicle accidents that caused further damage to his spine. As a result, he developed back and neck pain that has increased over time. His mobility has correspondingly decreased. Among his medically identified ailments today are herniated discs and narrowed nerve canals. Although in constant pain, he is able to stand up and walk. The act of rising from a lying or seated position itself can be particularly painful, however. The hearing into the present complaint had to be adjourned on one occasion because the pain Mr. Collins was experiencing that day was so great, he was unable to get out of bed and walk to the Institution\u2019s chapel where the proceedings were being held.\n[5] Mr. Collins has been incarcerated in institutions operated by the CSC since about 1982. Over that period, the CSC enabled him to be treated by several physicians, including a number of specialists. The CSC also provided him with a variety of assistance devices to help him deal with his pain, such as supportive mattresses, special chairs and desks, heating and massaging pads, as well as neck and back braces. In addition, the CSC assigned him certain forms of inmate jobs that he could accomplish despite his disability.\nB. The Stand-to count procedure [6] Mr. Collins\u2019 complaint relates to a CSC policy requiring inmates to stand and be counted by correctional officers. According to Ian Chinnery, who for a time managed the unit in which Mr. Collins was incarcerated, this procedure was initiated pursuant to a directive from the Commissioner of the CSC (CD-566-4), which stated that at least one stand-to count must be conducted every day in all CSC institutions and community correctional centres.\n[7] Mr. Chinnery testified that the policy of requiring the stand-to count was adopted as a result of several unfortunate incidents where correctional officers had verified the presence of inmates in their cells without noticing that the inmates were sick, injured or even deceased. This oversight could have been avoided had all inmates been required to stand and be counted.\n[8] The objective of the stand-to count was therefore the establishment of a standard for conducting inmate counts so as to monitor their whereabouts at all times and ensure the presence of a live, breathing body during counts, as stated in the pre-August 2006 version of the directive. The stand-to count was defined as one during which the inmate was required to be in a standing position, either inside or outside the inmate\u2019s cell or bed location. As explained later in this decision, this definition was modified in a subsequent version of CD-566-4, issued on August 8, 2006.\n[9] Mr. Collins testified that although the Institution was implementing the directive and conducting a stand-to count every day, the correctional officers of the CSC were not requiring him to rise, due to his disability. While there was no formal directive or policy adopted that he be exempt from the procedure, the CSC was effectively accommodating him. Mr. Collins claims that this practice suddenly ceased on November 30, 2005, when one of the CSC\u2019s correctional officers ordered him for the first time to stand and be counted in an unsupported manner (i.e., without being able to lean on an object for assistance). Mr. Collins informed the correctional officer that he was medically incapable of standing at the time. She advised him to get an exemption from the stand-to count procedure from the Institution\u2019s warden, failing which he risked being charged with a disciplinary offence whenever he did not rise for the count.\n[10] Mr. Collins explained in his testimony that the presence of charges on an inmate\u2019s security file, whether or not they are ultimately upheld, can have a significant impact on the inmate. For instance, they could affect the inmate\u2019s security rating thereby preventing him from gaining access to a lower security penitentiary. They could even lead to the inmate being sent to a higher security institution. Privileges could also be denied to him, and his chances to gain approval for parole may also be affected.\n[11] Unwilling, therefore, to risk having charges laid against him, Mr. Collins immediately set upon requesting an exemption from the Institution\u2019s warden. On the same day as his exchange with the correctional officer (November 30, 2005), he sent a letter to the warden explaining the incident and expressing his concern that charges would be laid against him. According to Mr. Collins, the warden advised him to seek a medical recommendation from the Institution\u2019s physician. Mr. Collins followed this advice and sought an appointment with the physician.\n[12] On December 21, 2005, the Institution\u2019s Chief of Health Services, Brian Blasko, learned from another staff member of the Institution, that Mr. Collins intended to seek a medical exemption from the stand-to count procedure. Mr. Blasko is a registered nurse, and he had begun serving as the Institution\u2019s Chief of Health Services two months earlier. His duties included managing the Institution\u2019s clinic and ensuring that essential patient care was provided to inmates. He coordinated and oversaw the Institution\u2019s contracts with medical and dental professionals for the provision of services to the inmates. He testified that his duties included ensuring that medical recommendations comply with CSC policies.\n[13] Upon learning of Mr. Collins' intention, Mr. Blasko wrote an email back to the same staff member, on December 22, 2005, in which he stated that he saw no reason why Mr. Collins could not stand for a few seconds to be counted. Mr. Blasko added that if Mr. Collins required a cane or other device to do so, he could request it from the Institution\u2019s health services office.\n[14] Meanwhile, on December 27, 2005, following up on the warden\u2019s advice, Mr. Collins met with Dr. Diana Wyatt, a physician in family medicine. Her practice consists exclusively of providing medical services to inmates in a number of CSC institutions. She is not, however, an employee of the CSC. The CSC engages her services as a contractor.\n[15] Dr. Wyatt testified that during her meeting with Mr. Collins, he mentioned that he was seeking a medical recommendation regarding whether he should be required to stand during the stand-to count procedure. Her medical opinion was that it would be simpler if he were not required to stand. She wrote a note to this effect in Mr. Collins\u2019 medical chart. An additional entry was placed in the chart to indicate that the Institution\u2019s Chief of Health Services (Mr. Blasko) would address the issue. Dr. Wyatt explained in her evidence that it is a common practice for her to assign the implementation of her recommendations to the Chief of Health Services.\n[16] According to Mr. Collins, it was his understanding from his meeting with Dr. Wyatt that she would be making a written recommendation for his exemption from having to stand.\n[17] Mr. Blasko saw Dr. Wyatt\u2019s note in Mr. Collins\u2019 medical chart a few days later. Mr. Blasko understood from his knowledge of Mr. Collins\u2019 medical file that he was not confined to a wheelchair nor paralyzed, and was fairly ambulatory. Mindful of the CD-566-4 directive\u2019s requirements, he decided to speak to Dr. Wyatt about the matter. Dr. Wyatt testified that she is not familiar with commissioner\u2019s directives nor did she receive any training regarding them. She had no prior knowledge of the stand-to count procedure at all.\n[18] Mr. Blasko explained the stand-to count policy to her and its stated objective of protecting inmates\u2019 health and safety. He asked her if it would be acceptable for Mr. Collins to be required to stand while leaning on a wall or chair. According to Mr. Blasko, she agreed this requirement would not pose a problem for Mr. Collins.\n[19] Thus, on January 11, 2006, the deputy warden formally replied to the Mr. Collins\u2019 request for a medical exemption, by stating that the Institution\u2019s Health Care Services unit had confirmed that there was no medical reason that he could not stand unaided for a few seconds during the count. Nevertheless, on January 13, 2006, the health care services unit issued a written recommendation, allowing Mr. Collins to use the aid of an object when standing up for prolonged periods of time, such as a wall or desk.\n[20] The recommendation was handwritten by Mr. Blasko. He wrote in Dr. Wyatt\u2019s name at the bottom in block letters over a line marked physician. He placed his own signature over the part of the line marked nurse. Dr. Wyatt explained that it is a common practice for her and other physicians to give instructions or recommendations to a nurse who in turn writes them out, particularly when she gets called away on some other matter and does not have the time to complete and sign the recommendation herself.\n[21] Mr. Blasko testified that he felt it was important that there exist a document confirming that Mr. Collins was allowed to stand while supported against a wall or chair. If not, the correctional officers conducting the counts could have incorrectly assumed from his leaning on objects for support, that he was injured and therefore unable to stand unassisted. Mr. Blasko indicated in his evidence that he considered the authorization for Mr. Collins to use a support when he stands, to be a form of accommodation.\n[22] The evidence is unclear on whether Mr. Collins was required to stand and be counted in the immediately ensuing weeks, but on February 7, 2006, Mr. Collins had another appointment with Dr. Wyatt. She testified that he told her that even standing with the support of a wall was a problem for him, since he sometimes needed to stand while all the inmates were counted, a period that could last from 20 to 30 minutes. Dr. Wyatt stated that standing for that long, even while supported, would be extremely painful.\n[23] Dr. Wyatt testified that at this time, she was still unfamiliar with the specific details of how the stand-to count was conducted, so based on Mr. Collins account, she changed her recommendation and wrote out a new note addressed to Mr. Collin\u2019s unit manager (Mr. Chinnery) stating:\nThe following recommendation has been made:\nThere may be occasional times due to medical limitation when this inmate may need to lie, sit or stand supported for stand up count.\n[24] After receiving Dr. Wyatt\u2019s memo, Mr. Chinnery spoke to Mr. Blasko about it. They felt that the recommendation gave rise to some ambiguity.\n[25] Consequently, on February 14, 2006, after receiving Dr. Wyatt\u2019s note, Mr. Chinnery sent a memo to her in reply, expressing concern about her recommendation, namely because it suggested Mr. Collins could decide at his discretion whether or not he could stand for the count. According to Mr. Chinnery, the recommendation made it difficult for the Institution to apply the CD-566-4 directive. He pointed out that her medical recommendations were subject to any CSC security requirements, and the stand-to count was one such requirement. Her recommendation was therefore simply [\u2026] not in compliance CSC directives. Mr. Chinnery suggested that if Mr. Collins was at any time unable to stand, he could request medical intervention at that time and be taken to the clinic for diagnosis and treatment.\n[26] Mr. Chinnery therefore prepared a memo for Dr. Wyatt, asking that she reconsider and amend her recommendation to no longer state that Mr. Collins may need to lie or sit, but rather that he may on occasion need to stand supported.\n[27] Before forwarding the memo to Dr. Wyatt, Mr. Chinnery sent a draft, as an email attachment, to the Institution\u2019s Deputy Warden, seeking his comments and approval. In the accompanying email, Mr. Chinnery wrote that he would appreciate a quick response so that Collins doesn\u2019t start playing games at count time. Mr. Chinnery explained in his evidence that he meant if Mr. Collins were to stand on one occasion and not another, it could elicit charges from, or potential confrontation with, correctional officers. Mr. Chinnery was convinced that applying Dr. Wyatt\u2019s recommendation would have been very disruptive to the unit in which Mr. Collins was incarcerated.\n[28] After receiving Mr. Chinnery\u2019s memo, Dr. Wyatt had a conversation with Mr. Blasko. She testified that he provided her with two new details of which she had previously been unaware. First, that in fact, Mr. Collins and the other inmates were not required to stand for 20 minutes as he had suggested, but rather for no more than two minutes. Second, the stand-to count procedure was implemented as a measure to protect the health and safety of inmates, after an incident in another institution where an inmate who was ill was counted without the correctional officers realizing that he was in need of urgent medical care.\n[29] After this conversation, Dr. Wyatt booked another medical appointment with Mr. Collins. They met on March 2, 2006, during which Dr.Wyatt informed him that she was readjusting her recommendation to state the following:\nThere may be times that Mr. Collins\u2019 back does make standing or even sitting difficult. However, I am aware that security must come first and therefore Mr. Collins is aware that at present, he does need to stand in some fashion for count.\n[30] Dr. Wyatt testified that she was not forced by anyone to change her recommendation, and she was comfortable making it. She recalls Mr. Collins reiterating that he needed to stand for the entire duration of the count, but she replied that it was her understanding now that he stood for a short time only. Both she and Mr. Blasko, who was also present at this meeting, testified that Mr. Collins did not otherwise react, in a positive or negative way, to this information.\n[31] Dr. Wyatt met with Mr. Collins again at a scheduled medical visit, on May 23, 2006. She testified that although the discussion centred principally on his pain management, he also asked her to change her recommendation about the stand-to count. She refused.\nC. Charges were laid on two occasions [32] According to the evidence before the Tribunal, charges were laid against Mr. Collins for failing to stand on only two occasions, on May 28, 2007, and on November 19, 2007. The outcomes regarding these charges were not placed in evidence.\nD. Mr. Collins files grievance complaints [33] Pursuant to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c.20, the CSC provides a redress procedure for offenders. On April 25, 2006, Mr. Collins filed a complaint under this procedure, alleging that Mr. Chinnery had wrongly interfered with Dr. Wyatt\u2019s medical recommendations. His complaint was denied. Dissatisfied with this outcome, Mr. Collins filed a first level (institutional level) grievance on May 23, 2006, in accordance with the designated procedure. He alleged that Mr. Chinnery was biased against him and had acted in a retributive capacity, which was deliberately designed to inflict pain and suffering on him.\n[34] On June 12, 2006, the Institution\u2019s deputy warden denied the grievance, finding that Mr. Chinnery acted properly. Mr. Collins therefore filed a second level (regional) grievance on June 20, 2006. He reiterated his allegation that Mr. Chinnery was intent on causing pain and suffering. This grievance was also denied in a decision dated April 3, 2007, which noted that Mr. Chinnery had acted properly in advising Dr. Wyatt of her initial recommendation\u2019s conflict with the stand-to count policy.\n[35] Mr. Collins filed a third level (national) grievance following this decision, in which he not only restated his prior allegations against Mr. Chinnery, but also complained about the length of time the decision had taken to be issued. Mr. Collins noted in the grievance that Mr. Chinnery was at that time working at the Offender Redress division at the Regional Headquarters, from where the decision had been issued. Mr. Chinnery testified that in 2006 and 2007, he had served on secondment at the Offender Redress divisions at both Regional and National Headquarters of the CSC. He stated, however, that he never served as an analyst on any of Mr. Collins\u2019 grievances.\n[36] The national and final level decision found that Mr. Chinnery\u2019s memo to Dr. Wyatt could not be interpreted as an attempt at malicious interference or harassment, and this part of the grievance was therefore denied. However, it was also noted that due to the delays attributed to a backlog of grievances being handled at the regional level, Mr. Collins was not provided with a response within the appropriate time frame. That part of his grievance was therefore upheld. Mr. Chinnery confirmed in his testimony that there were huge delays at the time processing all grievances at Ontario\u2019s Regional Headquarters. One of the reasons why he was asked to work in the Offender Redress division was to help clear this backlog.\nE. Changes to the CD-566-4 directive [37] At the time when Mr. Collins first began being required to stand during the count, in November 2005, the CD-566-4 directive defined the stand-to count as a count during which the inmate is required to be in a standing position, either inside or outside the inmate\u2019s cell or bed location. There was no provision in the directive for dealing with individuals whose disabilities may prevent them from standing.\n[38] The CD-566-4 directive was amended, however, on August 8, 2006, and now included a modified definition of the stand-to count, which provided for the possibility that an inmate may be prevented from standing due to medical or physical restrictions:\nStand-to count: A formal count of inmates in a standing position, facing the counting staff member to ensure facial identification is made except in cases where exemptions for medical conditions or physical limitations have been identified.\n[39] The directive also now described an alternate method by which these exempt inmates could be counted:\nInmates with medical conditions or physical limitations, deemed by the Chief of Health Services (or equivalent) as unable to respond to or perform a stand-to-count request, are exempt from this requirement. In such cases, inmates must be awake and signal the staff member through an alternative means, normally a hand signal.\n[40] The amendment to the directive had no impact on Mr. Collins, however, until a short time prior to the hearing when, as mentioned earlier, the CSC conceded that he was disabled. He obtained a medical exemption and has been accommodated in accordance with the directive.\nF. Mr. Collins\u2019 interaction with Mr. Chinnery and the administration of the CSC [41] Mr. Collins claims that the CSC, and Mr. Chinnery in particular, required him to stand as a wilful act of discrimination against him and his disability. As mentioned earlier, Mr. Collins had alleged in his grievance that Mr. Chinnery was biased against him and that he acted in a retributory manner. Mr. Collins objected to Mr. Chinnery\u2019s malicious interference in his efforts to obtain a medical exemption from the stand-to count. As also indicated earlier, Mr. Collins claims that this bias even extended to the processing of his grievance, since Mr. Chinnery was employed at the Officer Redress division for a period during which Mr. Collins grievance was being considered.\n[42] Mr. Collins testified that his dealings with CSC staff have been strained over the course of his incarceration. In 1994 when he was being held at the Joyceville correctional facility, for instance, he claims that he was denied privileges because he had accused a correctional officer of stealing from him. Mr. Collins also claims that a number of false accusations were made against him over the years, of which he was ultimately absolved. In the meantime, however, his complaints had come to be perceived negatively by the CSC staff who dealt with him on a daily basis. Mr. Blasko was employed at the Joyceville institution while Mr. Collins was there.\n[43] An additional strain between Mr. Collins and CSC personnel arose as a result of a series of controversial cartoons and other drawings that he created around 1998, which were shown at public exhibits and made some headlines in the press. Some of the drawings were critical of CSC staff and police authorities, which drew particular attention given that Mr. Collins is serving a sentence for the murder of a police officer.\n[44] Between 1999 and 2001, Mr. Chinnery was Mr. Collins\u2019 institutional parole officer at the Institution. Mr. Chinnery testified that when Mr. Collins arrived at the Institution, there were some concerns about his prior interactions with CSC staff, especially revolving around his cartoons and drawings. The warden was troubled about the negative depictions of police officers and the publicity they would attract to the Institution and Mr. Collins, given the crime for which he had been convicted. Mr. Chinnery acknowledged that during the period that he was Mr. Collins\u2019 parole officer, he was personally humiliated by one of Mr. Collins\u2019 drawings in particular, which he felt was an obvious depiction of him portrayed in a negative light. Mr. Chinnery categorically denies, however, having retaliated against Mr. Collins in any way, including in his involvement regarding the stand-to count issue.\n[45] Mr. Collins also contends that the CSC denied him the use of a walker to move around the Institution and he referred in his evidence to a statement that Mr. Chinnery had made in his memo to Dr. Wyatt of February 14, 2006, that he was making efforts to provide Mr. Collins with a TV stand, which would enable him to view the screen more comfortably. Mr. Collins claims that the TV stand was never in fact provided. He also argues that Mr. Blasko\u2019s decision to discuss Dr. Wyatt\u2019s medical recommendation with the warden and others constitutes an unauthorized disclosure of his personal information and thus a breach of the Privacy Act. Mr. Collins claims that these alleged acts demonstrate that Mr. Blasko has long term issues with him, dating back to the time when he was being incarcerated in the Joyceville institute at the same time as Mr. Blasko worked there.\n[46] Mr. Collins contends, therefore, that Mr. Chinnery\u2019s personal animosity towards him and his difficult relationship with Mr. Blasko and CSC staff in general, demonstrate that he was wilfully discriminated against on the basis of his disability.\nII. The complaint is substantiated [47] The CSC has admitted that Mr. Collins has a disability. On account of this disability, as Mr. Collins testified during the hearing, standing up to be counted causes him physical pain and discomfort. The CSC also conceded that until shortly before the start of the hearing, it had failed to accommodate Mr. Collins\u2019 disability during the performance of the stand-to count procedure. Mr. Collins alleges that this failure to accommodate constitutes adverse differentiation in the provision of a service customarily available to the public, on the basis of the prohibited ground of disability, pursuant to s. 5(b) of the CHRA. The CSC did not deny or refute this allegation.\n[48] In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds the complaint to be substantiated.\nIII. Remedies A. Compensation for pain and suffering (s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA [49] Section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA provides that if at the conclusion of an inquiry, the Tribunal finds that the complaint is substantiated, the Tribunal may order that the person found to have engaged in the discriminatory practice compensate the victim, by an amount up to $20,000, for any pain and suffering that the victim experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice. Mr. Collins is claiming the maximum of $20,000.\n[50] As a result of the CSC\u2019s failure to accommodate Mr. Collins\u2019 disability, he was required to rise for the stand-to count. The CSC claims that Mr. Collins is in chronic pain, due to his pre-existing back injuries, whether he stands or not. The CSC therefore argues that it should not be ordered to compensate him for his pain and suffering. I am persuaded by Mr. Collins\u2019 evidence, however, which was not in fact contradicted on this point, that the act of standing up causes him additional pain. It is this aggravation to his chronic pain that necessitated his accommodation. If the act of standing was of no consequence to him, Dr. Wyatt would not have made any entry in her chart or issued any of her recommendations. I am satisfied that requiring Mr. Collins to rise caused him additional pain to varying degrees, depending on his condition that day, than if he had remained seated or lying down.\n[51] I also accept Mr. Collins\u2019 evidence that he experienced some degree of anguish over the possibility that he would face charges or other retribution for failing to comply with the correctional officers\u2019 orders that he stand to be counted.\n[52] In the circumstances, I find that Mr. Collins is entitled to $7,000 in compensation for his pain and suffering, pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA.\nB. Special compensation (s. 53(3) of the CHRA) [53] Section 53(3) provides that the Tribunal may order a respondent to pay up to $20,000 in compensation to the victim, as the Tribunal may determine, if it is satisfied that the respondent engaged in the discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly. Mr. Collins is claiming the maximum amount of $20,000. As noted in Johnstone v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2010 CHRT 20 at para. 379, the maximum award under this heading is reserved for the very worst cases.\n[54] Mr. Collins alleges that the CSC engaged in the discriminatory practice against him both wilfully and recklessly.\n[55] An important consideration in determining whether the CSC was reckless in its discriminatory conduct centres on Messrs. Blasko\u2019s and Chinnery\u2019s interventions into the assessments by Mr. Collins\u2019 physician, Dr. Wyatt, with respect to his medical condition. In Mr. Blasko\u2019s view, Mr. Collins was fairly ambulatory and he believed that since Mr. Collins was not confined to a wheelchair or paralyzed, standing for the count would not be an issue. Mr. Chinnery believed that Dr. Wyatt\u2019s recommendation, although based on her medical expertise, made it difficult for the Institution to apply the CD-566-4 directive. In his view, the medical recommendation was simply not in compliance with the directives. This opinion failed to take into account, however, the fact that Mr. Collins was disabled and that, according to Dr. Wyatt, he required accommodation. The foremost concern for Mr. Chinnery was applying the directive properly, not accommodating Mr. Collins\u2019 disability.\n[56] The CSC points out that even if Messrs. Blasko\u2019s and Chinnery\u2019s motivation was to enforce the applicable directives, Dr. Wyatt, in her professional opinion, was comfortable with the changes proposed by the two CSC employees. As such, Mr. Collins did not need to be accommodated. This submission is inconsistent, however, with the CSC\u2019s admission (and ultimately, the Tribunal\u2019s finding) that it had failed to accommodate Mr. Collins and his disability. The physician\u2019s reversal on her recommendation is, on the evidence, entirely explicable. As Mr. Collins points out, while Dr. Wyatt was not formally an employee, at the relevant times, she was essentially working for the CSC exclusively. Having no personal prior knowledge of the commissioner\u2019s directive relating the stand-to count procedure, she demonstrated a high degree of deference to the information and advice provided to her by CSC staff, i.e. Messrs. Blasko and Chinnery.\n[57] It is therefore clear that the CSC\u2019s employees, Messrs. Blasko and Chinnery, endeavoured to set aside the initial medical recommendation of Mr. Collins\u2019 physician and replace it with conditions that would conform to the directive. The CSC points out that this matter arises in the unique context of a medium security correctional facility and that other issues are in play than those that normally arise in more typical accommodation cases. However, the CSC did not lead evidence or argue that there was a bona fide justification for the adverse differentiation in treatment of Mr. Collins pursuant to s. 15(1)(g) of the CHRA. Nor did the CSC, to that end, contend that accommodating him would have imposed undue hardship on the CSC, within the meaning of s. 15(2). Moreover, I note that the CD-566-4 directive itself was later amended to specify that an inmate can be exempt from being required to stand for the count for medical reasons. Thus, even the CSC ultimately recognized formally the reasonableness of the form of accommodation Mr. Collins was seeking.\n[58] Taking all of these circumstances into account, I find that Messrs. Blasko and Chinnery did not sufficiently consider the potential physical pain that could be caused to Mr. Collins by endeavouring and succeeding in reversing Dr. Wyatt\u2019s initial recommendations. Instead, they drew their own conclusions about his ability to stand for the count, and successfully worked towards having her change her opinion. As such, they disregarded Mr. Collins\u2019 request and need for accommodation, in pursuit of maintaining the CSC\u2019s stand-to count policy. These CSC employees should have known that to act accordingly would constitute a discriminatory practice. It was reckless of them to have proceeded nonetheless.\n[59] On the other hand, I am not persuaded that the discriminatory practice was intentional. While there is some indication in the evidence that Mr. Chinnery was not particularly pleased with some of Mr. Collins\u2019 activities (particularly in relation to his cartoons), and that CSC employees have over the years occasionally viewed Mr. Collins as a difficult inmate, the evidence is not sufficient to support a finding that the CSC or its staff intentionally engaged in the discriminatory practice against Mr. Collins. His allegation that Mr. Chinnery was motivated by a desire to personally decide when Mr. Collins would stand and cause him additional pain is completely unfounded. There is no reason to doubt Mr. Chinnery\u2019s testimony that his sole intention at all relevant times was to apply the CSC\u2019s directives. I also do not find any merit in Mr. Collins\u2019 suspicions that Mr. Chinnery somehow had a hand in the grievance proceedings or in the delays that were apparently endemic to the process in all cases, not just Mr. Collins\u2019.\n[60] In the circumstances, I find that an award of $2,500 in special compensation, pursuant to s. 53(3) of the CHRA, is appropriate.\nC. Other remedies [61] In his final submissions, Mr. Collins requested a series of additional remedies. These items include that the CSC be compelled to provide seating in the visiting, correspondence, and library areas of the Institution, and that safety hand holds be added in the toilet and shower areas. There was no evidence led in relation to any of these claims. In addition, Mr. Collins asked to be provided with a walker. While there was some mention in the evidence about his requests for this mobility aid, it was entirely collateral to the issues of the case and was, in any event, insufficient to support any finding in this regard.\n[62] Finally, Mr. Collins asked that the CSC should be compelled to ensure against surreptitious or direct reprisal activities. Mr. Collins indicated in his evidence that ever since the CSC has begun formally accommodating him during the stand-to count procedure, he has sensed that some CSC correctional officers somehow feel diminished, prompting them to make certain comments about him. He expressed the hope that these remarks would cease. This evidence does not justify the issuance of an order as requested by Mr. Collins in his final submissions. The present decision should provide all parties with ample and sufficient guidance on how to conduct them regarding the issues of this case. Should anyone engage in any forms of retaliation or intimidation within the meanings of ss. 14.1 and 59 of the CHRA, a separate recourse may be available under these provisions.\n[63] For these reasons, Mr. Collins\u2019 request for these additional remedies is denied.\nIV. Order [64] The Tribunal orders the CSC to pay Mr. Collins the sum of $7,500 as damages for pain and suffering pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA and the sum of $5,000 as special compensation pursuant to s. 53(3).\nSigned by\nAthanasios D.

Extracts from the Decision of the Tribunal\nV. Reconsideration.\nI. Introduction [1] On April 16, 2008, Tribunal Member Karen A. Jensen rendered a decision in Tahmourpour v. Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) that a complaint of discrimination had been substantiated.\n[2] The Federal Court reversed Member Jensen\u2019s decision, however it was restored by the Federal Court of Appeal with one exception, remedial order (iv), set out below, which the Federal Court of Appeal required the Tribunal to reconsider.\n[3] The Tribunal Chair asked Ms. Jensen to undertake reconsideration of the remedial order but she respectfully declined, and the Tribunal Chair then assigned the matter to me.\nII. Summary of the Proceedings [4] On March 21, 2001, Mr. Ali Tahmourpour filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), alleging violations of sections 7 and 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6. Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s complaint led to a hearing before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) in August and September of 2007. In a decision dated April 16, 2008, Member Jensen concluded that the complaint was substantiated in a number of respects. Pursuant to s. 53(2) of the Act, Member Jensen made the following remedial orders:\nUnless otherwise agreed upon, the Respondent shall offer Mr. Tahmourpour an opportunity to re-enrol in the next available RCMP Cadet Training Program at Depot; If Mr. Tahmourpour accepts the offer of re-enrolment, the Respondent shall undertake a fair assessment of his skills at the outset of the training program to determine the areas in which training is needed; The Respondent shall pay Mr. Tahmoupour compensation for salary and benefits he lost for the first 2 years plus 12 weeks of work as an RCMP officer after graduating from the Depot. The compensation shall be discounted by 8%; The Respondent shall pay Mr Tahmourpour the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age, and the salary that he would have earned as an RCMP officer until such time as Mr. Tahmourpour accepts or rejects an offer of re-enrolment in the training program at Depot. The Respondent shall compensate Mr. Tahmourpour for the average amount of overtime paid to other constables who graduated from Depot in 1999, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The compensation shall be discounted by 8%; The compensation must reflect a promotion to Corporal after 7 years; The parties shall attempt to agree upon the measures and a timetable for addressing the issues set out in the Systemic Remedy part of this decision. In the event that they are unable to reach an agreement on this portion of the award within 3 months from the date of this decision, the Tribunal will make a final determination; The Respondent shall pay $9,000 to Mr Tahmourpour in compensation for the pain and suffering caused by its discriminatory conduct; The Respondent shall pay $12,000 to Mr Tahmourpourpursuant to s. 53(3) of the Act; The Respondent shall pay $9,500 to Mr. Tahmourpour in compensation for the expenses he incurred in minimizing his losses. The Respondent shall also compensate Mr. Tahmourpour for the legal expenses he incurred in this matter; The Respondent shall pay interest on the compensation awarded in this decision as set out above.\n[5] The RCMP applied to the Federal Court for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal, and on October 6, 2009, the Federal Court set aside the decision and referred the complaint back to the Tribunal for rehearing by a different member (2009 FC 1009). Mr. Tahmourpour appealed the judgment of the Federal Court, and on July 19, 2010, the Federal Court of Appeal restored the decision of the Tribunal on all issues but one, remedial order (iv), which awards financial compensation for future wage loss:\nThe appeal is allowed except on the question of the cap or limitation on the top-up portion of the compensation award. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the judgment of the Federal Court are set aside and replaced with the following;\n2. The application for judicial review is allowed only in respect of the first sentence of item (iv) of paragraph 267 of the decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal made April 16, 2008, and is otherwise dismissed.\n3. This matter is referred back to the Tribunal for reconsideration of the first sentence of item (iv) of paragraph 267 in accordance with the reasons for judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in A-453-09.\nIII. Extracts from Previous Proceedings [6] The following extracts from the reasons for judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal and the judicial review in the Federal Court are pertinent to a proper reconsideration of this matter.\nThe Federal Court of Appeal\n[40] The relevant part of the Tribunal award reads as follows (from paragraph 267 of the Tribunal\u2019s decision):\n(iii) the Respondent shall pay Mr. Tahmourpour compensation for salary and benefits he lost for the first 2 years plus 12 weeks of work as an RCMP officer after graduating from Depot. The compensation shall be discounted by 8%.\n(iv) the Respondent shall pay Mr. Tahmourpour the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age, and the salary that he would have earned as an RCMP officer until such time as Mr. Tahmourpour accepts or rejects an offer of re-enrolment in the training program at Depot. \u2026\n[41] As I understand this part of the award, it establishes two different time periods for the purpose of monetary compensation. The first time period, which the parties sometimes refer to as the grace period, runs for 2 years and 12 weeks starting with the date on which Mr. Tahmourpour would have graduated from the Depot but for his termination. For the grace period, Mr. Tahmourpour was held to be entitled to an amount equal to the compensation he would have received as an RCMP officer less 8%.\n[42] The second time period begins immediately after the grace period and ends on the date on which Mr Tahmourpour accepts or rejects an offer of re-enrolment. During that second time period, Mr Tahmourpour is entitled to further compensation, which I will call the top-up, determined as the difference between what he would have earned during the second time period if he had been employed at the average full-time industrial wage in Canada and the amount he would have earned during the second time period as an RCMP officer, with the difference discounted by 8%.\n[43] The end date of the second time period necessarily would occur at some time after the date of the Tribunal award on April 16, 2008. That means that the second time period would run for at least 6 years (i.e. from some time in 2002 until at least April 16, 2008).\n[44] It is not clear from the record whether the second time period has ended, or when it is likely to end. If this part of the remedy is read literally and Mr. Tahmourpour simply declines to accept or reject an offer of re-enrolment, the second time period may never end unless, as counsel suggested at the hearing of this appeal, the offer of re-enrolment is made subject to a condition that it must be accepted within a stipulated time or be deemed to have been rejected.\n[45] The RCMP argued in the Federal Court, and the judge agreed, that the top-up portion of the award of compensation is not consistent with the principle that the Tribunal must find a causal link between the discriminatory practice and the loss claimed (see Chopra v. Canada(Attorney General) (F.C.A.), 2007 FCA 268).\n[46] It is clear that the Tribunal was aware of Chopra and the principles relating to damages as stated in that case. In that regard, the Tribunal made a number of factual findings which I summarize as follows:\nThe RCMP\u2019s discriminatory treatment of Mr. Tahmoupour denied him the opportunity to complete his training at the Depot and to make his living as an RCMP officer. He must be compensated for the loss of wages that he would have earned. Non-visible minority cadets had a 93% chance of completing training. That justifies some discount from the compensation to be awarded (justifying a 7% discount). A further 1% discount is warranted because the average rate of attrition for regular members during the first 20 years of employment is 1%. No discount is warranted to reflect the chance that Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s demonstrated weaknesses increased the likelihood that he would not graduate, because it is not possible to know to what extent his weaknesses were caused by discriminatory treatment. It is necessary to take into account Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s obligation to mitigate his losses. Mr. Tahmourpour did not make sufficient efforts to minimize his losses from the time he left the Depot until the commencement of the hearing. However, from 2000 to 2002, it was difficult for him to work because of the psychological impact of his experiences at the Depot, and because of the time necessarily spent by him on his complaint. On that basis, the grace period was established at 2 years and 12 weeks. However, Mr. Tahmourpour could have been gainfully employed after that time. (emphasis added)\n[47] As I understand the Tribunal\u2019s decision, there were no other facts that were taken into account in determining the amount of the monetary compensation awarded to Mr. Tahmourpour. I am unable to discern from the Tribunal\u2019s decision why the Tribunal chose, as the end point of the second time period, the date on which Mr. Tahmourpour accepts or rejects an offer of re-enrolment, as opposed to an earlier fixed date. I agree with the judge that the Tribunal did not put its mind to the question of when, after the end of the grace period, the discrimination suffered by Mr. Tahmourpour ceased to have an effect on his income earning capacity. In the absence of an explanation from the Tribunal, that part of the Tribunal\u2019s award providing for the top-up cannot be found to be reasonable. (emphasis added)\n[48] As there is one ground of appeal on which I agree with the judge, a question arises as to whether the remedy ordered by the judge (that the matter be returned to the Tribunal for rehearing) should be permitted to stand. In my view, the question as to what cap or other limitation should be placed on the top-up is a question that must be answered by the Tribunal. Therefore, I would return this matter to the Tribunal only for the purpose of considering the imposition of a cap or limitation on the top-up. (emphasis added)\nJudicial Review by the Federal Court\n[84] Next, the applicant (RCMP) submits that there ought to have been a cap on the lost wages award in the order of two years. The applicant relies on the decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Review Tribunal and the Federal Court of Appeal in Morgan v. Canada (Canadian Armed forces), [1990] C.H.R.D. No. 10 (QL); rev\u2019d [1992] 2 F.C. 401 (C.A.).\n[85] In Morgan, Mr. Morgan was found to have been denied a position of employment with the Canadian Armed Forces by the discriminatory action of the Forces, as opposed to merely losing an opportunity for employment. A majority of the Review Tribunal held that when an order of reinstatement is made, compensation ought to continue until there is compliance with the order. The Federal Court of Appeal disagreed. It found that the Review Tribunal erred in failing to establish a cap or cut-off point for the compensation period independent of the reinstatement order. The Court endorsed the observation of the minority member of the Review Tribunal that the duration of the compensatory period need not coincide with re-instatement whenever it may occur and held that the majority erred in failing to establish that cap. \u2026 (emphasis added)\n[86] The minority member, whose decision the Court of Appeal accepted, held that the Armed Forces ought reasonably to have foreseen the consequences of its discriminatory acts as extending for a period of some three and one-half years.\n[87] In this case, the Tribunal made no assessment of any cut-off period, nor did it engage in any analysis as to whether the period could reasonably extend to the date of the decision, which was some eight and one-half years after the termination of his cadet contract.\n[88] In failing to engage in any analysis the Tribunal erred in law. The damages awarded under the Act cannot run forever and, as the Court of Appeal observed in Morgan, common sense requires that some limits be placed upon liability for the consequences flowing from an act [discrimination].\n[91] I find that the Tribunal: \u2026 (iv) erred in awarding lost wages to the date of reinstatement in a training program having engaged in no analysis as to whether that period could reasonably extend to that date.\nIV. Extracts from the Decision of the Tribunal [7] I have carefully reviewed the decision of the Tribunal, in particular the following extracts:\nShould compensation for lost wages be provided to Mr. Tahmourpour for the loss of the opportunity to complete training that was caused by the RCMP\u2019s discriminatory conduct?\n[218] Yes. The RCMP\u2019s discriminatory conduct denied Mr. Tahmourpour the opportunity to complete training and to make his living as an RCMP officer. He must be compensated for the loss of wages that he would have earned.\nHow is compensation for wage loss resulting from the denial of the opportunity to be calculated?\n[219] The Tribunal\u2019s approach in Chopra of providing compensation for wage loss, discounting for any uncertainty in obtaining the position, was found by the Court of Appeal to be an acceptable way of compensating for lost opportunity (Chopra, at para.43) I shall follow suit. \u2026\nFor what time period should Mr. Tahmourpour be compensated?\n[224] Mr. Tahmourpour claimed that he should be paid wages and benefits lost on a retroactive basis for the entire period from 1999 until instatement as an RCMP officer or, in the alternative, until the date of this decision with a further order for future wage loss in the event that instatement is not ordered.\n[225] Dealing first with the claim for retroactive wage and benefit loss, in Chopra, the Court of Appeal stated that in exercising its discretion under s. 53(2)(c) to award compensation for any or all wages lost as a result of the discriminatory practice, the Tribunal may well find that the principles underlying the doctrine of mitigation of losses in other contexts apply. Society has an interest in promoting economic efficiency by requiring those who have suffered a loss to take steps to minimize that loss as it is not in the public interest to allow some members of society to maximize their loss at the expense of others, even if those others are the authors of the loss. Thus while a tribunal is not bound to apply the doctrine of mitigation, it is not prohibited from doing so in the exercise of its discretion to determine the amounts payable to a complainant.\n[226] I find that it is appropriate in this case to consider whether Mr. Tahmourpour took steps to minimize his losses. Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s evidence on this issue was weak. \u2026 (emphasis added)\n[231] I find that Mr. Tahmourpour has not made sufficient efforts to minimize his losses from the time he left Depot until the commencement of the hearing in August 2007. (emphasis added)\n[232] \u2026 I am not convinced that Mr. Tahmourpour put real effort into pursuing gainful employment that would have minimized his losses. Indeed, he stated that he could not do so because his human rights complaint took all of his time. (emphasis added)\n[233] I do not accept that working on his human rights complaint required Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s full-time effort \u2026 Therefore I find it unreasonable that Mr. Tahmourpour was unable to work at all, other than to sell one property and perform one translation assignment from January 2002 to the present time. (emphasis added)\n[236] The RCMP shall pay Mr. Tahmourpour the full-time wages and benefits that he would have received for two years from January 2000\u2026 In addition, the RCMP must pay Mr. Tahmourpour the wages and salary that he would have received for an additional 480 hours of work.\n[237] Taking into account the period during which Mr. Tahmourpour could not work for health and complaint-related reasons, I find that Mr. Tahmourpour could have been gainfully employed until the present time. I do not accept that working on his human rights complaint precluded full-time employment from the time that he was well enough to work until the commencement of the hearing in August of 2007. People make all sorts of arrangements and accommodations to pursue important activities outside of full-time employment. Mr. Tahmourpour could have done so too. (emphasis added)\n[238] The RCMP should be required to pay only the difference between what Mr. Tahmourpour would have earned at a full-time job and what he would have earned as an RCMP officer from the date upon which the grace period for health and complaint-related time ends until the date of this decision. The RCMP is therefore, ordered to pay the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age and the salary that he would have received as an officer for this time period. (emphasis added) \u2026\nShould there be an order for future wage loss?\n[242] There was no evidence that the discriminatory conduct caused any permanent damage to Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s ability to work. \u2026 (emphasis added)\n[243] Therefore, until Mr. Tahmourpour is provided with an offer to enter the training program, he should be paid the difference between the average full-time industrial wage in Canada for persons of his age and the salary that he would have received as an RCMP officer up to the date of the training offer. (emphasis added)\n[244] Upon the extension of the offer to attend training, the RCMP\u2019s obligation to compensate Mr. Tahmourpour for the loss of the opportunity to complete training in 1999 is extinguished. No further payments shall be made under this head of compensation.\nV. Reconsideration [8] There is some inconsistency in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons regarding the time period for which Mr. Tahmourpour should be compensated. Initially, the Tribunal concludes that the RCMP should be required to pay Mr. Tahmourpour a top-up only from the end of the grace period until the date of her decision (see paragraph 238). The Tribunal then finds that the top-up should be paid until the RCMP extends a training offer to Mr. Tahmourpour (see paragraph 243). Finally, the Tribunal\u2019s remedial order (iv) requires the RCMP to pay a top-up until such time as Mr. Tahmourpour accepts or rejects an offer of re-enrollment in the RCMP training program.\n[9] Bearing in mind the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in Morgan and Chopra, and having examined the judgment of the Tribunal on this issue, in particular the Tribunal\u2019s findings that Mr. Tahmourpour could have been gainfully employed from the time of the expiry of the grace period until the date of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, that there was no evidence that the discriminatory conduct caused any permanent damage to Mr. Tahmourpour\u2019s ability to work, and that Mr. Tahmourpour did not make sufficient efforts to minimize his losses, I am unable to identify any facts, reasons or causal connection that would justify remedial order (iv) and the continuation of compensation for lost wages beyond the grace period of two years and twelve weeks.\nSigned by\nWallace G.

ANALYSIS\nXV. REMEDY\nXVI. ORDER\nI. INTRODUCTION [1] These are my Reasons for Decision concerning the Complaint of James Peter Hughes against Elections Canada (EC). Mr. Hughes alleges that he was denied an accessible polling location and adversely differentiated against on account of his disability when he went to vote at St. Basil's Church in the downtown Toronto riding of Toronto Centre on two occasions within a 7-month time span (the March 17, 2008 federal by-election and the October 14, 2008 federal general election), contrary to subsections 5(a) and 5(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (CHRA). His Complaint also deals with the lack of proper investigation and action by EC following his verbal and written complaints to it.\nII. COMPLAINT [2] Mr. Hughes filed his Complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on June 5, 2008. As this was four months before the October 14th general election, the Complaint form itself only dealt with the March 17th by-election incident. The Commission investigated and referred the subject-matter of the Complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) on December 29, 2008. By this time, the second incident of the October 14th general election had occurred. This second incident and EC's handling of the two incidents form part of the subject-matter before the Tribunal. None of the parties disagree with this.1\nIII. PRELIMINARY MATTERS Commission Not Participating\n[3] The Commission indicated early after the referral that it would be participating in the hearing. A week before the hearing on the merits began, it indicated that it would no longer participate; however, it remains a party. Commission counsel did indicate in writing that the Commission would participate in any systemic remedies, including monitoring of EC, if such remedies were granted by the Tribunal.\nMotion for Interested Party Status\n[4] Prior to the hearing, the Council of Canadians with Disabilities (CCD) brought a motion to be added as an intervenor or Interested Party. The Complainant supported CCD's motion and EC consented with conditions. The Tribunal granted the request. CCD was allowed to make oral and written argument. The title of proceeding was amended accordingly. CCD's participation in the hearing was helpful. CCD is a pan-Canadian not-for-profit, multi-disciplinary organization covering a wide spectrum of disabilities. It has participated in many leading human rights cases, including before the Supreme Court of Canada.\nIV. ISSUES [5] At the commencement of the hearing, EC's counsel stated that his client would be making certain admissions regarding liability. The other parties stated that further facts not admitted by EC also constitute liability and are aggravating in nature, and relevant to the personal and systemic remedies sought by them. I consider in these Reasons the extent of EC's liability and what remedies are appropriate.\nV. DECISION [6] The Complaint has been substantiated.\nVI. LIST OF WITNESSES The following individuals gave evidence:\nMr. James Peter Hughes - the Complainant; Prof. Catherine Frazee - disability rights\/accessibility expert; Mr. Michel Roussel - senior director, field readiness and event management, EC; and Mr. Robert Topping - architect and expert on accessibility, universal design and barrier-free design.\nVII. FACTS [7] The parties filed a limited Agreed Statement of Facts. As indicated earlier, at the beginning of the hearing, EC conceded certain facts, the combination of which EC agreed, results in liability under subsection 5(b) of the CHRA. The concession of liability involved the admission of facts regarding the walk to, and entrance #2 itself. EC has agreed not to use St. Basil's Church again as a polling location. There are many better, fully accessible locations close by. There was some disagreement as to certain facts. Below are my findings of fact, including those facts found in the Agreed Statement of Facts and those admitted by EC.\n[8] Mr. James Peter Hughes and his wife lived for many years in the United States. They moved back to Canada upon retirement. Mr. Hughes has post-polio syndrome and uses a wheelchair or walker. They live in a condo in downtown Toronto, a couple blocks away from St. Basil's Church, the polling location used in the two electoral events at issue here. Mr. Hughes testified that the March 2008 by-election was his first time voting in a Canadian election since he lived in Quebec in the 1970s. This was an important event for him. Unfortunately, the election experience he received was less than what he had hoped for.\nVoting in the March 17th By-election\n[9] On March 17, 2008, he proceeded using his walker to vote at St. Basil's Church. The Church is in a beautiful, old building in downtown Toronto. It has three entrances: entrance #1 (main one, south side); entrance #2 (back one, north side); and entrance #3 (side one, west side). More will be said about the three entrances later in these Reasons.\n[10] From the street, the Complainant walked up a sloped hill on a long, winding path to entrance #1. At the front door was a perfectly acceptable handicap ramp, said the Complainant. He said he found some cryptic, yellow EC signs, but they pointed away from entrance #1 and toward entrance #3. Entrance #1 was locked. Said signs indicate to me as well that EC (at least the official who put up the signs) was aware that entrance #1 was locked and unusable as an accessible entrance, for disabled and non-disabled voters. Mr. Hughes proceeded around the building to entrance #3. When he opened the door, he was somewhat startled to find a flight of stairs leading downward. It was clearly not an accessible entrance.\n[11] Mr. Hughes was not able to get down the stairs without assistance. He called out for assistance and someone came over. The person appeared to be an EC official and told him he could either come down the stairs or walk around the building (to entrance #2). He chose to deal with the known obstacle rather than face the unknown ones. The official took his walker down the stairs and Mr. Hughes then proceeded to go down the stairs on the seat of my pants. The Complainant testified that this was rather humiliating. He was concerned as well about falling. They then put the walker back together and he walked down the hallway to the election polling stations in the basement hall.\n[12] His experience with inaccessibility did not end there. When in the hall, he was not able to vote in the polling booth because the tables were placed too close together, blocking his path. EC officials had to re-arrange the tables. A person using a walker or wheelchair did not have a direct pathway to the private voting booth.\n[13] While in the Church basement hall, Mr. Hughes told a male EC official about his difficult voting experience. He does not remember the name of the official. Mr. Hughes averred that the person replied that the lack of accessibility was for financial reasons and that in federal by-elections they are not given sufficient funds to have an accessible polling station. Mr. Hughes was appalled. EC avers that if this in fact occurred, the official was factually wrong and was not in a position to make such comments. Nothing came of his verbal complaint. I accept Mr. Hughes' testimony on this topic.\n[14] Mr. Hughes eventually got to mark his ballot that day. However, his departure was no less easy. Rather than go back through entrance #3 with its barrier-ridden path, the EC officials offered to help this voter with a disability leave through the back way, entrance #2, adjacent to the parking lot. Mr. Hughes had to walk up a steep, narrow ramp. It was only marginally possible for use with his walker. The two doors leading out to the parking lot weren't open. There was no automatic opening mechanism for the doors. Mr. Topping, who did an onsite inspection on behalf of EC and gave expert opinion evidence at the hearing, agreed that they are heavy, steel doors. Only one of the two double doors was openable. Mr. Hughes' walker had to be folded in order to get it through. Outside the doors, he confronted snow on the ground which hadn't been sufficiently cleared. He stated that the width shoveled looked like it had been done with ambulatory people in mind. It was barely wide enough for his walker's wheels, and certainly not wide enough for a person using a wheelchair. There was a sloped ramp downward. He described it as steep and slippery. I accept Mr. Hughes' testimony that he could not have exited through entrance #2 without assistance.\n[15] Mr. Hughes described the entrance at the back as a freight\/emergency entrance. In his view, it was demeaning and not dignified. He remarked that it doesn't affirm a person as an actual person, but signals they should be handled as freight. I accept that he felt this way. There was a debate among counsel as to whether this constituted a segregated entrance, reminiscent of the images of the Old South in the United States. I make no finding in this regard. Suffice to say, the back entrance was not ideal or acceptable in the circumstances. None of the three entrances to the Church was accessible to Mr. Hughes. Entrance #1 was closed; entrance #2 was fraught with barriers (physically and symbolically); and entrance #3 was inaccessible due to the flight of stairs.\nMr. Hughes' Complaints and EC's Investigation\n[16] In addition to his verbal complaint on the day of the election, Mr. Hughes made a written complaint to EC on March 20, 2008.2 This was done with the assistance of his counsel. It was addressed to the attention of the Elections Officer at Elections Canada in Ottawa. For some unexplained reason, the letter was delivered to the wrong official at EC. That became evident when the Complainant's counsel received a response on March 26th from the General Counsel to the Commissioner of Canada Elections. The General Counsel acknowledged receipt of the letter, but said the subject matter of the complaint fell outside the jurisdiction of the Commissioner, who is responsible for compliance with, and enforcement of, the Canada Elections Act, S.C., 2000, c. 9, as amended (CEA). The General Counsel forwarded the letter to the Legal Services Directorate at EC. Mr. Hughes testified that he felt the letter he received was dismissive of his complaint. EC has no explanation as to why it was sent to the wrong office at its national headquarters in Ottawa. The letter was properly addressed.\n[17] Mr. Hughes stated that he heard nothing from EC regarding his verbal and written complaints to it (other than the letter from the Commissioner's General Counsel referred to in the preceding paragraph) until receiving EC's August 6, 2008 letter to the Commission. On June 5, 2008, he had filed a CHRA Complaint with the Commission. The August 6th letter was EC's response to the CHRA Complaint. Mr. Roussel said that he had his officials investigate Mr. Hughes' Complaint, although he didn't speak to them directly about it and didn't personally speak to the Toronto Centre Returning Officer (RO) or other relevant EC officials at the St. Basil's Church polling stations.\nVoting in the October 14th General Election\n[18] On October 14, 2008, Canadians went to the polls in a federal general election. Mr. Hughes received a Voter Information Card, indicating that his polling station would be at St. Basil's Church once again. The Card even had the universal accessibility symbol on it. Mr. Hughes was hopeful that things would be different this time, that EC had addressed his concerns.\n[19] To his chagrin, the Complainant said he experienced the same lack of accessible voting on October 14th, except for the snow on the ground. When he went to St. Basil's, the front door (entrance #1) with its accessible ramp was again unavailable. This time he proceeded to entrance #2, where he found one of the doors was being held ajar by a broken rock. The Complainant testified that he could not open the heavy steel door himself. With assistance, he entered via entrance #2, voted and left the same way. Mr. Hughes averred that he was quite upset that, notwithstanding his verbal and written complaints to EC some seven months earlier and his June 2008 Complaint to the Commission, EC had not remedied the problem by providing a barrier-free polling facility to exercise his important democratic right to vote. He thought, at best, EC was incompetent; at worst, wilful or bad intentioned.\nPost-October 14th General Election\n[20] Following the election, the Commission referred the subject-matter of the Complaint to the Tribunal on December 29, 2008. EC commissioned architect and accessibility expert Robert Topping to do an on-site inspection of St. Basil's Church and report on certain accessibility issues in March 2009. Mr. Topping's report was tendered as an exhibit and he gave opinion evidence as well at the hearing in October 2009. He outlined some of the problems with the St. Basil's facility from a barrier-free perspective. As a result of Mr. Hughes' Complaint, Mr. Topping's report, the steepness of the incline and better alternative locations in the area, prior to the hearing Mr. Roussel, in his affidavit, indicated that EC would no longer use St. Basil's Church as a polling location, notwithstanding some of its significant advantages (e.g., parking, community use and prior election use). Mr. Roussel did not know if an alternative site had been chosen, as of the hearing.\nVIII. EC: ITS STRUCTURE, ROLE AND ACCESSIBILITY WORK [21] Michel Roussel's witness statement and his viva voce evidence thoroughly described EC's structure, role and work done regarding accessibility matters. At the apex of EC is the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada (CEO), who is an officer of Parliament. There are senior managers below the CEO, including Mr. Roussel. EC's national office in Ottawa is responsible, among other things, for general policies and training of election officials and the overseeing of federal electoral events (general elections, by-elections and referendums). There is also an independent Commissioner of Canada Elections to ensure compliance with, and recommend if necessary, prosecutions of violations of, the CEA.\n[22] Canada has 308 electoral districts, also known as ridings or constituencies, which vary in physical size and population. The largest riding is Nunavut (20% of the land mass of Canada). By contrast, the City of Toronto contains 22 electoral districts. Each district has a RO, appointed by the CEO. The RO is responsible for the preparation and conduct of an electoral event in his\/her electoral district and oversees its execution. Below the RO is an assistant returning officer. Both of these officials are permanent officers and continue their work between elections. Below them are numerous part-time and full-time temporary officials - the deputy returning officer, central poll supervisors, poll clerks, etc.\n[23] Each district has polling locations or sites and within them, polling stations. Toronto Centre electoral district had 75 polling locations (St. Basil's being one of them) with 271 stations. Country-wide, in the 2008 general election, there were over 20,000 polling locations, 63,000 polling stations, and over 200,000 temporary officials. This presents a formidable organizational and logistical challenge to EC, as much work can only be done, according to its governing statute, once the writ is dropped and an election is called. This includes the hiring of most of these 200,000 employees and the signing of leases for polling locations. I acknowledge that much work is done also before and after elections. I have been mindful of the logistical, time-constraining considerations faced by EC. The ROs and others are extremely busy during the 36-day election period.\nAccessibility Requirements\n[24] Parliament has provided for the accessibility of elections in numerous sections of the CEA, including subsection 121(1) which states that a polling station shall be in premises with level access. The term level access is not defined in the statute. In EC's CPS manual it is defined as flat access... Guidelines, not legislatively mandated, indicate that the benchmark for a ramp slope is 1:12 (1 rise per every 12 long). I appreciate that level access is a sub-category of barrier-free access. While the lack of level access is a major barrier, it is by no means the only barrier faced by those with mobility impairments.\n[25] As well, the CEA does not prohibit EC from providing further and greater accommodations than simply level access, and it has done so. This may be seen in its policies, guidelines, manuals, training materials and as outlined on its website, which involves barrier-free accommodations for mobility impairments beyond level access and for non-mobility impairments. EC's Policy on Barrier-Free Access to Voting reads: Offices and polling sites established and maintained by returning officers during an electoral event must in all respects provide barrier-free access. (EC's bolding) In its module on accessibility in its training session for ROs, in one of the Power Point slides, EC says one of the goals of the session is for ROs to be able to [E]nsure barrier free access to the electoral process. EC's Accessibility Information sheet for St. Basil's Church lists many criteria, including accessibility issues other than level access, such as signage and adequate heating. Mr. Roussel also testified that EC considers many factors other than the level or flat access of premises when determining the suitability of polling stations under subsection 121(1) of the CEA, including factors that I would characterize as barrier-free in nature.\n[26] Parliament has also legislated an exception in the CEA to providing level access: subsection 121(2). It sets out the procedure whereby a RO may obtain dispensation from the requirement upon prior approval of the CEO, if the RO is unable to secure suitable level access premises. Mr. Roussel testified that seeking this exemption is a last resort and rare. Any such exemptions are reported by the CEO in his post-election report to Parliament. Instead, EC has paid for the installation of temporary, and formerly also permanent, ramps to overcome barrier issues. In the 2008 general election, 122 ramps were installed across Canada, at a total cost of $127,000.\nSelection of Polling Locations\n[27] It is the RO's responsibility to select the many polling locations within the district. As Mr. Roussel testified, the ROs conduct onsite evaluations to the best of their ability. There is an inventory or computer data base of over 27,000 locations across Canada. The last onsite inspection of St. Basil's Church appears to have been done on May 20, 2002. The document indicates that the Church met the section 121 level access requirements of the CEA. Mr. Roussel also averred that ROs are not architects or construction estimators and are not equipped with the proper tools to ascertain exact measurements about certain criteria such as the slope of a ramp. Expert witness and architect Robert Topping testified that a layperson would need certain specialized equipment and training to make such accessibility determinations.\n[28] Mr. Roussel also gave evidence that ROs rely on existing information in the database for their pre-election writ plan of which polling locations to use. He said that due to the time constraints once the election has been called, ROs do not have the time to conduct an onsite visit of each location. No doubt that is why ROs are trained to [S]elect suitable polling sites well in advance [of the election being called]. In the RO Manual at p. 12, a chart divides the RO's tasks into Before, During and After Electoral Events. In the Before column for the task dealing with polling stations, it says, inter alia: Visit potential polling sites and Evaluate the accessibility of potential locations.\n[29] In most cases, they confirm the availability with landlords by phone once the writ is issued. Perhaps ROs should confirm with the landlords at that time the accessibility features of the polling locations and their operation during the electoral event (e.g., that accessible entrances will be open).\nAccessibility: What Has EC Done in General?\n[30] As expert witness Robert Topping testified, there have been many advancements in technology and attitudes regarding barrier-free design and accessibility since the 1980s. EC has gone a long way in ensuring barrier-free access in federal elections. This was recognized specifically by the Tribunal in Canadian Paraplegic Association v. Elections Canada et al., [1992] C.H.R.D. No. 2 (CPA): i.e, The strong positive actions taken by Elections Canada after 1984... at p. 27 and In view of the steps which Elections Canada has taken since 1984 to improve accessibility of polling stations,... at p. 28. That case involved nine complaints of persons with disabilities who either could not vote because of barrier-ridden polling locations or voted with difficulty in the 1984 federal election in Manitoba. These complaints spurred EC to act, ahead of the Tribunal's decision in 1992. EC created in 1988, with the help of Barrier-free Design Consultants, the RO Guide Accessible Facilities: How to Make Voting More Accessible.\n[31] EC also developed a national inventory or database of over 27,000 accessible locations with an onsite evaluation done for each. It created an Accessibility Checklist for each polling site to be entered into the National Inventory of Electoral Facilities. In the RO Manual: A Guide to Conducting Federal Electoral Events, it says at p. 81, ROs should identify problem areas so that corrective measures can be taken IN ADVANCE. (EC's capitalizing) As well, EC began to share polling place information with internal and external groups so that the information could be complete and accurate.\n[32] There is also a Manual for Central Poll Supervisors. In the pre-polling day tasks section at p. 12, it says the CPS should, Examine the layout...identify issues. I suggest that EC specifically mention accessibility issues in this part to highlight the importance of said issues. EC also includes this language in the Manual for Deputy Returning Officers and Poll Clerks. EC even has a Training Officers Manual, including a section on tips or lessons for Assisting an Elector with a Disability.\n[33] I would be remiss if I didn't mention the very good website of EC. It contains a lot of useful information, including many reports and documents. There is a fair bit of information concerning accessibility features, including a section entitled Accessibility of the Electoral System. I would recommend that, for ease of reference, EC add a link on the main page of its website under Information for You entitled Voters with Disabilities, along with the present ones for Voters, Young Voters and Aboriginal Voters.\n[34] As indicated earlier, EC also does modifications to polling locations, permanent and temporary, to provide level access (e.g., ramps). Mr. Roussel testified that EC never refuses such requests from the ROs.\n[35] EC also provides training for its officials, from the ROs down to the army of 200,000 election day temporary employees. They also train the trainers. Part of the training involves accessibility issues.\n[36] EC makes available to persons with disabilities different ways to vote. In addition to being required to provide level access at polling stations, advance poll sites, RO offices, and revision offices, it provides alternative ways to vote. For example, a transfer certificate may be issued to vote at a nearby accessible polling station where the local one is not accessible. As well, provision is made to have EC officials attend at the home of a disabled voter for him\/her to vote. Special ballots, including mail-in ballots, may also be used.\nWhat Has EC Done Since Mr. Hughes Filed His CHRA Complaint?\n[37] Mr. Roussel says EC has learned a lot from the negative voting experience of Mr. Hughes in the 2008 by-election and general election, and it has improved. For example, EC changed its yellow sign to make the letters bigger and added the universal symbol of accessibility. Counsel for the Complainant avers that this should have been done sooner, as it was mentioned in the CPA decision in 1992.\n[38] EC's counsel also points out that his client admitted liability at the opening of the hearing. However, the Complainant's counsel counters that, given the facts of this case, said admissions came too late. Notwithstanding the timing, the admissions did save time at the hearing and facilitated the co-operative mood of the parties at the hearing.\n[39] Through Mr. Roussel's testimony and its counsel's submissions, EC has agreed to several remedial requests of the Complainant, in whole or in part. These will be spelled out in the section on Remedy in these Reasons for Decision.\nIX. IMPORTANCE OF ELECTIONS [40] The right to vote is protected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: section 3. It is a right, and I would argue, a responsibility or duty of citizens of this country. It is the legal duty of the State to ensure that all barriers, whenever possible, are removed so that citizens may vote. Nowhere is this more significant than for people with disabilities. Professor Frazee was eloquent in articulating the barriers that people with disabilities face in our society, structurally and attitudinally, including the intricacies of disability disadvantage. She set out the context as it would affect a person with a disability attempting to vote. Included in this was the impact of disabled voters going to separate but equal facilities to exercise their franchise or facilities with only back entrances available to them. There should be no hierarchy of citizenship when it comes to voting in Canada: no second class voters. Professor Frazee's expert evidence and Mr. Hughes' testimony showed the damaging impact on persons with disabilities going away from the polling site thinking that their presence was at best unexpected, and at worst unwelcome.\n[41] I also note the evidence of the 2006 Statistics Canada report showing the number of persons with various impairments and disabilities in Canada: 4.4 million Canadians with an activity limitation yielding a disability rate of 14.3%. What is more telling is the demographic trend upward of Canadians reaching the status of senior citizen and the resulting increase of persons with disabilities in Canada, including those with mobility impairments.\nX. STATUTORY PROVISIONS [42] Mr. Hughes' Complaint alleges the violation of subsections 5(a) and 5(b) of the CHRA:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\na) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\nb) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\nXI. UNIQUE STATUS OF HUMAN RIGHTS STATUTES [43] As recently as 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Canada (House of Commons) v. Vaid,3 at para. 81: ...the Canadian Human Rights Act is a quasi-constitutional document and we should affirm that any exemption from its provisions must be clearly stated.\n[44] In Council of Canadians with Disabilities v. Via Rail,4 the Supreme Court of Canada wrote at para. 115:\nIn Winnipeg School Division,5 McIntyre J. confirmed that where there is a conflict between human rights law and other specific legislation, unless an exception is created, the human rights legislation, as a collective statement of public policy, must govern. It follows as a natural corollary that where a statutory provision is open to more than one interpretation, it must be interpreted consistently with human rights principles. The [Canadian Transportation] Agency is therefore obliged to apply the principles of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, when defining and identifying undue obstacles in the transportation context.\nXII. LEGAL PRINCIPLES RELATING TO LIABILITY [45] The initial onus of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination under the CHRA rests with a complainant or the Commission. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and, if believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer or justification from the respondent: Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Limited, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at para. 28. Once that is established, the burden then shifts to the respondent to establish a justification or explanation for the discriminatory practice or action. The respondent's explanation should not figure in the determination of whether the complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination: Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at para. 22.\n[46] Courts and tribunals have held that discrimination may, but need not, be intentional.6 One must look also at the adverse impact or effect of facially neutral practices and policies on an individual or group of individuals, related to prohibited grounds of discrimination.\n[47] The case law recognizes the difficulty of proving allegations of discrimination by direct evidence. Discrimination is frequently practised in a very subtle and subterranean manner. Overt discrimination is rare: Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (No. 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 5038. Rather, it is the Tribunal's task to consider all of the circumstances to determine if there is what is described in the Basi case as the subtle scent of discrimination.\n[48] The standard of proof in discrimination cases is the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities. According to this standard, discrimination may be inferred where the evidence offered in support of the discrimination renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses: Premakumar v. Air Canada (No. 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (C.H.R.T.), at para. 81.\nXIII. LEGAL PRINCIPLES RELATING TO REMEDY [49] The general remedial part of the CHRA is found in section 53. Subsections 53(1)-(4) outline the discretionary awards and orders that the Tribunal may make against a respondent following its substantiation of the complaint before it. Included are orders to cease a discriminatory practice; compensatory awards up to $20,000 for any pain and suffering experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice; a $20,000 maximum of special compensation for loss arising from the wilful or reckless discriminatory action of the respondent; expenses incurred as a result of the loss from the discriminatory action, except for legal costs or expenses in the Tribunal proceeding.7 The Tribunal also may order the taking of measures to redress the discriminatory practice, or to prevent the same or similar practice from occurring in the future.\n[50] The Supreme Court of Canada has allowed human rights tribunals a certain degree of latitude in the making of remedial orders.8 This is in keeping with the purposes and goals of anti-discrimination statutes. Of course, orders of a remedial nature must be linked or have a nexus9 to the lis or subject-matter of the complaint substantiated by the tribunal: the four corners of the complaint or the real subject matter.10 The remedy must be commensurate with the breach. The orders also must be reasonable11 and the remedial discretion exercised in light of the evidence presented.12\n[51] Remedial orders also may include the involvement of the human rights commission or other parties in terms of consultation, or the appointment of a monitor for the implementation of the orders.13 Such involvement of other actors recognizes that the courts and tribunals have an adjudicative role and formal process that do not translate well into the technical or task-specific aspects of the implementation of orders often affecting the day-to-day operations of a governmental or corporate respondent.\nXIV. ANALYSIS Subsections 5(a) and 5(b) of the CHRA\n[52] The Complainant and CCD argue that both subsections of section 5 have been violated here. EC says the case is one of subsection 5(b) and that the Tribunal need not address subsection 5(a). I find that both subsections have been infringed in the instant case.\n[53] First, I am satisfied that EC provides a service and facility customarily available to the general public under the section. It is not just the provision of physical space in which to vote. EC provides a public service - a paramount one - of providing the means by which the public may exercise its democratic franchise. The service includes providing public information, barrier-free voting locations and polling stations, polite interaction of its officials with the voters, and the facilitation of accessible voting for all, including voters with disabilities.\n[54] The foregoing applies the reasoning of the Federal Court of Appeal in Watkin v. Canada (Attorney General),14 which is the recent case on services under section 5 of the CHRA. That case involved a complaint against Health Canada alleging discrimination in the regulation of herbal products based on ethnic origin. The Court held that the enforcement actions of Health Canada did not constitute a service as per section 5. The Court stated that not all governmental actions are services under the CHRA. At para. 28, the Court wrote: Public authorities can and do engage in the provision of services in fulfilling their statutory functions. It then listed several examples of services provided by government departments and agencies. The running of elections by EC could fit easily into that list. At para. 31, the Court further stated: I agree that because government actions are generally taken for the benefit of the public, the customarily available to the general public requirement in section 5 will usually be present in cases involving discrimination arising from government actions...\n[55] Various findings of liability fall, in the case before me, under either or both of the subsections here. The fact that Mr. Hughes was able to vote does not insulate EC from subsection 5(a): to deny, or to deny access to,...; e.g., his having to go down the stairs by the seat of [his] pants, and be assisted into and out of the premises.\nLiability of EC\n[56] As indicated earlier, EC admitted at the outset of the hearing its liability under subsection 5(b) of the CHRA only. The Complainant and CCD argue that EC is liable under subsection 5(a) too. EC says its liability is based on the combined effect of various facts:\nthe long, sloped walk to entrance #2; the insufficient signage leading to entrance #2; the incline leading to entrance #2 had a slope of 1:8.8 (or 11.4%), which is significantly steeper than the slope of 1:12 (or 8.25%) set out in EC's Accessible Facilities Guide; the doors to entrance #2 were heavy to open; only one of the doors to entrance #2 could be opened from the outside; with only one door open, entrance #2 was too narrow for a wheelchair to go through; this was a polling location in downtown Toronto. Better alternative locations exist. During his argument, counsel to EC stipulated a few more facts concerning liability: the door to entrance #2 was stuck on the day of the by-election; there was non-clearance of snow on the incline; the ramp on the inside of the Church was inadequate; there was a step and no handrails on both elections; there was inadequate spacing between tables in the polling stations in both elections; and EC accepts Mr. Hughes' description of the humiliation he felt and his evidence generally, but not his characterization of segregation. Counsel for the Complainant and CCD point out that none of the above admissions in #1-12 were made in the Agreed Statement of Facts or prior to the commencement of the hearing.\n[57] I agree with Mr. Hughes' comment that the August 6th letter was dismissive of his Complaint. Essentially it says:\nSt. Basil's Church provided level access as required by subsection 121(1) of the CEA. As we now know, that was not the case, as entrance #1 was locked. EC thoroughly reviewed Mr. Hughes' Complaint, including interviewing election officers and conducting an on-site inspection of the polling station. The August 6th letter contains many incorrect facts, resulting in incorrect conclusions. It [St. Basil's Church] has three access doors which were unlocked during voting hours, two of which provide level entry. Again, only entrance #1 provides a barrier-free pathway, and it was locked. Mr. Hughes did not see the posted signs. EC did not call the RO or any EC official who was present at St. Basil's that day to give evidence, nor did it enter into evidence the investigative report. I have Mr. Hughes' evidence regarding the signs and I accept it. Every effort was made to keep the ramps cleared of snow on the advance poll and by-election polling days. I accept Mr. Hughes' testimony to the contrary, that the efforts weren't sufficient. [O]ther disabled electors made use of these level access [entrances] without difficulty... St. Basil's Church had been used in the 2004 and 2006 general elections and EC has no record of any other accessibility complaint being made about the polling location. Of course, one wouldn't know necessarily if a previous accessibility complaint had been made, given that Mr. Roussel testified that EC doesn't have a system for logging such complaints. None of the officials interviewed could remember anything about the comment made by the official to Mr. Hughes regarding not having the money for accessibility accommodations in by-elections. Indeed, no mention is made of his verbal complaint that day. As indicated earlier, I accept Mr. Hughes' version of this episode.\n[58] Mr. Hughes indicated that he was quite upset with EC's August 6th letter. He stated that EC's response, or lack thereof in general, upset him as much as the frustrating voting experiences. He said the August 6th letter was dismissive and suggested that he was incompetent and unable to read signs: The letter was a complete denial of my experience. I agree that the tone of the letter is somewhat dismissive. But more importantly, many of the factual statements given are clearly incorrect: in particular, that entrance #1 (the only accessible one of the three entrances) had been open on the day of the by-election. I find it difficult to accept that, after having interviewed its officials who were present at St. Basil's Church and investigated the matter, EC was under the illusion that entrance #1 had been available on the day of the by-election. That suggests that, notwithstanding the signs pointing away from entrance #1, no one told the EC investigating official that entrance #1 had been locked that day. I do not know from the evidence whether EC in its investigation contacted the Church to verify what entrances were open that day. At a minimum, EC's investigation was flawed.\n[59] I find the following additional aspects of EC's liability in this matter:\nEC denied the Complainant barrier-free access to voting in both the 2008 by-election and general election in that not one entrance was accessible to a person with the disability that Mr. Hughes has; EC denied him a service and adversely differentiated against him in its sub-standard investigation of his verbal and written complaints to it. EC didn't even record his March 17th election day verbal complaint. EC's response to his written complaint to it and his CHRA Complaint was tardy and inaccurate, and its tone dismissive. It is disappointing that in its August 6th letter to the Commission addressing the CHRA Complaint (five months after his complaints to EC), EC made so many factual errors. The most glaring one was that all three entrances were unlocked during voting hours. Notwithstanding EC said in the August 6th letter that in the course of its review of his complaint election officers were interviewed and an on-site inspection of the polling station was conducted, no one at EC's national headquarters in Ottawa realized that the only accessible entrance (main, front door #1) had been locked on election day until November 2008 when the investigation was completed, according to Mr. Roussel's testimony. But the August 6th letter states that EC's investigation had been completed by then. Had EC done a competent investigation sooner, it no doubt would have realized this fact and rectified it for the October 2008 general election by either contacting St. Basil's Church and making sure it kept the door unlocked on election day or seeking out a different (and accessible) location. I accept Mr. Hughes' evidence that EC's poor handling of his verbal and written complaints to EC and his Complaint to the Commission, including the tone and content of the August 6th letter, upset him as much or more than the actual two voting events.\n[60] Based on the evidence presented, I am satisfied that a prima facie case has been made out by the Complainant and no reasonable explanation, defence or exemption provided by the Respondent with regard to the additional facts triggering liability not admitted to by EC. The Respondent indicated that mistakes were made and they have learned from the incidents.\nXV. REMEDY [61] Having found liability, I turn to the question of remedy, which dominated much of the hearing.\nCompensation and Interest\n[62] The Complainant has asked for $10,000 under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA to compensate him for the pain and suffering he experienced, plus interest. Counsel directed me to my decision as Chair of the Ontario Human Rights Board of Inquiry in a case dealing with denial of equal treatment and services to persons with disabilities attempting to go to the movies. In that case, Turnbull, supra, I awarded damages for loss arising out of the infringement to the complainants, varying from $8,000-10,000. Counsel says voting is as important as or more so than going to the movies. Also, Mr. Hughes had to endure the indignity on two occasions. Counsel for EC suggests a more appropriate range is $2,500-5,000. I award Mr. Hughes $10,000 under paragraph 53(2)(e). I consider the following to be relevant:\nvoting is one of the most sacred rights of citizenship and that includes the right to do so in an accessible context; the violation of Mr. Hughes' rights occurred in two separate elections within a 7-month period; and EC also infringed his right to a competent and prompt investigation and handling of his verbal and written complaints.\n[63] I also award interest on the above amount, pursuant to rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and subsection 53(4) of the CHRA.\nSystemic Remedies\n[64] Counsel for the Complainant and CCD urge me to make extensive systemic remedies. They say that there were many errors and by more than one individual, they were system wide and not a simple, isolated error.\n[65] EC does not agree that there is a systemic problem here and consequently, no such type of orders should be made. Given EC's apology to Mr. Hughes at the hearing via Mr. Roussel's testimony and its promise not to use St. Basil's Church again, there is no need for such orders, says EC.\n[66] EC's counsel also points to a series of emails among counsel where Commission counsel indicated that he did not think this file gives rise to systemic remedies. He also wrote notwithstanding, that the Commission would be willing to monitor any systemic remedy ordered by the Tribunal: The Commission will always participate in systemic remedies, especially if the Tribunal asks for our involvement. I appreciate the Commission's willingness to monitor any systemic remedy that I may grant.\n[67] I wish to add that EC, through Mr. Roussel's testimony and its counsel's closing argument, has consented, in whole or in part, to many of the systemic future practices orders requested by the Complainant and CCD.15 I acknowledge the candour and co-operative approach that EC showed with regard to the question of remedy.\n[68] The findings I have made clearly indicate a systemic problem. The following exchange took place in final argument between EC's counsel and me:\nCOUNSEL: But this wasn't a case of what went wrong focused on the system. It's one where what went wrong focused on people not quite doing the right things under the system.\nTRIBUNAL: But that is part of the system too. The system is made up of people.\nCOUNSEL: That's true...We saw this basically as a case of human error.\nIn EC's case, the system is a large pyramid from the top (the CEO and management in Ottawa) down to the 200,000 election day officials. There is no divisibility to EC: the governmental entity is responsible for the actions of all of its officers and employees, full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary, acting in the course of their employment.16 EC's statement that it will no longer use St. Basil's Church as a polling location does not sufficiently redress the discriminatory practice before me or prevent its recurrence, as per paragraph 53(2)(a) of the CHRA.\n[69] I am mindful of the importance of courts and tribunals being sensitive to their role as judicial and quasi-judicial arbiters respectively. In particular, they should not fashion remedies which usurp the role of the other branches of governance: Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, at 6. The Supreme Court of Canada also points out: The boundaries of the courts' proper role will vary according to the right at issue and the context of each case.17 My Order attempts to prevent similar future discriminatory practices from occurring while respecting the mandate given by the Parliament of Canada to the Respondent.\n[70] I indicated that in fashioning these systemic remedies, I would try to strike a fair balance - neither over-kill nor under-kill. It is an art, and not a science. EC's counsel asked me not to use the remedial salvo in the first round. The Complainant and CCD said it's more akin to the third round - the CPA case in 1992 with its many striking similarities to the Hughes' Complaint, and the two occurrences in Mr. Hughes' case. I agree. However, much progress has been achieved by EC in providing accessible voting before (e.g., the 1988 general election) and since the 1992 CPA Decision. Nevertheless, it is disappointing that in the disability rights\/accessibility-heightened time in which we find ourselves living as we enter the second decade of the 21st century, Mr. Hughes would have had to experience the humiliation and indignities of those two voting events, within a 7-month time span, followed by the tardy investigation, inaccurate conclusions and poor handling of his verbal and written complaints. Of particular relevance is that, in the wake of Mr. Hughes' verbal and written complaints to EC about the by-election incident, EC failed to improve the accessibility of the polling location in the general election seven months later. So notwithstanding EC does a lot of good things re: accessibility, the deficiencies here suggest the need for improvement via a future practices Order.\n[71] To ensure the right balance is struck when determining the scope of this Order, one must ask: what did the discriminatory practice consist of; how serious was it; what was its source; and how does one redress it? As I indicated in the foregoing, the problem is not so much the standards or policies on accessibility, or EC's training in regard to them. They can be improved no doubt, updated, etc. To its credit, EC has indicated a willingness to engage in this process and with the involvement of the other parties. The problem is more in the nature of the policies and guidelines and training not being followed or applied by EC officials. There was also a stark problem in EC's internal mechanisms for handling complaints about access barriers to voting by persons with disabilities.\n[72] I also find there was a lack of communication of information between the ground troops - officials at the St. Basil's polling location - and the Toronto Centre RO; between the RO and EC headquarters in Ottawa; and between various parts of headquarters (Commissioner's office, EC's legal services branch, etc.). The most glaring example is EC's inaccurate conclusion, after they thoroughly reviewed the matter, that all entrances were open and two of the three were accessible. Moreover, EC's legal services section only concluded that entrance #1 had been closed in November 2008, eight months after Mr. Hughes raised the issue and a month after a repeat of the inaccessible election at St. Basil's in the general election. Earlier, I made the finding and inferred that, given the EC yellow sign pointing away from entrance #1, some EC official obviously knew that entrance #1 was locked. But that information did not trickle up to the RO or Ottawa headquarters. Unfortunately, unlike the CPA hearing in 1990, neither the RO nor any other official at the polling location in question testified before me.\n[73] The Complainant, supported by CCD, submitted a 5-page list of remedies sought. EC's counsel responded verbally and in writing to them. Mr. Roussel also testified about the various remedial measures that EC would be willing to accept or consider, including co-operation and consultation with the other parties. I am impressed by the number of remedies that were agreed to in whole or in part by EC. Some of course were not agreed to and strongly opposed by EC. There is overlap among some of the remedies sought by the Complainant and CCD and agreed to by EC.\n[74] What follows is my award of the systemic or future practices remedies after careful consideration of the submissions of all the parties. The implementation of this Order will depend on the collaboration and co-operation of all the parties, and in particular, EC given it's the Respondent organization that the Order is directed at. Given the positive attitude of EC at the hearing and the non-adversarial, co-operative interaction among the parties at the hearing, I am confident that the Order will be effective. Of course, I will be available to speak with the parties and issue any Directions or further Orders as required, dealing with implementation of the Order herein.\nMonitoring, Consultation, etc.\n[75] The Complainant and CCD asked that I appoint a monitor to deal with the implementation of my Order, similar to my role as monitor in the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario cases of Lepofsky, supra (footnote 13). They also cite the decision in McKinnon, supra (footnote 13) where the Ontario Human Rights Board of Inquiry ordered the creation of a Compliance Committee and appointment of a third party to develop and monitor training programs. They have also asked for the Commission and CCD to be involved in various aspects of the Order, as well as the Complainant himself. EC argues that a monitor is not necessary and that the Commission could take on a monitor-like role, and EC and the Commission would report back to the Tribunal.\n[76] I have given careful consideration to the parties' submissions on this subject. I am also in the unique position of having been the monitor in the Lepofsky cases since 2005. I have come to the conclusion that an external monitor is not necessary in the case before me. This case is not Lepofsky or McKinnon. In particular, I note the positive steps taken by EC during the hearing, including its admission of liability; its consent to many of the remedies proposed, in whole or in part; EC's agreement to the post-hearing involvement of the Commission and consultation with CCD or other disability groups and the Complainant; and the co-operation among all the parties during the hearing. If future events show me that I was incorrect, I reserve the right to appoint a third party monitor.\n[77] Instead of appointing a third party as the monitor, I accept the offer of the Commission that it will monitor the implementation of my Order. This exercise should be a collaborative one. EC will consult with the other parties (i.e., the Commission, the Complainant and CCD) about various aspects of my Order, including the implementation of them. EC will pay the reasonable expenses of CCD and the Complainant to participate in the implementation phase, but not legal fees in this proceeding: see Mowat, supra, footnote 7.\n[78] If there is disagreement between EC and any of the parties during the implementation phase, that party may bring a motion before me. Of course, collaboration and co-operation are essential for the implementation process to work. I expect that a party would request the assistance of a Commission or Tribunal mediator before bringing a motion.\nGreater Consultation with Voters with Disabilities\n[79] I believe that greater consultation by EC with voters with disabilities and disability groups, such as CCD, will prevent similar discriminatory practices from occurring in the future. Such individuals and groups could greatly assist EC in almost all of the remedial areas that my Order touches upon: e.g., choice of polling locations and stations, standards of accessibility, signage, training manuals and programs. The foregoing is distinct from, and does not conflict with, the finding of the Federal Court that the duty to accommodate does not include a legal duty to consult.18\n[80] Mr. Roussel testified about the various groups that are consulted by EC about location of polling stations, such as Members of Parliament, aboriginal elders, student leaders, etc. Why not also consult persons with disabilities and disability groups? Mr. Roussel was quite open to various suggestions about greater involvement of, and consultation with, persons with disabilities and their group organizations by EC. He also testified about the numerous surveys, studies and post-mortems initiated by EC following each general election. For example, EC conducts a Survey to Aboriginal Elders and Youth. Why not also embark upon a Survey to Persons With Disabilities and Disability Groups? EC shall consider the above and discuss same with the other parties, and in particular, with CCD, and formulate a consultation plan within six months.\nCease Order\n[81] EC shall cease from situating polling stations in locations that do not provide barrier-free access in any electoral district in Canada, within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA. This is subject to the standard of bona fide justification and the duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship under paragraph 15(1)(g) and subsection 15(2) of the CHRA respectively, once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\n[82] Nothing in my Reasons and Order is meant to govern the exercise of the CEO's discretion under subsection 121(2) of the CEA to exempt a polling station from the level access premises requirement. No subsection 121(2) exemption was given for St. Basil's Church by the CEO in the present Complaint. As indicated earlier in these Reasons, EC already provides for greater accommodation in the accessibility area than mere level access (i.e., flat access, no stairs to climb). My concern is not what the CEA requires in terms of disability accommodation and accessibility, but rather, what the CHRA calls for. EC acknowledges the applicability of the CHRA to it. However, in his opening statement, EC's counsel talked about the separation of powers. While not challenging the Tribunal's jurisdiction in this matter, he remarked that, Some things are better left to Parliament and its agencies.\nNational Inventory of Electoral Facilities Database\n[83] The Complainant and CCD urge me to order EC to review, update and report on this inventory of over 27,000 polling locations across Canada. EC submitted that such a country-wide audit of each and every location would be extremely difficult from a logistical point of view. EC counsel correctly points out that the Complainant has not proven the existence of an error in the computerized inventory, other than in regard to St. Basil's. And he says the error was not due to the information about St. Basil's in the inventory or its physical structure. Rather, the error was due to the fact that entrance #1 was locked during the two electoral events.\n[84] I agree that checking all 27,000 locations is a huge undertaking. However, Mr. Roussel testified that EC used to visit every site (current and prospective) before the recent elections of minority governments. The last national audit was done in 2002. And the Guidelines and Manuals require ROs to consider locations before an election is called and to secure them after the election is called. The national inventory is a tool or means of achieving the goal of barrier-free voting facilities for Canadians. I am not going to order EC to conduct such an audit or publicly report on it. The discriminatory practice in which EC was found to have engaged was not a result of the data entered for St. Basil's in the inventory of electoral facilities. However, I note that EC consents to, within six months, Implement a procedure for verification of the accessibility of facilities on the day of the electoral event. EC shall do so and consult with the other parties about same.\nStandards of Accessibility\n[85] Regarding the issue of standards of accessibility, this was not the source for EC's liability in this case. There was not enough of a nexus with the discriminatory practice. Of course, standards change and evolve, in terms of philosophy, attitudes and technology. Accordingly, I recommend, but do not order, EC to review the standards of accessibility employed by EC and consult with the other parties regarding same. These standards are included at, but not limited to, page 2, para. 4 of the revised list of remedies sought by the Complainant.\nPolicies and Guidelines\n[86] EC's policies and guidelines about accessibility can be improved and updated, but they were not a major source for my findings of liability. However, EC consents to, within twelve months, Review the Accessible Facilities Guide, Accessibility Checklist, and accessibility sections of the Manuals for the Returning Officers and the above categories of election workers [CPSs, DROs, Poll Clerks, Information Officers and Registration Officers]. I order EC to do so, and to consult with the other parties about same.\nStandard Lease for Polling Locations\n[87] The Complainant and CCD ask that I order EC to revise its standard lease for polling locations to include the requirement that the leased premises provide level access and are barrier free. If the lease with St. Basil's had included such a term and condition, it may have triggered a discussion about entrance #1 and prevented it from being locked on the day of the by-election and general election. Such a provision raises the consciousness of accessibility issues to the lessor and lessee and could reasonably prevent similar practices from occurring in the future. I order EC to do so within six months, and consult with the other parties about same.\nSignage at Polling Locations and Stations\n[88] I accept Mr. Hughes' evidence about the lack of sufficient signage during the by-election and general election. EC also made an admission about insufficient signage leading to entrance #2. Signage is particularly important given that most voters would be less familiar with the layout of their polling location than their home or workplace. EC consents to the Complainant's request that the Tribunal order that EC provide sufficient and appropriate signage at elections, including the universal accessibility symbol so that voters with disabilities can easily find the shortest and most appropriate route to all accessible entrances at polling stations. I order EC to do so, and consult with the other parties about same.\nTraining\n[89] Training materials and protocols can always be improved. Here, the problem was more of officials not following instructions, rather than the training itself. For example, Mr. Roussel testified that it was the job of the Central Poll Supervisor to check that the polling stations were in proper operation on election day, including that entrance #1 (the only accessible one) was open. However, the officials' non-application of the training instructions is also a factor of how they are trained. Better training, including its application, could prevent the recurrence of the comment by the EC official to Mr. Hughes about the lack of sufficient funding for accessible facilities during by-elections, and the lack of proper spacing of tables in polling stations.\n[90] Training about accessibility complaints and the proper handling of them by polling station officers and national headquarters should also be provided. I was surprised by Mr. Roussel's evidence concerning the lack of training about accessibility issues for the many public servants at EC's national headquarters who deal, in whole or in part, with disability and accessibility issues.\n[91] The Complainant and CCD request orders for the review and updating of training materials and training programs for all management, staff, and officers, full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary, dealing with accessibility issues. This would include the CEO at the apex of the pyramid of EC, down to the 200,000 election day officials. They also ask that the training materials include these Reasons for Decision (or a summary) and that it form the basis of a case study in the training sessions. I note that EC had an interactive session dealing with case studies in their training of ROs. EC agrees within twelve months to review its training materials and program for ROs and officials below them, but is concerned with extending it to the CEO. EC is also concerned about the logistical complexities of training the 200,000 temporary election day officials.\n[92] The training materials and programs or sessions should be reviewed, revised and updated concerning accessibility issues. Training should be given to every officer or employee who deals with disability and accessibility issues, including the CEO and senior management, the accessibility officers at national headquarters, the ROs and others in the electoral districts (i.e., the army of 200,000 election day officials). I note that in Lepofsky, supra the Tribunal ordered training for all appropriate officers and employees, including the Commissioners and senior management of the Toronto Transit Commission. The training may be customized to the individual, depending on his\/her responsibilities at EC. I also agree with the request that the materials include my Reasons for Decision or summary thereof, and a case study be made from it.\nAccessibility Complaints Process\n[93] The poor handling of Mr. Hughes' verbal and written complaints by EC, including its investigation, triggered liability and are of concern to me. EC agrees within six months to: Implement a procedure for receiving, recording and processing verbal and written complaints about lack of accessibility.\n[94] I agree that a public complaints process needs to be established by EC about accessibility issues. It should also be suitably publicized (e.g., in polling stations, on the EC website, on the Voter Information Card). It should include the tracking of complaints and their disposition. The number of complaints received about accessibility issues should be publicly reported, perhaps in the post-election report of the CEO. And of course, EC employees need to be trained regarding same.\n[95] It is important that the reporting of said complaints about lack of accessibility in polling locations and stations be done. EC consents to such a reporting requirement for a period of three complete general election cycles, as long as it may be implemented in a manner consistent with its operational constraints. It will be reported in the CEO's post-election report to Parliament. I order EC to do so, as per the terms set out in its counsel's October 23, 2009 letter to the Tribunal.\nExemptions Under Subsection 121(2) of the CEA\n[96] The Complainant requests an order that any such exemptions be reviewed with consultants from local disability groups and if found to be valid, publicly advertised, including the alternative arrangements for voters with disabilities. The CEO currently lists in his post-election report to Parliament the number of s. 121(2) exemptions given in the campaign period. Neither the Complainant nor CCD challenges the validity of s. 121(2). I do not find the discriminatory practice in which EC engaged in this case flowed from s. 121(2) or its operation and accordingly do not issue any future practices order concerning same.\nThree Month Suspension If Election Called\n[97] I agree to EC's request that the timelines and activities concerning the above remedies shall be suspended for a period of three months in the event of a general election. This is a reasonable request given the evidence I heard about the hectic schedule of EC national headquarters staff and riding officials when an election is called. Of course, this does not affect the award of compensation and interest, and the cease order.\nReporting to the Tribunal\n[98] EC shall report to me in at least three-month intervals about its progress in implementing my Order. The Commission is encouraged, but is not required, to periodically report to me about any matter relating to its monitoring of the implementation of my Order.19\nTribunal Staying Seized\n[99] The parties agree to the Tribunal staying seized of this matter. I will stay seized of this matter until my Order has been fully complied with, including the making of additional implementation orders or directions, as required. However, EC through its counsel's letter to the Tribunal dated October 23, 2009 consented to the phasing-in of a full reporting system over a 3-general election cycle. This could occur as late as 2020. I do not think it would be wise to remain seized for that long a period. Accordingly, I will stay seized to the later date of the reporting on the next general election and the implementation of the other parts of this Order, including any further implementation Orders.\nXVI. ORDER [100] Having found EC engaged in a discriminatory practice within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA, the Complaint of James Peter Hughes is substantiated and the following Order is made:\nCompensation and Interest\n(1) EC shall pay Mr. Hughes $10,000 for the pain and suffering experienced as a result of the discriminatory practice, per paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA, plus interest on the above amount, pursuant to rule 9(12) of the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and subsection 53(4) of the CHRA.\nMonitoring, Consultation, etc.\n(2) As per the Commission's offer, it will monitor the implementation of this Order, and any subsequent implementation Orders. EC will consult with the other parties (i.e., the Commission, the Complainant and CCD) about various aspects of my Order, including the implementation of them. EC will pay the reasonable expenses of CCD and the Complainant to participate in the implementation phase, but not legal fees in this proceeding.\nGreater Consultation with Voters with Disabilities\n(3) Within six months, EC shall formulate a plan for greater consultation with voters with disabilities and disability groups, upon discussion with the other parties.\nCease Order\n(4) EC shall cease from situating polling stations in locations that do not provide barrier-free access in any electoral district in Canada, within the meaning of section 5 of the CHRA. This is subject to the standard of bona fide justification and the duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship under paragraph 15(1)(g) and subsection 15(2) of the CHRA respectively, once a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\nVerification of Accessibility of Facilities\n(5) Within six months, EC shall implement a procedure for verification of the accessibility of facilities on the day of an electoral event, and consult with the other parties about same.\nPolicies and Guidelines\n(6) Within twelve months, EC shall review the Accessible Facilities Guide, Accessibility Checklist, and accessibility sections of the Manuals for the Returning Officers and the other categories of election workers (i.e., AROs, CPSs, DROs, Poll Clerks, Information Officers and Registration Officers). EC shall consult with the other parties about same.\nStandard Lease for Polling Locations\n(7) Within six months, EC shall revise its standard lease for polling locations to include the requirement that the leased premises provide level access and are barrier-free. EC shall consult with the other parties about same.\nSignage at Polling Locations and Stations\n(8) EC shall provide sufficient and appropriate signage at elections, including the universal accessibility symbol so that voters with disabilities can easily find the shortest and most appropriate route to all accessible entrances at polling stations. EC shall consult with the other parties about same.\nTraining\n(9) Within twelve months, EC shall review, revise and update its training materials and programs concerning accessibility issues for ROs and officials below them. Training should be given to every officer or employee who deals with disability and accessibility issues, including the CEO and senior management, the accessibility officers at national headquarters, the ROs and others in the electoral districts. The training may be customized to the individual, depending on his\/her responsibilities at EC. EC officials shall be trained also on the new public complaints process. The materials will also include these Reasons for Decision or a summary thereof, and a case study made from it for training purposes. EC shall consult with the other parties about same.\nAccessibility Complaints Process\n(10) Within six months, EC shall implement a procedure for receiving, recording and processing verbal and written complaints about lack of accessibility. It should also be suitably publicized (e.g., in polling stations, on the EC website, on the Voter Information Card). It should include the tracking of complaints and their disposition. The number of complaints received about accessibility issues should be publicly reported. EC shall execute this reporting requirement for a period of three complete general election cycles, in the CEO's post-election report to Parliament, and as per the terms set out in its counsel's October 23, 2009 letter to the Tribunal. EC shall consult with the other parties about same.\nThree Month Suspension If Election Called\n(11) The timelines and activities concerning the above remedies shall be suspended for a period of three months in the event of a general election, except for the award of compensation and interest, and the cease order.\nEC to Report to Tribunal\n(12) EC shall report to the Tribunal in at least three-month intervals about its progress in implementing this Order.\nTribunal Staying Seized\n(13) The Tribunal will remain seized in this matter to the later date of the reporting of accessibility complaints by EC after the next general election and the implementation of the other parts of this Order, including any further implementation Orders as required.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

DECISION\nI. COMPLAINT A. Physical Disability - Employment [1] Ms. Roopnarine was an employee of the Bank of Montreal (BMO) for 31 years. She joined BMO when she was 20 years old in 1975 and performed various jobs ranging from proof machine operator to data entry clerk to collector and fraud investigator. She was terminated by BMO on February 15, 2007 and was given a severance package. At this time she was on an accommodated leave of absence from work for a wrist injury. This leave was to be extended upon receipt of a medical report supporting an extension. BMO terminated her prior to receipt of this report. Ms. Roopnarine alleges that she was terminated because of her disability.\n[2] In particular, Ms. Roopnarine makes the following allegations: her performance until termination was competent and her performance appraisals prior to 2003 demonstrated this; her subsequent appraisals were incorrect and unfair; she was not accorded due process in the evaluation process and content, and that managers did not bring performance issues to her attention; when she had a wrist injury BMO used these evaluations as a pretext to terminate her when the real reason for her termination was because BMO did not want to accommodate her wrist injury.\nII. FINDINGS OF FACT A. Findings in this Case Work History\n[3] In January 2002, Ms. Roopnarine was seeking a promotion. She sought to move from the collections department into a more senior position as a fraud investigator. She was interviewed for this position but did not receive it. Then, still in January 2002, she applied for a position as a fraud analyst and obtained a lateral transfer into this position.\n[4] She worked in the mortgage fraud stream known as Gemini in the fraud detection unit. Her job was to investigate and analyze applications flagged as potentially involving mortgage fraud. For example, if the identity of a potential mortgage customer was at issue, she was to take steps to determine if the mortgage application was fraudulent or satisfactory. This investigation included reviewing information on the computer, speaking to the applicant's employer for verification purposes, checking if the SIN numbers and addresses matched, and analyzing the credit information. After conducting a thorough investigation, she was to make a determination as to whether fraud existed. If no fraud existed, the mortgage application was cleared. It was returned to another unit for the mortgage application to be confirmed as satisfactory to the potential mortgage customer. If she believed that there was evidence of fraud the file was routed to the unsatisfactory basket. If she incorrectly classified the mortgage application as unsatisfactory when it could have been verified as acceptable, BMO lost business as the mortgage customer's application was declined. BMO had a 24 hour window within which it expected that a mortgage customer would be advised if the application was accepted or declined.\n[5] BMO had 5 streams in the fraud unit including Gemini and CRDS. CRDS focused on detecting bank account fraud. CRDS was the most basic stream in which new employees and students were initially trained.\n[6] When Ms. Roopnarine was transferred in 2002, she maintained her grade and pay level and became the highest graded and highest paid employee in the fraud unit. From the date of transfer, she was given significant ongoing training over the years in both Gemini and CRDS. However, by May 2006 she still had not acquired the skills to perform the duties of a fraud analyst in either of these 2 streams. For her part, Ms. Roopnarine believed that she had been entitled to a promotion in a higher position as a fraud investigator since 2002. Yet, even as late as January 2007, she had been unable or unwilling to acquire the basic skill sets of even 2 of the 5 streams. Difficulties with her performance began to be documented in the 2003 -2004 year end review.\n[7] As per an interim 6 month progress review for the time period November 1, 2003 to April 30, 2004, she was having difficulty with both productivity and competence. She challenged this assessment and her year-end review for the period November 1, 2003 to October 31, 2004 fiscal year was graded as successfully meets expectations. That year-end appraisal acknowledged that she had made improvement in overall productivity since July of that year when managers removed some of her regular tasks to allow her time to focus on a comprehensive skills development plan. However, it also documented her reluctance to follow prescribed standards, the need for her to improve her skills and increase team efficiency and effectiveness, and her reluctance to receive and implement feedback. Rather than accepting that she needed to improve, Ms. Roopnarine became defensive. She initially refused to sign her 2003-2004 year-end performance appraisal in spite of numerous discussions and input from BMO staff. She also refused to attend meetings with managers to discuss her performance. Eventually she signed the appraisal and attached her personal notes regarding her performance.\n[8] BMO continued to provide her with training and support. Her 2004-2005 year-end review was again marked as successfully meets expectations and was more positive than that of the prior year. It confirmed that she had in-depth knowledge of Gemini and working knowledge of CRDS. Yet, it also confirmed that it was a priority to ensure that Ms. Roopnarine received more training to focus on continued development and enhancement of skills, and that it was mandatory to meet minimum department requirements. She signed and accepted this appraisal.\nPerformance Problems - Pre-wrist Injury\n[9] In April 2006 Ms. Jamie Khan became manager of the fraud unit. Ms. Khan had been employed with BMO for 24 years and had experience in loans, mortgages, fraud detection and investigation services.\n[10] As part of her management initiative, she met personally in one-on-one meetings with each of the 15 employees in the fraud unit to discuss their skills and objectives. Of her 15 member team, Ms. Khan observed, that excepting Ms. Roopnarine, each member was capable of working in a minimum of 3 of the 5 streams and that many members were competent to work in 4 of the 5 streams. Yet Ms. Roopnarine had worked primarily in only 1 stream, being Gemini.\n[11] Ms. Khan met with Ms. Roopnarine in about April 2006. Ms. Roopnarine told her that she was highly skilled and highly graded. She also told Ms. Khan that she was disappointed with being passed over for a promotion to the position of fraud investigator in a different area in 2002. Ms. Khan told her that she was happy to work with her to improve and expand her skill set so that she would be better qualified for future opportunities. Accordingly, in order to improve her knowledge of more streams and to bring her skill set up to par with her more junior peers, Ms. Khan told Ms. Roopnarine that she would begin by moving her to CRDS. Ms. Khan indicated that once Ms. Roopnarine mastered the skills in this stream and worked satisfactorily in this stream, she would move her back to Gemini to upgrade her skills there as well. She moved Ms. Roopnarine to CRDS on May 11, 2006.\n[12] In CRDS Ms. Khan provided Ms. Roopnarine with intensive training from May 12 to 26, 2006, during which time a trainer sat with her at her desk to guide her, and showed her how to produce CRDS reports, how to deal with international withdrawals and how to report her work on downloads to managers. Ms. Roopnarine was to investigate and identify skimming in customer bank accounts. ``Skimming'' refers to credit card fraud whereby criminals remove money from bank accounts. The day shift analyst was responsible for downloading the system at 8:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. and reviewing the flagged accounts to verify them for skimming.\n[13] Both Gemini and CRDS required the analyst to start the computer and use the mouse and keyboard to view the identified accounts. The analyst typed in a number and obtained information. There was minimal distinction between the physical requirements of the jobs. However, CRDS required more accounts to be processed. While in CRDS, Ms. Roopnarine continued to work occasionally in Gemini. Despite receiving CRDS training and other ongoing coaching from Ms. Khan, Ms. Roopnarine was unable or unwilling to cope with the CRDS work. She failed to follow procedures. She did not work the necessary minimum number of accounts and failed to follow the downloading schedule.\n[14] Ms. Roopnarine recognized her performance issues and within the first few months of being assigned to CRDS she asked Ms. Khan to return her to Gemini where it was more difficult to evaluate her underperformance. Ms. Roopnarine continued to complain to Ms. Khan that she was dissatisfied for not having received a raise and a promotion.\n[15] Between May 2006 and October 2006 Ms. Khan met with Ms. Roopnarine on numerous occasions, and sometimes in the presence of Ms. Kahn's manager, Ms. Coupland. Ms. Khan repeatedly offered Ms. Roopnarine constructive criticism, in regard to both CRDS and Gemini. Ms. Kahn told her that she was not fully investigating suspected fraud, and that she worked randomly rather than systematically as required. Concomitantly, she also offered Ms. Roopnarine continued training and assistance in a supportive manner. On June 1, 2006, Ms. Roopnarine agreed with Ms. Khan that once she met the CRDS performance expectations, Ms. Khan would return her to Gemini. In spite of agreeing to the same, Ms. Roopnarine continued to complain into September 2006 that her experience, knowledge and skills were not a fit with her role in CRDS, and that she wished to return to Gemini. She did not complain about work duties as they related to any wrist injury.\n[16] After 5 months in the CRDS stream, in spite of having received in-depth training and coaching, feedback and continued ongoing assistance, Ms. Roopnarine was unable to perform the job. She had technical challenges and poor productivity: she worked 7.5 accounts per hour as opposed to the department standard of 25-35 accounts per hour. Several times she neglected to work the full set of CRDS and worked randomly. She also had technical challenges. For example, in June 2006, she again dragged a master file for CRDS into the wrong folder which resulted in lost productivity for the rest of the analysts who could not locate it and thus could not work on other accounts. When Ms. Khan confronted her with these issues she continued to insist that she be returned to Gemini. She received no performance pay or base pay increases for 2006.\nWrist Pain & Prior Accommodation\n[17] During her employment, Ms. Roopnarine had a number of disability issues that required accommodation. BMO is a large employer, and in accordance with its accommodation policies managed by Oncidium Health Group (Oncidium) it accommodated Ms. Roopnarine in 2003 when she requested and received a modification of her workstation for an injury. BMO had a contract with a third party to provide disability management which party interacted with Oncidium. Oncidium was responsible for evaluating requests for accommodation and ensuring that all requests for accommodation were evaluated fairly and impartially.\n[18] The first time Ms. Roopnarine told Ms. Khan that she was experiencing pain in her wrist was on October 5, 2006 in a casual conversation. At the time Ms. Roopnarine recorded her conversation in her diary. In response Ms. Khan told her to submit medical evidence in support of a request for accommodation and that she would honour whatever the doctor said. Ms. Roopnarine contacted human resources and then Oncidium and received the medical forms to be completed by her physician on October 11, 2006. Ms. Roopnarine forwarded her doctor's statement dated October 17, 2006 to Oncidium. The statement stated that she had wrist pain of a chronic and acute nature and that BMO should limit her time on the computer to 4 hours per day. The statement did not specify the duration of time for which the accommodation was required. It did indicate that the physician had referred her to a neurologist. Ms. Roopnarine dealt directly with Oncidium regarding her wrist issues. Ms. Khan was not involved in evaluating accommodation requests.\n2006 Performance Appraisal\n[19] As Ms. Roopnarine's manager, Ms. Khan was required to prepare her 2006 performance review with respect to her work from November 1, 2005 to October 31, 2006. She followed BMO's policy in performing this assessment. She sought input from Ms. Roopnarine. In mid October 2006 Ms. Khan again met with Ms. Roopnarine to advise her that she was not meeting standards and to provide her with coaching to help her meet those standards.\n[20] Unfortunately, on October 19, 2006, Ms. Roopnarine was involved in a motor vehicle accident and took a medical leave of absence from work due to injuries she sustained in that accident. She received short term disability (STD) benefits. She returned to work on November 14, 2006. On November 16, 2006, Oncidium advised Ms. Khan that the medical information provided by Ms. Roopnarine was insufficient to support accommodation for her wrist injury. After her return to work from STD leave Ms. Roopnarine complained casually about her wrist to Ms. Khan. Ms. Khan was aware that Ms. Roopnarine was dealing with Oncidium regarding accommodation for her wrist injury. Ms. Khan awaited its direction. At this time, Ms. Roopnarine was dealing separately with Oncidiun and told her doctor to provide his complete files to Oncidium.\n[21] On November 16, 2006 Ms. Khan requested that Ms. Roopnarine prepare a self-assessment of her performance. Ms. Roopnarine wrote a glowing self-assessment using abstract language and including such phrases as negotiates for a win-win situation by influencing strategies tailored to business situations and structuring agreements to meet both parties' objectives. She failed to assess her own performance in concrete terms regarding the number of accounts she investigated and downloaded in either Gemini or CRDS streams and the quality of her investigations. Her self-assessment was difficult to understand and inaccurate.\n[22] Ms. Khan also consulted with Ms. Roopnarine's prior managers to assess the first half of the fiscal year, because Ms. Khan had only been her manager since April, 2006. Based on that feedback Ms. Kahn documented Ms. Roopnarine's prior difficulties in Gemini as: Tara has had some challenges with presentation, mitigation, and analysis of applications. Her applications were not thoroughly investigated and followed up upon in timely manner, and often times the applications were placed in `unable to mitigate' stage which resulted in a loss of business to BMO. In spite of coaching, Ms. Roopnarine did not take corrective action to improve her performance. Post April 2006, Ms.Kahn documented that in spite of receiving 5 months of training Ms. Roopnarine was still in the learning category in CRDS. She had some challenges adhering to CRDS schedule and downloads.\n[23] Essentially, Ms. Roopnarine did not follow the download schedule, created technical problems, neglected to investigate the full set of accounts, and worked randomly rather than systematically as directed. As a result, there were gaps in the work that she performed and the work of subsequent shifts was negatively affected. While Ms. Roopnarine received a few congratulatory emails regarding her work performance during this fiscal period, two from Ms. Khan, these were part of a broader employee encouragement program known as Bravo, and did not reflect individual employee performance. Ms. Roopnarine had not acquired the necessary skills to work in CRDS and Gemini. This did not meet BMOs objectives of ensuring that all analysts could work in most of the streams, thereby allowing for flexibility of scheduling and comprehensive analysis and knowledge of the unit. For this reason Ms. Khan assessed Ms. Roopnarine's work to be substandard to her peers. Accordingly, she graded her as contribution below expectations.\n[24] Next, Ms. Khan met with Ms. Coupland and discussed the performance appraisal. Ms. Coupland signed it on November 30, 2006 and wrote, stay focused on your development opportunities and accept the coaching [from] a positive perspective. Then Ms. Khan signed it on December 18, 2006 and met with Ms. Roopnarine the same day, at which time she gave her a hard copy to discuss it with her. Ms. Khan had set aside 1 hour to discuss the appraisal. However, within 2 minutes Ms. Roopnarine told Ms. Khan that she wished to discuss it only with Ms. Coupland. Ms. Roopnarine refused to sign the appraisal. She said she wanted a ``soft'' or electronic copy of the document. Ms. Khan declined to provide a ``soft'' copy to her because in the past Ms. Roopnarine had altered and rewritten portions of Ms. Khan's emails. Ms. Khan did not want her original appraisal document altered. Ms. Khan agreed to arrange a meeting with Ms. Coupland.\n[25] Thereafter, Ms. Roopnarine's performance difficulties continued. During December 2006, Ms. Khan continued to receive emails from other managers complaining about Ms. Roopnarine's performance. For example, in December 2006, 39 of BMO's accounts were subject to a fraud hit being a situation wherein a number of accounts were `skimmed' of monies; yet, Ms. Roopnarine had not identified any of these accounts as being in need of investigation for potential fraud. She continued to underperform. For example, in mid December 2006, on a particular day she worked only 28 minutes.\nAccommodation Process\n[26] Meanwhile, Ms. Roopnarine's physician sent to Oncidium on December 27, 2006, a written report outlining the length of time he had been her physician and advising that Ms. Roopnarine required modified duties in the form of working no more than 4 hours per day on the mouse and keyboard. On January 2, 2007, after receipt of the medical report from Ms. Roopnarine's physician, Oncidium advised BMO that it had approved accommodation for the Complainant's wrist injury for the period of January 2, 2007 to February 4, 2007. Oncidium also advised Ms. Roopnarine and BMO that additional and updated medical information was required to substantiate accommodation beyond February 4, 2007.\n[27] Ms. Khan immediately accommodated Ms. Roopnarine by approving a reduction in her work on the computer from 7.5 to 4 consecutive hours in a working day in CRDS. Because the fraud unit was completely computerized, BMO did not provide her with additional duties for the 3.5 hours per day, but paid her for the full day of work. As well, in January 2007, BMO modified Ms. Roopnarine's work schedule to allow her to attend physiotherapy appointments pertaining to injuries she sustained in her motor vehicle accident.\nMeeting with Ms. Coupland\n[28] As requested by Ms. Roopnarine, on January 10, 2007, Ms. Coupland and Ms. Khan met with Ms. Roopnarine to discuss the 2006 appraisal. Ms. Roopnarine continued to complain about her past 5 years of employment, and how she had been denied a promotion. There was not much discussion regarding the appraisal. A few minutes into the meeting, Ms. Roopnarine told Ms. Coupland: Jamie's a liar referring to Ms. Khan. Both Ms. Khan and Ms. Coupland were shocked. As a result, Ms. Khan remained silent for the rest of the meeting. About 1 hour into the discussion, Ms. Coupland became impatient and told Ms. Roopnarine to get to the point of the meeting, while pointing at the table. Following the meeting, Ms. Coupland sent an email to Ms. Roopnarine stating, Your behavior in our meeting today in calling Jamie a liar is completely unacceptable. An apology was not forthcoming from you at any time during the meeting. Jamie has spent considerable time with you since she arrived as your Manager and has demonstrated outstanding patience with you at a cost of not spending the time she should be spending with other members of your team. Ms. Coupland stated that Ms. Roopnarine continued to focus on the past and continued to blame others for her own performance. These behaviours had used up 90% of the meeting time.\n[29] The same day Ms. Roopnarine then telephoned Ms. Coupland's manager, Ms. Penny to request a meeting. Meanwhile, Ms. Khan, disregarding the accusation of being a liar, continued to treat Ms. Roopnarine in a positive and helpful manner.\n[30] However, when Ms. Roopnarine did not apologize for her behavior at any time, either during the meeting or after Ms. Coupland's email, Ms. Coupland and Ms. Penny made a decision to terminate Ms. Roopnarine. BMO's employment policies expressly contemplated termination either for cause, or with notice and a severance package in lieu of notice. The disciplinary policies encapsulated a multi-step approach to terminations for cause, but allowed for managerial discretion to move to termination without prior warning in some cases. As Ms. Roopnarine was a long service employee and it would have been difficult to terminate her for cause in the legal sense, BMO chose to terminate her without cause. It chose to provide her with a severance package and pay in lieu of notice.\n[31] Just prior to the termination date, Oncidium advised Ms. Khan on February 13, 2007, that no further medical documentation had been received to support the extension of accommodation beyond February 4, 2007 and that Oncidium was awaiting an outstanding medical report as it was aware that Ms. Roopnarine had an upcoming appointment with a specialist.\n[32] On February 15, 2007 Ms. Coupland terminated Ms. Roopnarine and provided her a termination letter dated the same day. Ms. Khan was not involved in this decision. Ms. Coupland's letter stated: ...this will confirm that your employment with BMO will be terminated with appropriate severance effective February 15, 2007. As per the letter BMO provided her with a severance package of salary continuation for 95 weeks from February 16, 2007 to December 12, 2008. The value of the salary continuation was $86,955.00. She also received a payment of $2,952.00, representing the incentive pay component of her severance pay to be paid at the conclusion of the salary continuation period, and benefits continuation and ongoing accrual of pension contributions for 95 weeks and outplacement counselling.\nPost Termination\n[33] Ms. Roopnarine had seen the neurologist in January 2007 and his report dated March 13, 2007 was sent to Oncidium later that month. This report confirmed that she had a repetitive strain injury and that there was no definitive evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.\n[34] Ms. Roopnarine was then involved in a 2nd motor vehicle accident on April 19, 2007. She commenced a civil action against the owner and operator of another vehicle involved in that collision claiming damages in the amount of $1,500,000.00 ($600,000.0 for general damages and $900,000.00 for special damages). She alleged that she had suffered significant physical injuries.\n[35] As of the date of hearing being January 25, 2010, Ms. Roopnarine had not obtained employment since her termination at BMO. She made efforts to mitigate her wage loss through searching for other employ.\nB. Agreed Facts and Access to Justice [36] Through active pre-hearing case management and exploration of the issues with counsel at the opening of the hearing, a number of facts were agreed to by both counsel. This agreement of facts expedited the hearing which presumably resulted in a direct cost benefit to the parties in reduced legal fees. This is particularly important given the decision of Canada (Attorney General) v. Mowat, 2009 FCA 309 in which the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to award legal fees to successful Complainants, and given that there is no provision for awarding legal fees to Respondents or unsuccessful Complainants. The agreement also focused the hearing for the Tribunal and resulted in a reduced number of issues. Also, the medical evidence of both the general practitioner and the neurologist was entered without the need to subpoena these doctors, who were reluctant to attend the hearing, and thereby saved both parties monies that would likely have been expended to cover the costs to have them testify. Instead, the affidavit of Ms. Roopnarine's family physician was tendered for the truth of its contents and BMO waived its right to cross-examine him. Finally, the parties agreed that only two witnesses would testify: Ms. Roopnarine and Ms. Khan.\nC. Dispute over Factual Issues [37] In making the above findings of fact I carefully considered all of the evidence. There was a startling discrepancy between the evidence of Ms. Roopnarine and that of Ms. Khan with respect to performance issues, Ms. Roopnarine's conduct, and the termination. I chose to accept the evidence of Ms. Khan when it conflicted with that of Ms. Roopnarine for a number of reasons: In spite of a lengthy and exhaustive cross-examination by Ms. Roopnarine's counsel, Ms. Kahn remained calm and candid. Over-all, I found Ms. Khan to be forthright, clear and consistent. I found her to be fair and balanced. For example, Ms. Khan acknowledged that Ms. Roopnarime had complained to her about her wrist in November 2006. I found Ms. Khan's testimony to accord with the documentary evidence. I found her to be independent in that while she was Ms. Roopnarine's manager and had assessed her performance appraisal as falling below expectations, she did not make the final decision to terminate her. This decision was made by her manager, Ms. Coupland. I also found that in her testimony she demonstrated no agitation or hostility towards Ms. Roopnarine in recalling how Ms. Roopnarine called her a liar. On the whole, I found Ms. Khan's evidence to be inherently consistent.\n[38] On the other hand, I had difficulty with Ms. Roopnarine's evidence for a number of reasons. While Mr. McKillop is a lawyer of significant skill, I found his cross examination of Ms. Roopnarine to be fair and respectful. He repeatedly gave her an opportunity to change her evidence and made a genuine effort to understand her evidence and to ensure that it was not misrepresented. Yet, Ms. Roopnarine refused repeatedly to answer mundane questions in a candid manner with a yes or no answer. For example, upon being shown her job description, she refused to confirm the duties of her position as outlined until repeatedly being requested to do so. She refused to acknowledge that her identification of a mortgage as potentially fraudulent resulted in the denial of the mortgage application until repeatedly being asked questions about the process. She was guarded and defensive throughout the cross-examination. Eventually, she acknowledged that she did not advise Ms. Khan of her wrist injury until October 2006. At the end of cross-examination, she finally admitted that her 2004 performance problems, her 2005 performance problems and her performance problems in Gemini for the first 6 months of 2006 were unrelated to her wrist injury.\n[39] I also found Ms. Roopnarine's evidence to contain numerous inconsistencies: for example, she changed her evidence numerous times in cross examination after she was given an opportunity to do so. She denied that she had been given much training in CRDS, and when confronted with the detailed notes of the May 2006 4-week training session made to fellow employees, she eventually accepted that she had received some of that training, could not recall some of it, and denied much of it. I compared this evidence to Ms. Khan's evidence that such training was provided, which evidence was consistent with the notes of the trainer outlining concrete instruction given. On another point, Ms. Roopnarine denied being upset with the 2006 appraisal even though she complained about it to Ms. Coupland and then to Ms. Penny.\n[40] Ms. Roopnarine denied that she had performance issues in her testimony in chief and in cross-examination initially. Later in cross-examination she conceded that she made mistakes in 2004. Yet, she immediately insisted on making differentiations between carelessness and a mistake. Initially, she denied absolutely that she had any performance problems from 2004 onwards. Mr. McKillop took her through 25 incidents and in cross-examination she acknowledged a number of them. For example, she signed the 2005 performance appraisal and agreed that she needed to improve her skills to meet minimum department standards. Initially, she denied that she failed to follow directions and procedure, but later admitted the same. After much questioning, she finally acknowledged that she agreed with her trainer's recommendation in June 2006 that she needed to focus on working CRDS to maintain accuracy in downloading and in sending out alerts. She eventually accepted that she was told in June 2006 that she had dragged a master file from CRDS, but denied that this created significant problems for others who could not therefore access it. She stated that the technical problem was corrected within 15 to 20 minutes by the IT department whereas Ms. Khan stated that the problem took 1.5 days to resolve.\n[41] Significantly, she denied that she had called Ms. Khan a liar, even though an email confirming such an event had been sent by Ms. Coupland to Ms. Penny copied to Ms. Khan shortly after the meeting and a hard copy had been given to Ms. Roopnarine. She did not demonstrate that the email was unreliable. In cross-examination Ms. Roopnarine initially refused to acknowledge that calling a manager a liar was a serious matter, but then conceded that such conduct would be unacceptable.\n[42] She exaggerated her evidence. For example, she implied that she was responsible for designing part of the process at Gemini when there is no evidence that someone at her level would have been involved in design. Another example that I found striking was her glowing 2006 self-assessment: she used abstract high level language to describe her work rather than providing concrete examples of her skills. I found this effort to place a positive face on her performance to be disingenuous. I also found it difficult to believe that she had not seen her civil statement of claim pertaining to her April 2007 accident, and that she did not know the status of that action. For that matter, I had directed her counsel in her presence in a pre-hearing conference to contact Ms. Roopnarine's separate counsel in the civil litigation to obtain and produce relevant documentation. On the whole, I did not find her credible. I found many inconsistencies in her evidence.\nD. New Evidence Regarding Submissions Pertaining to Cutbacks [43] Ms. Roopnarine's counsel had not prepared written argument at the close of the hearing and requested an opportunity to file written submissions. I agreed to give him this opportunity. In those submissions and emails, Ms. Roopnarine's counsel argued that Mr. McKillop could not argue that the reason for Ms. Roopnarine's termination was relevant to a broader BMO policy to terminate non-performing employees in the particular economic climate as it had not been raised in BMO's particulars. I agree with Ms. Roopnarine's counsel that the first time the issue pertaining to alleged cutbacks arose was at the hearing, and that was mostly in argument. Accordingly I place no weight on this aspect of BMO's argument.\nE. Commission Investigation Report [44] The Commission's investigation report was tendered by consent in these proceedings. While Ms. Roopnarine's counsel's arguments relied upon factual findings and conclusions made in the Commission's investigation report to support her position, I place no weight on its factual findings and conclusions. I rely on the evidence tendered at the hearing.\nIII. LAW A. Establishing a Prima Facie Case of Discrimination [45] Section 7 of the Act legislates that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an employee, or in the course of employment to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Disability is included amongst the list of prohibited grounds of discrimination set out in s. 3 of the Act. According to s. 25, disability, for the purposes of the Act, means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\n[46] In a human rights case before this Tribunal, the Complainant must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a decision in favour of the Complainant, in the absence of an answer from the Respondent. The Respondent's answer should not be considered in the determination of whether the Complainant has made out a prima facie case of discrimination. (See Ontario (Human Rights Commission) and O'Malley v. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R 536; and Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204.) It has been held that the allegations made by the Complainant have to be credible in order to support a conclusion that a prima facie case exists, Dhanjal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37 at para. 6).\nB. Defences [47] Once a prima facie case of discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the Respondent to demonstrate that the alleged discrimination either did not occur as alleged or that the conduct was somehow non-discriminatory or justified. (Maillet v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 CHRT 48, para. 4; CHRA, s. 15). See also Canada v. Lambie 1996 CanLii 3940 (F.C.). When dealing with course of conduct as opposed to transaction driven by pre-existing policy one should start by examining whether the transaction between parties, taken as a whole, results in adverse treatment on a prohibited ground (Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment) (C.A.), 2003 FCA 133, [2003] 4 F.C. 580). It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions in issue for a Complainant to succeed. It is sufficient that the discrimination be but one basis for the employer's actions or decisions. (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1990) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (F.C.A.))\nC. Evidence [48] The jurisprudence recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by way of direct evidence. As was noted in Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (C.H.R.T.), discrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed overtly. In fact, there are rarely cases where one can show by direct evidence that discrimination is purposely practised. Rather, one must consider all of the circumstances to determine if there exists the subtle scent of discrimination.\n[49] Fundamentally, however, the Complainant in this case must establish a link between her disability and the employer's decision to terminate her employment (Mills v. Culp Transport Inc. 2009 CHRT 17). (See also Benoit c. Bell Canada, 2005 CF 926 at paras. 15-16).\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Did Ms. Roopnarine Establish Discrimination? (i) Termination of Employment a) Prima Facie Case Established [50] BMO conceded that, at the time of termination, Ms. Roopnarine suffered from a disability being a wrist injury involving repetitive strain and a specialist's report was outstanding to extend the accommodation period. Regarding other injuries, Ms. Roopnarine did not allege that she was not accommodated for the injuries she sustained as a result of the October 19, 2006 motor vehicle accident: indeed she conceded that she took a medical leave of absence from work and received STD benefits. In Ms. Roopnarine's counsel's written submissions, her counsel referred to her neck, shoulder, hand and finger injuries at the time of termination. Yet, the only medical evidence proffered by Ms. Roopnarine's family physician dealt exclusively with her hand and wrist injuries. In pre-hearing conferences both counsel agreed that the only injuries at issue in this hearing were her wrist injuries involving repetitive strain.\n[51] Ms. Roopnarine's fundamental argument as outlined in the Statement of Particulars and argued at the opening of the hearing was that BMO terminated her suddenly and unexpectedly while she was suffering from her wrist injury, was on an accommodated leave for that injury, was receiving physiotherapy for her disability, and was awaiting a specialist's report to have the accommodation period extended. At the time of her termination she was experiencing wrist pain consistent with a repetitive strain injury. No functional analysis had been performed.\n[52] As none of these facts are significantly contested by BMO I find that Ms. Roopnarine established a prima facie case of discrimination on the basis of disability.\nb) Reasonable Non-Pretextual Explanation Proffered [53] However, I find that BMO tendered a reasonable non-pretextual explanation for her termination. Ms. Roopnarine's wrist injury was not a factor in the termination decision. Rather, Ms. Roopnarine was a difficult employee who believed that she was entitled to a promotion and pay raise based on her years of service and salary grade. She set her goals on being promoted into a senior fraud investigator position. However, she was unwilling or unable to meet the minimum standards of a junior fraud analyst. She could not or would not master the most basic skills of CRDS. She refused to accept constructive criticism. Therefore Ms. Roopnarine sought to return to Gemini where it would be more difficult to identify her performance shortcomings. Even there, she had failed to conduct thorough and competent mortgage assessments in the past and still required further training. She refused to sign her 2006 performance appraisal. She refused to discuss her shortcomings with Ms. Khan. Instead she chose to escalate the complaint to Ms. Khan's manager. Precipitously, she opened the meeting by stating, Jamie is a liar, referring to Ms. Khan. Even though the meeting continued for an hour, she did not apologize for her statement either then or after. Ms. Khan had treated Ms. Roopnarine with unremitting patience and had provided her with daily personal assistance, as well as extensive and ongoing training. Ms. Coupland decided that BMO would not tolerate such disrespect by an employee towards a competent, personable and intelligent manager. I do not find this decision to be discriminatory.\n[54] Throughout, BMO gave Ms. Khan extensive feedback regarding its concerns about her performance.\n[55] Given Ms. Roopnarine's conduct at the January 10, 2007 meeting, coupled with her performance difficulties and reluctance to follow procedures, BMO chose to terminate her. Given that she was a long term employee, BMO decided to provide her with notice and a severance package.\n[56] Ms. Roopnarine's performance problems were unrelated to her wrist injury and pre-dated it. Ms. Roopnarine sought to return to Gemini so that her underperformance would be more difficult to evaluate. She did not seek to return because there was less typing and because such accommodation was necessary to accommodate her wrist injury. While there may have been less typing in Gemini, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that a return to Gemini was required to accommodate her wrist injury. Her family physician did not request such accommodation. BMO provided Ms. Roopnarine with the accommodation outlined by her doctor in CRDS.\n[57] BMO accepted its responsibility to accommodate Ms. Roopnarine. Indeed BMO accommodated Ms. Roopnarine following a car accident she sustained on October 19, 2006. Due to medical issues arising from her accident, she was absent from work and received STD benefits. In January 2007, BMO modified Ms. Roopnarine's work schedule to allow her to attend physiotherapy appointments pertaining to injuries she sustained in her motor vehicle accident. There was no evidence indicating that BMO's efforts to accommodate her car accident injuries were in insufficient. From January 2, 2007 to the date of termination, BMO accommodated Ms. Roopnarine's wrist injury by limiting her time on the computer to 4 hours per day, as directed by her physician. Further, the conduct of Ms. Khan and Ms. Coupland towards Ms. Roopnarine was not affected by Oncidium's evaluation process.\n[58] Nor is this case about whether Ms. Roopnarine had the physical abilities to perform her work. Her physical abilities played no role in BMO's decision to terminate her. The only factors were her performance and attitude.\n[59] In short I find BMO's conduct and explanation for termination reasonable and not linked to Ms. Roopnarine's wrist injury. I find it genuine, and non-pretextual. I have carefully examined the evidence for the subtle scent of discrimination to determine whether BMO used Ms. Roopnarine's poor performance as a pretext to terminate her, and whether Ms. Roopnarine's performance problems were caused by or were exacerbated by her wrist injury. Neither was the case here. Employers are not precluded from terminating employees with a disability for non-discriminatory reasons, such as substandard performance unrelated to the disability. (Crouse v. Canadian Steamship Lines Inc., 2001 CanLII 8493 (C.H.R.T.) and Coulter v. Purolator Courier Ltd., 2004 CHRT 37. See also Desormeaux v Ottawa, 2005 FCA, 311.) On a balance of probabilities, Ms. Roopnarine's physical limitations played no role in BMO's decision to terminate her.\n(ii) Adverse Differential Treatment in the Course of Employment a) No Prima Facie Case Established [60] Ms. Roopnarine's case revolved around the termination and how the pre-termination conduct led to the alleged discriminatory termination. Ms. Roopnarine did not argue in her Statement of Particulars that there was adverse differentiation during the pre-termination period. However, I raised this period with both counsel at the hearing. As it was left for argument, I choose to address this period in this decision for the sake of being complete.\n[61] I do not find that Ms. Roopnarine established a prima facie case of discrimination prior to termination from October 2006 onward. Section 7(b) prohibits adverse differentiation during the course of employment. In establishing a discriminatory practice, Ms. Roopnarine's perception or belief is not sufficient to establish the same: Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 CHRT 32, at para. 41, aff'd, 2006 FC 785.\n[62] After examining all of the evidence for the subtle scent of discrimination, I do not find that BMO treated her in a discriminatory fashion during her employment and after she advised Ms. Khan of her of wrist injury on October 5, 2006. To the contrary, Ms. Khan made every effort to work with her to improve her skill set to facilitate future growth opportunities. Ms. Roopnarine's performance issues and attitude had been a concern for BMO since 2004. Ms. Roopnarine refused to accept criticism and direction, and in spite of training, failed to improve in an entry level position at CRDS. On a balance of probabilities, her October 2006 wrist injury played no role in the ongoing efforts by Ms. Khan to assist and direct her.\n[63] During the hearing, I specifically asked counsel if Oncidion's requirement for medical information was a live issue in the case. Ms. Roopnarine's counsel stated that it was a live issue, in that BMO ought reasonably to have known that Ms. Roopnarine had a disability from May 2006, and at least from October 2006 onward, and ought not to have required further medical information and should have provided accommodation sooner. In spite of Ms. Roopnarine's counsel's oral submissions, this issue was not raised in Ms. Roopnarine's statement of particulars. BMO always understood that the case was about the termination and expressed surprise about late disclosure of this issue. Accordingly it is not properly before me. Contrary to her counsel's position, Ms. Roopnarine testified that she was satisfied with the Oncidium medical disclosure process.\n[64] Further, BMO's accommodation process was consistent with its duty to accommodate an employee claiming a disability. The Complainant, as part of her duty to facilitate the search for accommodation, has an obligation to comply with the employer's reasonable request for relevant medical information: Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 CHRT 8. As soon as the report was received by Oncidium, it communicated this information to BMO staff, and BMO adhered to the accommodation as suggested by Ms. Roopnarine's physician. (See also Wong v. Royal Bank of Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (C.H.R.T.))\n[65] Oncidium and BMO acted in good faith throughout their dealings with Ms. Roopnarine.\n[66] Ms. Roopnarine argued at the hearing and in her written submissions filed after the hearing that Oncidium unilaterally imposed an expiry date of February 4, 2007 for her accommodation period. I do not find this restriction unreasonable as Ms. Roopnarine's physician had confirmed in his October 17, 2006 statement that she was to see a specialist. When his December 27, 2006 letter confirmed that this appointment was scheduled for January 18, 2007 it was not unreasonable for Oncidium to expect it by February 4, 2007 to address continued accommodation. Further, nothing turns on this as BMO did not stop the accommodation as of that date but continued to accommodate her to the termination date.\n[67] Regarding Ms. Roopnarine's allegation that BMO failed to conduct a functional analysis prior to terminating her, I have already found that BMO did not terminate her because of her disability but due to her poor performance and attitude.\n[68] With respect to her argument that BMO should have returned her to Gemini where her wrist injury would have been better accommodated, there is insufficient medical evidence that a return to Gemini would have assisted her to reduce wrist pain. Her physician restricted her from prolonged use of mouse and keyboard, defining prolonged use as being for more than 4 hours. Ms. Khan chose for reasonable management reasons to have Ms. Roopnarine master CRDS entry level skills, and she reasonably accommodated Ms. Roopnarine in the CRDS position by complying with the restrictions. Ms. Roopnarine continued to seek to return to Gemini because she was not succeeding in CRDS, and her work was harder to monitor in Gemini. As discussed above, her request to return to Gemini was not a request for accommodation of her wrist injury.\n[69] From January 2, 2007 onwards, Ms. Roopnarine was to work only 4 hours per day out of a 7.5 hour day. BMO paid her for the 3 hours that she did not work. Regarding Ms. Roopnarine's argument that BMO ought to have given her additional non-computerized work for the rest of the day, the medical report did not outline such a form of accommodation. It stated only that she be limited to not more than 4 hours per day on the mouse and keyboard. Ms. Roopnarine did not tell BMO until this hearing that she sought to spread the 4 hours per day over the 7.5 hour day. Thus she failed in her obligation to provide BMO with notice of her desired accommodation and requisite medical evidence supporting the request. (See Tweten v. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 CHRT 8.) Further, while the accommodation process is an individualized one, the Complainant cannot expect a perfect solution: McGill University Health Centre (Montreal General Hospital) v. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 SCC 4, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 161, at para. 22. No authority was presented to me that BMO had an obligation under the CHRA to create work for the Complainant.\n[70] Finally, Ms. Roopnarine argued that BMO raised performance issues only after she indicated that she had a wrist injury. This allegation is contrary to the evidence that Ms. Roopnarine had performance issues of concern to BMO since 2004, and that these issues continued to the date of termination. Ms. Khan acted reasonably and patiently with Ms. Roopnarine throughout her dealings with her. She was genuinely open to assisting Ms. Roopnarine with accommodation. She provided her with continuous constructive feedback and training to help her to improve her skills. Nor do I accept that Ms. Coupland acted in a discriminatory manner towards Ms. Roopnarine.\nb) Reasonable Explanation Proffered [71] Even if the evidence could be viewed as establishing a prima facie case, BMO provided reasonable non-pretextual reasons for its conduct from October 2006 to termination as outlined above.\nc) No Freestanding Duty to Accommodate [72] Finally, a Complainant cannot make a free-standing claim that BMO discriminated against her by not accommodating her wrist injury. A failure to accommodate is neither a prohibited ground of discrimination nor a discriminatory practice under the CHRA. There is no free-standing right to accommodation under the CHRA. The duty to accommodate only arises in the context of s. 15(2) of the CHRA and only when a Respondent raises a bona fide justification by way of defense to an allegation of discrimination. [Graham v. Canada Post 2007 CHRT 40]\nV. DECISION [73] For these reasons I conclude that BMO terminated Ms. Roopnarine for performance issues. Her disability, being a wrist injury involving repetitive strain, was not a factor in that termination decision.\n[74] Regarding issues of accommodation prior to dismissal, I find that BMO tried to accommodate her and did accommodate her with respect to her wrist injury in an appropriate manner. BMO requested her to provide her physician's medical report clearly outlining the form of accommodation required. Immediately upon receipt of the same it accommodated her by limiting her time using the mouse and key board to 4 hours or less per day. BMO staff did not treat her in a discriminatory fashion during her employment.\n[75] Accordingly I dismiss the complaint, as it has not been substantiated. I have considered the evidence both discretely and collectively and find no breach of section 7 of the CHRA.\nSigned by\nShirish P.

Introduction [1] The Canadian National Railway (CN) brought a motion on January 19th, 2010, pursuant to Rule 3(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal's Rules of Procedure requesting that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) reopen the hearing in the matters of Kasha A. Whyte vs. Canadian National Railway and Cindy Richards vs. Canadian National Railway, so that CN can adduce additional evidence that was not available at the time of the hearing.\nII. Facts Relevant to the motion A. Complaints of Cindy Richards and Kasha Whyte [2] Cindy Richards and Kasha Whyte filed complaints alleging that CN had breached section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) on the prohibited ground of family status. By consent, both cases were consolidated for hearing before the Tribunal. The hearing took place on September 22 to 24, October 6 to 9, 22, and 26 to 30 and on November 12 and 13. Except for October 22, when the hearing was held in Ottawa to accommodate one of CN's witnesses, the place of hearing was Jasper, Alberta.\n[3] Although this motion does not deal directly with that case, it is important to note that CN was also a respondent in another hearing held in Jasper in which another complainant, Denise Seeley, raised issues very similar to those of the Whyte and Richards' cases. The Seeley matter was heard from August 10 to 14, 2009 and final arguments were heard on September 21, 2009, the day preceding the beginning of the Whyte and Richards hearing.\n[4] The evidence of the Whyte and Richards' hearing will be dealt with in detail in the decision on the merits. However, to understand the issues of this motion, the Tribunal deems it important to give a summary of some of the evidence presented at the hearing. Ms. Whyte, Ms. Richards and Ms. Seeley were conductors working for CN. In the mid-nineties they were laid-off for lack of work. In February 2005, they, along with 45 other laid-off employees, were recalled to cover a shortage in Vancouver. Alleging issues with their respective families, they did not report to Vancouver. On the basis of their failure to report CN terminated their employment. Ms. Richards, Ms. Whyte and Ms. Seeley filed complaints under the CHRA. CN defended its decision by alleging, first, that these employees situation were not protected under the CHRA and, secondly, that if the situations did fall under the CHRA, CN had accommodated them by giving them more time to report to Vancouver in order to sort out their affairs. CN also argued that granting the relief sought by these employees would cause undue hardship in that it would grant them the equivalent of super seniority solely on the basis of their status as parents.\n[5] At the Seeley hearing, CN was represented by the same counsel who represented it in the Whyte and Richards case and the lawyer for the Commission was also the same. Ms. Seeley was represented by a different counsel than Ms. Whyte and Richards. Neither Ms. Whyte or Ms. Richards, nor their counsel attended the Seeley hearing, although there was no order or direction from the Tribunal precluding them from attending. In essence, with minor distinction, the same evidence was adduced in both hearings and, except for one witness, CN called the same witnesses in both matters.\nB. The CATS (Crew Assignment and Timekeeping System) Records [6] In order to understand the substance of the motion, it is important that we deal, with some details, with the history of the disclosure of the records which are in question in this procedure, with reference, where appropriate, to the transcription of the evidence and to the record of the hearing.\n[7] CN's motion refers to information contained on Excel spreadsheets which were first produced in the Seeley hearing and subsequently in the Richards and Whyte hearing. This information is described by CN as the original data.\n[8] According to the undisputed evidence submitted by the Commission, these documents first came to light as information disclosed by CN one week before the start of the Seeley hearing. They were sent on August 3, 2009, by CN's counsel, to the Tribunal, with copies to Mr. Renouf, counsel for Ms. Seeley and to the Commission. In the letter accompanying the documents, CN's counsel wrote:\nFurther to the upcoming hearing in the above-mentioned matter [the Seeley matter] and the letter of July 28th, 2009, from the Complainant's attorney [Mr. Renouf], CN intends to refer to the following additional documents before the Tribunal:\nCN's employment equity policy and employment equity narrative reports, for the years 1996-2008, said reports being publicly available documents published on the website of Human Resources and Social Development Canada, and Excerpts from CN's SAPS personnel management system detailing the status of employees referred to as AB, HI, P, U and Y in CN's Amended Statement of Particulars during the year 2005. (Emphasis added.)\n[9] The letter also explained the purpose of this disclosure :\nNone of these documents add any supplemental facets to the debate and are solely designed to facilitate the presentation of already announced facts and testimony regarding, respectively, the employment status of women at CN and the fact set out in paragraph 40c) of CN's Amended Statement of Particulars. (Emphasis added)\n[10] Paragraph 40c) of CN's Amended Statement of Particulars in the Seeley matter refers to five (5) employees who were relieved from their obligation to report to Vancouver, but remained in the employ of CN. This same paragraph also appears in CN's Amended Statement of Particulars in the Whyte and Richards matters.\n[11] On August 5, 2009, counsel for the Commission wrote to CN's counsel requesting that CN produce the same information for all the remaining employees recalled to Vancouver. These documents were disclosed to the Commission and to Mr. Renouf on August 7, 2009. The records of the remaining 42 employees were included in an Excel spreadsheet and contained numerous pages of information concerning the status of these employees during the particular period relevant to these proceedings.\n[12] On September 11, 2009, Commission's counsel sent an e-mail to CN's counsel inquiring whether the document produced on August 7, 2009, would also be disclosed in the Whyte and Richards cases. These documents were in due course disclosed to counsel for Ms. Whyte and Ms. Richards.\n[13] As stated earlier, the Whyte and Richards hearing started on September 22, 2009, the day following the closing arguments in the Seeley matter. The hearing continued for almost 15 days, on various dates throughout the fall. According to the Respondent List of Exhibits, CN put into evidence the CATS records for five employees. (See Exhibit R-1, Tab 27 through Tab 31 inclusively) and two other CATS records (See Exhibits R-10 and R-11). These documents were put into evidence through Ms. Elaine Storms, CN's Senior Manager of the Crew Management Centre for Western Operations in Edmonton, a key witness for CN.\n[14] For its part the Commission put into evidence the CATS records for fifteen (15) other employees. (See Exhibits HR-1, Tab 5 through and including Tab 10 and HR-2, Tab 23 through and including Tab 30). These documents were also put into evidence through Ms. Storms.\n[15] The remainder of the CATS records were put into evidence by the complainants' counsel (See Exhibit C-33), but not in the format in which they had been disclosed by CN. Ms. Chahley, the complainants' counsel, during her cross-examination of Ms. Storms on October 26, 2009, explained that she had created a new format by re-sorting the information contained in the original Excel spreadsheets provided by CN. This new document was re-sorted in such way that it showed which employees recalled to Vancouver were available on any given date in the year 2005.\n[16] Mr. Paquette, CN's counsel, raised an objection regarding the production of this document in the format produced by Ms. Chahley. The transcription on this point reads as follows:\nMR. PAQUETTE: I have to object to the way this document is being presented to the witness. As Ms. Chahley mentioned, there is a lot of information that was deleted from it, and I'm concerned that it's essentially being presented as, excuse the term, cherry picking the entries where only available is mentioned. The witness doesn't have any context to draw on to provide a complete answer.\n[17] The Tribunal dealt with this objection in the following manner:\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: [...] I will let Ms. Chahley proceed with this document. [...] If you have any problems with the information that's on this document here, certainly in your reply you will be able to bring any additional information that you believe is necessary to complete the document, and I will allow you to do that at that point. Or if the witness comes to a point where she says I'm sorry, I can't follow the information in the way that it's presented here, we will go back to the full document. [...] The witness can certainly if she wants to refer to the full document, do so. Or if she believes that she's not able to answer the questions, she will certainly [say so]. Or if you want to complete the document, if you believe that it's incomplete and that the information is not all there you will be able to do that with your reply.\n[18] No further objection was raised by CN's counsel during the cross-examination of his witness on the document prepared by Ms. Chahley. During reexamination of his witness, Mr. Paquette did not question her on this document, nor did he bring forward or allude to any information that could have been used to complete or explain the document.\n[19] Ms. Storms' cross-examination shows that she was questioned thoroughly by the complainants' and by the Commission's counsels on the CATS records. Taking into consideration the issue raised by CN in its motion, the following excerpts of the transcript of her evidence are worth mentioning:\nMS. CHAHLEY: Okay. So, on these CATS sheets, I think you said this last day that when an employee shows as available, that means that they're signed up on the board, but they're not working that day; is that correct?\nMS. STORMS: It means that they're on the board, but not working that day, yes.\nMS. CHAHLEY: And that they would be available for that two-hour call; correct?\nMS. STORMS: Actually, in this document they could actually be on rest or -- this document doesn't have some of the detail that a work history would. So, I would actually have to compare a work history to check, but generally speaking, available does mean that the employee is available for a call.\n[...]\nMS. CHAHLEY: So, we know that that employee was available to work at least one of those two days, and maybe two of those days; correct?\nMS. STORMS: Again, it's very difficult to tell without the full work record.\nMS. CHAHLEY: Well, Ms. Storms, CN didn't give me the full work record. This is all --\nMS. STORMS: I understand that.\nMS. CHAHLEY: -- I have to work with. [...] And I assumed that CN was giving me the document that gave me the information. So, let's work with the best we've got here. Are you saying that it's impossible to make any statements without the full work record?\nMS. STORMS: Well, because this type of document is usually a snapshot at a specific time, I am saying it would be difficult to tell you that, yes.\nMS. CHAHLEY: So, we can't take from this that any of these employees are available on any of these days?\nMS. STORMS: Not -- it's very difficult to tell. So, if they took the snapshot at four o'clock in the morning and the employee showed available, but they worked at eight o'clock, then I wouldn't see that here.\nMS. CHAHLEY: Well, wouldn't it say working, if they worked during the day?\nMS. STORMS: I'm sorry, yes, you're correct.\n[...]\nMS. CHAHLEY: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but what I see is that the employee, when they're working, they get a B number instead of an A.\nMS. STORMS: Yes, that's correct.\nMS. CHAHLEY: And types in working?\nMS. STORMS: That's right. If they worked in that time frame, that's correct.\nMS. CHAHLEY: And because it's by day, I assumed and correct me if I'm wrong, that meant somewhere in that 24-hour period they were working?\nMS. STORMS: Yes.\n[...]\nMS. CHAHLEY: [...] If the person works in the 24 hour period, the system, as it seems to be configured, would show them as working -\nMS. STORMS: That's correct.\nMS. CHAHLEY: So, when it shows them available -\nMS. STORMS: They're either on rest or available. I can't think of another status that they would be in.\n[...]\nMS. CHAHLEY: My question was: Can you explain what's going on? I have suggested to you that even with the best of intentions there were times when people weren't deployed very effectively, and that managers worked even though conductors were available, and you said: Well, that couldn't happen. And I'm suggesting to you that it did happen.\nMS. STORMS: And I'm not saying it couldn't happen; I just said it would be unusual for it to happen and it could have happened, but it would just be unusual. That's all I'm saying.\nMS. CHAHLEY: Do you have any explanation of why Mr. Employee M was still available and not working?\nMS. STORMS: No, I don't.\n[Emphasis added.]\n(Extracts from Elaine Storms testimony, October 26th, 2009).\n[20] On the morning of November 12th, 2009, the day on which the parties' final arguments were scheduled to start, two preliminary issues were raised. The first one, raised by Mr. Paquette, was a request for an adjournment so that the parties could discuss the possibility of a settlement. The Tribunal refused this request, indicating that the hearing had already gone on well beyond the time which had been originally set aside. The Tribunal indicated that the parties could, if they so desired, pursue the avenue of a settlement, but the Tribunal did not believe that it would be in their best interest to grant an adjournment at this late date.\n[21] The other issue was raised by Ms. Chahley.\nMS. CHAHLEY: Mr. Chairman, I'm put in a very bad position here. I need to discuss an issue with you. My friend had indicated, Mr. Paquette had a second matter that he raised just a few minutes ago regarding a potential issue with the accuracy of certain CN documents. I can't, as an officer of the court, proceed without that at least being addressed as we start this hearing today. I think that it's important that the Tribunal is aware of where we stand moving forward, even in terms of further cross-examination of this very witness, and it's inappropriate to leave it hanging at this stage.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: What is this matter?\nMR. PAQUETTE: Mr. Chairperson, it concerns the CATS records that have been used in this hearing. Late last night or early this morning depending how you look at it, I was informed that the CATS records may be inaccurate with regards to the question of available versus working.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Well, I would certainly need to hear - CN is a very sophisticated business entity and this in a certain way is coming to a point where I'm just in a position that I can't really understand what's going on. Documents were submitted into evidence by the person responsible for the CATS system, members of CN were cross-examined for a week and a half on those documents and you're telling me that you only heard last night that these documents might be inaccurate?\nMR. PAQUETTE: Yes, sir.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Does that - the new information that's coming up -\nMS. CHAHLEY: We don't even know what it is yet, Mr. Chairman, but I'd also point out those documents were filed and dealt with in the Seeley matter as well.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Yes, I know.\nMS. CHAHLEY: I mean, we're flabbergasted and...\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: So am I.\nMS. CHAHLEY: But I couldn't not deal with it. We can't finish today and then have suddenly new - this has to get dealt with.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Well, it's on record and the Complainants will deal with those documents as they were submitted and the information that was presented will be the information that is. I cannot accept at this late point that counsel would tell me that he was only informed of this late last night. I don't put in doubt that you were, but you had witnesses that are really knowledgeable on the working of the CATS system.\nMR. PAQUETTE: It's not a question in the CAT system itself but more the manner in which the reports were generated.\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Well, that's something that should have been looked at when the evidence was generated. Unfortunately the evidence was put in after about three weeks of hearing in the manner that it was put in and we will have to live with that and I will deal with that certainly in my decision at one point.\nMR. PAQUETTE: I understand and -\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: And, again, again this information will have also to be submitted to MR. Renouf in the Seeley matter.\nMR. PAQUETTE: If I may, Mr. Chairperson, at this point there really is no information to speak of. What I understand is that the manner it was -\nTHE CHAIRPERSON: Well, the information that you just rendered that there might be - and I want that because I will deal with that in the record also in the Seeley matter, this information has to be forwarded - well, what you've informed both counsel this morning, the Commission and Ms. Chahley. I make a ruling that I'm telling you to send a letter to Mr. Renouf sharing with him that same information with a copy to the Tribunal.\n(Emphasis added.)\n[22] As the transcript clearly shows, there was no motion presented that morning by Mr. Paquette regarding this new information, nor was there any explanation as to what this information was and who had given that information. What's more, the transcription of the exchange on that morning plainly and unequivocally contradicts Mr. Paquette's recollection as it appears in CN's motion at paragraph 9. In that paragraph, after explaining that he had brought this information to the attention of the complainants' and Commission's counsels, Mr. Paquette states: CN's counsel also explained the discrepancy to Michel Doucet, the Tribunal Member hearing the matter. CN's counsel explained that based on the indications provided by Ms. Rusnak the night before, the original data could be misleading with regards to circumstances where employees would be classified as being available for work. (Emphasis added.)\n[23] It is clear from the extracts of the transcription reproduced above, that Mr. Paquette's recollection is not totally accurate. He never gave an explanation to the Tribunal regarding what he describes as a discrepancy in the evidence. At the most, he stated that late last night or early this morning he had been informed that the CATS records may be inaccurate with regards to the question of available versus working with no other explanation or detail. He even added that at this point there really is no information to speak of. He certainly never mentioned that this information had been provided by Ms. Rusnak, a name the Tribunal heard for the first time in Ms. Storms' affidavit, nor, for that matter, that this information had been provided to him by Ms. Storms.\n[24] In her affidavit, Ms. Storms gives a more detailed explanation of what happened during the evening of November 11th. 2009. She explains that she did not create the Excel spreadsheets for which she was examined and cross-examined at length. She further states that the first time she saw this document was in preparation for her testimony in the Seeley hearing. According to her affidavit, the Excel spreadsheets were created from CN's CATS program by an employee in CN'S Resource Management group, but she does not indicate who this employee was. She adds: However, because I did not prepare the original data and I have seen similar reports in the past, I assumed at the time of my testimony in both the Seeley hearing and the Richards and Whyte hearing that [the Excel spreadsheet] was a complete document with respect to the 47 employees' work histories. (Emphasis added.)\n[25] In paragraph 7 of her affidavit she further declares:\nOn the evening of November 11, 2009, during the Richards and Whyte hearing, I requested that Michelle Rusnak, a Crew Supervisor in the Crew Management Centre, review the work histories of each of the 47 employees. In particular, I wanted to review the whereabouts of the 47 employees on the days in which the original data showed them to be unavailable for work (due to days in, vacation, illness, leaves of absences, etc.) in order to assist Mr. Paquette with perhaps explaining why those employees had worked less shifts than expected. While doing so, Ms. Rusnak advised me that the original data appeared to be incomplete.\n[26] Ms. Storms said that she immediately disclosed this discrepancy to Mr. Paquette in the early morning hours of November 12, 2009. Then she declares that on the morning of November 12, 2009, Mr. Paquette brought this information to the attention of Ms. Chahley and to Ms. Osborne-Brown, counsel for the Commission. She also adds that Mr. Paquette also brought this discrepancy to the attention of Mr. Michel Doucet, the Tribunal member hearing the matter. Unfortunately, the transcript of the hearing does not support this conclusion. It was not Mr. Paquette who raised the matter with the Tribunal but Ms. Chahley and when Mr. Paquette did address the issue, he did not explain what this discrepancy was but only indicated that the information on the Excel spreadsheets was incomplete without giving any details. He even added at this point there really is no information to speak of.\n[27] Finally, Ms. Storms explains that following the conclusion of the Richards and Whyte hearing, she requested that the work histories of the 47 employees be reviewed for accuracy by CN's Ressource Management group. According to her affidavit, the complete work history of the 47 employees was subsequently extracted from various computer systems and a new Excel document was created showing the most accurate record available, for the year 2005, in which terminal each of the 47 employees worked and how many shifts each of the 47 employees worked.\nIII. Question in issue [28] The only question in issue in this motion is whether the Tribunal should grant the motion sought by CN and allow it to reopen its case to adduce new evidence which it alleges was not available at the time of the hearing.\n[29] The Commission did raise another issue. It argued that the Tribunal was functus officio because it had already ruled on the issue regarding alleged incompleteness of the CATS documents. A careful review of the transcript of November 12, 2009, clearly shows that this is not a correct description of what occurred on that morning. On November 12, no motion was presented to the Tribunal asking that it deal with the issue of the incompleteness of the CATS documents. Consequently, no ruling could have been made on this issue. The only ruling rendered that morning was the one instructing Mr. Paquette to inform Mr. Renouf, counsel for Ms. Seeley, of the new development regarding the CATS documents.\nIV. The Law [30] The only case submitted by the parties to address the issue at hand is the Tribunal's decision in Vermette v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation [1994] C.H.R.D. N\u00b0 14 (approved in [1996] F.C.J. No. 1274). In that decision, the Tribunal applied the test set out in Gass v. Childs (1958), 43 M.P.R. 87, to justify the reception of fresh evidence:\nIn Gass v. Childs (1958), 43 M.P.R. 87 at page 93, Ritchie J.A. set forth three criteria that should be satisfied before tribunal exercises its discretion to reopen:\nIn order to justify either the reception of fresh evidence or the ordering of a new trial the three conditions set out hereunder must be fulfilled:\n1. It must be shown the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;\n2. The evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and\n3. The evidence must be such as presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.\n[31] The Tribunal in Vermette also referred to other decisions dealing with an application to reopen a case. It noted:\nWhere an application to re-open is received after a decision has been rendered, the principles that should guide the exercise of this discretion are described by Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases in the following manner at page 542:\nExcept in the case of fraud or surprise, the evidence must be newly discovered evidence which reasonable diligence could not have discovered during the trial, and it must be of such a character that it would have formed a determining factor in the result.\nWhere the application to reopen is received prior to a decision being rendered, a broader discretion to reopen has been recognized. Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases at page 541 suggest that a case may be reopened where the interest of justice requires it. Among the cases cited by Sopinka and Lederman is Sunny Isle Farms Ltd. v. Mayhew (1972), 27 D.L.R. (3d) 323 (P.E.I.S.C.). In that case Nicholson J. adopted the statement by Boyle J. in Sales v. Calgary Stock Exchange, [1931] 3 W.W.R. 392 at 394 (Alta. S.C.) where he said:\nIt is in my view a serious matter to open up a trial after all the evidence has been taken, and it should never be done unless it seems imperative in the interest of justice that the case should be reopened for further evidence.\n[32] In its motion, CN submits that the order sought should be granted because the situation it is raising meets the criteria set out in the Vermette decision. For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal finds that CN has not met these criteria and CN's motion is therefore denied. The Tribunal will now deal with each criterion in turn, although the failure to meet one of these would be sufficient on its own to refuse the order sought.\n(i) Could the evidence have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the hearings before or during the hearing? [33] The answer to this part of the test is yes. It is clear from CN's motion and the supporting affidavit of Ms. Storms, as well as from the record of the hearing, that the information that CN now wishes to submit to the Tribunal was available to CN before and during both hearings.\n[34] Considering first the affidavit of Ms. Storms: it is clear that had CN been diligent during the Seeley hearing or right after that hearing, and even after Ms. Storms' evidence in the Whyte and Richards hearing, it could have easily obtained this information. In this regards, Ms. Storms states in paragraph 7 of her affidavit:\nDuring my testimony in the Richards and Whyte hearing, counsel for the Complainants noted that the original data appeared to indicate that several of the 47 employees did not actually perform work on several days in a row in the year 2005 but were indicated as being available to work (within CN' this means the employee is available for a call but is not currently performing work). This was surprising to me because I was in Vancouver managing the shortage in late 2005 and it was a very busy terminal at the time. Moreover, the reason CN required the employees to report to Vancouver was due to one of the most serious employee shortages CN had ever experienced In my view the original data should have shown those employees to have been working more shifts. However, I had often worked with documents very similar to the one produced and I believed the report to be complete. (Emphasis added.)\n[35] This paragraph is perplexing for many reasons. First of all, Ms. Storms' assertion that she was surprised that the original data appeared to indicate that several of the employees did not actually perform work on several days when at the Vancouver shortage is not apparent when we consider her evidence at the hearing. For example, during her cross-examination by Ms. Chahley on October 26, 2009, the question was put directly to her whether she could explain why employees would be available in Vancouver and not working. Her answer was: And I'm not saying it couldn't happen; I just said it would be unusual for it to happen and it could have happened, but it would just be unusual. That's all I'm saying. Then Ms. Chahley asked: Do you have any explanation of why Mr. Employee M was still available and not working? and the answer was No, I don't. There was no indication at that point that she was surprised by this information and that she would try to find an explanation. There was no indication either that she doubted the validity of the information. On the contrary, she did not reject the possibility that it was accurate, but simply added that it was unusual, although it could have happened.\n[36] The other problem I have with paragraph 7 of Ms. Storms' affidavit is the last sentence which reads: However, I had often worked with documents very similar to the one produced and I believed the report to be complete. If I understand that sentence correctly, Ms. Storms is telling us that she considered the documents to be complete and trustworthy because she had often worked with documents very similar. Her evidence at the hearing and the way she answered the questions put to her in her examination and on cross-examination corroborates this conclusion. When she was testifying, she had no doubts about the accuracy of the documents. If Ms. Storms had doubted its correctness, she would certainly have made the necessary verifications and raised the question immediately with CN's counsel and not have waited until November 11, fourteen days after her testimony in the Richards and Whyte hearing was finished and over a month and half after her testimony in the Seeley matter, to raise these concerns. She gives no explanation in her affidavit as to why she did not verify or ask questions before the evening of November 11, 2009 and why she was prompted to do it on November 11.\n[37] Also, it seems from her affidavit that reviewing these work histories did not require much time. In paragraph 8, she states that on the evening of November 11, 2009 she requested that Michelle Rusnak, a crew supervisor, review the work histories of the 47 employees. It did not take Ms. Rusnak long to find these inaccuracies, because on that same evening she advised Ms. Storms that the original data for several of the 47 employees was incomplete. Later that evening or early the next morning Ms. Storms advised Mr. Paquette.\n[38] In regards to whether CN knew that there was more information in CATS that it had decided to put in evidences, again Ms. Storms' answers in cross-examination are revealing. In one part of her cross-examination, which is set out above, she herself raises the possibility that not all the information was in the original Excel Spreadsheet. Following are excerpts of the transcription:\nMS. CHAHLEY: So, we know that that employee was available to work at least one of those two days, and maybe two of those days; correct?\nMS. STORMS: Again, it's very difficult to tell without the full work record.\nMS. CHAHLEY: Well, Ms. Storms, CN didn't give me the full work record. This is all --\nMS. STORMS: I understand that.\nMS. CHAHLEY: -- I have to work with. [...] And I assumed that CN was giving me the document that gave me the information.\n[39] Furthermore, Ms. Storms also indicates in her cross-examination that this information was a snap shot of data compiled by the computer program at approximately 4:00 a.m. Again, it is important to repeat the exchange between Ms. Storms and Ms. Chahley on this point.\nMS. STORMS: Well, because this type of document is usually a snapshot at a specific time, I am saying it would be difficult to tell you that, yes.\nMS. CHAHLEY: So, we can't take from this that any of these employees are available on any of these days?\nMS. STORMS: Not -- it's very difficult to tell. So, if they took the snapshot at four o'clock in the morning and the employee showed available, but they worked at eight o'clock, then I wouldn't see that here.\nMS. CHAHLEY: Well, wouldn't it say working, if they worked during the day?\nMS. STORMS: I'm sorry, yes, you're correct.\n[40] This exchange clearly contradicts the assertion made by CN in paragraph 6 of its motion where it states: However, unknown to CN at the time of the hearings, the original data was compiled by the computer program which takes a snap shot of an employee's work day as of approximately 4:00 a.m. (Emphasis added.) If CN had no knowledge of this, its key witness on this matter certainly knew.\n[41] Ms. Storms has significant experience as the Director of the Crew Management Center and she showed throughout her testimony her knowledge of the working of CN as it pertains to crewing. She had a very good understanding of CATS and the records that could be generated from the system. CN did not choose this witness at random but because of her familiarity and knowledge with the crew management.\n[42] If CN had put its mind to it, it would have been able to obtain this evidence for use at the hearing. The affidavit of Ms. Storms clearly suggests that CN had this information in its possession. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that Ms. Rusnak, who, according to Ms. Storms' affidavit did a review of the employees' work histories on the evening of November 11th 2009, did not seem to have any problem gathering the information. Waiting until the night before the closing argument to look into possible explanations does not in the Tribunal's opinion show the reasonable diligence necessary to meet the first criteria of the Vermette test. The Tribunal therefore concludes that CN has not met the first criterion.\n[43] This conclusion would be sufficient to dispose of the motion, but since the parties have presented extensive arguments regarding the other two criteria, the Tribunal will address them.\n(ii) Would the evidence have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive? [44] In its motion CN states that without the new evidence [...] the Tribunal could make the inference that the recall was never a necessity and therefore the Complainants' terminations of employment would never have occurred or were unrelated to the refusal to report to cover the employee shortage. This allegation is speculative at best. It would be quite surprising if the Tribunal was to make an inference that the recall process for the Vancouver shortage was not necessary.\n[45] The other reason put forward by CN as to why the nature of the updated data might have a determining effect is that the Tribunal could make erroneous conclusions with respect to CN's ability to accommodate the Complainants in 2005 to the point of undue hardship. CN's motion provides no reasons to explain how this updated data could affect its undue hardship argument.\n[46] CN has not demonstrated in its motion how the content of the new spreadsheet would have an important influence on the result of the case.\n(iii) Is the evidence apparently credible? [47] CN is seeking an order granting permission to reopen its case in order to present what it alleges is more accurate evidence in regards to a document which it prepared, formed part of its evidence and which covers information over which it had complete control.\n[48] CN has the burden of establishing the necessary facts which would assist the Tribunal in determining if this evidence is apparently credible. In her affidavit, Ms. Storms summarily explains how this new information was gathered. She states that following the Richards and Whyte hearing, she requested that the work histories of the 47 employees be reviewed for accuracy by CN's Resource Management group. She gives no indication of what the Resource Management group is and who, besides Ms. Rusnak, in this group was in charge of doing this review. Concerning the methodology used to do this work, the only information in her affidavit is that the complete history was extracted from various computer systems with no further detail.\n[49] This very limited information does not give the Tribunal the factual background necessary to establish whether or not the new evidence is apparently credible. CN reproduces this new evidence in Ms. Storms' affidavit, but at this point, it is not for the Tribunal to determine whether this information is credible or not, taking into consideration that the Tribunal has not had the benefit to hear the evidence of those who prepared the document, nor of their cross-examination. At this preliminary stage it is for CN to put forward sufficient evidence to assist the Tribunal in appreciating whether or not this information is apparently credible, which it has not done.\n[50] Even if the Tribunal was to give the benefit of the doubt to CN on this criterion, it still would not order the reopening of the case, because CN has not met the other two criteria of Vermette.\nV. Conclusion [51] In its arguments, CN states that allowing the opening of the case would present no prejudice to the other parties and that the whole issue raised in the motion is basically a question of fairness for CN. CN should understand that fairness is equitable and that it cuts both ways. The Complainants and the Commission deserve to be treated and judged fairly as much as does CN. CN had control over this information. CN had two opportunities to examine Ms. Storms and its other witnesses on these documents. CN's witnesses were thoroughly cross-examined on them. CN had ample opportunity to correct this information if it was inaccurate; it did not do so before the last day of the hearing when Counsel raised the issue that some of the information might be inaccurate but without going into any details. CN cannot now say that by refusing its motion it would be treated unfairly\n[52] After a careful review of the material and argument submitted by the parties, the Tribunal is of the opinion that CN has not met the criteria set out in the case law for the reopening of a hearing in order to present new evidence. In particular, it has not shown that it used reasonable diligence to obtain the evidence so that it could be used at the hearings.\n[53] For these reason, CN's motion is dismissed.\nOriginal signed by\nMichel Doucet\nOTTAWA, Ontario March 23, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1354\/8408 & T1356\/8608\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nKasha A.

Chotalia\n[1] The Tribunal has considered the motion by the Mushkegowuk Council (proposed interested party) for interested party status in this proceeding, as well as the submissions made in response, and the proposed interested party's reply, and has considered the legal authorities cited by the parties.\nDiscretionary Remedy [2] Section 50 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) allows the Tribunal, on a discretionary basis, to grant interested party status at the inquiry to governments, organizations and persons.\n[3] Section 48.9(1) of the CHRA requires that proceedings before the Tribunal be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow.\n[4] Rule 8 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure allows for the bringing of motions for interested party status.\nHow Does Expertise Assist the Tribunal? [5] The proposed interested party's asserted interest in the proceeding appears to stem principally from a separate ongoing CHRA proceeding in which it is involved, arising from different facts-namely, the funding and delivery of policing (the policing complaint).\n[6] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) decided to deal with the policing complaint and that decision is currently the subject of a judicial review application initiated by the Respondent.\n[7] The present proceeding, involving child and family services, currently involves 6 participants, including the CHRC, two complainant organizations, and two interested parties. As well, the proposed motion for interested party status was filed significantly later than the motions by the current interested parties.\n[8] The position of the proposed interested party on the services and comparator issues is already well represented by the two complainant organizations. The filing of the policing complaint does not equate to expertise that will be of assistance to the Tribunal beyond the expertise currently being provided to the Tribunal by the parties and the existing interested parties. Based on the materials filed the Tribunal is not satisfied that the proposed intervention will add significantly to the position of the current parties. Its position will be adequately addressed by the parties to the case.\nPotential for Prolonging the Proceedings [9] The present proceeding requires the Tribunal to assimilate vast quantities of factual material, even for the purposes of determining the Respondent's juridisdictional motion.\n[10] The proposed interested party's participation would broaden the scope of the facts under consideration in the present proceeding.\n[11] The making of written submissions by the proposed interested party without personal appearance raises its own set of logistical challenges and associated delays: e.g. the Tribunal would be unable to question counsel and would have to seek written responses and then provide concommitant time for the parties and current interested parties to respond; all of which will necessarily further prolong the proceedings and a decision in the matter.\n[12] The present proceeding already poses significant and exceptional case management challenges for the parties and the Tribunal; granting status to an additional interested party could not but increase these challenges.\n[13] Further, any alleged benefit is outweighed by the reasonably anticipated delay in the preliminary hearings and any substantive hearing.\n[14] The Tribunal, in view of the above, denies the motion for interested party status.\nSigned by\nShirish P.

INTRODUCTION [1] In December 2008, the Canadian Human Rights Commission referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal complaint #20060812 filed by Ramanan Thambiah against the Maritime Employers Association (the MEA) on January 2, 2007.\n[2] In this complaint, the Complainant says that he was a victim of discrimination based on his ethnicity, age and family status.\n[3] These three grounds of discrimination set out in section 2 of the Canadian Human Rights Act are prohibited under section 7 of that same Act.\n[4] In January 2006, at the time the events at issue occurred, the Complainant had been working as a longshoreman in the Port of Montreal for seven years; he had accumulated 10,000 hours of work.\n[5] In October 2005, he became eligible for a position in the first reserve, which could eventually lead to job security.\n[6] In December 2005, he passed the OLIFT test, which qualified him to operate a lift truck, the first of two tests giving access to the first reserve.\n[7] The second test is known as OTUGM and qualifies a candidate to drive a truck.\n[8] He failed the first truck test on January 25, 2006, and alleges that the evaluator held a camera and thus interfered with his movements and also made him change direction at the last minute, which caused the incident for which he was penalized. He accuses the evaluator of acting in this way for the sole purpose of sabotaging his test.\n[9] Several times he admits that he hit a container with his truck during the first test, and several times he denies that he hit the container; in the latter case, he accuses the trainer of striking the back of his truck with a hammer or a walkie-talkie to make a noise and then be able to accuse him of hitting the container. He admits that he did not see the trainer do that, but that is what he inferred.\n[10] He failed the second truck driving test on January 26, 2006, and claims that the sunlight reflected in the truck's mirrors prevented him from performing certain manoeuvres successfully and that the trailer's brakes were faulty.\n[11] He complains that, despite his repeated requests, the MEA evaluator refused to give him permission to take a third test, on the ground that company policy limits the number of tests to two and that he could not go against that policy.\n[12] The Complainant alleges that he was completely unaware of the policy barring a third test and that he was misled into thinking that the test could be repeated an unlimited number of times. He complains that the policy was established for the sole purpose of failing him.\n[13] He alleges that it is common knowledge among longshore workers in the Port of Montreal that many candidates were able to obtain positions as longshore workers because of their family ties to influential members of the MEA.\n[14] To substantiate that assertion, he reports the case of a candidate who, after failing the truck driving test twice, allegedly was given a third chance solely because he was the husband of an employee working in the offices of the MEA.\n[15] He alleges that given his lack of family ties to a member of the MEA, he was made to fail the two truck driving tests. He concludes that he received differential and discriminatory treatment.\n[16] He alleges that he is a member of a visible minority, that he is over fifty years old and that he has been the target of racist remarks.\n[17] He states that the financial consequences of the refusal to allow him to take a third test are dramatic for him. This means that he will never have job security as a longshoreman and will not receive the benefits, including monetary ones, that are given to longshore workers with job security.\n[18] As a remedy, the Complainant is seeking an amendment of the MEA's hiring and evaluation policies, cancellation of the results of his first two truck driving tests and monetary compensation.\n[19] Before considering the merits of the complaint, that is, the Respondent's possible violation of section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, the Tribunal will examine the preliminary matters that were raised at the beginning of the hearing.\nII. COMPLAINT [20] In his complaint, the Complainant submits that he was a victim of discrimination based on his ethnicity, age and family status; the last of these grounds took the form of nepotism, in that the MEA allegedly rejected his candidacy in favour of candidates connected by family ties with members of the MEA's management.\n[21] In her opening statement, Deborah Mankovitz, counsel for the Complainant, stated that she intended to demonstrate each of the three grounds of discrimination alleged in her client's complaint.\n[22] However, after the examination of the witnesses and before beginning her argument, after reflection and consultation with her client, Ms. Mankovitz informed the Tribunal that she had decided to drop those elements of the complaint concerning ethnicity and age.\n[23] She stated that her argument would therefore pertain to a single ground of discrimination, that is, family status, which she characterized throughout the hearing as plain nepotism.\nIII. PRELIMINARY MATTERS [24] On January 6, 2010, five days before the start of the hearing scheduled for the week of January 11 to 15, 2009, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, representing the Longshore Workers' Union of the Port of Montreal, brought a written motion for the Tribunal to grant it interested party status. It justified its motion by claiming that it had only just learned of the hearing in the matter of Ramanan Thambiah v. MEA before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal.\n[25] At the beginning of the hearing, Edith Laperle, counsel for the Union, stated that, for the time being, her client wished only to attend the hearing as an interested party and receive copies of documents filed in evidence, without asking for the right to be heard, call witnesses or cross-examine the witnesses for the two parties.\n[26] However, she added that in the event that accusations were made against the Longshore Workers' Union, it would ask the Tribunal for leave to adduce evidence.\n[27] Deborah Mankovitz, counsel for the Complainant, and Daniel Leduc, counsel for the Respondent, consented to Ms. Laperle's motion.\n[28] The Canadian Human Rights Commission did not take part in the hearing.\n[29] The Chairperson of the Tribunal, in accordance with the authority conferred on him under section 50 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, and satisfied with the explanation given by Ms. Laperle for her belated motion to intervene and the reasons supporting it, therefore recognized the Union as an interested party entitled to attend the hearing. He also reserved the right to make any further ruling concerning the possibility of broadening that role, at the Union's request, according to circumstances.\n[30] The Chairperson of the Tribunal granted the motion to exclude witnesses brought jointly by counsel for both parties.\nIV. ROLE OF THE MEA, MEA WORKFORCE & ACCESS TO THE 2nd & 1st RESERVE [31] In order to understand the nature of the claim made by the Complainant, a longshoreman at the Port of Montreal, and the context of his employment, it is essential to understand (a) the purpose of the MEA, (b) the workforce used by the MEA in the Port of Montreal and (c) access to the second and first reserve.\n[32] At paragraphs 1.1 to 1.22 of his Statement of Particulars, filed prior to the hearing, counsel for the Respondent explains the three above-mentioned elements in detail.\n[33] Since the two parties agreed at the beginning of the hearing on the accuracy of paragraphs 1.1 to 1.22, they are worth reading and are therefore reproduced verbatim below:\n[translation]\nA- RELEVANT FACTS\n1. THE MARITIME EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION\n(a) Purpose of the Maritime Employers Association\n1.1 The Maritime Employers Association (MEA) is an association comprising all longshoring companies in the different ports of Eastern Canada, including the Port of Montreal.\n1.2 Every day, the MEA receives from each longshoring company in the Port of Montreal a workforce order for the following day, which specifies the classification required according to the work to be performed by the company.\n1.3 The MEA's principal mission is therefore to recruit, train and deploy workers for the different longshoring companies operating in the Port of Montreal.\n(b) Workforce\n1.4 To meet the needs of those companies, the MEA maintains a pool of qualified workers.\n1.5 There are three general categories of workers employed by the MEA: employees with job security (approximately 880); employees in the first reserve (approximately 90); and employees in the second reserve (approximately 30).\n1.6 A new employee who joins the second reserve will, provided he or she obtains certain classifications, move up to the first reserve in the relatively long term and, finally, to the group with job security.\n1.7 All MEA employees, regardless of category, perform a single function, that of longshore worker, which is divided into different classifications.\n1.8 The list of almost all longshoring classifications is found on pages 66 & 69 of the collective agreement between the Maritime Employers Association and the Longshore Workers Union, Local 375, which expires on December 31, 2008 (collective agreement).\n1.9 Some of the above-mentioned classifications are mandatory for employees joining the second reserve and the first reserve, specifically:\nMandatory classifications:\n2nd reserve\nPCALE:\nEPAND:\nELING:\nOLASH:\nSCHRP:\ncargo officer;\nspreader;\nslinger;\nlasher;\nseine carpenter;\n1st reserve\nsame classifications as for the 2nd reserve, plus the following:\nOLIFT:\nlift truck operator - 13 tons and under;\nPLIFT:\nlift truck operator - 13 tons and under in the hold;\nOBLOC:\nlift truck operator - 13 tons and under and block officer;\nOTUGM:\ntruck operator.\n1.10 The obligation of employees in the first reserve to qualify as lift truck operators and truck operators is set out in clause 13.08 of the collective agreement.\n1.11 The truck operator classification is an absolute condition for advancing to the first reserve and is among the training programs provided by the MEA.\n1.12 In addition to the three general categories of employees mentioned in paragraph 1.5, the MEA uses the services of persons holding blank cards to meet occasional workforce needs.\n1.13 The blank card is a piece of identification that allows its holder to go to the MEA's hiring hall in hopes of obtaining longshoring work for a given day, in the event that there are too few longshore workers with job security and\/or in the first and second reserve to meet that day's longshoring needs.\n1.14 The procedure requires holders of blank cards (of which there are roughly 100) seeking work to go to the MEA's hiring hall at the beginning of a shift and offer their services by showing their cards, which simply allow the MEA to identify the person seeking work.\n(c) Moving up to the second and first reserve\n1.15 When a place in the second reserve becomes available, the MEA must refer to a List of Reserve Candidates.\n1.16 That List is drawn up by the Longshore Workers' Union, CUPE Local 375 (the Union), and the workers whose names appear on it may or may not hold blank cards.\n1.17 Thus, every time the MEA has one or more positions to fill in the second reserve, the Union sends the MEA a letter, signed by the eligible candidate, informing it of the candidate's interest in applying for a position in the second reserve.\n1.18 On receipt of the signed letter, the MEA begins the hiring process, which involves:\n1.18.1 aptitude tests for candidates;\n1.18.2 a pre-hiring medical examination to ensure that candidates meet the psychological, physical and medical requirements of longshoring work; and\n1.18.3 a criminal record check.\n1.19 These requirements are set out in clause 13.07 of the collective agreement.\n1.20 Entry into the first reserve occurs largely through attrition, that is, the voluntary departure, dismissal and retirement of employees with job security.\n1.21 The pool of workers considered for a position in the first reserve is made up of employees in the second reserve.\n1.22 To join the first reserve, as mentioned in paragraph 1.10, workers must be qualified to operate lift trucks and trucks.\nV. APPLICABLE LEGAL TESTS [34] A complainant must first convince the Tribunal that there is prima facie evidence of discrimination by the respondent. (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 202). In this case, since the Complainant has alleged discrimination based on family status, which can take the form of nepotism, he must satisfy the Tribunal that the evidence submitted regarding the allegations made is complete and sufficient, as the Supreme Court held in Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at paragraph 28:\nThe Complainant in proceedings before human rights tribunals must show a prima facie case of discrimination. A prima facie case in this context is one which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent-employer.\n[35] Accordingly, to reach its decision at this first stage, the Tribunal must limit its analysis strictly to the testimonial and documentary evidence adduced by the Complainant. It must disregard the evidence submitted by the Respondent in reply. See Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204, at paragraph 22:\n[22] The approach taken by the Tribunal and upheld by the Trial Judge in determining whether a prima facie case of discrimination had been made out is not supported by the authorities. The appellant's prima facie case was that he sought a position of chief engineer on board the M.V. Princess of Acadia, that he was qualified for the position, that someone else was hired for the position and that his race played a part in the Respondent's decision to hire the other candidates. By these allegations, the appellant might have established a prima facie of discrimination as explained in O'Malley, supra, that is, a case which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the Complainant's favour in the absence of an answer from the Respondent-employer. Instead of determining whether these allegations, if believed, justified a verdict in favour of the appellant, the Tribunal also took into account the Respondent's answer before concluding that a prima facie case had not been established. As is clear from Etobicoke, supra, and O'Malley, this latter element does not figure into a determination of whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been established.\n[36] If the Tribunal finds that there is no prima facie evidence of an essential element of the allegations or finds the evidence submitted incomplete or unsatisfactory, it must dismiss the complaint. See C.H.R.C. v. C.N. (2000) 38 C.H.R.R. D\/107 (F.C.). In fact, the question is really whether each essential aspect of the discriminatory act is substantiated by evidence.\n[37] To establish a prima facie case of discrimination, the Complainant must provide more than sweeping assertions. In this regard, see the Tribunal's decision in Singh v. Canada (Statistics Canada) (1998) C.H.R.D. No. 7, at paragraph 197.\n[38] To persuade the Tribunal, it is not sufficient for a person to claim discrimination and to be convinced of it without establishing a prima facie case. See Singh, supra, at paragraph 206.\n[39] However, if the Tribunal is of the opinion that a prima facie case has been made, the burden of proof then shifts to the Respondent, which must provide reasonable or satisfactory explanations for the otherwise discriminatory practice (See Lincoln v. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 FCA 204 (CanLII), at paragraph 23; Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 154 (CanLII), at paragraphs 26 and 27).\n[40] An employer's conduct will not be considered discriminatory if the employer can establish that any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference is based on a bona fide occupational requirement (BFOR) (paragraph 15(1)(a) of the Act). For a practice to be considered to be based on a BFOR, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs, considering health, safety and cost (subsection 15(2) of the Act).\n[41] The Respondent must also establish that the justification is not merely a pretext to cover up a discriminatory practice, as the Federal Court held in Canada (A.G.) v. Lambie, (1996) 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483.\n[42] The standard of proof to establish discrimination is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. That standard is less exacting than the standard applicable in criminal matters. Here is what the Tribunal wrote in Dawson v. Canada Post Corporation, 2008 CHRT 41, at paragraph 73:\n[73] This said, as stated in Wall v. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, (1997) C.H.R.D. 6, the standard of proof in discrimination cases remains the ordinary civil standard of the balance of probabilities and that in cases of circumstantial evidence, the test is the following: an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the evidence offered in support of it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (B.Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carswell, 1987, p. 142).\n[43] In fact, complainants are faced with a harsh reality. In the absence of direct evidence, they must rely on circumstantial evidence. See Basi v. Canadian National Railway, (1988) C.H.R.D. No. 2.\n[44] To succeed, the Complainant must also establish a causal connection between his failure to pass the two truck driving tests and the ground of discrimination alleged, that is, family status (nepotism). See Chopra v. Canada (A.G.), 2007 FCA 268.\nVI. COMPLAINANT'S CREDIBILITY [45] We note a great many contradictions in the Complainant's testimony and consider it useful to reproduce some of the more significant ones here.\n[46] At one point the Complainant admitted that he had failed the two truck driving tests, at another point he denied it, and finally he tried to justify his failure by advancing unverified and unverifiable hypotheses that changed over time.\n[47] Finding the consequences of his failure so disproportionate to the error held against him, he tried desperately to find a way out of this impasse.\n[48] He gave the impression of someone overwhelmed by the consequences of his failure, who was trying desperately to understand what could possibly have happened to him. During the hearing, he gave voice to his thoughts and advanced a number of hypotheses.\n[49] In his view, discrimination and sabotage by the trainer and the evaluator partly explained his two failed tests. Several outside factors also explained the failed tests. His testimony therefore went in all directions. His hypotheses were sometimes hard to imagine and even harder to verify.\n[50] Lastly, the Complainant advanced few substantive facts to support his position and mainly hid behind conjecture or hearsay.\n[51] By his testimony, the Complainant clearly showed that he had difficulty distinguishing between the facts of his case and hypotheses that might explain those facts.\n[52] In the final analysis, it is difficult to give much weight to the Complainant's version when compared with that of a witness testifying about facts of which he or she has personal knowledge.\n[53] In short, in our opinion, the Complainant's credibility is very low.\n[54] We will now analyze the different substantive questions that arose during the hearing.\nVII. SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS [55] It is important to establish what occurred on January 25 and 26, 2006, during the Complainant's two truck driving tests.\n[56] The only two witnesses to testify about these two tests were the Complainant and Mr. M., the evaluator, who is also the MEA's director of labour relations and workforce.\n[57] The Complainant explained what happened during the two tests and why he asked to take a third test, which was refused by the MEA's representative.\nA. Analysis of the 1st failed test (January 25, 2006) [58] In a letter dated December 15, 2006, to the vice-president of the MEA, filed as Exhibit R-1, Tab 7, the Complainant acknowledged that during his first attempt, on January 25, 2006, [translation] ... I hit a container. However, he blamed Mr. M., the evaluator, alleging that he put his hand on the front of the truck and asked him to change direction.\n[59] In the [translation] Brief Summary of Facts produced by counsel for the Complainant, the following is written at paragraph 6:\n[translation]\n6. His first attempt was unsuccessful. During the test, the evaluator held a camera which interfered with his movements.\n[60] In a letter dated October 19, 2007, to an employee of the CHRC, in reference to the incident of January 25, 2006, filed as Exhibit R1, Tab 11, page 2, he wrote again that there was an accrochage but no containers had moved only a claque sound.\n[61] However, during the hearing, he denied hitting the container but acknowledged that there was a noise. He could see only one explanation for the noise: Mr. L., the trainer, who was behind the truck, must have struck the back of the truck with a hammer or with his walkie-talkie. He also explained that he later saw Mr. L. put away his hammer.\n[62] He stated that Mr. L. told him: You hit [it].\n[63] During the hearing, the Complainant argued that if he had hit the container with his truck, the container would have moved because it was very easy to move since it was lying on ice, and that he could even have moved it by hand.\n[64] The witness, Mr. M., testified that a man could not have moved the container by hand because it weighed several thousand pounds, had been there for a very long time, its feet had to be anchored in the asphalt because of its weight and the fact that summer heat softens the asphalt, and finally, that at the time of the incident the container was caught in the ice.\n[65] The Tribunal was able to verify this last explanation when it viewed the video and is of the opinion that it would have been difficult for the container to move even after being hit by a truck.\n[66] Mr. M., who was in front of the truck, testified that he heard the noise, just as Mr. Thambiah did, in fact.\n[67] He stated that Mr. L., who was standing beside him during the test, did not have a hammer on him and that hitting a container with a walkie-talkie was unthinkable because it was made of plastic and could easily break.\n[68] Mr. M. added that Mr. L., who was nearing retirement, had a spotless reputation; that there was no reprimand or complaint on his record, even though he had taken part in hundreds of tests.\n[69] To Mr. M., it was clear that the Complainant had hit the container with his truck.\n[70] After viewing the video of the incident, since there is no sound, it is impossible to comment on any noise there might have been. But this is not a problem since even the Complainant said that he had heard the noise.\n[71] It is also impossible to say with certainty, after viewing the video, whether or not the truck actually hit the container. One thing is certain: it was very close to the container.\n[72] We are of the opinion that Mr. M. was well positioned to see what happened and to say that the Complainant hit the container. We accept his version.\n[73] In addition, Mr. M. told the Tribunal that when someone taking a test hits a container, the rule is that the person automatically fails.\nB. Analysis of the 2nd failed test (January 26, 2006) [74] In his letter of December 15, 2006, to Jean B\u00e9dard, vice-president of the MEA, filed as Exhibit R1, Tab 7, the Complainant explained his second failed test, held on January 26, 2006, as follows:\n[translation]\nThe second time (around two o'clock) because of the sun that was going down, the sun was 45 degrees from the ground and I had it perpendicularly in my eyes. It prevented me from seeing the mirror properly. After four attempts at backing up, I wasn't able to back up even once!!\n[75] We examined the video of the January 26 test closely, looking carefully at the ground to spot any clues as to the sun's position. Since there was no shade around objects such as the cones placed on the ground, it is difficult to claim that the sun was present at the time. At least, we do not believe that the sunlight could be blinding.\n[76] The witness, Mr. M., testified that he learned that the Complainant was blaming the sun for his failure of the second test only when he read the Complainant's letter of March 7, 2006, which is filed in the Tribunal's record as Exhibit R1, Tab 2.\n[77] Mr. M. did not notice during the test that the sun might bother the Complainant. He alleged that the Complainant made no mention of the problem caused by the sun either during or after the test.\n[78] And if the sun was bothering him so much, why didn't the Complainant mention it to the evaluator? Why did he not ask that the test be stopped or that he be allowed to back up in another location where the sun would not have bothered him?\n[79] And why did he not mention it at the end of the test when the evaluator told him he had failed?\n[80] The Complainant also tried to blame his second failed test, during his testimony before the Tribunal, on faulty brakes on the trailer.\n[81] The Complainant had already mentioned that factor in a document he filed with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board. See Exhibit R1, Tab 12, page 6, of which we reproduce the following passage:\nOn the January 26th, I was deliberately provided with the faulty truck where the brakes were partially applied on to the remorque. As a result I wasn't able to reverse on straight line. This resulted in a failure in the second driving test. The sequence of events came to light only after the video footage of the evenements released by the employer (Maritime employers association).\n[82] In response, Mr. M. testified that this allegation did not hold water because the type of trailer that the Complainant was driving had no brakes. The truck, naturally, did have brakes. During that period, no other candidate complained about the poor state of truck's brakes and no repairs were done to those brakes.\n[83] Furthermore, the Complainant himself acknowledged that on the morning of January 26, the truck was running well. Here is what he wrote in his letter of March 7, 2006, to the director of training at the MEA, filed in the record as Exhibit R1, Tab 2:\n[translation]\nI failed the truck on Thursday, January 26, 2006. When I practised in the mornings, I had no trouble with the truck.\n[84] In our opinion, after a careful examination of the video, it does not seem to corroborate the Complainant's assertion that the video showed that there was a problem with the brakes.\n[85] Contrary to what the Complainant asserted, we are of the opinion that he made no mention of faulty brakes to the evaluator either during or immediately after the test.\n[86] We therefore cannot consider that the state of the truck's brakes can explain the Complainant's failure to pass his driving test.\n[87] As for the Complainant's allegation contained in the passage quoted above, that I was deliberately provided with the faulty truck where the brakes..., we are of the opinion that it is based on nothing but the imagination of the Complainant, who is desperately seeking an excuse for his failure.\n[88] Nothing in the evidence adduced allows us to believe that the representatives of the MEA committed any deliberate act whatsoever to impair the Complainant in his test or cause him to fail it.\n[89] Rather, we note that throughout his testimony, the Complainant said that after he had passed the lift truck test, the evaluator had congratulated him and patted him on the back to show that he was happy for him. No evidence adduced before the Tribunal could explain why the attitude of the same evaluator would have changed to the point where he would seek to sabotage the Complainant's test.\nC. The 2-test maximum rule [90] The Complainant and witness P-1 told the Tribunal that they were unaware of the two-test maximum rule. Both stated that if they had known about it, they would have prepared themselves accordingly. Witness P-1 said that he would have taken the tests more seriously. Both said that they had never received any notice from the MEA's representatives in this regard.\n[91] Witness M., for his part, testified that the rule already existed when he joined the MEA in 1998 but that he did not know how long it had been in effect.\n[92] He added that the rule, initially unwritten, was put in writing several months later, after the Thambiah incident, once the mass hiring period was over and they had time to do it.\n[93] Confronted with the Complainant's statement that he was never warned of the existence of this rule, he said that the warning was always given during the theoretical phase of training, for both lift truck and truck operators; however, in both cases, he was not present because training was not his responsibility.\n[94] He added that the warning also appeared in the manual that was given to each candidate, filed in the Tribunal's record at pages 14 and 15 of Exhibit R-1, Tab 15. The Tribunal's opinion is that this warning is not sufficiently clear for candidates to take notice of it. Furthermore, we believe that the Complainant received a manual that did not include page 14 and that differed from the document filed in evidence by Witness M.\n[95] He said that he had personally warned the Complainant on January 25 and during the debriefing and when the Complainant failed the first lift truck test.\n[96] Faced with the conflicting statements of the Complainant and witness M., the evaluator of record, we accept the evaluator's version. As we already explained above, the Complainant's credibility is very low.\n[97] Regarding the statements made by the Complainant and some of his witnesses alleging that some candidates had been allowed to take a third test, witness M. said that there had actually been only one candidate who was given a third test, Mr. C-1, whose case is discussed farther on in this judgment.\n[98] At this time, the Tribunal wishes to note that, given the nature of the complaint, it is not for it to assess the fairness or validity of the two-test maximum rule.\n[99] All of the cases submitted for the Tribunal's analysis, including that of the Complainant, showed that the two-test maximum rule was applied regardless of the candidates' age, ethnicity and family ties to members of the MEA. Accordingly, the two-test maximum rule was applied without discrimination against the Complainant.\n[100] The Tribunal, which has on several occasions expressed its unwillingness to interfere with the staffing process unless there is discrimination, decided two cases on the principle that any irregularity in the staffing process is not necessarily conclusive evidence of discrimination. This principle was cited subsequently in several other decisions (see Folch, cited more recently in Morin v. Canada (A.G.), 2005 CHRT 41. http:\/\/www.canlii.org\/en\/ca\/chrt\/doc\/2005\/2005chrt41\/2005chrt41.html; Kibale, cited more recently in Chopra v. Canada (Health and Welfare), 2001 Can LII 8492 (CHRT) http:\/\/www.canlii.org\/en\/ca\/chrt\/doc\/2001\/2001canlii8492\/2001canlii8492.html)\nD. Nepotism at the MEA [101] We will now examine the different cases submitted to the Tribunal in order to determine whether or not there was nepotism.\n(i) Case of NS (candidate of North African origin) [102] Some of the witnesses heard, including the Complainant, referred to the situation of a certain candidate of North African origin, identified here as Mr. C-1, married to an office employee of the MEA, who, after failing two tests, was allowed to make a third attempt.\n[103] The MEA's witness, Mr. M., acknowledged that Mr. C-1 was the only candidate to take three tests and explained what happened.\n[104] After the candidate had failed twice, Mr. M. met with Mr. C-1 and informed him that, under the two-test maximum rule, he was not entitled to a third test.\n[105] Subsequently, Mr. C-1 himself and Union representatives made representations to convince the evaluator that Mr. C-1 had been bothered during his test by the presence of a bus operating on the site where the test was being held, near the truck driven by Mr. C-1.\n[106] The evaluator agreed to view the video shot during Mr. C-1's test. After viewing it and considering the arguments of the candidate and the Union representatives, the evaluator concluded that Mr. C-1 could indeed have been bothered by the incident.\n[107] Since other candidates do not normally have to deal with the presence on the test site of vehicles such as moving buses, the evaluator decided to cancel the second attempt on the ground that it was an exceptional situation and to give the candidate another chance.\n[108] The candidate repeated the test and passed, with the result that the MEA gave him the right to drive a truck in the Port of Montreal.\n[109] We are satisfied with the explanations given by the MEA's representative. There was no irregularity on the part of the MEA in this case.\n(ii) Case of MB (white woman) [110] Witness P-3 told the Tribunal that according to what he had heard, although he had no personal knowledge of the incident, Ms. C-2 had failed the lift truck tests and some time later he had seen her driving a truck.\n[111] Witness P-1, concerning the incident involving Ms. C-2, and without specifying his information sources, testified that she had lost her licence to drive a lift truck and a truck and that after receiving further training, she had recovered her truck driving licence a few months later.\n[112] Witness M. said that he was personally aware of the matter, having been the evaluator of this candidate. He stated that Ms. C-2 first passed the lift truck test and then, on December 4, 2006, the truck test. However, after she had an accident while driving the truck, her classification was withdrawn. She took the training again and, a few days later, her classification was restored.\n[113] The witnesses for the two parties made conflicting statements. Since the Complainant's witnesses had no personal knowledge of the incident, whereas witness M., having such knowledge, was in a better position to discuss the case of Ms. C-2, we accept his version. There was no irregularity on the part of the MEA in this case.\n(iii) Case of C-4 (woman) [114] Witness P-2 told the Tribunal that the husband of Ms. C-4, a longshoreman in the second reserve, had told him that his wife had failed the test twice. He alleged that two weeks later he saw her driving a truck in the Port of Montreal. It should be noted that it was only after considerable confusion that this witness managed to situate the incident of Ms. C-4 in time.\n[115] Witness M. testified that he was personally aware of this matter. However, he thought it necessary to note that he knew the name of Ms. C-4's husband, and that witness P-2 was not using the right name to identify this candidate. Lastly, he noted that, contrary to what is alleged in the preceding paragraph, this woman, after failing a first test on the lift truck on April 11, 2006, passed the second test on April 12 of the same year.\n[116] We cannot give credence to the information provided by this witness, who, in addition to providing inaccurate dates and information, had no personal knowledge of the incident, while witness M. was in a better position to discuss the matter of Ms. C-2, since he had evaluated her. Here again, it seems to the Tribunal that there was no irregularity on the part of the MEA in this case.\n(iv) Case of AM (white man) [117] Witness P-3 told the Tribunal that Mr. C-3 failed the truck driving test twice; that the candidate's father went to the MEA to loudly express his frustration to Mr. G.C. and allege that his son had failed the truck-driving test; that he had better pass him; and that Mr. C-3 had then passed the test, in fact he himself had seen him driving the truck.\n[118] Witness M. testified that he had evaluated Mr. A.M for truck driving on March 28, 2006, and that he had passed on the first attempt.\n[119] We prefer to believe Mr. M., who, in addition to being familiar with the matter, seemed to us more credible.\n(v) Case of the brother of an MEA office employee [120] Witness M., in order to show that there is no nepotism at the MEA, told the Tribunal that he had evaluated the brother of the wife of the North African candidate, the one who had been given a third test. He added that the man had failed his test, even though his sister worked for the MEA.\n(vi) Cases of persons who failed tests [121] Witness M., as director of labour relations and workforce at the MEA, when questioned about the number of people who had failed tests at that time, was able to state that there were only a few cases out of several hundred candidates whom he had evaluated.\n[122] Pressed to provide names, he was able to give the following examples:\nMr. C-7, who failed the fork lift test twice, was over 50 years old, not a member of a visible minority and was referred by the Union; Mr. C-5, who failed the truck test twice, was between 30 and 40 years old, not a member of a visible minority and, he believed, was referred by the Union; Ms. C-6, who failed the truck test twice, was about 50 years old, not a member of a visible minority and was referred by the Union; Mr. C-8, who failed the truck test twice, was over 50 years old, not a member of a visible minority and was not referred by the Union.\n[123] Lastly, he pointed out that each of those longshore workers continued to work in the second reserve even after failing the test.\n(vii) Document of the Lists Committee [124] Further to what witness P-1 told the Tribunal about a document that was allegedly posted at the end of 2005, part of which dealt with the age of future candidates for the position of longshore worker, we think it necessary to state our position regarding that document.\n[125] During the hearing, Mr. R., a member of the Union, testified that this was merely a working document drafted by the Union's Lists Committee. At no time was the document adopted by the Union or discussed with representatives of the MEA.\n[126] For these reasons, we wish to note that this document is not part of the evidence on which the Tribunal will base its decision.\nVIII. ISSUE [127] Having completed our analysis of the many substantive questions, we can now turn our attention to the issue.\n[128] At the beginning of the hearing, Deborah Mankovitz, after being invited by the Chairperson of the Tribunal to read closely the Issue that appears on page 6 of the Respondent's Statement, as drafted by Daniel Leduc, and to comment on it, said that she was in agreement with its wording, as reproduced below:\n[translation]\nWas the Complainant discriminated against by the Respondent on the basis of his age, family status and\/or national or ethnic origin in the evaluation of his ability to hold the classification of truck operator, an essential condition of access to the first reserve?\n[129] In view of Ms. Mankovitz's decision, before making her argument, to drop those parts of the complaint that concerned ethnicity and age, the new issue becomes the following:\n[translation]\nWas the Complainant discriminated against by the Respondent on the basis of his family status in the evaluation of his ability to hold the classification of truck operator, an essential condition of access to the first reserve?\n[130] The Tribunal adopts the issue as framed by counsel for both parties.\nIX. PRIMA FACIE EVIDENCE [131] Disregarding the Respondent's evidence, the evidence adduced by the Complainant shows that the representatives of the MEA decided that the Complainant had failed the truck driving test twice and was not entitled to take a third test.\n[132] The Complainant disagrees with the outcome of the two tests and accuses the Respondent of having discriminated against him on the basis that he had no family ties to employees of the MEA.\n[133] He is of the opinion that both the trainer and the evaluator did everything to sabotage his evaluation.\n[134] The Complainant cannot accept that he was denied the right to make more than two attempts to pass the truck driving test.\n[135] He asserts that the two-test maximum rule was invented the day he failed his second test.\n[136] The Complainant and some of his witnesses told the Tribunal that certain longshore workers had been allowed more than two attempts to pass the lift truck and truck tests.\n[137] They said that family ties connecting those candidates with MEA office employees explained why they were not held to the same rules as others, such as the Complainant.\n[138] However, the Complainant and his witnesses acknowledged that they had no personal knowledge of the facts they reported to the Tribunal. They admitted that they had the information from people they had talked to.\n[139] Although a large portion of the information provided by the Complainant and his witnesses was based on hearsay, we are of the opinion that the Complainant succeeded in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination.\nX. CONCLUSION [140] With respect to the first truck driving test, held on January 25, 2006, we cannot accept the explanations provided by the Complainant. We accept that the Complainant hit the container with his truck and refuse to believe that the noise heard was caused by a tool used by the trainer. We do not accept the idea that the MEA representative wanted to sabotage the Complainant's test. The test proceeded normally and the Complainant failed.\n[141] With respect to the second test, which was held on January 26, 2006, we cannot accept the Complainant's allegation that he failed because of the sun or that the truck's brakes were faulty. We do not accept the idea that the MEA representative wanted to sabotage the Complainant's test. The test proceeded normally and the Complainant failed.\n[142] With respect to the two-test maximum rule, it is our opinion that, although the rule was not written down, it had existed since at least 1998. It was written down after the incident involving the Complainant but not because of him. It was applied to all cases submitted for our consideration, and not only to the Complainant. This rule was in no way applied in a discriminatory manner against the Complainant.\n[143] With respect to nepotism at the MEA, the evidence presented before the Tribunal did not demonstrate to our satisfaction the existence of nepotism in hiring practices at the MEA. We found no instance of a longshore worker obtaining the truck operator classification because of family ties to members, managers or shareholders of the MEA.\n[144] Based on the evidence submitted, we must answer in the negative the issue as already stated, which is:\nWas the Complainant discriminated against by the Respondent on the basis of his family status in the evaluation of his ability to hold the classification of truck operator, an essential condition of access to the first reserve?\n[145] Accordingly, we dismiss the complaint of discrimination filed by the Complainant.\nXI. WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE REMEDY? [146] During the hearing, the Tribunal informed the parties that in the event that the Complainant succeeded, it reserved the right to receive all necessary evidence to assess the remedy sought.\n[147] Since the Tribunal has found that the Complainant did not succeed in proving that the Respondent discriminated against him, we do not consider it necessary at this stage to make any determination as to remedial action.\nSigned by R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nOTTAWA, Ontario April 15, 2010\nPARTIES OF RECORD\nTRIBUNAL FILE:\nT1365\/9508\nSTYLE OF CAUSE:\nRamanan Thambiah v.

The basic premise for the complaint\nVIII. Conclusion\nSchedule 1\n[1] The complainant Cathy Murphy was a federal public servant from 1981 to 1994. The other complainant, the Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), was her union. In 2000, Ms. Murphy, along with many other federal public servants who were employed in predominantly female occupational groups, received payments from the Treasury Board of Canada in settlement of two wage discrimination complaints that the PSAC had filed pursuant to s. 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (CHRA).\n[2] The payments (commonly referred to as pay equity payments) included retroactive compensation regarding the employees' wages from 1985 onwards. These lump-sum payments were deemed for income tax purposes to be employment income in the year 2000 even though they related to employment that had occurred years earlier. Ms. Murphy was taxed at a higher marginal rate in 2000 than in previous years, so she claims that she effectively received less money than she would have received had the payments actually been made in each of those years.\n[3] The Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (ITA) contains a series of provisions offering some tax relief to individuals receiving lump sum payments relating to income earned in previous years. The Respondent, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), administers Canada's tax laws, including this relief mechanism. The Complainants allege that the manner in which the CRA has interpreted, applied, and administered this system has, in the vast majority of cases, prevented recipients of retroactive income payments relating to pay equity, like Ms. Murphy, from benefitting from the tax relief.\n[4] The Complainants contend that the CRA thereby breached s. 5 of the CHRA by discriminating against Ms. Murphy and the other pay equity recipients on the basis of sex, in the provision of services customarily available to the general public. The Complainants claim that the CRA also adversely differentiated on the basis of sex, in relation to Ms. Murphy and other pay equity recipients, in the course of employment, which would constitute a violation of s 7(b) of the CHRA. For the reasons given in the following decision, I find that the complaint has not been substantiated.\nI. The Cra's Organizational History [5] The responsibility for the administration of Canada's tax system has changed over the years. The Department of National Revenue (Revenue Canada) was created in 1927 and was given the responsibility to administer Canada's laws regarding taxation as well as customs and excise.\n[6] On November 1, 1999, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Act, S.C. 1999, c. 17, came into force (SI\/99-111), transforming the department's status to that of an independent agency responsible for national revenue, called the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (CCRA). In December 2005, the CCRA's name was changed to the Canada Revenue Agency and the newly-created Canada Border Services Agency assumed responsibility for Canada's customs operations. Throughout this decision, I will usually be referring to the Respondent as the CRA, even when discussing events arising prior to the more recent name change.\nII. The Pay Equity Cases [7] During most of her career with the federal public service, Ms. Murphy was employed at Revenue Canada. She occupied positions that were principally classified in the CR (clerical and regulatory) occupational group. The PSAC was the union for the CR group of employees. In 1984 and 1990, the PSAC, acting on behalf of federal public service employees in six occupational groups, filed complaints under s. 11 of the CHRA against the Treasury Board of Canada (the Section 11 Complaints). The complaints alleged that the employees of these six occupational groups were predominantly female and that they earned lower wages than those earned by public servants employed in predominantly male occupational groups who performed work of equal value.\n[8] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred the Section 11 Complaints to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) in October 1990 and hearings commenced one year later. By July 1998, the parties to the Section 11 Complaints were aware that the Tribunal was about to release its decision. PSAC members had begun expressing concerns to the union regarding the tax implications of the Tribunal's decision. One of these concerns was in relation to whether a lump-sum compensation payment would put recipients into a higher tax bracket in the year that it was paid. In anticipation of this possibility, representatives of the PSAC, including PSAC Classification and Equal Pay Officer Margaret Jaekl, met with Revenue Canada representatives to ask a number of questions, including what the tax treatment of pay equity adjustments would be.\n[9] Revenue Canada advised the PSAC that under s. 5(1) of the ITA, any lump-sum wage payment must be fully included in the income for the year in which it is received. No legislation existed that would enable a retroactive employment income payment to be taxed for the years to which it relates or to be taxed at a special rate.\n[10] On July 29, 1998, the Tribunal found the Section 11 Complaints to be substantiated and established a methodology for calculating the wage gap between the female and male dominated occupational groups that was the source of the discrimination (Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Treasury Board) (1998), 32 C.H.R.R. D\/349). The Tribunal ordered the Treasury Board to make retroactive wage adjustment payments to the affected federal public service employees from 1985 to the date of the decision. The Tribunal also ordered the Treasury Board to pay simple interest calculated semi-annually at the Canada Savings Bond rate on the wage adjustments.\n[11] The Attorney General of Canada filed an application for judicial review of the Tribunal Decision in the Federal Court, but the Court upheld the Tribunal's decision on October 19, 1999 (Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service Alliance of Canada [2000] 1 F.C. 146 (T.D.)).\n[12] Within a matter of days following the Court judgment, representatives of the PSAC and the Treasury Board Secretariat commenced talks in the hope of coming to an agreement on all outstanding issues, including the determination of the actual wage adjustment amounts. The Tribunal had not directly addressed this matter in its 1998 decision, having deferred it to a subsequent hearing phase known as Phase III. According to Ms. Jaekl, who sat in on most of these discussions, the Treasury Board Secretary attended the first day's meeting and laid out [the Treasury Board]'s terms of how the negotiations would operate. The PSAC representatives were told that if these terms were not agreed to, the Treasury Board would end talks and proceed with an appeal of the Federal Court decision. These terms included a requirement that any agreement would have to be reached by noon of the third day (a Wednesday). In addition, the parties' lawyers were not to participate in the settlement discussions.\n[13] Ms. Jaekl testified that although she was not present during every discussion between officials, to her knowledge, the PSAC did not raise tax implications during the meetings. She explained that the union was focussed on trying to reach an agreement on the implementation of the Tribunal's decision, which alone raised so many issues, that there was insufficient time to consider matters that did not comprise part of the decision.\n[14] The negotiations were successful and a memorandum of agreement was drafted and signed on October 29, 1999. Article 13 of the document was entitled Settlement and stated that the parties agree that the terms of this agreement settle all Phase II and Phase III issues relating to the complaints. As I explained earlier, Phase III relates to the determination of the wage adjustment.\n[15] On November 16, 1999, counsel for the PSAC, the Commission and the Treasury Board presented the settlement agreement to the Tribunal. The Tribunal members asked questions and sought clarification of certain parts of the agreement, following which the Tribunal approved the agreement and issued a consent order (Consent Order).\n[16] In 2000, those federal government departments responsible for the current and former public service employees subject to the Consent Order made the requisite adjustment and interest payments. Cheques were issued in three or four instalments between April and November 2000.\nIII. When and how were the income tax provisions at issue in this case adopted? [17] On February 16, 1999, the federal Minister of Finance announced that as part of the next federal budget, the ITA would be amended to introduce a new approach to computing tax on certain retroactive lump sum payments. This budgetary proposal was described in the Budget Plan, a document prepared by the Finance Department that the Minister tabled in Parliament. Under Canada's progressive income tax system, tax rates increase as taxable income increases. The Budget Plan observed that due to this progressivity, an individual's tax liability on retroactive lump-sum payments was usually higher than it would have been if payments had been made, and taxed, year by year as the income arose. This higher tax liability represented increased revenue for the government.\n[18] As a means of ensuring that the government would not unduly benefit from the progressivity of the personal tax system, the budget proposed the implementation of the Qualifying Retroactive Lump-Sum Payment (QRLSP) mechanism. A qualifying retroactive lump-sum payment would be considered to be the principal (i.e., non-interest) portion of a payment received in a given year, but which related to a preceding year. The mechanism would only apply with respect to lump-sum payments of $3,000 or more, derived from a number of specified sources including income from employment or income received due to a termination of employment, received under the terms of a court judgment, arbitration award or in settlement of a lawsuit. The lump-sum payments received by Ms. Murphy pursuant to the settlement of the Section 11 Complaints and subsequent Consent Order related to her employment and exceeded $3,000. They were thus qualified, for the purposes of the QRLSP mechanism.\n[19] Donald Wilson was a policy advisor with the Department of Finance during the period when the QRLSP measure was developed. He testified that the general principle set out in s. 5(1) of the ITA, that income is taxable in the year in which it is received, had always been a source of concern for many taxpayers, particularly those who had uneven income streams, such as artists. These individuals were frequently petitioning for relief in their tax treatment.\n[20] However, in the period leading up to the QRLSP measure's announcement in the budget, the Finance Department had been in receipt of numerous requests for relief from members of two specific employee groups. The first was comprised of 25,000 Ontario teachers who were receiving retirement benefits that should have been paid to them in prior years. The second group consisted of longshoremen based in Quebec who had been awarded retroactive salary payments by a court order. Mr. Wilson acknowledged that the Finance Department was also aware at the time that the pay equity settlement and that the lump sum payments pursuant thereto were in the works. He emphasized, however, that the QRLSP was not tailored to benefit any particular group but was merely designed after having looked at the specifics of the different cases that had been brought to the department's attention.\nIV. How WAS the QRLSP mechanism TO FUNCTION? [21] As proposed in the budget, the mechanism provided for a special notional tax calculation to be made by allocating the qualifying lump-sums retroactively to the years to which they relate and calculating the notional additional tax for those years. However, the notional tax was not just comprised of the tax that would have been payable in those years. It was also to include an interest amount to reflect the delay in payment of tax on the retroactive lump-sum payment. The Budget Plan had noted that governments incurred financing costs when they received tax revenues later than if the payment had been made earlier, when due.\n[22] This interest component of the notional tax was to be calculated using the prescribed interest rates for tax refunds, i.e. the interest rate paid by the Minister when refunding tax to a taxpayer. Since October 1, 1989, the prescribed rate for refunds under the ITA has been calculated as the 90-day Treasury Bill rate plus two percent (Income Tax Regulations, C.R.C., c. 945, s. 4301). Since January 1, 1987, interest has been computed on a daily compounded basis (ss. 164 and 248(11) of the ITA).\n[23] On September 10, 1999, the draft legislation amending the ITA that included the provisions relating to the QRLSP was tabled (Bill C-25). The provisions came into force on June 29, 2000 (ss. 110.2 and 120.31, the full texts of which I have attached to the present decision as Schedule 1). The provisions as enacted had no material differences from the proposals in the 1999 budget. The CRA had identified one obvious drafting error in how the calculation would be performed that was clearly inconsistent with the budget proposal. The CRA brought the error to the attention of the Finance Department, which in turn confirmed that the CRA's observation was correct. The CRA has consequently applied the provisions in the corrected fashion, although Parliament has yet to amend the provision to rectify the error.\n[24] Ms. Jaekl testified that when the budget was first presented in Parliament in February 1999, she became aware of the proposed QRLSP mechanism, but did not learn about or inquire into any of its details. She knew from experience that merely because a proposal is announced in Parliament does not necessarily mean it will ultimately be passed into law. She understood, however, that if the mechanism was implemented, it had the potential to benefit pay equity recipients. She only acquired a more fulsome understanding of the QRLSP during a conference that she attended in Halifax on March 8, 2000, at which one of the speakers had provided a detailed explanation of how the mechanism would work. This conference took place over four months after the PSAC and the Treasury Board had negotiated the settlement of the Section 11 Complaints.\n[25] No evidence was adduced indicating that Ms. Murphy or any representative of the PSAC had contacted the CRA prior to signing the pay equity settlement to obtain details about the QRLSP mechanism nor that anyone had contacted the Finance Department or other government representatives to request or lobby for any change in regard to how the mechanism would function.\nV. How has the CRA administered the QRLSP? [26] Ever since the QRLSP provisions came into force, taxpayers who have been in receipt of qualifying lump-sums have been able to apply to the CRA to learn if they can benefit from this tax relief. Sheila Barnard is the manager of the legislation section in the Individual Returns and Payments Processing Directorate of the CRA, which is responsible for establishing the processes involved in assessing personal income tax. She pointed out that the QRLSP provision enabled taxpayers to allocate their qualifying lump sums as far back as 1978. The CRA recognized that few people keep their tax records for so many years and that the agency, on the other hand, possessed that data in its computer system.\n[27] The CRA was therefore in a position to perform the QRLSP calculation for taxpayers and established a process to achieve that result. It developed a special form (T1198), which taxpayers could attach to their tax returns. The form has usually been completed by their employer. If the taxpayers file electronically, the T1198 figures are keyed in. The name of the lump-sum recipient appears on the T1198 form as well as the year in which the lump-sum was received. The amount is broken down between principal and interest. There are then a series of blank spaces identified by year from 1978 (the earliest year to which the QRLSP mechanism's relief extends) to the current taxation year. The amount of principal relating to each year is entered into the appropriate blank spaces. In the case of the federal public service pay equity payments, the employer issued a Form T1198 to all recipients.\n[28] Ms. Barnard testified that upon receipt of an income tax return with a T1198 form or an equivalent electronically filed return, the CRA assessing system automatically performs both the regular tax calculation and the special QRLSP tax calculation, provided the portion of the principal relating to prior years is $3,000 or more.\n[29] Ms. Barnard explained that the special QRLSP tax calculation is performed as follows:\nThe amount of the qualifying retroactive lump-sum payment is deducted in computing the taxable income in the year in which the lump-sum was received (the Current Year). Basic federal tax is computed on the reduced taxable income of the Current Year using the tax rates and non-refundable tax credits applicable in the Current Year. A tax adjustment (which is an addition to the basic federal tax) is calculated as a total of:\nAll amounts each of which would be the increase to the basic federal tax for each preceding year, calculated as if the relevant portion of the lump-sum had been received in the year to which it relates, and Interest computed on the increase to basic federal tax for each preceding year, using the prescribed refund rate, from May 1 of the year following the year to which the portion of the lump-sum relates to the end of the year preceding the year in which the lump-sum is received.\nThe tax adjustment is added to the basic federal tax on the reduced taxable income for the Current Year.\n[30] Once the CRA has completed this calculation, it then compares the results of the regular tax calculation (i.e., taxing the lump-sum in full in the Current Year) with the special QRLSP calculation to determine the method that is most advantageous to the taxpayer. If the QRLSP tax calculation is more advantageous, the CRA uses it to assess the return for the Current Year. If the QRLSP is of no benefit, the CRA assesses the return using the regular tax calculation. The CRA then issues a Notice of Assessment or Reassessment with an explanation indicating whether the QRLSP tax calculation was beneficial, followed by a letter to the taxpayer explaining the calculation and comparison in detail.\n[31] Simply put, the exercise consists of recalculating the Current Year's federal income tax without the lump-sum, and then adding to that tax the amount of federal income tax that would have been payable had the lump-sum amounts been paid in the years to which they related. If the lump-sum has placed the taxpayer into a higher tax bracket in the Current Year, then logically, assessing the taxpayer at the lower marginal tax rates that he or she was paying in prior years would result in a reduction of tax payable. However, there is one other factor to be taken into account - the interest that also forms part of the calculation. When the compounded interest is added, the likely effect is that any benefit from calculating the income tax payable on retroactive payments at the lower marginal rates is negated to varying extents by the compound interest that is included in the calculation. For this reason, retroactive payments extending back six years or more are not likely to benefit from the QRLSP mechanism.\nVI. What was the effect of the QRLSP calculation on Ms. Murphy's tax treatment? [32] After leaving the federal public service in 1994, Ms. Murphy became an employee of the PSAC. By the time she received her pay equity lump-sum payments in 2000, her employment income had increased significantly from the levels she had been earning as a public servant. She was now in a higher tax bracket. She received three cheques pursuant to the Consent Order, two representing the principal of the wage adjustment (a total of $16,282.26), and the other cheque representing the interest to which she was entitled in the amount of $9,266.03. When these sums were combined with her earned income in 2000, her total income came to $93,452.\n[33] The CRA issued a 2000 Notice of Assessment to Ms. Murphy on April 18, 2001, advising her that she was eligible for the QRLSP tax calculation. On April 25, 2001, the CRA sent a letter explaining that the calculation did not benefit her. The regular tax calculation was more beneficial even though her marginal tax rate was now higher than when she worked for the public service. The table accompanying the letter, which explained the calculation, showed that when the pay equity lump-sums (wage adjustment and interest) were included in her taxable income for 2000, her basic federal tax was $15,433.23. The QRLSP calculation would have resulted in basic federal tax in the amount of $18,494.65.\n[34] Thus, although Ms. Murphy's income was greater now and therefore subject to a higher marginal tax rate, she could not benefit from any tax relief under the QRLSP mechanism. She considered this unfair. Had she actually received the wage adjustments in the years to which they related, she would have paid tax at a lower marginal rate. She was particularly upset that the QRLSP calculation incorporated an interest component that was set at the refund rate and that it was compounded, particularly since the Consent Order had only provided for the payment of simple interest. She perceived the situation as one where the CRA was assessing interest on arrears relating to income that she had never received.\n[35] Ms. Murphy was not alone in her consternation. Numerous pay equity lump-sum payment recipients contacted the PSAC to complain about the QRLSP. On April 2, 2001, the PSAC issued a bulletin to its members indicating that it was considering launching a challenge to this practice on human rights grounds. On June 21, 2001, the PSAC president wrote to the Minister of National Revenue regarding the issue, alleging that the practice was discriminatory. On July 12, 2001, a senior representative from the Minister's department replied by letter, stating that these calculations are an integral part of the retroactive lump sum payment legislation as enacted by Parliament, and do not always result in reduced taxes for lump sum payment recipients. He indicated that the CRA had made every effort in 1999 and 2000 to ensure that recipients of pay equity payments were aware that the QRLSP calculation would not necessarily provide a beneficial result. CRA publications had noted that generally the further back the retroactive entitlement, the smaller the tax savings, if any. He also pointed out that components of the tax calculation for retroactive lump sum payments were a matter of tax policy that is the responsibility of the Finance Department. The CRA was merely responsible for administering the legislation.\n[36] Ms. Murphy had been in contact with Ms. Jaekl and expressed a willingness to put forward her situation as a basis for a test case. Consequently, on March 11, 2002, the PSAC and Ms. Murphy filed the present human rights complaint with the Commission. The complaint alleged that the CRA maintains the following discriminatory practice:\n...charging compound interest at high rates on notional tax arrears which result from attributing income received due to the order of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal dated November 16, 1999. This practice is discriminatory on the ground of sex (female) in that it prevents affected persons from receiving equal pay for work of equal value, as required by Section 11 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, by reducing the actual value of the payments ordered, contrary to sections 5 and 7(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act. These practices have, therefore, had the effect of reducing the payments made pursuant to Section 11 of the Act to affected persons in a manner inconsistent with Section 11 of the Act.\n[37] Despite the reference in the complaint to s. 11, the Complainants did not allege before the Tribunal that the CRA was in breach of that provision.\nVII. Analysis [38] In the adjudication of human rights complaints, complainants must ordinarily first establish a prima facie case of discrimination (Ont. Human Rights Comm. v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536 at para. 28 (O'Malley)). A prima facie case, in this context, is one that covers the allegations made and which, if the allegations are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant's favour, in the absence of an answer from the respondent. If the complainant establishes a prima facie case of discrimination, then the onus shifts to the respondent to disprove the allegations or prove that there is a reasonable explanation justifying what may appear to be a discriminatory practice. If such an explanation is given, it then falls upon the complainant to demonstrate that the explanation is merely a pretext for the otherwise discriminatory behaviour.\n[39] It is not necessary that discriminatory considerations be the sole reason for the actions at issue in order for the complaint to be substantiated. It is sufficient that the discrimination be one of the factors in the impugned decision or action (Holden v. Canadian National Railway Company (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 at para 7 (F.C.A.); Canada (Attorney General) v. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 F.C. 569 (T.D.)).\nA. Does the alleged discriminatory practice regarding the QRLSP mechanism arise from the provision of services within the meaning of s. 5? [40] The Complainants and the Commission allege that the CRA has engaged in a discriminatory practice in the provision of services customarily available to the general public, pursuant to s. 5 of the CHRA, which provides as follows:\n5.It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n5.Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d'installations ou de moyens d'h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d'en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l'occasion de leur fourniture.\n[41] The Complainants did not advance any submissions or evidence to the effect that a service was denied to Ms. Murphy or the other recipients of pay equity payments. I conclude from this that the allegation of discrimination is grounded in s. 5(b) - adverse differentiation in relation to an individual in the provision of services customarily available to the general public.\n[42] What is a service customarily available to the general public, particularly with regard to activities of public bodies like the CRA? Are all practices of government officials in the performance of their statutory duties services within the meaning of s. 5, as the Tribunal had suggested in Bailey v. Minister of National Revenue (1980), 1 C.H.R.R. D\/193, at D\/214? The Federal Court of Appeal, in the case of Canada (Attorney General) v. Watkin, 2008 FCA 170, explicitly disavowed this opinion. The Court stated, at paras. 31-2, that all government actions in the performance of a statutory function do not constitute services merely because they are undertaken by the public service for the public good. Services, within the meaning of s. 5, contemplate something of benefit being `held out' as services and `offered' to the public.\n[43] The Complainants submit that the determination by the CRA of whether a particular taxpayer would benefit from the application of QRLSP provisions, especially when viewed in light of Parliament's aim of increasing fairness and reducing the tax burden of Canadians through the 1999 budget amendments, is intended to provide a benefit to the public. Accordingly, the Complainants submit that the CRA provided a service to pay equity recipients like Ms. Murphy.\n[44] The Complainants claim that the CRA's dealings regarding the QRLSP provisions are couched in terms of actions for the benefit of taxpayers. The CRA developed software to make the calculations required by these provisions. The Complainants pointed out that in at least one of the documents instructing the software developers on how the QRLSP mechanism functions, taxpayers are referred to as clients. The CRA ran tests to verify the accuracy of the software once it was developed. It trained staff who handled inquires from the public to advise taxpayers on how the QRLSP mechanism functions. The CRA has also issued information bulletins intended for the public, explaining the mechanism.\n[45] Once the CRA receives the T1198 form from the taxpayer, its staff keys the data into its information system. The CRA identifies and screens out applicants who have not received lump-sum payments that are qualified for the tax relief (e.g., under $3,000). The CRA's information system performs the calculations provided in the legislation and produces the results that are then reflected in the tables and letters sent to the taxpayers, in which they are advised whether using the QRLSP mechanism is more beneficial to them than the ordinary tax treatment of their lump-sum payments.\n[46] The Complainants submit the above sorts of actions on the part of the CRA come within the meaning of services customarily available to the public articulated in s. 5. They point out that although Watkin disavowed the opinion expressed in Bailey suggesting that all government activity is a service, the Federal Court of Appeal did not disavow the specific finding in Bailey that the discretion exercised by the Minister of Revenue in disallowing several tax deductions constitutes a service.\n[47] Moreover, the Complainants directed me to another passage in Watkin, at para. 28, in which the Court provided some examples of government actions that could constitute a service for the purposes of s. 5:\nPublic authorities can and do engage in the provision of services in fulfilling their statutory functions. For example, the Canada Revenue Agency provides a service when it issues advance income tax rulings; Environment Canada provides a service when it publicizes weather and road conditions; Health Canada provides a service when it encourages Canadians to take an active role in their health by increasing their level of physical activity and eating well; Immigration Canada provides a service when it advises immigrants about how to become a Canadian resident. That said, not all government actions are services. Before relief can be provided for discrimination in the provision of services, the particular actions complained of must be shown to be services [...].\n(emphasis added)\n[48] Not surprisingly, the Complainants see no real distinction between advance income tax rulings and QRLSP assessments. In either case, a taxpayer requests a calculation from the CRA. Ms. Barnard testified that advance income tax rulings are provided to taxpayers for a fee, to assist them in deciding whether to undertake a particular course of action in light of the tax consequences that will ensue. An information circular published by the CRA states that advance income tax rulings are provided as an administrative service but there is no legal requirement to issue them. However, the CRA argued that, in contrast, the assessment of taxes actually owing by taxpayers under the ITA is not an optional prospective tool; rather it is the ultimate application of the ITA in furtherance of tax collection. The CRA submits that there is therefore a distinction to be drawn between the QRLSP calculation provided by the CRA and advance income tax rulings.\n[49] The Commission for its part concurs that the assessment of income tax is a service. The Commission noted that a taxpayer has a duty to comply with the ITA and pay any taxes he or she may owe. The benefit that the CRA provides to taxpayers like Ms. Murphy in making the QRLSP calculation and providing the results to her is that she is thereby enabled to fulfill her obligations pursuant to the ITA and pay the appropriate amount of federal income tax. Assisting taxpayers to fulfill their duties to pay taxes is the service being provided and made available to the public by the CRA.\n[50] In my view, however, whether or not the calculation pursuant to the QRLSP provisions or even assessment of income tax constitutes a service is immaterial to the real question with respect to s. 5. Even if these activities do constitute a service, they are not what is at issue in this case. Rather, it is the terms of the ITA and its regulations that are at issue.\n[51] In this sense, the circumstances of the present case are not unlike those in Forward v. Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2008 CHRT 5. The complainants in that case were two brothers who are American. Their mother is a Canadian citizen and they had sought to obtain Canadian citizenship through their mother's citizenship. Their application was denied by Citizenship and Immigration Canada because at the time of their birth, neither of their parents held Canadian citizenship. They did not qualify for citizenship under the parental lineage provisions of the Citizenship Act, R.S.C, 1985, c. C-29.\n[52] The complainants in Forward alleged that the rejection of their citizenship applications amounted to adverse differentiation in the provision of services customarily available to the general public (s. 5(b)). They argued that was at issue was not citizenship per se but rather the right of someone claiming citizenship to have his or her application reviewed and administered in a non-discriminatory manner. The reviewing of applications for citizenship was accordingly a service.\n[53] The Tribunal, at paras. 37-8, rejected this characterization, noting that the evidence and argument in the case was not directed at the conduct of ministerial officials, the exercise of discretion, or at the implementation of departmental policies and practices. The sole source of the alleged discrimination was the legislative language of the Citizenship Act. The Tribunal pointed out that in reviewing the application for citizenship, the officials did nothing more than apply categorical statutory criteria to undisputed facts. Any issue taken with the application review process was really an issue taken with the Citizenship Act.\n[54] In my opinion, these findings are equally applicable to the present case. Even if the tasks undertaken by the CRA in processing QRLSP claims constitute a service, they are not the basis for the adverse differentiation alleged in the complaint. The source of the alleged discriminatory practice is found solely within the legislative language of ss. 110.2 and 120.31 of the ITA. None of the evidence before me establishes that the alleged discrimination arises from the conduct of CRA officials or the discretionary implementation of policies or practices by the CRA. The CRA applies the formula as set out in the ITA using each applicant taxpayer's tax data. Presumably, taxpayers armed with their own prior tax data could perform the mathematical exercise for themselves, without the CRA's involvement.\n[55] There is no evidence suggesting that the CRA did not perform Ms. Murphy's QRLSP calculation in accordance with s. 110.2 and 120.31 of the ITA. Since the CRA already possesses taxpayers' prior tax filing information as well as the technological resources to efficiently perform the QRLSP calculation, it has undertaken this task. It could perhaps be argued that the CRA does exercise some discretion in the screening process of the QRLSP provision by determining if a particular lump-sum is qualified under the provision. That is not at issue in the present case, however. The CRA had accepted that Ms. Murphy's and the other recipients' lump-sum payments were qualified provided, of course, that the sums exceeded $3,000.\n[56] The Complainants suggested that the CRA could have, in its discretion, waived the interest portion of the QRLSP calculation. According to the QRLSP provisions of the ITA, however, the interest portion is deemed to be tax. Ms. Barnard testified that under the applicable fairness provisions, the CRA can only waive interest, not tax (s. 220(3.1) of the ITA). It was not open to the CRA to exercise any discretion in this regard.\n[57] In sum, the source of the alleged discriminatory practice is not, in whole or in part, the CRA's activities, be they a service customarily available to the public or not, but rather exclusively the tax legislation itself. In Wignall v. Canada (Department of National Revenue (Taxation), 2003 FC 1280, at para. 30, the Federal Court noted that the conduct of Revenue Canada cannot be held to be discriminatory under the CHRA when what is really being impugned is a provision of the ITA.\n[58] Accordingly, where the alleged discrimination, as in the present case, arises solely from the legislative language of the ITA and not the activities of the CRA, it is not as a result of the provision of services by the CRA, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA. Consequently, a prima facie case pursuant to that section cannot be substantiated.\n[59] If I am wrong, however, and the alleged discriminatory practice does constitute a service within the meaning of s. 5, I still find that the Complainants have not established a case of adverse differentiation on a prohibited ground in the provision of that service, for the reasons that I provide later in this decision.\nB. Can the CRA's administration of the QRLSP mechanism be considered to have been made in the course of employment within the meaning of s. 7(b)? [60] Section 7(b) of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice to directly or indirectly differentiate adversely in relation to an employee, in the course of employment:\n<7.It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(...)\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n7.Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\n(...)\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n[61] The Complainants contend that in its application of the QRLSP provisions, the CRA has affected the pay equity payments of Ms. Murphy and the other recipients by making their net income less than what it would have been had the Treasury Board complied with s. 11 of the CHRA in the first place and paid them their fair wages. In other words, the CRA's actions have had the effect of reducing the portions of their wages (the pay equity payments) that were otherwise intended to make them whole. The Complainants contend that this constitutes an indirect form of adverse differentiation in the course of Ms. Murphy's and the other recipients' employment, in breach of s.7(b).\n[62] Although Ms. Murphy happened to have worked at Revenue Canada during her career in the public service, her complaint against the CRA today does not arise on account of that relationship but rather due to the CRA's assessment of her lump-sum payments pursuant to its role as the administrator of the ITA.\n[63] In this capacity as administrator of the income tax system, can the CRA be found to have differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Murphy in the course of employment? The Complainants argue that s. 7(b) does not require the respondent to be the direct employer of the complainant. They contend that the scope of the provision should be interpreted broadly, relying on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Canadian Pacific Limited v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1991] 1 F.C. 571, which held that in the context of s. 7, employment should be given a broader meaning [...] than that afforded by the technical master\/servant relationship.\n[64] However, in this and the other decisions raised by the Complainants in their final submissions (Yukon (Human Rights Commission) v. Yukon (Human Rights Board of Adjudication), 2009 YKSC 44; Tulk v. Newfoundland (Ministry of Health and Community Services), [2002] N.J. No. 65 (Nfld.S.C.T.D.)(QL)), while the respondents were not formally the employers of the persons who had filed the complaints, they were found to have utilized their services. In Canadian Pacific and Yukon, the complainants were employed by contractors who had entered into agreements with the respondents for the provision of services. In Tulk, the respondent government department had provided funds to an individual for the purpose of hiring the complainant, but the department retained a measure of control over the relationship including the right to withhold funds for the remuneration of the service provider, which would have effectively resulted in her termination.\n[65] The common element in all of these cases is that the respondents utilized the complainants' services, albeit indirectly. As taxpayers, however, Ms. Murphy and the other pay equity payment recipients did not have a similar relationship with the CRA. In applying the QRLSP provisions to Ms. Murphy and the other recipients, the CRA did not utilize their services.\n[66] The Complainants' submissions regarding s. 7 also fail to take into account the findings of the Federal Court of Appeal decision in a case that I find to be far more relevant and persuasive, Canada (Attorney General) v. Bouvier, 1998 CanLII 7409 (F.C.A.). The complainants in that case were individuals who had been refused employment as brakemen\/yardmen or trainmen by railway companies because they did not meet the visual acuity standards established by federal transportation regulations. They brought human rights complaints against the Department of Transport alleging, among other things, that the Department had indirectly refused to employ them, as prohibited by s. 7 of the CHRA. They argued that the notion of a utilizer of an employee's services should be extended to encompass the Transport Department. Among the grounds cited in support of their argument was the Transport Department's role in the adoption and implementation of the regulations that were the source of the discrimination, as well as the quasi-constitutional status that has been accorded to human rights legislation.\n[67] The Court held, at para. 4, that however compelling these arguments may appear, it is not open for courts and tribunals to redraft the CHRA. Section 7 could not withstand an interpretation that would stretch its meaning to encompass the Transport Department, which is not ultimately responsible for the existence of the regulations and is not entitled to determine their legal effect. The Court went on to state that a Government department cannot be held accountable to the [Canadian Human Rights] Commission for a questionable provision of a Regulation simply because it has been given by Parliament the responsibility of administering the Act on the authority of which the Regulation was validly enacted by the Governor in Council. I note, in passing, that this last statement by the Court accords with the reasoning in Forward and Wignall, discussed earlier.\n[68] The CRA is no more a utilizer of Ms. Murphy's and the other pay equity payment recipients' services than the Transport Department was of the complainants in Bouvier. Section 7's meaning can similarly not be stretched to encompass the CRA's actions in applying the ITA to the employment income received by the pay equity recipients. The CRA's role is, just like the Transport Department, to administer an Act of Parliament (i.e., the ITA) and its validly adopted regulations. Consistent with the Court's finding in Bouvier, I do not see how s. 7 can find any application in the present case.\n[69] The Complainants referred me to a British Columbia decision that found that a refusal by a licensing authority to grant licences to the complainants in that case could engage its liability under the employment-related provision of B.C.'s human rights legislation (Mans v. British Columbia Council of Licensed Practical Nurses [1990] B.C.C.H.R.D. No. 38 (B.C.C.H.R.)(QL), aff'd on other grounds [1993] B.C.J. No. 371 (B.C.C.A.)(QL)). The decision was cited with approval by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal in Bitonti v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia, [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. No. 60 (B.C.H.R.T.)(QL)), although that tribunal ultimately held, at para. 84, that the interpretation of the provision being proposed by the complainant in that case would stretch it beyond what the legislature can have reasonably intended. Just as the Federal Court of Appeal had indicated in Bouvier, the tribunal stated that although human rights legislation is to be interpreted in a broad and purposive manner, this does not permit a re-writing of legislation.\n[70] Mans is a tribunal-level decision that relates to a different legislative provision than the section of the CHRA at issue here, not to mention that it pre-dates the findings in Bouvier, which in my view are far more on point. More importantly, Bouvier is a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal and therefore binding on the Tribunal. I do not consider Mans to be a persuasive authority in this instance.\n[71] For these reasons, I find that the Complainants' allegations in this case, even if believed, cannot engage the liability of the CRA under s. 7(b) of the CHRA, as a matter of statutory interpretation. A prima facie case on the basis of this aspect of the complaint has therefore not been established.\nC. Does the evidence demonstrate that the CRA differentiated adversely in relation to Ms. Murphy and the other recipients of pay equity lump-sum payments on the basis of sex? [72] As I explained earlier, once the QRLSP calculation was performed on Ms. Murphy's tax return, it was shown that the QRLSP provisions of the ITA offered her no tax relief. It was more beneficial for her to use the regular 2000 tax calculation despite the fact that she would be paying income tax at a higher marginal rate than when she was employed in the public service.\n[73] She was not alone among the pay equity lump-sum payment recipients to have found this to be the case. Ms. Barnard testified that the QRLSP calculation was more advantageous to only 7% of all QRLSP claimants in the 2000 tax year, the great majority of whom were pay equity recipients. This data is consistent with the evidence that it is unlikely the QRLSP tax calculation would be beneficial to any recipient of a lump-sum payment (arising from pay equity or any other matter) that relates back beyond six years. The Consent Order provided compensation for lost wages that, depending on how long the claimant had been employed in the affected job, could extend well beyond this period.\n[74] The Complainants argued that Ms. Murphy and the other recipients were effectively compelled to pay tax on the pay equity lump-sum payment using the regular tax calculation in 2000, at higher marginal rates. As a result, they ended up paying a greater portion of their earned income as tax than public service employees performing male dominated work during the years in question.\n[75] In order to demonstrate this adverse differentiation that Ms. Murphy and the other recipients of pay equity lump-sum payments experienced, the Complainants adduced the expert evidence of Gary S. Katz, a chartered accountant with a practice that concentrates on income tax matters. He conducted an analysis of Ms. Murphy's financial and tax information and presented scenarios of what would have happened had Ms. Murphy received the additional wages in the years to which they relate, comparing these results with her actual scenario of receiving the lump-sum payment in 2000.\n[76] Basically, Mr. Katz sought to determine how much better or worse off Ms. Murphy would have been had she received the payments over the years without interest rather than in one lump-sum payment with interest in 2000, which is what the Complainants contend the CRA compelled her to do by rendering the QRLSP provision of no benefit to her.\n[77] Mr. Katz prepared an initial report that he subsequently amended in an addendum to take into account certain comments made by the expert in the area of income taxation whom the CRA called to testify, chartered accountant Martha Skeggs. Mr. Katz considered five possible scenarios:\nWhere Ms. Murphy would have spent 100% of the additional funds in the years in which she received them; Where Ms. Murphy would have immediately invested 100% of the additional funds in 6 month government Treasury Bills (TBills), which Mr. Katz believed would reflect what he perceived as Ms. Murphy's conservative risk profile Where Ms. Murphy would have invested only 15% of the additional funds in 6 month TBills. The remaining 85% was considered to have been spent immediately. Where Ms. Murphy would have immediately invested 100% of the additional funds in a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP), taking into account the maximum amounts she was permitted to invest over the years (i.e., her RRSP room). The assumed investment vehicle was again 6 month TBills. Where Ms. Murphy would have invested only 15% of the additional funds in 6 month TBills within an RRSP. The remaining 85% was considered to have been spent immediately.\n[78] The first three scenarios were compared with Ms. Murphy's actual situation, i.e., where the lump-sum principal and interest payments are taxed in the 2000 return using the regular taxation calculation. The fourth scenario was compared to a hypothetical situation, where Ms. Murphy was assumed to have invested the entire lump-sum principal and interest payments into an RRSP. The evidence in fact is that Ms. Murphy did not deposit any of her lump-sum payments into an RRSP when she received them in 2000. The fifth scenario similarly was compared to the hypothetical situation where 15% of the lump-sum payment in 2000 was invested in an RRSP while the balance was spent.\n[79] Under Scenario #1, where Ms. Murphy is assumed to have spent 100% of the additional funds, Mr. Katz concluded that Ms. Murphy was in fact advantaged by about 10% ($1,507) in receiving the lump-sum payments (including the interest) and being taxed on them in 2000, as opposed to having received the additional funds over the years.\n[80] Under Scenario #2, where Ms. Murphy saves 100% of the additional funds as she earns them over the years, Mr. Katz found that she was disadvantaged by 4% ($533) by receiving the lump-sum payments instead.\n[81] Under Scenario #3, where she saves only 15% of her additional funds, Mr. Katz determined that she was advantaged by 8% ($1,201) in receiving the payments as a lump-sum instead.\n[82] Under Scenario #4, where Ms. Murphy is assumed to have invested all of the additional funds in her RRSP to maximum allowable amounts over the years, Mr. Katz found that she was disadvantaged by 77% ($12,043) in receiving the lump-sum payments in 2000 and hypothetically investing the maximum allowable amount in an RRSP in 2000.\n[83] Finally, under Scenario #5, where only 15% of the additional funds are assumed to have been invested in RRSPs over the years, Mr. Katz concluded that Ms. Murphy would have been financially at par, there being no advantage or disadvantage to her having received the lump-sum payments in 2000.\n[84] Thus, it is only under Scenarios #2 and #4 that Mr. Katz found that Ms. Murphy was disadvantaged in being taxed in 2000 on her lump-sum payments, for which the Complainants hold the CRA responsible for not having enabled her to benefit under the QRLSP provisions.\n[85] This is far from convincing evidence that the QRLSP had an adverse impact on the finances of Ms. Murphy or, for that matter, the other recipients of pay equity lump-sum payments, let alone establish that these consequences constituted adverse differential treatment on the basis of the prohibited ground of sex.\n[86] Nevertheless, even if I were to accept that the evidence establishes prima facie that Ms. Murphy and the other pay equity recipients were adversely impacted financially by the application of the QRLSP mechanism, albeit in only two of the five scenarios, I find that the CRA has satisfactorily refuted this evidence.\nD. What is the CRA's evidence in response to the Complainant's expert evidence? [87] The CRA contends that both of the scenarios (#2 and #4) where Mr. Katz found a disadvantage are suspect. Ms. Skeggs testified that after analyzing Mr. Katz's report, she concluded that both scenarios should be assigned very little weight having found neither of them to be realistic.\n[88] Both scenarios assumed that Ms. Murphy would have saved 100% of the additional funds (inside or outside an RRSP). Ms. Skeggs and the CRA noted the following problems with this assumption:\nCanadians are saving less and less. Ms. Skeggs produced information derived from Statistics Canada indicating that savings rates have declined over the period affected by the pay equity settlement (1985-1999). During the early 1980's personal savings as a percentage of personal disposable income were in the 15% range, but by the early 1990's personal savings were around 9% and dropped to about 5% by 2001. She concluded therefore that a 100% savings rate is likely unrealistic. It was on account of her evidence in this regard that Mr. Katz adjusted his initial report and included scenarios that considered a 15% savings rate (Scenarios #3 and #5). He found that Ms. Murphy was not disadvantaged by the lump-sum payments in these scenarios. Ms. Murphy's actual history does not indicate a significant level of saving while employed in the federal public service. Ms. Murphy reported investment or interest income in only one of the relevant years ($111 in 1990); Prior to 1991, Ms. Murphy did not make any RRSP contribution while employed with the federal public service. As a public servant, she was contributing 5-6% of her earnings to the government's registered pension plan. According to Statistics Canada data referred to by Ms. Skeggs, this pattern of contribution was consistent with the average contributions into pension plans and RRSPs for women in the same earnings quintile as Ms. Murphy over this period. It would therefore be reasonable to assume that no further RRSP contributions would have been made by her. It was only once she changed employer and began earning a significantly higher income that Ms. Murphy began investing more extensively in her RRSPs, at close to the maximum available amounts. It would be unreasonable to assume that she would have contributed 100% of the incremental additional earnings to an RRSP, which would have been inconsistent with her pattern of contributions prior to 1991. It is noteworthy that she did not contribute any of the lump-sum payment to her RRSP in 2000. The additional pay equity sums when distributed out over the ten years to which they relate are all relatively small, some as low as $39 and $74 per annum. Five are between $1,107 and $1,786 ($21 to $34 per week), and the highest is $3,247 (for the year 1989). Thus, even the largest annual amount would have resulted in a little over $62 more per week. With sums in these amounts, it is unlikely that a person would save 100% of the additional increments with every pay cheque. Ms. Murphy testified that she might have been able to pay a little bit more on her mortgage payments at the time, had she been receiving the extra wages, although in the 1980's, saving more money would have been difficult because of the expenses associated with raising her teenage children. Mr. Katz's analysis did not take into account the tax effect of the RRSP contributions. At some point, typically upon retirement, RRSP amounts are withdrawn at which time they are taxed as income. Mr. Katz conceded that this tax effect was not factored into his calculations. The disadvantage given in his report with respect to Scenario #4 would thus be reduced significantly, depending on what Ms. Murphy's marginal tax rate would be when she collapses the RRSP. Ms. Skeggs calculated the effect if Ms. Murphy cashed out her RRSP in 2000, at the highest marginal rate applicable in her province (46%). The results showed that Ms. Murphy would have been appreciably advantaged (by 22%) in receiving the pay equity payments as lump-sums in 2000. While few people typically collapse their RRSPs when earning income that is taxed at the highest marginal rate, this result suggests that even if factoring in a tax effect on the RRSPs at a lower marginal rate, the lump-sum payments would yield a considerably lower disadvantage, if not actually an advantage, than as presented by Mr. Katz in his evidence.\n[89] I find these arguments persuasive. It is highly improbable that Ms. Murphy or any Canadian in her circumstances at the relevant time would have saved 100% of the additional incremental sums. The failure to factor in the tax effect with respect to the 100% RRSP scenario significantly calls into question any findings related thereto as well. Neither of the two allegedly adverse scenarios (#2 and #4) is realistic.\n[90] The Complainants assert that the case is not only based on Ms. Murphy's financial information. Mr. Katz's report analyzed the situation of another public servant who received a pay equity lump-sum payment. However, that person did not testify with regard to the data upon which the report was based. Moreover, Mr. Katz's testimony barely touched upon that person's scenarios. In addition, while Mr. Katz filed an addendum to his original report in order to make several corrections to his methodology and calculations, those adjustments were made only with respect to Ms. Murphy. He did not apply any of the changes to the other person. Consequently, the oversights and flaws in the original report that were corrected in the addendum remain untouched with respect to the other individual. Those conclusions are therefore unreliable.\n[91] Besides, Mr. Katz testified that had he adjusted the calculations with respect to the other person as he had done regarding Ms. Murphy, the numbers would have gone down but he was confident that his conclusions would still be the same regarding advantageousness of the lump-sum payment, not unlike that which had occurred with respect to Ms. Murphy's figures. I have determined, however, that those findings regarding Ms. Murphy's two disadvantageous scenarios are not persuasive and I am therefore not convinced, particularly with the limited evidence before me, that the results with respect to the other individual would be any more persuasive.\n[92] Thus, it has not been established on a balance of probabilities that Ms. Murphy or any other pay equity recipient experienced adverse treatment as a result of receiving their payments in the form of a lump-sum, let alone that they had been differentiated in this alleged treatment on the basis of the prohibited ground of sex.\n[93] One likely reason for this outcome was explained by Ms. Skeggs in her testimony. She pointed out that pursuant to the Consent Order, all of the recipients were entitled to interest on the sums owing to them. The interest rates agreed to by the PSAC and the Treasury Board (effectively 90% of the rates that had been originally set in the Tribunal decision - ranging from 3.5% (1998) to as high as 11.25% (1985)) far exceeded the rate of inflation over the same period (between 1.65% and 2.8%).\n[94] Thus, for instance in Scenario #1 (the 100% spend scenario), if one were only to look at the principal without the interest, Ms. Murphy would obviously have been better off receiving her additional funds in increments over the years, when her total income was less and was therefore paying income tax at lower marginal rates, than in 2000 when her income was much higher. The disadvantage would have been $3,510 in 2000 dollars (i.e., after factoring in for inflation). However, the interest lump-sum payment that Ms. Murphy received in 2000, net of income tax, was over $5,000. The interest ensured that she would be better off receiving her compensation as a lump-sum payment in 2000, rather than having received it incrementally over the years.\n[95] The Commission and the Complainants argued that the award of interest is irrelevant to the issues of this case. It is a distinct and separate remedy that cannot be considered in determining if a tax assessment is discriminatory.\n[96] I do not agree. The issue at this stage of the analysis consists of ascertaining, with the assistance of expert evidence, whether Ms. Murphy would have been better off receiving her wages incrementally over the years or, on the other hand, as a lump-sum compensation package in 2000. In order to properly conduct this analysis, one cannot disregard the fact that interest was added to her wages when she received them as a lump-sum in 2000.\n[97] The interest that formed part of the settlement agreement between the PSAC and the Treasury Board was calculated as a proportion of the Canada Savings Bond rates ordered by the Tribunal in its 1998 decision. The Tribunal, at para. 477, referred to an excerpt from Canada (Attorney General) v. Morgan, [1992] 2 F.C. 401 (F.C.A.), in which the Court stated that interest is meant to cover the loss. If the exercise we are engaged in consists of assessing whether the complainant has been disadvantaged by having been compensated in the form of lump-sum payments, we cannot simply ignore the interest portion of that compensation that Ms. Murphy actually received, which was after all intended to cover the loss occasioned by the wage discrimination. If her loss has been more than entirely covered by the interest (in Ms. Murphy's case, by an excess of over $1,500), how can she assert that she has been disadvantaged? It just does not make any sense.\n[98] Besides, this issue raises an area of the Complainants' case that I have some measure of difficulty accepting. It relates to the fact that the lump-sum payments, including the interest, were awarded to Ms. Murphy and the other recipients as a result of a negotiated settlement of the Section 11 Complaints proceedings.\nE. Is this complaint an effort to avoid the normal and anticipated consequences of the settlement? [99] The CRA argued vigorously that this complaint was an attempt by the Complainants to, in effect, avoid the normal and anticipated consequences of the settlement agreement and Consent Order in an attempt to retroactively address the tax treatment of the pay equity settlement lump-sum payments. While I am not convinced, as the CRA contends, that this constitutes an abuse of process, I share the CRA's overall perception of the complaint. Given my earlier findings that the complaint has not been substantiated, my comments in this respect need only take the form of an observation.\n[100] In October 29, 1999, the PSAC and the Treasury Board negotiated and signed a Memorandum of Agreement for the purpose of implementing the decision of the Human Rights Tribunal dated July 29, 1998. The settlement was presented to the Tribunal on November 16, 1999. The Tribunal granted the parties the consent order they were seeking, in which it was noted that the parties had advised the Tribunal that matters relating to the various phases of the proceedings had been resolved as a result of the agreement.\n[101] As the CRA points out, at all material times including when the settlement was negotiated and signed, the ITA provided that lump-sum amounts like the ones being paid under the settlement would be taxed in the year in which they would be received (s. 5(1) of the ITA). According to Ms. Jaekl, the PSAC is one of Canada's largest unions with offices nationwide and staff lawyers. The union has been involved in numerous lawsuits and settlements related to employment, pay equity and human rights. It had sought and obtained verification of this tax information from Revenue Canada over a year earlier, before the Tribunal decision had even been issued. This is the tax rule that was ultimately applied to Ms. Murphy's lump-sum payments. This tax consequence was thus neither unforeseen nor unforeseeable.\n[102] Ms. Jaekl indicated in her evidence that the Treasury Board had placed a lot of pressure on the PSAC to settle in that week of November 1999, following the release of the Federal Court's judgment. I am not certain if she intended to imply that the PSAC had been coerced into signing the settlement agreement and that it should therefore not be bound by all the consequential effects of the agreement. Given the above-described sophistication of the PSAC and the fact that these negotiations were occurring following a Federal Court judgment in its favour, I would find such an argument to be very questionable to say the least. In any event, the appropriate place to have raised this type of submission would have been before the Tribunal that heard the parties to the agreement and issued the Consent Order, rather than the Tribunal hearing the present complaint against the CRA.\n[103] As the CRA also indicated in its submissions, the PSAC should similarly not have been surprised by the fact that the QRLSP mechanism was of limited benefit to its members. At the time of the settlement, the QRLSP provision had already been announced in the February 1999 Budget Plan and had been included in a bill before Parliament. The provision as ultimately enacted was identical in all material respects to what had been proposed in the 1999 Budget Plan, including the fact that the notional tax calculated under the provision includes an interest component calculated at the prescribed refund interest rate. Since 1989, the ITA has provided that the method for calculating interest is compounding.\n[104] The CRA correctly points out that it is normal practice for parties to seek to mitigate the tax impact of awards when making submissions on remedy before the Tribunal. For example, the Tribunal may order that the tax impact on complainants be addressed by a gross up of the award (Green v. Canada (Public Service Commission), 2003 CHRT 34 at para. 7; Cashin v Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1990 CanLII 650 (C.H.R.T.)). Parties regularly discuss tax implications during mediation and other forms of settlement talks and often a resolution regarding these implications is incorporated in the terms of the settlement.\n[105] The settlement that the PSAC reached with the Treasury Board expressly referred to the tax impact on the settlement monies. Clause 12 stipulated that the parties jointly undertook to provide timely information to employees with respect to the tax implications related to the lump-sum payments.\n[106] Thus, the CRA submits that given the wording of the settlement, the fact that the PSAC had specifically sought and received answers from Revenue Canada about the tax implications of lump-sum payments, and in light of its sophistication as a litigant, the PSAC must be taken as having accepted the tax treatment of the lump-sum payments it negotiated. Either the issue was raised and addressed during negotiation, or the PSAC should have raised the issue.\n[107] I agree. The settlement agreement between the PSAC and the Treasury Board was in full and final satisfaction of the recipients' pay equity claim. As a settlement, it must have involved negotiation and compromise. Ms. Jaekl testified that although the PSAC had won at both the Tribunal and Federal Court levels, it had an interest in resolving the issue promptly for the benefit of its members, particularly since the Treasury Board had indicated its intention to appeal if no agreement was reached. Nonetheless, if the PSAC believed that the tax treatment of the lump-sum payments would negatively impact the pay equity recipients, it could have refused those terms or negotiated another form of settlement with different tax consequences.\n[108] The Tax Court of Canada reached a similar conclusion in the case of Burrows v. The Queen, 2005 TCC 761. In that case, the complainant appealed the assessment of income tax on the interest portion of her lump-sum pay equity payments. She argued that the imposition of tax on the pre-judgment interest was discriminatory under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court dismissed her claim for want of jurisdiction but went on to add, at para. 47, that since both parties to the settlement agreement knew that pre-judgment interest is taxable under the Act, it was open to them to negotiate another form of settlement, such as damages. Having agreed to a settlement including pre-judgment interest, the PSAC must be taken to have accepted the fact that such interest was taxable under the ITA.\n[109] Similarly, the PSAC must be taken to have accepted the fact that the lump-sum pay equity payments would be taxed in the year in which they would be received and that if the QRLSP mechanism was to eventually be incorporated into the ITA, the scope of its benefit would be limited.\nF. The basic premise for the complaint [110] Finally, I wish to address what I surmise to be the basic premise of the present complaint. The Complainants argued that conceptions of equality must be built into all contexts of society, and not limited to specific areas of activity, like employment. They claim that because the QRLSP mechanism resulted in pay equity recipients paying a higher overall percentage of their income as tax, these individuals suffered a discriminatory impact. The CRA was obliged, the Complainants contend, to take action and modify the QRLSP provision's effect by waiving or lowering the compound interest rate or taking some other measure to eliminate this impact.\n[111] I have already found that the alleged adverse financial impact of the QRLSP has not been established. However, even if it had been established that Ms. Murphy and the other recipients had been disadvantaged, the Complainants' argument cannot be supported. It is essentially the same argument that was presented and dismissed in Sveinson v. Canada (Attorney General), 2003 FCA 259 at paras. 15-7. The Complainant in that case was also a pay equity payment recipient. She claimed that the pay equity payment should have been allocated for employment insurance purposes to her earnings in the years in respect of which the payment was paid rather than in the year in which the lump sum payment was paid. The parallels to the present case are obvious.\n[112] The complainant in that case argued that the provision of the Employment Insurance Regulation, SOR\/96-332, in question should have been interpreted in a manner that varied from its clear statutory language because a failure to do so undermined the purpose of the CHRA, namely, to put those who had been unlawfully underpaid in the same financial position in which they would have been if the Government had not breached s. 11 of the CHRA. The Federal Court of Appeal found that this argument amounted, in effect, to a claim that legislation that does not rectify all the indirect consequences of unlawful discrimination by an employer would itself be inconsistent with the CHRA. In rejecting the argument, the Court stated that this is not the kind of inconsistency that requires otherwise valid legislation to be rendered inoperative.\n[113] In a similar fashion, the Complainants are alleging that the ITA's QRLSP provision does not rectify the indirect consequence of Ms. Murphy being taxed at higher marginal rates because she received her wages in the form of lump-sum pay equity payments. In keeping with the Court's reasoning in Sveinson, however, I would also find that the QRLSP mechanism's failure to rectify this alleged discrimination does not constitute the kind of inconsistency that would require the CRA to take measures to have that the interest portion of the QRLSP calculation be rendered inoperative.\nVIII. Conclusion [114] For all these reasons, I find that the complaint has not been substantiated.\nSigned by Athanasios D.

LA PLAINTE [1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision portant sur la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Wayne Douglas, \u00e0 titre de plaignant, contre SLH Transport Inc. (SLH), \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9e, en date du 11 juillet 2007. Le plaignant soutient que SLH a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison d'une d\u00e9ficience physique, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[2] Sur le fondement de l'alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi), la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission), dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 ao\u00fbt 2008, a demand\u00e9 au pr\u00e9sent Tribunal d'instruire la plainte.\n[3] La Commission n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience.\nII. L'ARTICLE 7 DE LA LOI [4] Le plaignant cite l'alin\u00e9a a) de l'article susmentionn\u00e9 de la Loi comme pratique discriminatoire \u00e0 laquelle l'intim\u00e9e aurait eu recours en raison de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Douglas. Cette disposition est libell\u00e9e comme suit :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\na) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu;\nLe motif de distinction illicite que d\u00e9nonce la plainte est la d\u00e9ficience, mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 3(1) de la Loi.\nIII. LES FAITS [5] Wayne Douglas a 37 ans. Il a d\u00e9but\u00e9 son emploi au sein de SLH le 21 septembre 1998 comme chauffeur de camion \u00e0 temps partiel. Environ six mois plus tard, il est devenu employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein de SLH. Il a 10 ans de scolarit\u00e9. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par SLH le 11 mai 2007 alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e0 long terme en attente d'une chirurgie pour son genou droit.\n[6] Pendant sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 titre de chauffeur de camion au sein de SLH, M. Douglas a toujours travaill\u00e9 durant le quart de nuit sur le parcours de distribution, lequel commen\u00e7ait au terminal de SLH \u00e0 Bedford, au nord d'Halifax, et s'\u00e9tendait tout le long de la rive sud de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, \u00e0 l'ouest de Bedford. Ce parcours comprend environ 700 kilom\u00e8tres en tout et le chauffeur doit s'arr\u00eater \u00e0 12 magasins ou d\u00e9p\u00f4ts de catalogues Sears, de Bedford Ouest jusqu'\u00e0 Yarmouth et vice versa, pour livrer des biens command\u00e9s \u00e0 partir du catalogue Sears, des articles l\u00e9gers tels que des v\u00eatements, des bijoux et de la literie, ainsi que des articles plus lourds de prix unitaire \u00e9lev\u00e9s tels que des souffleuses \u00e0 neige, des fours, des laveuses, des tracteurs \u00e0 gazon et de grandes quantit\u00e9s d'isolation emball\u00e9es sous film r\u00e9tractable et plac\u00e9es sur des palettes. Le camion est constitu\u00e9 d'une cabine non couchette \u00e0 deux places, \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de laquelle est attel\u00e9e une remorque qui mesure environ 50 pieds.\n[7] Une \u00e9quipe de deux employ\u00e9s travaille sur un parcours de distribution donn\u00e9 : le chauffeur principal et un assistant qui peut aussi conduire. Le chauffeur et son assistant d\u00e9chargent les biens \u00e0 chacun des magasins ou des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts et reprennent les biens retourn\u00e9s. Certains des magasins ou d\u00e9p\u00f4ts ont des plateformes de chargement o\u00f9 la remorque peut \u00eatre recul\u00e9e jusqu'au palier de la plateforme. D'autres n'ont pas de plateforme de chargement et une rampe transport\u00e9e dans la remorque doit \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9charger et de charger les biens. Comme beaucoup des biens sont lourds, les camions sont munis de deux diables et, parfois, selon la charge du camion, d'un v\u00e9rin hydraulique pour d\u00e9placer les biens qui se trouvent sur des palettes.\n[8] Il y a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement quatre parcours de distribution de nuit et un parcours de distribution de jour \u00e0 partir du terminal de Bedford. Le chargement et le d\u00e9chargement des remorques au terminal est effectu\u00e9 par des d\u00e9bardeurs. Le chauffeur se rend au terminal environ une demi-heure avant de commencer son parcours afin de remplir les papiers n\u00e9cessaires et d'examiner le camion avant le d\u00e9part, en v\u00e9rifiant par exemple les fluides, les lumi\u00e8res, les ceintures, les durites, les pneus et les freins. Il att\u00e8le ensuite le camion \u00e0 la remorque et d\u00e9bute son parcours. Lorsqu'il retourne au terminal \u00e0 la fin de son parcours, il recule son camion \u00e0 la plateforme, d\u00e9tache la remorque et conduit ensuite le camion jusqu'au distributeur de carburant, il fait le plein d'essence et il stationne le camion.\n[9] Le terminal de SLH \u00e0 Bedford est l'un des deux terminaux de la compagnie dans les Maritimes - l'autre terminal se trouve \u00e0 Moncton, au Nouveau-Brunswick. Le terminal de Bedford compte environ 40 employ\u00e9s, y compris six m\u00e9caniciens, trois d\u00e9bardeurs \u00e0 temps plein, un directeur d'exploitation, un directeur r\u00e9gional, un commis comptable, un directeur de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, un vendeur, un chauffeur-entra\u00eeneur, deux r\u00e9partiteurs et demi, cinq \u00e9quipes de chauffeurs de parcours de distribution constitu\u00e9es de deux chauffeurs par \u00e9quipe, deux chauffeurs \u00e0 temps partiel et six chauffeurs de transport de ligne pour les quarts de jour et de nuit.\n[10] Le si\u00e8ge social de SLH est \u00e0 Kingston, en Ontario. SLH emploie environ 1 000 personnes au Canada. En 2006, SLH a connu sa deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e en importance du point de vue des profits. En 2007, SLH a connu sa meilleure ann\u00e9e. En 2008, elle a eu une ann\u00e9e presque aussi bonne qu'en 2007, cependant, apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9t\u00e9, le commerce a chut\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante. En 2007, il y avait environ 30 employ\u00e9s de plus qu'il n'y a aujourd'hui aux terminaux de Bedford et de Moncton, car la r\u00e9cession r\u00e9cente a affect\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement le commerce de SLH. Depuis l'automne 2008, le commerce a chut\u00e9 et SLH ne manque plus de chauffeurs de camion. En 2009, au jour de l'audience, le volume d'activit\u00e9s de l'entreprise est de 30 p. 100 inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la moyenne.\n[11] M. Douglas \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de 15 heures de temps pay\u00e9 pour son parcours de distribution (le parcours le long de la rive sud). Si un chauffeur est capable de terminer son parcours en moins des 15 heures pr\u00e9vues, il re\u00e7oit tout de m\u00eame le salaire complet. La plupart du temps, le chauffeur est en mesure de terminer son parcours en environ 10 \u00e0 12 heures, incluant deux \u00e0 trois heures pass\u00e9es au chargement et au d\u00e9chargement des biens, alors que le reste du temps est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire. Un chauffeur n'est jamais pay\u00e9 pour les jours o\u00f9 il ne travaille pas et il est seulement pay\u00e9 pour le temps pr\u00e9vu pour effectuer son parcours ainsi que pour le temps suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u00e9cessaire. La plupart du temps, M. Douglas conduisait trois nuits par semaine, mais chaque ann\u00e9e, \u00e0 l'approche de No\u00ebl, la demande \u00e9tait plus forte et il conduisait quatre nuits par semaine et m\u00eame parfois cinq nuits par semaine.\n[12] Les remorques sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement toujours remplies presque jusqu'\u00e0 la porte arri\u00e8re, avec une garde au toit suffisante pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ainsi qu'un petit espace dans le coin droit arri\u00e8re de la remorque pour permettre au chauffeur et \u00e0 son assistant d'entrer dans la remorque pour la d\u00e9charger. Un pourcentage important (de 50 \u00e0 75 p. 100) des biens livr\u00e9s et ramass\u00e9s sur un parcours de distribution p\u00e8sent plus de 100 livres et le travail de chauffeur de parcours de distribution comprend le fait de lever des articles lourds de prix unitaire \u00e9lev\u00e9. Les diables et le v\u00e9rin hydraulique qui sont rang\u00e9s dans la remorque aident, mais le transport d'articles de poids lourd et le manuvrage n\u00e9cessaire pour lever, pousser et tirer les articles de plus de 100 livres sont un aspect principal du travail de distribution et constituent environ 60 p. 100 du temps de chargement et de d\u00e9chargement pour le chauffeur et son assistant.\n[13] M. Douglas occupe pr\u00e9sentement un emploi au sein de la Compagnie de la baie d'Hudson (HBC) comme chauffeur de camion. Il a commenc\u00e9 cet emploi au d\u00e9but avril 2009. Cet emploi chez HBC est un travail purement de transport \u00e0 destination qui comporte la conduite d'un camion semblable \u00e0 celui qu'il conduisait lorsqu'il travaillait pour SLH. Il conduit maintenant cinq nuits par semaine \u00e0 partir du terminal de HBC \u00e0 Dartmouth (Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse) jusqu'\u00e0 Moncton (Nouveau-Brunswick) ou \u00e0 Lincoln (Nouveau-Brunswick) et vice versa. Lors d'un transport \u00e0 destination pour HBC, il n'y a qu'un seul chauffeur et aucun assistant. M. Douglas doit atteler la remorque, lever et descendre les b\u00e9quilles et v\u00e9rifier sous le capot et sous le camion en guise d'examen avant le d\u00e9part. Cependant, son emploi chez HBC ne comprend que du transport \u00e0 destination ou du transport d'origine \u00e0 destination. Il n'a pas \u00e0 charger ou \u00e0 d\u00e9charger le camion ni \u00e0 soulever les articles qu'il transporte.\n[14] L'activit\u00e9 principale de SLH depuis son ouverture en 1989 est le transport sur un parcours de distribution pour les magasins Sears. SLH effectue maintenant du transport commercial (TC) par camion qui n'est pas de la distribution. Pour le TC, SLH transporte des articles pour un client en faisant diff\u00e9rents arr\u00eats. Cela s'effectue principalement par transport de jour sur de courtes distances. Pour le TC, le chauffeur doit presque toujours charger et d\u00e9charger le camion en levant des articles lourds environ 10 \u00e0 20 p. 100 du temps (par opposition aux parcours de distribution, lors desquels il faut lever des articles lourds environ 60 p. 100 du temps). En de rares occasions, SLH peut avoir un transport \u00e0 destination, sans chargement ou d\u00e9chargement d'articles lourds pour un court TC de jour, mais cela est peu fr\u00e9quent et ne constitue pas suffisamment de travail pour cr\u00e9er un poste \u00e0 temps plein, en particulier en raison du climat \u00e9conomique actuel. Il est peu probable que pr\u00e9sentement, SLH soit en mesure de cr\u00e9er un poste de chauffeur de camion qui ne comprendrait aucun chargement lourd, puisqu'il n'y a pas suffisamment de volume pour g\u00e9n\u00e9rer un poste \u00e0 temps plein pour qui que ce soit dans cette cat\u00e9gorie sans r\u00e9duire le nombre d'heures pour le reste des chauffeurs de camion \u00e0 des niveaux inacceptables.\n[15] Le gouvernement de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a r\u00e9cemment lanc\u00e9 un nouveau projet pilote connu sous le nom de programme d'ensemble routier long (LCV) qui est pr\u00e9sentement test\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de programme environnemental visant \u00e0 r\u00e9duire les gaz \u00e0 effet de serre en utilisant des tracteurs de remorques constitu\u00e9s de quatre parties. Il y a d'abord la cabine, puis une remorque de 53 pieds ainsi qu'un convertisseur qui att\u00e8le la premi\u00e8re remorque de 53 pieds \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re ou \u00e0 une deuxi\u00e8me remorque de 53 pieds. SLH a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e pour participer au projet pilote, mais elle n'a pas encore re\u00e7u l'approbation finale pour commencer le projet. Les v\u00e9hicules pour ce programme ne peuvent rouler que sur des autoroutes divis\u00e9es. Le parcours que SLH souhaite utiliser, si elle obtient l'approbation finale pour le programme, est la route dite du courrier (ce n'est pas un vrai itin\u00e9raire de distribution de courrier) qui existe pr\u00e9sentement entre Bedford (Halifax) et Moncton. Il s'agit principalement d'un transport \u00e0 destination pour des marchandises de catalogue, mais il ne s'agit pas purement d'un transport \u00e0 destination puisqu'il comprend tout de m\u00eame du chargement, du d\u00e9chargement et du transport d'articles lourds. Trois employ\u00e9s de SLH ont \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de formation \u00e0 Calgary pour effectuer du transport en LCV.\n[16] M. Douglas a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal \u00e0 l'appui de sa plainte. Il a reconnu que SLH \u00e9tait un bon employeur. SLH poss\u00e8de un programme de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en milieu de travail, un programme d'information et de formation sur la conduite, y compris le traitement des mati\u00e8res dangereuses, une politique de pr\u00e9vention de l'abus d'alcool et des drogues ainsi qu'un programme d'aide aux employ\u00e9s (PAE). SLH n'a pas de politique pr\u00e9cise sur la discrimination en milieu de travail qui donne aux employ\u00e9s des renseignements au sujet des lois et des pratiques en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[17] \u00c0 l'automne 2006, M. Douglas a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir de la douleur et de l'inconfort au genou droit. Il a ressenti une perte de stabilit\u00e9 et un contr\u00f4le diminu\u00e9 de ses pas lorsqu'il montait ou descendait les rampes pour charger ou d\u00e9charger la remorque pendant ses quarts de travail. Son genou lui donnait l'impression qu'il allait l\u00e2cher. Il ressentait aussi de l'inconfort lorsqu'il \u00e9tait assis et qu'il conduisait. Il n'a pas mentionn\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes avec son genou droit \u00e0 son employeur avant le 17 novembre 2006, auquel moment il a avis\u00e9 son patron, M. Clyde Smith, le directeur r\u00e9gional de SLH dans les Maritimes, qu'il allait \u00eatre absent du travail pendant quelques semaines en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de genou. Il a dit \u00e0 M. Smith que la blessure n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e au travail. Selon M. Douglas, il boitait d\u00e9j\u00e0 depuis un certain temps avant le 17 novembre 2006 et certains de ses coll\u00e8gues auraient remarqu\u00e9 son \u00e9tat. D'apr\u00e8s M. Smith, cependant, l'\u00e9tat du genou droit de M. Douglas n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 l'attention de la gestion de SLH avant le 17 novembre 2006.\n[18] Le 20 novembre 2006, M. Douglas a consult\u00e9 la Dre Leckey, qui l'a envoy\u00e9 passer des rayons-X et qui l'a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 au Dr Stalker, un m\u00e9decin du sport \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 Dalhousie, pour examiner les rayons-X. Il a obtenu un certificat m\u00e9dical de la Dre Leckey dat\u00e9 du 27 novembre 2006 sur lequel il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit que M. Douglas serait absent du travail ind\u00e9finiment en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes avec son genou droit. Il a donn\u00e9 le certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e0 M. Smith le 27 novembre. M. Smith lui a dit de prendre soin de son genou, de remplir tous les formulaires requis et de le tenir avis\u00e9 de ses progr\u00e8s. Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2006, M. Douglas a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Stalker, qui \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas aurait probablement besoin d'une chirurgie au genou. Le Dr Stalker a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 M. Douglas au Dr Gross, un chirurgien orthop\u00e9diste. Le 11 janvier 2007, M. Douglas a rencontr\u00e9 le Dr Gross, qui lui a dit qu'il avait besoin d'une chirurgie en raison d'une d\u00e9chirure du m\u00e9nisque interne et d'un kyste \u00e0 son genou droit. Le Dr Gross a indiqu\u00e9 que la chirurgie aurait lieu dans environ six mois. M. Douglas a avis\u00e9 M. Smith de ce fait apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec le Dr Gross.\n[19] M. Douglas avait un historique d'absences pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales avant cette absence pour son genou droit. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 pour stress psychologique aigu du 21 juin jusqu'au 1er septembre 2001. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 du 11 mars 2002 jusqu'au 19 ao\u00fbt 2003 en raison d'une chirurgie \u00e0 son genou gauche. Lors de ces deux occasions, M. Douglas a re\u00e7u des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e (ICD) et d'invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e (ILD) de la Financi\u00e8re Sun Life (Sun Life) en vertu du programme d'avantages de SLH. M. Douglas a rempli tous les formulaires n\u00e9cessaires afin de recevoir ses indemnit\u00e9s avec l'aide de sa conjointe Lisa Gillis, y compris la pr\u00e9sentation de tous les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux n\u00e9cessaires. Dans les deux cas, son emploi lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 garanti et on a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 payer ses avantages sociaux. \u00c0 son retour apr\u00e8s ces deux cong\u00e9s, SLH lui a rendu son emploi \u00e0 titre de chauffeur de camion sur les parcours de distribution sans restreindre ses t\u00e2ches.\n[20] Avec l'aide de Lisa Gillis, M. Douglas a rempli les formulaires n\u00e9cessaires et on lui a accord\u00e9 des prestations d'ICD jusqu'au 23 mars 2007 pour ses probl\u00e8mes de genou droit apr\u00e8s la tenue d'une \u00e9valuation. Il a mentionn\u00e9 sur les formulaires que sa blessure n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e au travail. Comme les prestations d'ICD sont offertes pour environ 17 semaines, il a rempli, encore une fois avec l'aide de Lisa Gillis, les formulaires n\u00e9cessaires pour effectuer la transition des prestations d'ICD aux prestations d'ILD. Sun Life a approuv\u00e9 pour M. Douglas des prestations d'ILD jusqu'au 23 mars 2009 et SLH a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e de ce fait.\n[21] M. Douglas a rempli tous les formulaires pour Sun Life au sujet de l'\u00e9tat de son genou droit de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'il avait rempli les formulaires au sujet de ses probl\u00e8mes au genou gauche plusieurs ann\u00e9es auparavant. Entre novembre 2006 et le d\u00e9but avril 2007, SLH n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Douglas des renseignements au sujet de sa sant\u00e9 sauf en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une lettre de Sue Reid, l'administratrice du service de la paye et des avantages sociaux de SLH en f\u00e9vrier 2007, qui rappelait \u00e0 M. Douglas de remplir les formulaires de transition de Sun Life pour pouvoir obtenir des prestations d'ILD apr\u00e8s le 23 mars et en ce qui a trait aux demandes de M. Smith en novembre 2006 et en janvier 2007 que M. Douglas le tienne au courant de l'\u00e9volution de ses probl\u00e8mes de genou. Pendant la p\u00e9riode durant laquelle M. Douglas \u00e9tait employ\u00e9 par SLH et ne travaillait pas parce qu'il \u00e9tait en ILD, SLH a continu\u00e9 de payer sa part des primes de couverture d'assurance Sun Life en plus de la part de M. Douglas parce qu'il ne recevait pas de salaire, mais SLH s'attendait \u00e0 ce que M. Douglas lui rembourse sa part des primes de couverture d'assurance. Il a souvent rembours\u00e9 ses primes en retard \u00e0 SLH.\n[22] En janvier 2007, M. Smith a re\u00e7u la visite d'Ed Dugas, un employ\u00e9 du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui \u00e9tait responsable des questions de respect du Code canadien du travail dans la r\u00e9gion. Pendant cette visite, M. Smith a discut\u00e9 de la situation de M. Douglas avec M. Dugas. M. Smith souhaitait savoir quelle \u00e9tait son obligation, en vertu du Code canadien du travail, de conserver le poste de M. Douglas dans le cas o\u00f9 celui-ci serait en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical prolong\u00e9. M. Dugas a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 M. Smith qu'en vertu du Code canadien du travail, il n'avait qu'\u00e0 garder le poste ouvert pendant 12 semaines \u00e0 partir de la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical. Il lui a aussi dit qu'aucune prestation de d\u00e9part n'aurait \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Douglas si celui-ci \u00e9tait cong\u00e9di\u00e9. M. Douglas a dit \u00e0 M. Smith qu'il devrait communiquer avec M. Douglas pour avoir une mise \u00e0 jour au sujet de son \u00e9tat et pour savoir \u00e0 quel moment il pourrait revenir au travail.\n[23] Vers la fin avril 2007, M. Douglas s'est rendu au terminal de Bedford pour rembourser \u00e0 SLH certaines primes de couverture d'assurance. Alors qu'il s'y trouvait, M. Bill Oakley, le directeur des op\u00e9rations de SLH, lui a demand\u00e9 de signer un formulaire pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par M. Smith dans lequel se trouvaient un certain nombre de questions portant sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. M. Douglas ne croyait pas que ce formulaire avait une grande importance. Il n'avait jamais vu le formulaire auparavant, alors que selon M. Smith et Mme Reid, le formulaire lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par courrier recommand\u00e9 mais n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 ramass\u00e9. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oakley s'il devait demander de l'aide \u00e0 un m\u00e9decin ou \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions. M. Oakley ne lui a pas dit qu'il avait besoin de l'aide de quelqu'un d'autre pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions.\n[24] M. Douglas a rempli le formulaire alors qu'il se trouvait au terminal ce jour l\u00e0. L'une des questions qu'on lui demandait visait \u00e0 savoir, si sa chirurgie n'avait pas encore eu lieu, s'il connaissait la date pr\u00e9vue de chirurgie. Il a r\u00e9pondu que la chirurgie \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue dans les six mois \u00e0 un an \u00e0 partir de la date \u00e0 laquelle il a rempli le formulaire, mais \u00e0 une autre question, il a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'avait pas encore de date de chirurgie. On lui a aussi demand\u00e9 quel serait l'estim\u00e9 raisonnable d'une date pr\u00e9vue de retour au travail. M. Douglas a aussi r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette question que la date serait de six mois \u00e0 un an. Le formulaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 suite aux conseils que M. Dugas avait donn\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Smith en janvier. M. Smith n'avait jamais pr\u00e9par\u00e9 de formulaire de ce genre pour un autre employ\u00e9 qui \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Tr\u00e8s r\u00e9cemment, selon M. Smith, des formulaires de ce genre ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s pour des employ\u00e9s en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical.\n[25] D'apr\u00e8s M. Smith, lorsqu'il a examin\u00e9 les r\u00e9ponses de M. Douglas sur le formulaire, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu que l'absence de M. Douglas d\u00e9passerait un an et m\u00eame un an et demi, comme son absence pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente pour chirurgie \u00e0 son genou gauche. Il \u00e9tait d'avis que les r\u00e9ponses de M. Douglas \u00e9taient insatisfaisantes, parce qu'il n'avait pas de date pr\u00e9vue de chirurgie et que les p\u00e9riodes donn\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse aux deux questions susmentionn\u00e9es \u00e9taient les m\u00eames et ne comptaient pas de temps pour la convalescence apr\u00e8s la chirurgie, qui avait pris six mois lorsque M. Douglas avait subi sa chirurgie pour son genou gauche.\n[26] M. Smith a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait besoin d'un remplacement \u00e0 temps plein pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de la compagnie \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 SLH entrait dans la p\u00e9riode la plus occup\u00e9e de l'ann\u00e9e - le printemps et le d\u00e9but de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, auquel moment des articles de prix unitaire \u00e9lev\u00e9 devaient \u00eatre livr\u00e9s. SLH avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 perdu plusieurs chauffeurs importants de parcours de distribution en 2006 et les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e9taient tous utilis\u00e9s. M. Smith \u00e9tait d'avis que l'absence de M. Douglas cr\u00e9ait des difficult\u00e9s en particulier parce que ce dernier devait aussi travailler pendant les vacances et le cong\u00e9 de No\u00ebl des autres employ\u00e9s ainsi que jongler les quarts de travail pour que tout fonctionne. M. Smith devait demander \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel de couvrir les quarts de travail et devait demander aux assistants des chauffeurs de conduire en tant que chauffeurs principaux pour les parcours de distribution. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque en 2007, les chauffeurs \u00e9taient en grande demande et \u00e9taient difficiles \u00e0 embaucher \u00e0 temps partiel. La compagnie avait perdu bon nombre de chauffeurs en raison du boom \u00e9conomique dans l'Ouest canadien. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Smith \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il devait agir dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la compagnie et des op\u00e9rations.\n[27] Le 11 mai 2007, M. Smith a envoy\u00e9 une lettre de cong\u00e9diement \u00e0 M. Douglas. La lettre se lisait comme suit :\nMerci de nous avoir donn\u00e9 une mise \u00e0 jour au sujet de votre absence, comme nous vous l'avons demand\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment. Il est vraiment regrettable que ce qui devait \u00eatre une absence relativement courte lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e en novembre 2006 se soit transform\u00e9e en une absence qui pourrait durer de six mois \u00e0 un an de plus \u00e0 partir d'aujourd'hui. L'absence \u00e0 long terme d'un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein cause \u00e0 SLH Transport des difficult\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles et r\u00e9duit le niveau de service aux clients. Il s'agit d'une situation que nous ne sommes pas pr\u00eats \u00e0 subir une fois de plus pour vous. SLH Transport a une fois de plus d\u00e9pass\u00e9 de beaucoup le maximum de 12 semaines requis pour l'ouverture de votre poste, comme le pr\u00e9voit le Code canadien du travail pour les absences m\u00e9dicales. Pourtant, nous n'avons toujours pas de date de retour au travail dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9. Nous devons donc couper vos liens avec SLH Transport en date du 14 mai 2007 et nous devrons combler le poste \u00e0 temps plein afin d'utiliser de fa\u00e7on plus efficace notre effectif et de mieux servir nos clients.\n[28] M. Douglas a \u00e9t\u00e9 atterr\u00e9 et humili\u00e9 par cette lettre. Il \u00e9tait d'avis que, pendant huit ans, il avait fait du bon travail pour SLH. Il venait tout juste d'acheter une nouvelle maison et s'inqui\u00e9tait au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont il arriverait \u00e0 continuer \u00e0 payer cette maison. Il est devenu inquiet, anxieux, abattu, maussade et d\u00e9prim\u00e9 en raison de la lettre de cong\u00e9diement. Il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il \u00e9tait injuste d'\u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9 alors qu'il attendait une date de chirurgie sur laquelle il n'avait aucun contr\u00f4le et que cela \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent de ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour d'autres chauffeurs de camion qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentement en cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[29] M. Smith a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que sa d\u00e9cision de cong\u00e9dier M. Douglas \u00e9tait strictement une d\u00e9cision commerciale fond\u00e9e sur les besoins op\u00e9rationnels susmentionn\u00e9s. Il n'avait aucune animosit\u00e9 personnelle envers M. Douglas. Il \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas \u00e9tait un chauffeur de camion ad\u00e9quat, mais qu'il \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 peu rentable qui n'avait pas les habilet\u00e9s, la capacit\u00e9 mentale et les qualit\u00e9s de leadership n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper un poste plus complexe, comme celui de r\u00e9partiteur.\n[30] Il avait des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet du fait que M. Douglas avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical pendant presque deux ans au cours des huit ans o\u00f9 il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par la compagnie et qu'il avait, selon M. Smith, omis de tenir la compagnie \u00e0 jour au sujet de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 ou de son pronostic alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 pour les probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 ses deux genoux. M. Smith \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas n'avais pas l'esprit d'\u00e9quipe et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer tout travail suppl\u00e9mentaire qui ne faisait pas partie du nombre minimal de quarts de travail qui lui \u00e9taient offerts. Par cons\u00e9quent, son salaire \u00e9tait l'un des plus bas de tous les chauffeurs de camion de SLH, d'apr\u00e8s M. Smith.\n[31] M. Smith a soutenu que le cong\u00e9diement de M. Douglas n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9 sur des rumeurs ou des insinuations, mais il a admis avoir entendu des histoires au sujet de M. Douglas, qui aurait conduit sa moto hors route ou son v\u00e9hicule tout terrain et qu'il serait all\u00e9 p\u00eacher alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical pour son genou droit - choses que M. Douglas a ni\u00e9es. M. Smith \u00e9tait aussi quelque peu sceptique au sujet des efforts de M. Douglas d'obtenir une date de chirurgie avanc\u00e9e et de retourner au travail plus t\u00f4t que dans les 18 mois \u00e0 deux ans suivant la date \u00e0 laquelle il a quitt\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie. \u00c0 ce sujet, M. Smith a compar\u00e9 sa propre exp\u00e9rience lorsqu'il a lui-m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'obtenir une date de chirurgie et de retourner au travail, apr\u00e8s avoir subi une chirurgie de la coiffe des rotateurs, dans les quelques mois suivant son d\u00e9part, \u00e0 l'incapacit\u00e9 de M. Douglas d'obtenir une date avanc\u00e9e de chirurgie et de revenir au travail. M. Smith a mentionn\u00e9 qu'on lui avait dit en avril 2007 que l'absence de M. Douglas durerait de quatre \u00e0 six mois et que si M. Douglas l'avait tenu \u00e0 jour et avait travaill\u00e9 avec lui, M. Smith lui aurait garanti son poste pendant cette p\u00e9riode, mais qu'en raison des besoins op\u00e9rationnels, il ne pouvait pas le faire sans obtenir des renseignements plus d\u00e9finitifs que ceux que lui avait donn\u00e9s M. Douglas avant la date de cong\u00e9diement.\n[32] Avant d'envoyer \u00e0 M. Douglas le formulaire en avril et de le cong\u00e9dier, M. Smith n'a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Douglas pour voir comment il allait, pour voir si les choses progressaient ou pour tenter de lui trouver des travaux l\u00e9gers ou du travail modifi\u00e9 en attendant la chirurgie. M. Douglas n'a pas non plus communiqu\u00e9 directement avec M. Smith pour lui donner une mise \u00e0 jour ou pour lui demander de lui trouver du travail modifi\u00e9. M. Smith a reconnu dans son t\u00e9moignage que lorsqu'il a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 M. Douglas, il ne savait pas, ou il n'a pas tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer, si M. Douglas serait en mesure de retourner au travail comme chauffeur de camion \u00e0 SLH capable de lever des articles lourds, comme le n\u00e9cessitent les t\u00e2ches normales de chauffeur de camion pour l'entreprise, qu'il s'agisse de parcours de distribution ou non, ou en mesure de faire tout autre travail pour SLH. En aucun temps M. Smith n'a tent\u00e9 d'accommoder M. Douglas ou de lui trouver des travaux l\u00e9gers ou d'autre travail.\n[33] Lorsqu'il a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 M. Douglas, M. Smith n'avait plus aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 trouver du travail pour M. Douglas \u00e0 SLH et il s'est concentr\u00e9 plut\u00f4t sur l'embauche d'un rempla\u00e7ant. Apr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement de M. Douglas, SLH n'a pris aucunes mesures pour le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer et lui trouver un emploi, malgr\u00e9 les communications de Sun Life faisant part du d\u00e9sir de M. Douglas de revenir au travail. SLH n'a pas tent\u00e9 de savoir si, apr\u00e8s la chirurgie, M. Douglas serait en mesure de conduire un camion ou d'effectuer tout autre travail pour l'entreprise. \u00c0 l'audience, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour d\u00e9montrer que M. Douglas avait communiqu\u00e9 directement avec SLH pour \u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 dans quelque poste que ce soit apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, mais il a avis\u00e9 Sun Life de son d\u00e9sir de retourner travailler pour SLH. Sun Life, par l'entremise de Carmen LeFort, une conseill\u00e8re en gestion de la sant\u00e9, s'est enqu\u00e9rie aupr\u00e8s de Sue Reid au nom de M. Douglas \u00e0 ce sujet, sans succ\u00e8s.\n[34] Alors que M. Douglas \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 et recevait des prestations d'ILD pour ses deux premiers cong\u00e9s de maladie, SLH lui a garanti son poste et lui a permis de retourner au travail et de reprendre ses t\u00e2ches de chauffeur de camion, qui comprenaient le fait de lever des articles lourds. SLH ne lui avait pas demand\u00e9 de remplir un formulaire dans lequel il aurait indiqu\u00e9 la date de sa chirurgie ni sa date de retour et n'a jamais exprim\u00e9 d'inqui\u00e9tude au sujet du besoin de trouver un rempla\u00e7ant \u00e0 temps plein. D'autres chauffeurs de camion de SLH avaient aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on au cours des ann\u00e9es et avaient retrouv\u00e9 leur emploi de chauffeur de camion \u00e0 temps plein apr\u00e8s l'ILD, sans aucune restriction au sujet du transport d'articles lourds. Aaron Douglas, le fr\u00e8re du plaignant, a subi une chirurgie au genou et une chirurgie pour une hernie et il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son poste apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical et avoir re\u00e7u des prestations d'ILD pendant plusieurs mois. On lui a attribu\u00e9 des travaux l\u00e9gers comme accommodement en raison de son hernie, pendant une courte p\u00e9riode de temps avant sa chirurgie.\n[35] Au moins quatre autres chauffeurs de camion de SLH qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 entre un et quatre ans en ILD et en cong\u00e9 de maladie pour accidents du travail n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s et n'ont pas eu \u00e0 indiquer quelle serait leur date de chirurgie et leur date de retour au travail. SLH a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 payer leurs primes. Aucune question au sujet du besoin de cong\u00e9dier ces employ\u00e9s ou de leur trouver des rempla\u00e7ants n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es. Il n'existe aucune preuve qu'un autre employ\u00e9 de SLH aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 alors qu'il \u00e9tait en ILD et attendait une chirurgie, ou m\u00eame cong\u00e9di\u00e9 pour toute autre raison. La preuve d\u00e9montre que personne d'autre au sein de SLH n'a perdu de travail en raison des conditions \u00e9conomiques difficiles, mais les postes vacants n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9s.\n[36] Pendant l'\u00e9poque \u00e0 laquelle M. Douglas a travaill\u00e9 en 2006, avant d'\u00eatre en cong\u00e9 en novembre de cette ann\u00e9e, il avait gagn\u00e9 un salaire brut d'environ 3 000 $ par mois. Il \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la quinzaine et des d\u00e9ductions \u00e9taient retir\u00e9es de sa paye pour les imp\u00f4ts, sa contribution \u00e0 son R\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d'\u00e9pargne-retraite (REER) d'environ 4 p. 100, que la compagnie appariait, et pour ses primes d'ensemble d'avantages sociaux de Sun Life. Cet ensemble d'avantages sociaux couvrait les prestations d'assurance m\u00e9dicale, d'assurance dentaire et d'assurance-vie. Cet ensemble \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 \u00e0 65 p. 100 par la compagnie et \u00e0 35 p. 100 par M. Douglas. Le montant de la contribution de M. Douglas \u00e0 la quinzaine pour cet ensemble d'avantages sociaux \u00e9tait d'environ 77 $. M. Douglas payait enti\u00e8rement ses prestations d'ILD \u00e0 m\u00eame son paiement \u00e0 la quinzaine de 77 $.\n[37] Le montant net \u00e0 la quinzaine que M. Douglas recevait pendant la p\u00e9riode imm\u00e9diatement avant qu'il quitte en cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e9tait d'environ 800 $ toutes les deux semaines. Lorsque M. Douglas s'est retrouv\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 et qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par l'ILD apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, il n'a plus re\u00e7u de paiement de la compagnie pour sa couverture d'assurance m\u00e9dicale, d'assurance dentaire et d'assurance-vie Sun Life ni de contribution de la compagnie \u00e0 son REER. Il a d\u00fb avoir recours aux avantages sociaux en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 de Mme Gillis pendant cette p\u00e9riode, qui n'\u00e9taient pas suffisants pour payer toutes ses d\u00e9penses en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9, telles que les frais de physioth\u00e9rapie, dont Sun Life a volontairement pay\u00e9 une partie jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il cesse la physioth\u00e9rapie en septembre 2008. Il recevait mensuellement des prestations d'ILD de 1 830 $, ce qui signifie que le montant net \u00e0 la quinzaine qu'il recevait \u00e9tait environ le m\u00eame lorsqu'il \u00e9tait en ILD que lorsqu'il travaillait. Cela est partiellement d\u00fb au fait que le montant mensuel d'ILD n'\u00e9tait pas imposable. De plus, il n'avait aucune d\u00e9duction pour sa contribution \u00e0 une pension ou pour d'autres co\u00fbts d'avantages sociaux.\n[38] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 M. Douglas a re\u00e7u des prestations d'ILD, il n'a eu \u00e0 faire aucun paiement pour la couverture d'assurance-invalidit\u00e9 puisqu'il recevait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, essentiellement, le revenu net de M. Douglas \u00e9tait approximativement le m\u00eame apr\u00e8s qu'il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que les paiements d'invalidit\u00e9 se terminent le 23 mars 2009, que le revenu qu'il aurait obtenu s'il avait travaill\u00e9. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, s'il avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 par SLH, s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 pour invalidit\u00e9, mais qu'il n'avait pas travaill\u00e9 pour une autre raison (par exemple parce qu'il ne souhaitait pas prendre de quart de travail ou parce que la compagnie n'avait pas de travail pour lui), il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par la compagnie et seuls ses avantages sociaux auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s, puisqu'il n'\u00e9tait seulement r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 que lorsqu'il travaillait r\u00e9ellement. D'un autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, s'il avait travaill\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 SLH, les prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 auraient cess\u00e9 et on lui aurait pay\u00e9 son salaire normal en plus de la partie des frais de l'ensemble d'avantages sociaux que la compagnie payait.\n[39] Avant le cong\u00e9diement, Mme Gillis avait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement communiqu\u00e9 avec le bureau du Dr Gross pour d\u00e9terminer si une date de chirurgie \u00e9tait disponible pour M. Douglas. Comme la lettre de cong\u00e9diement citait son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir une date de chirurgie dans une p\u00e9riode raisonnable de temps comme raison pour le cong\u00e9diement, avec l'aide de Mme Gillis, M. Douglas a \u00e9crit au bureau du Dr Gross peu de temps apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement pour mentionner qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 en raison de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir un rendez-vous pour sa chirurgie et pour demander si le Dr Gross pouvait lui donner une date de chirurgie. La lettre demandait au Dr Gross d'aviser M. Douglas si une date avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e et d'indiquer si M. Douglas attendait r\u00e9ellement une chirurgie. En r\u00e9ponse, le Dr Gross lui a r\u00e9\u00e9crit le 17 mai 2007 pour l'aviser qu'il ne pouvait pas lui donner une date de chirurgie puisque l'allocation des dates fonctionnait par rapport \u00e0 la priorit\u00e9 et qu'il faudrait du temps avant que le rendez-vous de M. Douglas soit pr\u00e9vu. Le Dr Gross a exprim\u00e9 sa frustration et sa sympathie au sujet de la situation.\n[40] Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Douglas est all\u00e9 voir la Dre Leckey pour d\u00e9terminer si elle pouvait le r\u00e9f\u00e9rer \u00e0 quelqu'un d'autre qui pourrait effectuer la chirurgie plus rapidement. Elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Yepes, un chirurgien au Cap-Breton. M. Douglas et son fr\u00e8re Aaron ont effectu\u00e9 le voyage de quatre heures jusqu'au bureau du Dr Yepes \u00e0 Sydney en octobre 2007. Le Dr Yepes a dit \u00e0 M. Douglas qu'il devait subir une chirurgie et qu'on communiquerait avec lui lorsqu'une date de chirurgie serait \u00e9tablie \u00e0 New Waterford. Mme Gillis a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement avec le bureau du Dr Yepes pour tenter d'obtenir une date de chirurgie pour M. Douglas.\n[41] Le 17 janvier 2008, M. Douglas a subi sa chirurgie en raison d'une annulation qui avait eu lieu dans l'horaire de chirurgie du Dr Yepes. Apr\u00e8s la chirurgie, M. Douglas a eu des consultations postop\u00e9ratoires avec le Dr Yepes pendant environ six semaines apr\u00e8s la chirurgie et il a ensuite subi de la physioth\u00e9rapie \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement Beaverbank Orthopaedic and Sport Physiotherapy (Beaverbank) trois fois par semaine.\n[42] M. Douglas a commenc\u00e9 la physioth\u00e9rapie \u00e0 Beaverbank en mars 2008. La physioth\u00e9rapie lui \u00e9tait administr\u00e9e par Chris Bergman, une physioth\u00e9rapeute et la directrice de Beaverbank, trois fois par semaine jusqu'en septembre 2008, auquel moment Mme Bergman a donn\u00e9 son cong\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Douglas parce que ses progr\u00e8s avaient, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, atteint selon elle un plateau. M. Douglas avait des exercices \u00e0 effectuer \u00e0 la clinique et \u00e0 la maison. Au d\u00e9but, il ressentait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement des douleurs et de l'inconfort importants \u00e0 son genou droit lorsqu'il faisait les exercices, mais avec le temps et la physioth\u00e9rapie continue, ainsi qu'avec les exercices \u00e0 la maison, son \u00e9tat s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9 vers juin 2008. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, sa force s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9e, cependant, lorsqu'il ajoutait du poids sur son genou droit, M. Douglas avait plus de difficult\u00e9 que lorsqu'il effectuait des exercices sans poids ajout\u00e9, parce qu'une partie du coussinage avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de son genou lors de la chirurgie.\n[43] Le 23 septembre 2008, Mme Bergman a effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles de M. Douglas. Cette \u00e9valuation porte aussi le nom d'\u00e9valuation des aptitudes physiques. Le test a \u00e9t\u00e9 administr\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de Carmen LeFort afin de d\u00e9terminer quel \u00e9tait le potentiel de r\u00e9habilitation de M. Douglas. \u00c0 la suite de l'\u00e9valuation de M. Douglas, Mme Bergman a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'en septembre 2008, il ne pouvait pas lever des poids lourds ou tr\u00e8s lourds, mais il pouvait lever, transporter, pousser ou tirer des poids moyens. Cela signifiait qu'il pouvait parfois lever des articles entre 21 et 50 livres, fr\u00e9quemment lever des articles entre 11 et 25 livres et constamment lever des articles d'une \u00e0 cinq livres. Mme Bergman \u00e9tait d'avis que, en raison de l'\u00e9tat de son genou droit, il ne pouvait pas lever des articles tels que des r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateurs, des fours, des laveuses, des s\u00e9cheuses et des tracteurs \u00e0 gazon, qui faisaient normalement partie des parcours de distribution qu'il avait au sein de SLH, m\u00eame avec l'\u00e9quipement fourni par SLH pour ces parcours.\n[44] \u00c0 la demande de l'avocat du plaignant, Mme Bergman a aussi pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une lettre le 23 mars 2009 fond\u00e9e sur les r\u00e9sultats de l'\u00e9valuation fonctionnelle de septembre 2008 afin de d\u00e9terminer si M. Douglas pouvait, en date de septembre 2008, retourner au travail avec ou sans accommodement sur un horaire modifi\u00e9 ou \u00e0 temps plein dans les diverses cat\u00e9gories de parcours de distribution, de transport \u00e0 destination, sans avoir \u00e0 lever des poids lourds, ou du travail administratif qui ne comportait pas de conduite de camion. Elle a conclu qu'il ne pouvait pas retourner aux parcours de distribution ni aux transports \u00e0 destination qui comportaient le fait de lever des poids lourds, mais qu'il aurait pu reprendre son travail de chauffeur de camion dans des transports \u00e0 destination qui ne comportaient pas le fait de lever des poids lourds et qu'il aurait pu retourner au travail dans un poste administratif, du point de vue physique.\n[45] Ruth Duggan est une ergoth\u00e9rapeute qui est travailleuse ind\u00e9pendante pour les Cornerstone Occupational Therapy Consultants (Cornerstone). Mme Duggan et Chris Bergman ont livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage d'expert \u00e0 l'audience. Mme Duggan effectue des analyses de demandes d'emploi, de la r\u00e9adaptation judiciaire et des \u00e9valuations de la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle pour d\u00e9terminer si des employ\u00e9s bless\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre jumel\u00e9s \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents emplois ou si on peut les accommoder dans le secteur industriel. Sans que Mme Duggar n'ait rencontr\u00e9 ni examin\u00e9 M. Douglas, SLH lui a demand\u00e9 d'examiner son dossier m\u00e9dical et d'utiliser les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux et les renseignements fonctionnels du dossier afin de d\u00e9terminer quelles \u00e9taient ses capacit\u00e9s. Elle devait ensuite examiner les autres postes disponibles au sein de SLH et analyser ces postes afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il y avait un emploi qui correspondait aux habilet\u00e9s et aux capacit\u00e9s de M. Douglas et si des accommodements raisonnables pouvaient \u00eatre faits. Elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son rapport le 7 mai 2009. Avant d'\u00e9crire son rapport, elle a rencontr\u00e9 M. Smith et lui a pos\u00e9 des questions au sujet des diff\u00e9rents emplois qui \u00e9taient disponibles au sein de SLH. Elle a aussi visit\u00e9 le terminal pendant environ une demi-journ\u00e9e \u00e0 Bedford pour observer le fonctionnement. Elle a observ\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s alors qu'ils travaillaient et a pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 un certain nombre d'entre eux au sujet de leurs diverses t\u00e2ches. Elle a effectu\u00e9 quelques enqu\u00eates, y compris la pes\u00e9e des articles et l'observation de situations afin d'effectuer ses recherches.\n[46] Mme Duggan a suppos\u00e9 que l'\u00e9valuation des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles ou l'\u00e9valuation des aptitudes physiques, effectu\u00e9e par Mme Bergman en septembre 2008, \u00e9tait correcte. Elle a suppos\u00e9 que les capacit\u00e9s de M. Douglas \u00e9taient d'effectuer du travail \u00e0 un niveau de demande physique moyen, tel que le fait de lever, de transporter, de d\u00e9placer, de pousser ou de tirer des articles jusqu'\u00e0 environ 50 livres de fa\u00e7on occasionnelle et jusqu'\u00e0 environ 25 livres de fa\u00e7on plus fr\u00e9quente au cours d'une journ\u00e9e. Elle a aussi examin\u00e9 le rapport d'analyse des comp\u00e9tences transf\u00e9rables qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Banyan Work Health Solutions (Banyan) en mai 2008, tel que demand\u00e9 par Sun Life, qui ciblait diff\u00e9rents emplois que M. Douglas serait probablement en mesure d'occuper.\n[47] Bien que la conduite d'un camion fusse un emploi cibl\u00e9 par Banyan comme compatible, Mme Duggan \u00e9tait d'avis que comme le fait de conduire un camion signifiait diff\u00e9rentes choses selon ce qui \u00e9tait requis de la personne, il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9terminer ce que le terme signifiait relativement aux emplois disponibles au sein de SLH. Elle a examin\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rents emplois de conduite de camion \u00e0 SLH, y compris le parcours de distribution, qui selon elle relevait d'une situation de demande physique difficile et lourde du point de vue des exigences physiques, parce qu'il n\u00e9cessitait le fait de lever fr\u00e9quemment des articles de plus de 50 livres, m\u00eame s'il y avait deux personnes sur place. Elle a conclu qu'il s'agirait d'une demande physique lourde que M. Douglas ne pouvait pas soutenir.\n[48] Mme Duggan a aussi examin\u00e9 les autres parcours qui pouvaient occasionnellement \u00eatre du transport \u00e0 destination sans avoir \u00e0 lever de poids, mais qui n\u00e9cessiteraient quand m\u00eame une demande physique moyenne pour lever les b\u00e9quilles du tracteur de remorque. Il s'agissait d'une t\u00e2che moyenne que M. Douglas \u00e9tait capable de faire. Cependant, le transport \u00e0 destination ne repr\u00e9sentait qu'une minorit\u00e9 du travail du transport ne comportant pas de distribution dans une journ\u00e9e normale et cela variait d'un jour \u00e0 l'autre. La majorit\u00e9 du travail ne comportant pas de distribution lors d'une journ\u00e9e normale comportait le chargement, le d\u00e9chargement et le fait de lever dans une certaine mesure, pour un seul employ\u00e9, des articles lourds. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle \u00e9tait d'avis que le travail au sein de SLH qui n'\u00e9tait pas de la distribution comportait le fait de lever des poids lourds et que M. Douglas ne serait pas capable de faire ce travail, puisqu'il n'\u00e9tait pas capable de fournir un effort physique plus que moyen. Ainsi, Mme Duggan \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas ne pourrait pas \u00eatre chauffeur de camion pour SLH, puisque ce poste entra\u00eenait toujours une certaine quantit\u00e9 de transport de poids lourds qui d\u00e9passait ses capacit\u00e9s.\n[49] Mme Duggan a ensuite examin\u00e9 les autres postes disponibles au sein de SLH, y compris le poste de r\u00e9partiteur, puisque le rapport de Banyan avait cibl\u00e9 ce poste comme un jumelage potentiel d'emploi. Elle a conclu que le poste de r\u00e9partition entra\u00eenait plus que les t\u00e2ches normales de r\u00e9partition, mais qu'il comportait aussi un r\u00f4le de supervision qui pla\u00e7ait le poste dans une autre cat\u00e9gorie en termes d'aptitudes cognitives n\u00e9cessaires, ainsi que d'aptitudes organisationnelles, d'aptitudes de communication et d'aptitudes en leadership. Elle a conclu que ce poste comprenait des situations possibles de confrontation avec les employ\u00e9s et les clients, ainsi que des situations disciplinaires. Elle \u00e9tait d'avis que bien que M. Douglas ait les capacit\u00e9s physiques pour effectuer ce travail, rien ne donnait \u00e0 penser qu'il serait en mesure de faire le travail du point de vue cognitif et du point de vue de la supervision ou de la gestion. Cependant, elle a reconnu qu'aucun examen n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait des capacit\u00e9s mentales ou des autres capacit\u00e9s de M. Douglas pour ce poste.\n[50] Mme Duggan a aussi examin\u00e9 le potentiel de M. Douglas de travailler comme m\u00e9canicien pour SLH. Cependant, pour \u00eatre m\u00e9canicien, il lui fallait avoir une certaine formation, y compris un cours de formation de quatre ans. Elle a conclu qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un jumelage appropri\u00e9 pour M. Douglas. Elle a aussi examin\u00e9 les autres fonctions administratives, y compris des emplois de bureau, au sein de SLH, mais elle a conclu qu'il n'existait aucun jumelage appropri\u00e9 pour ces emplois, puisque M. Douglas n'avait aucune exp\u00e9rience, aucune qualification ou aucune formation pour ces postes.\n[51] Le 28 mai 2009, \u00e0 la demande de Mme Raymond, Mme Bergman a examin\u00e9 le rapport de Mme Duggan. Elle \u00e9tait d'accord avec Mme Duggan que ni le parcours de distribution ni le transport \u00e0 destination comportant le fait de manuellement lever des articles lourds et de charger et de d\u00e9charger le camion serait un bon jumelage compte tenu des capacit\u00e9s physiques de M. Douglas. Mme Bergman a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas pouvait effectuer le travail d'un r\u00e9partiteur du point de vue physique, mais a not\u00e9 que le rapport de Mme Duggan soulignait qu'il n'avait pas les aptitudes de calcul et de bureau n\u00e9cessaires pour occuper ce poste. Mme Bergman \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas devrait subir un examen objectif pour ces exigences. Elle \u00e9tait d'accord avec Mme Duggan que M. Douglas n'avait pas la formation n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00eatre m\u00e9canicien.\n[52] Dans une autre lettre dat\u00e9e du 3 juin 2009, une fois de plus en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une demande de Mme Raymond, Mme Bergman a soulign\u00e9 que si le poste de chauffeur de camion \u00e9tait purement constitu\u00e9 de transports \u00e0 destination, comme le poste que le plaignant occupe pr\u00e9sentement chez HBC, il serait en mesure d'effectuer ce travail sans avoir besoin d'accommodement.\n[53] Karen MacDonald, une gestionnaire de dossiers, capacit\u00e9s, chez Sun Life a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Sue Reid de SLH, en mars 2007, si SLH \u00e9tait en mesure d'accommoder M. Douglas avec des travaux l\u00e9gers, mais Sue Reid lui a r\u00e9pondu que SLH n'avait besoin que de chauffeur s de camion et d'employ\u00e9s d'entrep\u00f4t, ce qui ne correspondait pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9tat de M. Douglas \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. En juin 2007, SLH a avis\u00e9 Carmen LeFort que M. Douglas ne serait pas r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 de toute fa\u00e7on. Carmen LeFort a rencontr\u00e9 M. Douglas en mai 2008 pour examiner d'autres possibilit\u00e9s de travail. Elle l'a r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Banyan pour l'aider \u00e0 se trouver un nouveau travail et pour recevoir de la formation, mais apr\u00e8s un premier contact lors duquel Banyan a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son rapport au sujet des capacit\u00e9s fonctionnelles et de l'analyse des comp\u00e9tences transf\u00e9rables de M. Douglas, la firme n'a pas effectu\u00e9 de suivi aupr\u00e8s de ce dernier. SLH n'a jamais exprim\u00e9 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de permettre \u00e0 M. Douglas de revenir au travail apr\u00e8s l'envoi de la lettre de cong\u00e9diement et malgr\u00e9 les communications de Sun Life \u00e0 savoir si des possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi pour M. Douglas existaient.\n[54] SLH n'a jamais tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer les capacit\u00e9s de M. Douglas apr\u00e8s qu'il a quitt\u00e9 le travail en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes au genou droit et apr\u00e8s sa chirurgie afin de le r\u00e9embaucher, et n'a jamais d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 d'efforts pour l'accommoder en milieu de travail en changeant le poste de chauffeur de camion, en lui offrant une autre formation, en le r\u00e9affectant dans d'autres domaines d'op\u00e9rations au sein de SLH ou en lui offrant du travail modifi\u00e9. Carmen LeFort a avis\u00e9 Sue Reid le 6 mai 2008 que M. Douglas participait \u00e0 un programme de r\u00e9adaptation, qu'il \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail et qu'elle continuerait de donner des mises \u00e0 jour \u00e0 Sue Reid. SLH a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'y avait aucun emploi disponible pour M. Douglas.\n[55] Carmen LeFort, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience, \u00e9tait d'avis que M. Douglas a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail au sein de SLH. Il a obtenu sa propre date de chirurgie. Il s'est rendu au Cap-Breton pour subir sa chirurgie. Lisa Gillis et lui sont toujours rest\u00e9s en contact avec Sun Life. M. Douglas a toujours communiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Sun Life son d\u00e9sir de retourner \u00e0 SLH comme il l'avait fait lorsqu'il avait subi sa chirurgie au genou gauche.\n[56] M. Douglas a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se chercher du travail ailleurs apr\u00e8s que Mme Bergman l'a avis\u00e9 en septembre 2008 que ses progr\u00e8s avaient atteint un plateau et qu'elle lui donne son cong\u00e9 de la physioth\u00e9rapie. Vers cette \u00e9poque, Sun Life a pay\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Douglas un montant forfaitaire d'environ 8 000 $ pour le reste de ses avantages d'ILD impay\u00e9s jusqu'au 23 mars 2009 et a ferm\u00e9 son dossier. Avec l'aide de Mme Gillis, il a envoy\u00e9 des demandes d'emploi avec son CV \u00e0 divers employeurs pour des postes de chauffeur de camion. Il a finalement trouv\u00e9 son emploi actuel chez HBC comme chauffeur de camion dans un poste purement de transports \u00e0 destination, o\u00f9 il est entr\u00e9 en fonctions le 1er avril 2009.\n[57] M. Douglas a reconnu que son poste actuel \u00e9tait parfait, puisqu'il n'a pas \u00e0 lever, \u00e0 charger ou \u00e0 d\u00e9charger des articles et que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration est pratiquement la m\u00eame que celle qu'il recevait chez SLH. Il a admis qu'il ne peut plus effectuer de parcours de distribution en raison du stress que cela causerait \u00e0 son genou droit. Il a aussi reconnu qu'il n'existait pas de transport purement \u00e0 destination \u00e0 SLH, puisque tous les parcours exigeaient qu'il l\u00e8ve des articles lourds et qu'il charge et qu'il d\u00e9charge le camion. N\u00e9anmoins, il a exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir d'\u00eatre r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 au sein de SLH soit comme chauffeur de camion, avec les changements et les accommodements n\u00e9cessaires pour correspondre \u00e0 ses capacit\u00e9s, soit comme r\u00e9partiteur. Il est d'avis qu'il pourrait \u00eatre form\u00e9 afin de devenir r\u00e9partiteur, m\u00eame s'il n'a aucune exp\u00e9rience en la mati\u00e8re.\n[58] M. Douglas croit que SLH a fait preuve de discrimination envers lui en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience physique. Il est d'avis que ce n'est pas par sa faute, mais plut\u00f4t en raison des probl\u00e8mes importants d'\u00e9tablissement de calendrier pour la chirurgie du syst\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qu'il a perdu son emploi. La preuve d\u00e9montre que jusqu'\u00e0 la fin avril 2009, le Dr Gross n'aurait pas pu lui r\u00e9server une date de chirurgie, s'il avait attendu que le Dr Gross soit libre pour effectuer la chirurgie.\n[59] Apr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement de M. Douglas, deux nouveaux chauffeurs de camion ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s pour des parcours de distribution. De plus, deux employ\u00e9s existants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s aux op\u00e9rations de r\u00e9partition. L'un de ces employ\u00e9s est devenu r\u00e9partiteur \u00e0 temps plein en juin 2007, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9partiteur \u00e0 temps partiel. De plus, un chauffeur de camion a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 comme r\u00e9partiteur \u00e0 temps partiel en mars 2009. Il y a eu un concours pour un poste \u00e0 temps partiel, qui comprenait un test g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et un test d'aptitudes math\u00e9matiques. Le candidat retenu avait un dipl\u00f4me universitaire et a obtenu le meilleur r\u00e9sultat de l'examen.\n[60] M. Smith n'\u00e9tait pas d'avis que M. Douglas avait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour \u00eatre r\u00e9partiteur. Il croyait que M. Douglas n'avait pas les qualit\u00e9s requises en mati\u00e8re de leadership pour donner des directives \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire, ni le niveau d'intelligence n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9velopper les diverses habilet\u00e9s en informatique et en math\u00e9matiques requises pour d\u00e9terminer les besoins en mati\u00e8re de chargement et dans d'autres domaines reli\u00e9s. Il ne croyait pas non plus que M. Douglas avait les habilet\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour traiter avec les clients et les employ\u00e9s dans des situations de stress qui existaient en r\u00e9partition.\n[61] SLH n'a pas de poste de chauffeur de camion \u00e0 combler pr\u00e9sentement en raison du d\u00e9clin de l'\u00e9conomie. Selon le t\u00e9moignage incontest\u00e9 de M. Smith, aucun nouveau chauffeur n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment et, en raison de deux d\u00e9parts, l'effectif des chauffeurs a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duit et les postes vacants n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 combl\u00e9s.\n[62] M. Smith a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'aucun \u00e9quipement ne pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9curitaire pour accommoder M. Douglas si celui-ci occupait un poste de chauffeur de camion au sein de SLH dans lequel il n'aurait pas \u00e0 lever d'articles lourds, pour respecter ses restrictions physiques. L'\u00e9quipement que SLH utilise est le meilleur que l'industrie peut offrir \u00e0 ce sujet et les divers types de v\u00e9rins hydrauliques ou de chariots \u00e9l\u00e9vateurs \u00e0 fourche sur le march\u00e9 seraient trop lourds pour \u00eatre entrepos\u00e9s dans un camion et pourraient d\u00e9truire les rampes de chargement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'y avait aucun moyen d'accommoder une personne telle que M. Douglas dans un poste de chauffeur de camion au sein de SLH.\n[63] M. Smith a reconnu que si ce n'\u00e9tait des probl\u00e8mes de genou droit de M. Douglas et de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 revenir au travail dans les six mois suivant son d\u00e9part, alors qu'il attendait une chirurgie, il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9.\nIV. Les questions en litige [64] Deux questions doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce :\nLe plaignant a-t-il \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience? L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable qui ne constitue pas un pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 la discrimination?\nV. ANALYSE ET CONCLUSIONS [65] La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. La r\u00e9plique ou l'explication doit \u00eatre crue et ne pas se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler \u00eatre un pr\u00e9texte; voir CCDP c. Canada, 2005 CAF 154, paragraphe 26. Lorsqu'un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il a droit \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration en l'absence de justification de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 36; Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, paragraphe 18.\n[66] Une fois que la preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de la preuve incombe par la suite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qui doit montrer que l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne s'est pas produit tel qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l'acte \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9. Il n'est pas essentiel que des consid\u00e9rations d'ordre discriminatoire soient les seuls motifs de la question en litige pour que la plainte soit maintenue. Il suffit que la discrimination ne soit que l'une des raisons de l'acte ou de la d\u00e9cision. Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12) (C.A.F.).\n[67] L'intim\u00e9e a mis fin \u00e0 l'emploi du plaignant \u00e0 titre de chauffeur de camion alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical justifi\u00e9 de six mois en attente d'une chirurgie pour son genou droit. Les motifs donn\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e pour le cong\u00e9diement \u00e9taient que l'absence du plaignant lui causait des difficult\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles dans ses activit\u00e9s d'entreprise et qu'en raison de cette absence, ainsi que de l'incapacit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 fournir une date d\u00e9finitive de chirurgie et de retour au travail, l'intim\u00e9e devait le cong\u00e9dier et embaucher un rempla\u00e7ant \u00e0 temps plein. Le plaignant a fait tout ce qu'il pouvait pour obtenir une date de chirurgie. Il n'avait aucun contr\u00f4le sur l'\u00e9tablissement d'un calendrier pour sa chirurgie. Sauf pour le paiement des frais de sa part des avantages sociaux, l'intim\u00e9e n'a encouru aucun frais d'emploi ou de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration alors que le plaignant \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical avant son cong\u00e9diement.\n[68] Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\n[69] L'intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'argument, \u00e0 titre de justification et d'explication, qu'elle s'\u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur les renseignements qu'elle avait re\u00e7us au sujet du Code canadien du travail lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cong\u00e9dier le plaignant seulement apr\u00e8s que 12 semaines se soient \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis le d\u00e9but de son cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical. \u00c0 ce sujet, le paragraphe 239(1) du Code canadien du travail pr\u00e9voit :\nINTERDICTION\n239.(1) SOUS R\u00c9SERVE DU PARAGRAPHE (1.1), L'EMPLOYEUR NE PEUT CONG\u00c9DIER, SUSPENDRE, METTRE \u00c0 PIED NI R\u00c9TROGRADER UN EMPLOY\u00c9, NI PRENDRE DES MESURES DISCIPLINAIRES CONTRE LUI, POUR ABSENCE EN RAISON DE MALADIE OU D'ACCIDENT SI CELUI-CI REMPLIT PAR AILLEURS LES CONDITIONS SUIVANTES :\nA) IL TRAVAILLE SANS INTERRUPTION POUR LUI DEPUIS AU MOINS TROIS MOIS;\nB) IL N'EST PAS ABSENT PENDANT PLUS DE DOUZE SEMAINES;\nC) IL FOURNIT \u00c0 L'EMPLOYEUR, SUR DEMANDE DE CELUI-CI PR\u00c9SENT\u00c9E PAR \u00c9CRIT DANS LES QUINZE JOURS DU RETOUR AU TRAVAIL, UN CERTIFICAT D'UN M\u00c9DECIN QUALIFI\u00c9 ATTESTANT QU'IL \u00c9TAIT, POUR CAUSE DE MALADIE OU D'ACCIDENT, INCAPABLE DE TRAVAILLER PENDANT LA P\u00c9RIODE QUI Y EST PR\u00c9CIS\u00c9E, CELLE-CI DEVANT CORRESPONDRE \u00c0 CELLE DE L'ABSENCE.\n[70] Le Code vise \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les employ\u00e9s. L'article susmentionn\u00e9 du Code est une interdiction de l'employeur de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical avant 12 semaines si celui-ci a travaill\u00e9 pour l'employeur pendant au moins trois mois sans interruption, dans les cas comme celui en l'esp\u00e8ce o\u00f9 il y a cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical pour une blessure qui n'est pas li\u00e9e au travail. Cet article n'accorde pas la permission, de fa\u00e7on paradoxale, \u00e0 un employeur de contrevenir \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne dans des circonstances telles que celles qui existent en l'esp\u00e8ce. Une conclusion contraire subordonnerait la Loi au Code, malgr\u00e9 le fait que ces deux mesures l\u00e9gislatives visent \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les employ\u00e9s. M\u00eame si le paragraphe 239(1) du Code et l'article 7 de la Loi sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on conflictuelle l'un envers l'autre, la Loi a pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance \u00e0 titre de mesure l\u00e9gislative quasi-constitutionnelle. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia c. Heerspink, [1982] 2 R.C.S. 145, Winnipeg School Division No. 1 c. Craton, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 150, Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba [1995] 2 C.F. 569, Canada c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, au paragraphe 81.\n[71] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'explication ou de justification raisonnable pour la fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dont elle a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[72] L'alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) et le paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voient des exceptions pour des cas qui seraient autrement consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des actes discriminatoires :\n15. (1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l'employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu'ils d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\nBesoins des individus\n(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a (1)g), s'il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[73] La preuve incontest\u00e9e d\u00e9montre qu'au moment o\u00f9 M. Douglas a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, plusieurs autres chauffeurs de camion \u00e9taient aussi en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical pour des p\u00e9riodes consid\u00e9rablement plus longues que le cong\u00e9 du plaignant et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9e ni questionn\u00e9s au sujet du moment auquel ils retourneraient possiblement au travail. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas non plus senti le besoin de les cong\u00e9dier et d'embaucher des rempla\u00e7ants \u00e0 temps plein pour ces chauffeurs. Toute la preuve produite \u00e0 l'audience au sujet de la capacit\u00e9 du plaignant \u00e0 effectuer son travail apr\u00e8s sa chirurgie ou \u00e0 \u00eatre accommod\u00e9 dans un autre poste est venue apr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement et a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite pour les besoins de l'audience. Au moment du cong\u00e9diement, l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas, d'une quelconque fa\u00e7on, examin\u00e9 si le plaignant pouvait revenir au travail apr\u00e8s sa chirurgie, comme il l'avait fait plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t apr\u00e8s sa chirurgie au genou gauche et comme les autres employ\u00e9s avaient pu le faire sans \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9s ni remplac\u00e9s. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas non plus, au moment du cong\u00e9diement, examin\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 d'offrir au plaignant des travaux modifi\u00e9s ou de l'accommoder d'une quelconque fa\u00e7on en milieu de travail en changeant son emploi ou en lui offrant d'autres possibilit\u00e9s.\n[74] Par cons\u00e9quent, les dispositions de l'alin\u00e9a 15 (1)a) de la Loi ne s'appliquent pas en l'esp\u00e8ce et ne peuvent pas exempter la conduite de l'intim\u00e9e des pratiques discriminatoires.\nVI. LA D\u00c9CISION [75] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessus, je conclus que la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\nVII. R\u00c9PARATIONS [76] Le plaignant m'a demand\u00e9 d'exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin de rendre une ordonnance comprenant les diverses dispositions suivantes, pr\u00e9vues aux paragraphes 53(2) et (3) de la Loi :\n53.(2) \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\nb) d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9e;\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte;\ne) d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(3) Outre les pouvoirs que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe (2), le membre instructeur peut ordonner \u00e0 l'auteur d'un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[77] Compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, il ne convient pas que j'exerce mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53 (2)b), d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9embaucher le plaignant. Une telle ordonnance obligerait le plaignant \u00e0 abandonner son poste actuel chez HBC, qu'il a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant l'emploi parfait, et obligerait l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le plaignant dans un environnement de travail o\u00f9 il ne semble pas, compte tenu de la preuve, exister un emploi de conduite de camion que le plaignant puisse physiquement effectuer ni d'autre travail qu'il soit pr\u00e9sentement qualifi\u00e9 pour faire ou qui lui soit disponible. Je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 risquer la possibilit\u00e9 que le plaignant ne soit pas en mesure d'effectuer le travail chez l'intim\u00e9e apr\u00e8s qu'il a quitt\u00e9 son emploi parfait chez HBC. L'objectif des r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9vues par la Loi est d'accorder au plaignant les droits dont l'acte l'a priv\u00e9. L'effet d'inclure dans une ordonnance la clause demand\u00e9e serait contraire \u00e0 cet objectif. Milano c. Triple K Transport, 2003 TCDP 30, au paragraphe 63; OHRC c. Naraine, 2001 CanLII 21234, aux paragraphes 68 \u00e0 74.\n[78] Compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, il ne convient pas que j'exerce mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c), d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser le plaignant pour toute perte de salaire, puisque le plaignant n'a pas perdu de salaire. Le plaignant n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e s'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9, sauf s'il avait r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9. Alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, le plaignant a re\u00e7u essentiellement le m\u00eame montant net de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration par l'entremise de ses prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 que celui qu'il aurait obtenu s'il avait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme chauffeur de camion pour l'intim\u00e9e. Ses prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 se sont termin\u00e9es dans la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le moment o\u00f9 il a trouv\u00e9 un nouvel emploi qui lui a donn\u00e9 le m\u00eame salaire, ou un meilleur salaire, qu'il recevait lorsqu'il travaillait pour l'intim\u00e9e. En d'autres mots, s'il n'y avait pas eu acte discriminatoire contre le plaignant, c'est-\u00e0-dire le cong\u00e9diement pendant son cong\u00e9 de maladie, il aurait soit (i) poursuivi son cong\u00e9 de maladie en ne recevant que ses prestations d'invalidit\u00e9, de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que lorsqu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie plusieurs ann\u00e9es plus t\u00f4t pour sa chirurgie au genou gauche ou (ii) il serait retourn\u00e9 au travail \u00e0 un certain moment avant la fin mars 2009 et il aurait alors re\u00e7u son salaire de l'intim\u00e9e, mais il n'aurait pas re\u00e7u de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9, qui correspondaient essentiellement au m\u00eame montant que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration qu'il aurait re\u00e7ue de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[79] Compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, il convient que j'exerce mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e), d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser le plaignant pour le pr\u00e9judice moral dont il a souffert en raison de la pratique discriminatoire. Plus t\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'ai r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les faits concernant les r\u00e9percussions du cong\u00e9diement du plaignant apr\u00e8s presque neuf ans d'emploi, alors qu'il attendait une date de chirurgie pour son genou. Le cong\u00e9diement soudain a \u00e9t\u00e9 un coup dur pour une personne qui souffrait d\u00e9j\u00e0 des douleurs et des difficult\u00e9s caus\u00e9es par sa blessure et qui avait des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de probl\u00e8mes d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Le cong\u00e9diement lui a caus\u00e9, pendant une longue p\u00e9riode de temps, de l'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de la d\u00e9pression et du d\u00e9sespoir. Il croyait qu'il n'avait aucun emploi ou aucune possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 il n'allait pas bien et o\u00f9 il avait des dettes en raison de la maison qu'il venait tout juste d'acheter. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 d'un montant de quinze milles (15 000 $) dollars conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi.\n[80] Compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, il convient que j'exerce mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 53(3), d'ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant une indemnit\u00e9 pour avoir d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment cong\u00e9di\u00e9 le plaignant alors qu'il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi. Une fois de plus, les faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9tablis dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision indiquent que, bien que l'intim\u00e9e soutienne qu'elle n'avait aucune animosit\u00e9 envers le plaignant, ses actions ont donn\u00e9 une autre impression. Le plaignant tentait clairement d'obtenir une date de chirurgie - fait dont l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant. Il est bien connu que pr\u00e9sentement au Canada les p\u00e9riodes d'attente sont tr\u00e8s longues pour les interventions chirurgicales non urgentes. Aucune preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce ne porte \u00e0 croire que le plaignant avait un mauvais rendement ou une mauvaise conduite dans le pass\u00e9. L'intim\u00e9e ne payait pas de salaire au plaignant pendant son cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical, donc il n'y aurait pas eu de perte mon\u00e9taire r\u00e9elle pour l'intim\u00e9e si celle-ci avait gard\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 son emploi, du moins jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle puisse d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant pouvait retourner au travail apr\u00e8s sa chirurgie. L'intim\u00e9e n'a pas cong\u00e9di\u00e9 d'autres chauffeurs de camion parce qu'ils \u00e9taient en cong\u00e9 de maladie pour des p\u00e9riodes beaucoup plus longues que le plaignant, et elle ne leur a pas demand\u00e9 des renseignements au sujet de la date pr\u00e9vue de chirurgie. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de payer au plaignant la somme de dix mille (10 000 $) dollars, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\nEdward P.

D\u00c9CISION\nI. LA PLAINTE A. A. D\u00e9ficience physique et situation de famille - emploi [1] Le plaignant, Charles Breast, est un membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Whitefish Lake no 128 (Whitefish ), situ\u00e9e \u00e0 220 kilom\u00e8tres au nord-est d'Edmonton (Alberta). M. Breast est diab\u00e9tique. Pendant environ 13 ans, il a conduit le camion d'eau et les autobus scolaires de Whitefish. En janvier 2007, il a subi une perte temporaire de la vision dans son il droit. Il a demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 du travail, qu'il a obtenu. \u00c0 la fin avril 2007, M. Breast a tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail, soutenant que sa vision \u00e9tait revenue \u00e0 la normale. M. Breast d\u00e9clare que lorsqu'il a approch\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s de Whitefish afin de discuter de son retour au travail, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 menac\u00e9 et on lui a dit qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus le bienvenu. Depuis ce moment, Whitefish a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Breast de fournir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9cis afin qu'il puisse retourner au travail. \u00c0 la fin juillet 2007, M. Breast a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Whitefish une note de son m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l'appui de son d\u00e9sir de retourner au travail. Whitefish a alors demand\u00e9 d'autres pr\u00e9cisions m\u00e9dicales, que M. Breast a fournies en juillet 2008. Peu apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception de ces pr\u00e9cisions, Whitefish lui a offert, sous conditions, un poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout. M. Breast a rejet\u00e9 cette offre.\n[2] M. Breast soutient que Whitefish a exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 son endroit de la discrimination du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience en refusant de lui redonner son emploi et en le cong\u00e9diant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9guis\u00e9e. Il fait aussi valoir que Whitefish a fait preuve de discrimination envers lui du fait de sa situation de famille en donnant son poste de conducteur de camion d'eau au fr\u00e8re de l'ancien chef.\nII. LES CONCLUSIONS DE FAIT A. Conclusions en l'esp\u00e8ce (i) Cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical [3] M. Breast conduisait de gros camions pour transporter de l'eau et il travaillait souvent seul. Il travaillait environ 13 \u00e0 14 heures par jour. Le poste comprenait parfois le fait de conduire des autobus scolaires. Il conduisait alors des autobus scolaires de la plus petite \u00e0 la plus grande taille, transportant de 20 \u00e0 60 enfants \u00e2g\u00e9s de 15 \u00e0 16 ans.\n[4] Le 8 janvier 2007, il terminait le transport du matin par autobus scolaire et, apr\u00e8s avoir laiss\u00e9 les enfants \u00e0 l'\u00e9cole, il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison pour d\u00eener. Soudainement, il a perdu sa vision dans son il droit, sans avertissement ou sympt\u00f4me. Il a communiqu\u00e9 avec les employ\u00e9s de Whitefish et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Il y a quelque chose qui ne va pas avec mon il... Trouvez quelqu'un d'autre... Je ne peux pas le faire... Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne conduirait plus jusqu'\u00e0 ce que sa vision revienne \u00e0 la normale.\n[5] Cleo Hunter \u00e9tait le superviseur de M. Breast. M. Hunter \u00e9tait responsable des travaux publics de Whitefish et il supervisait les conducteurs. Peu apr\u00e8s le 8 janvier 2007, lorsqu'il est devenu \u00e9vident que M. Breast ne reviendrait pas au travail dans un avenir proche, il a pris des mesures pour trouver un conducteur de rel\u00e8ve pour occuper le poste. M. Hunter a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Walter Houle et lui a demand\u00e9 de travailler comme conducteur de rel\u00e8ve pour le camion d'eau de fa\u00e7on temporaire. La livraison de l'eau est un service essentiel \u00e0 Whitefish. En d\u00e9cembre 2007, Walter Houle avait communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Hunter pour lui dire qu'il se portait volontaire comme conducteur de rel\u00e8ve pour Whitefish si n\u00e9cessaire. Walter Houle \u00e9tait le fr\u00e8re du chef \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, M. Tom Houle.\n[6] Au m\u00eame moment, M. Breast a communiqu\u00e9 avec son m\u00e9decin, qui l'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un sp\u00e9cialiste. Le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2007, M. Breast a rencontr\u00e9 le sp\u00e9cialiste. Ce dernier a confirm\u00e9 qu'il souffrait de paralysie du nerf oculomoteur caus\u00e9e par son diab\u00e8te. La paralysie du nerf oculomoteur caus\u00e9e par le diab\u00e8te est une complication du diab\u00e8te mal soign\u00e9. Il s'agit du trouble le plus commun des nerfs cr\u00e2niens chez les personnes souffrant de diab\u00e8te. Les patients se plaignent parfois de vision double qui appara\u00eet soudainement, de l'abaissement d'une paupi\u00e8re ou de douleur \u00e0 la t\u00eate ou derri\u00e8re l'il. Il n'existe aucun traitement pr\u00e9cis pour soigner la blessure au nerf. Le traitement principal consiste \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler de pr\u00e8s les niveaux de glyc\u00e9mie. Parfois, on applique un pansement oculaire. Bien que de nombreux patients voient une am\u00e9lioration avec le temps, certains souffrent de faiblesse permanente au muscle oculaire. Le sp\u00e9cialiste ne pouvait pas dire \u00e0 M. Breast \u00e0 quel moment son il gu\u00e9rirait. Le sp\u00e9cialiste lui a donn\u00e9 une note d'une seule ligne qui pr\u00e9cisait : [TRADUCTION] En raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, M. Breast ne peut pas conduire de v\u00e9hicule motoris\u00e9 . Il n'y avait aucune pr\u00e9cision au sujet de l'\u00e9tat exact de M. Breast ou au sujet de savoir s'il s'agissait d'un \u00e9tat temporaire ou permanent. La note \u00e9tait dat\u00e9e du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2007. M. Breast a donn\u00e9 cette note \u00e0 Whitefish, qui lui a alors accord\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 de maladie sans date pr\u00e9vue de retour.\n[7] Peu apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u cette note, M. Hunter a affich\u00e9 un avis pendant deux semaines au bureau de Whitefish, dans les deux magasins de Whitefish et au centre de sant\u00e9, demandant des candidats pour le poste de conducteur de camion d'eau. Il n'a re\u00e7u qu'une candidature, celle de Walter Houle. Comme Walter Houle avait fait du bon travail en tant que conducteur de camion d'eau temporaire, M. Hunter l'a embauch\u00e9. Il n'a pas consult\u00e9 le chef et le Conseil et il a pris cette d\u00e9cision lui-m\u00eame. Compte tenu du climat \u00e9conomique \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, Whitefish avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 embaucher et \u00e0 garder des conducteurs, que ce soit pour le camion d'eau ou le camion d'\u00e9gout. M. Hunter a avis\u00e9 le chef et le Conseil de l'embauche seulement apr\u00e8s qu'il eut embauch\u00e9 Walter Houle. Ni le chef ni le Conseil n'a dit \u00e0 M. Hunter d'embaucher Walter Houle.\n(ii) Billet m\u00e9dical exig\u00e9 pour le retour au travail [8] En avril 2007, M. Breast a recouvr\u00e9 sa vision. \u00c0 la fin d'avril 2007, M. Breast a dit \u00e0 M. Hunter qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 retourner au travail et M. Hunter lui a dit qu'il devait obtenir [TRADUCTION] l'accord du m\u00e9decin afin de prouver qu'il \u00e9tait en \u00e9tat de revenir au travail. M. Breast lui a dit qu'il ne pouvait pas fournir une telle note \u00e0 Whitefish parce qu'il avait eu recours \u00e0 un gu\u00e9risseur. M. Hunter lui a dit qu'il y avait une ouverture pour le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout et que cet emploi [TRADUCTION] lui \u00e9tait ouvert s'il obtenait un billet m\u00e9dical confirmant qu'il pouvait retourner au travail. Le salaire et les avantages du poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout et de celui de conducteur de camion d'eau sont les m\u00eames. Le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout comprenait la manutention d'eaux sanitaires et l'exposition occasionnelle \u00e0 des odeurs d\u00e9plaisantes.\n[9] M. Breast n'\u00e9tait pas satisfait de cette offre. Vers le 27 avril 2007, il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au chef Houle, qui au moment de l'audience \u00e9tait un conseiller de Whitefish. M. Breast lui a dit qu'il souhaitait retourner au travail et qu'il ne pouvait pas obtenir de billet m\u00e9dical parce qu'il voyait un gu\u00e9risseur. Le chef Houle lui a dit : [TRADUCTION] Charles, tu n'as pas besoin de lui dire que tu vois un gu\u00e9risseur. Tu peux subir un examen m\u00e9dical en tout temps. M. Breast a aussi dit au chef que M. Hunter lui avait offert le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout et qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] r\u00e9trograd\u00e9 . La r\u00e9ception t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du cellulaire \u00e9tait mauvaise pendant l'appel et, \u00e0 ce moment, la r\u00e9ception a \u00e9t\u00e9 coup\u00e9e. Le chef Houle est sorti et a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hunter. Le chef Houle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hunter de lui dire quel \u00e9tait l'\u00e9tat du poste de conducteur de camion d'eau parce qu'il [TRADUCTION] ne savait pas ce qui se passait . M. Hunter a dit au chef Houle que [TRADUCTION] nous avons affich\u00e9 le poste et que [TRADUCTION] Wally conduit le camion . Le chef Houle lui a demand\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Est ce qu'il y a un autre poste que nous pouvons donner \u00e0 Charles? M. Hunter lui a dit qu'il y avait effectivement une ouverture pour le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout, sous condition que M. Breast obtienne un billet m\u00e9dical. M. Hunter a mentionn\u00e9 que comme M. Breast avait pris un cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical, il devait fournir un billet m\u00e9dical pour retourner au travail.\n[10] Le m\u00eame jour, M. Breast a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 un certain nombre d'autres membres du Conseil pour essayer de retourner au travail sans fournir de billet m\u00e9dical. Il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au conseiller James Jackson (qui \u00e9tait chef au moment de la pr\u00e9sente audience). M. Jackson lui a dit de pr\u00e9senter quelque chose pour prouver qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] apte au travail . M. Breast lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il voyait un gu\u00e9risseur traditionnel. M. Jackson l'a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Hunter et \u00e0 M. Steinhauer, l'administrateur des ressources humaines de Whitefish, parce que le Conseil ne s'immis\u00e7ait pas dans les questions individuelles d'emploi. M. Breast a alors communiqu\u00e9 avec le conseiller Sandy Jackson au sujet des m\u00eames questions et lui a dit qu'il avait eu recours \u00e0 un gu\u00e9risseur. M. Sandy Jackson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il lui avait dit de pr\u00e9senter un billet m\u00e9dical pour pouvoir retourner au travail parce que [TRADUCTION] la Premi\u00e8re Nation demande un certificat m\u00e9dical .\n[11] Pendant son absence, M. Breast a subi des difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res personnelles. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le chef Houle s'est rendu au domicile de M. Breast pour essayer de l'aider. Le chef a communiqu\u00e9 avec un travailleur social pour lui demander de l'aide. Le travailleur social a dit au chef Houle qu'il avait suivi la politique en place et qu'il ne pouvait plus rien faire pour M. Breast. Le chef Houle a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Breast de l'argent, dans ses mots, [TRADUCTION] pour mettre de la nourriture sur la table .\n[12] \u00c0 un certain moment apr\u00e8s le 26 avril 2007, M. Breast a d\u00e9couvert que le poste de conducteur de camion d'eau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Walter Houle, mais il n'a pas soulev\u00e9 ce point aupr\u00e8s de Whitefish avant qu'il d\u00e9pose sa plainte en janvier 2008. M. Breast lui-m\u00eame \u00e9tait parent avec de nombreuses personnes dans la communaut\u00e9 de Whitefish, y compris au moins trois membres du Conseil en date de l'audience. Les employ\u00e9s de Whitefish \u00e9taient constitu\u00e9s d'environ 130 personnes, et bon nombre d'entre elles sont des membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Whitefish. De nombreux membres et employ\u00e9s sont parents avec d'autres membres ou employ\u00e9s, par les liens du sang ou du mariage.\n(iii) Contenu des documents m\u00e9dicaux requis pour le retour au travail [13] [13] \u00c0 la fin juillet, M. Breast a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Whitefish un billet m\u00e9dical dat\u00e9 du 27 juillet 2007, sign\u00e9 par son m\u00e9decin, qui expliquait en une phrase ce qui suit : [TRADUCTION] Cette lettre vise \u00e0 confirmer que M. Charles Breast est apte au travail depuis le 26 avril 2007 . Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, le 31 juillet 2007, Melvin Steinhauer a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Breast une lettre \u00e0 laquelle \u00e9tait annex\u00e9 un formulaire 17 intitul\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] Demande de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux . Le formulaire 17 demandait au m\u00e9decin de d\u00e9crire la nature de l'\u00e9tat de l'employ\u00e9. Le m\u00e9decin devait aussi d\u00e9crire tous les sympt\u00f4mes ou toutes les caract\u00e9ristiques de l'\u00e9tat qui pourraient nuire \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer ses t\u00e2ches r\u00e9guli\u00e8res ainsi qu'\u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter au travail de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Le formulaire demandait au m\u00e9decin de pr\u00e9ciser si les sympt\u00f4mes ou les caract\u00e9ristiques de l'\u00e9tat qui pouvaient nuire au rendement de l'employ\u00e9 ou \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sence de l'employ\u00e9 au travail pouvaient \u00eatre g\u00e9r\u00e9s ou contr\u00f4l\u00e9s ad\u00e9quatement par des m\u00e9dicaments, des traitements ou d'autres fa\u00e7ons, et le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, dans quelle mesure. On demandait au m\u00e9decin le pronostic de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9, \u00e0 savoir s'il s'agissait d'un \u00e9tat permanent ou temporaire, s'il \u00e9tait probable que cet \u00e9tat s'am\u00e9liore et en combien de temps. Le formulaire demandait si les sympt\u00f4mes de l'\u00e9tat pouvaient s'aggraver et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, de d\u00e9crire toute r\u00e9percussion pr\u00e9vue sur la capacit\u00e9 de l'employ\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer ses t\u00e2ches ou \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter au travail. Au haut du formulaire, le m\u00e9decin devait inscrire le titre du poste en question. Le formulaire demandait aussi l'avis du m\u00e9decin au sujet des mesures pr\u00e9cises (m\u00e9dicaments, traitements, adaptations en milieu de travail) qui permettraient \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 d'effectuer ad\u00e9quatement les t\u00e2ches essentielles du poste (y compris, mais sans s'y limiter, le maintien d'un niveau de pr\u00e9sence au travail qui permettrait \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 d'effectuer les t\u00e2ches essentielles). Enfin, on y demandait tout renseignement additionnel qui, selon l'avis du m\u00e9decin, pourrait aider \u00e0 tenter d'accommoder de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate l'employ\u00e9 en milieu de travail.\n[14] Dans la lettre d'accompagnement, M. Steinhauer demandait \u00e0 M. Breast de pr\u00e9senter le formulaire \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin avec une copie de la lettre, afin que Whitefish puisse obtenir les renseignements n\u00e9cessaires pour confirmer qu'il \u00e9tait apte au travail \u00e0 titre de conducteur. La lettre confirmait que cette demande \u00e9tait conforme aux nouvelles politiques en mati\u00e8re d'emploi r\u00e9cemment \u00e9tablies. M. Steinhauer confirmait aussi dans la lettre que lorsque Whitefish recevrait les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux du formulaire 17 prouvant son aptitude au travail, Whitefish rendrait \u00e0 M. Breast un emploi \u00e0 titre de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout, qui comportait le m\u00eame salaire et les m\u00eames avantages sociaux qu'il recevait avant son cong\u00e9.\n[15] Dans la m\u00eame lettre, M. Steinhauer a confirm\u00e9 que M. Breast avait avis\u00e9 Whitefish qu'il avait eu recours \u00e0 un gu\u00e9risseur et qu'il croyait \u00eatre \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 retourner au travail. La lettre pr\u00e9cisait que l'une des causes de son cong\u00e9 de maladie \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 maintenir son niveau de glyc\u00e9mie. \u00c0 ce sujet, Whitefish avait besoin de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires de son m\u00e9decin au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont ce probl\u00e8me \u00e9tait g\u00e9r\u00e9. Whitefish a confirm\u00e9 que le poste de conducteur \u00e9tait un poste o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est primordiale et que Whitefish devait garantir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Breast ainsi que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres et qu'elle devait g\u00e9rer toute responsabilit\u00e9 qui pouvait en d\u00e9couler.\n[16] Le 31 juillet 2007, Whitefish se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des politiques en mati\u00e8re d'emploi qui portaient sur les questions d'accommodement. Les politiques et le formulaire 17 ont officiellement \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par le Conseil de Whitefish le 31 ao\u00fbt 2007. Selon ces politiques, les employ\u00e9s avaient l'obligation de fournir \u00e0 Whitefish un avis raisonnable pour tout besoin d'accommodement. Les employ\u00e9s devaient aussi pr\u00e9senter un rapport de leur m\u00e9decin comprenant suffisamment de renseignements pertinents pour permettre \u00e0 Whitefish de v\u00e9rifier le besoin en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement. Dans la plupart des cas, un formulaire 17 de Demande de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux rempli \u00e9tait suffisant. Les employ\u00e9s devaient rencontrer l'administrateur des ressources humaines pour discuter des options d'accommodement et devaient participer \u00e0 ces discussions de bonne foi. Les politiques pr\u00e9cisaient que les employ\u00e9s devaient accepter un accommodement raisonnable.\n[17] Le 6 septembre 2007, M. Breast a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Alberta Driver Fitness un rapport m\u00e9dical confirmant que son diab\u00e8te \u00e9tait stable. Le 7 septembre 2007, Alberta Driver Fitness a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Breast pour l'aviser qu'elle approuvait qu'il continue \u00e0 conduire un camion, \u00e0 la condition qu'il soumette un rapport annuel au sujet de son diab\u00e8te et qu'il porte les verres correcteurs ad\u00e9quats. Cependant, M. Breast n'a pas donn\u00e9 cette lettre \u00e0 Whitefish.\n[18] Le 22 janvier 2008, M. Breast a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'avocat de Whitefish, apr\u00e8s cette date, a demand\u00e9 plusieurs fois \u00e0 M. Breast de pr\u00e9senter le formulaire 17 rempli. Le 26 juin 2008, Whitefish a de nouveau demand\u00e9 les renseignements et a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle tentait de travailler avec la Commission afin de r\u00e9soudre la plainte. M. Breast a vu son m\u00e9decin et a fait remplir le formulaire le 7 juillet 2008 pour le poste de conducteur . La Commission a ensuite transf\u00e9r\u00e9 le formulaire \u00e0 l'avocat de Whitefish le 10 juillet 2008. Le formulaire 17 confirmait que le diab\u00e8te de M. Breast \u00e9tait bien contr\u00f4l\u00e9, qu'il n'avait pas de sympt\u00f4mes persistants, que la paralysie du nerf oculomoteur s'\u00e9tait r\u00e9sorb\u00e9e et que sa vision \u00e9tait revenue. Le formulaire confirmait que la blessure au nerf \u00e9tait temporaire et que l'\u00e9tat de M. Breast ne devrait pas s'aggraver. Dans une des sections intitul\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] Accommodements , le formulaire demandait au m\u00e9decin de pr\u00e9ciser s'il fallait mettre en place des mesures pr\u00e9cise pour permettre \u00e0 M. Breast d'effectuer les t\u00e2ches essentielles de son travail et le m\u00e9decin a inscrit qu'aucune mesure n'\u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire.\n[19] Le 16 juillet 2008, Whitefish a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Breast pour accuser r\u00e9ception du formulaire 17. Elle a aussi confirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait re\u00e7u une copie de la lettre d'Alberta Driver Fitness qui approuvait sous condition qu'il continue de travailler comme conducteur de v\u00e9hicule motoris\u00e9. Compte tenu de ces renseignements, Whitefish a offert \u00e0 M. Breast le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout sous quatre conditions. M. Breast devait :\ncontr\u00f4ler son niveau de glyc\u00e9mie \u00e0 tous les jours et au moins toutes les quatre heures lorsqu'il travaillait; ne pas conduire si son niveau de glyc\u00e9mie \u00e9tait bas et aviser imm\u00e9diatement son superviseur de toute situation d'hypoglyc\u00e9mie; garder de la nourriture d'urgence dans son camion en tout temps; fournir le rapport annuel sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et son diab\u00e8te requis par Alberta Driver Fitness \u00e0 titre de condition pour qu'il puisse garder son permis de conducteur de camion.\nDans la lettre se trouvait ensuite un paragraphe o\u00f9 M. Breast devait signer, indiquant ainsi qu'il acceptait les conditions de la lettre et acceptait de reprendre le travail en fonction de ces conditions.\n[20] M. Breast a discut\u00e9 de la lettre avec sa femme. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne voyait pas de probl\u00e8me avec ces conditions, puisqu'il contr\u00f4lait d\u00e9j\u00e0 son taux de glyc\u00e9mie deux fois par jour et qu'il ne conduirait pas si son taux de glyc\u00e9mie \u00e9tait bas. De plus, il apportait toujours son go\u00fbter avec lui et il respectait les conditions d'Alberta Driver Fitness. Mme Breast a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait implor\u00e9 son mari : [TRADUCTION] Prends l'emploi [...] regarde comment nous vivons.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 la fin juillet 2008, M. Breast et son \u00e9pouse ont rencontr\u00e9 Melvin Steinhauer afin de discuter du retour au travail de M. Breast. Cependant, lorsque ce dernier a rencontr\u00e9 M. Steinhauer dans son bureau, il lui a dit que Whitefish n'avait pas le droit de lui imposer des conditions m\u00e9dicales puisque seul son m\u00e9decin pouvait lui dire quoi faire. M. Breast lui a dit qu'il ne voulait pas du poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout et il a refus\u00e9 de signer la lettre d'acceptation de poste. M. Steinhauer \u00e9tait m\u00e9content parce qu'il avait esp\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Breast \u00e9tait venu le rencontrer pour accepter le poste et les conditions. M. Breast s'est aussi f\u00e2ch\u00e9. M. Steinhauer a point\u00e9 M. Breast du doigt et a secou\u00e9 son doigt en lui disant de se calmer. M. Steinhauer a alors dit merci \u00e0 Mme Breast et le couple a quitt\u00e9 son bureau.\n[22] M. Breast n'a jamais sign\u00e9 la lettre acceptant le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout sous les conditions pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es.\n[23] \u00c0 la fin ao\u00fbt 2008, M. Breast a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu du Code canadien du travail, dans laquelle il soutenait qu'il n'avait pas re\u00e7u d'indemnit\u00e9 de d\u00e9part ni d'indemnit\u00e9 de fin d'emploi de Whitefish, comme le Code l'exigeait.\nB. Les faits non contest\u00e9s et l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice [24] Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une active gestion pr\u00e9paratoire \u00e0 l'audience et une exploration des questions avec les avocats au d\u00e9but de l'audience, les avocats ont convenu d'un certain nombre de faits. De plus, les questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ramen\u00e9es \u00e0 quelques questions distinctes. Les conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires \u00e0 l'audience ont permis de raccourcir \u00e0 une semaine une affaire qui aurait dur\u00e9 au moins deux semaines. L'entente sur les faits et la pr\u00e9cision des questions lors de l'instruction a aussi permis d'acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l'audience, qui a dur\u00e9 deux jours plut\u00f4t que les cinq jours pr\u00e9vus. De plus, la preuve m\u00e9dicale du m\u00e9decin de famille de M. Breast et de son sp\u00e9cialiste ainsi que celle de l'expert de Whitefish, le Dr Francescutti, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sans que des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner soient envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 ces m\u00e9decins, ce qui a aussi \u00e9conomis\u00e9 des frais aux parties, qui auraient probablement eu \u00e0 couvrir les frais n\u00e9cessaires pour que les m\u00e9decins t\u00e9moignent. La preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu et les parties ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur droit respectif de contre interroger les m\u00e9decins \u00e0 ce sujet. En restreignant les questions \u00e0 celles contest\u00e9es, les parties ont accept\u00e9 de r\u00e9duire le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins et les arguments.\n[25] De plus, du d\u00e9but de l'audience jusqu'\u00e0 la conclusion, j'ai encourag\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 s'entendre \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'audience, puisque la plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un membre de la Premi\u00e8re Nation contre sa Premi\u00e8re Nation. Malheureusement, les parties ne sont pas parvenues \u00e0 une entente. Cependant, je reconnais que les deux avocats ont tent\u00e9 de faciliter une entente tout au long de l'audience, et je les en remercie.\nC. D\u00e9saccord au sujet des questions de fait [26] En arrivant aux conclusions de fait ci-dessous, j'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement toute la preuve. Il y avait des divergences entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Breast et celui des t\u00e9moins de Whitefish, ainsi que dans la preuve documentaire. Lorsqu'il y avait divergence entre la preuve de M. Breast et les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, j'ai choisi d'accepter les autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour les raisons suivantes :\n[27] M. Breast a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait pas bien des \u00e9v\u00e9nements importants. Il \u00e9tait incapable d'expliquer les divergences dans les dates et les heures, y compris celles qui faisaient partie de sa plainte. Par exemple, sa plainte est dat\u00e9e du 22 janvier 2008; pourtant, elle porte sur un \u00e9v\u00e9nement qui a eu lieu apr\u00e8s cette date. La plainte pr\u00e9cise que M. Breast a apport\u00e9 le formulaire 17 \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin. En fait, M. Breast a apport\u00e9 le formulaire \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin vers le 7 juillet 2008 et le m\u00e9decin l'a rempli le 7 juillet 2008, soit six mois apr\u00e8s que la plainte eut \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Un autre exemple encore plus pertinent se trouve dans la plainte, o\u00f9 M. Breast d\u00e9clare que [TRADUCTION] mon cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical n'a rien \u00e0 voir avec mon diab\u00e8te , soutenant plut\u00f4t qu'il avait pris cong\u00e9 en raison d'une infection \u00e0 son il gauche. Cette d\u00e9claration affecte de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, puisque M. Breast savait, au moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte, que son probl\u00e8me \u00e0 l'il \u00e9tait une paralysie du nerf oculomoteur caus\u00e9e par son diab\u00e8te. \u00c0 la premi\u00e8re page de son formulaire de plainte, M. Breast a inscrit ses initiales \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la d\u00e9claration suivante : [TRADUCTION] J'ai de bons motifs de croire que j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. Je d\u00e9clare que les renseignements suivants contenus dans ma plainte sont vrais au meilleur de ma connaissance.\n[28] M. Breast a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas avis\u00e9 Whitefish qu'il avait eu recours \u00e0 un gu\u00e9risseur. Ce t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par celui du chef Houle, de James Jackson et de Sandy Jackson. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par la lettre de M. Steinhauer, dat\u00e9e du 31 juillet 2007, dont la justesse n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par M. Breast lorsqu'il l'a re\u00e7ue ni lors de l'audience. De plus, une conclusion selon laquelle il a bel et bien avis\u00e9 Whitefish qu'il avait eu recours \u00e0 un gu\u00e9risseur est raisonnable et coh\u00e9rente compte tenu des autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Elle explique la premi\u00e8re raison pour laquelle M. Breast n'a pas fourni \u00e0 Whitefish un billet m\u00e9dical d'avril 2007 \u00e0 juillet 2007 pour son retour au travail et pourquoi son billet m\u00e9dical du 27 juillet 2007 confirmait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 apte au travail depuis le 26 avril 2007. Au d\u00e9part, M. Breast ne croyait pas qu'il pourrait obtenir un billet m\u00e9dical.\n[29] M. Breast a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait pas si le formulaire 17 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annex\u00e9 \u00e0 la lettre du 31 juillet 2007 envoy\u00e9e par M. Steinhauer. Compte tenu du libell\u00e9 clair de la lettre et du t\u00e9moignage des autres t\u00e9moins, j'accepte que le formulaire 17 \u00e9tait annex\u00e9 \u00e0 cette lettre. Je conclus que M. Breast a \u00e9t\u00e9 inexplicablement \u00e9vasif au sujet de questions importantes \u00e0 l'audience.\n[30] En ce qui a trait aux all\u00e9gations de M. Breast selon lesquelles, pendant la r\u00e9union de juillet 2008, M. Steinhauer l'aurait frapp\u00e9 agressivement trois fois sur le front avec son doigt, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Breast plut\u00f4t que celui de son \u00e9poux, puisque j'ai conclu que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait plus cr\u00e9dible que celui de M. Breast. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en sa faveur et elle aurait pu exag\u00e9rer son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'avantage de son mari, mais elle ne l'a pas fait. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Steinhauer a secou\u00e9 son doigt devant M. Breast.\n[31] Je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re aussi le t\u00e9moignage du chef Houle \u00e0 celui de M. Breast. J'ai conclu que le chef Houle est un t\u00e9moin largement impartial et une personne qui a fait preuve, et qui fait encore preuve, de sympathie envers M. Breast. Il n'a montr\u00e9 aucune malveillance envers M. Breast. Il a tent\u00e9 de l'aider et lui a dit de ne pas s'inqui\u00e9ter du fait qu'il n'avait pas vu de m\u00e9decin; qu'il pouvait obtenir un billet m\u00e9dical, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s le fait, pour retourner au travail. Le chef Houle a communiqu\u00e9 avec les employ\u00e9s de Whitefish pour se renseigner au sujet de l'\u00e9tat du poste de conducteur de camion d'eau et pour savoir s'il existait d'autres possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi pour M. Breast. Le chef Houle a rendu visite \u00e0 M. Breast \u00e0 son domicile pour lui pr\u00eater assistance et il l'a aid\u00e9 financi\u00e8rement et a tent\u00e9 de convaincre un travailleur social de l'aider. Je conclus que le chef Houle \u00e9tait franc et direct et qu'il avait fait preuve d'une empathie sinc\u00e8re envers M. Breast lorsqu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lui aussi avait conduit un camion, qu'il \u00e9tait aussi diab\u00e9tique et qu'il devait se soumettre \u00e0 des examens m\u00e9dicaux annuels. Par cons\u00e9quent, j'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hunter et celui du chef Houle selon lequel le chef et le Conseil ne participaient pas aux d\u00e9cisions individuelles en mati\u00e8re d'emploi et que le chef ne savait pas, en avril 2007, que son fr\u00e8re conduisait le camion d'eau de fa\u00e7on permanente \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0.\n[32] Finalement, je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hunter \u00e0 celui de M. Breast, parce que M. Hunter a \u00e9t\u00e9 direct et franc, m\u00eame lorsque son t\u00e9moignage pouvait \u00eatre vu comme n\u00e9gatif pour Whitefish. Par exemple, en contre-interrogatoire, on lui a demand\u00e9 s'il \u00e9tait au courant de l'existence du formulaire 17 en avril 2007. Il a franchement r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne connaissait pas le formulaire 17 \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, ou subs\u00e9quemment, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que l'avocat de Whitefish lui en parle en pr\u00e9paration pour l'audience. Il a aussi reconnu que d'autres conducteurs diab\u00e9tiques n'avaient pas eu \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter de formulaire 17, bien qu'il n'ait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 quel moment c'\u00e9tait le cas et si d'autres employ\u00e9s avaient pris un cong\u00e9 m\u00e9dical apr\u00e8s juillet 2007. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien qu'il aurait pu s'agir d'un t\u00e9moignage dommageable pour l'intim\u00e9e, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Breast \u00e9tait le premier employ\u00e9 \u00e0 recevoir un formulaire 17, pr\u00e8s de la date o\u00f9 le formulaire est entr\u00e9 en vigueur en juillet 2007. Il n'existe pas suffisamment d'autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 savoir si d'autres employ\u00e9s, diab\u00e9tiques ou non, avaient pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie et avaient tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail et auraient donc eu \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter un formulaire 17.\nIII. III LE DROIT A. \u00c9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination [33] L'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP ) dispose que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu ou de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi. La d\u00e9ficience fait partie des motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9tablis \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP. Selon l'article 25, d\u00e9ficience , aux fins de l'application de la LCDP, signifie [...] d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu'elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l'alcool ou la drogue . La situation de famille constitue \u00e9galement un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l'article 3.\n[34] Dans une affaire portant sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en compte dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Voir Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, et Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204.) Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les affirmations du plaignant doivent \u00eatre cr\u00e9dibles pour qu'on autorise la conclusion selon laquelle il existait une preuve prima facie (Dhanjal c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (1997), 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6). Lorsqu'on examine une action, plut\u00f4t qu'une politique existante, il faut commencer par examiner si les rapports entre les parties, dans son ensemble, entra\u00eene un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur des motifs de distinction illicites (Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l'Environnement) (C.A.), 2003 CAF 133, [2003] 4 C.F. 580).\nB. D\u00e9fenses [35] Une fois que la preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau incombe par la suite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable \u00e9tablissant que l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne s'est pas produit tel qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l'acte \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9. (Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 4; LCDP, article 15; voir aussi Canada c. Lambie, 1996 CanLii 3940 (C.F.).) Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l'unique raison de l'acte reproch\u00e9 pour qu'une plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que la discrimination ne soit que l'une des raisons de l'acte ou de la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur. (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.).)\n[36] Si l'intim\u00e9 souhaite se pr\u00e9valoir de la justification de bonne foi portant sur l'exigence occupationnelle, il doit \u00e9tablir qu'il a satisfait \u00e0 son devoir d'accommodement jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive, au sens de l'article 15 de la LCDP. La recherche de mesures d'accommodement fait intervenir plusieurs parties et, dans le cas d'une d\u00e9ficience, le plaignant doit faciliter la recherche d'une mesure d'accommodement en se conformant aux demandes raisonnables de l'employeur de fournir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents au sujet de ses limites, afin de permettre \u00e0 l'employeur de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une proposition (Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 TCDP 8; Graham c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 40, aux paragraphes 91 \u00e0 94). Il est de jurisprudence constante qu'un employ\u00e9 ne peut pas dicter \u00e0 l'employeur les termes pr\u00e9cis d'un accommodement. Voir, par exemple, Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4. Au paragraphe 22 de cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame a not\u00e9 que l'accommodement n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement une voie \u00e0 sens unique et que, lorsque l'employeur fait une proposition raisonnable, l'employ\u00e9 a le devoir de faciliter l'application de la mesure d'accommodement. Si l'absence de coop\u00e9ration de l'employ\u00e9 est \u00e0 l'origine de l'\u00e9chec du processus d'accommodement, sa plainte pourra \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Le plaignant ne peut s'attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite. (Voir \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision Hutchinson, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 77.) Il n'existe aucune obligation d'accommodement instantan\u00e9 ou parfait, seulement un accommodement raisonnable. Le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l'accommodement de l'employeur doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 en fonction de la connaissance de l'employeur ainsi que du co\u00fbt, de la complexit\u00e9 et des d\u00e9penses de tout accommodement physique requis, et d'autres facteurs semblables. (Voir Callan c. Suncor Inc., 2006 ABCA 15, au paragraphe 21.)\nC. La preuve [37] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir des all\u00e9gations de discrimination au moyen d'une preuve directe. Comme le Tribunal l'a not\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), la discrimination n'est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu'on puisse d\u00e9montrer par des preuves directes qu'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement. On doit plut\u00f4t tenir compte de l'ensemble des circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il existe de subtiles odeurs de discrimination. Essentiellement, cependant, le plaignant doit \u00e9tablir un lien entre sa d\u00e9ficience, ou sa situation de famille, et la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur de le cong\u00e9dier (Mills c. Culp Transport Inc. 2009 TCDP 17). (Voir aussi Benoit c. Bell Canada, 2005 CF 926, aux paragraphes 15 et 16.)\nIV. ANALYSE A. Situation de famille (i) Traitement diff\u00e9rent pr\u00e9judiciable en milieu de travail a) Aucune preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie et explication raisonnable fournie [38] Au d\u00e9part, M. Breast a soutenu que son poste de conducteur de camion d'eau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au fr\u00e8re du chef en raison de cette relation fraternelle. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Breast a soutenu qu'il avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette affirmation. Sauf pour les arguments du plaignant, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e permettant de croire que la relation de Walter Houle avec le chef \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque \u00e9tait un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision initiale de l'embaucher comme conducteur de rel\u00e8ve; ni qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente de l'embaucher comme conducteur permanent du camion d'eau. De plus, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que M. Breast lui-m\u00eame \u00e9tait li\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses personnes dans la communaut\u00e9 de Whitefish, y compris au moins trois membres du Conseil. Alors qu'au d\u00e9part, M. Breast supposait que Walter Houle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 sans suivre le processus \u00e9tabli, ses suppositions n'\u00e9taient pas suffisantes pour \u00e9tablir que c'\u00e9tait bien le cas. Suivant la d\u00e9cision McAdam c. Big River First Nation, 2009 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 47, un plaignant ne peut pas simplement pr\u00e9senter ses croyances abstraites ou ses soup\u00e7ons quant au fait qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination, sans pr\u00e9senter des observations concr\u00e8tes ou des renseignements ind\u00e9pendants pour appuyer ou confirmer cette croyance. (Voir aussi Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 CF 785, aux paragraphes 30 et 31.)\n[39] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Breast n'\u00e9tait pas compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie pour ce motif (O'Malley).\n[40] De plus, m\u00eame s'il avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie, \u00e0 la fin de l'audience, l'avocat de M. Breast, M. Stolfa, a accept\u00e9 dans son argument que Whitefish avait \u00e9tabli une explication raisonnable qui n'\u00e9tait pas un pr\u00e9texte pour l'embauche du fr\u00e8re du chef. Le poste de conducteur de camion d'eau \u00e9tait un service essentiel; Whitefish devait combler le poste imm\u00e9diatement. De plus, apr\u00e8s que Walter Houle eut combl\u00e9 le poste \u00e0 titre de conducteur de rel\u00e8ve pendant une p\u00e9riode de deux semaines, l'affiche de Whitefish demandant des candidats pour le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e dans les bureaux de Whitefish, et Whitefish n'a re\u00e7u que la candidature de Walter Houle pour le poste. Le chef et le Conseil n'ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'embaucher Walter Houle de fa\u00e7on temporaire, puis de fa\u00e7on permanente. En effet, Whitefish avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 embaucher et \u00e0 garder des conducteurs, que ce soit pour le camion d'eau ou le camion d'\u00e9gout.\nB. D\u00e9ficience (i) Traitement d\u00e9favorable a) Preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie [41] M. Breast \u00e9tait atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience, soit le diab\u00e8te, et son retour au travail reposait sur des preuves m\u00e9dicales portant sur l'accommodement de sa d\u00e9ficience. Une manifestation particuli\u00e8re de sa d\u00e9ficience, soit le diagnostic de paralysie du nerf oculomoteur caus\u00e9e par le diab\u00e8te, a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de Whitefish au sujet de son retour au travail. Je conclus donc que M. Breast a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\nb) M. Breast n'a pas facilit\u00e9 le processus d'accommodement (ii) Les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux [42] L'exigence de Whitefish que M. Breast obtienne des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux au sujet de ses incapacit\u00e9s et de ses limites qui pouvaient affecter sa capacit\u00e9 d'effectuer son travail de conducteur \u00e9tait une demande raisonnable et coh\u00e9rente par rapport \u00e0 son obligation d'accommodement et, en particulier, \u00e0 son obligation de garantir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de M. Breast \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des autres membres de la communaut\u00e9 de Whitefish. Le billet m\u00e9dical d'une phrase que M. Breast a fourni \u00e0 Whitefish ne comprenait pas suffisamment de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pour permettre \u00e0 Whitefish d'\u00e9tablir une proposition viable d'accommodement. Compte tenu des circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce, M. Breast avait le devoir d'aviser ad\u00e9quatement Whitefish de ses capacit\u00e9s et de ses limites physiques - une obligation qu'il n'a pas respect\u00e9e.\n[43] L'accommodation est une voie bilat\u00e9rale et, en l'esp\u00e8ce, je conclus que M. Breast n'a pas satisfait \u00e0 son obligation de coop\u00e9rer au processus d'accommodement. Il n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux n\u00e9cessaires de juillet 2007 jusqu'\u00e0 juillet 2008. C'est la Commission, en juillet 2008, qui a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux du formulaire 17 \u00e0 Whitefish. D\u00e8s lors, Whitefish a propos\u00e9 un plan d'accommodement qui, selon son propre t\u00e9moignage, convenait \u00e0 M. Breast, puisqu'il respectait d\u00e9j\u00e0 les pratiques propos\u00e9es lorsqu'il conduisait son propre camion tous les jours. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il contr\u00f4lait son taux de glyc\u00e9mie deux fois par jour, qu'il gardait un go\u00fbter avec lui, qu'il respectait les exigences de l'Alberta Driver Fitness pour son permis de conducteur et qu'il ne conduirait pas s'il avait des probl\u00e8mes d'hypoglyc\u00e9mie. Le plan d'accommodement \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 l'avis du m\u00e9decin expert de Whitefish qui se sp\u00e9cialise en m\u00e9decine communautaire. Son rapport confirmait que le plan de retour au travail de Whitefish pour M. Breast, dans un environnement non supervis\u00e9, respectait les guides de l'Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne et de l'Association canadienne du diab\u00e8te pour les conducteurs diab\u00e9tiques.\n[44] Il convient de noter qu'en date de l'audience, M. Breast refusait toujours de signer l'offre conditionnelle de juillet 2008 pour son retour au travail, ce qui d\u00e9montre qu'il refusait toujours de coop\u00e9rer avec les demandes raisonnables de Whitefish et d'accepter le poste de conducteur du camion d'\u00e9gout. En l'esp\u00e8ce, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans l'affaire Tweten, M. Breast n'a pas particip\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on ad\u00e9quate \u00e0 la recherche d'accommodements et il ne s'est nullement engag\u00e9 sur une voie bilat\u00e9rale .\n[45] J'ai examin\u00e9 si l'exigence du formulaire 17 pour le retour au travail avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on arbitraire et je conclus qu'il n'y a pas suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour appuyer une telle all\u00e9gation, c'est-\u00e0-dire que je ne peux pas conclure, en fonction de la preuve, si d'autres employ\u00e9s, diab\u00e9tiques ou non, avaient eu un cong\u00e9 de maladie et avaient tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail et aurait donc d\u00fb pr\u00e9senter un formulaire 17, mais on ne leur a pas demand\u00e9. Bien que certains t\u00e9moins aient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Breast \u00e9tait la seule personne qui avait eu \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter un formulaire 17 et qu'ils avaient eux-m\u00eames une connaissance limit\u00e9e, ou aucune connaissance, au sujet du formulaire 17, on ne m'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 suffisamment d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la situation des autres membres qui ont quitt\u00e9 leur poste au sein de Whitefish pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et qui seraient retourn\u00e9s au travail apr\u00e8s le 31 juillet 2007.\na) Whitefish a offert une mesure d'accommodement raisonnable - le poste substitut vacant de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout [46] M. Breast m'a demand\u00e9 de conclure que l'offre de Whitefish de lui donner le poste vacant de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable parce que, \u00e0 son avis, il s'agissait d'un emploi de statut moindre et comprenait l'exposition occasionnelle \u00e0 un environnement o\u00f9 il r\u00e9gnait une mauvaise odeur. Il a soutenu que Whitefish lui avait offert cet emploi de mauvaise foi, croyant qu'il ne l'accepterait pas. Ses arguments \u00e9taient difficiles \u00e0 suivre, parce qu'il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait [TRADUCTION] jamais eu de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 accepter le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout. Lorsque son avocat lui a demand\u00e9 si le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout \u00e9tait de statut moindre, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de le confirmer. De plus, \u00e0 l'audience, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre r\u00e9tabli dans le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout. Comme les deux postes de conducteur de camion comportaient le m\u00eame revenu et les m\u00eames avantages sociaux, m\u00eame si le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout comprenait occasionnellement des mauvaises odeurs, je conclus, compte tenu de la preuve dont je suis saisi, que Whitefish a fourni un plan d'accommodement raisonnable pour accommoder la d\u00e9ficience de M. Breast. Dans les circonstances, son refus d'accepter le poste vacant de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout au lieu de son poste de conducteur de camion d'eau n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnable et il ne pouvait pas continuer \u00e0 revendiquer son emploi pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9. Il n'a pas facilit\u00e9 le processus d'accommodement.\n(iii) Licenciement a) Aucune preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie [47] M. Breast a soutenu qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9guis\u00e9e de son poste : \u00e0 la suite de sa rencontre avec Melvin Steinhauer \u00e0 la fin juillet 2008, le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout, tel qu'offert dans la lettre de Whitefish du 16 juillet 2008, ne lui \u00e9tait plus offert. M. Breast a soutenu que malgr\u00e9 le libell\u00e9 clair de la lettre, lorsque M. Steinhauer l'aurait cens\u00e9ment frapp\u00e9 sur le front avec son doigt, cela constituait une communication non verbale selon laquelle le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout n'\u00e9tait pas offert \u00e0 M. Breast et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas le bienvenu au travail. Je n'accepte pas cet argument, comme j'ai conclu pour les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents que M. Steinhauer a simplement point\u00e9 et secou\u00e9 son doigt vers M. Breast. J'ai aussi conclu que le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout \u00e9tait offert \u00e0 M. Breast d\u00e8s le printemps 2007, jusqu'\u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente audience, peu importent les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s lors de la rencontre de juillet 2008; plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Breast pouvait, du printemps 2007 jusqu'\u00e0 l'audience, communiquer \u00e0 Whitefish qu'il souhaitait accepter le poste de conducteur de camion d'\u00e9gout. \u00c0 partir du 16 juillet 2008, il n'avait qu'\u00e0 signer l'offre officielle de Whitefish et \u00e0 la renvoyer au bureau de Whitefish. Depuis qu'il a re\u00e7u la lettre d'offre, M. Breast ne l'a pas accept\u00e9e. Je conclus qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 par Whitefish, de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9guis\u00e9e ou autrement.\n[48] L'avocat de Whitefish a soutenu que la d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9liminaire de la conformit\u00e9 par un inspecteur au sujet de la plainte de M. Breast pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu du Code canadien du travail d\u00e9montrait qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9guis\u00e9e. Cependant, pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente affaire, je n'accorde aucun poids \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination pr\u00e9liminaire de l'inspecteur du Code canadien du travail.\nV. D\u00c9CISION [49] Pour ces motifs, je rejette la plainte puisqu'elle n'est pas fond\u00e9e. J'ai examin\u00e9 la preuve, tant chacun de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments que l'ensemble qu'ils forment collectivement, et je n'y ai relev\u00e9 aucune discrimination au sens de l'article 7 de la LCDP.\nSign\u00e9e par Shirish P.

Conclusion\n[1] Les plaignants ont tous \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 un moment ou \u00e0 un autre, employ\u00e9s par la Commission des relations de travail dans la Fonction publique (la CRTFP), agence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique le 1er avril 2005. Le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada (le CT) est l'employeur de la plupart des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, mais depuis 1968, la CRTFP a agi \u00e0 titre d'employeur distinct .\n[2] En 1999, le CT a convenu d'effectuer des paiements aux employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale relevant notamment des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles Commis aux \u00e9critures et aux r\u00e8glements (CR), Biblioth\u00e9conomie (LS), Secr\u00e9tariat, st\u00e9nographie et dactylographie (ST), Gestion du personnel (PE) et Traitement m\u00e9canique - Conversion des donn\u00e9es (DA-CON). Ces paiements ont fait suite \u00e0 plusieurs plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) entre 1984 et 1991. Les plaignants all\u00e9guaient que l'employeur pratiquait la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutaient, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, ce qui constitue un acte discriminatoire aux termes de l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), couramment appel\u00e9 disposition relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale.\n[3] Les plaignants affirment avoir occup\u00e9 \u00e0 la CRTFP des postes relevant des m\u00eames cat\u00e9gories professionnelles que celles dont il \u00e9tait question dans les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l'article 11. Toutefois, les plaignants n'ont pas re\u00e7u les m\u00eames paiements au titre de la parit\u00e9 salariale, autrement dit les sommes correspondant aux salaires qui leur \u00e9taient dus r\u00e9troactivement pour la p\u00e9riode comprise entre 1985 et 1999. Les plaignants pr\u00e9tendent qu'en leur refusant ces paiements, la CRTFP et le CT ont fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, en violation des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP.\n[4] Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, je pr\u00e9senterai d'abord le contexte factuel, d\u00e9crivant comment la CRTFP a acquis le statut d'employeur distinct. J'expliquerai ensuite comment des employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale ont eu droit \u00e0 un certain nombre de rajustements au titre de la parit\u00e9 salariale au fil des ann\u00e9es, rajustements qui ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP, \u00e0 l'exception notable des paiements r\u00e9troactifs susmentionn\u00e9s, effectu\u00e9s entre 1985 et 1999, lesquels sont \u00e0 l'origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Au terme de mon analyse, je conclurai que la plainte n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e.\nI. Le contexte factuel [5] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits exhaustif d'o\u00f9 sont extraits la plupart des faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nA. La fondation de la CRTFP et sa relation avec le CT [6] Pour comprendre les faits ayant conduit au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il est important de consid\u00e9rer l'histoire organisationnelle de la CRTFP ainsi que la relation de cette derni\u00e8re avec le CT.\n[7] Institu\u00e9e en 1967, avec l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-35 (la LRTFP), la CRTFP devait agir comme tribunal quasi judiciaire ind\u00e9pendant charg\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur d'administrer les syst\u00e8mes de n\u00e9gociation collective et d'arbitrage des griefs au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. En application de la Loi sur les relations de travail au Parlement, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 33 (2e suppl.), la CRTFP a re\u00e7u un mandat similaire en ce qui a trait aux employ\u00e9s des institutions parlementaires. En 2005, la LRTFP a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9e et la CRTFP a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9e par la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique, en application de la Loi sur les relations de travail dans la fonction publique, L.C. 2003, ch. 22, art. 2.\n[8] Le financement de la CRTFP provenait de cr\u00e9dits parlementaires vers\u00e9s par le CT. Le CT est un comit\u00e9 du Conseil priv\u00e9 de la Reine (un comit\u00e9 du cabinet) institu\u00e9 par l'article 5 de la Loi sur la gestion des finances publiques, L.R.C. 1985, ch. F-11 (la LGFP). Il est constitu\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sident du CT, du ministre des Finances et de quatre autres membres du Conseil priv\u00e9 de la Reine pour le Canada. Le Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (le SCT), organisme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral constitu\u00e9 d'un secr\u00e9taire nomm\u00e9 par le gouverneur en conseil ainsi que de dirigeants et d'employ\u00e9s, pr\u00eate assistance au CT.\n[9] Le CT \u00e9tait responsable de la gestion du personnel des minist\u00e8res, agences, tribunaux administratifs et commissions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie I de l'annexe I de la LRTFP, qu'on appelle couramment la fonction publique centrale . Cette liste \u00e9tait longue et incluait par exemple, d\u00e8s 1984, des organismes tels que le Bureau du conseil priv\u00e9, Statistiques Canada, la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles et la CCDP. Les pouvoirs du CT relatifs \u00e0 la gestion du personnel \u00e9taient \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 11(2) de la LGFP et comprenaient la classification des postes et l'\u00e9tablissement des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, des horaires et du droit aux cong\u00e9s.\n[10] La comp\u00e9tence du CT en mati\u00e8re de gestion du personnel ne s'\u00e9tendait pas au personnel des agences, commissions et tribunaux \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie II de l'annexe I de la LRTFP, qui ont le statut d'employeurs distincts . Aux termes du paragraphe 11(2) de la LGFP, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor devait exercer ses pouvoirs relatifs \u00e0 la gestion du personnel sous r\u00e9serve des seules dispositions de tout texte l\u00e9gislatif concernant les pouvoirs et fonctions d'un employeur distinct . Le groupe d'employeurs distincts comprenait notamment l'Office national du film, la Commission de contr\u00f4le de l'\u00e9nergie atomique, le Bureau du v\u00e9rificateur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et, ce qui est particuli\u00e8rement pertinent en l'esp\u00e8ce, la CRTFP.\n[11] Aux termes du paragraphe 12(2) de la LGFP, le gouverneur en conseil pouvait d\u00e9l\u00e9guer les pouvoirs relatifs \u00e0 la gestion du personnel des employeurs distincts au ministre, au sous-ministre ou au premier dirigeant de l'employeur distinct.\nB. Comment la CRTFP est-elle devenue un employeur distinct? [12] Dans l'ann\u00e9e qui a suivi sa fondation en 1967, la CRTFP a fait partie de la fonction publique centrale. Ainsi, le CT \u00e9tait responsable de la gestion de son personnel, y compris de la classification des postes et de l'\u00e9tablissement des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, des horaires et du droit aux cong\u00e9s.\n[13] Le 8 juillet 1968, le pr\u00e9sident de la CRTFP, Jacob Finkelman, a \u00e9crit au CT pour lui demander d'exclure la CRTFP du champ d'application des pouvoirs du CT en mati\u00e8re de gestion de personnel. M. Finkelman a soulign\u00e9 que certaines parties qui avaient comparu devant la CRTFP avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 remettre en question l'ind\u00e9pendance et l'objectivit\u00e9 de l'organisme, consid\u00e9rant que le CT \u00e9tait le principal employeur tombant sous la juridiction de la CRTFP. Prenant acte de ces pr\u00e9occupations, le SCT a propos\u00e9, en guise de solution de rechange \u00e0 l'exclusion totale demand\u00e9e par M. Finkelman, que la CRTFP devienne un employeur distinct. Cette proposition s'est finalement concr\u00e9tis\u00e9e, et le 28 octobre 1968, le gouverneur en conseil a accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la CRTFP le statut d'employeur distinct au sens de la LRTFP (P.C. 1908-2302), en application de l'article 5, autorisant son pr\u00e9sident (P.C. 1968-18\/1998) \u00e0 exercer les pouvoirs et fonctions du CT \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de ses employ\u00e9s, et ce, \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 1968, en application du paragraphe 12(2) de la LGFP.\n[14] Bien que la CRTFP ait acquis le statut d'employeur distinct, sa situation en ce qui concerne les relations de travail \u00e9tait \u00e0 certains \u00e9gards diff\u00e9rente de celle d'autres employeurs distincts. En application de la LRTFP, les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP \u00e9taient exclus des n\u00e9gociations collectives. Par cons\u00e9quent, tandis que d'autres employeurs distincts n\u00e9gociaient leurs taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration avec les agents n\u00e9gociateurs de leurs employ\u00e9s, la CRTFP pouvait \u00e9tablir unilat\u00e9ralement les conditions d'emploi, y compris les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Par cons\u00e9quent, par les pouvoirs qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par voie de d\u00e9cret en vue d'exercer les fonctions et attributions du CT, M. Finkelman a simplement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les conditions d'emploi de la fonction publique centrale s'appliqueraient mutatis mutandis aux employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP, \u00e0 compter du 1er novembre 1968.\n[15] \u00c0 la suite de la directive donn\u00e9e par M. Finkelman, la CRTFP a effectivement adopt\u00e9, pour chacune de ses cat\u00e9gories professionnelles, les m\u00eames \u00e9chelles salariales que celles qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es pour ces m\u00eames cat\u00e9gories au sein de la fonction publique centrale, par le truchement du processus de n\u00e9gociation collective. Yvon Tarte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sident de la CRTFP, puis de la Commission des relations de travail dans la fonction publique entre 1996 et 2006, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner par la CCDP. Son t\u00e9moignage a port\u00e9 sur ce qu'il comprenait des raisons pour lesquelles M. Finkelman avait \u00e9mis la directive en cause. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la CRTFP agit \u00e0 titre d'arbitre, en toute neutralit\u00e9, dans les plaintes d\u00e9coulant d'ententes collectives, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inappropri\u00e9 que les conditions d'emploi des employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP servent de norme ou soient conformes \u00e0 celles des employ\u00e9s soumis \u00e0 sa juridiction. Ainsi, ni les syndicats ni les employeurs comparaissant devant la CRTFP ne seraient en mesure d'appuyer leurs positions respectives en se r\u00e9clamant de similitudes ou de diff\u00e9rences avec les \u00e9chelles salariales et autres conditions d'emploi des employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP.\n[16] La d\u00e9cision de la CRTFP d'adopter les \u00e9chelles salariales du CT a \u00e9t\u00e9 d'autant plus facile que la CRTFP avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 appliqu\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plupart de ses employ\u00e9s, un grand nombre des normes de classification des postes que le CT avait \u00e9tablies pour la fonction publique centrale, pratique qu'elle a appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'endroit de la plupart de ses employ\u00e9s d\u00e8s sa fondation en 1967 et qui s'est poursuivie jusqu'\u00e0 sa dissolution en 2005. Toutefois, la preuve montre que la CRTFP a eu recours \u00e0 cinq groupes de classification qui n'avaient pas cours dans la fonction publique centrale. M. Tarte a affirm\u00e9 que pendant son mandat, la CRTFP avait envisag\u00e9 de mettre en place son propre syst\u00e8me exhaustif de normes de classification, engageant un consultant afin de conduire certaines \u00e9tudes pr\u00e9liminaires sur le sujet. La CRTFP n'a finalement pas poursuivi dans cette voie, en partie du fait de la r\u00e9sistance de certains gestionnaires relativement aux ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour mener \u00e0 bien les changements, ainsi qu'en raison d'inqui\u00e9tudes relatives au fait que le changement pourrait faire obstacle aux employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP souhaitant obtenir un autre emploi au sein du gouvernement. Toutefois, M. Tarte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait effectivement plus facile pour les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP d'obtenir un poste au sein de la fonction publique centrale en ayant la m\u00eame classification que celle dudit poste, mais il a soulign\u00e9 qu'il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible \u00e0 ces employ\u00e9s de changer de poste si le syst\u00e8me de classification avait \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent. Des m\u00e9thodes avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises au point en vue d'\u00e9tablir des parall\u00e8les entre des classifications comparables dans le cadre des processus de dotation.\n[17] M. Tarte a ajout\u00e9 que compte tenu des circonstances, le degr\u00e9 de mobilit\u00e9 de la main-d'uvre de la CRTFP \u00e9tait [traduction] acceptable . Les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP pouvaient participer aux concours internes de la fonction publique (qui s'entend aussi bien de la fonction publique centrale que des employeurs distincts). Une entente particuli\u00e8re avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue avec les organismes de taille plus r\u00e9duite, aux termes de laquelle l'acc\u00e8s au bassin de candidats admissibles \u00e0 certains concours serait limit\u00e9 \u00e0 leur propre personnel. M. Tarte a expliqu\u00e9 que certains de ces organismes \u00e9taient des employeurs distincts, tandis que d'autres relevaient de la fonction publique centrale.\n[18] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tarte de comparer les t\u00e2ches accomplies par les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie CR \u00e0 celui des employ\u00e9s CR de la fonction publique centrale. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que s'il se fiait \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience du secteur public, les t\u00e2ches accomplies par les employ\u00e9s CR de la CRTFP \u00e9taient essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles des employ\u00e9s CR de la fonction publique centrale. Toutefois, il a reconnu que ses affirmations \u00e9taient uniquement fond\u00e9es sur ses propres observations. Il n'a effectu\u00e9 aucune \u00e9valuation comparative formelle des t\u00e2ches accomplies par les employ\u00e9s CR, ne d\u00e9tient aucun dipl\u00f4me en gestion des ressources humaines et n'a pas de connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en \u00e9valuation des emplois.\n[19] Un des plaignants, Richard Harkin, a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 comme biblioth\u00e9caire par la CRTFP de 1985 \u00e0 2002. Il a affirm\u00e9 avoir eu l'occasion de r\u00e9diger les descriptions de t\u00e2ches de plusieurs employ\u00e9s CR de la CRTFP qu'il avait supervis\u00e9s. \u00c0 titre de preuve de la similarit\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches accomplies par ces employ\u00e9s CR avec celles accomplies par les employ\u00e9s CR de la fonction publique centrale, il a fait valoir que pour r\u00e9diger les descriptions de t\u00e2ches susmentionn\u00e9es, il s'\u00e9tait appuy\u00e9 sur les normes de classification du CT et avait consult\u00e9 les descriptions de t\u00e2ches d'employ\u00e9s CR travaillant dans des biblioth\u00e8ques relevant de minist\u00e8res ou d'organismes de la fonction publique centrale.\nC. Les plaintes de 1984 relatives \u00e0 la disparit\u00e9 salariale au sein de la fonction publique centrale [20] En 1984, l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (l'AFPC) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la CCDP, all\u00e9guant que le CT, en sa qualit\u00e9 d'employeur de la fonction publique centrale, avait fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle CR relevant de la fonction publique centrale, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, en violation des articles 7 et 11 de la LCDP. L'AFPC soutenait que les employ\u00e9s CR \u00e9taient moins pay\u00e9s que ceux de la cat\u00e9gorie PM (administration des programmes), \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, lesquels ex\u00e9cutaient, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Le paragraphe 11(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes.\n[21] La CCDP a maintenu la plainte de 1984 en suspens en attendant les conclusions de l'Initiative conjointe syndicale-patronale relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale entre les employ\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes (l'Initiative), entreprise par le SCT en collaboration avec huit agents n\u00e9gociateurs, dont l'AFPC, en mars 1985.\n[22] Le personnel des employeurs distincts, y compris celui de la CRTFP, n'\u00e9taient pas parties \u00e0 cette plainte, qui ne comprenait aucune all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les employeurs distincts, au nombre desquels figurait la CRTFP, avaient fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de leurs employ\u00e9s CR, en violation de l'article 11 de la LCDP.\n[23] L'Initiative \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e par un comit\u00e9 mixte (le Comit\u00e9) qui a accept\u00e9 de conduire une \u00e9tude visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l'ampleur de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe au regard de l'article 11 de la LCDP et \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des m\u00e9thodes correctives pour le syst\u00e8me dans son ensemble afin d'\u00e9liminer la disparit\u00e9 salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[24] En se fondant sur les donn\u00e9es de mars 1985, le Comit\u00e9 a finalement distingu\u00e9 neuf cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et 53 cat\u00e9gories \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'Ordonnance de 1986 sur la parit\u00e9 salariale (DORS\/86-1082) (l'Ordonnance), au regard de l'article 11 de la LCDP, pour le personnel de la fonction publique dont le CT est l'employeur. Le Comit\u00e9 a convenu que ces cat\u00e9gories professionnelles comprendraient les param\u00e8tres de l'\u00e9tude. L'Ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue par le TCDP en vertu du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 27(2) de la LCDP de pr\u00e9ciser, par ordonnance, les limites et les modalit\u00e9s de l'application de la LCDP dans une cat\u00e9gorie de cas donn\u00e9s.\n[25] Le Comit\u00e9 a convenu d'avoir recours \u00e0 un plan d'\u00e9valuation des emplois pour \u00e9valuer les postes relevant des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et f\u00e9minine, au moyen d'un \u00e9chantillon de postes repr\u00e9sentatif. L'\u00e9chantillon \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9 de 3 185 postes. Le processus d'\u00e9valuation des postes, y compris la collecte de donn\u00e9es relatives \u00e0 l'emploi, a \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris \u00e0 l'automne 1987 et s'est conclu \u00e0 l'automne 1989. Des questionnaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s occupant les postes compris dans l'\u00e9chantillon. Les questions visaient \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les qualifications, les efforts, la responsabilit\u00e9 et les conditions de travail des postes inclus dans l'\u00e9chantillon. Les r\u00e9ponses des employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9es et sign\u00e9es par leurs superviseurs, afin d'en confirmer l'exactitude.\n[26] Les comit\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation mis en place par le Comit\u00e9 ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation des postes compris dans l'\u00e9chantillon. L'\u00e9tude du Comit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrompue en 1990. \u00c0 ce stade, plusieurs phases de l'\u00e9tude avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9es, mais aucune conclusion finale n'avait encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue quant au degr\u00e9 de disparit\u00e9 salariale et aucune recommandation n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e.\n[27] Quoi qu'il en soit, le 26 janvier 1990, le pr\u00e9sident du CT, l'honorable Robert De Cotret, a pris la parole \u00e0 la Chambre des communes et a annonc\u00e9 que bien que la phase finale de l'\u00e9tude n'ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9e, le gouvernement avait tranch\u00e9 que toutes les conclusions qui pourraient encore \u00eatre rendues ne seraient pas suffisamment significatives pour l'emp\u00eacher de prendre des mesures visant \u00e0 imm\u00e9diatement mettre en uvre des mesures correctrices. Il a ainsi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que des rajustements unilat\u00e9raux aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale seraient accord\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s des cat\u00e9gories CR et ST relevant du CT.\n[28] Ces rajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale ou paiements compensateurs accord\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles CR et ST incluaient :\nUn paiement r\u00e9troactif forfaitaire, pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er avril 1985 au 31 mars 1990, proportionnel \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la r\u00e9troaction pendant laquelle l'employ\u00e9 concern\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie CR ou ST;\nDes rajustements de salaire annuels et progressifs \u00e0 compter du 1er avril 1990, pour les employ\u00e9s des cat\u00e9gories CR et ST.\nD. Les r\u00e9percussions des rajustements de 1990 sur la CRTFP et les autres employeurs distincts [29] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 1990, des repr\u00e9sentants des employeurs distincts, au nombre desquels la CRTFP, ont rencontr\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants du SCT et les ont inform\u00e9s que du fait de la relation \u00e9troite entre les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la fonction publique centrale et ceux des employeurs distincts, le personnel des employeurs distincts et leurs agents n\u00e9gociateurs exer\u00e7aient des pressions en vue d'obtenir des rajustements compensateurs similaires \u00e0 ceux accord\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale. Le CT a d'abord r\u00e9pondu qu'il ne financerait aucun rajustement de salaire dans la mesure o\u00f9 les organismes demandeurs \u00e9taient des employeurs distincts.\n[30] D'apr\u00e8s le rapport interne de la CRTFP donnant suite a cette rencontre, deux options s'offraient alors : demander \u00e0 la direction des programmes du CT d'augmenter son budget en vue d'accorder aux employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP des rajustements de salaire similaires \u00e0 ceux de la fonction publique centrale ou enjoindre la CRTFP \u00e0 conduire sa propre \u00e9tude interne sur la parit\u00e9 salariale. D'apr\u00e8s le rapport, si l'\u00e9tude interne avait pour effet de rajuster les salaires \u00e0 des niveaux inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux des employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale, la CRTFP risquerait de [traduction] m\u00e9contenter ses employ\u00e9s.\n[31] Le 23 mars 1990, malgr\u00e9 le refus du SCT de financer les rajustements de salaire des employeurs distincts, le pr\u00e9sident de la CRTFP de l'\u00e9poque, Ian Deans, a envoy\u00e9 une note de service aux employ\u00e9s, les informant de sa d\u00e9cision d'approuver des rajustements aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale pour les employ\u00e9s CR et ST \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 ceux consentis par le CT aux employ\u00e9s de ces groupes relevant de la fonction publique centrale. Toutefois, M. Deans a soulign\u00e9 que ces paiements seraient conditionnels \u00e0 [traduction] l'octroi des fonds n\u00e9cessaires par le CT, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation qu'il avait adress\u00e9e au CT en ce sens.\n[32] Apparemment en r\u00e9ponse aux demandes de la CRTFP et des autres employeurs distincts, le CT a finalement modifi\u00e9 sa position relativement aux rajustements de salaire. Le 15 juin 1990, le CT a inform\u00e9 M. Deans et les autres employeurs distincts qu'il les autoriserait \u00e0 effectuer des paiements annuels progressifs compensateurs aux employ\u00e9s CR et ST, \u00e9quivalents \u00e0 ceux que le CT versait aux employ\u00e9s CR et ST de la fonction publique centrale. Toutefois, cette autorisation \u00e9tait soumise \u00e0 la condition que chaque employeur distinct conduise une \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale au sein de son organisme. Les paiements progressifs devaient prendre fin le jour o\u00f9 l'employeur distinct aurait termin\u00e9 son \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale, ou le 31 mars 1992 si l'\u00e9tude n'\u00e9tait pas termin\u00e9e avant cette date. En accordant pareille autorisation aux employeurs distincts, le CT a clairement affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'\u00e9tait souci\u00e9 de maintenir un [traduction] certain parall\u00e9lisme des salaires entre les employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale et ceux des employeurs distincts. Le CT a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son objectif n'\u00e9tait pas d'autoriser des rajustements de [traduction] parit\u00e9 salariale pour les employ\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes .\n[33] La d\u00e9cision du CT s'appliquait \u00e0 la CRTFP selon les m\u00eames modalit\u00e9s que celles qui s'appliquaient aux autres employeurs distincts. Dans une lettre qu'il a envoy\u00e9e au SCT le 20 juin 1990, M. Deans a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord relativement \u00e0 cette approche uniforme. Il a fait valoir que la CRTFP avait un statut distinct de celui des autres employeurs distincts. Il a soulign\u00e9 que la CRTFP \u00e9tait le seul employeur distinct dont le personnel \u00e9tait exclu des n\u00e9gociations collectives, et que de ce fait, depuis la fondation de l'organisme en 1967, les normes de classification de la fonction publique centrale s'appliquaient de mani\u00e8re constante aux postes cr\u00e9\u00e9s par la CRTFP.\n[34] Dans sa lettre, M. Deans a ajout\u00e9 que les \u00e9chelles salariales et autres avantages \u00e9tablis par le processus de n\u00e9gociation collective de la fonction publique centrale s'appliquaient de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re aux employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP. Il a soutenu qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel pour la CRTFP d'appliquer \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s les m\u00eames conditions et avantages que ceux ayant cours dans la fonction publique centrale afin d'\u00e9viter qu'une partie comparaissant devant la CRTFP \u00e0 l'occasion de la r\u00e9solution d'un diff\u00e9rend ne prenne celle-ci comme exemple. M. Deans a conclu que pour ces raisons, la CRTFP avait [traduction] toujours suivi de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s la classification et le r\u00e9gime de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la fonction publique centrale et que, [traduction] par cons\u00e9quent, c'est dans ce contexte que ses relations en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale devaient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es . M. Deans a ainsi inform\u00e9 le CT de son intention de rajuster les salaires des employ\u00e9s CR et ST de la CRTFP, afin qu'ils soient conformes aux salaires accord\u00e9s par le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s CR et ST. Il est probable que cela concernait aussi les paiements r\u00e9troactifs.\n[35] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 1990, M. Deans a \u00e9crit de nouveau au SCT, affirmant que les rajustements aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale, y compris les paiements r\u00e9troactifs, qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s CR et ST de la fonction publique centrale avaient [traduction] mis fin au parall\u00e9lisme historique entre les conditions d'emploi du personnel de la CRTFP et celles de la fonction publique centrale. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le fait de ne pas recevoir des rajustements similaires pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e avait eu un [traduction] effet d\u00e9sastreux sur le moral des employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP, et que cela affecterait la capacit\u00e9 de la CRTFP \u00e0 recruter et \u00e0 retenir du personnel qualifi\u00e9. M. Deans affirmait qu'il \u00e9tait [traduction] extr\u00eamement artificiel pour le CT de soutenir que si on devait conclure \u00e0 des in\u00e9galit\u00e9s entre les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et f\u00e9minine relevant de la CRTFP, les employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s n'auraient droit qu'\u00e0 des rajustements de salaire apr\u00e8s 1992. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'on [traduction] ne pouvait pas s\u00e9rieusement pr\u00e9tendre que des \u00e9chelles salariales fond\u00e9es sur des [traduction] taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration discriminatoires dans la fonction publique centrale n'\u00e9taient pas elles-m\u00eames [traduction] entach\u00e9es de discrimination .\n[36] Toutefois, il convient ici de noter que dans une note de service ant\u00e9rieurement envoy\u00e9e au personnel de la CRTFP (le 20 juillet 1990), M. Deans avait fait savoir que la direction de la CRTFP avait conduit une \u00e9tude comparative interne informelle sur les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et f\u00e9minine, laquelle \u00e9tude n'avait pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 l'existence de [traduction] probl\u00e8mes internes de parit\u00e9 salariale .\n[37] Dans sa lettre du 20 ao\u00fbt, M. Deans a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 le SCT qu'en d\u00e9pit de la position de celui-ci, il avait l'intention de [traduction] restaurer le parall\u00e9lisme au profit des employ\u00e9s CR et ST de la CRTFP (probablement pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e), en envoyant directement au CT une pr\u00e9sentation pour lui demander d'approuver le financement.\n[38] Le 29 ao\u00fbt 1990, la CRTFP a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une note de breffage au ministre (le pr\u00e9sident du CT), invoquant les m\u00eames arguments que ceux que M. Deans avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulev\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du SCT et demandant que la pr\u00e9sentation de la CRTFP soit approuv\u00e9e afin d'obtenir le financement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'octroi de paiements visant \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir le parall\u00e9lisme.\n[39] Ces efforts semblent avoir eu un certain effet sur le SCT et, le 15 septembre 1990, celui-ci a pr\u00e9venu M. Deans qu'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son personnel de r\u00e9examiner la demande de financement de la CRTFP. Le 1er novembre 1990, le CT a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Deans et \u00e0 d'autres dirigeants d'employeurs distincts, reconnaissant qu'ils \u00e9taient nombreux \u00e0 avoir envoy\u00e9 des pr\u00e9sentations au CT pour lui demander d'approuver le financement n\u00e9cessaire aux rajustements r\u00e9troactifs (forfaitaires). Le CT les informait alors de sa d\u00e9cision de rendre ces paiements possibles \u00e0 la condition que chaque employeur [traduction] mette en place, au sein de son propre organisme, des mesures visant \u00e0 \u00e9liminer la disparit\u00e9 salariale, s'il y a lieu, en application de l'article 11 de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 6 novembre 1990, M. Deans a approuv\u00e9 la mise en place de taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration r\u00e9vis\u00e9s, y compris les paiements r\u00e9troactifs et les rajustements de salaire progressifs.\n[40] La preuve montre que bien que la CRTFP n'ait jamais men\u00e9 d'\u00e9tude interne relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale, elle n'avait jamais cess\u00e9 de payer les rajustements de salaire progressifs, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s la date limite du 31 mars 1992, date que le CT avait fix\u00e9e dans sa lettre du 15 juin 1990 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Deans et aux autres employeurs distincts.\nE. La plainte relative aux droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'AFPC en 1990 [41] En f\u00e9vrier 1990, l'AFPC a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP une seconde plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11 \u00e0 l'encontre du CT, pr\u00e9tendant que les r\u00e9sultats obtenus dans le cadre de l'Initiative d\u00e9montraient que les employ\u00e9s de six cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine touchaient de plus bas salaires que les employ\u00e9s des 53 cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine \u00e9tudi\u00e9es, lesquels ex\u00e9cutaient des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes.\n[42] Les six cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine nomm\u00e9es dans la plainte \u00e9taient les CR, ST, DA-CON, LS, Soutien de l'enseignement (EU) et Services hospitaliers (HS). L'AFPC a \u00e9galement fait valoir que les rajustements compensateurs destin\u00e9s aux CR et aux ST, que le pr\u00e9sident du CT avait annonc\u00e9s en janvier 1990, ne suffisaient pas \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la violation de l'article 11. L'AFPC a demand\u00e9 r\u00e9paration pour les employ\u00e9s touch\u00e9s, pour toutes les pertes directes et indirectes subies depuis le 8 mars 1984.\n[43] Le 6 octobre 1990, la CCDP a demand\u00e9 au TCDP de se prononcer sur une partie de la plainte de l'AFPC de 1984 (l'all\u00e9gation de violation de l'article 11 de la LCDP) ainsi que sur l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 de la plainte de 1990. Le TCDP a finalement conclu, dans sa d\u00e9cision du 29 juillet 1998, que le CT avait commis un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'article 11 de la LCDP et il lui a ordonn\u00e9 d'effectuer des paiements aux employ\u00e9s des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles CR, ST, DA-CON, LS, HS et EU relevant de la fonction publique centrale, conform\u00e9ment aux conditions d\u00e9finies dans l'ordonnance. Ces paiements \u00e9taient les suivants :\nDes paiements annuels forfaitaires compensatoires pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 8 mars 1985 au 29 juillet 1998, \u00e0 calculer en se servant des donn\u00e9es d'\u00e9valuation des emplois de 1987-1988 tir\u00e9es de l'\u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'Initiative ainsi que des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en vigueur pendant l'exercice en cause (des paiements r\u00e9troactifs);\nDes rajustements de salaire aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale pour des p\u00e9riodes ult\u00e9rieures au 29 juillet 1998, qui devaient \u00eatre assimil\u00e9s aux salaires et en devenir partie int\u00e9grante (des paiements progressifs).\n[44] Le CT a demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de l'ordonnance du TCDP, mais le 19 octobre 1999, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 sa demande, avec d\u00e9pens. Le 29 octobre 1999, les repr\u00e9sentants du SCT et de l'AFPC ont conclu une entente afin de mettre en uvre la d\u00e9cision du TCDP du 29 juillet 1998. Les conditions de cette entente ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9es dans une ordonnance sur consentement rendue par le TCDP le 16 novembre 1999.\nF. Dans quelle mesure les employeurs distincts \u00e9taient-ils concern\u00e9s et touch\u00e9s par les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l'AFPC en 1984 et en 1990? [45] Dans les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant la CCDP en 1984 et en 1990, l'AFPC n'a nomm\u00e9 aucun employeur distinct, y compris la CRTFP, \u00e0 titre d'intim\u00e9s. Dans le d\u00e9tail des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l'AFPC aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP en 1984 et en 1990, il n'y a aucune all\u00e9gation selon laquelle des employeurs distincts, dont la CRTFP, auraient commis des actes discriminatoires \u00e0 l'endroit de leurs employ\u00e9s CR, ST, DA-CON et LS au sens de l'article 11 ou de toute autre disposition de la LCDP.\n[46] En l'esp\u00e8ce, toutes les parties conviennent du fait que l'\u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'Initiative ne visait pas le personnel des employeurs distincts, pas plus qu'elle ne s'appliquait \u00e0 eux. Aucun repr\u00e9sentant d'employeur distinct ne faisait partie du Comit\u00e9. Les employeurs distincts n'ont eu aucune voix au chapitre dans le choix d'un syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois choisi par le Comit\u00e9 en vue de l'\u00e9valuation des emplois ou dans le choix des modalit\u00e9s de modification du syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois. L'\u00e9chantillon constitu\u00e9 aux fins de l'\u00e9tude r\u00e9alis\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'Initiative ne comprenait aucun poste relevant d'un employeur distinct et aucun de ces postes n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9 par les comit\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuations sur le plan des qualifications, des efforts, de la responsabilit\u00e9 et des conditions de travail (soit les quatre crit\u00e8res d\u00e9finis au paragraphe 11(2) de la LCDP). Sur les 15 comit\u00e9s d'\u00e9valuation, il n'y avait aucun dirigeant d'employeurs distincts.\n[47] La d\u00e9cision que le TCDP a rendue le 29 juillet 1998 et l'ordonnance sur consentement du 29 octobre 1999 ne s'appliquaient qu'aux employ\u00e9s des minist\u00e8res, agences, tribunaux administratifs et commissions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie I de l'annexe I de la LRTFP, autrement dit la partie de la fonction publique relevant du CT. La d\u00e9cision et l'ordonnance sur consentement susmentionn\u00e9es ne visaient pas le personnel des employeurs distincts.\n[48] Le 28 juillet 1998, juste avant que le TCDP rende sa d\u00e9cision, le secr\u00e9taire du CT a \u00e9crit \u00e0 tous les employeurs distincts afin de les informer que ladite d\u00e9cision ne s'appliquerait qu'au personnel de la fonction publique relevant du CT et qu'elle ne s'\u00e9tendrait donc pas [traduction] automatiquement aux employeurs distincts.\n[49] Le 16 novembre 1999, le secr\u00e9taire du CT a \u00e9crit de nouveau \u00e0 tous les employeurs distincts, r\u00e9p\u00e9tant que la plainte d'origine d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'AFPC, la d\u00e9cision rendue par le TCDP le 29 juillet 1998 et l'ordonnance sur consentement ne s'appliquaient qu'au personnel de la fonction publique relevant du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor, et non au personnel des employeurs distincts.\n[50] Des repr\u00e9sentants du SCT ont r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 cette position lors d'une r\u00e9union d'employeurs distincts tenue par le SCT le 21 janvier 2000. M\u00eame s'ils ont fait savoir qu'aucun paiement r\u00e9troactif ne serait vers\u00e9 aux employeurs distincts, les repr\u00e9sentants du SCT ont propos\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudier les demandes de rajustements de salaire au cas par cas, en fonction des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration modifi\u00e9s des employ\u00e9s du CT, et d'\u00e9tudier les demandes de rajustement \u00e0 des fins de parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9tudes aff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9alis\u00e9es par des employeurs distincts au sein de leurs propres \u00e9tablissements . Le SCT a continu\u00e9 de fournir du soutien et des conseils techniques aux employeurs distincts proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude de leur situation en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale.\n[51] Le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2000, M. Tarte, qui avait remplac\u00e9 M. Deans comme pr\u00e9sident de la CRTFP en 1996, a \u00e9crit au secr\u00e9taire adjoint du SCT. M. Tarte a fait valoir que la situation de la CRTFP \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rente de celle des autres employeurs distincts et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le SCT devrait reconsid\u00e9rer sa position selon laquelle l'ordonnance sur consentement ne s'appliquait pas \u00e0 la CRTFP. M. Tarte a soulev\u00e9 des arguments similaires \u00e0 ceux que M. Deans avait avanc\u00e9s en 1990, quand il a essay\u00e9 de renverser la position du SCT ayant trait au financement de la CRTFP pour maintenir le parall\u00e9lisme entre les paiements. M. Tarte a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que la CRTFP se d\u00e9marquait des autres employeurs distincts, soulignant que ses employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient exclus des n\u00e9gociations collectives et insistant sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle de ne pas adopter des salaires et des avantages diff\u00e9rents de ceux du personnel de la fonction publique centrale. M. Tarte a soutenu que, compte tenu des circonstances, le personnel de la CRTFP faisait partie du groupe vis\u00e9 par l'ordonnance sur la parit\u00e9 salariale. Il a fait valoir qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la CRTFP versait \u00e0 son personnel un salaire identique \u00e0 celui que le TCDP et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ont jug\u00e9 [traduction] discriminatoire , il \u00e9tait alors impossible de pr\u00e9tendre que les salaires vers\u00e9s par la CRTFP n'\u00e9taient pas \u00e9galement discriminatoires.\n[52] Dans sa lettre, M. Tarte a aussi affirm\u00e9 que compte tenu du parall\u00e9lisme [traduction] traditionnel qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu avec la fonction publique centrale au niveau des conditions d'emploi, y compris des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, il n'y avait aucune raison que la CRTFP entreprenne une \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale de son c\u00f4t\u00e9. Lors de l'audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, M. Tarte a affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre d'avis que le fait de conduire une \u00e9tude distincte sur la parit\u00e9 salariale serait un [traduction] exercice futile et une [traduction] perte d'argent , parce qu'une telle \u00e9tude n'aurait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'organisme se rendait coupable de discrimination salariale. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'on l'avait inform\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du fait que certaines cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine dont il \u00e9tait question dans les plaintes de l'AFPC relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e9taient, \u00e0 la CRTFP, soit neutres, soit \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. M. Tarte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 ses yeux, la question centrale du diff\u00e9rend qui l'opposait au SCT \u00e9tait une question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Il \u00e9tait tout simplement in\u00e9quitable, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des conditions particuli\u00e8res r\u00e9gissant la CRTFP, que ses employ\u00e9s ne soient pas trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que le personnel de la fonction publique centrale relevant des m\u00eames cat\u00e9gories professionnelles.\n[53] Le 10 juillet 2000, le SCT a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de M. Tarte du 25 f\u00e9vrier, l'informant qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'aucun motif valide ne justifiait que le personnel de la CRTFP soit concern\u00e9 par l'ordonnance sur consentement. Le SCT a soutenu que la CRTFP n'\u00e9tait pas diff\u00e9rente des autres employeurs distincts et que par cons\u00e9quent, elle \u00e9tait un \u00e9tablissement distinct, au sens de l'article 11 de la LCDP et de l'article 10 de l'Ordonnance. Le SCT a renouvel\u00e9 ses assurances, affirmant qu'il financerait la CRTFP si celle-ci choisissait de mener sa propre \u00e9tude sur la parit\u00e9 salariale. Si une telle \u00e9tude permettait de conclure que ses taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9taient discriminatoires, le SCT serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 envisager et \u00e0 analyser toute requ\u00eate de financement additionnel, au cas o\u00f9 la CRTFP serait incapable de corriger l'acte discriminatoire avec ses propres ressources.\n[54] M. Tarte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en plus de ces \u00e9changes \u00e9crits avec le SCT, il avait eu de nombreuses conversations avec des repr\u00e9sentants du SCT \u00e0 ce sujet, mais qu'ils \u00e9taient demeur\u00e9s in\u00e9branlables.\n[55] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de la lettre du SCT du 10 juillet, M. Tarte a envoy\u00e9 une note de service au personnel de la CRTFP le 28 juillet 2000, dans laquelle il a inform\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s qu'en d\u00e9pit des [traduction] efforts renouvel\u00e9s de la CRTFP, il avait le regret de les informer que le SCT avait refuser de leur accorder [traduction] le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice des dispositions de l'entente relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue entre le CT et l'AFPC .\n[56] Il semblerait toutefois que le CT soit par la suite revenu sur sa d\u00e9cision en partie, en autorisant les fonds et en les fournissant \u00e0 la CRTFP \u00e0 la seule fin du rajustement des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en vigueur pour les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles CR, ST et LS, en fonction des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration modifi\u00e9s des employ\u00e9s du CT en vigueur apr\u00e8s le 29 juillet 1998. On ne m'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve montrant comment ou pourquoi ce changement avait eu lieu.\n[57] En cons\u00e9quence de ce rajustement, au fil des ann\u00e9es, la seule diff\u00e9rence entre la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du personnel de la CRTFP et celle du personnel du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor relevant de la fonction publique centrale, pour ces cat\u00e9gories professionnelles, a trait aux paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs compensatoires effectu\u00e9s du 8 mars 1985 au 29 juillet 1998. La pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vue de corriger cette diff\u00e9rence ainsi que celle ayant trait aux paiements r\u00e9troactifs vers\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s PE, dont il est question ci-dessous.\nG. Les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale concernant la cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle PE [58] De 1991 \u00e0 1994, plusieurs plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant la CCDP \u00e0 l'encontre du CT, affirmant que ce dernier versait des salaires plus faibles aux employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle PE, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, qu'aux employ\u00e9s des cinq cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, ce qui constitue un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'article 11 de la LCDP. Les plaintes ne concernaient que les employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie PE relevant de la partie de la fonction publique dont il est question \u00e0 la partie I de l'annexe I de la LRTFP (la fonction publique centrale). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie PE \u00e9taient exclus des n\u00e9gociations collectives, l'Assembl\u00e9e nationale des PE (l'ANPE) a \u00e9t\u00e9 constitu\u00e9e afin de repr\u00e9senter les employ\u00e9s PE dans le cadre des plaintes.\n[59] La cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle PE n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 couverte par l'\u00e9tude men\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'Initiative. Le SCT et l'ANPE ont plut\u00f4t entrepris de mener une \u00e9tude conjointe visant \u00e0 examiner les all\u00e9gations de disparit\u00e9 salariale soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant la CCDP.\n[60] Le 26 novembre 1999, sur la foi des conclusions de l'\u00e9tude, les parties ont r\u00e9gl\u00e9 les plaintes en appliquant le protocole d'entente conclu entre l'APNE et le SCT. L'entente pr\u00e9voyait une augmentation des taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e0 compter du 1er octobre 1999 ainsi que le paiement d'une somme forfaitaire r\u00e9troactive aux employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s, pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er octobre 1991 au 30 septembre 1999.\n[61] L'entente s'appliquait aux employ\u00e9s PE, anciens et actuels, des minist\u00e8res et organismes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la partie I de l'annexe I de la LRTFP (la fonction publique centrale) pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause, \u00e0 partir du 1er octobre 1991.\n[62] Ces plaintes relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale ne consistaient pas \u00e0 pr\u00e9tendre que le personnel des employeurs distincts occupant des postes relevant de la cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle PE \u00e9taient victimes de discrimination. Les employeurs distincts n'ont pas pris part \u00e0 l'\u00e9tude relative aux PE que le SCT et l'APNE ont conduite, et ils n'ont pas non plus eu voix au chapitre dans le choix d'un syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation des emplois ou de ses modalit\u00e9s d'application. L'\u00e9tude n'a pas port\u00e9 sur des postes relevant d'employeurs distincts. Les employ\u00e9s PE des employeurs distincts n'ont pas pris part \u00e0 l'entente et n'ont pas re\u00e7u de compensation en application de l'entente du fait qu'ils \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s par des organismes distincts. Toutefois, la CRTFP a formul\u00e9 une requ\u00eate, qui lui a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, afin de faire ajuster le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de ses employ\u00e9s PE pour qu'il corresponde au taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration modifi\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale \u00e0 compter du 1er octobre 1999. Par ailleurs, le CT n'a pas autoris\u00e9 le financement n\u00e9cessaire au versement d'autres paiements r\u00e9troactifs aux employ\u00e9s PE de la CRTFP entre le 1er octobre 1991 et le 30 septembre 1999.\nH. Les attentes de M. Harkin relativement aux paiements compensateurs. [63] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, un des 66 plaignants, Richard Harkin, a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 comme biblioth\u00e9caire par la CRTFP de 1985 \u00e0 2002. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul plaignant \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience. Son poste relevait de la cat\u00e9gorie LS. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en 1979, l'AFPC avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne devant la CCDP \u00e0 l'encontre du CT, pr\u00e9tendant que les employ\u00e9s LS de la fonction publique centrale, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, recevaient des salaires plus faibles que ceux des employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie servant de point de comparaison, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, lesquels ex\u00e9cutaient des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. En 1980, une entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue, aux termes de laquelle une somme additionnelle (appel\u00e9e [traduction] paiement compensateur ) devait \u00eatre vers\u00e9e chaque ann\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s LS. Les termes de cette entente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 incorpor\u00e9s dans l'entente collective qu'ont conclue l'AFPC et le CT.\n[64] Quand la CRTFP a embauch\u00e9 M. Harkin en d\u00e9cembre 1985, son offre d'emploi pr\u00e9cisait que son salaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux [traduction] dispositions r\u00e9gissant les conditions d'emploi dans la fonction publique , ce qui, aux yeux de M. Harkin, d\u00e9signait les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les autres conditions n\u00e9goci\u00e9es par l'AFPC avec le CT relativement aux employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale. En outre, cette offre d'emploi pr\u00e9cisait que les [traduction] rajustements compensateurs des employ\u00e9s LS faisaient partie de son [traduction] taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration . M. Harkin a affirm\u00e9 avoir continu\u00e9 de recevoir les paiements compensateurs pendant tout le temps o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 comme LS par la CRTFP, en d\u00e9pit du fait que ce paiement soit fond\u00e9 sur une entente conclue entre l'AFPC et le CT, entente \u00e0 laquelle la CRTFP n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie.\n[65] D'apr\u00e8s M. Harkin, cette pratique confirme que les salaires des employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP ont toujours [traduction] suivi de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s ceux de la fonction publique centrale. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que vu que la CRTFP n'avait jamais cess\u00e9 de lui verser les paiements compensateurs destin\u00e9s aux LS pendant qu'il y travaillait, il avait raisonnablement pens\u00e9 que la m\u00eame pratique serait adopt\u00e9e si d'autres paiements compensateurs \u00e9taient ordonn\u00e9s ou consentis \u00e0 l'endroit des biblioth\u00e9caires de la fonction publique centrale. Ainsi, quand il a appris que son employeur ne lui verserait pas les paiements pr\u00e9vus par l'ordonnance sur consentement de 1999, il lui a sembl\u00e9 que son contrat d'embauche, sign\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 1985, avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] mis en pi\u00e8ces .\nI. La pr\u00e9sente plainte [66] Le 27 novembre 2001, M. Harkin et 65 autres employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP, anciens ou actuels, ont r\u00e9agi \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision consistant \u00e0 ne pas leur accorder de paiements r\u00e9troactifs en d\u00e9posant la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e0 l'encontre du CT et de la CRTFP, affirmant qu'il y avait eu violation des articles 10 et 11 de la LCDP. Apr\u00e8s que la CCDP eut renvoy\u00e9 la plainte devant le TCDP, les plaignants ont abandonn\u00e9 la partie de leur plainte relative \u00e0 la violation de l'article 11 et, le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2009, le TCDP leur a permis de modifier leur plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 leur permettre de se r\u00e9clamer de l'article 7 pour all\u00e9guer qu'un autre acte discriminatoire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 commis.\n[67] Il ne s'agissait pas de la premi\u00e8re plainte d'employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP relative \u00e0 de la discrimination salariale. En avril 1991, 32 employ\u00e9s ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11 \u00e0 l'encontre du CT et de la CRTFP, affirmant que les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles CR et ST relevant de la CRTFP, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, faisaient l'objet de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les salaires de ces employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient plus bas que ceux des employ\u00e9s des cat\u00e9gories \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Les plaignants ont fait valoir que le CT et la CRTFP \u00e9taient le m\u00eame employeur et que le personnel de la CRTFP travaillait dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement que celui de la fonction publique centrale. Le 19 d\u00e9cembre 1994, la CCDP a rejet\u00e9 cette plainte au motif que, \u00e0 des fins de parit\u00e9 salariale, la CRTFP et le CT ne font pas partie du m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement et que les conditions pr\u00e9vues par le paragraphe 11(1) de la LCDP n'avaient donc pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remplies.\nJ. Comment les autres employeurs distincts ont-ils g\u00e9r\u00e9 la question de la parit\u00e9 salariale? [68] Au fil des ann\u00e9es, certains employeurs distincts ont \u00e9tudi\u00e9 leurs syst\u00e8mes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration en vue de s'assurer de leur conformit\u00e9 avec les principes de parit\u00e9 salariale. Par exemple, le Bureau du Surintendant des institutions financi\u00e8res (le BSIF) et le Conseil de recherches m\u00e9dicales ont conduit leurs propres \u00e9tudes relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale. Le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le Conseil de recherches en sciences humaines du Canada, les Instituts de recherche en sant\u00e9 du Canada et le BSIF ont mis en place des syst\u00e8mes de classification neutres afin de s'attaquer \u00e0 la question de la parit\u00e9 salariale. La CRTFP, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, n'a jamais conduit sa propre \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale.\nII. Analyse [69] Dans le cadre du r\u00e8glement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne, le plaignant doit d'abord pr\u00e9senter une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (l'arr\u00eat O'Malley)). Dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, une preuve prima facie est une preuve qui appuie les all\u00e9gations, et, si on ajoute foi \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations, qui doit \u00eatre exhaustive et suffisante pour justifier qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9ponse de la part de l'intim\u00e9. Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de la preuve incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qui doit fournir une explication raisonnable et non discriminatoire \u00e0 la conduite contest\u00e9e.\n[70] Pour que la plainte soit fond\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination constitue le seul motif des actes en cause. Il suffit qu'elle soit l'un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la conduite de l'intim\u00e9 (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1991) 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (1re inst.)).\nA. Une preuve prima facie de discrimination a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie? [71] La CCDP et M. Harkin, s'exprimant au nom des autres plaignants, ont affirm\u00e9 qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, il s'agissait essentiellement d'une question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9. Selon eux, il est in\u00e9quitable que les d\u00e9tenteurs de postes tels que ceux de commis, d'assistants administratifs et de biblioth\u00e9caires, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9s au sein de la fonction publique centrale, re\u00e7oivent des rajustements r\u00e9troactifs aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale tandis que le personnel de la CRTFP relevant des m\u00eames cat\u00e9gories ne re\u00e7oit rien.\n[72] Toutefois, la question pr\u00e9cise sur laquelle le TCDP doit se prononcer n'est pas de savoir s'il est \u00e9quitable d'avoir refus\u00e9 ces paiements aux plaignants et aux autres employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP, mais bien de savoir si la d\u00e9cision de leur refuser ces paiements constituait un acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 7 ou 10 de la LCDP. Je me pencherai d'abord sur l'article 7, laissant l'examen de l'article 10 pour plus tard.\nB. L'article 7 de la LCDP [73] L'alin\u00e9a 7b), qui est la disposition pertinente de l'article 7 que la CCDP et les plaignants ont invoqu\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce, pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d'emploi. En l'esp\u00e8ce, comment les plaignants ont-ils \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s ? En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question, la CCDP a fait valoir que les 66 plaignants \u00e9taient tous employ\u00e9s dans des postes ou des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que leurs taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 diminu\u00e9s comparativement \u00e0 ceux des employ\u00e9s des cat\u00e9gories \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine. Ils ont par cons\u00e9quent \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-pay\u00e9s. Pour l'essentiel, la CCDP soutient que les personnes employ\u00e9es par la CRTFP dans des postes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine \u00e9taient moins pay\u00e9es que les personnes employ\u00e9es dans des postes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine qui ex\u00e9cutaient des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes.\n[74] Toutefois, quelle preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir que les salaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 diminu\u00e9s? Habituellement, les plaintes consistant \u00e0 all\u00e9guer ce type de discrimination sont fond\u00e9es sur l'article 11 de la LCDP, qui pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait pour l'employeur d'instaurer ou de pratiquer la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes qui ex\u00e9cutent, dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement, des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes. Il semble s'agir du type de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par les plaignants en l'esp\u00e8ce, d'o\u00f9 il ressort que les cat\u00e9gories professionnelles CR, ST, LS et PE relevant de la CRTFP devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des [traduction] emplois f\u00e9minins , et que dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces emplois sont sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s par rapport aux [traduction] emplois masculins , les individus occupant ces postes f\u00e9minins (y compris les hommes, comme M. Harkin) ont droit aux rajustements salariaux \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9paration.\n[75] \u00c0 l'origine, les plaignants ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu violation de l'article 11, mais apr\u00e8s que la CCDP eut renvoy\u00e9 la plainte devant le TCDP, ils ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 fonder leur plainte sur cet article. Il n'ont fourni \u00e0 cela ni raison ni explication. Nous savons toutefois qu'aucune \u00e9tude comparative n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 conduite au sujet des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et masculine au sein de la CRTFP en vue d'\u00e9valuer la valeur des fonctions ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par ces employ\u00e9s, conform\u00e9ment aux d\u00e9finitions et aux facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 11 et dans l'Ordonnance. Ainsi, le type d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve habituellement produit dans de telles affaires n'\u00e9tait pas disponible. Pourquoi une telle \u00e9tude n'a-t-elle pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entreprise en l'esp\u00e8ce? Cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre par la CCDP, M. Tarte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale n'aurait pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il y avait discrimination salariale \u00e0 la CRTFP, au sens de l'article 11. Mme Nan Weiner, que la CCDP a cit\u00e9e comme experte des principes de parit\u00e9 salariale, entre autres champs de sp\u00e9cialisation, s'est dite d'avis qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment de cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine au sein de la CRTFP pour pouvoir les comparer \u00e0 des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine dans le cadre d'une \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale. Par ailleurs, un sp\u00e9cialiste de l'\u00e9valuation des postes en termes de parit\u00e9 salariale, Bob Bass, que l'intim\u00e9 a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il y avait suffisamment de classes de postes appelant \u00e0 exercer des fonctions uniques \u00e0 la CRTFP pour mener une \u00e9tude sur la parit\u00e9 salariale.\n[76] Peu importe la raison pour laquelle un tel exercice d'\u00e9valuation des postes n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris, compte tenu de l'absence de ce genre d'\u00e9tude, il n'y avait aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve disponible pour appuyer ou fonder une plainte de discrimination salariale fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11, et ce, m\u00eame si une telle plainte avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n[77] Toutefois, la CCDP fait valoir qu'aucune disposition de la LCDP ne l'emp\u00eache de prouver que ce type de discrimination salariale a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par des moyens autres que ceux pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 11. La CCDP propose une m\u00e9thode simple de prime abord, laquelle vise \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les salaires des plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] diminu\u00e9s et sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s. Elle demande au TCDP d'examiner ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 dans la fonction publique centrale. Apr\u00e8s tout, comme l'affirme la CCDP, les plaignants occupaient des postes relevant de la m\u00eame classification et recevaient les m\u00eames salaires que ceux du groupe de la fonction publique centrale qui avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l'article 11. Par cons\u00e9quent, si les salaires des employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] diminu\u00e9s , ceux de la CRTFP doivent l'avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9galement.\n[78] Je suis d'avis que cet argument ne tient pas. Il n'est pas ressorti de l'ordonnance sur consentement et de l'entente concernant les PE que les salaires des cat\u00e9gories professionnelles en cause \u00e9taient intrins\u00e8quement discriminatoires parce que ces cat\u00e9gories \u00e9taient \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine ou qu'il s'agissait d'accomplir ce que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7oit traditionnellement comme du [traduction] travail f\u00e9minin , mais plut\u00f4t parce qu'il s'agissait du r\u00e9sultat d'un exercice relatif \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale, en application de l'article 11 de la LCDP. On ne conclura qu'une diff\u00e9rence de salaire entre des employ\u00e9s relevant de cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et f\u00e9minine ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes dans un m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement constitue un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP que si une \u00e9valuation du travail accompli, men\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux d\u00e9finitions et aux facteurs d\u00e9finis dans la LCDP et dans l'Ordonnance, en conclut ainsi. La diff\u00e9rence de salaire n'est pas intrins\u00e8quement discriminatoire dans le cadre l\u00e9gislatif f\u00e9d\u00e9ral; on ne consid\u00e8re que c'est le cas que lorsque l'exercice pr\u00e9vu par l'article 11 et par l'Ordonnance a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9 \u00e0 bien.\n[79] En l'esp\u00e8ce, il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que les salaires de la fonction publique centrale \u00e9taient discriminatoires qu'au terme d'une \u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale conduite conform\u00e9ment aux principes de l'article 11, un de ces principes \u00e9tant que la discrimination pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e doit avoir cours dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement. Comme l'intim\u00e9 le souligne, le l\u00e9gislateur a voulu limiter l'obligation pour l'employeur de s'assurer que ses employ\u00e9s et employ\u00e9es ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes au sein de son \u00e9tablissement touchent un salaire \u00e9gal. Aux termes de l'Ordonnance, un \u00e9tablissement est constitu\u00e9 de tous les employ\u00e9s au service de l'employeur qui sont vis\u00e9s par la m\u00eame politique en mati\u00e8re de personnel et de salaires. C'est sur ce fondement qu'en avril 1991, la CCDP a conclu, en rejetant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par 32 employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP, que celle-ci constituait un \u00e9tablissement distinct de la fonction publique centrale. Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980, la CCDP avait rendu une d\u00e9cision similaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'un autre employeur distinct, le Centre national de recherches, d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada (Institut professionnel de la fonction publique c. Canada, A-844-81 (CAF), la requ\u00eate d'autorisation d'en appeler devant la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e [1983] C.S.C.R. n\u00b0 452).\n[80] Lorsqu'elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, Mme Weiner a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que, selon elle, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment de postes masculins susceptibles de servir de points de comparaison au sein de la CRTFP pour conduire une \u00e9tude conforme \u00e0 la m\u00e9thode vis\u00e9e par l'article 11 et par l'Ordonnance, il serait l\u00e9gitime d'user d'une autre m\u00e9thode, consistant notamment \u00e0 se fonder sur les comparaisons entre cat\u00e9gories professionnelles \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es en application de l'article 11, dans le contexte de l'\u00e9tude effectu\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'Initiative, et finalement, de l'ordonnance sur consentement. Un tel exercice pourrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 en comparant les emplois f\u00e9minins \u00e0 la CRTFP aux emplois masculins de la fonction publique centrale ou alors, en effectuant une comparaison au moyen d'un point de comparaison [traduction] de substitution ou [traduction] t\u00e9moin . La derni\u00e8re approche convient aux organismes o\u00f9 il y a une majorit\u00e9 de femmes et trop peu de points de comparaison masculins. Ces emplois f\u00e9minins seraient compar\u00e9s \u00e0 des emplois \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine dans un organisme t\u00e9moin comptant suffisamment de points de comparaison masculins et o\u00f9 il y a d\u00e9j\u00e0 parit\u00e9 salariale. Si on conclut que les emplois f\u00e9minins des deux organismes sont de valeur \u00e9gale, alors les salaires de l'organisme demandeur devraient \u00eatre rajust\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence. Apparemment, les r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifs du Qu\u00e9bec et de l'Ontario relatifs \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale permettent express\u00e9ment d'avoir recours \u00e0 cette approche dans certaines circonstances.\n[81] Toutefois, les suggestions de Mme Weiner ne s'accordent pas avec le r\u00e9gime en place au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. L'article 11 et l'Ordonnance pr\u00e9voient une analyse interne uniquement fond\u00e9e sur les \u00e9valuations du travail du personnel employ\u00e9 dans le m\u00eame \u00e9tablissement. Des comparaisons externes au moyen d'\u00e9tablissements de substitution ou t\u00e9moins ne sont pas envisag\u00e9es.\n[82] Toutefois, la proposition de Mme Weiner pose la question de savoir si une plainte relative \u00e0 une question de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes peut \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en se fondant sur l'article 7 ou sur l'article 10 plut\u00f4t que sur l'article 11, en faisant appel \u00e0 une analyse ou \u00e0 une m\u00e9thodologie que l'article 11 ne pr\u00e9voit pas, comme celles qu'elle a propos\u00e9es.\n[83] Je suis d'avis que c'est impossible. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 dans les observations finales de l'intim\u00e9, en \u00e9dictant l'article 11, le l\u00e9gislateur a souhait\u00e9 cerner quelle \u00e9tait la situation en mati\u00e8re de discrimination salariale d\u00e9coulant de la sous-estimation et de la r\u00e9tribution insuffisante du travail des femmes comparativement \u00e0 celui des hommes et am\u00e9liorer cette situation. Dans la d\u00e9cision que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 rendue relativement aux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par l'AFPC en 1990 (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada, [2000] 1 C.F. 146 (1re inst.)), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a soulign\u00e9 que l'article 11 visait principalement \u00e0 rem\u00e9dier au probl\u00e8me de l'\u00e9cart salarial d\u00e9favorable aux femmes, lequel r\u00e9sulte d'une s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation relative au march\u00e9 du travail et fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et de la sous-\u00e9valuation institutionnelle des t\u00e2ches habituellement ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es par les femmes (voir aussi Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490, au paragraphe 90).\n[84] Le l\u00e9gislateur s'est express\u00e9ment pench\u00e9 sur cette question dans l'article 11, \u00e9non\u00e7ant les moyens par lesquels cette forme de discrimination devait \u00eatre \u00e9tablie. Si une partie a l'impression qu'elle est incapable de prouver, en se pr\u00e9valant des moyens pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article 11, que le travail des femmes a \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-estim\u00e9 et qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sous-employ\u00e9es peut-elle sous couvert de la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la LCDP relative \u00e0 la discrimination dans le cadre de l'emploi (l'alin\u00e9a 7b)) \u00e9tablir l'existence de la disparit\u00e9 salariale au moyen d'une autre m\u00e9thode que celle pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 11, en usant par exemple d'un point de comparaison t\u00e9moin ou de substitution? Je ne le pense pas, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cette approche irait \u00e0 contre-courant des intentions explicites du l\u00e9gislateur, qui voulait que les plaintes relatives \u00e0 des questions de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes soient r\u00e9solues au moyen de l'analyse pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 11.\n[85] Je souscris \u00e0 l'observation de l'intim\u00e9, selon lequel ce raisonnement s'appuie sur la r\u00e8gle d'interpr\u00e9tation des lois generalia specialibus non derogant, plus connue sous le nom de r\u00e8gle de l'exception implicite. Cette r\u00e8gle stipule que lorsqu'une disposition l\u00e9gale portant express\u00e9ment sur le probl\u00e8me en cause entre en conflit avec une autre disposition dont le champ d'application est plus large, on r\u00e9sout la question en appliquant la disposition qui s'applique express\u00e9ment \u00e0 la question en cause, au d\u00e9triment de la disposition plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. De toute \u00e9vidence, le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9fini la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 appliquer pour \u00e9tablir qu'il y a parit\u00e9 salariale au sein de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. S'\u00e9carter de cette m\u00e9thode et en importer d'autres, m\u00eame adopt\u00e9es par d'autres provinces, serait selon moi inappropri\u00e9.\n[86] La Cour du Banc de la Reine s'est prononc\u00e9e sur une question similaire dans Saskatchewan in University of Saskatchewan c. Dumbovic, 2007 SKQB 182, en ce qui concerne les lois provinciales relatives aux droits de la personne. La Cour du Banc de la Reine a soulign\u00e9 que m\u00eame si la l\u00e9gislation de la Saskatchewan exigeait que les employ\u00e9s et les employ\u00e9es touchent un salaire \u00e9gal s'ils ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, ou largement \u00e9quivalentes, aucune loi provinciale n'exige que les fonctions \u00e9quivalentes soient r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9es par un salaire \u00e9gal. Dans cette affaire, la plaignante avait par cons\u00e9quent fond\u00e9 sa plainte sur la disposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale relative \u00e0 la discrimination (paragraphe 16(1)) du Saskatchewan Human Rights Code (le Code), qui stipule qu'aucun employeur ne peut faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard d'une personne ou d'une classe de personne en cours d'emploi pour un motif illicite. Cette disposition est similaire \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP. La Cour du Banc de la Reine a conclu que le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Saskatchewan n'avait pas la comp\u00e9tence voulue pour conna\u00eetre des plaintes relatives aux questions d'in\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de l'article 16 du Code.\n[87] La Cour du Banc de la Reine a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des raisonnements complexes n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la mise en uvre, \u00e0 l'administration et \u00e0 l'application d'un r\u00e9gime d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale pour les fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, citant certaines conclusions du rapport final du groupe de travail sur la parit\u00e9 salariale, intitul\u00e9 \u00c9quit\u00e9 salariale : une nouvelle approche \u00e0 un droit fondamental (Ottawa, Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada, 2004). La Cour du Banc de la Reine a soulign\u00e9 que l'introduction de dispositions relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale dans le Code soul\u00e8verait des questions d'incompatibilit\u00e9 avec d'autres dispositions l\u00e9gales provinciales, prenant note de la recommandation du groupe de travail selon laquelle la l\u00e9gislation relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale devrait comprendre certains crit\u00e8res, structures, m\u00e9thodologies et proc\u00e9dures sp\u00e9cifiques. La Cour du Banc de la Reine a conclu que ces derniers \u00e9l\u00e9ments d'une analyse relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale ne pouvaient na\u00eetre de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la formulation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale l'article 16. Il est n\u00e9cessaire de disposer d'une l\u00e9gislation sp\u00e9cifique.\nAu paragraphe 108, la Cour du Banc de la Reine a ajout\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLes arbitres doivent comprendre la diff\u00e9rence qui existe entre l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de la loi d'une part, et l'\u00e9laboration de celle-ci d'autre part. En l'esp\u00e8ce, seule une l\u00e9gislation appropri\u00e9e peut instituer la structure l\u00e9gale et r\u00e9glementaire n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation, \u00e0 l'administration et \u00e0 la mise en uvre d'un r\u00e9gime d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 salariale pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes dans les lieux de travail de la Saskatchewan. Toute vell\u00e9it\u00e9 de les b\u00e2tir \u00e0 partir de l'interpr\u00e9tation du paragraphe 16(1) du Code irait bien au-del\u00e0 des limites acceptables de l'interpr\u00e9tation des lois. Cela aurait pour effet d'empi\u00e9ter sur le r\u00f4le et la responsabilit\u00e9 du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[88] M\u00eame si je suis conscient que cette d\u00e9cision avait trait \u00e0 une question de comp\u00e9tence d'un tribunal des droits de la personne provincial plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 un exercice d'interpr\u00e9tation d'une loi, comme c'est le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce, je pense que le raisonnement de la Cour du Banc de la Reine peut, par analogie, s'appliquer aux efforts visant \u00e0 introduire dans la LCDP, au moyen de son article 7, d'autres formes d'analyses relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale que celle pr\u00e9vue par l'article 11 ainsi que par l'Ordonnance.\n[89] La CCDP pr\u00e9tend que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur d'exiger que les plaintes relatives \u00e0 des questions de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes soient uniquement fond\u00e9es sur l'article 11 n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement aussi \u00e9vidente que l'intim\u00e9 le pr\u00e9tend. La CCDP a renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi sur l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du secteur public, L.C. 2009, ch. 2, art. 394 (la LERSP), tout r\u00e9cemment promulgu\u00e9e, en application de laquelle la CRTFP a re\u00e7u le pouvoir de conna\u00eetre des plaintes relatives aux questions de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9quitable dans le secteur public. Les dispositions transitoires de la LERSP pr\u00e9voient, au paragraphe 396(1), que les plaintes ci-apr\u00e8s dont la CCDP \u00e9tait saisie avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la LERSP seront renvoy\u00e9es devant la CRTFP par la CCDP :\nles plaintes fond\u00e9es sur les articles 7 ou 10 de [la LCDP], dans le cas o\u00f9 celles-ci portent sur la disparit\u00e9 salariale entre les hommes et les femmes instaur\u00e9e ou pratiqu\u00e9e par l'employeur; les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l'article 11 de la [LCDP].\n[90] La CCDP fait valoir qu'en regroupant de la sorte ces trois dispositions de la LCDP, le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 son intention de voir les questions de parit\u00e9 salariale examin\u00e9es \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re d'au moins une de ces dispositions de la LCDP. Je ne suis pas d'accord. Le premier paragraphe ne fait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des diff\u00e9rences de salaire entre des employ\u00e9s et des employ\u00e9es ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes.\n[91] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9 au paragraphe 86 de Dumbovic, la discrimination salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe peut \u00e9galement rev\u00eatir d'autres formes. Par exemple, le fait de verser des salaires diff\u00e9rents \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s et \u00e0 des employ\u00e9es ex\u00e9cutant des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes reviendrait \u00e0 d\u00e9favoriser les employ\u00e9es, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP. Le fait de verser des salaires diff\u00e9rents aux hommes et aux femmes pour ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes ou largement \u00e9quivalentes peut \u00e9galement constituer un acte discriminatoire au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b). Une telle situation survient quand les employ\u00e9s ex\u00e9cutent des fonctions largement \u00e9quivalentes tout en ayant des titres diff\u00e9rents. Par exemple, dans la d\u00e9cision Walden, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, on a conclu que des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux (ou m\u00e9decins), relevant d'une cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, et des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux (ou infirmiers), relevant d'une cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, uvrant ensemble \u00e0 l'administration du Programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada ex\u00e9cutaient des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, ou largement \u00e9quivalentes. Toutefois, seuls les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient class\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9, ce qui leur permettait de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des avantages additionnels et de la reconnaissance attach\u00e9e \u00e0 ce titre.\n[92] Ces types de discrimination salariale fond\u00e9e sur le sexe doivent \u00eatre distingu\u00e9s des plaintes relatives \u00e0 des questions de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, qui sont fond\u00e9es par une \u00e9valuation de la valeur relative des emplois en fonction de facteurs sp\u00e9cifiques. Au niveau du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, le cadre de ces \u00e9valuations est d\u00e9fini par l'article 11 de la LCDP et par l'Ordonnance.\n[93] En outre, l'intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que la formulation des dispositions transitoires de la LERSP peut traduire l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur de voir toutes les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l'article 11 (y compris les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur l'article 7 ou 10) entendues en totalit\u00e9 par la CRTFP plut\u00f4t que de voir le TCDP mener un processus parall\u00e8le visant \u00e0 \u00e9tudier les parties de la plainte relatives aux articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, en ce qui a trait au m\u00eame ensemble de faits.\n[94] Quoi qu'il en soit, je ne suis pas convaincu que la LERSP et ses dispositions transitoires aient des r\u00e9percussions sur ma conclusion selon laquelle l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait, et demeure, de s'assurer que les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne qui ont trait aux questions de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes soient uniquement fond\u00e9es sur l'article 11 de la LCDP.\n[95] Dans ses arguments, la CCDP a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au principe selon lequel les lois relatives aux droits de la personne doivent recevoir une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale afin de s'assurer que leurs objectifs soient atteints. Toutefois, ce principe ne s'applique que lorsque la loi est d'ambigu\u00eb (Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2003 CSC 36, au paragraphe 26). Je suis d'avis qu'il n'y aucune ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9fini la m\u00e9thode visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si on \u00e9tait en pr\u00e9sence d'une question de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, intention traduite par l'article 11 et la publication subs\u00e9quente par la CCDP de l'Ordonnance, en application de la LCDP.\n[96] La CCDP a formul\u00e9 un argument subsidiaire visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir que les plaignants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b). L'ordonnance sur consentement et l'entente sur les PE ont permis de conclure que les employ\u00e9s de certaines cat\u00e9gories de la fonction publique centrale \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine \u00e9taient sous-pay\u00e9s. Ils gagnaient donc des [traduction] salaires f\u00e9minins . Sachant que ses employ\u00e9s occupant des postes relevant des m\u00eames cat\u00e9gories recevaient ces m\u00eames [traduction] salaires f\u00e9minins , la CRTFP et, ce qui est plus important, le CT, auraient d\u00fb [traduction] se pencher sur la [traduction] forte probabilit\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP soient victimes de la m\u00eame discrimination. D'apr\u00e8s la CCDP, le fait que le CT n'ait pas rem\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 cette situation en approuvant le financement des paiements compensateurs r\u00e9troactifs a eu pour effet de d\u00e9favoriser ces employ\u00e9s, ce qui constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[97] Je ne vois pas comment le fait que la CRTFP et le CT n'aient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9, ou ne se soient pas [traduction] pench\u00e9s , sur la possibilit\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par la CCDP ait eu pour effet de d\u00e9favoriser les employ\u00e9s en question. Les plaignants ne recevaient pas des [traduction] salaires f\u00e9minins intrins\u00e8quement discriminatoires. Aux termes de la LCDP, la question de savoir si des salaires in\u00e9gaux sont vers\u00e9s pour ex\u00e9cuter des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes est vis\u00e9e par l'article 11 et par l'Ordonnance. Mme Weiner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral aux fins de la parit\u00e9 salariale, et selon sa m\u00e9thode de pr\u00e9dilection, un salaire devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme f\u00e9minin si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des normes \u00e9tablies par la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, l'emploi associ\u00e9 \u00e0 ce salaire est vu comme f\u00e9minin . Il se peut qu'il s'agisse d'une m\u00e9thode l\u00e9gitime et appropri\u00e9e pour conduire une analyse \u00e0 des fins de parit\u00e9 salariale, mais elle n'est pas coh\u00e9rente avec l'approche d\u00e9finie dans la LCDP et dans l'Ordonnance.\n[98] Le fait est que la CRTFP \u00e9tait un employeur distinct au sens de la LRTFP et de la LGFP, et un \u00e9tablissement distinct au sens de l'article 11 de la LCDP, comme la CCDP l'a elle-m\u00eame \u00e9tabli en 1991. L'ordonnance sur consentement et l'entente sur les PE ne s'appliquaient pas \u00e0 la CRTFP. Je n'en conclus pas que le fait que l'employeur distinct ait pr\u00e9tendument omis de consid\u00e9rer la [traduction] probabilit\u00e9 que ses taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration soient \u00e9galement discriminatoires a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 les employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s, ce qui constituerait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Il y avait certainement une distinction, fond\u00e9e sur l'employeur des plaignants (la CRTFP plut\u00f4t qu'un minist\u00e8re ou un organisme de la fonction publique centrale). Le personnel de la CRTFP a fini par toucher un salaire qui n'int\u00e9grait pas le rajustement r\u00e9troactif que les employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale avaient re\u00e7u. Cela peut sembler in\u00e9quitable, mais cela ne prouve pas que les plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s et victimes de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[99] En outre, le CT s'est pench\u00e9 sur l'existence possible d'un probl\u00e8me relatif \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale en recommandant que les employeurs distincts, dont la CRTFP, conduisent leurs propres \u00e9tudes relatives \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale, en s'engageant \u00e0 les y aider et, finalement, en \u00e9tant dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 envisager d'accorder le financement n\u00e9cessaire au versement des rajustements de salaire jug\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires au terme de ces \u00e9tudes.\n[100] Dans ses observations finales, la CCDP a soulign\u00e9 qu'il y avait dans la preuve de nombreux indicateurs donnant \u00e0 penser que le CT devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme le v\u00e9ritable employeur du personnel de la CRTFP, y compris des plaignants. Apr\u00e8s tout, les emplois de la plupart des employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP (mais pas de tous) \u00e9taient class\u00e9s selon les normes de classification du CT et M. Tarte a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il lui semblait que les employ\u00e9s CR de la CRTFP accomplissaient des t\u00e2ches similaires \u00e0 celles des employ\u00e9s CR de la fonction publique centrale. D'apr\u00e8s les bulletins du personnel de la CRTFP d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve, les d\u00e9cisions relatives \u00e0 la classification des postes au sein de l'organisation devaient \u00eatre rendues en fonction des normes de classification en vigueur dans la fonction publique centrale. Les salaires des plaignants \u00e9voluaient parall\u00e8lement \u00e0 ceux des employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale, y compris les paiements relatifs de 1990 et les paiements compensateurs de 1980 destin\u00e9s aux employ\u00e9s LS. Les mesures de dotation prises \u00e0 la CRTFP \u00e9taient r\u00e9gies par la Loi sur l'emploi dans la fonction publique, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-33, tout comme celles concernant la fonction publique centrale. Les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP pouvaient s'en aller travailler \u00e0 la fonction publique centrale et en revenir assez facilement. Le CT exer\u00e7ait le contr\u00f4le sur l'octroi des fonds \u00e0 la CRTFP et aux autres employeurs distincts, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor ayant en fait le contr\u00f4le sur le salaire du personnel des employeurs distincts. Historiquement, n'eut \u00e9t\u00e9 de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de conserver sa neutralit\u00e9, comme M. Finkelman l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le premier, la CRTFP serait rest\u00e9e partie de la fonction publique centrale et ne serait jamais devenue un employeur distinct. Pour r\u00e9sumer, la CCDP affirme que le CT exer\u00e7ait de facto le contr\u00f4le sur la gestion du personnel de la CRTFP. Par cons\u00e9quent, la CCDP pr\u00e9tend que, comme M. Tarte l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre au SCT du 25 f\u00e9vrier 2000, m\u00eame si la CRTFP est un employeur distinct et n'est partie \u00e0 aucune plainte relative aux droits de la personne, ses employ\u00e9s faisaient partie du groupe vis\u00e9 par l'ordonnance sur consentement.\n[101] Toutefois, peu importe que le CT soit l'employeur de facto, je ne vois pas comment cela modifie ou influence mes conclusions ant\u00e9rieures relatives \u00e0 l'application de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) en l'esp\u00e8ce. Que l'employeur soit la CRTFP, le CT, ou comme la CCDP l'a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9, Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine en dernier ressort, il n'en demeure pas moins qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 la CRTFP, sous la forme de salaires in\u00e9gaux pour des fonctions \u00e9quivalentes, au moyen de la m\u00e9thodologie d\u00e9finie par le l\u00e9gislateur, comme le pr\u00e9voit l'article 11 de la LCDP.\n[102] Je n'ai fait aucune distinction entre les r\u00f4les de la CRTFP et du CT dans ma pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente r\u00e9flexion concernant la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) et mes conclusions sont essentiellement interchangeables entre les deux employeurs possibles en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si, en l'esp\u00e8ce, une preuve prima facie de discrimination avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b).\n[103] En outre, m\u00eame si le CT est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l'employeur aussi bien de la CRTFP que de la fonction publique centrale, la CRTFP n'en constitue pas moins un \u00e9tablissement distinct de la fonction publique centrale au sens de l'article 11, ce que la CCDP avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu en 1991. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, il n'est pas possible de conclure automatiquement, \u00e0 partir de l'\u00e9tude relative \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 salariale et des conclusions d'une entit\u00e9 ou d'un \u00e9tablissement distincts, soit la fonction publique centrale, que les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la CRTFP sont discriminatoires.\n[104] Il se peut que la suggestion voulant que les employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP soient de facto employ\u00e9s par le CT milite en faveur de l'argument selon lequel ils ont directement droit aux paiements compensateurs r\u00e9troactifs pr\u00e9vus par l'ordonnance sur consentement et par l'entente concernant les PE, \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9s du CT. Toutefois, il s'agirait d'une question d'application d'une ordonnance du TCDP, ou de non-application de l'entente concernant les PE. Le moyen de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces questions est d'assimiler l'ordonnance du TCDP ou l'entente concernant les PE \u00e0 une ordonnance de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comme le pr\u00e9voient le paragraphe 48(3) et l'article 57 de la LCDP.\n[105] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus que m\u00eame si on donnait foi aux all\u00e9gations et aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les plaignants et la CCDP, aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination n'a \u00e9tabli que les plaignants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b).\nC. L'article 10 de la LCDP [106] L'alin\u00e9a 10a) de la LCDP, partie de l'article 10 pertinente aux fins des all\u00e9gations des plaignants, pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur ou l'association patronale de fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite. La CCDP a formul\u00e9 des observations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de l'alin\u00e9a 10a) en se fondant sur l'hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle les plaignants touchaient des [traduction] salaires discriminatoires , ajoutant que lesdits salaires \u00e9taient pay\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 des lignes de conduite \u00e9tablies par la CRTFP ou le CT. Pour les m\u00eames raisons que celles que j'ai donn\u00e9es relativement \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'alin\u00e9a 7b), j'ai conclu qu'il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que les salaires vers\u00e9s par la CRTFP d\u00e9favorisaient son personnel, ce qui constituerait un acte discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, sur cette seule base, une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de l'alin\u00e9a 10a) ne peut \u00eatre fond\u00e9e, m\u00eame en pr\u00e9sentant une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[107] De plus, je ne suis pas convaincu que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour appuyer l'hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle les plaignants se sont vu refuser une occasion d'emploi, m\u00eame s'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s sur le plan de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, ce qui constituait de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. La CCDP a fait valoir que si les plaignants avaient su qu'ils ne recevraient pas les m\u00eames rajustements de salaire r\u00e9troactifs que les employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale, ce qui les privait ainsi d'un salaire \u00e9gal , ils auraient [traduction] tr\u00e8s bien pu choisir de ne pas rester au service de la CRTFP, d\u00e9cidant plut\u00f4t de chercher un emploi au sein de la fonction publique centrale afin de conserver un [traduction] salaire \u00e9gal . Compte tenu des paiements relatifs et des paiements compensateurs vers\u00e9s par le pass\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s LS, CR et ST de la CRTFP, il \u00e9tait raisonnable pour les plaignants de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que tous les futurs rajustements consentis aux employ\u00e9s de la fonction publique centrale leur soient \u00e9galement accord\u00e9s.\n[108] Un tel argument tient de la plus pure conjecture. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 montrant que la perspective de salaires parall\u00e8les \u00e0 ceux de la fonction publique avait influenc\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de la CRTFP \u00e0 ne pas chercher d'emploi dans la fonction publique centrale. En outre, m\u00eame si de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, je ne suis pas convaincu par l'argument de la CCDP que la d\u00e9cision d'un employ\u00e9 de ne pas chercher un autre emploi pour les raisons avanc\u00e9es serait susceptible d'annihiler ses chances d'emploi ou d'avancement au sens de l'article 10. Toutefois, compte tenu de l'absence susmentionn\u00e9e d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve appuyant les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l'article 10, il ne m'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9laborer davantage sur ce dernier point.\n[109] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus \u00e9galement qu'aucune preuve prima facie de discrimination, au sens de l'article 10, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\nIII. Conclusion [110] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e et je la rejette.\nSign\u00e9e par Athanasios D.

Lustig\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate au sujet d'une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par beachesboy@aol.com contre HBoss.\n[2] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 15 juillet 2005. Le plaignant soutient que l'intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'orientation sexuelle envers lui et envers d'autres personnes en communiquant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, sur les babillards \u00e9lectroniques d'AOL Canada, des messages qui \u00e9taient susceptibles d'exposer les homosexuels \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris, selon le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Les actes contest\u00e9s ont eu lieu approximativement du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2005 au 6 juin 2005.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 30 ao\u00fbt 2007. Le 29 novembre 2007, la Commission a fourni au Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 4(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, les coordonn\u00e9es des parties.\n[4] Le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re lettre \u00e0 toutes les parties, le 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, leur demandant leur position au sujet de la m\u00e9diation. Le plaignant et la Commission ont r\u00e9pondu qu'ils \u00e9taient en faveur de la m\u00e9diation.\n[5] La lettre initiale du Tribunal, dat\u00e9e du 19 d\u00e9cembre 2007, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par messager \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal le 14 janvier 2008 avec la mention [traduction] NON R\u00c9CLAM\u00c9E . La m\u00eame lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 le 23 janvier 2008 par courrier ordinaire, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au Tribunal le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2008 avec la mention [traduction] D\u00c9M\u00c9NAG\u00c9 .\n[6] Le 11 f\u00e9vrier 2008, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de lui fournir une autre adresse pour l'intim\u00e9. La Commission n'a pas fourni d'autre adresse.\n[7] Le 5 juin 2009, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de lui fournir des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires au sujet de l'adresse de l'intim\u00e9. En date du 20 novembre 2009, le Tribunal n'avait toujours pas re\u00e7u ces pr\u00e9cisions.\n[8] Le 20 novembre 2009, le Tribunal a charg\u00e9 la Commission de signifier au plaignant et de d\u00e9poser au Tribunal, au plus tard le 27 novembre 2009, les pr\u00e9cisions au sujet des coordonn\u00e9es de l'intim\u00e9 et de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la question de savoir si l'affaire devait \u00eatre instruite. Les instructions du Tribunal pr\u00e9cisaient que le plaignant avait jusqu'au 4 d\u00e9cembre 2009 pour signifier \u00e0 la Commission et d\u00e9poser au Tribunal des observations \u00e9crites sur la m\u00eame question.\n[9] Le 25 novembre 2009, la Commission a \u00e9crit au Tribunal pour l'aviser qu'il \u00e9tait impossible de trouver l'intim\u00e9 et que toutes les tentatives de le retracer avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] infructueuses . La Commission a aussi not\u00e9 qu'aucun autre document r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention depuis 2005. Dans sa lettre, la Commission pr\u00e9cisait qu'elle \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il n'\u00e9tait plus dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public d'instruire la plainte et recommandait, compte tenu des circonstances, le rejet de la plainte.\n[10] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2009, le Tribunal a fait parvenir au plaignant la lettre qu'il lui avait envoy\u00e9e le 20 novembre 2009, lui demandant une r\u00e9ponse au plus tard le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2009. Aucune r\u00e9ponse n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue.\n[11] Il semble que les parties ne soient plus int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 participer \u00e0 cette affaire.

Lustig\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision au sujet de la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9 le 4 septembre 2009 visant \u00e0 faire ajourner ind\u00e9finiment l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[2] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 29 janvier 2007. Il soutient que l'intim\u00e9 a communiqu\u00e9 par Internet des messages susceptibles d'exposer les membres de la communaut\u00e9 juive \u00e0 la haine ou au m\u00e9pris en raison de leur appartenance \u00e0 un groupe identifiable, selon le paragraphe 13(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Le plaignant fait valoir que le comportement contest\u00e9 a eu lieu de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e.\n[3] Le 16 septembre 2008, la Commission, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le TCDP) d'instruire la plainte.\n[4] Le 2 septembre 2009, le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Warman c. Lemire 2009 TCDP 26. Cette affaire portait sur une plainte de propagande haineuse vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 13(1) de la LCDP. Dans sa d\u00e9cision exhaustive, le membre instructeur Hadjis a conclu :\n[...] j'ai \u00e9galement conclu que le paragraphe 13(1) et les paragraphes 54(1) et 54(1.1) sont incompatibles avec l'alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte qui garantit la libert\u00e9 de pens\u00e9e, de croyance, d'opinion et d'expression. La limite impos\u00e9e par ces dispositions n'est pas une limite raisonnable au sens de l'article premier de la Charte.\n[5] Le 1er octobre 2009, la Commission a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Lemire du Tribunal (voir dossier no T-1640-09 de la CF).\n[6] Dans son communiqu\u00e9 de presse, en date du 1er octobre 2009, portant sur le contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la Commission a fait les pr\u00e9cisions suivantes :\nLa Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire afin de clarifier des points de droit importants soulev\u00e9s par la d\u00e9cision. Ces points de droit s\u00e9tendent au-del\u00e0 de la pr\u00e9sente esp\u00e8ce et pourraient avoir une incidence sur dautres tribunaux administratifs. Par cons\u00e9quent, lincertitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision ne sert pas lint\u00e9r\u00eat public et justifie quune instance sup\u00e9rieure rende une d\u00e9cision ex\u00e9cutoire.\nLa demande repose sur deux motifs. La Commission est d'avis que :\n(1) Le Tribunal a commis une erreur de droit en statuant que la fa\u00e7on dont la requ\u00e9rante exerce le mandat dont elle est investie par la loi pourrait rendre larticle 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne inconstitutionnel;\n(2) Les conclusions du Tribunal \u00e0 propos de linconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de larticle 13 d\u00e9coulent aussi de ladoption de lalin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et du paragraphe 54(1.1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, par suite du jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans laffaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892. Le Tribunal a commis une erreur de droit en refusant dappliquer larticle 13 de la Loi parce quun refus dappliquer lalin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et le paragraphe 54(1.1) aurait constitu\u00e9 une r\u00e9paration suffisante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[7] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal leurs observations au sujet de la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 en ajournement. Il convient de noter que la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Lemire.\n[8] J'ai examin\u00e9 les observations des parties et j'ai conclu qu'il serait appropri\u00e9 et qu'il servirait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d'ajourner l'affaire. Bien que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ait conclu, dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, que le paragraphe 13(1) de la LCDP est constitutionnel, la demande dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est pr\u00e9sentement saisie vise \u00e0 clarifier la question en fonction du contexte factuel et l\u00e9gal distinct de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l'affaire Warman c. Lemire. Il est clair que la d\u00e9cision du membre instructeur Hadjis d\u00e9passe la simple question des dispositions sur les sanctions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 54 de la LCDP, puisqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas \u00e9carter les dispositions sur les sanctions et pr\u00e9server l'article 13 de la LCDP. Il revient maintenant \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de l'article 13 de la LCDP. Cela permettra d'obtenir les clarifications demand\u00e9es par la Commission et dont, \u00e0 mon avis, le Tribunal a besoin pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire et sur d'autres affaires portant sur l'article 13 de la LCDP.\n[9] Pour ces motifs, j'ajourne l'instance ind\u00e9finiment en attendant le r\u00e9sultat final de l'affaire Warman c.

Par cons\u00e9quent, lincertitude cr\u00e9\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision ne sert pas lint\u00e9r\u00eat public et justifie quune instance sup\u00e9rieure rende une d\u00e9cision ex\u00e9cutoire.\nLa demande repose sur deux motifs. La Commission est davis que :\n(1) Le Tribunal a commis une erreur de droit en statuant que la fa\u00e7on dont la requ\u00e9rante exerce le mandat dont elle est investie par la loi pourrait rendre larticle 13 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne inconstitutionnel;\n(2) Les conclusions du Tribunal \u00e0 propos de linconstitutionnalit\u00e9 de larticle 13 d\u00e9coulent aussi de ladoption de lalin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et du paragraphe 54(1.1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, par suite du jugement de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans laffaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892. Le Tribunal a commis une erreur de droit en refusant dappliquer larticle 13 de la Loi parce quun refus dappliquer lalin\u00e9a 54(1)c) et le paragraphe 54(1.1) aurait constitu\u00e9 une r\u00e9paration suffisante \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[7] Les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal leurs observations au sujet des requ\u00eates des intim\u00e9s. Il convient de noter que les requ\u00eates ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es avant la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Lemire.\n[8] Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder la suspension de l'instance, par contre, il peut ajourner l'affaire dont il est saisi.\n[9] J'ai examin\u00e9 les observations des parties et j'ai conclu qu'il serait appropri\u00e9 et qu'il servirait l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d'ajourner l'affaire. Bien que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ait conclu, dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Taylor, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 892, que le paragraphe 13(1) de la LCDP est constitutionnel, la demande dont la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est pr\u00e9sentement saisie vise \u00e0 clarifier la question en fonction du contexte factuel et l\u00e9gal distinct de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l'affaire Warman c. Lemire. Il est clair que la d\u00e9cision du membre instructeur Hadjis d\u00e9passe la simple question des dispositions sur les sanctions pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 54 de la LCDP, puisqu'il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas \u00e9carter les dispositions sur les sanctions et pr\u00e9server l'article 13 de la LCDP. Il revient maintenant \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de l'article 13 de la LCDP. Cela permettra d'obtenir les clarifications demand\u00e9es par la Commission et dont, \u00e0 mon avis, le Tribunal a besoin pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la pr\u00e9sente affaire et sur d'autres affaires portant sur l'article 13 de la LCDP.\n[10] Pour ces motifs, j'ajourne l'instance ind\u00e9finiment en attendant le r\u00e9sultat final de l'affaire Warman c. Lemire.\nEdward P.

Levan Turner est le plaignant en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il se d\u00e9crit comme un homme de race noire, qui avait 37 ans au moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte. Il occupe pr\u00e9sentement un poste au sein du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral comme PM-2 \u00e0 Service Canada. Il occupe ce poste depuis juin 2008.\n[2] En 2005, M. Turner a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Sa plainte, dat\u00e9e du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2005, vise l'Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, (l'ASFC). L'ASFC a vu le jour le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Il s'agit de l'agence qui a remplac\u00e9 l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (l'ADRC). L'ASFC est responsable de l'application des lois en mati\u00e8re de douanes et d'immigration aux fronti\u00e8res canadiennes. Apr\u00e8s la cr\u00e9ation de l'ASFC, le poste d'inspecteur des douanes (ID) est devenu le poste d'agent des services frontaliers (ASF).\n[3] La plainte de M. Turner d\u00e9coule de deux concours pour un poste d'inspecteur des douanes \u00e0 l'ASFC. Il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature aux deux concours. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature, il travaillait comme ID saisonnier pour l'\u00e9t\u00e9 dans le port de Victoria. Il avait travaill\u00e9 comme ID saisonnier \u00e0 Victoria de 1998 \u00e0 2003.\n[4] Le premier concours pour lequel il a pos\u00e9 sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 par l'ASFC le 9 juin 2003 pour un poste d'ID \u00e0 Vancouver (C.-B.) (Vancouver 1002). Le deuxi\u00e8me concours a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 par l'ASFC le 11 octobre 2003 pour un poste d'ID \u00e0 Victoria (C.-B.) (Victoria 7003). M. Turner n'a obtenu aucun de ces postes. Dans les deux cas, le jury de s\u00e9lection du concours a conclu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 pour devenir ID.\n[5] M. Turner soutient que les d\u00e9cisions des jurys de s\u00e9lection \u00e9taient entach\u00e9es de motifs discriminatoires, notamment sa race, son origine nationale ou ethnique ou son \u00e2ge, au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nA. L'exp\u00e9rience de M. Turner avant le poste d'inspecteur des douanes [6] Le CV de M. Turner indique qu'il a occup\u00e9 divers emplois \u00e0 Toronto entre 1985 et 1995. Il s'est aussi inscrit \u00e0 un programme de quatre ans en g\u00e9ographie \u00e0 l'Universit\u00e9 de Toronto, mais il ne l'a pas termin\u00e9.\n[7] Son CV indique aussi qu'entre 1991 et 1995, il \u00e9tait membre du service de police auxiliaire de la R\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Il s'agit d'une activit\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9vole qui comprenait la participation au service de police communautaire, le contr\u00f4le de la circulation pour des \u00e9v\u00e9nements sp\u00e9ciaux et les relations publiques avec la communaut\u00e9.\n[8] Comme b\u00e9n\u00e9vole, il accompagnait en voiture un agent de police r\u00e9gulier et il l'aidait dans ses t\u00e2ches polici\u00e8res. Il \u00e9tait form\u00e9 en tactiques d\u00e9fensives et en tactiques d'amen\u00e9es au sol et de menottage. M. Turner a estim\u00e9 que, comme policier auxiliaire, il avait accumul\u00e9 plus de 2 000 heures d'exp\u00e9rience en services policiers et en application de la loi.\nB. L'exp\u00e9rience de M. Turner comme inspecteur des douanes (i) De mai 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1998 [9] En 1995, M. Turner a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Victoria. Son premier emploi comme ID saisonnier dans l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime de Revenu Canada, Douanes et accises (le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de l'ADRC) \u00e0 Victoria a eu lieu de mai 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1998. L'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime est responsable du traitement externe des bateaux de croisi\u00e8re, des transbordeurs, des avions, des embarcations de plaisance et des hydravions. Pour les transbordeurs qui arrivent au port de Victoria, l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime traitait principalement avec le Coho et le Clipper. Le Coho est un transbordeur \u00e0 voitures qui traverse entre Victoria et Port Angeles, et le Clipper est un transbordeur \u00e0 passagers qui traverse de Seattle \u00e0 Victoria.\n[10] Les t\u00e2ches d'un ID comprennent le contr\u00f4le des biens et des personnes qui traversent la fronti\u00e8re internationale, la tenue d'une entrevue avec ces personnes et l'\u00e9valuation de leur admissibilit\u00e9 au Canada.\n[11] L'intervention maritime comprend une inspection primaire et une inspection secondaire. L'inspection primaire est le premier contact avec un ID pour les personnes qui d\u00e9barquent d'un transbordeur ou d'un bateau de croisi\u00e8re. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que ces personnes pr\u00e9sentent leur d\u00e9claration en douanes et qu'elles sont questionn\u00e9es par un ID.\n[12] \u00c0 ce moment, l'ID d\u00e9termine si les personnes sont admises au Canada ou si elles sont envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 l'inspection secondaire pour un contr\u00f4le plus en d\u00e9tail. Pour prendre cette d\u00e9cision, l'ID est form\u00e9 pour poser des questions de routine et pour chercher des indicateurs, par exemple s'il croit le voyageur, comment le voyageur r\u00e9pond aux questions et si le voyageur est vague, ensuite l'ID d\u00e9cide s'il envoie le voyageur \u00e0 l'inspection secondaire ou s'il lui permet d'entrer au Canada.\n[13] Si le voyageur est renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'inspection secondaire, l'ID de l'inspection primaire doit remplir une feuille de renvoi qui doit \u00eatre donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ID de l'inspection secondaire. Celui-ci, qui travaille dans un autre endroit, doit examiner la feuille de renvoi, v\u00e9rifier ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit lors de l'inspection primaire et prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires. Cela peut \u00eatre la collecte de droits et de taxes de douane, le renvoi de la personne \u00e0 l'immigration si n\u00e9cessaire ou l'admission de la personne au Canada. L'inspection secondaire a aussi un aspect d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res importante. Cela comprend le fait de fouiller, d'appr\u00e9hender ou d'arr\u00eater une personne qui cherche \u00e0 entrer au Canada et qui ne fait pas preuve de coop\u00e9ration, qui est belliqueuse ou qui devient intraitable lorsqu'elle est questionn\u00e9e par un ID.\n(ii) De d\u00e9cembre 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1999 [14] M. Turner est retourn\u00e9 travailler comme ID saisonnier \u00e0 Victoria de d\u00e9cembre 1998 jusqu'en octobre 1999. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait pris ce poste parce qu'il souhaitait devenir un ID \u00e0 temps plein. Il adorait l'interaction avec le public et, pendant son travail comme policier auxiliaire, il \u00e9tait devenu tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ress\u00e9 dans le domaine de l'application de la loi. Le travail d'ID lui donnait le meilleur des deux mondes.\n[15] Lorsqu'il a recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler en d\u00e9cembre 1998, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 au Centre de d\u00e9claration par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone (CDT) et il y a travaill\u00e9 de d\u00e9cembre 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1999. Le CDT est un poste statique. Un ID assign\u00e9 au CDT travaille pendant un quart complet et, r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, ne fait aucun traitement externe.\n[16] La t\u00e2che d'un ID au CDT est de d\u00e9douaner les bateaux priv\u00e9s et les a\u00e9ronefs qui arrivent \u00e0 Victoria de l'\u00e9tranger. Le capitaine du bateau priv\u00e9 ou le pilote de l'a\u00e9ronef t\u00e9l\u00e9phone au CDT pour obtenir un d\u00e9douanement par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour le Canada.\n[17] L'ID effectue la m\u00eame entrevue et pose les m\u00eames questions que s'il d\u00e9douanait une personne qui traverse la fronti\u00e8re par la voie terrestre ou par transbordeur. Si le voyageur est admis au Canada, il obtient un num\u00e9ro d'autorisation qui lui est donn\u00e9 par le CDT et qui sert de preuve qu'il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et qu'il a obtenu l'autorisation d'un ID.\n[18] Si l'ID d\u00e9termine que de plus amples renseignements ou un examen plus approfondi sont n\u00e9cessaires, le voyageur est renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 une inspection secondaire faite par un autre ID \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du CDT.\nC. L'\u00e9valuation de rendement de M. Turner de d\u00e9cembre 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1999 [19] \u00c0 la fin de la saison, M. Turner a re\u00e7u un examen de rendement \u00e9crit pour la p\u00e9riode de d\u00e9cembre 1998 \u00e0 octobre 1999 du surintendant Perry, son superviseur au CDT.\n[20] Dans l'examen de rendement, le surintendant Perry a \u00e9crit que M. Turner avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 de bonnes connaissances des lois et des r\u00e8glements li\u00e9s aux t\u00e2ches que l'inspecteur des douanes effectue et aux op\u00e9rations du CDT. Son apparence \u00e9tait toujours professionnelle et elle respectait les directives de l'Agence. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Turner travaillait bien avec le reste des membres de l'\u00e9quipe et qu'il aidait \u00e0 former les nouveaux employ\u00e9s qui arrivaient au CDT. Le surintendant Perry a not\u00e9 dans l'examen que les employ\u00e9s du CDT ne font que des renvois et qu'ils aident rarement aux inspections primaires ou secondaires. Il a recommand\u00e9 que M. Turner soit r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 comme ID pour la saison suivante.\n[21] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le CDT \u00e9tait la partie du poste d'ID o\u00f9 il se sentait le plus \u00e0 l'aise et que c'\u00e9tait au CDT qu'il passait le plus de son temps. Cependant, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que pendant cette saison, de temps en temps, il aidait au traitement externe en faisant des inspections secondaires. Il a cependant reconnu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9 dans l'examen de rendement qu'il avait effectu\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches d'inspection secondaires.\n(i) De mai 2000 \u00e0 octobre 2000 [22] M. Turner est retourn\u00e9 comme ID au CDT et y a travaill\u00e9 de mai 2000 \u00e0 octobre 2000. Le surintendant Perry a de nouveau pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son examen de rendement. Il a not\u00e9 que M. Turner avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 de prendre des d\u00e9cisions avec des renseignements limit\u00e9s et qu'il faisait preuve de bon sens et de jugement \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. Son esprit d'\u00e9quipe \u00e9tait l'un de ses points les plus forts et il aidait beaucoup \u00e0 former les nouveaux employ\u00e9s. Il cherchait toujours des moyens d'am\u00e9liorer le fonctionnement du travail et il partageait ses id\u00e9es avec le reste des employ\u00e9s. Il avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une connaissance approfondie des diff\u00e9rents syst\u00e8mes utilis\u00e9s au CDT. Une fois de plus, il n'est pas mentionn\u00e9 si M. Turner a aid\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime. Le surintendant Perry a recommand\u00e9 la r\u00e9embauche de M. Turner pour la saison suivante.\n(ii) De mai 2001 \u00e0 septembre 2001 [23] M. Turner a travaill\u00e9 comme ID \u00e0 Victoria avec l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime de mai 2001 \u00e0 septembre 2001. Son examen de rendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par la surintendante Kathryn Pringle. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que M. Turner agissait de fa\u00e7on polie et professionnelle. Il communiquait efficacement tant \u00e0 l'oral qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9crit. Il travaillait bien avec ses co\u00e9quipiers et il \u00e9tait toujours pr\u00eat \u00e0 aider aux t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires sans se plaindre. Elle a not\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait devenu l'expert interne en informatique au CDT et qu'il \u00e9tait capable de r\u00e9soudre des probl\u00e8mes lorsqu'il n'y avait aucun soutien technique, en particulier pendant les fins de semaine.\n(iii) D'octobre 2001 \u00e0 octobre 2002 [24] En octobre 2001, fonctionnant sous \u00e9tat d'alerte en raison des \u00e9v\u00e9nements du 11 septembre, l'ADRC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'embaucher ses ID saisonniers au-del\u00e0 de la saison estivale. Le contrat de M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 d'octobre 2001 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2001, puis jusqu'en octobre 2002, o\u00f9 il travaillait au traitement externe avec l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime.\n[25] Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, il a re\u00e7u deux examens de rendement, un examen vers le milieu de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et un examen \u00e0 la fin de la saison. Dans son examen de rendement d'ao\u00fbt 2002, son superviseur, le surintendant Baird, a not\u00e9 que M. Turner avait une tr\u00e8s bonne compr\u00e9hension du processus d'inspection primaire et qu'il \u00e9tait capable de faire des renvois de qualit\u00e9 lorsqu'il facilitait le passage \u00e0 la fronti\u00e8re de voyageurs pr\u00e9sentant un risque faible. Il \u00e9tait capable de prendre des d\u00e9cisions appropri\u00e9es lorsqu'il effectuait les inspections secondaires et il \u00e9tait professionnel, m\u00eame lors de circonstances difficiles.\n[26] M. Turner avait un bon esprit d'\u00e9quipe, il communiquait bien tant avec le public qu'avec ses coll\u00e8gues et il avait le potentiel de devenir un communicateur tr\u00e8s efficace. Le surintendant Baird l'a lou\u00e9 pour les efforts qu'il avait faits pour pr\u00e9senter les probl\u00e8mes de fa\u00e7on constructive, apr\u00e8s avoir mentionn\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait de quelque chose que M. Turner ne r\u00e9ussissait pas \u00e0 faire par le pass\u00e9. Il a conclu en encourageant M. Turner \u00e0 obtenir plus d'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res en effectuant des inspections secondaires.\n[27] Dans son examen de rendement de fin de saison du 14 octobre 2002, le surintendant Baird a \u00e9crit que M. Turner avait une excellente compr\u00e9hension des proc\u00e9dures d'inspections primaire et secondaire. Il avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une capacit\u00e9 efficace \u00e0 traiter des situations difficiles ou hostiles et il avait fait preuve de bon jugement lorsqu'il effectuait des inspections secondaires et des activit\u00e9s d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res.\n[28] Il a not\u00e9 que M. Turner avait r\u00e9ussi la formation de pouvoirs des agents et de recours \u00e0 la force au d\u00e9but de l'\u00e9t\u00e9, qu'il avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des inspections secondaires au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et qu'il avait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 accumuler de l'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res. Comme c'\u00e9tait le cas pour ses autres examens de rendement, M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 f\u00e9licit\u00e9 pour sa bonne interaction avec le public et ses coll\u00e8gues et pour sa volont\u00e9 d'effectuer du travail suppl\u00e9mentaire lorsqu'on lui demandait.\n[29] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le surintendant Baird a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des commentaires sur les deux examens de rendement qu'il avait pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour M. Turner en 2002. Il y avait des choses qu'il appr\u00e9ciait \u00e0 propos de M. Turner en tant qu'employ\u00e9 et de son travail bien fait. Cependant, il n'aurait pas qualifi\u00e9 M. Turner de personne qui se d\u00e9veloppait compl\u00e8tement dans tous les r\u00f4les attendus d'un ID. M. Turner \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e0 l'aise dans la partie de l'emploi qui \u00e9tait plus ax\u00e9e vers le service, comme le travail au CDT.\n[30] Quant aux parties de l'emploi qui n\u00e9cessitaient un travail plus proactif en mati\u00e8re d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res et d'identification du non-respect parmi les voyageurs, ou le fait d'effectuer des inspections secondaires et d'appliquer la loi, comme dans le cas de saisies, il ne s'agissait pas de forces pour M. Turner.\n[31] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'examen de rendement du milieu de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2002 de M. Turner, le surintendant Baird a indiqu\u00e9 qu'on expliquait aux employ\u00e9s leurs buts et objectifs au d\u00e9but de la saison, ce qu'on attendait d'eux et la fa\u00e7on dont leur rendement serait \u00e9valu\u00e9. L'examen de rendement de mi-saison visait \u00e0 leur laisser savoir s'ils \u00e9taient sur la bonne voie ou s'il y avait des probl\u00e8mes de rendement.\n[32] Le surintendant Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'opinion qu'il avait toujours eue de M. Turner \u00e9tait qu'il \u00e9tait toujours poli et courtois lorsqu'il traitait avec le public et avec des coll\u00e8gues et qu'il se pr\u00e9sentait toujours de fa\u00e7on professionnelle m\u00eame lors de circonstances difficiles.\n[33] Quant \u00e0 son commentaire au sujet de pr\u00e9senter des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s au travail de fa\u00e7on constructive, il a soutenu qu'il avait ajout\u00e9 ce point pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment pour r\u00e9gler un probl\u00e8me de rendement que M. Turner avait en milieu de travail. Il a observ\u00e9 que parfois, M. Turner avait tendance \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter les probl\u00e8mes en se plaignant, selon le surintendant Baird. Il a not\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'un probl\u00e8me pour M. Turner et il a reconnu que ce dernier avait bien r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ce point et qu'il avait fait des efforts pour \u00eatre plus constructif.\n[34] Le surintendant Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a inscrit dans l'examen de rendement que M. Turner avait le potentiel pour devenir un bon intervieweur, il soulignait que M. Turner poss\u00e9dait les capacit\u00e9s fondamentales pour d\u00e9velopper de bonnes capacit\u00e9s d'entrevue. Cependant, il ne disait pas que M. Turner \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un bon intervieweur. Il devait y travailler.\n[35] Les bonnes techniques d'entrevue sont d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es par la pratique. Plus une personne effectue d'inspections secondaires et se concentre sur cet ensemble de capacit\u00e9s, plus elle a d'occasions de se perfectionner et de d\u00e9velopper ses comp\u00e9tences. Il a observ\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'un domaine o\u00f9 M. Turner \u00e9tait faible et qu'il ne mettait pas assez d'effort pour perfectionner ces capacit\u00e9s.\n[36] Le surintendant Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au sujet de l'exp\u00e9rience d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res que le CDT offre tr\u00e8s peu d'exp\u00e9rience de ce genre parce qu'il s'agit d'un poste o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 r\u00e9pond au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et fait des renvois sur le terrain. Il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s rare qu'un employ\u00e9 du CDT aide aux inspections secondaires.\n(iv) De mai 2003 \u00e0 septembre 2003 [37] M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 pour la derni\u00e8re fois comme ID saisonnier de mai 2003 \u00e0 septembre 2003 et il a travaill\u00e9 au traitement ext\u00e9rieur dans l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime. Son examen de rendement a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par son gestionnaire, le surintendant Terry Klassen. Dans son examen de rendement, le surintendant Klassen a indiqu\u00e9 que M. Turner offrait un service de qualit\u00e9 au public et \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues. Parfois, il avait pris le r\u00f4le de leader lorsque le surintendant n'\u00e9tait pas sur place.\n[38] Il a not\u00e9 que M. Turner avait une bonne compr\u00e9hension de l'application des mesures douani\u00e8res et qu'il appliquait les programmes de fa\u00e7on juste, responsable et efficace. Il a soutenu que les documents de saisie pour cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0 montraient que M. Turner avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 six actions d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res diff\u00e9rentes. Dans trois de ces actions, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l'agent principal, une fois pour une saisie et deux fois pour des incidents de pouvoirs des agents, actions qui portaient toutes sur des narcotiques.\n[39] Cependant, le surintendant Klassen a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une exp\u00e9rience d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res moyenne pour cet \u00e9t\u00e9-l\u00e0 et que cette exp\u00e9rience ne donnerait pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 un ID une compr\u00e9hension large ou un bon fondement pour l'application des mesures douani\u00e8res. L'application des mesures douani\u00e8res ne traite pas seulement d'infractions en mati\u00e8re de narcotiques. Elle comprend aussi la saisie d'autres articles interdits tels que la pornographie, l'alcool, le tabac, les v\u00eatements, les souvenirs ou les bijoux que les voyageurs ne d\u00e9clarent pas. Beaucoup de domaines d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 couverts dans le cadre de ces six actions d'application.\n[40] Il a conclu que M. Turner avait satisfait \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 des attentes en mati\u00e8re de rendement et il a recommand\u00e9 la r\u00e9embauche de M. Turner.\n[41] Apr\u00e8s leur rencontre du 26 septembre 2003 pour discuter de l'examen de rendement et pour le signer, M. Turner et le surintendant Klassen ont eu une discussion informelle dans laquelle le surintendant Klassen a soulev\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes qu'il n'avait pas mentionn\u00e9es dans l'examen de rendement.\n[42] M. Klassen a dit \u00e0 M. Turner que certains surintendants avaient l'impression qu'il avait tendance \u00e0 ne pas effectuer les t\u00e2ches plus difficiles et qu'il \u00e9vitait du travail. M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cela l'avait surpris compte tenu de son examen de rendement. Il \u00e9tait surpris que le surintendant Klassen ne lui en avait pas parl\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t pour qu'il puisse y r\u00e9pondre.\n[43] Le surintendant Klassen a aussi dit \u00e0 M. Turner que d'autres inspecteurs des douanes s'\u00e9taient plaints du fait qu'il ne s'occupait pas de l'encaissement \u00e0 la fin de son quart de travail. L'encaissement vise \u00e0 retirer l'argent recueilli pour les droits et les taxes \u00e0 la fin du quart de travail, en laissant suffisamment de volant de liquidit\u00e9s pour le prochain quart, et \u00e0 transporter le reste de l'argent au bureau principal. Au bureau principal, l'argent doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le coffre pour que le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 de jour apporte l'argent \u00e0 la banque le lendemain matin. Une fois de plus, M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s surpris d'entendre cela parce que personne ne lui en avait parl\u00e9 auparavant.\n[44] David Cormie, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ID pendant 32 ans, travaillait avec M. Turner dans l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime. M. Cormie d\u00e9crirait M. Turner comme l'un des meilleurs ID avec lesquels il avait travaill\u00e9. Il n'aurait jamais d\u00e9crit M. Turner comme une personne paresseuse ou qui se soustrayait \u00e0 ses obligations.\n[45] M. Cormie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il travaillait pendant le quart de travail suivant celui de M. Turner, mais qu'il ne se souvenait pas de plaintes au sujet du fait que M. Turner n'effectuait pas ses encaissements. M. Cormie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait toujours d'une d\u00e9cision personnelle quant \u00e0 savoir si l'on encaissait un petit montant, par exemple 50 $, ou si on le laissait pour le prochain quart de travail.\n[46] Apr\u00e8s sa discussion informelle avec M. Turner, M. Klassen a envoy\u00e9 un courriel dat\u00e9 du 4 octobre 2003 aux autres surintendants, Rick Peninger, Mara Gibbons, Kathryn Pringle, Trevor Baird et Diane Kavelaars. Dans son courriel, M. Klassen a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] J'en suis ensuite venu au point et je lui ai parl\u00e9 de la fa\u00e7on dont il est per\u00e7u, c'est-\u00e0-dire comment il \u00e9vite parfois les t\u00e2ches plus difficiles, ou qu'il conna\u00eet la bonne proc\u00e9dure, mais qu'il demande l'avis du surintendant, esp\u00e9rant que le surintendant utilisera son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et choisira la voie la plus facile. J'ai aussi mentionn\u00e9 que d'autres inspecteurs s'\u00e9taient plaints du fait qu'il laissait les encaissements pour les prochaines personnes plut\u00f4t que de les effectuer pendant son quart de travail.\n[47] Les trois derni\u00e8res phrases du courriel se lisaient comme suit: [Traduction] Je lui ai demand\u00e9 de bien se surveiller l'ann\u00e9e prochaine pour s'assurer qu'il n'\u00e9vite pas d'effectuer les t\u00e2ches plus difficiles ou qu'il ne cherche pas \u00e0 trouver un chemin plus facile. Il m'a ensuite demand\u00e9 qu'on lui donne de la r\u00e9troaction continue sur notre perception de son travail. La conversation s'est tr\u00e8s bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sans conflit.\n[48] Le 12 octobre 2003, il a envoy\u00e9 un autre courriel aux surintendants, intitul\u00e9 [Traduction] Discussion avec Levan, deuxi\u00e8me partie . Il a \u00e9crit : [Traduction] J'ai oubli\u00e9 une partie importante de la conversation. Elle portait sur sa pr\u00e9sence au travail.\n[49] M. Turner se souvient avoir discut\u00e9 de sa pr\u00e9sence au travail pendant la discussion informelle. M. Klassen s'inqui\u00e9tait de la sant\u00e9 de M. Turner ou se demandait s'il abusait de ses cong\u00e9s de maladie. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des rapports sur les cong\u00e9s de M. Turner d\u00e9montrait une augmentation marqu\u00e9e de son utilisation des cong\u00e9s de maladie et d'obligations familiales au cours de ses ann\u00e9es d'emploi. M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce probl\u00e8me ne lui avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 auparavant.\n[50] En ce qui a trait aux cong\u00e9s d'obligations familiales, M. Turner a expliqu\u00e9 que sa conjointe recevait des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 et qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. Cependant, elle devait retourner au travail et M. Turner aurait besoin de moins de cong\u00e9s pour obligations familiales.\n[51] Le courriel du surintendant Klassen se terminait par le commentaire suivant : [Traduction] Nous avons termin\u00e9 la discussion d'une heure et demie avec mon explication qu'il doit \u00eatre conscient de l'image qu'il pr\u00e9sente, soit d'un employ\u00e9 qui saute \u00e0 pied joint dans le travail et qui ne cherche pas la solution facile. Il m'a demand\u00e9 de mentionner aux autres surintendants qu'ils devaient se sentir bien libres de venir discuter avec lui lorsque quelque chose ne fonctionnait pas, parce que ce type d'\u00e9vitement du travail ne fait pas partie de son \u00e9thique de travail ni de sa nature.\n[52] Le surintendant Klassen n'a pas inscrit ses pr\u00e9occupations dans l'examen de rendement de M. Turner parce que ce dernier n'avait pas eu l'occasion d'y r\u00e9pondre.\n[53] Le surintendant Klassen a aussi indiqu\u00e9 qu'il avait eu cette discussion avec M. Turner pour que, lorsque celui-ci reviendrait \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2004, ce que M. Klassen recommandait, son prochain superviseur puisse voir les commentaires et travailler avec M. Turner afin de r\u00e9gler ces probl\u00e8mes l'ann\u00e9e suivante.\n[54] M. Klassen a reconnu qu'il n'avait pas envoy\u00e9 de courriel semblable aux autres surintendants au sujet de sa rencontre de fin de saison avec les autres employ\u00e9s saisonniers.\n[55] M. Turner n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 pour la saison estivale de 2004. On lui a dit que l'ASFC avait chang\u00e9 ses pratiques d'embauche.\nD. Les concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents [56] Bien que M. Turner ait re\u00e7u des examens de rendement tr\u00e8s positifs lors de ses cinq ann\u00e9es de travail saisonnier, il n'a pas eu de bons r\u00e9sultats lors de concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour un poste ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 d'ID.\n[57] M. Turner a pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste d'ID dans le concours Victoria 2009. Il a pass\u00e9 une entrevue le 2 avril 2002, mais ne l'a pas r\u00e9ussie, obtenant une note insuffisante de 60 pour la partie d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res. Dans leurs notes d'entrevue, les membres du jury de s\u00e9lection, soit les surintendants Kathryn Pringle et Dave Denis, ont inscrit que M. Turner n'avait pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 la capacit\u00e9 d'exercer un jugement \u00e9quilibr\u00e9. La raison pour cette note \u00e9tait qu'en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question, il a dit qu'il ne recueillerait des droits et des taxes que si le voyageur acceptait de payer.\n[58] Le jury de s\u00e9lection a aussi not\u00e9 que l'un des exemples qu'il a donn\u00e9 pendant son entrevue portait sur un incident qui avait eu lieu quatre ans plus t\u00f4t. Cela a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 penser au jury de s\u00e9lection que M. Turner n'avait pas d'exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9cente d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res, bien qu'il avait plusieurs ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience de travail comme ID.\n[59] En mai 2002, peu apr\u00e8s son entrevue, la surintendante Pringle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner et lui a expliqu\u00e9 que c'est son manque d'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res qui avait affect\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement son rendement pendant son entrevue. Elle l'a encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au traitement externe dans l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime pendant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant plut\u00f4t qu'au CDT pour qu'il obtienne plus d'exp\u00e9rience d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res. Elle l'a aussi encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 poser sa candidature dans les concours \u00e0 venir s'il souhaitait obtenir un poste ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 lorsqu'il aurait obtenu l'exp\u00e9rience requise.\n[60] Au d\u00e9but, M. Turner a r\u00e9sist\u00e9 \u00e0 ces conseils, expliquant \u00e0 la surintendante Pringle que, comme il n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se qualifier pour le concours, il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait travailler au CDT o\u00f9 il croyait que ses talents seraient mieux utilis\u00e9s. Cependant, il a bien travaill\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime la saison suivante.\n[61] En 2002, M. Turner a de nouveau pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste d'ID dans le concours Victoria 7012. Il a pass\u00e9 une entrevue le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003 et, une fois de plus, il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se qualifier.\n[62] Dans l'entrevue, M. Turner a re\u00e7u une note sous le seuil de r\u00e9ussite pour la partie d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res et pour la partie du service. Un jury de s\u00e9lection constitu\u00e9 cette fois-ci des surintendants Tarnawski, Northcote et Pringle avaient eu des pr\u00e9occupations semblables au sujet de son approche \u00e0 l'application de mesures douani\u00e8res. Le jury de s\u00e9lection a not\u00e9 que M. Turner n'obtenait pas tous les renseignements avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision. Il a suppos\u00e9 de nombreuses choses au sujet de la personne avec qui il traitait et de la fa\u00e7on dont il devait la traiter. L'entrevue a eu lieu apr\u00e8s ses examens de rendement de mi-saison et de fin d'\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2002, dans lesquels le surintendant Baird avait soulign\u00e9 que M. Turner avait besoin de plus d'exp\u00e9rience d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res.\nE. Le concours Vancouver 1002 [63] Le concours Vancouver, 2003-1727-PAC-3391-1002, \u00e9tait dat\u00e9 du 9 juin 2003. Il s'agissait d'un concours pour un poste d'ID dans le district de l'A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, le district du Grand Vancouver et le district Pacific Highway. Le concours \u00e9tait ouvert aux personnes r\u00e9sidant ou travaillant \u00e0 l'ouest des montagnes rocheuses canadiennes.\n[64] En plus des crit\u00e8res \u00e0 respecter pour pouvoir \u00eatre inclus dans le concours, il y avait une restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 qui pr\u00e9voyait : [Traduction] Les candidats qui ont subi l'entrevue pour ce poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne sont pas admissibles au concours.\n[65] Le concours \u00e9tait ouvert tant pour les candidats qui travaillaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la fonction publique que pour les candidats externes. Les candidatures \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en ligne \u00e0 la section des ressources humaines, qui compilait une liste ma\u00eetresse des noms et adresses des candidats et de la date de candidature. Les candidatures \u00e9taient ensuite donn\u00e9es au jury de s\u00e9lection nomm\u00e9 pour le concours en particulier, qui d\u00e9cidait alors qui passait \u00e0 la prochaine \u00e9tape.\n[66] Lorsqu'un candidat \u00e9tait retenu pour la prochaine \u00e9tape, il \u00e9tait alors invit\u00e9 \u00e0 subir le test d'inspecteur des douanes (TID). Les candidats qui avaient fait le test et l'avaient r\u00e9ussi n'avaient plus \u00e0 le refaire. La note de passage \u00e9tait de 585 sur 900.\n[67] Les candidats qui r\u00e9ussissaient le TID recevaient un portefeuille des comp\u00e9tences (PdC) \u00e0 remplir et \u00e0 retourner. Pour le concours Vancouver 1002, huit comp\u00e9tences \u00e9taient inscrites : adaptabilit\u00e9, initiative, orientation du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le, traitement des situations difficiles, prise de d\u00e9cisions, confiance en soi, travail d'\u00e9quipe et coop\u00e9ration et communication interpersonnelle efficaces.\n[68] Les candidats devaient d\u00e9crire un \u00e9v\u00e9nement particulier, qui avait eu lieu id\u00e9alement deux ou trois ans plus t\u00f4t, et pr\u00e9ciser ce qu'ils avaient fait, ce qu'ils ressentaient et ce qu'ils avaient pens\u00e9, en utilisant un \u00e9v\u00e9nement diff\u00e9rent pour chaque comp\u00e9tence.\n[69] Le jury de s\u00e9lection effectuait d'abord un examen papier de l'ensemble des PdC soumis par chaque candidat et d\u00e9terminait s'il y avait suffisamment de renseignements pour d\u00e9montrer que le candidat comprenait les comp\u00e9tences. Si c'\u00e9tait le cas, le candidat \u00e9tait invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue.\n[70] \u00c0 l'entrevue, le jury de s\u00e9lection posait des questions aux candidats sur certaines des comp\u00e9tences. Il s'agissait d'un exercice plus intensif de la part du jury de s\u00e9lection et donnait aux candidats l'occasion de pr\u00e9ciser leurs r\u00e9ponses \u00e9crites.\n[71] M. Turner a lu l'affiche pour le concours Vancouver 1002 et a cru qu'il s'agissait d'un poste \u00e0 l'A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, au district du Grand Vancouver et au district Pacific Highway. Parce qu'il n'avait pas pass\u00e9 d'entrevue pour un poste d'ID \u00e0 Vancouver depuis le 1er janvier 2002, il a cru qu'il \u00e9tait admissible au concours.\n[72] Le concours Vancouver 1002 comprenait deux entrevues. M. Turner a satisfait aux \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9liminaires et a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re entrevue le 26 avril 2004. Les membres du comit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lection \u00e9taient les surintendants Ron Tarnawski, Mark Northcott et Karen Morin\n[73] Lors de la discussion informelle avant l'entrevue officielle, M. Turner a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tarnawski qu'il l'avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9 auparavant. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la r\u00e9ponse de M. Tarnawski \u00e9tait que oui, il se souvenait de la voix et de la pr\u00e9sence de M. Turner. Comme je l'ai not\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, M. Tarnawski \u00e9tait l'un des membres du jury de s\u00e9lection qui avait fait passer l'entrevue \u00e0 M. Turner en f\u00e9vrier 2003 pour le concours Victoria 7012.\n[74] T\u00f4t dans l'entrevue, le jury de s\u00e9lection a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner s'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour ce poste pendant la p\u00e9riode d'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans l'affiche du concours. M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu que non, puisque sa compr\u00e9hension et son interpr\u00e9tation \u00e9taient que le poste \u00e9tait pour Vancouver.\n[75] Le jury de s\u00e9lection lui a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, si les dossiers de l'ASFC indiquaient qu'il avait bien pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste depuis le 1er janvier 2002, il ne serait plus admissible pour le concours.\n[76] Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, le jury de s\u00e9lection a effectu\u00e9 une recherche dans ses dossiers et a remarqu\u00e9 que M. Turner avait bel et bien pass\u00e9 l'entrevue pour deux concours d'ID depuis le 1er janvier 2002, soit Victoria 7009 le 2 avril 2002, et Victoria 7012 le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003.\n[77] Bien que M. Turner ait r\u00e9ussi l'entrevue, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 disqualifi\u00e9 du concours avant la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue parce qu'il \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9.\n[78] Les notes de l'entrevue de M. Turner pour le poste de Vancouver, tenue le 26 avril 2004, montrent qu'il a obtenu une note de passage de 70, suivie de la remarque : [Traduction] Non qualifi\u00e9 pour l'entrevue. Vis\u00e9 par la restriction sur l'affiche .\n[79] M. Turner a contest\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision, soutenant que d'autres candidats avaient pass\u00e9 l'entrevue pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e0 Victoria. Selon lui, ces candidats \u00e9taient Trent Van Helvoirt, Health Larivi\u00e8re, Mike Curtis et Chris Hughes. Cependant, il semble, selon la preuve, que ces quatre personnes avaient subi l'entrevue pour Victoria et s'\u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9es.\n[80] Peu apr\u00e8s son entrevue, M. Tarnawski a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner et lui a expliqu\u00e9 que comme il ne s'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 dans un concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00e0 Victoria, pendant la p\u00e9riode de restriction, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 du processus de concours pour Vancouver. Il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Turner que la restriction ne s'appliquait pas aux candidats qui avaient pass\u00e9 l'entrevue et avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus dans un concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent pour Victoria.\n[81] M. Tarnawski a ensuite envoy\u00e9 une lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er juin 2004, que M. Turner a re\u00e7ue le 7 juin 2004. La lettre faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au concours Vancouver 1002 et expliquait que [Traduction] En raison d'une restriction sur l'affiche d'emploi pour le poste d'inspecteur des douanes, les candidats qui ont pass\u00e9 l'entrevue pour le poste susmentionn\u00e9 depuis le 1er janvier 2002 ne seront pas admissibles pour le concours. Nous avons d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que vous avez pass\u00e9 une entrevue apr\u00e8s cette date et que vous n'\u00eates pas admissible pour le pr\u00e9sent concours. Si vous souhaitez obtenir de plus amples renseignements, veuillez envoyer une demande par \u00e9crit d'ici le 9 juin 2004.\n[82] M. Turner a envoy\u00e9 une lettre en r\u00e9ponse dat\u00e9e du 7 juin 2004. Le tampon dateur de l'ASFC indique que la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue le 11 juin 2004. Dans sa lettre, M. Turner demandait de plus amples renseignements. Il notait que dans une conversation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, M. Tarnawski lui avait dit qu'il \u00e9tait disqualifi\u00e9 parce qu'il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu lors des concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour Victoria. Cependant, selon la lettre du 1er juin 2004 de M. Tarnawski, tout candidat qui avait pass\u00e9 l'entrevue, avec succ\u00e8s ou non, serait disqualifi\u00e9.\n[83] M. Turner Turner n'a pas re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa lettre de la part de l'ASFC. Selon M. Tarnawski, c'est parce que la lettre de M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue apr\u00e8s la date pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e pour les demandes de renseignements. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'ASFC essayait de s'assurer que les personnes qui demandaient de la r\u00e9troaction \u00e9taient s\u00e9rieuses au sujet de leur demande\n[84] Il a reconnu que M. Turner avait soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations importantes, mais il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [Traduction] Si c'est en retard, c'est en retard . Cependant, sa lettre du 1er juin 2004 ne pr\u00e9cisait pas que la demande de renseignements devait \u00eatre re\u00e7ue au plus tard le 9 juin 2004, seulement qu'elle devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au plus tard \u00e0 cette date.\nF. Shalivi Sharma [85] Shalivi Sharma a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l'ASFC. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 le concours Vancouver 1002 a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9, elle \u00e9tait agente de ressourcement de l'ASFC et ses clients comprenaient les gestionnaires recruteurs des douanes continentales pour le district Pacific Highway, le district de l'A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver et le district maritime du Grand Vancouver. Elle aidait ses clients \u00e0 composer les jurys de s\u00e9lection ainsi qu'\u00e0 former les membres du jury de s\u00e9lection et elle leur donnait des conseils g\u00e9n\u00e9raux sur la dotation.\n[86] Mme Sharma avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9bauche de l'affiche pour le concours Vancouver 1002. Lorsqu'elle a rencontr\u00e9 l'unit\u00e9 d'embauche pour la premi\u00e8re fois, qui \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9e de Ron Tarnawski et de Mark Northcott, ils lui ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'ils voyaient les m\u00eames candidats en entrevue \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, et que ces candidats n'\u00e9taient pas qualifi\u00e9s pour le poste.\n[87] \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, plusieurs concours avaient lieu en m\u00eame temps afin de r\u00e9gler la p\u00e9nurie d'inspecteurs des douanes et le haut taux de roulement. Ils avaient donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que quiconque ne s'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9, depuis le 1er janvier 2002, non seulement pour Vancouver, mais aussi pour Victoria, ne serait pas admis \u00e0 ce concours, parce que trop peu de temps se serait \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis leur dernier concours pour am\u00e9liorer leurs capacit\u00e9s.\n[88] Mme Sharma a reconnu que l'affiche aurait d\u00fb pr\u00e9ciser que les candidats qui avaient subi l'entrevue depuis le 1er janvier 2002 et qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus n'\u00e9taient pas admissibles au concours. Le d\u00e9faut de clarifier l'intention \u00e9tait une erreur de sa part.\n[89] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sharma si un jury de s\u00e9lection devait tenir compte de l'exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente et des examens de rendement d'un employ\u00e9 qui occupait d\u00e9j\u00e0 le poste, et elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne conseillerait pas au jury de s\u00e9lection de le faire. Parce qu'il s'agissait aussi d'un processus externe, il ne serait pas appropri\u00e9 de tenir compte du rendement d'un candidat interne. Un candidat externe n'aurait pas cet avantage. Tous les candidats devaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s en fonction des m\u00eames crit\u00e8res.\nG. Le programme de transition pour \u00e9tudiants [90] Mme Sharma a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du programme de transition pour \u00e9tudiants. Il s'agit d'un programme pour les \u00e9tudiants qui ont travaill\u00e9 pour l'ASFC alors qu'ils terminaient leurs \u00e9tudes et qui ont obtenu leur dipl\u00f4me. Ils sont alors admissibles \u00e0 la transition sans concours dans un poste d'ASFC ind\u00e9termin\u00e9.\n[91] Ce processus comporte une \u00e9valuation en fonction de l'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite. Le gestionnaire recruteur d\u00e9termine si le candidat satisfait \u00e0 chacune des qualifications qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies. Le programme est g\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Commission de la fonction publique.\n[92] Il n'y a aucun minimum d'ann\u00e9es de travail pour le programme de transition. Dans le programme pour \u00e9tudiants, les \u00e9tudiants sont embauch\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on saisonni\u00e8re, mais certains \u00e9tudiants restent pendant leur trimestre d'automne et d'hiver, \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[93] Entre 2000 et 2005, moins de 10 \u00e9tudiants ont eu droit \u00e0 une telle transition. Depuis 2005, le total a augment\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 20 ou 30 par ann\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique.\n[94] Mme Sharma ne consid\u00e8re pas que le programme de transition est un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel pour les personnes de moins de 35 ans, mais elle reconnait que la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudiants dans ce programme ont moins de 35 ans.\n[95] Ross Fairweather a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 pour l'ASFC au sujet de la question de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge. Il est le conseiller principal en politiques par int\u00e9rim pour la Division de l'armement de l'ASFC et il travaille pour cette agence, et les agences pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, depuis environ 30 ans.\n[96] En 2004, il \u00e9tait chef par int\u00e9rim \u00e0 l'A\u00e9roport international de Vancouver, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des voyageurs de l'A\u00e9roport international. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 Victoria pour parler \u00e0 certains des ID et il aurait cens\u00e9ment dit \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque [Traduction] Si vous avez moins de 35 ans et que vous souhaitez poursuivre une carri\u00e8re en douanes, venez \u00e0 Vancouver . Il soutient qu'il n'aurait jamais dit une telle chose. Il n'est d'ailleurs pas au courant d'une politique d'embauche pour les personnes de moins de 35 ans au sein de l'ASFC ou de agences pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\n[97] En fait, M. Fairweather soutient que c'est plut\u00f4t le contraire. Il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis, tout comme plusieurs de ses coll\u00e8gues, qu'une certaine exp\u00e9rience de vie est bonne pour les personnes dans ce travail. Elles ont besoin de maturit\u00e9 et de capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 faire intervenir le monde r\u00e9el dans les d\u00e9cisions qu'elles prennent au sujet des voyageurs qui proviennent de l'\u00e9tranger.\n[98] M. Fairweather soutient qu'il croit qu'il faut un m\u00e9lange. Il a declar\u00e9 que l'ASFC a des agents qui sont embauch\u00e9s par le programme de transition et qu'il a aussi embauch\u00e9 des agents matures qui ont travaill\u00e9 pendant des ann\u00e9es dans d'autres professions. \u00c0 son avis, le programme de transition n'\u00e9tait pas une grande source de recrutement.\nH. Le surintendant Ron Tarnawski [99] M. Tarnawski est un surintendant \u00e0 la travers\u00e9e des camions du Pacific Highway situ\u00e9e dans le district du Pacifique. Il a travaill\u00e9 pour l'ADRC et l'ASFC pendant environ 19 ans.\n[100] M. Tarnawski a soutenu que, par le pass\u00e9, chaque district de la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique \u00e9tait responsable de sa propre embauche et d'\u00e9tablir son propre processus de s\u00e9lection et d'\u00e9valuation. Il y avait des incoh\u00e9rences dans la fa\u00e7on dont les processus \u00e9taient g\u00e9r\u00e9s et aucune exp\u00e9rience n'\u00e9tait transf\u00e9r\u00e9e d'un processus \u00e0 un autre.\n[101] Les concours \u00e9taient aussi tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9titifs et il arrivait qu'un district offre un poste \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s qui avaient particip\u00e9 au concours d'un autre district et qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus. Les gestionnaires recruteurs attendaient qu'un bassin soit cr\u00e9\u00e9, puis ils se ruaient sur le bassin.\n[102] Il a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir une unit\u00e9 d'embauche qui s'occuperait de tous les processus de s\u00e9lection pour toute la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique. Cette id\u00e9e a \u00e9volu\u00e9 en centre national de recrutement, et un processus national de recrutement dans les bureaux r\u00e9gionaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli dans tout le pays. Pour ce processus, des unit\u00e9s de recrutement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies et un processus d'entrevue normalis\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u en fonction duquel un candidat s'inscrit en ligne. Les candidatures sont pr\u00e9s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9es par des personnes qui ont de l'exp\u00e9rience dans la s\u00e9lection pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[103] M. Tarnawski a discut\u00e9 de la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 pour le concours Vancouver 1002. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette restriction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e parce qu'ils voyaient les m\u00eames candidats d'un processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e0 un autre. La grande majorit\u00e9 de ces candidats n'\u00e9taient pas qualifi\u00e9s et ils se pr\u00e9sentaient \u00e0 une autre entrevue peu de temps apr\u00e8s, d\u00e8s le prochain processus de s\u00e9lection. Les candidats ne prenaient pas avantage de l'occasion ou n'avaient pas le temps de perfectionner les capacit\u00e9s requises. Il s'agissait d'une situation qui \u00e9tait devenue tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 g\u00e9rer.\n[104] M. Tarnawski a reconnu que le libell\u00e9 de la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas clair. Il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9crit que les candidats qui avaient pass\u00e9 l'entrevue pour le poste et qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus n'\u00e9taient pas admissibles pour le concours.\n[105] M. Tarnawski a rencontr\u00e9 M. Turner pour la premi\u00e8re fois alors que ce dernier \u00e9tait l'un des quatre candidats qu'il a re\u00e7us en entrevue pour le concours Victoria 7012 le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003. Il a particip\u00e9 au processus d'entrevue parce que Victoria tenait le concours et avait besoin d'aide de l'unit\u00e9 de recrutement sur la fa\u00e7on d'appliquer le nouveau processus national.\n[106] Quant \u00e0 l'application de la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 ainsi qu'\u00e0 la v\u00e9rification que les candidats ne tombaient pas entre les mailles, M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il fallait v\u00e9rifier manuellement les bases de donn\u00e9es des processus de s\u00e9lection pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents et les comparer \u00e0 la base de donn\u00e9es du processus Vancouver 1002. Mme Sharma et ses employ\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9 ce travail et ont surlign\u00e9 les noms des candidats qui s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 des concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents au cours de la p\u00e9riode d'admissibilit\u00e9.\n[107] M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que comme la base de donn\u00e9es \u00e9tait en cours de conception, les comparaisons avaient lieu au fur et \u00e0 mesure. Parfois, la comparaison n'\u00e9tait effectu\u00e9e que quelque temps apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du processus de s\u00e9lection, selon la date o\u00f9 les renseignements \u00e9taient disponibles. \u00c0 moins qu'un candidat soit retir\u00e9 avant l'entrevue, l'admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00e9termin\u00e9e lors de l'entrevue.\n[108] M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un processus parfait. Les listes de candidats comportaient des centaines de noms et l'unit\u00e9 avait des ressources limit\u00e9es pour traiter le grand volume de candidats.\n[109] M. Tarnawski a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait reconnu M. Turner \u00e0 l'entrevue pour le concours Vancouver 1002 comme un candidat qui avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 un concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, mais il ne se souvenait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment duquel. Cependant, il a fortement ni\u00e9 la suggestion qu'il avait reconnu M. Turner parce qu'il est un homme de race noire et en raison de sa taille.\n[110] M. Tarnawski se souvenait plut\u00f4t que M. Turner \u00e9tait une personne tr\u00e8s \u00e9nergique, avec une personnalit\u00e9 positive et que c'est pour cette raison qu'il \u00e9tait facile de se souvenir de lui comme \u00e9tant l'un des quatre candidats qu'il avait re\u00e7us en entrevue le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003. C'est pourquoi apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, le jury de s\u00e9lection a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire un suivi au sujet de l'admissibilit\u00e9 de M. Turner. M. Tarnawski ne se souvient pas si le jury de s\u00e9lection a effectu\u00e9 un tel suivi au sujet d'un autre candidat pour d\u00e9terminer s'il \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la restriction.\nI. Comment la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e? [111] Pour d\u00e9terminer si la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les candidats pour le concours Vancouver 1002, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Sharma de fournir la liste ma\u00eetresse de tous les candidats qui avaient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur candidature pour le concours Vancouver 1002 et qui avaient pass\u00e9 une entrevue pour d'autres concours depuis le 1er janvier 1002. Elle a produit quatre listes : Vancouver 1002, Victoria 7003, Victoria 7012 et Victoria 1020.\n[112] Les listes ma\u00eetresses \u00e9num\u00e9raient cens\u00e9ment toutes les candidatures re\u00e7ues pour chacun de ces concours, listes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9es \u00e0 la date de cl\u00f4ture de l'affiche, lorsque toutes les candidatures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues, et qui refl\u00e9taient tous les candidats qui avaient particip\u00e9 au concours. La liste ma\u00eetresse \u00e9tait mise \u00e0 jour \u00e0 mesure que l'unit\u00e9 de recrutement avan\u00e7ait dans le processus de v\u00e9rification des personnes, les invitant pour le test, les entrevues, et ainsi de suite.\n[113] La preuve n'indique pas les dates d'affichage et de fermeture pour le concours Victoria 1020, ni si elles relevaient de la restriction. De toute fa\u00e7on, cela n'a aucune importance parce que les donn\u00e9es indiquent que tous les candidats qui ont particip\u00e9 au concours Victoria 1020 et Vancouver 1002 n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi le PdC et, par cons\u00e9quent, n'auraient pas pass\u00e9 l'entrevue.\n[114] Pour les autres concours, les listes ma\u00eetresses indiquent ce qui suit. Vingt et un candidats ont particip\u00e9 au concours Vancouver 1002. De ce nombre, certains ont aussi particip\u00e9 au concours Victoria 7012 ou au concours Victoria 7003 ou aux deux. M. Turner a particip\u00e9 aux trois concours.\n[115] De ces 21 personnes, seuls deux noms, Laura Keble et Blaine Wiggins, soulevaient des doutes au sujet de l'application \u00e9gale de la restriction. Apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification, cependant, la preuve montre que Mme Keble a particip\u00e9 au concours Victoria 7012, mais elle ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9e pour son PdC. Cela ne la disqualifiait pas du concours Vancouver 1002, parce qu'elle n'avait pas pass\u00e9 d'entrevue. Elle s'est qualifi\u00e9e pour le concours Vancouver 1002.\n[116] Le statut de Blaine Wiggins est plus probl\u00e9matique. Il ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 l'entrevue pour le concours Victoria 7012, pourtant, il a pass\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue du concours Vancouver 1002, mais il ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape.\n[117] Il existe deux possibilit\u00e9s pour cette situation. Soit M. Wiggins \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la restriction et n'aurait pas d\u00fb passer l'entrevue du concours Vancouver 1002, soit la liste ma\u00eetresse indique deux adresses diff\u00e9rentes pour M. Wiggins dans les deux concours diff\u00e9rents.\n[118] La conclusion qui d\u00e9coule de ces donn\u00e9es est qu'aucun candidat ayant \u00e9chou\u00e9 l'entrevue pour les concours Victoria 1020, 7012 ou 7003 n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu pour le concours Vancouver 1002, sauf possiblement M. Wiggins, mais il n'est pas certain qu'il s'agisse du m\u00eame candidat dans les deux concours.\nJ. Le concours Victoria 7003 [119] Il s'agissait d'un concours pour un poste d'ID \u00e0 Victoria. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 le 11 octobre 2003 et \u00e9tait ouvert aux personnes qui habitaient ou travaillaient dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Victoria.\n[120] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature pour ce poste parce que c'\u00e9tait la fin de son contrat saisonnier et qu'il tentait d'\u00eatre retenu dans un r\u00e9pertoire de candidats pr\u00e9qualifi\u00e9s afin de s'assurer qu'il serait r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 suivant. Il voulait aussi s'assurer que, si des postes permanents \u00e9taient offerts, il serait pr\u00eat pour en obtenir un.\n[121] Le processus \u00e9tait le m\u00eame que pour le concours Vancouver 1002. M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue pour le concours Victoria 7003, qui a eu lieu le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2003. \u00c0 l'entrevue, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9.\n[122] Le jury de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 des surintendants Baird et Kathryn Pringle. \u00c0 l'entrevue, le jury de s\u00e9lection a examin\u00e9 les pr\u00e9tentions de M. Turner pour deux comp\u00e9tences, soit la communication interactive efficace et le travail d'\u00e9quipe et la collaboration. Il a obtenu une note de 60 pour la communication interactive efficace et de 40 pour le travail d'\u00e9quipe et la collaboration. Une note de passage de 70 \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour chacune des comp\u00e9tences.\n[123] Le surintendant Baird a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience au sujet de l'entrevue de M. Turner et des notes d'entrevue du jury de s\u00e9lection.\n[124] Pour la communication interactive efficace, le jury de s\u00e9lection a inscrit dans ses notes : [traduction] embellit les faits, a dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 policier alors qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 qu'un auxiliaire b\u00e9n\u00e9vole. A d\u00e9crit les autres de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative dans son document \u00e9crit . Dans son t\u00e9moignage, le surintendant Baird a expliqu\u00e9 que pendant l'entrevue, M. Turner avait sembl\u00e9 indiquer d'abord qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 agent de police pour le service de police du Grand Toronto. Plus tard dans l'entrevue, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 auxiliaire b\u00e9n\u00e9vole.\n[125] Le jury de s\u00e9lection a conclu qu'il s'agissait d'un exemple o\u00f9 il n'avait pas communiqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on claire, alors que le jury recherchait une communication tr\u00e8s claire, concise et exacte.\n[126] Le jury de s\u00e9lection a aussi mentionn\u00e9 dans ses notes quelques exemples que M. Turner avait fournis pour la partie du travail d'\u00e9quipe et de la coop\u00e9ration. Un des exemples portait sur un probl\u00e8me informatique qui \u00e9tait survenu lors d'un de ses quarts de travail au CDT. Il semblerait qu'aucun des experts en informatique \u00e0 Victoria et \u00e0 Ottawa n'\u00e9tait en mesure de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me. Selon l'exemple de M. Turner, le probl\u00e8me a m\u00eame frustr\u00e9 un agent exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 du CDT, qui a abandonn\u00e9 toute tentative de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me.\n[127] Puis, M. Turner a \u00e9crit qu'il s'est pench\u00e9 sur la question lorsqu'il est devenu \u00e9vident que le probl\u00e8me devait \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa, a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 un responsable de l'informatique, qui est devenu frustr\u00e9. M. Turner lui a dit qu'il s'occuperait du probl\u00e8me et, finalement, le probl\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9.\n[128] Un autre exemple que M. Turner a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour la comp\u00e9tence du travail d'\u00e9quipe et de la coop\u00e9ration (composer avec des situations difficiles) portait sur un homme de race noire qui est arriv\u00e9 au Canada un apr\u00e8s-midi sur le transbordeur Coho. Il est devenu agit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s que l'ID lui eut pos\u00e9 quelques questions et, comme M. Turner l'a d\u00e9crit dans son exemple : [traduction] j'ai remarqu\u00e9 que Nina [Patel] tentait de lui parler et de le calmer, mais il ne l'aimait pas du tout [...] j'ai intervenu et j'ai remplac\u00e9 Nina, elle a recul\u00e9 et a tenu les autres \u00e0 l'\u00e9cart pendant que je r\u00e9glais la situation [...] .\n[129] M. Turner a ajout\u00e9 que [traduction] l'inspecteur Ken Moore a fait v\u00e9rifier la voiture par le chien Lego et le voyageur s'est \u00e9lev\u00e9 contre ce fait. \u00c0 ce moment l\u00e0, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ramasser tous les articles qui \u00e9taient sur le sol pour l'inspection et les a remis dans le v\u00e9hicule. Ken s'est f\u00e2ch\u00e9 et a attrap\u00e9 un coin du sac d'outils que le voyageur essayait de remettre dans le v\u00e9hicule. Ken l'a regard\u00e9 dans les yeux et lui a dit, d'un ton agressif : j'aurai termin\u00e9 quand je dirai que j'ai termin\u00e9 .\n[130] M. Turner a d\u00e9crit comment il s'est interpos\u00e9 entre les deux hommes et les a s\u00e9par\u00e9s. Il a amen\u00e9 le voyageur \u00e0 l'avant du v\u00e9hicule. \u00c0 son avis, il semblait que la situation allait d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer en bagarre \u00e0 coups de poing.\n[131] M. Turner a ajout\u00e9 qu'il s'est rendu au bureau d'immigration et a trouv\u00e9 les documents n\u00e9cessaires. Les agents d'immigration ne l'ont pas tellement aid\u00e9, mais il a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 trouver les documents pertinents.\n[132] Le jury de s\u00e9lection a not\u00e9 que M. Turner avait une attitude tr\u00e8s n\u00e9gative envers ses coll\u00e8gues et ses superviseurs dans cet exemple. Il avait tendance \u00e0 embellir les faits et \u00e0 sur\u00e9valuer son r\u00f4le aux d\u00e9pens des autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes. Il a diminu\u00e9 leur participation de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu'il semble que seul M. Turner \u00e9tait en mesure de r\u00e9gler la situation.\n[133] Les notes du jury de s\u00e9lection mentionnent aussi le fait que M. Turner n'\u00e9tait pas d'accord avec le surintendant principal, qui avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de facturer au Coho des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le surintendant principal voulait facturer le Coho en recouvrement de co\u00fbts parce que le transbordeur \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 en retard. Les agents devaient \u00eatre sur place \u00e0 une certaine heure, mais comme le transbordeur \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 en retard, les agents ont d\u00fb faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[134] M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne souscrivait pas \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision et \u00e0 expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi lors de l'entrevue. Sa r\u00e9ponse a incit\u00e9 le jury de s\u00e9lection \u00e0 \u00e9crire : [traduction] N'\u00e9tait pas d'accord avec le surintendant principal qui a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de facturer au Coho des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. A tir\u00e9 une conclusion sans obtenir tous les faits, attribue rapidement le bl\u00e2me et saute aux conclusions.\n[135] Dans son PdC, M. Turner avait inscrit Nina Patel et Ken Moore comme personnes qui pouvaient valider son exemple pour le travail d'\u00e9quipe et la coop\u00e9ration. M. Turner a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait conscient qu'apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, il \u00e9tait possible que le jury de s\u00e9lection communique avec ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences pour confirmer la justesse des circonstances d\u00e9crites.\n[136] Le surintendant Baird a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les renseignements qu'il connaissait \u00e0 propos de Mme Patel \u00e9taient qu'elle \u00e9tait une agente qui avait beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience dans le traitement de voyageurs hostiles et agressifs dans des situations tr\u00e8s charg\u00e9es. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 inhabituel pour elle de s'effacer et de laisser M. Turner r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me. Quant \u00e0 Ken Moore, le surintendant Baird a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il est un ma\u00eetre-chien exp\u00e9riment\u00e9 qui a trait\u00e9 avec de nombreux voyageurs hostiles. La description que M. Turner a faite des actions de M. Moore ne co\u00efncidaient pas avec les observations de M. Baird au sujet du travail de Ken Moore.\n[137] Le surintendant Baird a bien communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Patel environ un mois plus tard, soit en janvier 2004, pour valider l'exemple que M. Turner avait fourni. Il s'\u00e9tait senti oblig\u00e9 de le faire parce que l'exemple de M. Turner \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s inhabituel par rapport \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont Mme Patel travaillait normalement, selon ce qu'il avait remarqu\u00e9.\n[138] Il se souvient avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Patel, qui se trouvait au centre de formation de l'ASFC \u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec. Il ne lui a pas donn\u00e9 de copie du PdC. Il lui a lu l'exemple au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et elle lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses commentaires.\n[139] Le surintendant Baird a pris des notes de cette conversation et des commentaires de Mme Patel. Ses notes indiquent que M. Turner avait bien parl\u00e9 au voyageur et qu'il avait fait du bon travail, mais que son intervention n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9terminante. Mme Patel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les autres agents sous un mauvais jour pour rehausser sa propre image. Elle \u00e9tait d'avis qu'elle avait gard\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le de la situation et du voyageur.\n[140] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il avait choisi de valider les renseignements un mois apr\u00e8s la disqualification de M. Turner, le surintendant Baird a confirm\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas tenu de le faire. Cependant, M. Turner avait offert les noms de Mme Patel et de M. Moore pour valider son exemple.\n[141] Le surintendant Baird a reconnu que, dans son \u00e9valuation de mi-saison de M. Turner, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait satisfait de ses capacit\u00e9s de communication interactive efficace. \u00c0 titre de superviseur de M. Turner, il n'avait jamais eu de pr\u00e9occupation au sujet de sa sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[142] Il a aussi confirm\u00e9 que M. Turner poss\u00e8dait des aptitudes de communication efficace avec le public, qu'il posait des questions, qu'il \u00e9coutait les r\u00e9ponses et qu'avec une bonne application de ces aptitudes et un d\u00e9ploiement d'efforts dans les inspections secondaires, M. Turner poss\u00e8dait le potentiel de d\u00e9velopper cet ensemble d'aptitudes afin de devenir un bon intervieweur. Cependant, il n'\u00e9tait pas encore rendu \u00e0 ce point.\nII. La d\u00e9cision [143] Pour que sa plainte soit accueillie, M. Turner doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur les motifs illicites de l'\u00e2ge et de l'origine nationale ou ethnique telle qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans sa plainte.\n[144] Pour la question de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge, la preuve ne permet pas \u00e0 M. Turner d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. Une preuve statistique comparant les donn\u00e9es d\u00e9mographiques sur l'\u00e2ge de l'ADRC\/ASFC \u00e0 celles de l'ensemble de la fonction publique et de la population active en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Ces statistiques \u00e9taient non concluantes. Qui plus est, aucun des avocats n'a mentionn\u00e9 ces statistiques dans ses conclusions finales.\n[145] L'autre preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Turner \u00e9tait un commentaire que M. Fairweather aurait cens\u00e9ment fait, selon lequel les personnes de moins de 35 ans qui souhaitaient \u00e9tablir une carri\u00e8re en douanes n'avaient qu'\u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Fairweather a ni\u00e9 avoir fait ce commentaire et a soutenu qu'il ne connaissait pas de politique selon laquelle les candidats de moins de 35 ans \u00e9taient pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s aux autres. En fait, \u00e0 son avis, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable d'avoir un m\u00e9lange d'ID de tous les \u00e2ges et qui poss\u00e9daient des exp\u00e9riences diff\u00e9rentes.\n[146] Le programme de transition pour les \u00e9tudiants ne soutient pas non plus l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge. Bien que le programme vise l'embauche de jeunes candidats dans les postes d'ID, la preuve montre qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une source importante de recrutement des ID. Entre 2000 et 2005, moins de 10 ID ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ce programme et apr\u00e8s 2005, de 20 \u00e0 30 ID ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9gion du Pacifique.\n[147] Quant \u00e0 la race et \u00e0 l'origine nationale ou ethnique, sauf pour un ramassis de preuves statistiques \u00e9parpill\u00e9es, d\u00e9routantes et non concluantes (que M. Turner a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en preuve, mais que ni l'une ni l'autre partie n'a plaid\u00e9es), il n'existait aucune preuve de discrimination directe.\n[148] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, M. Turner doit se fonder sur des preuves circonstancielles et des inf\u00e9rences quant \u00e0 la discrimination. L'ASFC accepte que dans un cas comme celui en l'esp\u00e8ce, qui comprend des preuves circonstancielles, le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer est le suivant : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se.\n[149] M. Turner a cibl\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants de la preuve \u00e0 l'appui d'une inf\u00e9rence de discrimination :\nA. Ses qualifications et son exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre d'inspecteur des douanes [150] M. Turner a travaill\u00e9 comme ID saisonnier de 1998 \u00e0 2003, pour un total de six saisons. Ses examens de rendement ont toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 positifs, en particulier au sujet de la communication interactive efficace et du travail d'\u00e9quipe et de la coop\u00e9ration. Dans chaque examen, on a recommand\u00e9 sa r\u00e9embauche \u00e0 la prochaine saison.\n[151] Son contrat a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 d'octobre 2001 \u00e0 octobre 2002, ce qui satisfaisait aux crit\u00e8res de l'exp\u00e9rience au CDT, de la fiabilit\u00e9, du travail d'\u00e9quipe et de la coop\u00e9ration. Cependant, il ne s'est jamais qualifi\u00e9 pour un poste d'ID permanent, malgr\u00e9 toute son exp\u00e9rience et ses examens de rendement constamment positifs.\nB. Les courriels Klassen [152] Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment porte sur la discussion que M. Turner a eue avec le surintendant Klassen apr\u00e8s son examen de rendement, dans laquelle M. Klassen a avis\u00e9 M. Turner de la perception que certains surintendants avaient de lui, \u00e0 savoir qu'il semblait paresseux, qu'il cherchait \u00e0 \u00e9viter du travail et qu'il \u00e9tait malhonn\u00eate. M. Turner soutient qu'il s'agit d'une perception st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9e et n\u00e9gative des hommes de race noire.\n[153] Apr\u00e8s cette discussion, M. Klassen a envoy\u00e9 un courriel aux surintendants dans lequel il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 l'objet de la conversation. Il a ensuite envoy\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me courriel dans lequel il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 certains sujets qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans son premier courriel.\n[154] M. Klassenn a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait envoy\u00e9 ces courriels pour fournir aux surintendants des renseignements qui pourraient servir au gestionnaire de M. Turner \u00e0 la prochaine saison, pour \u00e9tablir ses priorit\u00e9s et ses objectifs. M. Klassen n'avait jamais mentionn\u00e9 ces pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 M. Turner auparavant. Il n'a pas envoy\u00e9 de courriel semblable au sujet d'un autre employ\u00e9 saisonnier.\nC. Le concours Victoria 7003 [155] M. Turner ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9 parce qu'il n'a pas obtenu la note requise de 70 pour les comp\u00e9tences de communication interactive efficace et de travail d'\u00e9quipe et de coop\u00e9ration, malgr\u00e9 le fait que deux des membres du jury de s\u00e9lection, les surintendants Baird et Pringle, lui avaient donn\u00e9 de bonnes notes dans ses examens de rendement pour ces deux comp\u00e9tences.\n[156] De plus, le jury de s\u00e9lection croyait qu'il avait embelli son exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure en services policiers, ou qu'il avait menti \u00e0 ce sujet, alors que son CV montrait clairement qu'il n'avait travaill\u00e9 que comme auxiliaire.\n[157] Les surintendants Pringle et Baird \u00e9taient aussi d'avis que M. Turner manquait d'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res. M. Turner a r\u00e9pondu en d\u00e9ployant des efforts pr\u00e9cis afin de travailler \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du CDT dans l'\u00e9quipe d'intervention maritime pour combler ce manque. Le surintendant Baird l'a f\u00e9licit\u00e9 parce qu'il avait mis ses recommandations en pratique.\n[158] En janvier 2004, le surintendant Baird a communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Patel pour valider le PdC de M. Turner. Cette communication a eu lieu environ un mois apr\u00e8s la disqualification de M. Turner du concours, et le surintendant Baird a reconnu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de faire ce suivi. Il n'a fait aucun suivi aupr\u00e8s des validateurs des autres candidats.\nD. Le concours Vancouver 1002 [159] \u00c0 l'entrevue, lorsque M. Turner a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait rencontr\u00e9 M. Tarnawski auparavant, ce dernier a r\u00e9pondu qu'il se souvenait de la voix et de la pr\u00e9sence de M. Turner.\n[160] M. Tarnawski et Mme Sharma ont tous les deux reconnu qu'ils ont appliqu\u00e9 la restriction conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leur intention et non au libell\u00e9 de l'affiche.\n[161] Bien que des centaines de candidats se soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au concours Vancouver 1002, M. Tarnawski a admis qu'il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s probable que M. Turner ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul candidat qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9 en raison de la restriction. Il \u00e9tait aussi le seul candidat au sujet duquel le jury de s\u00e9lection a effectu\u00e9 une v\u00e9rification afin de confirmer s'il \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la restriction.\n[162] Enfin, M. Turner a soulev\u00e9 le fait que M. Tarnawski a insist\u00e9 pour maintenir la date fix\u00e9e pour la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre de rejet et qu'il a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la lettre du 7 juin 2004 dans laquelle M. Turner demandait plus de renseignements. Il a insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu'il avait soulev\u00e9 des incoh\u00e9rences dans les explications de M. Tarnawski au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la restriction et que M. Tarnawski avait reconnu qu'il s'agissait d'une demande s\u00e9rieuse et l\u00e9gitime.\n[163] Aux fins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, je supposerai que M. Turner a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. J'examinerai maintenant si l'ASFC a fourni une explication pour le fait qu'elle n'a pas offert \u00e0 M. Turner un poste d'ID ind\u00e9termin\u00e9 et si cette explication est raisonnable et ne sert pas de pr\u00e9texte.\n[164] L'ASFC soutient que la position de M. Turner en revient \u00e0 dire que ses emplois saisonniers et ses examens de rendement positifs prouvent qu'il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste d'ID. La seule inf\u00e9rence possible du fait qu'il n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 se qualifier dans un concours pour ce poste d\u00e9coule de sa race ou de son origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[165] L'ASFC accepte que les examens de rendement de M. Turner \u00e9taient positifs. Cependant, ces examens portaient sur son rendement comme employ\u00e9 saisonnier nomm\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode d\u00e9termin\u00e9e. La preuve montre que les postes d'ID ind\u00e9termin\u00e9s sont dot\u00e9s \u00e0 partir d'un processus de s\u00e9lection par voie de concours (sauf pour le transfert des \u00e9tudiants). Pour que M. Turner atteigne son objectif, il doit d\u00e9montrer dans un concours qu'il est qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste.\n[166] Cela explique pourquoi M. Turner n'a pas obtenu le poste d'ID simplement en fonction de son exp\u00e9rience et des mentions \u00e9logieuses. Il n'est pas suffisant qu'il soutienne qu'il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme ID saisonnier en 1998, qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9embauch\u00e9 pendant six saisons et qu'il a re\u00e7u principalement des examens de rendement positifs.\n[167] Dans le concours Vancouver 1002, M. Turner n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour la seconde entrevue parce que l'ASFC a conclu qu'il \u00e9tait vis\u00e9 par la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9. Il ne fait aucun doute que le libell\u00e9 de cette restriction laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer et qu'il n'excluait pas, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, seulement les candidats qui avaient pass\u00e9 l'entrevue, mais n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus lors de concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. M. Tarnawski et Mme Sharma, qui ont tous les deux particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de la restriction, ont reconnu ce fait.\n[168] M. Tarnawski a expliqu\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle les candidats non retenus \u00e9taient exclus \u00e9tait que les jurys de s\u00e9lection recevaient en entrevue les m\u00eames candidats d'un concours \u00e0 l'autre et que la grande majorit\u00e9 de ces candidats n'\u00e9taient pas qualifi\u00e9s. L'objectif de la p\u00e9riode d'attente de deux ans \u00e9tait d'\u00e9viter de recevoir en entrevue les m\u00eames candidats et de leur donner plus de temps pour d\u00e9velopper les capacit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour devenir ID.\n[169] Il est possible que M. Turner ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul candidat au sujet duquel le jury de s\u00e9lection a fait un suivi apr\u00e8s l'entrevue. Il est aussi possible qu'il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le seul candidat vis\u00e9 par la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9.\n[170] Cependant, d'apr\u00e8s les listes ma\u00eetresses pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par Mme Sharma pour les concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents (si l'on fait abstraction du statut douteux de M. Wiggins), M. Turner \u00e9tait le seul candidat inadmissible.\n[171] De plus, il n'est pas logique que la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9 ne s'appliquait qu'aux postes \u00e0 Vancouver, comme M. Turner le croyait, mais qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9largie \u00e0 tous les concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour \u00e9liminer M. Turner. Si l'ASFC ne voulait pas embaucher M. Turner pour des motifs discriminatoires, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus facile de lui accorder une note insuffisante \u00e0 l'entrevue.\n[172] \u00c0 mon avis, le fait que M. Tarnawski ait reconnu M. Turner en raison d'une entrevue pour un concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ne soutient pas non plus une conclusion de discrimination. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tarnawski selon lequel il n'avait re\u00e7u en entrevue que quatre personnes ce jour l\u00e0, le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2003, et qu'il se souvenait de M. Turner environ un an plus tard parce qu'il \u00e9tait une personne tr\u00e8s positive et tr\u00e8s enjou\u00e9e.\n[173] Enfin, \u00e0 mon avis, le fait que M. Tarnawki n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de M. Turner du 7 juin 2004, dans laquelle il demandait plus de renseignements sur l'application de la restriction d'admissibilit\u00e9, constitue une tentative bureaucratique excessive de contr\u00f4ler sa charge de travail. Cela ne peut pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un acte discriminatoire.\n[174] En ce qui a trait au concours Victoria 7003, la surintendante Pringle \u00e9tait l'une des membres du jury de s\u00e9lection qui a interview\u00e9 M. Turner. Apr\u00e8s l'entrevue, elle a pris le temps de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner \u00e0 M. Turner pour lui expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles il n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi l'entrevue. Elle lui a dit qu'il manquait d'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res et elle l'a encourag\u00e9 \u00e0 acqu\u00e9rir plus d'exp\u00e9rience dans ce domaine avant de participer \u00e0 un autre concours.\n[175] Le surintendant Baird, un autre membre du jury de s\u00e9lection, a aussi cibl\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes au sujet du manque d'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res de M. Turner. Comme la surintendante Pringle, il a encourag\u00e9 M. Turner \u00e0 travailler au traitement externe afin de devenir un meilleur intervieweur et d'am\u00e9liorer ses aptitudes en application des mesures douani\u00e8res.\n[176] On peut difficilement conclure qu'il s'agit l\u00e0 d'actions de la part d'un employeur qui faisait preuve de discrimination envers M. Turner. Au contraire, tant la surintendante Pringle que le surintendant Baird ont fait preuve de soutien en encourageant M. Turner et en tentant de l'aider \u00e0 faire avancer sa carri\u00e8re au sein de l'ASFC.\n[177] Comme le surintendant Klassen l'a not\u00e9 dans son examen de rendement de 2003, M. Turner avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 six activit\u00e9s d'application des mesures douani\u00e8res. Cependant, comme il l'a mentionn\u00e9, il s'agissait d'une exp\u00e9rience moyenne pour l'\u00e9t\u00e9 et ne suffisait pas \u00e0 donner \u00e0 M. Turner une bonne compr\u00e9hension de l'application des mesures douani\u00e8res ou un bon fondement pour cette application.\n[178] Ce manque d'exp\u00e9rience en application des mesures douani\u00e8res a certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur n\u00e9gatif dans l'incapacit\u00e9 de M. Turner \u00e0 se qualifier pour un poste d'ID lors de concours pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. Il n'avait pas de bons r\u00e9sultats aux entrevues.\n[179] Les notes du jury de s\u00e9lection pour son dossier d'entrevue au concours Victoria montre que, lorsqu'il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses exemples d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements portant sur le travail d'\u00e9quipe et la coop\u00e9ration, M. Turner a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gatif envers ses coll\u00e8gues. Il a exag\u00e9r\u00e9 son r\u00f4le aux d\u00e9pens des autres personnes pr\u00e9sentes. Il a diminu\u00e9 leur participation afin de montrer qu'il \u00e9tait le seul en mesure de r\u00e9gler une situation difficile.\n[180] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la communication interactive efficace, le jury de s\u00e9lection a senti d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part que M. Turner avait embelli son exp\u00e9rience avec la police du Grand Toronto, qu'il a ensuite clarifi\u00e9e. Le jury de s\u00e9lection lui a donn\u00e9 une faible note parce que sa communication n'\u00e9tait ni claire, ni juste.\n[181] J'ai examin\u00e9 les exemples que M. Turner a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans le contexte du concours et des comp\u00e9tences requises. \u00c0 mon avis, l'\u00e9valuation du jury de s\u00e9lection et les notes accord\u00e9es \u00e0 l'entrevue \u00e9taient raisonnables.\n[182] Je ne rel\u00e8ve rien dans les notes du jury de s\u00e9lection qui pourraient entra\u00eener une inf\u00e9rence selon laquelle M. Turner ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9 pour le poste en raison de motifs discriminatoires. Je ne rel\u00e8ve rien de mauvais augure dans le fait que le surintendant Baird a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Patel apr\u00e8s la disqualification de M. Turner. Ce dernier a fourni le nom de Mme Patel comme personne pouvant valider ses exemples. Selon le surintendant Baird, la description que M. Turner avait faite des actions de Mme Patel semblait tout \u00e0 fait incoh\u00e9rente. Le fait qu'il ait tent\u00e9 d'obtenir sa version des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ne porte aucun relent de discrimination.\n[183] Je conclus que l'ASFC a fourni une explication raisonnable au fait que M. Turner ne s'est pas qualifi\u00e9 pour un poste d'ID ni dans le concours Vancouver 1002, ni dans le concours Victoria 7003. Je conclus aussi que rien dans la preuve ou dans les explications de l'ASFC ne donne \u00e0 penser qu'il s'agissait d'un pr\u00e9texte.\nPour ces motifs, je conclus que la plainte de M. Turner n'est pas justifi\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

LES PRINCIPES DE DROIT R\u00c9GISSANT LA QUESTION\nVII. ANALYSE\nVIII. CONCLUSION: LE POUVOIR DISCR\u00c9TIONNAIRE DU D\u00c9CIDEUR\nI. LA DEMANDE [1] Le R\u00e9seau de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision des peuples autochtones (APTN) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande (entendue par voie de requ\u00eate) pour pouvoir enregistrer une bande audio et vid\u00e9o de l'audience tenue par le Tribunal et diffuser des extraits de ces enregistrements pendant les nouvelles du soir, le m\u00eame jour. Il a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 garder les enregistrements dans ses archives. Les plaignants et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du soutien \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du soutien), l'Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations, les Chiefs of Ontario et Amnistie Internationale) appuient la demande. La Commission ne s'oppose pas \u00e0 la demande, tant qu'une ordonnance soit rendue pour qu'il y ait un d\u00e9lai d'une heure entre la transmission et la diffusion. L'intim\u00e9, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien) (MAINC) s'oppose \u00e0 la demande. APTN, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du soutien et l'intim\u00e9 ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations compl\u00e8tes au sujet de la demande. APTN a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il respecterait la demande de la Commission quant au d\u00e9lai d'au moins une heure. APTN a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un protocole dans lequel il d\u00e9clare qu'il respectera l'ordonnance. Il ajoute aussi que son protocole garantira que sa diffusion sera appropri\u00e9e et se fera dans le respect de la proc\u00e9dure d'audience. Il soutient qu'il fera un compte rendu juste et \u00e9quitable de l'audience, sans la perturber.\n[2] APTN est le seul r\u00e9seau au Canada qui se sp\u00e9cialise uniquement dans les questions autochtones. Son public cible est la communaut\u00e9 autochtone ainsi que les personnes qui suivent les questions touchant cette communaut\u00e9.\nII. LA PROC\u00c9DURE D'AUDIENCE EN COURS [3] L'audition de la plainte suivra la proc\u00e9dure normale du Tribunal. L'audience sera ouverte au public, qui pourra observer toute la proc\u00e9dure. Sauf si une demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), aucune question ne sera entendue \u00e0 huis clos. Les m\u00e9dias pourront assister \u00e0 toute l'audience, prendre des notes et faire des reportages sur l'audience. Le public ne pourra pas apporter de magn\u00e9tophone \u00e0 l'audience. L'audience compl\u00e8te sera enregistr\u00e9e pour les besoins d'arbitrage et l'enregistrement num\u00e9rique de la voix sera fourni au membre instructeur et aux parties, qui pourront l'utiliser pour l'interrogatoire, le contre-interrogatoire et les conclusions finales. Les parties pourront obtenir une transcription de l'audience, \u00e0 partir de l'enregistrement num\u00e9rique de la voix, \u00e0 leurs frais et elles pourront l'utiliser pour les m\u00eames raisons.\n[4] La position de certaines parties quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate n\u00e9cessite une analyse plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e.\nIII. LA POSITION D'APTN [5] APTN a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les arguments suivants :\nOn ne peut insister assez sur l'importance de l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le MAINC agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers les enfants qui habitent dans les communaut\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations en n'accordant pas le m\u00eame financement pour les services sociaux \u00e0 ces enfants qu'il accorde aux autres enfants. L'issue de l'instance aura un effet \u00e9norme sur les vies des familles qui habitent dans les r\u00e9serves au Canada. Le taux pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 d'enfants qui habitent dans une r\u00e9serve et qui sont sous la garde des services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille est huit fois plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui des enfants qui n'habitent pas dans une r\u00e9serve. De plus, tant la v\u00e9rificatrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans son rapport de 2008 que le Comit\u00e9 permanent des comptes publics dans son rapport de 2009 ont soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet du financement du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral pour les services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille destin\u00e9 aux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui habitent dans des r\u00e9serves. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral am\u00e9liore son financement aux services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille dans cinq provinces : l'Alberta, la Saskatchewan, la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, le Qu\u00e9bec et l'\u00cele-du-Prince-\u00c9douard. \u00c0 l'audience, les d\u00e9tails seront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sur la fa\u00e7on dont le financement aidera les enfants et les familles qui habitent dans les r\u00e9serves. Les auditeurs d'APTN sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9s par ces d\u00e9tails ainsi que par tout autre renseignement portant sur la fa\u00e7on dont le MAINC fournira ou am\u00e9liorera le financement aux autres ressorts. La t\u00e9l\u00e9diffusion d\u00e9pend de l'enregistrement audio et vid\u00e9o. Les journalistes d'APTN utilisent des t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras pour enregistrer les nouvelles et les communiquer au public. Emp\u00eacher l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o de l'audience constituerait une infraction injustifiable \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 2b) de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte). La pr\u00e9sence d'APTN n'entra\u00eenera aucune perturbation et donnera \u00e0 tous les Canadiens l'occasion d'obtenir un certain acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'audience \u00e0 laquelle ils ne peuvent pas assister, r\u00e9pondant ainsi \u00e0 l'un des objectifs de la LCDP, soit l'\u00e9ducation.\nIV. LA POSITION DE LA SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9 DU SOUTIEN [6] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du soutien a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les arguments suivants :\nLe public a droit \u00e0 un acc\u00e8s raisonnable aux proc\u00e9dures publiques. De plus, les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations de communaut\u00e9s \u00e9loign\u00e9es partout au Canada ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct dans l'issue de l'affaire et beaucoup d'entre eux n'auront un acc\u00e8s raisonnable \u00e0 l'audience que si elle est t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e sur APTN. La d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience doit \u00eatre prise en fonction des valeurs constitutionnelles du Canada, y compris la libert\u00e9 de communiquer et de recevoir de l'information au sujet des instances judiciaires, l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 pour les groupes traditionnellement d\u00e9favoris\u00e9s et l'importance du respect des traditions des Premi\u00e8res Nations. L'acc\u00e8s t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience respecte le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires et du droit \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s raisonnable \u00e0 l'audience. L'acc\u00e8s t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience donnera \u00e0 tous les peuples des Premi\u00e8res Nations l'acc\u00e8s \u00e9gal \u00e0 l'instance, et le d\u00e9ni d'un tel acc\u00e8s aurait des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur un grand nombre de membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui ne peuvent pas se rendre \u00e0 l'audience en personne en raison des obstacles g\u00e9ographiques et socio-\u00e9conomiques. L'acc\u00e8s t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience favorisera le mandat de la LCDP de sensibiliser le public au sujet de la discrimination et des droits de la personne. La sensibilisation du public \u00e0 ces sujets est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme l'un des objectifs principaux des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et aide \u00e0 favoriser l'objectif premier de la LCDP : l'\u00e9limination de la discrimination. L'acc\u00e8s t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience permettra \u00e0 APTN d'effectuer des reportages au sujet de l'audience d'une mani\u00e8re qui respecte les traditions et la culture des Premi\u00e8res Nations. Les cours canadiennes ont reconnu le fait que le partage oral des connaissances fait partie int\u00e9grante de la culture distincte de nombreuses communaut\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations. L'enregistrement audio et vid\u00e9o de l'audience la rendra plus pertinente et accessible du point de vue culturel. La d\u00e9cision de permettre l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras devrait refl\u00e9ter et respecter les droits ancestraux des Premi\u00e8res Nations ainsi que leurs pratiques traditionnelles, y compris le partage oral des connaissances.\nV. LA POSITION DE L'INTIM\u00c9 [7] L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les arguments suivants :\nL'intim\u00e9 s'oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est respect\u00e9 puisque les m\u00e9dias peuvent rapporter les d\u00e9tails de l'audience. Cet int\u00e9r\u00eat ne comprend pas un droit - constitutionnel ou autre - \u00e0 l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o et \u00e0 la diffusion de l'audience m\u00eame. La pr\u00e9sence de t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras \u00e0 l'audience risque d'affecter les t\u00e9moignages, le comportement des participants et l'atmosph\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'audience. Cela pourrait affecter l'issue de l'audience et compromettre l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure et les objectifs l\u00e9gislatifs du processus d\u00e9cisionnel judiciaire. Les tribunaux ont \u00e0 maintes reprises refus\u00e9 l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. Il existe d'importantes distinctions entre l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o de proc\u00e9dures administratives, quasi-judiciaires et judiciaires d'une part, et l'enregistrement vid\u00e9o d'audiences tenues par des commissions d'enqu\u00eate d'autre part.\nVI. LES PRINCIPES DE DROIT R\u00c9GISSANT LA QUESTION [8] APTN et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments exhaustifs au sujet du fait que le refus de leur permettre de filmer l'audience constituerait une infraction au principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, qui est maintenant garanti par l'article 2 de la Charte. L'intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments exhaustifs \u00e0 l'appui de la pr\u00e9misse selon laquelle l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras n'est pas garanti par l'article 2 de la Charte. La jurisprudence qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e ne me convainc pas que le refus d'accorder l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras constituerait un manquement injustifiable \u00e0 cet aspect de la libert\u00e9 d'expression qui garantit le droit du public d'\u00eatre inform\u00e9, par les m\u00e9dias, des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. Je tire cette conclusion principalement pour les raisons suivantes :\nle refus d'accorder l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras n'emp\u00eache pas APTN de pr\u00e9senter des reportages sur l'instance, mais limite la fa\u00e7on ou la m\u00e9thode dont ces reportages seront effectu\u00e9s;\nde toute fa\u00e7on, comme l'analyse ci-dessous le d\u00e9montrera, je crois que le fait de limiter l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras \u00e0 l'audience - m\u00eame s'il s'agissait d'une preuve prima facie de contravention \u00e0 l'article 2 de la Charte - serait justifiable conform\u00e9ment au test \u00e9tabli dans les arr\u00eats Dagenais c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, 1994 CanLII 39 (C.S.C.), [1994] 3 R.C.S. 835, et R. c. Mentuck, 2001 CSC 76 (CanLII), [2001] 3 R.C.S. 442, 2001 CSC 76. Je tire cette conclusion de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, parce que j'ai not\u00e9 que le fait d'exiger du Tribunal qu'il effectue l'analyse \u00e9tablie dans Dagenais et Mentuck, un t\u00e9moin \u00e0 la fois, ralentirait de fa\u00e7on inacceptable le d\u00e9roulement efficace de l'instance.\n[9] En plus du principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires et de l'article 2 de la Charte, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien invoque aussi les droits et les traditions autochtones confirm\u00e9s par l'article 35 de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, ainsi que les droits d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 garantis par l'article 15 de la Charte. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien pr\u00e9tend que le requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras pendant l'audience n\u00e9cessite une interpr\u00e9tation de la LCDP et que les droits constitutionnels susmentionn\u00e9s devraient inspirer cette interpr\u00e9tation.\n[10] Cependant, je ne suis pas d'avis qu'en rendant une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate, j'applique ou j'interpr\u00e8te une disposition de la LCDP. La LCDP n'interdit pas et n'exige pas l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras. L'article 52 suppose que l'instruction sera publique, mais m\u00eame si la requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras est rejet\u00e9e, l'instruction n'en sera pas moins publique.\n[11] Finalement, compte tenu du silence de la loi habilitante sur la question en l'esp\u00e8ce, je suis d'avis que je dois, pour trancher la requ\u00eate, exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal \u00e0 titre de ma\u00eetre dans sa propre maison ou ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure. (Voir Therrien (Re), 2001 CSC 35; Prassad c. Canada (M.E.I), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 560.)\n[12] Cela ne signifie pas que je peux exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'une fa\u00e7on anticonstitutionnelle ou d'une fa\u00e7on qui va \u00e0 l'encontre des objectifs de la LCDP. Plut\u00f4t, il s'agit simplement d'une manifestation du fait que l'examen de la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur les r\u00e9alit\u00e9s de ce dont le Tribunal a besoin afin de pouvoir correctement trancher la plainte et de ce qui pourrait nuire \u00e0 l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision.\nVII. ANALYSE Les facteurs qui militent en faveur de la requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras et la diffusion\n[13] En exer\u00e7ant mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour d\u00e9cider d'accueillir ou de rejeter la requ\u00eate, je note qu'un certain nombre de facteurs soulev\u00e9s par APTN et la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien appuieraient une ordonnance accordant l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras.\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la communaut\u00e9\n[14] Premi\u00e8rement, il est ind\u00e9niable que la justice est am\u00e9lior\u00e9e lorsque les personnes qui ont un int\u00e9r\u00eat direct envers une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire sont en mesure de bien la suivre et l'observer. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne soul\u00e8ve un grand int\u00e9r\u00eat direct pour un grand nombre de membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations, en particulier ceux qui ont re\u00e7u des services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille ou dont les parents ou les amis proches ont re\u00e7u de tels services. En ce qui a trait au fait que l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras aide les personnes directement affect\u00e9es \u00e0 suivre la proc\u00e9dure et facilite le partage des renseignements au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure, un tel acc\u00e8s serait b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la communaut\u00e9 envers l'administration de la justice.\nD\u00e9fis uniques du groupe vis\u00e9\n[15] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le facteur susmentionn\u00e9 a encore plus de poids lorsqu'on tient compte des caract\u00e9ristiques uniques des communaut\u00e9s vis\u00e9es par l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce. Le groupe desservi par les plaignants est dispers\u00e9 dans tout le pays et, dans une grande mesure, habite dans des r\u00e9gions du pays o\u00f9 le co\u00fbt d'un voyage \u00e0 Ottawa pour participer \u00e0 l'audience serait prohibitif au point de vue \u00e9conomique. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j'accepte l'observation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien au sujet des obstacles \u00e9conomiques importants auxquels de nombreux membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations font face, en particulier les enfants. De plus, la distribution du groupe vis\u00e9 dans tout le pays rend impossible pour le Tribunal de trouver une salle d'audience qui faciliterait ad\u00e9quatement l'acc\u00e8s physique pour toutes les personnes concern\u00e9es.\n[16] Enfin, l'importance des questions de principe de la pr\u00e9sente plainte d\u00e9finit le niveau et l'\u00e9tendue de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat que les membres du public partagent, y compris (sans s'y limiter) les membres des Premi\u00e8res Nations qui sont d'avis que l'affaire aura une grande r\u00e9percussion sur leur vie, ou sur les vies des personnes de leur entourage.\n[17] Cependant, ces facteurs doivent \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9s en fonction d'autres facteurs, en particulier ceux soulev\u00e9s par l'intim\u00e9.\nLes facteurs qui militent contre la requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras et la diffusion\nLes instances devant le TCDP : un processus juridictionnel\n[18] \u00c0 la lecture des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les parties, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien semble voir la pr\u00e9sente instance comme une commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9conciliation. Quant \u00e0 lui, APTN tente de tirer une analogie \u00e0 partir des pratiques en mati\u00e8re de m\u00e9dia des commissions d'enqu\u00eate. Cependant, ni l'une ni l'autre de ces commissions ne refl\u00e8te ad\u00e9quatement le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif qui r\u00e9git l'instance en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[19] En vertu de la LCDP, l'objectif principal du Tribunal est de trancher des plaintes et de d\u00e9cider lorsque la responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue par la loi devrait \u00eatre impos\u00e9e. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2003 CSC 36, [2003] 1 R.C.S. 884 :\n23 La principale fonction du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne est de nature juridictionnelle. Il tient des audiences formelles sur les plaintes dont il est saisi par la Commission. Il d\u00e9tient plusieurs des pouvoirs d'une cour de justice. Il est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 statuer sur des faits, \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter et \u00e0 appliquer le droit aux faits qui lui sont soumis et \u00e0 accorder les redressements appropri\u00e9s. De plus, ses audiences sont structur\u00e9es sensiblement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'un proc\u00e8s formel devant une cour de justice. Les parties en pr\u00e9sence devant le tribunal pr\u00e9sentent une preuve, font entendre et contre-interrogent des t\u00e9moins, et pr\u00e9sentent des observations sur l'application du droit aux faits. Le Tribunal ne participe pas \u00e0 l'\u00e9laboration des politiques et ne m\u00e8ne pas ses propres enqu\u00eates ind\u00e9pendantes sur les plaintes : le l\u00e9gislateur a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment attribu\u00e9 les fonctions d'enqu\u00eate et d'\u00e9laboration de politiques \u00e0 un organisme diff\u00e9rent, soit la Commission.\n[20] Je n'expliquerai pas en d\u00e9tail le mandat de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9conciliation du Canada, sauf pour dire qu'il est \u00e9vident, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la loi habilitante de cette commission, que son mandat est tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui du Tribunal d\u00e9crit par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Bell Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\n[21] En ce qui a trait aux affaires dont les commissions d'enqu\u00eate sont saisies, comme l'intim\u00e9 l'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans ses observations, le public joue un r\u00f4le crucial dans ce type de proc\u00e9dure. Les enqu\u00eates visent \u00e0 sensibiliser le public, \u00e0 aider la communaut\u00e9 \u00e0 gu\u00e9rir et \u00e0 restaurer la confiance du public envers les institutions. Il s'agit d'objectifs louables qui ont inconditionnellement une importance de tr\u00e8s grande valeur pour toute soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9mocratique r\u00e9gie par des lois.\n[22] Cependant, en \u00e9tablissant le TCDP, le l\u00e9gislateur a institu\u00e9 un ordre diff\u00e9rent de priorit\u00e9s. Le Tribunal a sa propre fonction distincte \u00e0 jouer dans le syst\u00e8me judiciaire, c'est-\u00e0-dire entendre des instances de nature contradictoire, d\u00e9terminer la responsabilit\u00e9 et - dans le cas d'une plainte fond\u00e9e - rendre des ordonnances. Dans ce contexte, bien que le public ne soit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement exclu, son r\u00f4le dans le processus du TCDP n'est simplement pas aussi essentiel qu'il l'est pour les commissions d'enqu\u00eate o\u00f9 l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement accord\u00e9.\n[23] APTN a invoqu\u00e9 en particulier la d\u00e9cision de la commission d'enqu\u00eate de la Saskatchewan dans Andreen c. Dairy Producer Co-operative Ltd. (No 2) (1994), 22 D.C.D.P. D\/80. M\u00eame si je tiens compte de la diff\u00e9rence de loi habilitante, ce qui \u00e0 mon avis a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans la d\u00e9cision Andreen, je ne souscris malheureusement pas \u00e0 l'approche du membre instructeur dans cette affaire qui, \u00e0 mon avis (du moins, dans le contexte de la LCDP), ne fait que combiner l'objet de la loi avec l'objectif de l'organisme juridictionnel qu'elle a cr\u00e9\u00e9. Je note aussi que l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 dans l'affaire Andreen \u00e9tait plus restreint que l'acc\u00e8s qu'APTN demande dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[24] Bien qu'il ne s'applique pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente question, l'article 52 de la LCDP illustre quand m\u00eame la nature et la fonction du Tribunal : les instances du Tribunal doivent \u00eatre publiques. Cependant, le droit du public d'observer ces instances est subordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs facteurs pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rants, en particulier l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l'instruction. Je me pencherai maintenant sur la question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9.\nL'\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties\n[25] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, le but principal de tout processus juridictionnel, apr\u00e8s l'audition de la preuve et des arguments, est de d\u00e9terminer si la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e peut soutenir les conclusions de fait qui entra\u00eenent la responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale. Tout cela doit se d\u00e9rouler dans des conditions qui respectent les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[26] La diffusion t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9e pose des d\u00e9fis uniques au processus juridictionnel. D'une part, elle offre la possibilit\u00e9 d'am\u00e9liorer la justesse des reportages, puisque les images brutes et le dialogue peuvent \u00eatre transmis directement au public avec un minimum d'interpr\u00e9tation de la part des journalistes. D'autre part, il faudrait \u00eatre na\u00eff pour croire qu'aucune licence journalistique n'est exerc\u00e9e au sujet du format dans lequel les s\u00e9quences t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9es sont diffus\u00e9es, en particulier dans le cadre de nouvelles t\u00e9l\u00e9vis\u00e9es. \u00c0 ce sujet, la simple capacit\u00e9 d'effectuer un montage des images de l'instance et d'en diffuser de tr\u00e8s courts extraits donne un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire immense au diffuseur et soul\u00e8ve la possibilit\u00e9 de la repr\u00e9sentation s\u00e9lective de la preuve, la repr\u00e9sentation incompl\u00e8te d'un t\u00e9moignage qui pourrait attaquer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin et la manipulation majeure de la s\u00e9quence, de la dur\u00e9e et du contexte des \u00e9v\u00e9nements film\u00e9s. Cependant, malgr\u00e9 tout cela, les repr\u00e9sentations gardent une apparence tr\u00e8s convaincante d'exactitude, parce qu'elles pr\u00e9sentent des images et des sons r\u00e9alistes des \u00e9v\u00e9nements.\n[27] Compte tenu de ces caract\u00e9ristiques et attributs uniques de la diffusion vid\u00e9o, je crois que d'accorder l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras \u00e0 l'audience risquerait de miner l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus du Tribunal et, de fa\u00e7on tout aussi importante, la confiance du public envers l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de ce processus.\n[28] J'ajoute que, bien qu'il ne soit pas clair si on demandera une ordonnance d'exclusion pour les t\u00e9moins dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, de telles ordonnances sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement demand\u00e9es et accord\u00e9es dans le cadre de proc\u00e9dures du TCDP. Il n'est pas difficile de s'imaginer les probl\u00e8mes qu'une telle ordonnance poseraient \u00e0 l'efficacit\u00e9 de l'audience si les t\u00e9moignages sont diffus\u00e9s au public de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re, alors que d'autres t\u00e9moins n'ont pas encore t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur les m\u00eames questions.\n[29] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l'audience pour toutes les parties serait grandement et irr\u00e9parablement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e si j'accordais l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras. Si l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l'instance est compromise, toute d\u00e9cision rendue serait invalide en droit.\nLe respect de la vie priv\u00e9e des participants\n[30] M\u00eame si l'on suppose qu'une grande partie des participants \u00e0 l'instance (p. ex. les t\u00e9moins des plaignants, les avocats des plaignants, les avocats de la CCDP) sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 tout droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e pour que les images qui sont film\u00e9es soient diffus\u00e9es dans tout le pays alors qu'ils participent \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure judiciaire, je ne crois pas qu'il soit juste de supposer que tous les participants \u00e0 l'audience sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 renoncer librement \u00e0 ce droit.\n[31] En plus de tous les droits l\u00e9gaux que les participants \u00e0 l'audience peuvent avoir et qui leur permettent de contr\u00f4ler l'utilisation de leur image et de toute image leur ressemblant, en tant qu'institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le TCDP est li\u00e9 par les dispositions de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. Certains des principes fondamentaux de cette loi pr\u00e9voient que les institutions f\u00e9d\u00e9rales : (i) ne recueilleront que les renseignements personnels qui ont un lien direct avec ses programmes ou ses activit\u00e9s et (ii) n'utiliseront les renseignements personnels qu'ils ont recueillis qu'aux fins auxquelles ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis ou pr\u00e9par\u00e9s (Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, L.R.C., 1985, ch. P-21, telle que modifi\u00e9e, article 4 et alin\u00e9a 7a)). Une fois de plus, bien que le consentement des personnes vis\u00e9es puisse att\u00e9nuer l'effet de ces principes, il convient de noter que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels est une loi quasi-constitutionnelle et qu'elle doit faire l'objet d'une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique. De plus, dans le contexte d'une proc\u00e9dure contentieuse, la possibilit\u00e9 d'obtenir le consentement libre et inform\u00e9 ou d'en v\u00e9rifier l'existence peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9e.\n[32] Finalement, les participants \u00e0 l'audience seront pr\u00e9sents dans la salle d'audience afin de participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure quasi-judiciaire. Ils se rendent disponibles pour le faire. Dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, le fait de permettre qu'ils soient film\u00e9s et que leurs d\u00e9clarations et leur image soient diffus\u00e9es dans tout le pays, devant d'innombrables t\u00e9l\u00e9spectateurs, en fait, dans un sens, des [traduction] acteurs captifs d'un drame m\u00e9diatique. Cela va \u00e0 l'encontre de ce qui devrait \u00eatre leur unique motivation pour participer \u00e0 l'audience et de ce qui devrait \u00eatre leur seule activit\u00e9: la participation \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire et l'ex\u00e9cution des r\u00f4les et des fonctions d\u00e9finies par la loi qui s'y rattachent.\n[33] En bref, je conclus que l'acc\u00e8s au t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras compromettra in\u00e9vitablement la vie priv\u00e9e des participants \u00e0 l'audience \u00e0 un niveau intol\u00e9rable et introduira un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de distraction qui sera grandement pr\u00e9judiciable au processus d'audience.\n[34] Avant de clore cette partie de l'analyse, je tiens \u00e0 formuler une observation suppl\u00e9mentaire. Bien que je ne fonde en aucun cas ma d\u00e9cision sur cet incident, je note que plus t\u00f4t ce mois-ci, un probl\u00e8me est survenu lorsqu'une des plaignantes, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, a publi\u00e9, sur Internet, la preuve obtenue lors du contre-interrogatoire pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'audience d'un souscripteur d'affidavit, contre-interrogatoire duquel le public avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu. Un tel incident sert \u00e0 rappeler que le Tribunal doit \u00eatre vigilant lorsqu'il d\u00e9termine les besoins juridictionnels de sa proc\u00e9dure quasi-judiciaire en ce qui a trait aux r\u00e9alit\u00e9s technologiques qui pr\u00e9valent dans les m\u00e9dias des communications. Cependant, je r\u00e9p\u00e8te que je ne me suis pas fond\u00e9e sur cet incident pour trancher la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate visant l'acc\u00e8s aux t\u00e9l\u00e9cam\u00e9ras.\nVIII. Conclusion : le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du d\u00e9cideur [35] Plus t\u00f4t dans mes motifs, j'ai not\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate n\u00e9cessite l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal \u00e0 titre de ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure, ou ma\u00eetre dans sa propre maison. Cependant, il existe au moins deux limites importantes \u00e0 ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire : l'existence de toute r\u00e8gle pr\u00e9vue par une loi et les principes de la justice naturelle.\n[36] Bien que des personnes raisonnables puissent ne pas s'entendre au sujet de l'application de certains des principes l\u00e9gaux d\u00e9crits dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il est important de noter que je suis la seule, \u00e0 titre de membre instructrice de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, qui soit responsable de l'int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du processus juridictionnel.

Avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience, l'agent du greffe a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties et leur a demand\u00e9 de remplir leur fiche de comparution. M. Gord Fischer, directeur national et repr\u00e9sentant du Syndicat des travailleurs et des travailleuses des postes \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de M. Myron May et de Mme Trish Masniuk. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne avait avis\u00e9 le Tribunal au pr\u00e9alable qu'elle ne participerait pas \u00e0 l'audience.\n[2] Le plaignant, Robert Ballantyne, n'a pas comparu et il n'a \u00e9galement pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ouverture de l'audience. Personne n'a comparu non plus en son nom.\n[3] Le Tribunal a suspendu l'audience jusqu'\u00e0 10 h 20 le jour m\u00eame. \u00c0 la reprise de l'audience, l'agent du greffe a la cause devant \u00eatre entendue et a de nouveau proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appel des parties. Le repr\u00e9sentant de l'intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent, mais le plaignant n'\u00e9tait toujours pas pr\u00e9sent et personne ne le repr\u00e9sentait.\n[4] Des documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal sous la cote T-1 confirmant que le plaignant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de l'audience, notamment les suivants :\nla lettre directives du Tribunal en date du 30 novembre 2009, avisant les parties de l'article 9 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne; le courriel en date du 30 novembre 2009 - Confirmation de la lettre des directives du Tribunal en date du 30 novembre 2009; la lettre directives du Tribunal en date du 28 janvier 2010, faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la lettre directives du Tribunal en date du 30 novembre 2009; le courriel en date du 28 janvier 2010 - Confirmation de la lettre directives du Tribunal en date du 28 janvier 2010; la lettre du Tribunal en date du 18 mai 2010, comprenant en annexe l'avis d'audience dat\u00e9 du18 mai 2010, confirmant la date d'audience du 1er juin 2010 \u00e0 Winnipeg (Manitoba); le courriel en date du 19 mai 2010 envoy\u00e9 le m\u00eame jour - Confirmation de la lettre du Tribunal du 18 mai 2010 et de l'avis d'audience en date du 18 mai 2010; L'imprim\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails du r\u00e9sultat personnel de Postes Canada pour l'article TM 132511961CA indiquait que l'article avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 pour livraison le 20 mai 2010 \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re adresse connue du plaignant, mais qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'exp\u00e9diteur.

L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable (qui ne soit pas un pr\u00e9texte) en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination?\nV. D\u00c9CISION\nI. la plainte [1] Le 21 mars 2007, le plaignant, M. William Shmuir, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte devant la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission ), all\u00e9guant qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l'intim\u00e9e, Carnival Cruise Lines (Carnival ), infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP ), l'intim\u00e9e ayant refus\u00e9 de l'engager du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience physique.\n[2] Dans sa plainte, M. Shmuir all\u00e8gue avoir particip\u00e9, le 11 octobre 2006, \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance de pr\u00e9sentation d'emploi et d'entrevues (le salon de l'emploi ) \u00e0 Toronto, en Ontario, \u00e0 laquelle il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 par Cast-a-Way, bureau de placement recrutant des employ\u00e9s pour le compte de Carnival, et avoir pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste de formateur au sein de Carnival. Il affirme avoir inform\u00e9 Carnival, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de Cast-a-Way, de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle avant de recevoir l'invitation et de se rendre au salon de l'emploi. Au salon de l'emploi, apr\u00e8s l'expos\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par Carnival, les participants ont d\u00fb r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un questionnaire \u00e0 choix multiple qui leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en m\u00eame temps qu'une feuille de r\u00e9ponses exigeant de noircir de petits cercles. Une fois noircis de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 s\u00e9lectionner la r\u00e9ponse choisie, ces petits cercles rendent possible la lecture automatique des r\u00e9ponses. M. Shmuir a fait savoir \u00e0 Carnival qu'il ne pourrait pas utiliser la feuille de r\u00e9ponses en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle et il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9crire ses r\u00e9ponses directement sur le questionnaire. Il soutient que Carnival lui a refus\u00e9 l'accommodement qu'il avait demand\u00e9 pour passer l'examen obligatoire, compte tenu de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle, qui consistait \u00e0 entourer la r\u00e9ponse de son choix sur le questionnaire. Il affirme qu'un repr\u00e9sentant de Carnival lui a dit que compte tenu de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle et des exigences du poste, il \u00e9tait vain de chercher \u00e0 obtenir le poste de formateur. M. Shmuir ajoute qu'on lui a alors demand\u00e9 de quitter le salon de l'emploi, lui refusant ainsi la chance d'obtenir l'emploi.\nII. LES CONCLUSIONS DE FAIT [3] M. Shmuir souffre de myopie avanc\u00e9e et de nystagmus cong\u00e9nital familial dans les deux yeux, ce qui fait en sorte que sa vision est significativement basse. La meilleure acuit\u00e9 visuelle corrig\u00e9e qu'il puisse obtenir est de 20\/200 dans ses deux yeux. Essentiellement, cela signifie que lorsqu'il porte des verres correcteurs de la myopie avanc\u00e9e, il peut voir \u00e0 20 pieds avec chacun de ses yeux ce qu'une personne ayant une vision 20\/20 (une vision normale) peut voir \u00e0 200 pieds. Il ne peut garder les yeux fix\u00e9s sur un point et ses yeux bougent involontairement. Sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle l'emp\u00eache d'obtenir un permis de conduire. Le Tribunal a toutefois not\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de se rendre \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins sans assistance, en marquant plusieurs pauses, et de lire lentement les documents qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, en les rapprochant de son visage.\n[4] M. Shmuir a 37 ans. Malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9ficience permanente qui l'affecte, il est ind\u00e9pendant depuis son jeune \u00e2ge. Il vit actuellement \u00e0 Hamilton et travaille b\u00e9n\u00e9volement pour une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 but non lucratif appel\u00e9e Community Functionality Facilitation Inc. D'apr\u00e8s M. Shmuir, cet organisme aide les personnes atteintes de d\u00e9ficience \u00e0 obtenir des services et des accommodements au sein de leur milieu. Sa seule source de revenus lui vient d'une subvention d'invalidit\u00e9 de l'Ontario, d'un montant compris entre 13 000 $ et 14 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, incluant une petite allocation alimentaire d'environ 200 $ par mois. En 2003, au terme d'un programme de trois ans, il a obtenu du Mohawk College un dipl\u00f4me de travailleur aupr\u00e8s des enfants et des jeunes. Outre son emploi actuel non r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de Community Functionality Facilitation Inc., il ne semble pas avoir occup\u00e9 d'emploi, si ce n'est au milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990, quand il a travaill\u00e9 pour un entrepreneur, effectuant de petits travaux de r\u00e9novation comme de la peinture. Il affirme aussi avoir acquis de l'exp\u00e9rience comme travailleur aupr\u00e8s d'enfants atteints de d\u00e9ficiences d\u00e9veloppementales et de jeunes contrevenants.\n[5] Cast-a-Way est une agence de recrutement \u00e0 laquelle Carnival et d'autres entreprises de croisi\u00e8res font appel pour les aider \u00e0 combler leurs besoins de recrutement. Cast-a-Way est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 distincte de Carnival. Elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance. En 2006 ou aux environs de cette ann\u00e9e, Cast-a-Way a publi\u00e9 des offres d'emploi pour diverses soci\u00e9t\u00e9s de croisi\u00e8res. En outre, au printemps et \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2006, dans le cadre de ses efforts de recrutement de formateurs \u00e0 titre de personnel de bord, Carnival a \u00e9galement publi\u00e9 des offres d'emploi dans des journaux de Toronto, invitant les gens \u00e0 poser leur candidature. L'emploi a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant un poste de [TRADUCTION] formateur de bord , c'est-\u00e0-dire que les t\u00e2ches aff\u00e9rentes au poste devaient \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es sur un des bateaux de croisi\u00e8re de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en haute mer. L'offre d'emploi pr\u00e9cisait \u00e9galement que le poste exigeait d'avoir l'exp\u00e9rience de la formation de groupe ainsi que d'excellentes aptitudes sur les plans de la pr\u00e9sentation, de la communication et de l'\u00e9locution.\n[6] En juillet 2006 ou aux environs de ce mois, M. Shmuir a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un curriculum vit\u00e6 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 Cast-a-Way. Le 6 juillet 2006, M. Eric Theriault a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception du curriculum vit\u00e6 de M. Shmuir par courriel. Dans son courriel, M. Theriault a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'automne 2006, Cast a Way serait \u00e0 la recherche de personnes qualifi\u00e9es d\u00e9sirant travailler comme conseillers aupr\u00e8s des jeunes pour les croisi\u00e8res Disney.\n[7] M. Shmuir a affirm\u00e9 avoir envoy\u00e9, en m\u00eame temps que son curriculum vit\u00e6, une lettre de pr\u00e9sentation par laquelle il informait Cast-a-Way de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle grave. Il a ajout\u00e9 que lui et son coll\u00e8gue et ami, M. Ben Bishop, avaient envoy\u00e9 cette lettre de pr\u00e9sentation en m\u00eame temps que le curriculum vit\u00e6 \u00e0 Cast-a-Way par courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 au moins deux reprises. M. Bishop a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en plus d'envoyer la lettre de pr\u00e9sentation par courriel, il l'avait \u00e9galement fait parvenir par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur \u00e0 Cast-a-Way le 4 juillet 2006, ou autour de cette date. La lettre de pr\u00e9sentation ne portait pas de date et ne pr\u00e9cisait pas qu'un curriculum vit\u00e6 \u00e9tait joint. Aucune preuve documentaire n'a montr\u00e9 que la lettre de pr\u00e9sentation avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courrier \u00e9lectronique ou par t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur; aucune preuve n'a montr\u00e9 non plus que Carnival ou Cast-a-Way avaient bien re\u00e7u cette lettre. Le relev\u00e9 de correspondance de Cast a Way faisait seulement \u00e9tat de la r\u00e9ception d'un curriculum vit\u00e6. Ce curriculum vit\u00e6 ne faisait mention d'aucune d\u00e9ficience. Les repr\u00e9sentants de Carnival et de Cast-a-Way qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience ont ni\u00e9 avoir jamais re\u00e7u la lettre de pr\u00e9sentation, ou avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Shmuir avant le 11 octobre 2006, quand le salon de l'emploi a eu lieu et que Carnival y cherchait un formateur.\n[8] \u00c0 la suite du courrier \u00e9lectronique envoy\u00e9 par M. Theriault, Cast-a-Way n'a pas donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'emploi de conseiller aupr\u00e8s des jeunes pour les croisi\u00e8res Disney, mais quelque temps avant le 2 octobre 2006, Mme Nicola Barton de Cast-a-Way a appel\u00e9 M. Shmuir pour discuter d'un poste de formateur aupr\u00e8s de Carnival.\n[9] M. Shmuir a affirm\u00e9 avoir mentionn\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle \u00e0 Mme Barton lors de cet appel. Mme Barton a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne lui a alors pas parl\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9ficience. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir demand\u00e9 des d\u00e9tails relatifs au parcours de M. Shmuir pour s'assurer qu'il pourrait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certaines exigences de base du poste, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concernait son exp\u00e9rience professionnelle. Elle soutient lui avoir expliqu\u00e9 les conditions qu'un candidat devait remplir avant de travailler sur un bateau, afin d'\u00e9tablir s'il serait capable de vivre et de travailler en mer. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir dit \u00e0 M. Shmuir, lors de leur conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, qu'une des exigences fondamentales d'un poste \u00e0 bord d'un bateau \u00e9tait de passer un examen m\u00e9dical complet et d'\u00eatre en bonne forme physique, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique m\u00e9dicale et aux politiques relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en mer de Carnival.\n[10] Pour sa part, M. Shmuir a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l'appel de Mme Barton environ un jour plus tard, en lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phonant dans l'intention expresse de reconfirmer qu'il \u00e9tait atteint de d\u00e9ficience visuelle, afin de s'assurer qu'elle en \u00e9tait clairement consciente. M. Shmuir a soutenu qu'elle lui a dit que sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle n'\u00e9tait pas une source de pr\u00e9occupation et que du moment o\u00f9 il pouvait se rendre sur le bateau, tout irait bien. Mme Barton a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n'avoir aucun souvenir d'une telle conversation.\n[11] Le 2 octobre 2006, Mme Barton a envoy\u00e9 un courrier \u00e9lectronique \u00e0 M. Shmuir, par lequel elle l'informait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi pour participer \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance de pr\u00e9sentation et d'entrevues relative \u00e0 des postes de formateur chez Carnival. Mme Barton pr\u00e9cisait que la s\u00e9ance aurait lieu le mercredi 11 octobre 2006, \u00e0 partir de 9 h 00, dans la salle Mount Pleasant du Grand Hotel, rue Jarvis, \u00e0 Toronto. Elle ajoutait que M. Shmuir devrait s'habiller de mani\u00e8re professionnelle et porter un complet, que la partie pr\u00e9sentation durerait une heure, mais qu'il devait s'attendre \u00e0 y passer la journ\u00e9e \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la partie pr\u00e9sentation serait suivie d'entrevues. Elle demandait \u00e9galement \u00e0 M. Shmuir d'apporter une copie de son passeport, un curriculum vit\u00e6 \u00e0 jour, une photographie et une attestation de v\u00e9rification de casier judiciaire.\n[12] Le 11 octobre 2006, M. Shmuir s'est lev\u00e9 t\u00f4t pour se rendre au Grand Hotel pour la pr\u00e9sentation et les entrevues donn\u00e9es aux fins de la dotation des postes de formateur en entreprise. C'est M. Bishop qui l'y a conduit.\n[13] M. Scott Nelson, repr\u00e9sentant de Carnival, et Mme Nicola Barton, de Cast-a-Way, \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents au salon de l'emploi qui s'est tenu le 11 octobre 2006.\n[14] M. Shmuir a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en entrant dans la salle Mount Pleasant avant le d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9ance, il s'\u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] inscrit , en informant Mme Barton de sa pr\u00e9sence et en lui parlant de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. Il \u00e9tait suivi par M. Bishop, qu'il a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant son [TRADUCTION] chauffeur \u00e0 la s\u00e9ance. Il s'est assis \u00e0 une table au fond de la salle, vu que les autres tables situ\u00e9es plus \u00e0 l'avant \u00e9taient occup\u00e9es par d'autres candidats arriv\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t. M. Bishop s'est assis pr\u00e8s de lui, sur un divan qui se trouvait \u00e0 sa droite, pr\u00e8s d'une porte conduisant \u00e0 un couloir ext\u00e9rieur. Mme Barton a soutenu que M. Shmuir ne lui a pas parl\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle avant le d\u00e9but de la s\u00e9ance.\n[15] J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Carnival selon lequel la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 ne disposait d'aucune information concernant la d\u00e9ficience visuelle de M. Shmuir avant le d\u00e9but du salon de l'emploi le 11 octobre 2006. Pour cela, je me fonde sur l'absence curieuse de tout document \u00e9tablissant que la lettre de pr\u00e9sentation avait bien \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e ou re\u00e7ue, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit, ainsi que sur mon appr\u00e9ciation des t\u00e9moignages de M. Nelson et de Mme Barton, qui se sont montr\u00e9s des t\u00e9moins plus cr\u00e9dibles que M. Shmuir par leur comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'audience et leurs souvenirs pr\u00e9cis des faits, sans compter l'impression qu'ils m'ont laiss\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la vraisemblance de leurs versions.\n[16] Le salon de l'emploi a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 9 h 00 le 11 octobre 2006. M. Scott Nelson, directeur de la formation \u00e0 bord de Carnival, \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 du d\u00e9roulement de la journ\u00e9e. M. Nelson a pr\u00e8s de 20 ans d'exp\u00e9rience dans son domaine et a lui-m\u00eame occup\u00e9 le poste de formateur \u00e0 bord d'un bateau. Environ 21 candidats avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s au salon de l'emploi. M. Nelson esp\u00e9rait engager un certain nombre de candidats pour des postes de formateur \u00e0 bord des 22 navires composant la flotte de bateaux de croisi\u00e8re de Carnival. Carnival travaille dans le monde entier et emploie environ 33 000 personnes. Son si\u00e8ge social se trouve \u00e0 Miami, en Floride. Ses bateaux varient en taille, pouvant accueillir de 3 000 \u00e0 4 000 passagers approximativement, avec des \u00e9quipages variant d'environ 900 \u00e0 plus de 1 000 membres. Tous ses employ\u00e9s travaillant \u00e0 bord de bateaux sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des marins et assument certaines responsabilit\u00e9s au chapitre des interventions en cas d'urgences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[17] Le programme du salon de l'emploi comprenait une s\u00e9ance d'information de groupe pendant les deux premi\u00e8res heures de la matin\u00e9e, incluant des vid\u00e9os ainsi que des s\u00e9ances de questions et r\u00e9ponses, suivie d'un test servant \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les comp\u00e9tences de base d'une dur\u00e9e de 20 minutes. Apr\u00e8s une pause d'une heure pour le repas, l'apr\u00e8s-midi a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 aux entrevues de tous les candidats invit\u00e9s, qui incluaient un expos\u00e9 de 2 minutes donn\u00e9 par chacun des candidats sur le sujet de leur choix.\n[18] Les sujets abord\u00e9s dans la s\u00e9ance d'information de groupe \u00e9taient les suivants : premi\u00e8rement, des informations au sujet des bateaux de croisi\u00e8re de Carnival, y compris l'histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, sa flotte, son personnel, ses ports d'escale, son style de client\u00e8le et de croisi\u00e8res ainsi que sa vision d'entreprise. Deuxi\u00e8mement, des informations au sujet de la vie et du travail \u00e0 bord d'un bateau, y compris au sujet des cabines et du partage d'une cabine avec une autre personne, de la nourriture, de la diversit\u00e9 culturelle, des cong\u00e9s et des heures de travail approximatives, de la dur\u00e9e approximative des contrats, du temps libre et des activit\u00e9s organis\u00e9es de l'\u00e9quipage, des avantages sociaux, de la perception du r\u00f4le de formateur \u00e0 bord et des attentes en mati\u00e8re d'accueil. Troisi\u00e8mement, des informations au sujet des responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 bord, y compris l'importance de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 comme principale priorit\u00e9, de la responsabilit\u00e9 de tous les membres d'\u00e9quipage quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 bord, de la responsabilit\u00e9 du formateur quant \u00e0 la conduite de diverses activit\u00e9s de formation relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, comme la ma\u00eetrise des foules, la gestion de crises, le leadership et la familiarisation avec le bateau, et du r\u00f4le actif que les formateurs \u00e9taient cens\u00e9s jouer au sein des comit\u00e9s de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et dans les initiatives relatives \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 bord des bateaux ainsi qu'en mati\u00e8re d'exercices et de formation portant sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Quatri\u00e8mement, des informations au sujet des fonctions du poste de formateur.\n[19] Lors de la s\u00e9ance d'information, M. Nelson a d\u00e9fini les t\u00e2ches et responsabilit\u00e9s qui attendaient les formateurs que Carnival engagerait ainsi que les exigences relatives \u00e0 ces postes. Parmi les t\u00e2ches abord\u00e9es : pr\u00e9senter une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de programmes de formation et de ressources \u00e9ducatives; repr\u00e9senter le d\u00e9partement de la formation de fa\u00e7on professionnelle et positive; communiquer efficacement avec les pairs, le gestionnaire de la formation et du perfectionnement, le gestionnaire de la formation et du perfectionnement des cadres, le directeur de la formation \u00e0 bord des bateaux et toute l'\u00e9quipe de gestion \u00e0 bord; faciliter la mise en uvre de tous les programmes de formation \u00e0 bord et tenir un journal exact de ces activit\u00e9s; g\u00e9rer les activit\u00e9s quotidiennes du centre de formation de l'\u00e9quipage; assister et participer activement aux rencontres bimestrielles sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9; administrer le centre de formation de l'\u00e9quipage; produire des rapports exacts en temps opportun et adh\u00e9rer \u00e0 un ensemble de normes relatives \u00e0 la tenue des dossiers et aux autres t\u00e2ches de formation; assister \u00e0 tous les s\u00e9minaires et programmes de formation conform\u00e9ment aux instructions de la Direction de la formation et prendre part aux activit\u00e9s de secours en situations d'urgence, y compris l'extinction des incendies et l'\u00e9vacuation du bateau.\n[20] Le titulaire du poste de formateur est pay\u00e9 1 800 $US par mois. Il s'agit d'un emploi temporaire d'une dur\u00e9e de six mois, \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter dans les dix mois. Apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode de six mois, les membres d'\u00e9quipage doivent prendre un cong\u00e9 de deux mois sans traitement avant de commencer un nouveau contrat de six mois, s'ils sont r\u00e9engag\u00e9s. Sur la p\u00e9riode de dix mois, ces deux mois additionnels permettent de planifier le contrat de six mois avec plus de flexibilit\u00e9.\n[21] Pendant la s\u00e9ance d'information, M. Nelson s'est efforc\u00e9 de d\u00e9peindre \u00e0 ses auditeurs, de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9aliste, les d\u00e9fis de la vie \u00e0 bord d'un bateau, loin de la famille et des amis pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes de temps. M. Nelson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plupart des formateurs ne restaient pas avec Carnival au-del\u00e0 de la dur\u00e9e du contrat de six mois en raison des rigueurs et des conditions de l'emploi. Il a demand\u00e9 aux candidats pr\u00e9sents de s'assurer qu'ils comprenaient l'ensemble de ces d\u00e9fis, ajoutant qu'il leur reviendrait, s'ils \u00e9taient s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s, de d\u00e9cider s'ils souhaitaient adopter ce genre de vie. Il a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la principale priorit\u00e9 de tous les membres d'\u00e9quipage \u00e9tait de savoir r\u00e9agir en cas de situation urgente, en vue de prot\u00e9ger la vie des passagers, des autres membres d'\u00e9quipage ainsi que la leur. S'ils \u00e9taient s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s sur la base de leur exp\u00e9rience pertinente, de leurs qualifications et de leur aptitude \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter un expos\u00e9 lors de la s\u00e9ance, ils devraient passer un examen m\u00e9dical confirmant qu'ils r\u00e9pondent aux normes concernant les marins, \u00e0 celles \u00e9tablies par Carnival et par les conventions internationales en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ainsi qu'aux r\u00e8glements concernant la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re.\n[22] Dans les informations fournies par Carnival, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il serait bon que les candidats au poste de formateur aient suivi une formation pertinente, qu'ils aient l'exp\u00e9rience de la formation de groupe, une excellente pr\u00e9sentation, des aptitudes \u00e0 la communication et \u00e0 la prise de parole en public et une personnalit\u00e9 extravertie, qui les pr\u00e9dispose au service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s la partie pr\u00e9sentation, un test de comp\u00e9tences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de 20 minutes \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l'horaire. Les t\u00e9moignages de M. Shmuir et de M. Nelson relatifs \u00e0 ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 pendant cette \u00e9tape du salon de l'emploi le 11 octobre 2006 divergent.\n[24] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Shmuir relatif aux faits est le suivant. Un expos\u00e9 relatif au test de comp\u00e9tences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales a commenc\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le repas le 11 octobre 2006. Quand M. Nelson a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9crire le test, \u00e9voquant la feuille de r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 choix multiples comportant les petits cercles, M. Shmuir a lev\u00e9 la main pour pr\u00e9venir M. Nelson qu'il ne serait pas en mesure d'utiliser une telle feuille pour y inscrire ses r\u00e9ponses du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle, les cercles \u00e9tant trop petits pour qu'il puisse les voir. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Nelson qu'on l'autorise \u00e0 \u00e9crire ses r\u00e9ponses ou \u00e0 entourer les r\u00e9ponses aux questions \u00e0 choix multiples sur le questionnaire. Dans un premier temps, M. Nelson lui a dit qu'il r\u00e9pondrait plus tard \u00e0 sa demande, continuant d'expliquer les modalit\u00e9s du test aux autres candidats pr\u00e9sents. M. Nelson a ensuite entrepris de distribuer le test et les feuilles de r\u00e9ponses. \u00c0 ce stade, M. Shmuir a de nouveau lev\u00e9 la main, rappelant \u00e0 M. Nelson que le test lui posait un probl\u00e8me. M. Nelson est alors revenu au fond de la salle, \u00e0 la table \u00e0 laquelle M. Shmuir \u00e9tait assis, et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter du probl\u00e8me avec lui. M. Shmuir a dit \u00e0 M. Nelson qu'il avait besoin d'un accommodement pour passer le test du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. M. Nelson s'est alors adress\u00e9 \u00e0 un [TRADUCTION] Afro Am\u00e9ricain non identifi\u00e9 qui se trouvait dans la salle, ajoutant [TRADUCTION] Je m'en occupe. M. Nelson est ensuite all\u00e9 parler \u00e0 Mme Barton et ils sont tous les deux retourn\u00e9s parler \u00e0 M. Shmuir, lui demandant de les suivre \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la salle Mount Pleasant, dans le couloir adjacent. M. Bishop \u00e9tait assis sur le divan situ\u00e9 dans le fond de la salle, \u00e0 la droite de M. Shmuir, pendant tout ce temps. M. Shmuir a suivi Mme Barton et M. Nelson \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la salle, dans le couloir, pr\u00e8s de la porte d'entr\u00e9e rest\u00e9e ouverte. M. Bishop s'est \u00e9galement rapproch\u00e9 de l'endroit o\u00f9 M. Shmuir, Mme Barton et M. Nelson se tenaient. M. Nelson a dit \u00e0 M. Shmuir que vu la r\u00e9glementation relative aux bateaux de croisi\u00e8re en mer, les inspections de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re et les divers probl\u00e8mes auxquels il aurait \u00e0 faire face \u00e0 bord, y compris son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 bien distinguer les diff\u00e9rents panneaux de signalisation, il ne pourrait pas se qualifier pour le poste de formateur, du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. M. Nelson a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Shmuir de s'en aller. M. Shmuir a dit \u00e0 M. Nelson que dans 90 % des cas lorsqu'il postulait un emploi, on rejetait sa candidature en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. Apr\u00e8s que M. Nelson lui a dit de s'en aller, MM. Shmuir et Bishop sont retourn\u00e9s dans la salle pour prendre leurs manteaux avant de partir. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis par deux hommes en costume sombre qui ont sembl\u00e9 les escorter de pr\u00e8s jusque dans la rue. M. Shmuir a per\u00e7u la demande qu'on lui avait faite de partir et la fa\u00e7on dont on l'a ensuite accompagn\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de l'h\u00f4tel comme d\u00e9gradantes. Il s'est senti d\u00e9valu\u00e9. Il n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Nelson si M. Bishop pouvait venir avec lui sur le bateau de croisi\u00e8re afin de l'aider \u00e0 s'acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches.\n[25] Le r\u00e9cit des faits survenus le 11 octobre 2006 relat\u00e9 par M. Nelson \u00e9tait le suivant. La pr\u00e9sentation du test de comp\u00e9tences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales a eu lieu avant le repas de midi. Tandis que M. Nelson d\u00e9crivait le test et ses modalit\u00e9s aux candidats pr\u00e9sents, M. Shmuir a lev\u00e9 la main. M. Shmuir n'a pas \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 parl\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9ficience ou de quelque difficult\u00e9 qu'il pourrait avoir \u00e0 passer le test et M. Nelson lui a dit qu'il s'occuperait de lui apr\u00e8s avoir distribu\u00e9 le test. Apr\u00e8s avoir distribu\u00e9 le test, M. Nelson s'est rendu au fond de la salle, \u00e0 la table \u00e0 laquelle M. Shmuir \u00e9tait assis pour parler avec lui. M. Bishop \u00e9tait assis \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de M. Shmuir \u00e0 la table. M. Nelson s'est fait une place entre M. Shmuir et M. Bishop afin de demander \u00e0 M. Shmuir de quoi il voulait lui parler et c'est alors que M. Shmuir lui a dit qu'il ne pourrait pas passer le test en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle. M. Nelson est ensuite all\u00e9 voir Mme Barton pour lui demander si elle \u00e9tait au courant de la situation de M. Shmuir. Mme Barton lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne savait rien au sujet de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Shmuir. M. Nelson est alors retourn\u00e9 parler \u00e0 M. Shmuir, lui demandant de les suivre dans le couloir lui et Mme Barton afin de discuter de la situation. M. Nelson a pens\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 d'aller dans le couloir avec M. Shmuir afin d'\u00e9viter de d\u00e9ranger les autres candidats, qui avaient alors commenc\u00e9 l'examen, mais aussi afin d'\u00e9viter de mettre M. Shmuir dans une situation embarrassante. Il n'y avait pas d'hommes en costume sombre charg\u00e9s d'assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou quoi que ce soit d'autre, et il n'y avait pas non plus d'homme pr\u00e9sent dans la salle qui aurait pu \u00eatre d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] Afro Am\u00e9ricain . Les seules personnes pr\u00e9sentes dans la salle Mount Pleasant \u00e9taient les autres candidats, M. Shmuir, M. Bishop, Mme Barton et M. Nelson. M. Nelson, Mme Barton, M. Shmuir et M. Bishop sont tous sortis de la salle, dans le couloir, et ils ont ferm\u00e9 la porte derri\u00e8re eux. M. Nelson a discut\u00e9 avec M. Shmuir dans le couloir, essayant de lui pr\u00e9senter certains des d\u00e9fis auxquels il ferait face en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle s'il devait assumer le poste de formateur \u00e0 bord d'un bateau de croisi\u00e8re en mer. M. Nelson a mentionn\u00e9 les inspections de la Garde c\u00f4ti\u00e8re, la r\u00e9glementation et les exigences ainsi que la signalisation. Il a dit \u00e0 M. Shmuir que la d\u00e9cision de continuer le processus conduisant \u00e0 l'obtention du poste lui appartenait. Il ne lui a pas demand\u00e9 de s'en aller, pas plus qu'il n'a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 le dissuader de continuer \u00e0 prendre part au processus et, en fait, il lui a express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 s'il souhaitait continuer. M. Shmuir n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Nelson de lui offrir un accommodement pour passer le test. M. Shmuir a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Nelson si M. Bishop pourrait l'accompagner \u00e0 bord du bateau afin de l'assister et M. Nelson lui a r\u00e9pondu que ce ne serait pas possible. M. Shmuir a fait savoir \u00e0 M. Nelson qu'il ne souhaitait pas aller de l'avant avec le processus d'embauche et qu'il souhaitait s'en aller. M. Shmuir a remerci\u00e9 M. Nelson pour les informations re\u00e7ues. MM. Shmuir et Bishop sont retourn\u00e9s dans la salle r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer leurs manteaux et sont partis sans que personne les suive.\n[26] J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Nelson, selon lequel il n'a pas dissuad\u00e9 M. Shmuir de continuer \u00e0 prendre part au salon de l'emploi et selon lequel il n'a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Shmuir de s'en aller. M. Nelson s'est montr\u00e9 un excellent t\u00e9moin, s'exprimant tr\u00e8s clairement. Il a beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience professionnelle. M. Shmuir semblait avoir des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 se rem\u00e9morer les faits. Par exemple, apr\u00e8s avoir dit qu'il avait postul\u00e9 un certain nombre d'emplois, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de pr\u00e9ciser les emplois en question, \u00e0 une exception pr\u00e8s. Son r\u00e9cit au sujet des deux hommes en costume sombre et de l'Afro-Am\u00e9ricain non identifi\u00e9 me semble douteuse. Ni M. Nelson ni Mme Barton n'ont confirm\u00e9 que ces individus \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents et il est difficile d'imaginer que de telles personnes eussent \u00e9t\u00e9 engag\u00e9es pour s'occuper de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou de t\u00e2ches semblables lors d'un salon de l'emploi visant \u00e0 embaucher des formateurs. Je pense que M. Nelson s'est efforc\u00e9 d'informer correctement M. Shmuir des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles il pourrait faire face \u00e0 bord d'un bateau de croisi\u00e8re en tant que formateur atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience visuelle. Je crois que si M. Shmuir lui avait demand\u00e9 un accommodement pour passer le test, il le lui aurait accord\u00e9. Si M. Nelson avait vraiment voulu faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de M. Shmuir en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, il aurait facilement pu faire en sorte que M. Shmuir continue de participer au salon de l'emploi, se servant ensuite de l'examen m\u00e9dical ou de l'\u00e9valuation de ses comp\u00e9tences et exp\u00e9riences aux fins de l'emploi pour rejeter sa candidature. Je crois que la d\u00e9cision de M. Shmuir de quitter le salon de l'emploi \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement volontaire et qu'\u00e0 ce stade, il a de lui-m\u00eame abandonn\u00e9 le processus. Mme Barton, qui a elle aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible, a corrobor\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit que M. Nelson a livr\u00e9 des faits survenus au salon de l'emploi.\nIII. LE DROIT A. L'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination\n[27] L'article 7 de la LCDP est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait,\npar des moyens directs ou indirects :\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\nLa d\u00e9ficience est un motif de distinction illicite aux termes de l'article 3 de la LCDP.\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve a \u00e9tabli que le plaignant avait une faible acuit\u00e9 visuelle et qu'il \u00e9tait aveugle au sens de la loi.\n[28] Il appartient au plaignant d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Une preuve prima facie est une preuve qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es, et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier une d\u00e9cision favorable au plaignant, en l'absence d'une r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne doit pas \u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration lorsqu'on cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si le plaignant a apport\u00e9 une preuve prima facie de discrimination (voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, et Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204).\nB. Le renversement du fardeau de la preuve et la justification [29] Une fois qu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il incombe \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer, au moyen d'une explication raisonnable (qui ne soit pas un pr\u00e9texte), soit que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9, la pr\u00e9tendue discrimination n'est pas survenue, soit que sa conduite \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9e. Pour que le bien fond\u00e9 de la plainte soit prouv\u00e9, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que le motif discriminatoire soit la seule base des actions ou des d\u00e9cisions de l'employeur. Il suffit que la discrimination soit seulement l'un des facteurs de la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur (Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, aux paragraphes 4 et 5; LCDP, article 15). Voir aussi Canada c. Lambie, 1996 CanLII 3940 (C.F.).\nIV. ANALYSE A. L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant en commettant l'infraction pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP, c'est-\u00e0-dire en lui refusant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des chances \u00e9gales d'emploi du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience physique? [30] Sur la foi de la preuve du plaignant, sans prendre en consid\u00e9ration la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e, je conclus que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une d\u00e9ficience par la LCDP. M. Shmuir a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa candidature a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce que l'intim\u00e9e ne lui a pas permis d'aller plus avant dans le processus, du fait de sa d\u00e9ficience visuelle.\nB. L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable (qui ne soit pas un pr\u00e9texte) en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve prima facie de discrimination? [31] La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e relative \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation du plaignant concernant les faits r\u00e9ellement survenus dans la salle Mount Pleasant apr\u00e8s la distribution du test de comp\u00e9tences et relative \u00e0 la discussion qui a ensuite eu lieu dans le couloir m'a convaincu que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait, en aucune mani\u00e8re, rejet\u00e9 la candidature du plaignant. Je conclus plut\u00f4t que c'est le plaignant lui m\u00eame qui a retir\u00e9 sa candidature, volontairement, quand il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de s'en aller. Ainsi, en l'esp\u00e8ce, aucun emploi n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant a volontairement retir\u00e9 sa candidature, si candidature il y a eu, avant que l'intim\u00e9e puisse rendre une d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 son embauche.\nV. D\u00c9CISION [32] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la plainte au motif qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Lustig\n[1] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate porte sur une requ\u00eate des plaignants pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2009 visant la finalisation, par le Tribunal, de la liste des plaignants et l'\u00e9tablissement de l'importance des d\u00e9pens des plaignants en lien avec le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\n[2] Les plaignants sont un groupe d'infirmiers et d'infirmi\u00e8res majoritairement compos\u00e9 de femmes qui travaillent \u00e0 titre d'\u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux avec des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux pour le programme de prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (RPC). Ils d\u00e9terminent l'admissibilit\u00e9 aux prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 du RPC. Les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux sont un groupe de m\u00e9decins majoritairement compos\u00e9 d'hommes.\n[3] Les plaignants soutiennent que depuis que la premi\u00e8re infirmi\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en 1972, ils accomplissent un travail identique \u00e0 celui des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux, et qu'en d\u00e9pit de cela, ils ont re\u00e7u un traitement tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rent de celui des conseillers sur les plans de la reconnaissance professionnelle, de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, du paiement de leurs droits de permis ainsi que de la formation et des possibilit\u00e9s de d\u00e9veloppement professionnel.\n[4] La plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2004 et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) l'a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2005, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[5] Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007 (la d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9), 2007 TCDP 56, modifi\u00e9e le 28 mai 2009, le Tribunal a conclu que m\u00eame s'il y avait un chevauchement marqu\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es par les \u00e9valuateurs et les conseillers, il existait aussi des diff\u00e9rences qui justifiaient, en partie, que les deux groupes d'employ\u00e9s soient trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment. Le Tribunal a notamment conclu que les intim\u00e9s n'avaient pas justifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on raisonnable et non discriminatoire la raison pour laquelle les conseillers \u00e9taient reconnus comme \u00e9tant des professionnels de la sant\u00e9 et r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence quand leur fonction principale consistait \u00e0 trancher des questions d'admissibilit\u00e9, et que, alors que les \u00e9valuateurs effectuaient les m\u00eames t\u00e2ches, ils \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant des administrateurs de programme et r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence.\n[6] Parvenant \u00e0 la conclusion que les plaintes \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es, le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate des parties, qui lui demandaient d'ordonner qu'il soit mis fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, se gardant de pr\u00e9ciser quelles \u00e9taient les mesures de redressement \u00e0 adopter. \u00c0 leur demande, les parties ont eu l'occasion de n\u00e9gocier avec tous les intervenants les mesures qu'il convenait de prendre, le Tribunal demeurant saisi de cet aspect de la d\u00e9cision si les parties ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 une entente. Il s'agit du seul aspect de la d\u00e9cision au sujet duquel le Tribunal est demeur\u00e9 saisi.\n[7] Les parties se sont vu accorder un d\u00e9lai de trois mois pour n\u00e9gocier une entente sur les questions relatives aux r\u00e9parations qui restaient en suspens. Toutefois, elles n'ont pu parvenir \u00e0 une telle entente.\n[8] Par cons\u00e9quent, il a fallu convoquer une audience pour trancher les questions en litige suivantes :\nLa bonne fa\u00e7on de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire; L'indemnisation pour la perte de salaire subie le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant; L'indemnisation pour le pr\u00e9judice moral subi par les plaignants en cons\u00e9quence de l'acte discriminatoire; Toute autre question en suspens relative aux r\u00e9parations.\n[9] La majorit\u00e9 des plaignants \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par l'avocat Lawrence Armstrong \u00e0 l'audience. Les plaignants qui n'\u00e9taient pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par M. Armstrong n'ont comparu, en personne ou repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat, ni \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'examen de la responsabilit\u00e9 ni \u00e0 celle de la d\u00e9termination des r\u00e9parations, et ce, en d\u00e9pit du fait qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9s de la tenue de ces audiences.\n[10] Une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire au sujet de la d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale le 14 janvier 2009 (voir le dossier de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale T-55-08). La Cour a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire le 4 mai 2010. (Voir Canada (P.G.) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490, appel en instance, dossier de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale A-219-10.)\n[11] Dans la d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 25 mai 2009 (la d\u00e9cision sur les r\u00e9parations), 2009 TCDP 16, le Tribunal a conclu que :\nLa bonne fa\u00e7on de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire consistait \u00e0 mettre en place un nouveau sous-groupe au sein de Sciences infirmi\u00e8res \u00e0 l'intention des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et que la mise en place d'un tel sous-groupe devait commencer dans les 60 jours suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision; Il n'y aurait aucune indemnisation pour perte de salaire; L'indemnisation payable par les intim\u00e9s pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que les plaignants ont subi en cons\u00e9quence de l'acte discriminatoire serait de 6 000 $ chacun pour deux des plaignants seulement, avec int\u00e9r\u00eats; Les intim\u00e9s devraient payer \u00e0 M. Armstrong les frais juridiques raisonnablement engag\u00e9s, plus int\u00e9r\u00eat, pour ses services lorsqu'il a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 des plaignants au cours des discussions entre les parties pour \u00e9tablir l'importance des d\u00e9pens, et le Tribunal resterait saisi de cet aspect de l'affaire au cas o\u00f9 les parties ne parviendraient pas \u00e0 une entente.\n[12] Des demandes de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de r\u00e9paration du Tribunal ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es le 24 juin 2009 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir les dossiers de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale T-106-09,T-1024-09 et T-1025-09). La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'a pas tranch\u00e9 les demandes et l'affaire fait maintenant l'objet d'une instance \u00e0 gestion sp\u00e9ciale devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[13] D'apr\u00e8s leurs observations, les parties ne s'entendent pas au sujet du nombre de personnes inscrites sur la liste des plaignants et de leur identit\u00e9 .\n[14] Les intim\u00e9s sont d'avis que les 413 personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 1 \u00e0 413, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, devraient se trouver sur la liste des plaignants. Cette opinion est fond\u00e9e sur le point de vue des intim\u00e9s selon lequel ces personnes \u00e9taient les seules au sujet desquelles le Tribunal a pris sa d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est functus officio de la demande des plaignants initiaux d'ajouter des noms \u00e0 la liste des plaignants.\n[15] La Commission est d'avis que les 416 personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 1 \u00e0 416, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, devraient se trouver sur la liste des plaignants. La Commission est du m\u00eame avis que les intim\u00e9s, sauf qu'elle soutient que les personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 414 \u00e0 416, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, devraient aussi se trouver sur la liste des plaignants parce qu'ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal, mais par inadvertance, leurs noms n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s aux parties, ce qui justifie donc une exception au principe de functus officio.\n[16] Les plaignants sont d'avis que les 427 personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 1 \u00e0 427, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, devraient se trouver sur la liste des plaignants. Les plaignants sont du m\u00eame point de vue que la Commission au sujet des personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 414 \u00e0 416, inclusivement. De plus, les plaignants soutiennent que la personne inscrite au num\u00e9ro 417, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, devrait \u00eatre inscrite sur la liste des plaignants parce que sa plainte a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission au Tribunal, mais que, par inadvertance, elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9e aux parties. De plus, les plaignants sont d'avis que les personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 418 \u00e0 427, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, devraient se trouver sur la liste des plaignants parce que leurs noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis et qu'elles ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, mais que pour une raison quelconque, leurs noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s ou ont disparu de la liste. Les plaignants soutiennent que ces personnes devraient se trouver sur la liste des plaignants, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'il n'existe aucune preuve qu'elles ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission, ou qu'une plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en leur nom, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, et malgr\u00e9 le fait que leurs noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois pendant l'audience portant sur les r\u00e9parations, apr\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 eut \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. De plus, les plaignants font valoir que les noms devraient faire partie de la liste, m\u00eame si les intim\u00e9s et le Tribunal n'ont jamais accept\u00e9 que ces personnes faisaient partie des plaignants.\n[17] M. Armstrong, au nom des plaignants, a essentiellement demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rouvrir sa d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 afin d'ajouter de nouvelles parties. En vertu du principe de droit de functus officio ( s'\u00e9tant acquitt\u00e9 de sa charge ), en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux ne peuvent revenir sur une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive, sauf lorsqu'il y a eu un lapsus lors de sa r\u00e9daction, ou lorsqu'il y a eu une erreur dans l'expression de l'intention manifeste du tribunal (Chandler c. Alberta Association of Architects, 1989 CanLII 41 (C.S.C), [1989] 2 R.C.S. 848) Dans l'arr\u00eat Chandler, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le principe de functus officio s'appliquait \u00e9galement aux tribunaux administratifs, encore que son application puisse y \u00eatre plus souple. Ainsi, il est possible qu'un tribunal revienne sur une d\u00e9cision si sa loi habilitante porte \u00e0 croire que cela lui permettra d'exercer les fonctions que ladite loi lui conf\u00e8re. En outre, le tribunal peut, pour [compl\u00e9ter] la t\u00e2che que lui confie la loi, rouvrir sa d\u00e9cision s'il a omis de trancher une question qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit dans la proc\u00e9dure et qu'il a le pouvoir de trancher en vertu de sa loi habilitante.\n[18] Dans la d\u00e9cision Grover c. Canada (Conseil national de recherche), [1994] A.C.F. n\u00b0 1000 (QL), la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que la LCDP ne contienne aucune disposition autorisant express\u00e9ment le TCDP a r\u00e9examiner ses d\u00e9cisions, le fait que la LCDP investisse le TCDP de larges pouvoirs, ajout\u00e9 au fait que la LCDP devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re large de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 donner pleinement effet aux droits qu'elle prot\u00e8ge, permet au TCDP de r\u00e9server sa comp\u00e9tence sur certains points afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que les plaignants jouissent effectivement de la r\u00e9paration qu'il leur a accord\u00e9e. Dans la d\u00e9cision Grover, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le TCDP avait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 express\u00e9ment sa comp\u00e9tence sur toute question relative \u00e0 la mise en application d'une des mesures de r\u00e9paration qu'il avait ordonn\u00e9es en statuant sur la plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, le TCDP avait la comp\u00e9tence de rouvrir sa d\u00e9cision et d'entendre de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[19] De m\u00eame, dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Moore, 1998 CanLII 9085 (C.F.), [1998] 4 C.F. 585, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a remarqu\u00e9 que, dans le cadre de cette affaire, le TCDP avait \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 explicitement, en rendant son ordonnance de r\u00e9paration, qu'il conserverait sa comp\u00e9tence au cas o\u00f9 les parties n'arriveraient pas \u00e0 mettre au point les d\u00e9tails aff\u00e9rents aux r\u00e9parations. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a par cons\u00e9quent conclu que le TCDP avait le pouvoir de rouvrir son ordonnance ant\u00e9rieure et de la r\u00e9examiner.\n[20] En accord avec ce raisonnement, dans la d\u00e9cision Goyette c. Syndicat des Employ\u00e9s Terminus Voyageur Colonial, 2001 CanLII 8495 (T.C.D.P.), le TCDP a reconnu que le principe de functus officio l'emp\u00eachait de rouvrir une instruction quant \u00e0 une question \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de laquelle il n'avait pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence.\n[21] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal n'avait pas r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence pour entendre d'autres questions que celles relatives aux r\u00e9parations dans sa d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait clairement d\u00e9finitive, m\u00eame si elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e pour r\u00e9gler une erreur math\u00e9matique.\n[22] Les exceptions au principe de functus officio articul\u00e9es dans l'arr\u00eat Chandler devraient cependant \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es aux personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 414 \u00e0 417, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, parce que je suis d'avis que leur exclusion de la liste pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les intim\u00e9s \u00e9tait soit un lapsus lors de la r\u00e9daction de la d\u00e9cision, soit une erreur dans l'expression de l'intention manifeste du Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9. Je ne peux pas conclure que les personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 418 \u00e0 427, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, ont droit \u00e0 la m\u00eame exception pour les motifs \u00e9tablis au paragraphe 16 des pr\u00e9sentes, c'est \u00e0 dire qu'il n'y a aucune preuve qu'une plainte en leur nom a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission et renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal et que leurs noms n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois que lors de l'audience sur les r\u00e9parations, apr\u00e8s que la d\u00e9cision sur la responsabilit\u00e9 eut \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, surtout que les intim\u00e9s et le Tribunal n'ont jamais accept\u00e9 que ces noms faisaient partie de la liste des plaignants.\n[23] Pour ces motifs, le Tribunal conclue que les personnes inscrites sous les num\u00e9ros 1 \u00e0 417, inclusivement, \u00e0 l'annexe A des pr\u00e9sentes, sont les personnes qui doivent se trouver sur la liste des plaignants.\n[24] Comme je l'ai not\u00e9 au paragraphe 11(4), dans sa d\u00e9cision sur les r\u00e9parations, le Tribunal a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence au sujet de la question de l'importance des frais juridiques raisonnablement engag\u00e9s pour l'avocat. Les parties ne se sont pas entendues et ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[25] Apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal eut rendu sa d\u00e9cision sur les r\u00e9parations, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le 26 octobre 2009, a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Mowat, o\u00f9 elle a conclu que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des frais juridiques. Une demande d'autorisation d'appel de la d\u00e9cision Mowat a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada le 22 avril 2010. Compte tenu des circonstances, et dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice, il convient d'attendre que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada rende une d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Mowat. Par la suite, si la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada rend un jugement qui \u00e9tablit clairement la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal pour adjuger des frais juridiques en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal recevra les observations des parties quant \u00e0 l'importance des frais juridiques.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

(1985), ch. H-6 ( la Loi ) de la part du Conseil des Montagnais de Nutashkuan (l\u2019intim\u00e9). Trois des plaignantes, \u00c9velyne Malec, Sylvie Malec et Estelle Kaltush, all\u00e8guent \u00e9galement que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 ou menac\u00e9 d\u2019exercer contre elles des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leurs plaintes, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi.\n[2] La plaignante \u00c9velyne Malec est enseignante en adaptation scolaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun de la communaut\u00e9 innue de Nutashkuan. Depuis 2001, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire 2003-2004, elle a travaill\u00e9, sans interruption, \u00e0 cette \u00e9cole.

Les faits li\u00e9s aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination A. La Communaut\u00e9 innue de Nutashkuan [12] Sise sur les rives du golfe du Saint-Laurent, la Communaut\u00e9 innue de Nutashkuan se trouve \u00e0 376 kilom\u00e8tres \u00e0 l\u2019est de Sept-\u00celes, dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec. Le territoire de la communaut\u00e9 a une fronti\u00e8re commune avec la municipalit\u00e9 de Natashquan et est accessible par la route 138 depuis 1996. La population de la communaut\u00e9 se situe \u00e0 environ 1 000 personnes.\n[13] La Communaut\u00e9 innue de Nutashkuan est dot\u00e9e des principales infrastructures que l\u2019on retrouve habituellement dans les communaut\u00e9s autochtones dont, entre autres, une \u00e9cole. Avant 1990, cette \u00e9cole relevait du minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien (le MAINC). Depuis 1990, l\u2019\u00e9cole est sous l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Un conseiller est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour assumer la responsabilit\u00e9 du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Au moment pertinent \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Nicolas Wapistan occupait cette fonction.\n[14] L\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun compte \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 160 \u00e9tudiants : 60 dans le secteur secondaire et 102 dans le secteur primaire. Le corps professoral est compos\u00e9 de onze (11) enseignants au niveau secondaire et huit (8) enseignants au niveau du primaire. Neuf (9) des dix-neuf (19) enseignants sont des Innus.\n[15] L\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun conna\u00eet, depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es, un roulement important de directeurs. Ceux-ci se sont succ\u00e9d\u00e9 ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e, ce qui a compliqu\u00e9 les relations entre la direction et les professeurs.\n[16] Le village voisin de Natashquan a \u00e9galement son \u00e9cole, l\u2019\u00e9cole Roger-Martineau. Cette \u00e9cole provinciale rel\u00e8ve de la Commission scolaire qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de la Moyenne-C\u00f4te-Nord. L\u2019\u00e9cole Roger-Martineau est situ\u00e9e \u00e0 quelque cinq kilom\u00e8tres de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun. Elle compte 108 \u00e9l\u00e8ves du primaire au secondaire. La proportion d\u2019\u00e9tudiants qui sont des Innus inscrits au primaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Roger-Martineau est d\u2019\u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s 75 % et elle est d\u2019environ 70 % au secondaire. Cette \u00e9cole offre les programmes de la pr\u00e9maternelle au Secondaire III. Pour le Secondaire IV et V, les \u00e9tudiants fr\u00e9quentent l\u2019\u00e9cole Monseigneur-Labrie de Havre-Saint-Pierre, \u00e0 quelque 150 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan.\n[17] Le 31 mars 2005, l\u2019intim\u00e9 cumulait un d\u00e9ficit financier d\u00e9passant les cinq (5) millions de dollars. Cons\u00e9quemment, au d\u00e9but du mois d\u2019avril 2005, le MAINC nommait un cogestionnaire pour administrer les finances de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Voyant que, malgr\u00e9 la nomination d\u2019un cogestionnaire, la situation financi\u00e8re ne s\u2019am\u00e9liorait pas, le MAINC a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en octobre 2005, de nommer un s\u00e9questre-administrateur pour g\u00e9rer les fonds afin d\u2019\u00e9viter que l'argent servant \u00e0 la livraison des services aux membres de la communaut\u00e9 ne soit saisi par les cr\u00e9anciers de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Quelques semaines plus tard, le minist\u00e8re de Sant\u00e9 Canada fit de m\u00eame.\n[18] Le MAINC et Sant\u00e9 Canada ont mandat\u00e9 la firme BDL Conseiller en administration pour agir \u00e0 titre de s\u00e9questre-administrateur. Dominique Blackburn \u00e9tait le repr\u00e9sentant de la firme BDL dans le cadre de cette mise sous s\u00e9questre. Le mandat du s\u00e9questre comporte trois volets :\nlivrer les services essentiels aux membres de la communaut\u00e9 ; aider l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer un plan de remboursement de ses dettes ; agir comme facilitateur avec les principaux partenaires, fournisseurs, institutions financi\u00e8res et minist\u00e8res.\n[19] \u00c0 partir du 1er octobre 2005, toutes les d\u00e9penses de l\u2019intim\u00e9 devaient pr\u00e9alablement \u00eatre approuv\u00e9es par le s\u00e9questre, y compris celles du secteur d\u2019\u00e9ducation.\n[20] \u00c0 la suite de la nomination du s\u00e9questre-administrateur, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un plan afin de redresser ses finances et mettre en place une structure organisationnelle et des politiques administratives qui lui permettraient de dispenser les services aux membres de la communaut\u00e9. Ce plan de redressement fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et adopt\u00e9 par le MAINC en 2006. Ce plan d\u00e9montrait que les budgets du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation, entre autres, devaient \u00eatre r\u00e9ajust\u00e9s puisque ce secteur avait cumul\u00e9 des d\u00e9ficits importants au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Les probl\u00e8mes que rencontrait le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation avaient eu pour cons\u00e9quence que plusieurs parents de la communaut\u00e9 de Nutashkuan avaient pris la d\u00e9cision de ne plus envoyer leur enfant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole de la communaut\u00e9, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant plut\u00f4t les envoyer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Roger-Martineau dans le village de Natashquan. Puisque le financement scolaire dans les communaut\u00e9s autochtones est bas\u00e9 sur le nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves, le d\u00e9part de plusieurs \u00e9l\u00e8ves vers les \u00e9coles de la Commission scolaire de la Moyenne C\u00f4te-Nord s\u2019est traduit par un manque \u00e0 gagner annuel important pour le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation.\n[21] En plus de mesures administratives et financi\u00e8res, le plan de redressement du Conseil pr\u00e9voyait que le Conseil actualise et \u00e9labore diff\u00e9rentes politiques administratives et financi\u00e8res. \u00c0 cet effet, une politique de la gestion financi\u00e8re et une politique de gestion des ressources humaines (incluant le secteur de l\u2019\u00c9ducation) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2007. Ces politiques avaient pour objectif de remettre de l\u2019ordre dans l\u2019administration des services livr\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et dans le traitement de ses employ\u00e9s.\n[22] Depuis le 31 mars 2009, le MAINC a lev\u00e9 la mise sous s\u00e9questre. Pour sa part, Sant\u00e9-Canada a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de maintenir le s\u00e9questre pour un certain temps encore. En ce qui concerne le MAINC, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est maintenant en mode de cogestion.\n[23] Andr\u00e9 Barrette travaillait \u00e9galement pour le s\u00e9questre-administrateur, BDL. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne connaissait pas personnellement les plaignantes et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u de ses sup\u00e9rieures d\u2019instruction particuli\u00e8re concernant le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Il dit avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 des plaintes par Jules Wapistan, le coordonnateur finance et administration de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les questions concernant le personnel \u00e9taient laiss\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Wapistan et \u00e0 Dominique Blackburn, de BDL. M. Blackburn n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\nB. Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination [24] En juin 2005, le traitement du personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun \u00e9tait r\u00e9gi par un document intitul\u00e9 Entente intervenue entre le Conseil des Montagnais de Nutashkuan et le personnel de l\u2019\u00c9cole Uauitshitun de Nutashkuan \u2013 Convention r\u00e9ciproque de traitement du personnel de l\u2019\u00c9cole Uauitshitun de Nutashkuan. Selon la preuve, il semble qu\u2019une politique similaire \u00e9tait en vigueur au moins depuis 1990, l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9cole est tomb\u00e9e sous la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nCette entente pr\u00e9voyait, entre autres :\n3.13 Lieu de r\u00e9sidence permanent ?\nDomicile au sens l\u00e9gal du terme au moment de l\u2019embauche, dans la mesure o\u00f9 ce domicile est situ\u00e9 dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec.\n[\u2026]\n6.5 Primes d\u2019\u00e9loignement au personnel enseignant d\u00e9tenteurs au minimum d\u2019un Bac et au personnel professionnel ayant la m\u00eame scolarit\u00e9.\n6.5.1 La prime annuelle d\u2019\u00e9loignement est cr\u00e9dit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 qui en b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie en 26 versements semi-mensuels au moment de la p\u00e9riode de paye.\n6.5.2 Le taux de la prime annuelle d\u2019\u00e9loignement est attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 selon qu\u2019il a au moins un d\u00e9pendant (enfant \u00e0 charge mineur) qui r\u00e9side en permanence au domicile de son lieu de travail ou qu\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sans d\u00e9pendant.\n6.5.3 Taux de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement\nAvec enfant(s) \u00e0 charge : $ 6 000 Sans enfant \u00e0 charge : $ 3 000.\nN.B.

Selon les plaignantes, cette politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e par les professeurs de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun. Elles all\u00e8guent \u00e9galement que la nouvelle politique n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal sugg\u00e9rant que cette politique devait imp\u00e9rativement \u00eatre approuv\u00e9e par les enseignants pour \u00eatre en vigueur. En ce qui concerne la question \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a ou non adopt\u00e9 formellement cette politique, cette question n\u2019a jamais vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9claircie \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Quoi qu'il en soit, il semble clair qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de f\u00e9vrier 2007, tout le monde agissait comme si cette politique \u00e9tait en vigueur.\n[26] Cette politique pr\u00e9voit entre autres :\n4.15 R\u00e9sident\nToute personne occupant un emploi pour le Conseil dont le lieu de r\u00e9sidence ordinaire et principale et\/ou celui de son conjoint est Nutashkuan ou \u00e0 moins de 50 km de Nutashkuan sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme r\u00e9sidente au sens de la politique d\u2019emploi du Conseil.\nLe statut de r\u00e9sidence de l\u2019employ\u00e9e peut changer en cours d\u2019emploi et le Conseil se r\u00e9serve le droit de r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le statut de r\u00e9sidence de ses employ\u00e9s du secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation annuellement.\n(L\u2019article 55 de la Loi \u00e9lectorale du Canada d\u00e9finit le lieu de r\u00e9sidence comme suit : Le lieu de r\u00e9sidence ordinaire d\u2019une personne est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral l\u2019endroit qui a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 ou qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le lieu de son habitation ou sa demeure o\u00f9 elle entend revenir lorsqu\u2019elle est absente.)\n[\u2026]\n10.7 Prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement au personnel enseignant et au personnel professionnel non r\u00e9sidents\na.

L\u2019intim\u00e9 utilisera d\u2019ailleurs cette exception pour affirmer que sa politique n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire envers les enseignants autochtones.\n[28] Le 21 f\u00e9vrier 2007, certains enseignants non-autochtones, r\u00e9sidants \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du rayon de 50 kilom\u00e8tres, re\u00e7oivent une lettre de la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole les informant que la nouvelle politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 doit demeurer \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un rayon de 50 km pour avoir droit \u00e0 une allocation de loyer et de sorties. La lettre mentionne \u00e9galement que la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole avait constat\u00e9 que certains enseignants qui recevaient ces primes poss\u00e9daient une r\u00e9sidence permanente \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de ce rayon. Ces enseignants n\u2019\u00e9taient donc plus admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019allocation de 450 $ par mois pour le loyer ainsi qu\u2019aux allocations pour les trois sorties annuelles. La lettre informait \u00e9galement les enseignants qu\u2019\u00e0 compter du 22 f\u00e9vrier 2007, ils ne recevraient plus d\u2019allocation pour ces avantages et qu\u2019ils devraient rembourser certaines sommes qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9es par erreur depuis le d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire 2006-2007. La lettre ne fait aucune mention de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement. Toutefois, l\u2019article 10.7 de la nouvelle politique mentionne clairement que dor\u00e9navant la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement ne sera vers\u00e9e qu\u2019aux enseignants non r\u00e9sidents.\n[29] Les plaignantes all\u00e8guent que la politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant ces primes discrimine contre les enseignants innus puisque ceux-ci n\u2019ont pas droit aux m\u00eames avantages que ceux qui sont ou \u00e9taient accord\u00e9s aux enseignants non-autochtones.\nC. Le cadre juridique [30] Le but de la Loi est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 2 et se lit comme suit :\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de compl\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n[31] Les textes l\u00e9gislatifs sur les droits de la personne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crits comme \u00e9tant ...d'une nature sp\u00e9ciale. [Ils ne sont] pas vraiment de nature constitutionnelle, mais [...] certainement d'une nature qui sort de l'ordinaire. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S., pages 536 \u00e0 547). La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9labor\u00e9 davantage sur le but et les objectifs de ces textes l\u00e9gislatifs et sur la mani\u00e8re dont devait \u00eatre abord\u00e9e leur interpr\u00e9tation dans l'arr\u00eat Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114 \u00e0 1134 (sub nomine : Action Travail des Femmes) :\nLa l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu'en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu'elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet.\n[32] L'article 7 de la Loi \u00e9nonce que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d'emploi. Selon l\u2019article 3, sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des motifs de distinction illicite ceux qui sont, entre autres, fond\u00e9s sur la race, la religion et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique.\n[33] Depuis les d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame dans les arr\u00eats Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [ appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Meiorin ] et Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 [ appel\u00e9 \u00e9galement Grismer ], la distinction classique entre la discrimination directe et la discrimination indirecte fait place \u00e0 une m\u00e9thode unifi\u00e9e de traitement des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Selon cette m\u00e9thode, il incombe d\u2019abord \u00e0 la partie plaignante d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e.\n[34] Une fois qu\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, il revient \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e soit d\u2019\u00e9tablir qu\u2019aucun motif de distinction illicite n\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent dans la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique ou norme discriminatoire comporte un motif justifiable. Dans cette optique, la partie intim\u00e9e doit prouver :\nqu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme \u00e0 une fin ou dans un but qui est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 la fonction ex\u00e9cut\u00e9e. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l\u2019analyse porte non pas sur la validit\u00e9 de la norme particuli\u00e8re en cause, mais plut\u00f4t sur la validit\u00e9 de son objet plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. qu\u2019elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu\u2019elle ait eu l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers le demandeur. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, l\u2019analyse passe de l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme \u00e0 la norme elle-m\u00eame. que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour atteindre le but poursuivi. L\u2019employeur doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ne peut composer avec le demandeur et les autres personnes touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir une contrainte excessive. (Voir notamment l\u2019article 15 de la Loi.)\n[35] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il incombe donc d'abord aux plaignantes d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de leur race ou de leur origine nationale ou ethnique. Comme nous venons de le voir une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28).\n[36] L\u2019argument des plaignantes est qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 discrimin\u00e9es en raison de leur statut d\u2019autochtones par rapport aux enseignants non-autochtones. Elles soutiennent sp\u00e9cifiquement que l\u2019intim\u00e9 les a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cour d\u2019emploi en leur refusant certains b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu\u2019il accordait aux enseignants non autochtones. Elles font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence notamment aux primes de logement, d\u2019\u00e9loignement et aux allocations de sorties pr\u00e9vues dans les politiques de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[37] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient dans sa r\u00e9ponse que les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve que la politique en question comporte un motif justifiable au sens des d\u00e9cisions Meiorin et Grismer. Dans ses arguments finaux, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soutenu que faire droit aux demandes des plaignantes imposerait un fardeau tel \u00e0 son client qu\u2019il replongerait la communaut\u00e9 dans une crise financi\u00e8re. Mais, encore une fois, aucune preuve tangible n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise pour appuyer cette all\u00e9gation.\n(i) La prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement [38] Jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2007, la politique qui s\u2019appliquait aux enseignants de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun pr\u00e9voyait le versement d\u2019une prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement au personnel enseignant qui d\u00e9tient au minimum un baccalaur\u00e9at et au personnel professionnel ayant la m\u00eame scolarit\u00e9 peu importe la distance entre leur lieu de r\u00e9sidence permanente et l\u2019\u00e9cole. Le taux de la prime variait selon que l\u2019enseignant avait des enfants \u00e0 charge ($6 000), qui r\u00e9sident en permanence avec lui, ou qu\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sans enfant \u00e0 charge (3 000 $). De plus, la politique \u00e9tablissait que si deux employ\u00e9s sont mari\u00e9s ou sont des conjoints de fait, un seul des deux peut r\u00e9clamer la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement pour enfant \u00e0 charge et l\u2019autre employ\u00e9(e) b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement sans enfant \u00e0 charge.\n[39] Le Tribunal constate qu\u2019en ce qui concerne la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement la politique ne fait aucune distinction entre les enseignants r\u00e9sidents ou ceux qui ne le sont pas. Rien dans la politique n\u2019indique qu\u2019elle est vers\u00e9e en guise de boni pour le recrutement ou pour faciliter le recrutement d\u2019enseignants provenant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9gion de Natashquan.\n[40] Il est, par ailleurs, clair que les seuls enseignants \u00e0 qui cette prime \u00e9tait vers\u00e9e sont les enseignants non autochtones, bien qu\u2019il soit arriv\u00e9 une fois qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 une enseignante autochtone dont le statut avait \u00e9t\u00e9 acquis en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[41] Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour expliquer l\u2019origine ou la raison d\u2019\u00eatre sous-jacente de cette prime. Pendant la pr\u00e9sentation de son argumentation finale, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019en est remis essentiellement aux t\u00e9moignages de certaines des plaignantes qui avaient t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement \u00e9tait vers\u00e9e aux enseignants non autochtones venant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur, pour en tirer la conclusion que ces t\u00e9moignages \u00e9taient des admissions quant \u00e0 la raison d\u2019\u00eatre de la prime et que son versement \u00e0 certains enseignants seulement ne pouvait donc \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme discriminatoire. Le Tribunal ne peut souscrire \u00e0 cette conclusion. Le fait que certaines plaignantes aient fait cette affirmation ne peut avoir pour effet de justifier la politique concernant le versement de ces primes. Le Tribunal est plut\u00f4t d\u2019avis qu\u2019en donnant ces r\u00e9ponses les plaignantes ne faisaient que relater un \u00e9tat de fait connu de tous au sein du corps enseignant, \u00e0 savoir que les enseignants non autochtones recevaient cette prime. De plus, la preuve non contest\u00e9e montre clairement que jusqu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2007, des enseignants non autochtones, r\u00e9sidant en permanence dans la r\u00e9gion de Natashquan recevaient la prime. Le fait qu\u2019une enseignante ayant le statut d\u2019autochtone ait re\u00e7u \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 la prime ne change pas notre conclusion. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour justifier la raison pour laquelle cette prime n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vers\u00e9e aux enseignantes innues de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun.\n[42] En 2007, l\u2019intim\u00e9 adopte une politique des ressources humaines pour le personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, laquelle politique remplacera l\u2019entente de 2005. Cette politique pr\u00e9voit que toute personne occupant un emploi pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 dont le lieu de r\u00e9sidence ordinaire et principale est Nutashkuan ou \u00e0 moins de 50 km de Nutashkuan sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme r\u00e9sidante.\n[43] En ce qui concerne la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement, nous remarquons peu de changement dans la nouvelle politique, sauf qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019article 10.7, la prime n\u2019est maintenant vers\u00e9e qu\u2019aux enseignants non-r\u00e9sidents. Dor\u00e9navant, la politique ne fait plus de diff\u00e9rence entre enseignants autochtones et non-autochtones. La distinction sera uniquement fond\u00e9e sur le lieu de r\u00e9sidence.\n[44] Consid\u00e9rant l\u2019ensemble de la preuve soumise \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le Tribunal conclut que les plaignantes ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que jusqu\u2019en 2007, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de leur race par le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de leur verser une prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement alors qu\u2019une telle prime \u00e9tait vers\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les enseignants non autochtones r\u00e9sidants.\n[45] Le fardeau incombe donc maintenant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que son refus de verser aux plaignantes la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement comporte un motif justifiable. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve pour justifier l\u2019existence de ce traitement in\u00e9gal. En plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir que le traitement s\u2019expliquait en raison de la r\u00e9sidence permanente des r\u00e9cipiendaires plut\u00f4t que de leur race\/origine ethnique ou nationales. Les dites admissions des plaignante ne poss\u00e8dent pas une valeur probante permettant une telle conclusion ou pratique.\n[46] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que les plaignantes ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'avant 2007, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de leur race, contrairement \u00e0 ce qui est pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, par le traitement qu\u2019elles recevaient de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui refusait de leur verser une prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement alors qu\u2019une telle prime \u00e9tait vers\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les enseignants non autochtones, r\u00e9sidents ou non.\n(ii) L\u2019allocation pour sorties annuelles [47] Avant 2007, l\u2019entente avec le personnel enseignant pr\u00e9voyait une allocation pour sorties annuelles pour les employ\u00e9s provenant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan. Les allocations pour sorties annuelles sont au nombre de trois (3) et le calendrier de ces sorties est \u00e9tabli comme suit : premi\u00e8re sortie, lors de l\u2019entr\u00e9e en poste en d\u00e9but d'ann\u00e9e et d\u00e9part pour les vacances ; deuxi\u00e8me sortie, No\u00ebl ; et, troisi\u00e8me sortie, P\u00e2ques ou la semaine de rel\u00e2che. L\u2019allocation pour les sorties annuelles est la suivante, selon la ville de r\u00e9sidence au moment de l\u2019embauche de l\u2019employ\u00e9 et inclus l\u2019aller et le retour : Montr\u00e9al, 950 $; Qu\u00e9bec, 750 $; et, Sept-\u00celes, 300 $.\n[48] Il est clair d\u2019apr\u00e8s le libell\u00e9 de la politique que cette allocation vise les employ\u00e9s dont le lieu de r\u00e9sidence se trouve \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan. La nouvelle politique adopt\u00e9e en 2007 n\u2019apporte aucun changement \u00e0 ce niveau, autre que de d\u00e9finir avec un peu plus de pr\u00e9cision l\u2019expression r\u00e9sident. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait pu par le pass\u00e9 verser cette allocation \u00e0 des enseignants qui r\u00e9sident \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres \u2013 c\u2019est le cas par exemple de M. Richard Boies \u2013 il est \u00e9vident que l\u2019intention de cette allocation est de permettre aux enseignants non r\u00e9sidents de pouvoir retourner au moins trois fois par ann\u00e9e dans leur ville de r\u00e9sidence. En ce qui concerne les versements qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 des enseignants qui n\u2019y avaient pas droit, la lettre de f\u00e9vrier 2007 semble vouloir corriger la situation.\n[49] Le Tribunal ne peut conclure, eu \u00e9gard au versement de cette allocation, que les plaignantes ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en raison de leur race par le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de leur verser une allocation pour sorties annuelles. Aucune preuve n\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019une des plaignantes ou qu\u2019un enseignant innu r\u00e9sident \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres s\u2019est vu refuser cette allocation.\n[50] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que les plaignantes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de leur race par la le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de leur verser une allocation annuelle de sortie aux enseignants r\u00e9sident \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan.\n(iii) L\u2019allocation de logement [51] La politique en vigueur avant 2007 pr\u00e9voyait que le conseil attribue une allocation mensuelle de logement de 450 $ \u00e0 ses enseignants. Rien dans cette politique n\u2019indique que l\u2019allocation est vers\u00e9e uniquement aux enseignants qui ne r\u00e9sident pas \u00e0 Natashquan ou dans un rayon de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan. La politique adopt\u00e9 en 2007 pr\u00e9voit maintenant que cette allocation mensuelle est uniquement vers\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s non-r\u00e9sidents, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e0 ceux et celles qui habitent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur d\u2019un p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres de Natashquan.\n[52] Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2007, tous les enseignants non autochtones recevaient cette allocation de logement. Les enseignantes autochtones, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019enseignante dont nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait mention qui avait le statut d\u2019autochtone, ne recevaient pas cette allocation. En 2007, comme ce fut le cas pour l\u2019allocation pour les sorties annuelles, les enseignants non autochtones r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du p\u00e9rim\u00e8tre de 50 kilom\u00e8tres furent avis\u00e9s qu\u2019ils ne recevraient plus cette allocation. Par cons\u00e9quent, depuis 2007, il n\u2019est plus possible d\u2019affirmer que les enseignantes non autochtones sont les seules \u00e0 ne pas recevoir cette allocation.\n[53] Peut-on conclure que le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser cette allocation aux enseignantes autochtones, jusqu\u2019en 2007, constitue un acte discriminatoire contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 7 de la Loi ?\n[54] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience a \u00e9tabli que l\u2019objectif de cette allocation \u00e9tait d\u2019aider les enseignants non r\u00e9sidents \u00e0 d\u00e9frayer les co\u00fbts de leur logement dans le village de Natashquan ou ses environs. Mme Genevi\u00e8ve Tacshereau-N\u00e9aschit, un t\u00e9moin pour l\u2019intim\u00e9, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait assez difficile pour les enseignants provenant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la r\u00e9gion de se trouver un logement ad\u00e9quat \u00e0 un prix raisonnable dans la r\u00e9gion. Cette preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par les plaignantes.\n[55] En ce qui concerne les plaignantes qui, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019\u00c9velyne Malec, habitent toutes sur le territoire de la communaut\u00e9 innue de Nutashkuan, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elles b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de certains avantages au niveau de l\u2019habitation. La question de savoir si ceux-ci sont appropri\u00e9s ou non n\u2019est pas du ressort du Tribunal. Il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019elles pouvaient profiter des politiques de logement de l\u2019intim\u00e9, ce que ne pouvaient faire les enseignants qui ne sont pas Innus. D\u2019ailleurs, aucune des plaignantes n\u2019a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 payer 450 $ ou plus par mois pour son logement. Certaines ont m\u00eame t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne rien payer du tout. En ce qui concerne, \u00c9velyne Malec, la preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle ne pourrait recevoir cette allocation, car pendant la p\u00e9riode de son emploi son conjoint, Richard Boies a re\u00e7u l\u2019allocation de 450 $ par mois.\n[56] Quoi qu'il en soit, le Tribunal ne peut pas conclure sur la base de la preuve qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e que les plaignantes ont \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9es en cours d\u2019emploi en raison de leur race par la politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de verser une allocation mensuelle aux enseignants non autochtones.\nII. Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles A. L\u2019\u00e9tat du droit [57] Avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, les plaignantes ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en modification de leur plainte afin d\u2019ajouter des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre plusieurs d\u2019entre elles en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi. Le tribunal a accueilli cette requ\u00eate dans sa d\u00e9cision rapport\u00e9e dans Malec et al. c. Conseil des Montagnais de Natashquan, 2009 TCDP 5.\n[58] En vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[59] L\u2019exercice de repr\u00e9sailles comporte une certaine forme d\u2019acte volontaire visant \u00e0 infliger un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la personne qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte relative aux droits de la personne pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette plainte. Comme le souligne le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Virk c. Bell Canada (Ontario), 2005 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 156 : Ce point de vue d\u00e9roge en partie \u00e0 ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal sur la question des repr\u00e9sailles (Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, [2001] TCDP 11 ; Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et de Stoney Point, 2004 CHRT 40.). Dans les d\u00e9cisions Bressette et Wong, le Tribunal avait conclu qu\u2019un plaignant n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 prouver une intention d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles. Il n\u2019avait qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il percevait raisonnablement que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 constitue des repr\u00e9sailles nonobstant l\u2019absence de preuve d\u2019une intention en ce sens de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le Tribunal adopte l\u2019approche propos\u00e9e dans Virk.\n[60] Dans le cas d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles c\u2019est au plaignant qu\u2019incombe le fardeau de prouver que celles-ci ont bel et bien eu lieu. Le plaignant doit donc prouver que la personne ou les personnes qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend avoir exerc\u00e9es des repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9taient au courant de l\u2019existence de la plainte, que cette personne ou ces personnes ont agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re inopportune et que la conduite de cette ou ces personnes a \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[61] Par cons\u00e9quent, ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire c\u2019est une preuve que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou ses repr\u00e9sentants ont exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles en \u00e9tant au courant de l\u2019existence de la plainte et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou ses repr\u00e9sentants ont agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re inopportune donnant ainsi naissance \u00e0 une preuve prima facie. Une fois la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablit, il revient \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de donner une explication raisonnable de ses actes. Si cette explication n\u2019est pas cr\u00e9dible, alors le Tribunal doit conclure que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles est justifi\u00e9e.\nB. Les faits ayant trait \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles (article 14.1 de la Loi) [62] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le repr\u00e9sentant des plaignantes a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e9taient uniquement port\u00e9es par les plaignantes, \u00c9velyne Malec, Sylvie Malec et Estelle Kaltush. Les pr\u00e9tendus actes de repr\u00e9sailles sont essentiellement constitu\u00e9s de mesures disciplinaires qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 prises entre le 9 septembre 2008 et le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2008. Les incidents qui appuient ces all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, pour chacune des plaignantes, dans les paragraphes qui suivent.\n(i) \u00c9velyne Malec [63] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante pour soutenir les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles porte particuli\u00e8rement sur ses relations avec le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun, Marcel Rodrigue.\n[64] M. Rodrigue a \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement embauch\u00e9 comme directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00e0 la fin ao\u00fbt 2008, soit quelques jours avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire. D\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, les relations entre le nouveau directeur et la plaignante seront tendues. Par exemple, Mme Malec relate que lors de sa premi\u00e8re rencontre, le nouveau directeur lui aurait dit C\u2019est vous, madame Malec? On m\u2019a beaucoup parl\u00e9 de vous. Un peu plus tard elle dira qu\u2019il lui a dit C\u2019est vous \u00c9velyne Malec? Moi j\u2019entends bien des affaires sur toi. Elle ajoute \u00e9galement qu\u2019il lui a dit qu\u2019il va y avoir des contestataires politiques. Bien qu\u2019il ne lui ait pas parl\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment des proc\u00e9dures entam\u00e9es sous la Loi, la plaignante est certaine qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 au courant de ces d\u00e9marches, car tout se dit \u00e0 BDL.\n[65] M. Rodrigue confirmera qu\u2019avant d\u2019accepter le poste de directeur, qu\u2019il avait discut\u00e9 de la situation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun avec son pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur. Celui-ci lui aurait alors demand\u00e9 s\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 g\u00e9rer l\u2019opposition, car tu vas en avoir. Il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans cette conversation des plaintes ou des plaignantes.\n[66] En ce que qui concerne les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Malec, le premier incident se serait produit le 28 ao\u00fbt 2008. Ce jour-l\u00e0, la plaignante est convoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 une rencontre par le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il l\u2019informe qu\u2019une autre enseignante avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre elle une plainte interne \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une altercation qu\u2019elles auraient eue la journ\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Selon la plaignante, le directeur ne lui aurait fait aucun reproche lors de cette rencontre. Elle dit lui avoir donn\u00e9 sa version des faits concernant l\u2019altercation. Le directeur lui aurait indiqu\u00e9 que cela confirmait ce que l\u2019autre enseignante d\u00e9crivait dans sa lettre. Il aurait m\u00eame ajout\u00e9, selon la plaignante, qu\u2019il appr\u00e9ciait son honn\u00eatet\u00e9. Pourtant un peu plus loin dans son contre-interrogatoire, elle ajoutera : Il [le directeur] a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 impoli avec moi. Depuis ma premi\u00e8re rencontre, il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 impoli, il me traite comme si je n\u2019\u00e9tais rien.. Or, il est difficile de conclure \u00e0 partir de sa description du d\u00e9roulement de cette rencontre que le directeur a agi impoliment \u00e0 son endroit. Le simple fait qu\u2019il ait dit qu\u2019il appr\u00e9ciait son honn\u00eatet\u00e9 semble contraire \u00e0 une attitude qui d\u00e9montrerait de l\u2019impolitesse ou de l\u2019ingratitude.\n[67] Le 3 septembre 2008, Mme Malec re\u00e7oit un avertissement verbal de M. Rodrigue concernant l\u2019altercation qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produite le 27 ao\u00fbt, 2008. La plaignante indique que le directeur l\u2019aurait alors bl\u00e2m\u00e9 pour cet incident.\n[68] M. Rodrigue pr\u00e9cisera lors de son t\u00e9moignage que le 3 septembre, il n\u2019avait aucune connaissance des plaintes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la Loi. Il ajoute n\u2019avoir entendu parler pour la premi\u00e8re fois de ces plaintes que vers la fin octobre 2008, lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union avec le corps professoral. Quelqu\u2019un aurait alors fait mention des plaintes, mais il ajoute que pour lui cela ne lui disait rien, car dans ma t\u00eate, \u00e7a ne relevait pas de moi. Je ne savais pas quelles personnes faisaient parties de ce recours. Il ajoutera qu\u2019au mois de mai 2009, la plaignante \u00c9velyne Malec, l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il allait \u00eatre convoqu\u00e9 \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire au d\u00e9but juin, mais il ajoute qu\u2019il ne savait pas de quoi elle parlait. Il dit avoir constat\u00e9 au d\u00e9but juin que plusieurs professeurs \u00e9taient absents. La secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019\u00e9cole l\u2019aurait alors inform\u00e9 qu\u2019ils participaient \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il dit n\u2019avoir formellement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures et qui \u00e9taient les plaignantes qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin juin ou au d\u00e9but juillet 2009. J\u2019ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter cette partie du t\u00e9moignage de M. Rodrigue. La Communaut\u00e9 innue de Natashquan n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s grande. L\u2019\u00e9cole est \u00e9galement relativement petite. Lorsque huit (8) enseignantes d\u00e9posent ensemble une plainte all\u00e9guant discrimination, m\u00eame dans une tr\u00e8s grande \u00e9cole, il m\u2019appara\u00eet fort improbable que la direction ne soit pas au courant. Je comprends que M. Rodrigue ne se soit peut-\u00eatre pas senti interpell\u00e9 par ces plaintes qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait \u00eatre l\u2019affaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou du s\u00e9questre-administrateur, mais de l\u00e0 \u00e0 dire qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant, il y toute une diff\u00e9rence.\n[69] Le 9 septembre 2008, la plaignante re\u00e7oit cette fois un avertissement \u00e9crit. La lettre d\u00e9bute en affirmant qu\u2019 [e]n septembre 2007 [le directeur] vous a rencontr\u00e9 pour vous donner un avertissement verbal vous enjoignant de cesser vos sautes d\u2019humeur, de temp\u00e9rer et nuancer vos propos, suite \u00e0 une rencontre entre les enseignants et la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole. La lettre poursuit : Malgr\u00e9 cet avertissement, nous avons appris, selon les informations qui nous ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es et selon ce que nous avons constat\u00e9, que votre attitude n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9 et que vous continuez d\u2019avoir des agissements inacceptables.. La lettre d\u00e9crit par la suite un autre incident qui se serait produit entre Mme Malec et l\u2019enseignante dont il est question dans la premi\u00e8re altercation. Apr\u00e8s avoir rencontr\u00e9 les deux enseignantes, la direction conclut : Nous consid\u00e9rons que les propos tenus lors de cette altercation constituent un manque de respect grave, enfreignant les r\u00e8gles d\u2019\u00e9thique \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le Manuel des politiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de gestion des ressources humaines du conseil des Innus de Nutashkuan. En cons\u00e9quence, veuillez consid\u00e9rer cette lettre, comme un avertissement \u00e9crit\u2026 Si [d]es correctifs ne sont pas apport\u00e9s, nous devrons proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape des mesures disciplinaires, soit la suspension\n[70] M. Rodrigue pr\u00e9cise que cette lettre aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une rencontre \u00e0 laquelle aurait particip\u00e9 Andr\u00e9 Barette, de BDL, Jules Wapistan, Nicolas Wapistan, et Estelle Kaltush. Les quatre autres participants n\u2019ont pas mentionn\u00e9 cette rencontre dans leur t\u00e9moignage. Selon M. Rodrigue, on l\u2019aurait alors inform\u00e9 qu\u2019un avertissement verbal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Malec par l\u2019ancien directeur Andr\u00e9 Leclerc. Toutefois, Andr\u00e9 Leclerc a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas connaissance de conflits avec \u00c9velyne Malec qui aurait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 des interventions ou des mesures disciplinaires.\n[71] Selon la plaignante, l\u2019all\u00e9gation qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ue un avertissement verbal en septembre 2007 est fausse. Elle affirme qu\u2019avant le 3 septembre 2008 aucune mesure disciplinaire n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise contre elle. Le Tribunal note qu\u2019aucune preuve de mesures disciplinaires contre la plaignante \u00c9velyne Malec en septembre 2007 n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience. Par ailleurs, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Marcel Rodrigue dira qu\u2019il n\u2019a rien trouv\u00e9 dans le dossier de Mme Malec mentionnant un avertissement verbal durant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[72] M. Rodrigue t\u00e9moignera \u00e9galement qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite de l\u2019envoi de cette lettre, qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u la visite de Richard Boies, \u00c9velyne Malec et Nicolas Wapistan \u00e0 son bureau. Il ajoute qu\u2019Estelle Kaltush s\u2019est \u00e9galement introduite \u00e0 la r\u00e9union. \u00c0 ce moment, il dit avoir eu toute une crise de la part de \u00c9velyne Malec et Richard Boies.\n[73] L\u2019avertissement \u00e9crit du 9 septembre 2008 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9 non seulement par le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole, Marcel Rodrigue, mais \u00e9galement par la directrice adjointe, Estelle Kaltush, l\u2019une des plaignantes. En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Malec t\u00e9moignera qu\u2019Estelle Kaltush lui aurait dit qu\u2019elle avait sign\u00e9 cette lettre sous la contrainte exerc\u00e9e par l\u2019employeur. Toutefois, Mme Malec n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019indiquer qui chez l\u2019employeur avait exerc\u00e9 cette contrainte et a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas pos\u00e9 cette question \u00e0 Mme Kaltush. M. Rodrigue t\u00e9moignera qu\u2019il n\u2019a aucun souvenir que Mme Kaltush ait \u00e9mis des r\u00e9serves lorsqu\u2019elle a sign\u00e9 la lettre. Mme Kaltush ne sera pas questionn\u00e9e sur ce point.\n[74] Le 14 octobre 2008, M. Rodrigue envoie une lettre \u00e0 Dominique Blackburn, le repr\u00e9sentant du s\u00e9questre-administrateur. Il dit qu\u2019il sentait le besoin d\u2019expliquer ce qui se passait \u00e0 son employeur. Dans cette lettre, il relate les \u00e9v\u00e9nements suivant :\nRe Evelyne Malec\n9 septembre avertissement \u00e9crit pour manque de respect ;\n17 septembre menace au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone par Francis Malec, fr\u00e8re de \u00c9velyne\n7 octobre R\u00e9union des enseignants du secondaire. \u00c9velyne me manque de respect \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union. Elle me traite de bouch\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises. Elle dit je la harc\u00e8le. Cela s\u2019est produit quand j\u2019ai tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question de Jacques Devost sur les d\u00e9parts de membres du personnel.\n10 octobre Je rencontre \u00c9velyne Malec \u00e0 mon bureau pour lui faire part de mon intention de lui faire un avis de suspension.\n10 octobre Nicolas t\u00e9l\u00e9phone \u00e0 Estelle pour qu\u2019elle me fasse le message de r\u00e9gler mes probl\u00e8mes avec \u00c9velyne.\n[75] M. Rodrigue t\u00e9moignera \u00e9galement, bien qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9cise pas la date, qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que certains professeurs avaient demand\u00e9 une rencontre avec le conseil de bande pour discuter de lui. Sans qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9cise qui, il dit qu\u2019on lui avait alors sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de rencontrer les professeurs afin de discuter de la question. Deux rencontres furent organis\u00e9es, par la suite, avec les professeurs : l\u2019une avec les professeurs du primaire, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par Estelle Kaltush, et l\u2019autre avec les professeurs du secondaire, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 par M. Rodrigue. Selon M. Rodrigue, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en train de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une question pos\u00e9e par un autre professeur, la plaignante, \u00c9velyne Malec, aurait piqu\u00e9 une crise et lui aurait dit qu\u2019[il] \u00e9tai[t] bouch\u00e9 et [qu\u2019il] la harcelais. Le 20 octobre 2008, apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, M. Rodrigue \u00e9crit \u00e0 Jules Wapistan pour lui d\u00e9crire l\u2019incident.\n[76] Mme Malec re\u00e7oit, le 21 octobre 2008, une lettre de Jules Wapistan, l\u2019informant qu\u2019elle est suspendue sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour une p\u00e9riode de cinq (5) jours. Les raisons invoqu\u00e9es pour cette suspension sont les suivantes: Au d\u00e9but de septembre 2008, vous avez re\u00e7u un avertissement verbal vous enjoignant de cesser vos sautes d\u2019humeur, de temp\u00e9rer et de nuancer vos propos. Le 9 septembre 2008, vous avez re\u00e7u un avertissement \u00e9crit vous enjoignant d\u2019adopter une attitude positive, de faire preuve de politesse et de respect envers vos coll\u00e8gues de travail et les membres de la direction. Faisant fi de cet avertissement \u00e9crit, le 7 octobre 2008, vous avez \u00e0 deux reprises trait\u00e9 le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole de bouch\u00e9. Il ne fait aucun doute que vous vous moquez compl\u00e8tement des avis que vous avez re\u00e7us puisque vous n\u2019avez aucunement modifi\u00e9 votre comportement inad\u00e9quat en tenant des propos irrespectueux envers le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Cette lettre indiquait \u00e9galement que la plaignante \u00e9tait suspendue de [ses] fonctions, sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, pour la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant le 20 octobre 2008 jusqu\u2019au 24 octobre 2008..\n[77] En ce qui concerne cette lettre, le Tribunal constate que la date du d\u00e9but de la suspension (le 20 octobre 2008) est ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 la date de la lettre qui est le 21 octobre 2008. Cela explique, fort probablement, la nouvelle lettre du 27 octobre 2008, dans laquelle M. Wapistan \u00e9crit nous vous avons transmis un avis de suspension et, par erreur, nous avons indiqu\u00e9 dans cet avis que vous seriez suspendus du 20 au 24 octobre 2008. Cet avis vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmis par la poste et de fait, vous avez travaill\u00e9 toute cette semaine. La lettre avise la plaignante que sa suspension sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration prendrait maintenant effet pour la p\u00e9riode du 17 au 21 novembre 2008.\n[78] Toutefois, le 17 novembre 2008, la plaignante est en cong\u00e9 de maladie. Le 17 novembre 2008, M. Wapistan \u00e9crit donc \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 la plaignante : Compte tenu de votre absence pour raison m\u00e9dicale, soyez avis\u00e9e que votre suspension entrera donc en vigueur \u00e0 votre retour au travail, et ce, pour une p\u00e9riode compl\u00e8te d\u2019une semaine normale de travail.\n[79] Malgr\u00e9 ces incidents avec le directeur, la plaignante explique que l\u2019\u00e9valuation de son rendement par le directeur Marcel Rodrigue s\u2019est tr\u00e8s bien pass\u00e9e. Elle ajoute qu\u2019il l\u2019 a trouv\u00e9 comp\u00e9tente, bien qu\u2019il ait remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait des relations tendues avec le directeur. Nous pouvons pr\u00e9sumer que Mme Malec se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 son \u00e9valuation pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire 2008-2009, car c\u2019est la seule ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 M. Rodrigue \u00e9tait directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole. S\u2019il existe une version \u00e9crite de cette \u00e9valuation, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le tribunal constate cependant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 cette preuve.\n[80] Mme Malec relate \u00e9galement un incident qui se serait produit le 8 septembre 2008 lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union avec le personnel enseignant et le directeur de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Elle pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019en raison d\u2019obligations familiales, elle et son mari sont arriv\u00e9s en retard \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union. Elle ajoute que M. Rodrigue aurait alors demand\u00e9 qu\u2019ils inscrivent leur heure d\u2019arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de leurs noms sur la feuille de pr\u00e9sence. Pendant la r\u00e9union, la discussion a port\u00e9 sur le calendrier scolaire. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9, selon Mme Malec, le directeur aurait demand\u00e9 s\u2019il y avait un volontaire pour travailler avec lui sur la refonte du calendrier. Personne s\u2019\u00e9tant port\u00e9e volontaire, elle aurait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voulait le faire. Le directeur lui aurait r\u00e9pondu pas toi. Elle dit lui avoir demand\u00e9 les raisons de son refus et qu\u2019il lui a r\u00e9pondu que personne ne l\u2019avait d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[81] M. Rodrigue donne une interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9g\u00e8rement diff\u00e9rente de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 lors de cette rencontre. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, le calendrier scolaire doit comporter 180 jours de classe. Pendant l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire, cinq jours portant sur la culture innue sont normalement organis\u00e9s. M. Rodrigue dit qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 de ces jours de culture avec l\u2019ancien directeur et que celui-ci lui avait dit que ces journ\u00e9es n\u2019\u00e9taient pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des jours de classe. Or, la directrice adjointe, Estelle Kaltush, affirmait le contraire. Afin de tirer l\u2019affaire au clair, le directeur a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019organiser des rencontres s\u00e9par\u00e9es avec les professeurs du primaire et du secondaire. Selon M. Rodrigue, la rencontre avec les professeurs du primaire se serait bien pass\u00e9e, ceux-ci ayant accept\u00e9 d\u2019enlever la r\u00e9cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi pour r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer les heures scolaires perdues. Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 du secondaire, les choses ne furent pas aussi simples. Les professeurs du secondaire consid\u00e9raient ces journ\u00e9es de culture comme des journ\u00e9es de classe. Lors de cette rencontre, M. Rodrigue dit se rappeler que la plaignante lui ait offert son aide pour travailler \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration du calendrier scolaire. Il se rappelle lui avoir dit qu\u2019il ne pouvait accepter son offre, car elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par les autres professeurs. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il explique sa d\u00e9cision de refuser l\u2019offre de la plaignante en disant : Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas rendu-l\u00e0. J\u2019avais besoin de faire mes propres v\u00e9rifications et on reviendrait l\u00e0-dessus plus tard.\n[82] La plaignante a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le 27 novembre 2008, Jules Wapistan l\u2019aurait inform\u00e9 qu\u2019elle allait recevoir une nouvelle lettre disciplinaire puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas fait le calcul de ses minutes dans [s]on horaire de travail. Mme Malec pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019elle est alors all\u00e9e voir Marie-Anna Wapistan, la directrice du secondaire, \u00e0 qui elle se souvenait avoir remis son horaire avec le calcul de ses minutes et effectivement, le document en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9. M. Wapistan t\u00e9moignera qu\u2019il ne savait pas que la plaignante avait remis son horaire \u00e0 la directrice du secondaire et qu\u2019apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification il a bien vu que tel \u00e9tait le cas. Pour lui, le dossier \u00e9tait donc r\u00e9gl\u00e9. .\n(ii) Estelle Kaltush [83] Estelle Kaltush all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement qu\u2019elle a subi des repr\u00e9sailles en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[84] Elle all\u00e8gue, entre autres, qu\u2019un avertissement oral qu\u2019elle a re\u00e7u de son directeur le 28 novembre 2008 est un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. Cet avertissement lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 un incident qui se serait produit le 27 novembre. Selon la lettre, la plaignante aurait mis le directeur \u00e0 la porte de son bureau alors qu\u2019il voulait la rencontrer pour discuter de la relocalisation de son bureau. Le directeur consid\u00e9rait que la plaignante lui avait manqu\u00e9 gravement de politesse et de respect.\n[85] Le 26 janvier 2009, la plaignante re\u00e7oit un avertissement \u00e9crit concernant, cette fois, un incident qui se serait produit le 22 janvier 2009. Ce jour-l\u00e0, le directeur avait rencontr\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e8ve avec un probl\u00e8me disciplinaire. Selon lui, le plan d\u2019intervention avec cet \u00e9l\u00e8ve comportait l\u2019aide du psycho\u00e9ducateur de l\u2019\u00e9cole qui avait d\u2019ailleurs d\u00e9j\u00e0 rencontr\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tudiant. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s cette rencontre, le psycho\u00e9ducateur informe le directeur que le grand-p\u00e8re de l\u2019enfant venait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole pour le rencontrer. Cette rencontre n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vue dans le plan d\u2019intervention pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le directeur. Lors de la rencontre, \u00e0 laquelle assistaient le grand-p\u00e8re, le psycho\u00e9ducateur, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve, la plaignante et le directeur, le grand-p\u00e8re informe les participants que c\u2019est la plaignante qui l\u2019avait appel\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il vienne rencontrer le directeur. Selon le directeur, la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait ainsi introduite dans un dossier disciplinaire qui relevait de lui et avait compromis la r\u00e9ussite de son plan d\u2019intervention avec cet \u00e9l\u00e8ve. Il pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019en agissant ainsi la plaignante n\u2019avait pas fait preuve d\u2019un esprit de collaboration. Il ajoute que la plaignante lui aurait manqu\u00e9 de respect. Selon le directeur, l\u2019attitude et le comportement de la plaignante m\u00e9ritaient une r\u00e9primande.\n[86] Lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Kaltush affirme que depuis janvier 2009, elle \u00e9vite le directeur. Elle ajoute qu\u2019il est impoli avec elle, mais elle ne donne aucun exemple pr\u00e9cis pour appuyer cette all\u00e9gation. La plaignante pr\u00e9cise que l\u2019attitude du directeur l\u2019 affecte beaucoup. Encore une fois, elle ne pr\u00e9sente aucune preuve pour \u00e9tayer cette affirmation.\n[87] Le fait que son poste de directrice adjointe a \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli et que l\u2019on ne lui ait pas offert d\u2019emploi pour la prochaine ann\u00e9e est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par elle comme un acte de repr\u00e9sailles. En effet, le 12 juin 2009, soit apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re semaine d\u2019audience, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre de la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole l\u2019informant que son emploi se termine le 15 ao\u00fbt 2009, car le poste de directrice adjointe est aboli. La plaignante ajoute que le directeur lui aurait dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait plus d\u2019emploi pour l\u2019an prochain, mais elle ajoute qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de lettre formelle l\u2019informant de cette d\u00e9cision. Bien que le Tribunal constate que le moment o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 prise d\u2019abolir le poste de directrice adjointe puisse para\u00eetre inappropri\u00e9e, rien ne permet de conclure que cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise comme moyen de repr\u00e9sailles contre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[88] Marcel Rodrigue ne nie pas avoir \u00e9crit la lettre du 12 juin. Selon lui, chaque membre du personnel qui avait indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne revenait pas et ceux dont les contrats se terminaient ont re\u00e7u, en juin, une lettre leur indiquant que leur emploi prendrait fin au mois d\u2019ao\u00fbt. Puisque le poste de directrice adjointe avait \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli, M. Rodrigue en a avis\u00e9 Mme Kaltush en ajoutant qu\u2019elle pouvait avoir un poste d\u2019enseignante pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. La plaignante lui aurait alors r\u00e9pondu, premi\u00e8rement, qu\u2019elle n\u2019accepterait pas de postes avec les \u00e9l\u00e8ves, pour finalement changer d\u2019id\u00e9e. Marcel Rodrigue lui aurait alors dit qu\u2019il transmettrait son nom au nouveau directeur.\n[89] La situation d\u00e9crite par la plaignante a beaucoup plus \u00e0 voir avec des probl\u00e8mes interpersonnels et de communication avec son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat qu\u2019\u00e0 des actes de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle a d\u2019ailleurs t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ni le directeur, ni le conseil de bande n\u2019ont jamais fait mention de sa plainte dans leurs discussions avec elle. De plus, Mme Kaltush ajoute qu\u2019elle ne sait pas si le directeur \u00e9tait au courant qu\u2019elle avait port\u00e9 plainte, car il ne lui en a jamais parl\u00e9.\n(iii) Sylvie Malec [90] Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de la plaignante, Sylvie Malec, portent essentiellement sur le fait que la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole refuse de lui allouer du temps de planification et de pr\u00e9paration pour ses cours de langue innue. Selon elle, lorsqu\u2019on enseigne la langue innue, il devrait y avoir du temps pour la planification d\u2019inclus dans la t\u00e2che de l\u2019enseignante. Elle ajoute que dans la langue innue, l\u2019enseignante n\u2019a pas de programme pr\u00e9d\u00e9termin\u00e9 comme c\u2019est le cas pour les cours de base tels le fran\u00e7ais et l\u2019anglais. Les professeurs de ces cours ont acc\u00e8s \u00e0 du mat\u00e9riel p\u00e9dagogique qui n\u2019existe pas dans le cas de l\u2019enseignement d\u2019une langue autochtone.\n[91] Elle dit que pour elle, enseigner la langue innue \u00e0 tous les niveaux scolaires est une surcharge. Elle ajoute en avoir fait part au directeur, Marcel Rodrigue, qui lui aurait alors r\u00e9pondu : Tu prends ou tu ne prends pas et tu prends la porte.\n[92] Bien que je puisse sympathiser avec la situation de Mme Malec, il m\u2019est impossible de conclure de la preuve soumise que ce d\u00e9saccord entre la direction et la plaignante peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme des actes de repr\u00e9sailles en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[93] D\u2019ailleurs, selon son t\u00e9moignage, la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole n\u2019aurait jamais fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa plainte lors de leurs discussions.\nC. Conclusion concernant les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles [94] Le Tribunal conclut que les plaignantes, \u00c9velyne Malec, Estelle Kaltush et Sylvie Malec n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[95] Le Tribunal estime que la situation d\u00e9crite et la preuve produite par les plaignantes n\u2019appuient pas les all\u00e9gations que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur endroit des repr\u00e9sailles suite au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi. Le Tribunal constate que les plaignantes ne semblent pas placer en contexte les comportements ou les d\u00e9cisions prises par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ses repr\u00e9sentants et qui sont per\u00e7ues par elles comme \u00e9tant des repr\u00e9sailles. Elles d\u00e9crivent, par exemple, des mesures disciplinaires que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a prises \u00e0 partir de l\u2019automne 2008 pour soutenir leurs all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. Bien qu\u2019il se puisse qu\u2019une employ\u00e9e dans la situation des plaignantes ait pu contester avec succ\u00e8s l\u2019imposition de telles mesures dans une proc\u00e9dure judiciaire ou d\u2019arbitrage, le Tribunal tient \u00e0 rappeler qu\u2019il n\u2019agit pas comme arbitre en relations de travail.\n[96] Rien dans la preuve ne permet de conclure que les mesures disciplinaires ou autres actes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9s ou faits en raison du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte ou qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9s par l\u2019intention de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[97] Il est clair que depuis de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, les relations entre les plaignantes et la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun sont difficiles et tendues. Il semble \u00e9galement clair que ces probl\u00e8mes se sont compliqu\u00e9s lors de la mise sous tutelle de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019obligation que cette situation lui imposait de mettre de l\u2019ordre dans ses finances notamment dans le secteur de l\u2019\u00e9ducation. Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est possible que les conflits entre les plaignantes et la direction de l\u2019\u00e9cole aient fait en sorte qu\u2019elles aient per\u00e7u certaines actions de la direction, accomplies dans l\u2019exercice de son droit de g\u00e9rance, comme des actes de repr\u00e9sailles, sans qu\u2019ils en soient l\u00e9galement ainsi.\n[98] Cons\u00e9quemment, les all\u00e9gations que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre les plaignantes en contravention de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi sont rejet\u00e9es.\nIII. L\u2019article 67 de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne [99] Au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, le 21 avril 2007, l\u2019article 67 de Loi, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 abrog\u00e9 en 2008, (voir Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne L.C. 2008, ch. 30) \u00e9tait toujours en vigueur. L\u2019article 67 pr\u00e9voyait :\n67. Nothing in this Act affects any provision of the Indian Act or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act.\n67. La pr\u00e9sente loi est sans effet sur la Loi sur les Indiens et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.\n[100] Le libell\u00e9 de cette disposition est clair et concis. Le but du l\u00e9gislateur en l\u2019adoptant \u00e9tait d\u2019emp\u00eacher que les dispositions de la Loi n\u2019entrent en conflit avec l\u2019application de la Loi sur les Indiens. (Voir : Prince c. Minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada (1994, 25 C.H.R.R. D\/386, (C.F.), aux paras. 23-24). Cet article ne doit pas cependant \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme exon\u00e9rant toutes les d\u00e9cisions des conseils de bande, mais plut\u00f4t comme exon\u00e9rant que les d\u00e9cisions autoris\u00e9es par la Loi sur les Indiens. (Voir Ennis c. Premi\u00e8re Nation de Tobique, 2006 TCDP 21, au par.18).\n[101] Dans Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Conseil de la Bande Gordon, [2001] 1 C.F. 124 (C.A.), la Cour a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019article 67 de la Loi doit s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter restrictivement parce qu\u2019il restreint l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la Cour a invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat Zurich Insurance Company c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [1992] 2 R.C.S. 321, page 339, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a accord\u00e9 au Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario un statut quasi constitutionnel, de telle sorte que les exceptions \u00e0 une telle loi doivent s\u2019interpr\u00e9ter restrictivement.\n[102] Prenant acte de l\u2019article 67, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a invit\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9clarer que la Loi est sans effet sur la politique de ressources humaines adopt\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun et que la plainte doit par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[103] Plusieurs d\u00e9cisions ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019article 67 de la Loi. Afin de comprendre la port\u00e9e de cette disposition, nous allons faire un bref survol des principes qui se d\u00e9gagent de cette jurisprudence. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Desjarlais c. Piapot Band No. 7, [1989] 3 F.C. 605, \u00e0 la page 608 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019expression [\u2026] or any provisions made under or pursuant to that Act [en fran\u00e7ais, et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi.] de l\u2019article 67. Dans cette affaire, le conseil de bande avait adopt\u00e9 une motion cong\u00e9diant une employ\u00e9e. Cette employ\u00e9e a, par la suite, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte all\u00e9guant qu\u2019elle avait fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. L\u2019intim\u00e9 all\u00e9guait que la Commission n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour \u00eatre saisi de l\u2019affaire en raison de l\u2019article 67 [(qui \u00e9tait alors le paragraphe 63(2))] de la Loi. En interpr\u00e9tant cette disposition, le juge Desjardins avait ceci \u00e0 dire :\n11. Le mot affects de la version anglaise a certes une tr\u00e8s large port\u00e9e. Je consid\u00e8re qu'il signifie [Traduction] Agir sur ou avoir un effet sur. \u2026 Le mot effet de la version fran\u00e7aise poss\u00e8de \u00e9galement un caract\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et il \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 des termes tels cons\u00e9quence ou influence. Ainsi lirions-nous: La pr\u00e9sente loi est sans cons\u00e9quence, sans influence sur.\n12. Le mot provision du membre de phrase any provision of the Indian Act (la Loi sur les Indiens) renvoie par connotation \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation, pour faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la fois \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens et aux r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s en vertu de cette Loi. Cette interpr\u00e9tation se trouve confirm\u00e9e par la version fran\u00e7aise.\n13. Le mot provision du membre de phrase or any provision made under or pursuant to [the Indian Act] (et sur les dispositions prises en vertu de cette loi) ne peut avoir la m\u00eame signification que le premier provision, et il ne peut renvoyer exclusivement \u00e0 une disposition l\u00e9gislative d'application g\u00e9n\u00e9rale ainsi que le pr\u00e9tend l'avocat de la Commission. La version fran\u00e7aise rend une telle interpr\u00e9tation impossible. Le mot dispositions de cette version pourrait avoir le sens de mesures l\u00e9gislatives, mais il connote \u00e9galement les notions de d\u00e9cisions et de mesures6, dont la compr\u00e9hension est tr\u00e8s grande. Ainsi les termes or any provision made under or pursuant to that Act [page609] d\u00e9signent-ils plus que les seules stipulations \u00e0 caract\u00e8re l\u00e9gal. J'interpr\u00e8te ces mots comme s'\u00e9tendant \u00e0 toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[104] Dans cette affaire, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9ral s'interrogeait sur la mani\u00e8re dont les bandes indiennes pouvaient prendre des d\u00e9cisions de nature juridique. Le juge Desjardins a estim\u00e9 que, quelle que soit la mani\u00e8re dont la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait prise, toute d\u00e9cision prise par un conseil de bande en vertu d'une disposition pr\u00e9cise de la Loi sur les Indiens serait prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens et que c\u2019est seulement dans ce cas que la Loi serait sans effet.\n[105] L\u2019application de l\u2019article 67 aux d\u00e9cisions prises par un conseil de bande a \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9e par le juge Rothstein (tel \u00e9tait alors son titre) dans l\u2019affaire Bande indienne de Shubenacadie c. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne [1998] 2 C.F. 198 ; confirm\u00e9 dans [2000] A.C.F. n\u00b0 702. Dans cette affaire le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne avait conclu que le chef et le conseil de bande avaient exerc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019endroit des plaignants une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial en refusant de verser des prestations d\u2019aide sociale \u00e0 des conjoints non indiens des membres de bandes indiennes. Au paragraphe 31, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise :\nJe ne crois pas que la d\u00e9cision dont il s'agit en l'esp\u00e8ce soit une d\u00e9cision vis\u00e9e par l'article 67 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Il ne fait aucun doute qu'une d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par le conseil de bande, et il se peut fort bien qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu du R\u00e8glement sur le mode de proc\u00e9dure au conseil des bandes d'Indiens, mais aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve ne laisse entendre que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en vertu d'une disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens. Indubitablement, l'article 67 reconna\u00eet que certaines dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens et de ses r\u00e8glements peuvent \u00eatre en conflit avec la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne et, dans un tel cas, la Loi sur les Indiens et son R\u00e8glement auront pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance, mais je ne crois pas que l'on puisse dire que l'article 67 enl\u00e8ve du champ de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par les conseils des bandes indiennes dans la mesure o\u00f9 elles sont prises en vertu du R\u00e8glement sur le mode de proc\u00e9dure au conseil des bandes d'Indiens. Si le l\u00e9gislateur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral avait voulu soustraire toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par les conseils des bandes indiennes au contr\u00f4le de la Commission des droits de la personne, il l'aurait express\u00e9ment pr\u00e9vu au lieu d'\u00e9dicter l'article 67. L'article 67 prot\u00e8ge les d\u00e9cisions autoris\u00e9es par la Loi sur les Indiens et par son R\u00e8glement, mais non toutes les d\u00e9cisions prises par les conseils des bandes indiennes. Je crois que cette conclusion s'accorde avec les remarques incidentes de l'arr\u00eat Desjarlais (Re). L'article 67 ne vient donc pas en aide au requ\u00e9rant.\n[106] La d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire Bande indienne de Shubenacadie, fut suivie par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Bernard c. Conseil scolaire de Waycobah (1999), 36 C.H.R.R. D\/51, dans lequel le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 un argument fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019article 67 en affirmant que, bien que le paragraphe 114(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens autorise le ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, diriger et entretenir des \u00e9coles pour les enfants indiens, il est difficile d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien r\u00e9el entre ce paragraphe de la Loi sur les Indiens et la d\u00e9cision du conseil scolaire de Waycobah de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de secr\u00e9taire de l\u2019\u00e9cole. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas l\u00e0 selon le Tribunal d\u2019une d\u00e9cision prise en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[107] Dans Bressette c. Conseil de Bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation Kettle et Stoney Point (n\u00b0 1), 2003 TCDP 41, il \u00e9tait question d\u2019un Indien inscrit membre de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stoney Point qui a pos\u00e9 sa candidature, sans succ\u00e8s, pour le poste d\u2019intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. Celui-ci a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, car il pr\u00e9tendait ne pas avoir obtenu le poste en raison de sa situation familiale. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9tendu que sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait express\u00e9ment autoris\u00e9e par les articles 69, 81 et 83 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Les articles 81 et 83 autorisent les conseils de bande \u00e0 prendre des r\u00e8glements pour les fins mentionn\u00e9es dans ces articles. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 deux r\u00e8glements adopt\u00e9s en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. Le Tribunal a conclu que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 comportait \u00e0 la fois un aspect de dotation en personnel et \u00e0 la fois un aspect financier. Mais l\u2019objet principal de la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande \u00e9tait de remplir le poste d\u2019intervenant aupr\u00e8s des familles. La Loi sur les Indiens ne comprend aucune disposition pr\u00e9cise qui traite de la dotation en personnel dans une bande. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019article 67 ne s\u2019appliquait pas.\n[108] Parmi les causes portant sur l\u2019application de l\u2019article 67 de la Loi cit\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9, trois (Courtois c. Canada (minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord, 1990 CanLII 702 (T.C.D.P.); Prince c. Minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, et Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Conseil de la Bande Gordon, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9) ont conclu que la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande n\u2019\u00e9tait pas soumise au contr\u00f4le en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Dans ces causes, la d\u00e9cision du conseil de bande \u00e9tait soutenue par une disposition pr\u00e9cise de la Loi sur les Indiens. Dans les autres causes o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait soumise au contr\u00f4le de la Loi, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pu mentionner aucune disposition pr\u00e9cise de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9tayant la d\u00e9cision sur laquelle portait la plainte.\n[109] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, nous devons nous demander s\u2019il existe un article sp\u00e9cifique de la Loi sur les Indiens qui permet \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de refuser de verser aux plaignantes la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement. Dans son argumentation, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019article 73 de la Loi sur les Indiens, par lequel le Parlement a d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 une part de ses pouvoirs constitutionnels de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer envers les Indiens et envers les terres r\u00e9serv\u00e9es aux Indiens au Cabinet f\u00e9d\u00e9ral par le biais de la prise de r\u00e8glements f\u00e9d\u00e9raux. Il a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux articles 81, 83 et 85.1, qui traitent de la prise de r\u00e8glements administratifs. Il ajoute enfin que l\u2019exercice des pouvoirs conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 une bande ou \u00e0 un conseil s\u2019exerce par le principe de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation des pouvoirs, laquelle d\u00e9l\u00e9gation des pouvoirs est express\u00e9ment mentionn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 2(3)b) de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[110] Personne en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, y compris les plaignantes, ne conteste le pouvoir de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019adopter des r\u00e8glements administratifs ou des politiques concernant les ressources humaines pour son \u00e9cole. Ce qui est contest\u00e9 c\u2019est la mise en \u0153uvre de cette politique notamment le fait que la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les enseignants, sauf aux enseignantes innues. Aucune disposition de la Loi sur les Indiens n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal pour soutenir que ces primes ne pouvaient \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 des Innues. Cons\u00e9quemment, on ne peut dire que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de ne pas verser aux plaignantes cette prime est un pouvoir qui d\u00e9coule de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[111] L\u2019intim\u00e9 attire \u00e9galement l\u2019attention du Tribunal sur la disposition transitoire contenue \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi modifiant la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.C. 2008, ch. 30, qui se lit comme suit :\n3. Despite section 1, an act or omission by any First Nation government, including a band council, tribal council or governing authority operating or administering programs or services under the Indian Act, that was made in the exercise of powers or the performance of duties and functions conferred or imposed by or under the Act shall not constitute the basis for a complaint under Part III of the Canadian Human Rights Act if it occurs within 36 months after the day on which this Act receives royal assent.\n3. Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019article 1, les actes ou omissions du gouvernement d\u2019une premi\u00e8re nation \u2013 y compris un conseil de bande, un conseil tribal ou une autorit\u00e9 gouvernementale qui offre ou administre des programmes ou des services sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi sur les Indiens \u2013 qui sont accomplis dans l\u2019exercice des attributions pr\u00e9vues par cette loi ou sons son r\u00e9gime ne peuvent servir de fondement ;a une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la Partie III de la Loi canadienne des droits de la personne s\u2019ils sont accomplis dans les trente-six mois suivant la date de sanction de la pr\u00e9sente loi.\n[112] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cette disposition offre un \u00e9clairage nouveau de la port\u00e9e interpr\u00e9tative que devait avoir l\u2019article 67 de la Loi. Il pr\u00e9tend que cette disposition vient \u00e9tablir l\u2019\u00e9tendue de la protection offerte au Conseil de bande par l\u2019ancienne disposition et que toute d\u00e9cision jurisprudentielle ant\u00e9rieure doit \u00eatre maintenant clairement distingu\u00e9e en raison de la port\u00e9e \u00e9tendue que conf\u00e8re ce nouvel article \u00e0 l\u2019ancien article 67.\n[113] Le Tribunal n\u2019accepte pas cet argument. Le seul effet de l\u2019article 3 est d\u2019offrir une p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce de trente-six mois et toute tentative de voir dans celui-ci un rejet des d\u00e9cisions qui ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019article 67 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour est illogique. Si tel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur, il l\u2019aurait exprim\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re plus claire et non simplement dans une disposition offrant une p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce.\n[114] Cons\u00e9quemment, l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal est rejet\u00e9e.\nIV. Redressements [115] Les redressements sollicit\u00e9s par les plaignantes sont les suivants :\nle versement de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement ; une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi; et une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en conformit\u00e9 avec le par. 53(3) de la Loi.\nA. La prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement [116] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\n53(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n[\u2026]\n(b) that the person make available to the victim of the discriminatory practice, on the first reasonable occasion, the rights, opportunities or privileges that are being or were denied the victim as a result of the practice;\n53(2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\n[\u2026]\nb) d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l\u2019acte l\u2019a priv\u00e9e;\n[117] Consid\u00e9rant, les conclusions du Tribunal les plaignantes auraient donc droit, pour les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 2007, au versement de la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement dont l\u2019acte de discrimination de l\u2019intim\u00e9 les a priv\u00e9s.\n[118] La politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vigueur avant 2007 pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019enseignant qui d\u00e9tient au minimum un baccalaur\u00e9at et le personnel professionnel ayant la m\u00eame scolarit\u00e9 ont droit \u00e0 une prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement. Le taux de la prime variera selon que l\u2019enseignant a des enfants \u00e0 charge ($6 000), ou qu\u2019il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 sans enfant \u00e0 charge (3 000 $). Elle pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que si deux employ\u00e9s sont mari\u00e9s ou sont des conjoints de fait, un seul des deux pourra r\u00e9clamer la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement pour enfant \u00e0 charge et l\u2019autre employ\u00e9(e) b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiera de la prime d\u2019employ\u00e9 sans enfant \u00e0 charge.\n[119] Pour d\u00e9terminer le montant de prime auquel les plaignantes ont droit, nous devons donc aborder chaque cas de mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendante :\n\u00c9velyne Malec \u2013 Cette plaignante d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en \u00e9ducation. Elle a deux enfants \u00e0 charge. Cependant, puisque son conjoint recevait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2007, une prime de 6 000 $ par ann\u00e9e, elle n\u2019aurait droit pour la p\u00e9riode du d\u00e9but de son emploi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2007 qu\u2019\u00e0 une prime annuelle de 3 000 $. La preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement qu\u2019il faut d\u00e9duire de ce montant la prime qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7ue de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004, ann\u00e9e durant laquelle elle n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun. Anne Bellefleur-Tettaut \u2013 Elle ne d\u00e9tient pas de baccalaur\u00e9at, mais elle poss\u00e8de, selon la preuve, un certificat en \u00e9ducation et un permis d\u2019enseignement. Mme Bellefleur-Tettaut a enseign\u00e9 la langue innue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole de 1983 \u00e0 2007. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune universit\u00e9 n\u2019offre de baccalaur\u00e9at pour l\u2019enseignement de langue autochtone. Cette preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Bien que techniquement on puisse dire qu\u2019elle ne satisfait pas le premier crit\u00e8re de la politique pour l\u2019obtention de la prime, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et les qualifications \u00e9quivalentes \u00e0 celles d\u2019un enseignant d\u00e9tenant un baccalaur\u00e9at. Ainsi, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019elle devrait avoir droit \u00e0 la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement pour la p\u00e9riode entre les ann\u00e9es 1990 (date o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9cole est tomb\u00e9e sous la comp\u00e9tence de l\u2019intim\u00e9) et 2007, date o\u00f9 elle a pris sa retraite, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004 o\u00f9 elle n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9. La plaignante a trois enfants qui aujourd\u2019hui ont tous atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge adulte, le plus vieux ayant 33 ans et le cadet 25 ans. Lorsqu\u2019elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 en 1990, les trois enfants \u00e9taient mineurs, le cadet ayant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque 6 ans. Le Tribunal peut donc d\u00e9duire que pendant 12 de ses 17 ann\u00e9es au cours desquelles elle \u00e9tait assujettie \u00e0 la politique, elle avait des enfants \u00e0 charge. Pour ces 12 ann\u00e9es, elle a donc droit \u00e0 la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement annuelle de 6 000 $. Pour les cinq (5) ann\u00e9es restantes, elle a droit au montant de 3 000 $, par ann\u00e9e. Estelle Kaltush \u2013 Elle d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at en enseignement. Depuis 1990, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de quatre ann\u00e9es, elle a toujours enseign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun. Elle a deux enfants : une fille de 30 ans et une deuxi\u00e8me qui vient de terminer son CEGEP. Mme Kaltush a droit \u00e0 une prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement de 6 000 $, pour couvrir la p\u00e9riode de 1990 \u00e0 2007, puisque pendant ces ann\u00e9es elle avait des enfants \u00e0 charge. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pourra cependant d\u00e9duire quatre ann\u00e9es de ce montant puisque, selon la preuve, Mme Kaltush n\u2019aurait pas travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 pendant ces ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 elle dit avoir pris un sabbatique. Anna Malec - Elle d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at et travaille pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 depuis 1990. Selon la preuve, elle avait des enfants \u00e0 charge pendant toute la p\u00e9riode en question et elle a donc droit \u00e0 la prime annuelle de 6 000 $, par ann\u00e9e pour les ann\u00e9es 1990 \u00e0 2007, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004 Marceline Kaltush \u2013 Elle d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at et travaille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole depuis 1990. Bien qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas d\u2019enfants, elle dit avoir \u00e0 charge son neveu et sa ni\u00e8ce. Le gar\u00e7on a actuellement 19 ans et la fille de 17 ans. Son neveu est \u00e0 sa charge depuis qu\u2019il a 4 ans. La fille est venue habiter chez elle en 2001. Cette preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Puisqu\u2019elle a des enfants \u00e0 charge, elle a droit \u00e0 la prime annuelle de 6 000 $ pour ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019enseignement pour les ann\u00e9es de 1994\u00e0 2007, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de 2003-2004. Sylvie Malec \u2013 Elle enseigne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Uauitshitun depuis janvier 2003, sauf pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004. Elle ne d\u00e9tient pas de baccalaur\u00e9at, mais pour les m\u00eames raisons que Anne Bellefleur-Tettaut, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019elle a droit \u00e0 la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement. Mme Malec a des enfants \u00e0 charge et \u00e0 donc droit \u00e0 la prime annuelle de 6 000 $, pour ses ann\u00e9es d\u2019enseignement jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2007. Monique Ishpatao \u2013 Elle d\u00e9tient un baccalaur\u00e9at. Elle enseigne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole depuis 1990. Elle n\u2019a pas d\u2019enfant \u00e0 charge et a donc droit \u00e0 la prime d\u2019\u00e9loignement de 3 000 $, par ann\u00e9e, pour les ann\u00e9es 1990 \u00e0 2007 \u00e0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2003-2004.\n[120] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la Loi, les plaignantes, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de Germaine Mest\u00e9nap\u00e9ao pour laquelle aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, ont donc droit aux avantages qui sont d\u00e9crits aux paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nB. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral \u2013 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi [121] Les plaignantes demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9es pour le pr\u00e9judice moral qu\u2019elles ont subi en raison de l\u2019acte discriminatoire en conformit\u00e9 avec l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2) e) de la Loi. Je ne crois pas qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 importante soit opportune en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Les plaignantes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 leur estime de soi. \u00c0 mon avis, la preuve d\u00e9montre que cela n\u2019a eu que de modestes effets sur elles. Dans ces circonstances, il est justifi\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner le paiement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 500 $ \u00e0 chacune des plaignantes, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de Germaine Mest\u00e9nap\u00e9ao, pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\nC. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u2013 paragraphe 53(3). [122] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner le paiement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00e0 la victime si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis des actes d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a-t-il agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e ? C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, \u00e9tait-il conscient du risque que sa conduite discriminatoire puisse \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e et qu\u2019il ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der malgr\u00e9 tout ? Selon moi, la preuve n\u2019\u00e9taye pas cette proposition. La d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de traiter les plaignantes diff\u00e9remment des autres enseignants \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre peu judicieuse, mais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, \u00e0 mon avis, inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e au sens du paragraphe 53(3).\n[123] La demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignantes en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMichel Doucet Membre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 27 janvier 2010\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1318\/4808\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Evelyne Malec, Sylvie Malec, Marcelline Kaltush, Monique Ishpatao, Anne B.

La plainte [1] La pr\u00e9sente plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 23 avril 2004 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu des alin\u00e9as 7b) et 10a) et b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] La plaignante (Mme Johnstone) soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e (l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (l\u2019ASFC)) a us\u00e9 de pratiques discriminatoires fond\u00e9es sur la situation de famille en cours d\u2019emploi. Le paragraphe 3(1) de la LCDP \u00e9tablit la situation de famille comme motif de distinction illicite.\n[3] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP est ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9 :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\nb) de [...] d\u00e9favoriser [un individu] en cours d\u2019emploi [1976-77, ch. 33, art. 7.]\n[4] Les alin\u00e9as 10a) et b) de la LCDP sont ainsi r\u00e9dig\u00e9s :\nConstitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite et s\u2019il est susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, le fait, pour l\u2019employeur, l\u2019association patronale ou l\u2019organisation syndicale :\nde fixer ou d\u2019appliquer des lignes de conduite; de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d\u2019un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel. [L.R. (1985), ch. H\u20116, art. 10; 1998, ch. 9, art. 13(E).]\n[5] Les pratiques \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la plainte sont le d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation ainsi que la diff\u00e9rence pr\u00e9judiciable de traitement fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, soit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce le fait d\u2019\u00e9lever deux jeunes enfants. Selon les conclusions de la d\u00e9cision Moore c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 31, au paragraphe 86 le d\u00e9faut de prendre une mesure d\u2019adaptation n\u2019est pas une pratique discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP, parce que [e]n vertu de cette derni\u00e8re, il n\u2019existe pas de droit d\u2019adaptation distinct.\n[6] La pratique discriminatoire contre la plaignante aurait d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 2004. Bien que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des deux parties traitent principalement de la p\u00e9riode allant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 2007 inclusivement, la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce mentionne que la discrimination est [Traduction] continue. Mme Johnstone a soutenu \u00e0 l\u2019audience que la discrimination dont elle se plaint \u00e9tait une [Traduction] une pratique continue et qu\u2019elle se poursuivait toujours. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP) a appuy\u00e9 cette approche.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation de preuves portant sur la p\u00e9riode suivant 2007, parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019all\u00e9gations [Traduction] post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la plainte, et que de tels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve seraient trop \u00e9loign\u00e9s dans le temps en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la pertinence. La plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 23 avril 2004.\n[8] Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 le point de vue de la plaignante et de la CCDP au sujet du fait que la plainte est continue et a not\u00e9 que la plainte \u00e9crite pr\u00e9sentait d\u00e9j\u00e0 cet argument. Les all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP traitent aussi du fait que le comportement contest\u00e9 \u00e9tait de nature syst\u00e9mique et les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es refl\u00e8tent cette position.\n[9] Toutes les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves au sujet des pratiques de l\u2019ASFC, des politiques \u00e9crites et non \u00e9crites et l\u2019ASFC, de la convention collective pertinente modifi\u00e9e au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte, de l\u2019Entente sur les postes \u00e0 horaires variables (l\u2019EPHV) en place \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la plainte et modifi\u00e9e par la suite, ainsi que des cons\u00e9quences, tant pass\u00e9es que pr\u00e9sentes, de l\u2019application de ces pratiques, politiques et ententes.\n[10] Mme Johnstone soutient que les politiques de l\u2019ASFC l\u2019ont forc\u00e9e \u00e0 accepter un statut \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 son retour au travail apr\u00e8s un cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 pour chacun de ses deux enfants, l\u2019obligeant ainsi \u00e0 travailler moins que le nombre d\u2019heures qu\u2019elle pouvait et voulait travailler, entra\u00eenant ainsi une perte d\u2019avantages qui sont offerts aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein, y compris des avantages pr\u00e9vus par sa convention collective et son droit \u00e0 pension en vertu de la Loi sur la pension de la fonction publique.\n[11] La plaignante et l\u2019ASFC \u00e9taient toutes deux repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par leurs avocats \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La CCDP \u00e9tait aussi repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat, mais n\u2019a trait\u00e9 que des arguments soulev\u00e9s en lien avec l\u2019article 10 dans la plainte. Le fait que des avocats ont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 toutes les parties a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s avantageux pour le Tribunal.\n[12] Avant l\u2019audience, l\u2019ASFC a tent\u00e9 de faire ajouter le syndicat comme partie. L\u2019une des raisons principales que l\u2019ASFC a donn\u00e9es pour l\u2019ajout du syndicat \u00e9tait que l\u2019EPHV emp\u00eachait l\u2019ASFC d\u2019examiner la demande de Mme Johnstone au sujet de quarts fixes qui lui donneraient des heures \u00e0 temps complet sur seulement trois jours par semaine. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cet argument \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[13] Mme Johnstone et la CCDP ont contest\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate au motif qu\u2019aucune des r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par Mme Johnstone n\u2019exigeait la modification de la convention collective en cours ni de l\u2019EPHV. Le syndicat a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un affidavit au Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la plaignante, mais n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 activement. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate au motif que la participation du syndicat \u00e0 l\u2019audience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour la pr\u00e9sentation de preuves pertinentes ni pour la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal de trancher les questions soulev\u00e9es. La requ\u00eate a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e tard au cours du processus et que la participation du syndicat n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher correctement la partie de la plainte sur la responsabilit\u00e9 [voir 2009 TCDP 14].\nII. Le contexte factuel [14] Mme Johnstone est une agente des services frontaliers du Canada (ASF). Elle est employ\u00e9e de l\u2019ASFC depuis le 14 avril 1998. Elle est pr\u00e9sentement en cong\u00e9 sans solde, au sujet duquel des pr\u00e9cisions seront apport\u00e9es plus tard dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la plainte, elle travaillait pour les Op\u00e9rations des passagers au terminal de l\u2019a\u00e9roport Pearson (le TAP) \u00e0 Toronto, au Canada.\n[15] De l\u2019avis g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Mme Johnstone est une employ\u00e9e exemplaire qui d\u00e9passe souvent les attentes de ses sup\u00e9rieurs et qui a re\u00e7u des \u00e9valuations \u00e9logieuses pour sa diligence, ses excellents r\u00e9sultats et sa rigueur dans ses t\u00e2ches.\n[16] Mme Johnstone est mari\u00e9e \u00e0 Jason Noble (Jason) depuis d\u00e9cembre 2002. Jason est aussi un AFC. Au d\u00e9but de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte, Jason travaillait pour l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 titre de superviseur, aussi au TAP. Il travaille maintenant \u00e0 Ottawa.\n[17] Mme Johnstone et son mari ont deux enfants. L\u2019a\u00een\u00e9 est n\u00e9 en janvier 2003 et Mme Johnstone est retourn\u00e9e travailler le 4 janvier 2004. Le deuxi\u00e8me enfant est n\u00e9 en d\u00e9cembre 2004 et Mme Johnstone est retourn\u00e9e travailler le 26 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Les deux enfants seront d\u2019\u00e2ge scolaire en 2010.\n[18] Le TAP fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine. Pour couvrir les exigences op\u00e9rationnelles de ce milieu de travail, la convention collective est fond\u00e9e sur un plan de quarts de travail par rotation nomm\u00e9 EPHV, un acronyme signifiant Entente sur les postes \u00e0 horaires variables. D\u00e8s que Mme Johnstone a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour l\u2019ASFC, apr\u00e8s une courte p\u00e9riode de travail \u00e0 temps partiel, elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein dans un horaire de cinq jours de travail, trois jours de cong\u00e9, par quarts rotatifs gouvern\u00e9s par l\u2019EPHV.\n[19] En plus des rotations, les quarts de travail sont irr\u00e9guliers et impr\u00e9visibles. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les faits vis\u00e9s par la plainte ont eu lieu, les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein suivaient une rotation compos\u00e9e de six heures de d\u00e9but diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9parties au cours de la journ\u00e9e, de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi et de la soir\u00e9e, sans mod\u00e8le pr\u00e9visible. De plus, les employ\u00e9s travaillaient diff\u00e9rents jours pendant la semaine pour toute la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019horaire. Cet horaire comptait 56 jours. Les ASF \u00e9taient avis\u00e9s 15 jours avant le d\u00e9but de chaque nouvel horaire. L\u2019employeur pouvait changer l\u2019horaire \u00e0 cinq jours de pr\u00e9avis.\n[20] Dans le contexte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, un poste \u00e0 temps plein au sens de l\u2019article 25.13 de la convention collective en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque comptait 37,5 heures r\u00e9guli\u00e8res par semaine, en fonction d\u2019une journ\u00e9e de 8 heures qui comptait une pause-repas d\u2019une demi-heure non pay\u00e9e. Tout employ\u00e9 qui travaillait moins de 37,5 heures par semaine \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Tout employ\u00e9 qui travaillait plus de 37,5 heures par semaine \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 au tarif des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[21] Les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires sont obligatoires pour un ASF. Le besoin d\u2019effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires est souvent impr\u00e9visible parce qu\u2019il peut d\u00e9couler de t\u00e2ches \u00e0 tout moments dans des circonstances particuli\u00e8res qui ne peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9vues, par exemple la d\u00e9tention de biens ou de personnes. Parfois, les employ\u00e9s savent \u00e0 l\u2019avance qu\u2019ils devront faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, ou la direction les appelle pour qu\u2019ils travaillent en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison des besoins du milieu de travail, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[22] Jason travaillait aussi \u00e0 temps plein dans un horaire r\u00e9gulier de quarts de travail rotatifs gouvern\u00e9s par l\u2019EPHV et il travaillait un quart de travail suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 10 h. En raison de ses t\u00e2ches de supervision, il devait aussi parfois participer \u00e0 des r\u00e9unions et \u00e0 des s\u00e9ances de formation lors de ses jours de cong\u00e9 et voyager \u00e0 d\u2019autres points d\u2019entr\u00e9e pendant des moyens de pression.\n[23] De 2002 \u00e0 2004, tant avant que Mme Johnstone parte pour son premier cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s son retour, elle a demand\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019adaptation de la part de l\u2019ASFC en raison de ses nouvelles responsabilit\u00e9s de m\u00e8re. Elle a demand\u00e9 les m\u00eames mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 son retour au travail apr\u00e8s son deuxi\u00e8me cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Dans les deux cas, elle a eu \u00e0 composer avec une politique non \u00e9crite de l\u2019ASFC qui refuse d\u2019accorder un horaire \u00e0 temps plein aux personnes qui demandent des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour \u00e9lever leurs enfants.\n[24] Avant la fin de son premier cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, Mme Johnstone avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC de lui accorder des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein. Mme Johnstone souhaitait travailler trois jours par semaine, \u00e0 raison de 13 heures par jour, afin de pouvoir garder son statut d\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein. Un quart de travail de 13 heures aurait compris une pause-repas d\u2019une demi-heure non pay\u00e9e. Elle n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 d\u2019heure de d\u00e9but. Lorsque l\u2019ASFC lui a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait impossible, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une autre demande d\u2019horaire \u00e0 trois jours par semaine, \u00e0 raison de 12 heures par jour. Bien qu\u2019elle reconnut que ce deuxi\u00e8me horaire \u00e9tait \u00e0 temps partiel, elle tentait de maximiser ses heures de travail afin qu\u2019il y ait le moins d\u2019effets n\u00e9gatifs possibles sur sa pension et ses avantages sociaux.\n[25] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler sur une p\u00e9riode de trois jours \u00e9tait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait des seuls trois jours par semaine au cours desquels elle pouvait obtenir des services de garde \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le pour ses enfants. Trois des membres de sa famille \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 s\u2019occuper de l\u2019enfant, puis de ses enfants, \u00e0 raison d\u2019une journ\u00e9e chacun. Elle n\u2019avait pas d\u2019aide de sa famille pour une quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e.\n[26] Mme Johnstone a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des services de garderie offerts par des tiers, mais qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le faire en raison des difficult\u00e9s que pr\u00e9sentait un horaire \u00e0 quarts de travail rotatifs. Elle n\u2019a pas eu plus de succ\u00e8s \u00e0 trouver un service de garde pour un horaire \u00e0 quarts de travail fixes qui allait au\u2011del\u00e0 des heures normales d\u2019ouverture d\u2019une garderie et qui pouvait \u00eatre prolong\u00e9 sans pr\u00e9avis en raison d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[27] Mme Johnstone a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souhaitait continuer \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein afin que son droit \u00e0 pension, son salaire et les occasions de promotion ne soient pas affect\u00e9s.\n[28] L\u2019ASFC \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour Mme Johnstone, mais seulement pour des quarts fixes de trois jours par semaine \u00e0 raison de 10 heures par jour, en plus d\u2019une quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e de quatre heures.\n[29] En plus de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, Mme Johnstone a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 des m\u00e9thodes \u00e0 son employeur qui lui permettraient de garder sa pension au niveau temps plein tout en travaillant \u00e0 temps partiel, mais ses suggestions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es. Ce point sera trait\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tails ci\u2011dessous.\n[30] Personne ne conteste le fait que l\u2019ASFC a une politique non \u00e9crite voulant qu\u2019une personne demandant des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour prendre soin de ses enfants puisse obtenir des quarts de travail fixes, mais doive accepter de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel pour un maximum de 34 heures par semaine. Cette politique non \u00e9crite ne permet pas aux employ\u00e9s d\u2019occuper un quart de travail fixe \u00e0 temps plein si cette demande est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en raison de responsabilit\u00e9s parentales.\n[31] Personne ne conteste non plus le fait que l\u2019ASFC prend des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour ses employ\u00e9s pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et religieuses en leur accordant des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein, de temps en temps, pour diff\u00e9rentes p\u00e9riodes et, parfois, de fa\u00e7on permanente. Ces demandes sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es en fonction des besoins individuels et, dans le cas d\u2019adaptation pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, l\u2019ASFC demande une corroboration m\u00e9dicale des raisons de la demande. Il y a aussi eu des cas o\u00f9 des employ\u00e9s ont obtenu des mesures d\u2019adaptation parce qu\u2019ils avaient des enfants avec des besoins m\u00e9dicaux.\n[32] De plus, personne n\u2019a contest\u00e9 le fait que cette politique non \u00e9crite n\u2019est pas appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on uniforme. Certains employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC travaillent \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 raison de 36 heures par semaine, certains employ\u00e9s ont des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein et d\u2019autres ont obtenu la permission \u2013 tout en travaillant \u00e0 temps partiel \u2013 de garder l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019une pension et des avantages sociaux d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein. Bien que deux des t\u00e9moins gestionnaires \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC aient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 vouloir mettre fin \u00e0 ces anomalies, ils ont tous les deux reconnu que ces exceptions existent toujours.\nIII. Les op\u00e9rations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [33] Le mandat de l\u2019ASFC comprend l\u2019inspection et le contr\u00f4le des voyageurs et des biens arrivant au Canada \u00e0 chacun de ses a\u00e9roports et postes-fronti\u00e8re terrestres, 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine.\n[34] L\u2019a\u00e9roport le plus occup\u00e9 est le TAP. Le district des Op\u00e9rations des passagers, une composante des op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto, supervise ces fonctions au TAP.\n[35] Jusqu\u2019en 1994, les fonctions douani\u00e8res \u00e9taient la responsabilit\u00e9 de Douanes et Accise au sein du minist\u00e8re du Revenu national. Vers 1994 ou 1995, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire de Douanes et Accise un minist\u00e8re en soi, nomm\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re du Revenu national. En novembre 1999, les fonctions de l\u2019ancien minist\u00e8re ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 une nouvelle agence nomm\u00e9e Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ADRC).\n[36] Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, par d\u00e9cret f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, les responsabilit\u00e9s douani\u00e8res de l\u2019ADRC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es \u00e0 un nouvel organisme d\u2019\u00c9tat nomm\u00e9 l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada. Cette agence a aussi absorb\u00e9 la composante des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e (Bureau int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Immigration) qui revenait auparavant au minist\u00e8re de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration. De plus, l\u2019ASFC est aussi devenue responsable de la r\u00e9glementation de l\u2019entr\u00e9e de nourriture, de plantes et d\u2019animaux, inspections qui \u00e9taient effectu\u00e9es auparavant par l\u2019Agence canadienne de l\u2019inspection des aliments.\n[37] La date du 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e (et a pris les responsabilit\u00e9s en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce), a gagn\u00e9 en pertinence \u00e0 mesure que la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, quant \u00e0 son lien avec la [Traduction] v\u00e9rification de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi de l\u2019ADRC, preuve exhaustive, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la CCDP le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003. Cette question est reprise plus en d\u00e9tails ci\u2011dessous.\n[38] Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019ADRC en 1999, l\u2019employeur de la plaignante \u00e9tait le Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (SCT). En vertu de sa loi habilitante, l\u2019ADRC, maintenant l\u2019ARC, est un employeur distinct. Lorsque le transfert des fonctions douani\u00e8res de l\u2019ADRC \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC a eu lieu le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003, le SCT est redevenu l\u2019employeur de la plaignante.\n[39] Les Op\u00e9rations des passagers sont pr\u00e9sentement l\u2019un des trois districts principaux op\u00e9rationnels de l\u2019ASFC dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Les deux autres districts sont les Op\u00e9rations commerciales et le Centre d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi du Grand Toronto (CELGT). Le CELGT n\u2019emploie pas d\u2019ASF. En plus de ces trois districts, la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto poss\u00e8de un certain nombre d\u2019autres divisions, y compris la Division des enqu\u00eates, la Division du renseignement, la Division de la v\u00e9rification de l\u2019observation, la Division de la planification et de l\u2019int\u00e9gration des programmes et la Division des services corporatifs (Ressources humaines, TI, Finances et Administration).\n[40] De ces districts, seules les Op\u00e9rations des passagers et les Op\u00e9rations commerciales emploient des personnes du groupe et du niveau auxquels les inspecteurs des douanes (ID) (PM\u201102), plus tard nomm\u00e9s ASF (PM\u201103), \u00e9taient classifi\u00e9s en 2004 et par la suite. Le Centre de traitement du courrier international (Gateway) fait maintenant partie des Op\u00e9rations commerciales.\n[41] Le district des Op\u00e9rations commerciales \u00e9tait responsable du fret d\u2019avions commerciaux et des entrep\u00f4ts d\u2019attente [installations pour le d\u00e9barquement, l\u2019entreposage, la mise en lieu s\u00fbr, le transfert, l\u2019inspection, la livraison et l\u2019exp\u00e9dition de biens import\u00e9s avant que l\u2019ASFC en autorise la sortie], de bureaux secondaires des douanes, d\u2019une composante maritime et d\u2019un terminal ferroviaire situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Concord et \u00e0 Brampton. La majeure partie du travail pour ce district est effectu\u00e9e au TAP, de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 des pistes par rapport aux terminaux. Les ASF des Op\u00e9rations commerciales ont des t\u00e2ches au comptoir pour le public et inspectent le fret dans les entrep\u00f4ts afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il faut saisir, retenir ou autoriser la sortie les biens.\n[42] En 2004, Gateway \u00e9tait un district distinct dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Vers 2005 ou 2006, les op\u00e9rations de Gateway ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fusionn\u00e9es au district des Op\u00e9rations commerciales. Le travail des ASF \u00e0 Gateway est de trier et d\u2019inspecter le courrier, les documents et les colis qui arrivent au Canada, alors qu\u2019ils passent sur un tapis m\u00e9canique dans la zone d\u2019examen primaire, puis dans la zone d\u2019examen secondaire. Des documents sont pr\u00e9par\u00e9s pour les envois de grande taille qui sont retenus jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les droits soient pay\u00e9s. Les travailleurs \u00e0 Gateway ont des quarts de travail fixes.\n[43] Le travail des ASF effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 Gateway, aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers et aux Op\u00e9rations commerciales est \u00e9tabli dans une description de travail universelle et tous les employ\u00e9s ont la m\u00eame classification.\n[44] En 2004, les Op\u00e9rations des passagers au TAP \u00e9taient responsables de l\u2019inspection des passagers dans trois terminaux (les terminaux 1, 2 et 3). Les Op\u00e9rations des passagers \u00e9taient aussi responsables de East Hold, un immeuble pr\u00e8s des pistes o\u00f9 de petits avions en vols transfrontaliers arrivent. En 2004, les passagers de ces vols \u00e9taient emmen\u00e9s en autobus jusqu\u2019au terminal 2 pour inspection. Les exploitants de services a\u00e9ronautiques aux a\u00e9roports (les jets priv\u00e9s) arrivant avec des passagers \u00e9taient aussi trait\u00e9s aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers, fonction qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e aux Op\u00e9rations commerciales en 2005.\n[45] En janvier 2007, le terminal 2 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 et les op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 ce terminal ont \u00e9t\u00e9 absorb\u00e9es au terminal 1. Pr\u00e9sentement, les vols avec les \u00c9tats-Unis et les vols internationaux d\u2019Air Canada rel\u00e8vent du terminal 1 et la majorit\u00e9 des autres compagnies a\u00e9riennes sont au terminal 3.\n[46] M. Norm Sheridan a \u00e9t\u00e9 le directeur des Op\u00e9rations des passagers depuis 1999 et durant toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour Revenu Canada \u2013 Douanes et Accise en 1979, o\u00f9 il a occup\u00e9 divers r\u00f4les et responsabilit\u00e9s, y compris, pendant un certain temps, des t\u00e2ches en ressources humaines.\n[47] En 2004, M. Sheridan avait trois chefs (un chef par terminal) qui relevaient de lui. L\u2019un des trois chefs \u00e9tait Rhonda Raby, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction et qui occupait le poste de chef du terminal 1.\n[48] Chaque chef avait entre 9 et 13 surintendants qui \u00e9taient responsables de la gestion quotidienne des terminaux et de la supervision des ASF de leurs \u00e9quipes.\n[49] Les ASF \u00e9taient assign\u00e9s \u00e0 des \u00e9quipes qui travaillaient \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019inspection primaire (le primaire) ou au comptoir secondaire (le secondaire), o\u00f9 ils insepectaient les passagers entrant au Canada. En 2004, chaque \u00e9quipe \u00e9tait compos\u00e9e d\u2019environ 8 employ\u00e9s. La direction tentait d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer les sexes et l\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans les \u00e9quipes, ainsi que de garantir les capacit\u00e9s linguistiques.\n[50] Toujours en 2004, chacun des trois chefs \u00e9tait assist\u00e9 dans ses fonctions de gestion et de coordination par un ou deux coordonnateurs des op\u00e9rations. Ces coordonnateurs des op\u00e9rations travaillaient en apr\u00e8s-midi, la fin de semaine et lors des jours f\u00e9ri\u00e9s.\n[51] \u00c0 partir du 12 f\u00e9vrier 2007, la structure de gestion a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e. Il y a maintenant 10 chefs au sein des Op\u00e9rations des passagers : trois pour chacun des deux terminaux, un chef de l\u2019Ex\u00e9cution, un chef des Services corporatifs, un chef du Programme d\u2019am\u00e9nagement a\u00e9roportuaire et un chef responsable de la politique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration.\n[52] Les surintendants des terminaux ont toujours la m\u00eame description de t\u00e2che g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Dans le domaine des services corporatifs, ils pr\u00e9parent les horaires de travail, g\u00e8rent l\u2019\u00e9valuation du rendement et surveillent le programme. Il y a pr\u00e9sentement deux surintendants qui g\u00e8rent toutes demandes d\u2019adaptation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des employ\u00e9s demandant \u00e0 \u00eatre exempt\u00e9s, peu importe la raison, de l\u2019horaire de l\u2019EPHV.\nIV. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents du tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le TCDP) et de la CCDP [53] Il existe un long historique entre l\u2019ASFC (et ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs), la CCDP, le TCDP et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale au sujet de la d\u00e9finition de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019emploi et au sujet de l\u2019application de d\u00e9cisions rendues pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Comme cet historie a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 souvent au cours de l\u2019audience, et que de nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet, il est utile d\u2019en pr\u00e9senter certaines parties comme cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n1984-1993\n[54] Le 17 f\u00e9vrier 1993 : La d\u00e9cision Brown c. Revenu national (Douanes et Accise), 1993 CanLII 683 (TCDP) (Brown), traitait de la question de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (la grossesse) et la situation de famille en contravention de la LCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait la pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseure de l\u2019ASFC, l\u2019Agence du Revenu national \u2013 Douanes et Accise. Comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019elle avait suffisamment accommod\u00e9 la plaignante, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 contrainte excessive, et que la plaignante n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 les efforts ad\u00e9quats pour obtenir des services de garde, dont elle seule avait le fardeau. Bien que la d\u00e9cision e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue en 1993, elle \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur des all\u00e9gations d\u2019actes qui avaient eu lieu en 1984 et en 1985. L\u2019instruction de la plainte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, avait n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 l\u2019examen de la nature de situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de discrimination illicite au sens de la LCDP.\n[55] \u00c0 la page 14 de la d\u00e9cision Brown (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e), le Tribunal a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les crit\u00e8res permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille :\na)[\u2026] la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d\u2019\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019emploi impartial, la plaignante n\u2019a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res.\n[56] \u00c0 la page 19 de la d\u00e9cision Brown, le tribunal a conclu que les parents ont l\u2019obligation de demander \u00e0 l\u2019employeur des mesures d\u2019adaptation afin qu\u2019ils puissent remplir leurs obligations envers l\u2019employeur ainsi que leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de leur famille. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 :\nDe l\u2019avis du Tribunal, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 2 de la LCDP en fonction de son objet consiste \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre clairement, dans le contexte de la situation de famille, le droit et l\u2019obligation du parent de chercher \u00e0 atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre ainsi que l\u2019obligation manifeste pour l\u2019employeur d\u2019aider le parent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alberta Dairy Pool. Une interpr\u00e9tation moins s\u00e9rieuse des probl\u00e8mes auxquels la famille moderne fait face dans le milieu de travail enl\u00e8verait tout son sens au concept de la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination.\n[57] Mme Brown \u00e9tait aussi une ASF (poste qui portait alors le nom d\u2019inspecteur des douanes), qui avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler durant le quart de jour et, si n\u00e9cessaire pour obtenir le quart de jour, d\u2019\u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s la naissance de son enfant, afin d\u2019accommoder ses besoins en service de garde parce que son mari et elle travaillaient tous les deux par quarts de travail. L\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas accept\u00e9 sa demande parce qu\u2019il ne reconnaissait pas les besoins en mati\u00e8re de responsabilit\u00e9s parentales d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui travaillait par quarts de travail comme \u00e9tant pour lui, l\u2019employeur, une obligation d\u2019adaptation au sens de la LCDP. Le Tribunal ayant conclu que le d\u00e9faut de l\u2019employeur d\u2019accueillir la demande de Mme Brown de travailler pendant les quarts de jour \u00e9tait discriminatoire, il a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019employeur d\u2019\u00e9crire une lettre d\u2019excuses \u00e0 Mme Brown et lui a ordonn\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9viter que des situations semblables se reproduisent, en \u00e9tablissant des politiques et en reconnaissant que la situation de famille doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme comprenant le droit et l\u2019obligation du parent de chercher \u00e0 atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre [entre les obligations du travail et celles de la famille] ainsi que l\u2019obligation manifeste pour l\u2019employeur d\u2019aider le parent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 54 ci-dessus.\n[58] Apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision, M. E. Hynna, sous-ministre adjoint, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des op\u00e9rations douani\u00e8res, a \u00e9crit une lettre d\u2019excuses en 1993 \u00e0 Mme Brown, dont deux \u00e9bauches non dat\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience avec des lettres de pr\u00e9sentation dat\u00e9es de juillet et ao\u00fbt 1993. La lettre comprenait les paragraphes suivants :\n[Traduction]\nCompte tenu des conclusions du Tribunal selon lesquelles la gestion r\u00e9gionale a fait preuve de discrimination envers vous pour les deux motifs pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans votre plainte dat\u00e9e du 17 juillet 1985 et, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal, je souhaite m\u2019excuser au nom du minist\u00e8re pour le d\u00e9faut d\u2019avoir pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour vous pendant et apr\u00e8s votre grossesse. Il est regrettable que la gestion n\u2019ait pas, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, facilit\u00e9 les circonstances entourant votre situation. Cependant, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter tout malentendu \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, je vous assure qu\u2019une politique minist\u00e9rielle est en cours d\u2019\u00e9laboration afin de garantir que des pratiques semblables n\u2019existeront plus \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Une copie de la pr\u00e9sente lettre est transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 la gestion au Bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 vos superviseurs imm\u00e9diats afin de leur rappeler leurs obligations en vertu de la LCDP.\n[59] Pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment, les deux derniers paragraphes faisaient r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, du moins en partie, au libell\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision Brown, \u00e0 la mesure de redressement num\u00e9ro 4, \u00e0 la page 19 : Afin de pr\u00e9venir d\u2019autres pratiques discriminatoires similaires \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, nous ordonnons \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment a l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante, pour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, de l\u2019existence d\u2019une politique d\u2019accommodement appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la mutation des employ\u00e9s.\n[60] Il est int\u00e9ressant de souligner que M.

M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que vers cette \u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait directeur des programmes depuis trois ans au Bureau r\u00e9gional du Grand Toronto et que, \u00e0 partir de 1989, il a occup\u00e9 le poste de chef des Op\u00e9rations au TAP pour le terminal 2, puis le poste de chef des Op\u00e9rations au TAP pour le terminal 2 pendant un an, suivi de divers postes au bureau r\u00e9gional, tels que gestionnaire des Services op\u00e9rationnels, chef des Services op\u00e9rationnels, directeur des Ressources humaines et chef des Drawbacks, remboursements et remises. Il ressort du fait qu\u2019il a occup\u00e9 ces postes \u00e9lev\u00e9s aux op\u00e9rations et aux ressources humaines que M. Sheridan connaissait bien la d\u00e9cision Brown.\n1993\u20111995\n[61] 1993 : Une autre lettre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve dat\u00e9e du 19 juillet 1993 et mentionnant la d\u00e9cision Brown, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crite par Dianne Dioguardi, agente des relations du travail, Section des op\u00e9rations, Division des relations de travail et de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des ressources humaines, Revenu Canada, Douanes et accise Revenu Canada.

Venier, avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Contentieux des affaires civiles, Bureau r\u00e9gional de Toronto, qui travaillait aussi pour Revenu Canada.

Une lettre de John Viassi Nagy, avocat du Contentieux des affaires civiles, dat\u00e9e du 18 mars 1994, a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e \u00e0 William F. Pentney de la CCDP et comprenait une \u00e9bauche de politique visant \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Brown. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision Brown, qui a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9 sur consentement des deux parties en 1995 afin de permettre le r\u00e8glement des questions en suspens.\n1998-1999\n[63] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a commenc\u00e9 un examen de l\u2019\u00e9tat de l\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision Brown en novembre 1998, qui a finalement entra\u00een\u00e9 le rejet de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Une lettre du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor dat\u00e9e du 5 octobre 1999 et adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la CCDP, pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve, traite de la collaboration du Secr\u00e9tariat avec la CCDP pour mettre en \u0153uvre la d\u00e9cision Brown et donne un historique de la question. La lettre notait que d\u2019autres questions d\u2019application de la d\u00e9cision avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9es, mais pas la partie exigeant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9labore une politique d\u2019accommodement conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision.\n2000\n[64] La Division des relations de travail de l\u2019ADRC a organis\u00e9 et tenu une s\u00e9ance de planification strat\u00e9gique sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2000. Pendant cette s\u00e9ance, les participants ont examin\u00e9 une \u00e9bauche de document pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le personnel de la Division et intitul\u00e9e [Traduction] \u00c9bauche \u2013 Introduction \u00e0 la Direction strat\u00e9gique de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour l\u2019ADRC qui portait la date du 2 novembre 2000. Le document r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu\u2019il y avait \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque une reconnaissance interne du fardeau disproportionn\u00e9 que portaient les femmes employ\u00e9es, en mati\u00e8re de soins aux enfants et de responsabilit\u00e9s familiales connexes et, aux pages 5 et 6 du document, il y \u00e9tait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[Traduction] L\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre le travail et la famille est une question qui affecte de nombreuses femmes qui travaillent \u00e0 la fonction publique et au sein de l\u2019ADRC. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les femmes continuent de jouer un plus grand r\u00f4le que les hommes dans les soins aux enfants, les soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s et les t\u00e2ches m\u00e9nag\u00e8res. Ce probl\u00e8me peut \u00eatre aggrav\u00e9 par une culture organisationnelle qui ne reconna\u00eet pas ce fait [non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original], ce qui peut ensuite avoir des effets n\u00e9gatifs sur la r\u00e9partition des femmes au sein de l\u2019organisation. Dans une \u00e9tude produite par le Conference Board du Canada, lorsqu\u2019on a demand\u00e9 quelles \u00e9taient les r\u00e9percussions des conflits travail-famille, 32 % des r\u00e9pondants (54 % f\u00e9minins, 46 % masculins), ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont refus\u00e9 une promotion ou ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas pr\u00e9senter leur candidature. Quatorze pour cent des r\u00e9pondants ont quitt\u00e9 un emploi en raison d\u2019un conflit travail-famille, alors que 24 % des r\u00e9pondants ont refus\u00e9 un transfert ou ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas poser leur candidature en raison d\u2019un tel conflit. Les femmes ont traditionnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 marginalis\u00e9es dans le march\u00e9 du travail [\u2026] Cette tendance para\u00eet aussi \u00e0 l\u2019ADRC, o\u00f9 les femmes dominent la cat\u00e9gorie du personnel de bureau, avec des taux de repr\u00e9sentation de plus de 80 %, soit 10 % de plus que la disponibilit\u00e9 sur le march\u00e9 du travail. Il y a sous-repr\u00e9sentation des femmes \u00e0 l\u2019ADRC dans la cat\u00e9gorie professionnelle et la cat\u00e9gorie de l\u2019administration des programmes et personnel de bureau principal [\u2026] Fait surprenant, les femmes obtiennent des dipl\u00f4mes universitaires \u00e0 un taux de 58 % par rapport aux hommes. Ce taux se maintient dans le domaine des sciences sociales et dans le domaine des arts et des sciences, o\u00f9 les femmes obtiennent des dipl\u00f4mes universitaires \u00e0 un taux de 67 % par rapport aux hommes. La majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ADRC se trouvent dans la cat\u00e9gorie de l\u2019administration des programmes et personnel de bureau principal. C\u2019est dans ce groupe que la majorit\u00e9 de nos inspecteurs des douanes et de nos agents du revenu dans la cat\u00e9gorie de l\u2019administration des programmes (PM) se trouve.\n2001-2003\n[65] 8 novembre 2001 : \u00c0 cette date, l\u2019ADRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e officiellement d\u2019une v\u00e9rification \u00e0 venir de la CCDP, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi.

Bien que Ronda Raby eut ni\u00e9 avoir eu connaissance du document \u00e0 la r\u00e9union et \u00e0 l\u2019audience, un autre employ\u00e9 de la gestion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la r\u00e9union a avou\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

Le dossier de la plaignante A. Le t\u00e9moignage de Fiona Johnstone [78] Avant la naissance de ses enfants, Mme Johnstone travaillait \u00e0 temps plein par quarts de travail rotatifs conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019EPHV dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question ci\u2011dessus. Cependant, lorsqu\u2019elle est devenue m\u00e8re et la principale responsable de l\u2019\u00e9ducation de ses enfants, elle ne pouvait plus suivre l\u2019horaire de l\u2019EPHV et respecter ses obligations l\u00e9gales et morales, en raison de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver un service de garde.\n[79] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 payer pour un service de garde pour ses enfants. Cependant, elle a rapidement d\u00e9couvert que les heures normales de garderie pour toutes les installations enregistr\u00e9es \u00e9taient de 7 h \u00e0 18 h, du lundi au vendredi.\n[80] Mme Johnstone a aussi d\u00e9couvert que m\u00eame les garderies non enregistr\u00e9es ou les garderies priv\u00e9es n\u2019offrent pas de services de garde de fa\u00e7on impr\u00e9visible et variable, n\u2019en offrent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas la fin de semaine et certainement pas pendant la nuit.\n[81] Mme Johnstone s\u2019est alors tourn\u00e9e vers les membres de sa famille et a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir un service de garde pour des heures impr\u00e9visibles, y compris pendant la nuit, pour trois jours par semaine. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a contest\u00e9 la diligence de la plaignante en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019obtention des services de garde, cependant, le Tribunal accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Johnstone au sujet du fait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la meilleure situation qu\u2019elle ait pu organiser pour la garde de ses enfants.\n[82] La preuve montre que les exigences des quarts de travail de Jason, qui \u00e9tait aussi un ASF au TAP, bien qu\u2019il f\u00fbt superviseur, \u00e9taient beaucoup plus lourdes que celles de Mme Johnstone. Leurs horaires se chevauchaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement 60 % du temps, mais n\u2019\u00e9taient pas coordonn\u00e9s d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelconque. Jason ne pouvait pas non plus s\u2019occuper de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de ses enfants pendant les heures o\u00f9 Mme Johnstone avait besoin de services de garde.\n[83] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l\u2019option d\u2019embaucher une gouvernante ou un service de garde \u00e0 domicile n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible en raison du co\u00fbt et de l\u2019obligation qu\u2019elle et sa famille auraient de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager dans une maison qui pouvait accommoder un adulte de plus. Comme le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019experts l\u2019a montr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une option viable pour la majorit\u00e9 des familles canadiennes pour les m\u00eames raisons.\n[84] Bien qu\u2019il f\u00fbt \u00e9vident que le processus de la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 une \u00e9preuve \u00e9motionnelle pour Mme Johnstone, son t\u00e9moignage, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re franche, montre clairement qu\u2019elle aime son travail d\u2019ASF et qu\u2019elle est fi\u00e8re de ses r\u00e9alisations au travail.\n[85] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pris un engagement \u00e0 long terme envers son r\u00f4le d\u2019ASF et qu\u2019elle souhaitait en faire une carri\u00e8re \u00e0 vie. C\u2019est la raison pour laquelle sa plus grande pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9tait celle de perdre sa pension et ses autres avantages sociaux, dont les cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 long terme auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 ses futures occasions de promotion et \u00e0 sa retraite.\n[86] Mme Johnstone a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souhaitait retourner au travail \u00e0 temps plein, mais qu\u2019elle avait besoin de le faire sur trois jours. Elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 d\u2019heure de d\u00e9but pour ces trois jours et elle n\u2019a pas insist\u00e9 \u00e0 revenir aux t\u00e2ches qu\u2019elle avait effectu\u00e9es auparavant. Le plus important pour elle \u00e9tait de travailler au moins 37,5 heures par semaine et de maintenir son droit \u00e0 pension, ses avantages sociaux et ses occasions de formation et d\u2019avancement.\n[87] Cependant, Mme Johnstone s\u2019est frapp\u00e9e \u00e0 une politique non \u00e9crite arbitraire que l\u2019ASFC appliquait aux employ\u00e9s qui demandaient des mesures d\u2019adaptation en raison de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s parentales. Mme Johnstone a appris, apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 des coll\u00e8gues qui \u00e9taient revenues de cong\u00e9s de maternit\u00e9, que si elle demandait des quarts de travail fixes qui ne respecteraient pas l\u2019EPHV, l\u2019ASFC ne lui permettrait de travailler qu\u2019\u00e0 temps partiel. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a communiqu\u00e9 avec une surintendante du terminal 2, Mme Gerstl, \u00e0 la fin 2003 pour lui demander de travailler \u00e0 temps plein sur trois jours. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Gerstl lui a r\u00e9pondu par courriel que cela allait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la politique de l\u2019ASFC. Bien que l\u2019ASFC e\u00fbt dout\u00e9 de l\u2019existence de cet \u00e9change et que Mme Johnstone n\u2019e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de produire une copie du courriel, l\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gerstl de t\u00e9moigner, pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie au moment de l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Johnstone au sujet de cet \u00e9change de courriels.\n[88] L\u2019ASFC est d\u2019avis que les employ\u00e9s qui demandent des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour leurs obligations parentales le font par suite des choix qu\u2019ils ont faits, et dont l\u2019employeur n\u2019a par \u00e0 porter la responsabilit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire quelques ajustements \u00e0 l\u2019horaire d\u2019un tel employ\u00e9, elle qualifie ces ajustements d\u2019[Traduction] ententes plut\u00f4t que d\u2019[Traduction] accommodements. M. Norm Sheridan a expliqu\u00e9 cet avis au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[89] Mme Johnstone savait par ce qu\u2019elle avait pu observer pendant son emploi \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait toujours consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que seules les personnes qui demandaient des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales relevaient de ses obligations en vertu des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. De tels employ\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent une \u00e9valuation de fa\u00e7on individuelle. Leurs horaires de travail sont modifi\u00e9s conform\u00e9ment aux recommandations ou aux renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur demande et, si leurs besoins m\u00e9dicaux particuliers le requierent, les employ\u00e9s obtiennent des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein.\n[90] Mme Johnstone a plus tard appris, apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 avec Murray Star qui \u00e9tait alors un repr\u00e9sentant syndical, qu\u2019il avait obtenu des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour des raisons religieuses, mais seulement apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une plainte afin de pouvoir observer le jour du sabbat et d\u2019autres jours sacr\u00e9s de la religion juive. M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[91] Lorsqu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de trouver un service de garde qui lui permettrait de travailler \u00e0 temps plein en suivant l\u2019horaire de l\u2019EPHV, Mme Johnstone a tent\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir un horaire \u00e0 temps plein malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle savait que dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, un tel horaire \u00e9tait refus\u00e9. Elle pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande en partie parce qu\u2019elle savait qu\u2019il y avait eu des exceptions \u00e0 la politique non \u00e9crite et que certaines employ\u00e9es, en retour de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, avaient obtenu des horaires fixes de jour et des quarts de travail plus longs que les huit heures habituelles par jour.\n[92] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle connaissait au moins deux autres coll\u00e8gues, qu\u2019elle a nomm\u00e9s, qui travaillaient pendant des quarts de travail de neuf heures, quatre jours par semaine, pour un total de 36 heures par semaine. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les deux employ\u00e9s lui en avaient parl\u00e9 et que de toute fa\u00e7on, leurs horaires sont affich\u00e9s \u00e0 la vue de tous. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ce fait. En d\u2019autres mots, la politique ne limitait pas ces employ\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler seulement 34 heures par semaine, ni \u00e0 travailler le quart de travail habituel de 8 heures par jour.\n[93] Mme Johnstone a aussi nomm\u00e9 une autre coll\u00e8gue qui travaillait des quarts de 11 heures en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s envers ses enfants \u00e0 la maison. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ce fait.\n[94] Mme Johnstone a aussi nomm\u00e9 deux autres coll\u00e8gues qui, au d\u00e9part, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 un programme \u00e0 temps plein de soutien dans des quarts de travail de jour en raison de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s familiales et que ces deux employ\u00e9s sont rest\u00e9s dans ces postes apr\u00e8s que leurs besoins d\u2019accommodement eurent cess\u00e9. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 ce fait. Par cons\u00e9quent, la politique ne limitait pas ces coll\u00e8gues \u00e0 travailler seulement \u00e0 temps partiel jusqu\u2019\u00e0 34 heures par semaine.\n[95] Le repr\u00e9sentant syndical de Mme Johnstone, Murray Star, l\u2019a encourag\u00e9e \u00e0 demander \u00e0 retourner au travail \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 son retour de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Cependant, lorsque la surintendante Gerstl lui a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait impossible, Mme Johnstone, par l\u2019entremise de son mari, a approch\u00e9 Rhonda Raby, qui \u00e9tait alors chef du terminal 1, pour demander \u00e0 travailler des quarts de travail de 12 heures sur trois jours. Cela a eu lieu peu de temps avant que Mme Johnstone retourne au travail apr\u00e8s son premier cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Mme Raby a rejet\u00e9 la demande en soutenant qu\u2019un tel accommodement soul\u00e8verait des pr\u00e9occupations de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[96] Mme Raby a aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que, pour que Mme Johnstone puisse obtenir des quarts de travail fixes, elle pouvait travailler au maximum 34 heures par semaine.\n[97] Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Raby a offert \u00e0 Mme Johnstone de travailler un maximum de 10 heures par jour, 3 jours par semaine, en plus d\u2019un quart de travail de 4 heures lors d\u2019une quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e. Les heures de d\u00e9but pouvaient varier mais les quarts de travail seraient pendant les m\u00eames jours de la semaine, chaque semaine. Mme Raby n\u2019a pos\u00e9 aucune question \u00e0 Mme Johnstone au sujet de ses efforts pour obtenir un service de garde, ni au sujet des raisons pour lesquelles elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir un tel service de garde, mais elle a simplement appliqu\u00e9 la politique non \u00e9crite de l\u2019ASFC.\n[98] En ce qui a trait au travail lors d\u2019une quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e, cette option n\u2019\u00e9tait pas viable pour Mme Johnstone. Comme elle ne pouvait pas travailler \u00e0 temps plein de toute fa\u00e7on, elle ne souhaitait pas avoir \u00e0 payer pour un service de garde pour la courte quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e. Elle ne savait pas si elle \u00e9tait en mesure d\u2019obtenir un service de garde pour la quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e, mais m\u00eame si elle le pouvait, les co\u00fbts pour le d\u00e9placement aller-retour pour le service de garde et pour le travail, en plus du co\u00fbt du service de garde m\u00eame, annulaient tout avantage qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e0 gagner un salaire pour quatre heures de plus.\n[99] Apr\u00e8s la naissance de son premier enfant, Mme Johnstone a \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d\u2019obtenir des services de garde les vendredis, les dimanches et les lundis. Comme elle l\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 travailler 13 heures et \u00e0 faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pendant ces jours. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019acceptait pas cette suggestion, comme Mme Gerstl le lui a dit, et qu\u2019elle ne lui permettrait pas de travailler 36 heures par semaine, Mme Johnstone a finalement accept\u00e9 de travailler seulement 10 heures pendant les trois jours o\u00f9 des membres de sa famille pouvaient s\u2019occuper de son enfant.\n[100] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que peu apr\u00e8s son retour au travail apr\u00e8s son premier cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur si elle pouvait garder son statut d\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein et faire qualifier les heures manquantes de cong\u00e9 sans solde. Elle savait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque que les cong\u00e9s sans solde ouvraient droit \u00e0 pension. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne lui a pas permis de le faire. Mme Johnstone a aussi demand\u00e9 si elle pouvait [Traduction] compl\u00e9menter la diff\u00e9rence afin de lui permettre de garder l\u2019\u00e9quivalent du droit \u00e0 pension \u00e0 temps plein, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne le lui a pas permis. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 cette application de ces politiques non \u00e9crites.\n[101] Mme Johnstone a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9, et le Tribunal accepte, que si elle avait pu travailler \u00e0 temps plein lors des trois jours demand\u00e9s, elle aurait trouv\u00e9 un moyen de g\u00e9rer ses responsabilit\u00e9s envers ses enfants afin de pouvoir travailler pendant ces jours, tant apr\u00e8s la naissance de son premier enfant qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la naissance du deuxi\u00e8me. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur, avant la fin de son deuxi\u00e8me cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, de lui permettre de travailler \u00e0 temps plein sur trois jours, mais sa demande a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9e.\n[102] Mme Johnstone a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle travaillait moins de 30 heures par semaine apr\u00e8s la naissance de son deuxi\u00e8me enfant, parce qu\u2019on l\u2019avait forc\u00e9e \u00e0 laisser tomber la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein et qu\u2019elle avait plus de responsabilit\u00e9s familiales. Une fois de plus, la gestion de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pos\u00e9 aucune question \u00e0 Mme Johnstone au sujet de sa situation particuli\u00e8re.\n[103] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en plus du calcul au prorata de sa pension et de ses avantages, en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps partiel, elle ratait des occasions de formation, elle ne pouvait pas devenir surintendante par int\u00e9rim et elle ne pouvait pas travailler dans des \u00e9quipes sp\u00e9ciales. Les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires sont aussi pay\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on moindre pour les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel par rapport aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein.\n[104] Mme Johnstone connaissait des employ\u00e9es, qu\u2019elle a nomm\u00e9es, qui \u00e9tait revenues de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et qui avaient obtenu des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein au TAP. Elle connaissait aussi des ASF, qu\u2019elle a nomm\u00e9s, dans d\u2019autres op\u00e9rations qui travaillaient des quarts de 13 heures, par exemple \u00e0 Niagara Falls (Ontario) et \u00e0 Estevan (Saskatchewan). Elle ne savait pas \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pouvait la transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 une autre partie de ses op\u00e9rations, telles que Gateway o\u00f9 les quarts de travail fixes \u00e9taient la norme. Elle a eu connaissance de ce renseignement au cours du processus de la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[105] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Johnstone si elle connaissait d\u2019autres couples d\u2019ASF, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire o\u00f9 les deux partenaires travaillent comme ASF au TAP. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle connaissait 20 couples dans l\u2019effectif d\u2019environ 275 employ\u00e9s. De ces 20 couples, la plupart, mais pas la totalit\u00e9, a des enfants. Pour les couples qui ont des enfants, un petit pourcentage a des enfants qui ne sont pas d\u2019\u00e2ge scolaire, et environ 8 des 20 couples sont compos\u00e9s de partenaires qui ont des horaires \u00e0 quarts rotatifs comme elle. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[106] Au moment de l\u2019audience, Mme Johnstone \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 sans solde pour les soins et l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019un enfant, pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019EPHV. Auparavant, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 sans solde d\u2019un an pour r\u00e9installation du conjoint, parce que son mari avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Ottawa comme formateur. Des dispositions relativement nouvelles sont en place exigeant que les ASF portent une arme \u00e0 feu, et Jason est qualifi\u00e9 pour donner cette nouvelle formation. Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle aurait pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 travailler pendant ces deux p\u00e9riodes, mais que comme elle ne pouvait pas travailler \u00e0 temps plein de toute fa\u00e7on, elle a pris ces cong\u00e9s sans solde.\n[107] Comme ses deux enfants seront d\u2019\u00e2ge scolaire en septembre 2010, Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle souhaite travailler \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0. Des dispositions dans l\u2019EPHV pr\u00e9voient les situations o\u00f9 une \u00e9pouse doit quitter une ville (Toronto) pour habiter dans une autre ville (Ottawa) afin d\u2019\u00eatre avec son \u00e9poux. Cette situation exige que des mesures d\u2019adaptation soient prises pour qu\u2019elle obtienne un poste dans son nouveau lieu de r\u00e9sidence, soit Ottawa.\n[108] En ce qui a trait au milieu de travail en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, en r\u00e9ponse aux questions que l\u2019avocat de la CCDP lui a pos\u00e9es, Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ni l\u2019intim\u00e9e ni le syndicat ne lui avaient donn\u00e9 de renseignements, \u00e9crits ou verbaux, au sujet des politiques d\u2019accommodement de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ou de ses droits. Elle a nomm\u00e9 des coll\u00e8gues qui travaillent aussi \u00e0 temps partiel, \u00e0 qui on avait refus\u00e9 le statut \u00e0 temps plein demand\u00e9 en raison des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales. Elle a aussi nomm\u00e9 des coll\u00e8gues qui travaillaient \u00e0 temps partiel par choix.\n[109] En contre-interrogatoire, on a pos\u00e9 de nombreuses questions \u00e0 Mme Johnstone au sujet de la nature de ses t\u00e2ches en tant qu\u2019ASF en ce qui a trait au besoin de se concentrer, de porter une attention particuli\u00e8re, de maintenir sa vigilance, d\u2019\u00e9valuer les risques, de g\u00e9rer l\u2019agressivit\u00e9 du public, etc. Il semble que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e tentait de pr\u00e9senter une preuve, par son contre-interrogatoire, de pr\u00e9occupations pour la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u00e9coulant de quarts de travail longs. Mme Johnstone n\u2019a jamais exprim\u00e9 le sentiment qu\u2019elle ne pourrait pas g\u00e9rer les longs quarts de travail qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9s.\nB. Le t\u00e9moignage de Murray Star [110] M. Star est employ\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC depuis 1990 \u00e0 titre d\u2019ASF. De 1996 \u00e0 2000, il a occup\u00e9 le poste de superviseur par int\u00e9rim pendant diverses p\u00e9riodes et il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation d\u2019autres ASF pendant sa carri\u00e8re.\n[111] Vers 1999, M. Star \u00e9tait un d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical et, de 2003 \u00e0 2008, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif repr\u00e9sentant les membres du syndicat. Au moment de l\u2019audience, il n\u2019\u00e9tait plus d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif.\n[112] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait lui-m\u00eame eu des probl\u00e8mes faisant intervenir la loi (vers 2001) parce que ses conditions d\u2019emploi ne refl\u00e9taient pas ses pratiques au sujet du sabbat et des f\u00eates religieuses. Comme il est juif, il souhaitait ne pas travailler \u00e0 partir du coucher du soleil le vendredi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin du samedi, ni lors des Grandes F\u00eates juives.\n[113] Au d\u00e9but, son chef de terminal a accept\u00e9 que des mesures d\u2019adaptation soient prises pour lui et lui a permis d\u2019\u00e9changer ses quarts de travail pendant un an. Cependant, M. Norm Sheridan \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le droit \u00e0 l\u2019observation d\u2019une f\u00eate religieuse ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019une fois par ann\u00e9e, et non hebdomadairement. M. Star a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la LCDP. M. Sheridan a donn\u00e9 le pouvoir \u00e0 chacun des chefs de terminal de trancher la question en fonction des [Traduction] exigences op\u00e9rationnelles. L\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la CCDP a tir\u00e9 une conclusion favorable envers M. Star et les parties, en m\u00e9diation, en sont arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 une entente donnant \u00e0 M. Star la mesure d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9e.\n[114] M. Star a travaill\u00e9 avec Mme Johnstone et a d\u00e9crit son rendement comme [Traduction] excellent. Il l\u2019a aussi aid\u00e9e \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa premi\u00e8re demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation et plus tard, sa plainte en vertu de la LCDP lorsqu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas obtenu l\u2019adaptation qu\u2019elle demandait.\n[115] M. Star savait que Mme Johnstone, au retour de son premier cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, souhaitait travailler des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein. Peu apr\u00e8s son retour, d\u00e9but janvier 2004, Mme Johnstone a confi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Star qu\u2019elle voulait travailler des quarts de travail fixes \u00e0 temps plein. Il savait qu\u2019elle avait approch\u00e9 la gestion \u00e0 ce sujet, mais qu\u2019elle avait [Traduction] essuy\u00e9 une rebuffade. Il s\u2019est souvenu avoir discut\u00e9 de la demande de Mme Johnstone avec Norm Sheridan \u00e0 plus d\u2019une occasion pendant la p\u00e9riode de 2004 \u00e0 2006. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Sheridan lui a dit que Mme Johnstone n\u2019obtiendrait pas la mesure d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019elle demandait parce que si l\u2019ASFC la lui accordait, [Traduction] tous les employ\u00e9s voudraient la m\u00eame chose.\n[116] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sheridan les raisons op\u00e9rationnelles justifiant sa position, verbalement et par \u00e9crit, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse.\n[117] Compte tenu de sa grande connaissance des Op\u00e9rations des passagers et de l\u2019EPHV, ainsi que de son exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant syndical et de repr\u00e9sentant des employ\u00e9s, M. Star a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019accueil de la demande de Mme Johnstone n\u2019aurait pas eu d\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable, financier ou autre, pour l\u2019ASFC. Il a aussi soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu connaissance d\u2019effets op\u00e9rationnels pr\u00e9judiciables d\u00e9coulant des mesures d\u2019adaptation d\u00e9j\u00e0 prises pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales.\n[118] M. Star a confirm\u00e9 que le syndicat \u00e9tait ouvert aux demandes sp\u00e9ciales pour des raisons de droit de la personne et qu\u2019il appuyait ces demandes. M. Star a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif du syndicat appuyait fortement toute demande individuelle, parce qu\u2019il ne [Traduction] porterait jamais atteinte aux droits de la personne de quiconque.\n[119] M. Star a confirm\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019EPHV en place en 2004, le nouveau EPHV, qui est entr\u00e9 en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2008, pr\u00e9voit des quarts de travail de 12 heures. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un horaire de cinq jours de travail, quatre jours de cong\u00e9 qui comprend des quarts multiples qui commencent \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes heures au cours de la journ\u00e9e pendant une p\u00e9riode de 63 jours. Il y a environ 12 quarts de travail pr\u00e9vus dans les divisions des douanes et de l\u2019immigration dans un environnement de travail qui va de 5 h du matin jusqu\u2019\u00e0 minuit. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il pouvait nommer au moins cinq ou six employ\u00e9s qui travaillent pendant des quarts de travail fixes sur cinq jours.\n[120] M. Star a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il connaissait personnellement environ 12 employ\u00e9s qui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient, pour diverses raisons, d\u2019horaires de quarts de travail fais sur mesure. Il a nomm\u00e9 un coll\u00e8gue qui demandait des quarts de travail fixes de minuit (de 22 h \u00e0 8 h), que la gestion a accept\u00e9. Il a confirm\u00e9, en fonction des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, qu\u2019un certain nombre d\u2019ASF travaillent des quarts de travail fixes de minuit, ou les m\u00eames trois, quatre ou cinq jours toutes les semaines. Par exemple, les \u00e9quipes \u00e0 horaires fixes (principalement des nouveaux employ\u00e9s) peuvent travailler des heures diff\u00e9rentes, mais occupent principalement les quarts d\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi et leurs jours de travail sont fixes, habituellement lors de la p\u00e9riode la plus occup\u00e9e du jeudi au dimanche. Le quart de travail le plus populaire est celui du soir, de midi \u00e0 23 h ou de 15 h \u00e0 3 h, parce que les jeunes employ\u00e9s ne semblent pas \u00eatre des l\u00e8ves-t\u00f4t.\n[121] M. Star n\u2019a jamais eu connaissance, pendant toute sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC, que des coll\u00e8gues se soient plainte de traitements de faveur lorsqu\u2019une demande de mesures d\u2019adaptation a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie par la gestion. M. Star n\u2019a pas remarqu\u00e9 d\u2019effets pr\u00e9judiciables sur les op\u00e9rations au TAP de l\u2019ASFC d\u00e9coulant d\u2019accommodements pour raisons m\u00e9dicales ou pour raisons religieuses.\n[122] M. Star savait que la gestion n\u2019avait pas emp\u00each\u00e9 des ASF d\u2019effectuer des transferts [Traduction] t\u00eate pour t\u00eate, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en nombre \u00e9gal afin de maintenir le m\u00eame type d\u2019effectif (pour diverses raisons autres que les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales), d\u2019une partie des op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 une autre, par exemple des Op\u00e9rations des passagers \u00e0 Gateway, ou vice versa. M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la nature du travail \u00e0 Gateway est moins exigeante et moins vari\u00e9e qu\u2019aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers et qu\u2019un ASF n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019une nouvelle formation s\u2019il passe des Op\u00e9rations des passagers ou des Op\u00e9rations commerciales \u00e0 Gateway. M. Star conna\u00eet plusieurs ASF qui ont transf\u00e9r\u00e9 des Op\u00e9rations des passagers \u00e0 Gateway.\n[123] M. Star sait que tous les droits \u00e0 pension et les avantages sociaux sont calcul\u00e9s au prorata pour les personnes qui [Traduction] choisissent de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel. Il connait une ASF aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers, qu\u2019il a nomm\u00e9s, qui a r\u00e9duit ses heures de travail apr\u00e8s son retour de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, mais qui a obtenu la permission d\u2019inscrire les heures non travaill\u00e9es comme cong\u00e9 sans solde et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, a maintenu ses avantages en payant le montant total de sa pension. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Johnstone.\n[124] M. Star ne connaissait aucune mesure d\u2019adaptation officielle offerte par l\u2019ASFC pour des raisons familiales et a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune politique \u00e9crite exigeant qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite obtenir des quarts de travail fixes en raison d\u2019obligations parentales travaille \u00e0 temps partiel. Ce sont les d\u00e9cisions de la gestion locale qui ont force d\u2019application en ce qui a trait aux demandes pour les horaires. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la [Traduction] gestion locale signifie la gestion du TAP.\n[125] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement dat\u00e9e de juin 2007. Ce document de 13 pages lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 en 2007 par John King, un ancien repr\u00e9sentant syndical qui est devenu pr\u00e9sident syndical. M. King l\u2019a avis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque qu\u2019il avait ramass\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9bauche lors d\u2019une [Traduction] r\u00e9union d\u2019ordre op\u00e9rationnel, qui est une r\u00e9union des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs du syndicat et de la gestion qui a lieu de temps \u00e0 autre pour discuter de questions op\u00e9rationnelles.\n[126] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait utilis\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement lors de ses n\u00e9gociations avec la gestion pour un employ\u00e9 qui demandait un accommodement pour raisons m\u00e9dicales. Lors de la r\u00e9union en 2007 o\u00f9 il a produit l\u2019\u00e9bauche, M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Raby avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait aucune connaissance de cette \u00e9bauche et qu\u2019elle doutait de son authenticit\u00e9.\n[127] Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, le superviseur Darren Millet, qui \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la r\u00e9union, a reconnu qu\u2019il avait vu l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement auparavant et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 distribu\u00e9e aux gestionnaires pour qu\u2019ils donnent leur opinion. M. Star a eu la vive impression, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que M. Millet disait, que la gestion ne tenait pas trop \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9bauche des politiques d\u2019accommodement. M. Star a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Millet si les employ\u00e9s pouvaient s\u2019attendre \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e en vigueur, question \u00e0 laquelle M. Millet n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu. M. Star a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019aucune des dispositions de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement n\u2019est entr\u00e9e en vigueur.\n[128] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement r\u00e9pond \u00e0 toutes les demandes des employ\u00e9s et qu\u2019un document de ce genre serait [Traduction] parfait. Par le pass\u00e9, il a offert aux gestionnaires de l\u2019ASFC de travailler avec eux afin d\u2019\u00e9laborer une politique pour les mesures d\u2019accommodement pour des raisons familiales, sans succ\u00e8s.\n[129] M. Star a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 Gateway, situ\u00e9e \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019a\u00e9roport, il y a de nombreux quarts de travail. Il y a un quart de travail de 12 heures et demie sur 3 jours, beaucoup de quarts de travail de jour du lundi au vendredi et des quarts de travail fixes en apr\u00e8s-midi du lundi au vendredi, etc. M. Star a fait observer que la gestion \u00e0 Gateway est plus ouverte aux demandes d\u2019accommodement des employ\u00e9s en ce qui a trait aux heures et aux quarts de travail particuliers. Gateway n\u2019est ouvert que du dimanche soir au vendredi.\n[130] M. Star a aussi confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu une proposition de la gestion pour la [Traduction] soumission pour les quarts par rotation non fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qui n\u2019a aucune r\u00e9percussion n\u00e9gative sur les op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC. Cependant, la proposition n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u0153uvre parce que la gestion et le syndicat n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capables de trouver un processus fonctionnel qui n\u2019entrait pas en conflit avec l\u2019EPHV. Il n\u2019est pas clair si cette proposition de soumission pour les quarts aurait aid\u00e9 la plaignante et ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre des parties ne s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur cette proposition pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[131] Le Tribunal a trait\u00e9 de la position du syndicat dans la d\u00e9cision 2009 TCDP 14, puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le syndicat soit ajout\u00e9 comme partie \u00e0 l\u2019audience parce que le syndicat pouvait partager une certaine responsabilit\u00e9 pour tout acte discriminatoire, en raison de l\u2019EPHV qui emp\u00eache l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019accorder \u00e0 la plaignante l\u2019accommodement qu\u2019elle demande. Le syndicat a appuy\u00e9 les mesures d\u2019adaptation que Mme Johnstone demandait, soutenant que ces mesures ne n\u00e9cessitaient pas de changement \u00e0 la convention collective ou \u00e0 l\u2019EPHV, mais n\u00e9cessitaient seulement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tablisse une politique d\u2019accommodement fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, concluant que Mme Johnstone n\u2019avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune all\u00e9gation contre le syndicat et que rien ne donnait \u00e0 penser que la convention collective ou l\u2019EPHV avaient jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les politiques de la gestion au sujet des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte.\n[132] Quand on lui a pos\u00e9 des questions au sujet des ASF qui travaillent \u00e0 temps partiel, M. Star a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que certains employ\u00e9s travaillaient \u00e0 temps partiel pour des raisons familiales, pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales ou par choix personnel, par exemple un employ\u00e9 qui est pr\u00e8s de la retraite. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, lorsqu\u2019une demande fond\u00e9e sur ces raisons est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, l\u2019ASF s\u2019asseoit avec la gestion et un quart de travail qui correspond \u00e0 la demande particuli\u00e8re est \u00e9tabli. G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel travaillent lors des quarts d\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi (10 heures \u00e0 20 heures; midi \u00e0 22 heures). Les apr\u00e8s-midis sont la p\u00e9riode la plus occup\u00e9e au TAP, alors cet arrangement correspond bien aux objectifs op\u00e9rationnels de la gestion.\n[133] Quant \u00e0 ses propres mesures d\u2019adaptation pour des raisons religieuses, M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 toute nouvelle p\u00e9riode de quarts de travail (maintenant \u00e0 tous les 63 jours), il s\u2019asseoit avec son superviseur et ils \u00e9tablissent son quart de travail. Ce processus prend g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement environ 5 minutes : trois minutes pour discuter et deux minutes pour effectuer les changements sur l\u2019horaire de travail dans l\u2019ordinateur. M. Star ne travaille pas tard les vendredis et il ne travaille pas du tout les samedis. Les dimanches sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sa journ\u00e9e la plus longue, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de 5 h \u00e0 15 h 15. Il commence \u00e0 des heures diff\u00e9rentes, sur des jours fixes.\n[134] M. Star a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait que sa demande d\u2019accommodement lui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e n\u2019a pas suscit\u00e9 une [Traduction] avalanche de demandes semblables d\u2019accommodement pour raisons religieuses. Quelques autres ASF ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des demandes, qui ont rapidement \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es, mais c\u2019\u00e9tait tout. Quant aux demandes en raison de la situation familiale, en contre-interrogatoire, M. Star s\u2019est d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant l\u2019 expert sur la question alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 syndical \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif et que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s qui demandaient des accommodements pour leurs responsabilit\u00e9s familiales venaient le voir. Il a soutenu que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas tous les employ\u00e9s qui demandaient un accommodement en raison de leur situation familiale qui souhaitaient obtenir des quarts de travail fixes, mais certains d\u2019entre eux le voulaient. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 si lui et le syndicat croyaient que toutes les demandes de ce genre devraient \u00eatre accept\u00e9es, il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la gestion pouvait prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour cette raison jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9montre une contrainte excessive, par exemple que le moral \u00e9tait bas, que le co\u00fbt \u00e9tait prohibitif ou qu\u2019il y aurait des mises \u00e0 pied inacceptables en raison des mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[135] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pour les ASF, chaque heure travaill\u00e9e est une heure ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension, par cons\u00e9quent, si un employ\u00e9 travaille moins d\u2019heures, il obtient moins de prestations de retraite. Toutes les contributions d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 sa pension sont reproduites par l\u2019employeur. Les autres avantages sont aussi fond\u00e9s sur du travail \u00e0 temps plein de 37,5 heures par semaine, qui correspond \u00e0 100 %, et par cons\u00e9quent, le travail \u00e0 temps partiel entra\u00eene normalement un calcul au prorata de ces avantages.\n[136] M. Star a confirm\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel re\u00e7oivent un salaire moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019ils travaillent. Il a aussi parl\u00e9 d\u2019une entente de travail \u00e0 temps partiel que la gestion demandait aux employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel de signer, dont le contenu indique essentiellement qu\u2019en signant, l\u2019employ\u00e9 accepte d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un horaire \u00e0 temps partiel. Cette entente \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 en place au moment de la plainte et est toujours utilis\u00e9e. Lorsque M. Star \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sentant syndical \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif, il recommandait aux employ\u00e9s de ne pas signer l\u2019entente, parce que son libell\u00e9 laisse entendre qu\u2019elle vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher l\u2019employ\u00e9 de retourner \u00e0 temps plein. Le syndicat s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait que dans le cas d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui est forc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9duire ses heures, tel que Mme Johnstone, la signature d\u2019une telle entente pourrait l\u2019emp\u00eacher de retourner aux quarts de travail \u00e0 plein temps si sa situation change. Aucune preuve ne d\u00e9montre que quiconque a refus\u00e9 de signer l\u2019entente en a subi des r\u00e9percussions, mais le fait que la gestion pr\u00e9sentait l\u2019entente donnait \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 l\u2019impression qu\u2019il devait signer \u00e0 titre de condition d\u2019emploi.\n[137] M. Star a aussi confirm\u00e9 que rien dans l\u2019EPHV ne pr\u00e9cise un nombre maximal d\u2019heures qui peuvent \u00eatre travaill\u00e9es par un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel ou ne limite le temps partiel \u00e0 34 heures par semaine.\nC. Le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert de Mme Linda Duxbury [138] Mme Linda Duxbury est qualifi\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019experte en gestion strat\u00e9gique des ressources humaines, y compris le profil d\u00e9mographique de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, la gestion du changement et les r\u00e9percussions de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle sur les employ\u00e9s. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a accept\u00e9 que Mme Duxbury soit qualifi\u00e9e d\u2019experte dans ces domaines.\n[139] Mme Duxbury a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un rapport \u00e9crit portant sur les besoins d\u2019accommodement des employ\u00e9s qui ont des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales ainsi que sur la nature et les r\u00e9percussions de toute r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019employeur quant aux mesures d\u2019adaptation prises pour ces besoins. Pour pr\u00e9parer son rapport, Mme Duxbury a lu l\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des deux parties.\n[140] MmeDuxbury est une professeure permanente \u00e0 la Sprott School of Business de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Carleton, o\u00f9 elle enseigne et supervise des cours de ma\u00eetrise et de doctorat sur des sujets tels que le comportement organisationnel, les questions d\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle et la gestion du changement pour les employ\u00e9s. Elle a aussi \u00e9crit des articles sur la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019attribution (le besoin essentiel de comprendre et d\u2019expliquer les causes du comportement d\u2019autrui) et la gestion des structures organisationnelles afin de maximiser le rendement des employ\u00e9s.\n[141] De plus, Mme Duxbury effectue de la recherche, participe \u00e0 des consultations et \u00e9crit des articles dans son domaine. Ses principaux domaines de recherche comprennent la gestion du [Traduction] c\u00f4t\u00e9 humain du changement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les r\u00e9percussions et les effets de changements dans le milieu du travail sur les employ\u00e9s, ainsi que les donn\u00e9es d\u00e9mographiques de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle du point de vue strat\u00e9gique. Mme Duxbury effectue de la recherche dans ce domaine depuis 20 ans et elle a consult\u00e9 tant le secteur priv\u00e9 que le secteur public \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[142] Le travail et les bases de donn\u00e9es des conclusions de Mme Duxbury sont reconnus et cit\u00e9s partout dans le monde. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 Google Scholar, qui est un site Web o\u00f9 seules les publications recommand\u00e9es par des professeurs et r\u00e9vis\u00e9es par les pairs sont affich\u00e9es. Les recherches de Mme Duxbury et de ses coll\u00e8gues sont cit\u00e9es sous [Traduction] Citation importantes sur ce site Web. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de Google Scholar.\n[143] L\u2019un des points importants du rapport et du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Duxbury portait sur la [Traduction] surcharge de responsabilit\u00e9s, o\u00f9 le travail interf\u00e8re avec les obligations familiales, ou les obligations familiales interf\u00e8rent avec le travail, au point o\u00f9 l\u2019individu ressent le stress de ne jamais avoir suffisamment de temps et que les t\u00e2ches en cours ne sont jamais termin\u00e9es.\n[144] [Traduction] Le travail interf\u00e8re avec la famille est le descripteur utilis\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019un employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e8re psychologiquement le temps qu\u2019il passe au travail au temps qu\u2019il passe \u00e0 s\u2019occuper de ses obligations familiales.\n[145] [Traduction] La famille interf\u00e8re avec le travail est le descripteur utilis\u00e9 lorsque l\u2019employ\u00e9 sacrifiera le travail pour ses obligations familiales, par exemple il refusera une promotion, travaillera \u00e0 temps partiel, etc.\n[146] Mme Duxbury a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la culture du milieu de travail est un indicateur dominant quant \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019employ\u00e9 sent ou non qu\u2019il a le contr\u00f4le de sa famille et de son travail. Il importe que la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de garde corresponde aux exigences du travail, parce que l\u2019employ\u00e9 ressent alors moins de stress si les deux sph\u00e8res peuvent \u00eatre appari\u00e9es.\n[147] La culture du milieu de travail, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 du milieu de travail, n\u2019est pas d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le gestionnaire en termes d\u2019organigramme, mais plut\u00f4t en termes de temp\u00e9rament et d\u2019attitudes du gestionnaire imm\u00e9diat de l\u2019employ\u00e9, la personne de qui l\u2019employ\u00e9 rel\u00e8ve. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Duxbury, la culture et les demandes du travail sont les [Traduction] deux grands facteurs qui ont des r\u00e9percussions sur le [Traduction] travail interf\u00e8re avec la famille dans la surcharge de responsabilit\u00e9s.\n[148] Un bon gestionnaire attire la loyaut\u00e9 de son \u00e9quipe, mais un mauvais gestionnaire qui en demande trop et qui est antipathique entra\u00eene le stress et la ranc\u0153ur, parce que l\u2019employ\u00e9 se sent comme s\u2019il n\u2019est pas entendu et n\u2019est pas appr\u00e9ci\u00e9.\n[149] Il y a eu une augmentation ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nale au Canada des femmes dans le milieu du travail et, pr\u00e9sentement, les deux tiers des familles canadiennes sont compos\u00e9es de deux soutiens \u00e9conomiques du m\u00e9nage. Il s\u2019agit maintenant du [Traduction] mode de fonctionnement des m\u00e9nages ou de la norme au Canada. Il y a aussi plus de chefs de familles monoparentales qui travaillent dans la population active que d\u2019hommes qui travaillent et dont l\u2019\u00e9pouse reste \u00e0 la maison. Normalement, ces hommes gagnent plus que la famille qui suit la norme.\n[150] Quinze pour cent de la population active, principalement des familles \u00e0 deux revenus, a de jeunes enfants. Les jeunes enfants, d\u00e9finis comme les enfants de 5 ans et moins, augmentent le fardeau des parents et r\u00e9duisent leur capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 choisir des quarts de travail variables.\n[151] Mme Duxbury a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a souvent un d\u00e9saccord entre les politiques et la pratique en milieu de travail. La pratique est la culture du milieu de travail, l\u2019exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9elle de l\u2019employ\u00e9. En termes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que de nombreuses organisations ont l\u2019impression qu\u2019elles ont [Traduction] fait leur part en mettant en place des politiques de premier ordre, mais qu\u2019elles ne font pas de suivi sur leur application.\n[152] Un des exemples que Mme Duxbury a donn\u00e9 est le [Traduction] t\u00e9l\u00e9travail. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe une excellente politique du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail, mais qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 peu d\u2019employ\u00e9s en prennent avantage, autrement qu\u2019en dehors des heures du travail, parce que le t\u00e9l\u00e9travail n\u2019est pas encourag\u00e9 par les employeurs du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[153] Quant aux op\u00e9rations 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, les horaires de travail et les accommodements doivent \u00eatre personnalis\u00e9s pour correspondre au milieu du travail, mais Mme Duxbury est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il existe tr\u00e8s peu d\u2019op\u00e9rations o\u00f9 il est impossible d\u2019avoir une certaine souplesse si la gestion est pr\u00eate \u00e0 appliquer cette souplesse.\n[154] Mme Duxbury a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que le travail par quart est un des principaux indicateurs de l\u2019augmentation ph\u00e9nom\u00e9nale des employ\u00e9s dans la cat\u00e9gorie du [Traduction] travail qui interf\u00e8re avec la famille et qui peut devenir tr\u00e8s probl\u00e9matique.\n[155] Les femmes ressentent en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral beaucoup de ces tensions concurrentielles, mais comme la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration plus jeune d\u2019employ\u00e9s masculins souhaite participer de plus en plus \u00e0 la vie familiale, les hommes ressentent de plus en plus les r\u00e9percussions de ces tensions aussi. Plus la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nie cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9, plus il devient difficile d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre de fa\u00e7on saine.\n[156] D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Duxbury, les donn\u00e9es sont claires : la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un horaire fixe permet \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tablir son r\u00e9seau de soutien de fa\u00e7on efficace. Comme le Canada se dirige vers un march\u00e9 favorable \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 (plus d\u2019emplois disponibles qu\u2019il n\u2019y a d\u2019employ\u00e9s pour combler les postes), Mme Duxbury se demande comment les employeurs peuvent se permettre de ne pas prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour les employ\u00e9s qui ont de jeunes enfants, compte tenu des changements d\u00e9mographiques dans notre pays.\n[157] Le taux de fertilit\u00e9 du Canada est dangereusement bas, \u00e0 1,5. Le taux de fertilit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre de 2,1 pour que le pays puisse se suffire \u00e0 lui-m\u00eame et grandir. Pendant le baby-boom apr\u00e8s la Seconde Guerre mondiale, le taux de fertilit\u00e9 du Canada \u00e9tait de 4. Cette diminution entra\u00eenera un manque flagrant de personnel au cours des 25 prochaines ann\u00e9es.\n[158] Le Canadien moyen entre sur le march\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 25 ans. La femme professionnelle canadienne moyenne a son premier enfant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 31 ans. Cet \u00e2ge plus avanc\u00e9 est un facteur dans le nombre de naissances, en raison de probl\u00e8mes de fertilit\u00e9 et du temps disponible.\n[159] Mme Duxbury a observ\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral dans son t\u00e9moignage que le recrutement, la r\u00e9tention et la planification de la rel\u00e8ve sont devenues des questions cruciales pour le gouvernement canadien et les entreprises. Dans un march\u00e9 favorable aux employ\u00e9s, le manque d\u2019accommodement cr\u00e9e un d\u00e9fi r\u00e9el pour le recrutement, la r\u00e9tention et la planification. Mme Duxbury est d\u2019avis que le fait de ne rien faire \u00e0 ce sujet a un co\u00fbt r\u00e9el qui ne fait qu\u2019augmenter.\n[160] D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Duxbury, les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au fait qu\u2019une entreprise ne tient pas compte de ces r\u00e9alit\u00e9s d\u00e9mographiques, le changement d\u2019attitude envers l\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle et les r\u00e9percussions sur les employ\u00e9s qui tentent de g\u00e9rer des demandes contradictoires entra\u00eenent une main d\u2019\u0153uvre o\u00f9 :\nles employ\u00e9s sont surcharg\u00e9s, surmen\u00e9s, stress\u00e9s, d\u00e9prim\u00e9s et ont plus de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale; l\u2019absent\u00e9isme augmente en raison de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9puisement; les employ\u00e9s sont moins engag\u00e9s, moins loyaux et moins satisfaits; l\u2019utilisation de m\u00e9dicaments sur ordonnance augmente; les employ\u00e9s sont moins engag\u00e9s et sont moins satisfaits de leur travail; les taux de roulement augmentent; le public obtient de moins bons services parce que les employ\u00e9s en font le moins possible; de plus en plus d\u2019employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9voient quitter leur emploi en raison de leurs demandes familiales et d\u2019un sentiment de ne pas \u00eatre appr\u00e9ci\u00e9s.\n[161] L\u2019avantage r\u00e9el pour un employeur qui prend des mesures d\u2019adaptation est qu\u2019il renverse les tendances susmentionn\u00e9es. Mme Duxbury a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si un employ\u00e9 est en bonne sant\u00e9 mentale et physique, qu\u2019il dort suffisamment et qu\u2019il se sent appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 au travail, on peut supposer qu\u2019un tel employ\u00e9 sera plus productif et aura un meilleur rendement.\n[162] Mme Duxbury a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le fait de se sentir appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 est tr\u00e8s important au travail. Nous comprenons facilement la notion de gestion du capital financier, mais pas celle du capital humain. Un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite contribuer doit se sentir valoris\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire reconnu et appr\u00e9ci\u00e9. Autrement, cet employ\u00e9 ne donnera pas \u00e0 l\u2019employeur l\u2019avantage de ses capacit\u00e9s.\n[163] Lorsqu\u2019un employeur est r\u00e9ceptif aux pr\u00e9occupations de son effectif, il est important d\u2019\u00e9duquer le reste des employ\u00e9s pour qu\u2019ils soient sensibilis\u00e9s au fait que tout avantage ajout\u00e9 ou accommodement per\u00e7u qu\u2019un autre employ\u00e9 a pu recevoir \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 peut leur \u00eatre accord\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019ils en auront besoin. Pour \u00e9duquer, l\u2019employeur doit avoir en place des politiques non \u00e9quivoques, transparentes et qui comprennent une attribution de responsabilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9d\u00e9finie relativement \u00e0 l\u2019utilisation abusive. De telles d\u00e9marches d\u2019\u00e9ducation entra\u00eenent un changement d\u2019attitude.\n[164] Mme Duxbury a bien soulign\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que les donn\u00e9es sont sans \u00e9quivoque : une personne utilisera moins les soins m\u00e9dicaux et les professionnels de la sant\u00e9 si les questions d\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle sont trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on favorable. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [Traduction] la principale m\u00e9thode d\u2019adaptation au Canada est de r\u00e9duire les heures de sommeil. Les m\u00e9thodes suivantes sont la boisson, la cigarette, la malnutrition et le manque d\u2019exercice \u2013 qui ont toutes des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives sur la sant\u00e9.\n[165] L\u2019avocat de la CCDP a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Duxbury si la crainte qui rel\u00e8ve de l\u2019impression d\u2019une organisation au sujet d\u2019un grand nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s demandant la m\u00eame mesure d\u2019adaptation est fond\u00e9e. Elle a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative, parce que l\u2019effectif est constitu\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes personnes qui en sont \u00e0 des cycles de vie diff\u00e9rents et qui ont des besoins diff\u00e9rents en tout temps. Mme Duxbury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son exp\u00e9rience montre que les employ\u00e9s utiliseront g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les mesures d\u2019adaptation dont ils ont besoin et n\u2019en abuseront pas. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, on [Traduction] ne fait pas assez confiance aux autres.\n[166] Comme les femmes constituent 47 % de la population active actuelle du Canada, Mme Duxbury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si des mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u2019\u00e9taient pas prises pour les femmes qui travaillent alors que leurs enfants sont jeunes, de moins en moins de femmes resteront au travail, ou bien la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 souffrira de leur choix d\u2019avoir moins d\u2019enfants ou de ne pas en avoir du tout.\n[167] En contre-interrogatoire, on a dout\u00e9 de l\u2019application des statistiques des bases de donn\u00e9es de Mme Duxbury \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait clair que les donn\u00e9es de Mme Duxbury provenaient d\u2019une vaste gamme d\u2019employ\u00e9s de tous les secteurs dans de nombreux emplois et postes, \u00e0 qui on a pos\u00e9 une grande vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de questions qui portaient sur le milieu de travail m\u00eame et sur les attitudes envers le milieu de travail.\n[168] De plus, Mme Duxbury a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne donnait pas entendre qu\u2019il fallait r\u00e9compenser les mauvais employ\u00e9s, mais plut\u00f4t que les bons gestionnaires et les bons employeurs qui ne cloisonnent pas les groupes d\u2019employ\u00e9s les uns des autres en tirent avantage. Elle a soutenu que le fait de traiter chaque employ\u00e9 de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessairement de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, parce que les besoins et les gens ne sont pas les m\u00eames. Une certaine souplesse et une \u00e9valuation individuelle est appropri\u00e9e et g\u00e9rable.\n[169] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, Mme Duxbury a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que comme cadre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de travail, la bonne gestion et une culture de soutien en milieu de travail est une combinaison gagnante tant pour les employeurs que les employ\u00e9s.\n[170] Dans le contexte d\u2019un milieu de travail par quarts de travail rotatifs, Mme Duxbury reconna\u00eet que les quarts de travail de ce type sont plus probl\u00e9matiques pour les employ\u00e9s, cependant, une partie de l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre palli\u00e9e par un pr\u00e9avis suffisant et la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9changer des quarts de travail avec des coll\u00e8gues. Cela augmente le sentiment de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019employ\u00e9 et sa capacit\u00e9 de se cr\u00e9er un r\u00e9seau de soutien. Elle a aussi not\u00e9 que le quart de travail qu\u2019un employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e8re aujourd\u2019hui ne sera peut-\u00eatre pas le m\u00eame quart de travail qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rera dans deux ans, parce que les besoins et les demandes d\u2019une personne changent avec le temps. La totalit\u00e9 de la preuve de Mme Duxbury a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement applicable au milieu de travail de l\u2019ASFC, mais elle n\u2019a pas observ\u00e9 personnellement ce milieu de travail particulier et n\u2019a pas tir\u00e9 de conclusions \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[171] Mme Duxbury a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il est na\u00eff d\u2019affirmer (comme l\u2019intim\u00e9e le fait) que les questions de responsabilit\u00e9s parentales sont uniquement un r\u00e9sultat du choix de l\u2019employ\u00e9, alors que l\u2019employ\u00e9 fait face aux besoins de fournir une maison et de la nourriture \u00e0 sa famille. Mme Duxbury a pos\u00e9 la question de pure forme suivante : bien que th\u00e9oriquement, une personne ait le choix, \u00e0 quel point ce choix est\u2011il r\u00e9el s\u2019il n\u2019y a qu\u2019une seule option acceptable l\u00e9galement et moralement ? La pr\u00e9misse de Mme Duxbury est qu\u2019une personne ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 choisir entre fonder une famille et occuper un emploi significatif pour lequel elle est form\u00e9e et a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer cet emploi. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, les pires employeurs sont ceux qui disent respecter l\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle, mais qui ne le font pas r\u00e9ellement.\n[172] Mme Duxbury a laiss\u00e9 entendre que si un employeur met en place des politiques fonctionnelles, compr\u00e9hensibles et \u00e9quitables, il revient alors \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 de les utiliser. La culture du milieu de travail est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019observation de l\u2019environnement r\u00e9el et cette culture, le gestionnaire imm\u00e9diat de l\u2019employ\u00e9 et la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une certaine flexibilit\u00e9 et pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 dans sa vie sont les meilleurs indicateurs de succ\u00e8s.\n[173] Le meilleur choix est d\u2019avoir des politiques en place et de donner aux gestionnaires l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de traiter individuellement avec leurs employ\u00e9s afin que le soutien soit tangible et r\u00e9ponde aux besoins de chacun. Mme Duxbury a ajout\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019une demande est accueillie, il est important que le gestionnaire communique aux autres employ\u00e9s la raison pour laquelle il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une bonne d\u00e9cision. [Traduction] En l\u2019absence de transparence, on suppose qu\u2019il y a eu favoritisme.\nD. Le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert de Martha Friendly [174] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que Martha Friendly soit qualifi\u00e9e comme experte sur les politiques en mati\u00e8re de services de garde au Canada, y compris la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de garde pour les personnes qui travaillent pendant des quarts de travail rotatifs et changeants de fa\u00e7on irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re. L\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette qualification au motif que Mme Friendly n\u2019a pas personnellement effectu\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes concr\u00e8tes, mais a seulement examin\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es disponibles, qui ne sont pas abondantes et qui ne sont pas r\u00e9centes. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e que Mme Friendly soit accept\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 titre d\u2019experte sur les politiques en mati\u00e8re de services de garde au Canada. En acceptant la qualification de Mme Friendy \u00e0 titre d\u2019experte comme la plaignante l\u2019a demand\u00e9, le Tribunal a relev\u00e9 dans la description de la longue carri\u00e8re en \u00e9criture et en enseignement de Mme Friendly qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de une connaissance g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de garde, tant traditionnels que non traditionnels, au Canada pour les employ\u00e9s canadiens et qu\u2019elle poss\u00e8de des connaissances au sujet des facteurs qui affectent les femmes dans la population active, y compris les r\u00e9percussions que la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de garde a sur les femmes canadiennes qui travaillent. Le Tribunal a conclu que toute pr\u00e9occupation que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait que Mme Friendly se fonde sur des donn\u00e9es insuffisantes ou trop vieilles pouvait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e en contre-interrogatoire.\n[175] Mme Friendly est la directrice ex\u00e9cutive de la Childcare Resource and Research Unit (CRRU) \u00e0 Toronto (Ontario). La CCRU est un \u00e9tablissement de recherche en mati\u00e8re de politiques ax\u00e9e sur les politiques en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e0 la petite enfance, de services de garde et de la famille. Elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un rapport \u00e9crit au sujet de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 des services de garde pour des parents qui travaillent pendant des heures impr\u00e9visibles, rotatives et hors norme. L\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que Mme Johnstone avait plus d\u2019options en mati\u00e8re de service de garde qu\u2019elle le donnait \u00e0 entendre et le rapport de Mme Friendly a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question. Pour pr\u00e9parer son rapport, Mme Friendly a aussi examin\u00e9 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des deux parties.\n[176] Pendant plus de 30 ans, la CCRU a fait partie de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Toronto, mais en 2007, elle est devenue un organisme \u00e0 but non lucratif distinct qui re\u00e7oit du financement provincial et f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Mme Friendly est une sp\u00e9cialiste en politiques portant sur l\u2019\u00e9ducation \u00e0 la petite enfance et sur les services de garde. Elle fait aussi partie d\u2019un groupe international de recherche et d\u2019analyse sur les politques de services de garde qui \u00e9crit des articles sur des sujets qui portent sur sa sp\u00e9cialisation. Elle a publi\u00e9 des \u00e9crits dans son domaine et elle enseigne au programme de ma\u00eetrise de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Ryerson.\n[177] Bien que son t\u00e9moignage ait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que Mme Friendly encourage l\u2019augmentation du financement public pour les services de garde, la partie importante pour l\u2019audience portait sur sa connaissance de la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de garde au Canada et l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas laiss\u00e9 entendre que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait influenc\u00e9 par ses points de vue en mati\u00e8re de politiques.\n[178] L\u2019avocate de la plaignante a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Friendly visait \u00e0 informer le Tribunal des difficult\u00e9s r\u00e9elles auxquelles un p\u00e8re ou une m\u00e8re comme la plaignante fait face lorsqu\u2019il cherche des services de garde \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de sa famille, une difficult\u00e9 que rencontre aussi toute personne dans la position de la plaignante, qui a de jeunes enfants et dont l\u2019emploi n\u00e9cessite du travail par quarts rotatifs, changeants et impr\u00e9visibles. Le Tribunal a conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Friendly \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait fiable.\n[179] Dans son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Friendly a soulign\u00e9 que le facteur le plus difficile dans l\u2019accommodement des services de garde est l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9. De nombreux facteurs entrent en jeu dans la d\u00e9cision du choix de services de garde, mais l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019horaire d\u2019un employ\u00e9 rend presque impossible la possibilit\u00e9 de trouver un service de garde pay\u00e9, enregistr\u00e9 ou non enregistr\u00e9, dans un centre ou dans une maison priv\u00e9e.\n[180] Le deuxi\u00e8me facteur dans l\u2019ordre de difficult\u00e9 est le besoin d\u2019obtenir des heures prolong\u00e9es, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire des heures d\u00e9passant les heures normales du travail soit environ de 7 h \u00e0 18 h les jours de semaine. Le besoin d\u2019obtenir un service de garde la fin de semaine et, en particulier, la nuit, rend la chose pratiquement impossible.\n[181] De plus, Mme Friendly a not\u00e9 que les espaces disponibles en service de garde varient. Une \u00e9ducatrice qui a un service de garde dans sa propre maison, par exemple, peut d\u00e9cider de le fermer lorsque ses propres enfants sont d\u2019\u00e2ge scolaire. Cependant, d\u2019autres services de garde peuvent ouvrir alors qu\u2019auparavant, il n\u2019y en avait pas.\n[182] Comme Mme Friendly l\u2019explique, il n\u2019y a pas vraiment de donn\u00e9es sur les services de garde non enregistr\u00e9s au Canada, alors son t\u00e9moignage portait principalement sur les services de garde enregistr\u00e9s disponibles, qui comprennent les centres de la petite enfance et les service de garde en milieu familial suivant les r\u00e8glements provinciaux. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les centres de la petite enfance enregistr\u00e9s au Canada sont tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s et que par cons\u00e9quent, les services de garde non enregistr\u00e9s sont souvent utilis\u00e9s. En d\u2019autres mots, la demande d\u00e9passe largement l\u2019offre.\n[183] De la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, des donn\u00e9es fiables sur la disponibilit\u00e9 des heures \u00e9tendues en service de garde dans des milieux non enregistr\u00e9s ne sont pas non plus disponibles, mais le Tribunal peut accepter la preuve empirique \u00e0 ce sujet, appuy\u00e9e par la preuve directe de Mme Johnstone.\n[184] Mme Friendly a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des preuves au sujet de deux \u00e9tudes importantes effectu\u00e9es dans les ann\u00e9es 1990 sur la disponibilit\u00e9 des services de garde apr\u00e8s les heures. Les r\u00e9sultats de ces \u00e9tudes ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9, sans surprise, qu\u2019il y a (ou qu\u2019il y a eu) tr\u00e8s peu de programmes qui offrent des heures \u00e9tendues ou des services de garde la fin de semaine, mais que peu de gens utilisaient les services lors de la fin de semaine ou de la nuit et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas rentable de continuer \u00e0 offrir ces programmes.\n[185] Cela appuie le point de vue de Mme Johnstone selon lequel le type de service de garde dont elle avait besoin n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible, ou \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 trouver, et qu\u2019il y a relativement peu d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui ont besoin de service de garde de ce genre, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire qu\u2019il y a peu d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui ont des quarts de travail rotatifs changeants, avec des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires fr\u00e9quentes, qui sont aussi mari\u00e9s \u00e0 une personne qui a des quarts de travail semblables.\n[186] Si l\u2019on examine cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 au niveau suivant, conjointement avec la preuve directe de Mme Johnstone \u00e0 ce sujet, il y a peu d\u2019ASF qui auraient besoin de mesures d\u2019adaptation les exemptant de l\u2019EPHV pour obtenir des quarts de travail fixes pendant une certaine p\u00e9riode. La plupart des employ\u00e9s se tournent en premier vers leur \u00e9poux, leur famille et leurs amis pour les services de garde, et seulement lorsque ces options ne fonctionnent pas ou ne sont pas suffisantes, ils se tournent vers des services de garde offerts par des tiers. Mme Friendly, tout comme le Tribunal, est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est compr\u00e9hensible que la majorit\u00e9 des parents ne se sentent pas confortables de laisser leurs jeunes enfants passer la nuit dans un service de garde offert par un tiers.\n[187] Il est peu probable que Mme Johnstone, ou tout employ\u00e9 dans une situation semblable, puisse trouver un service de garde offert par un tiers, plut\u00f4t que par de la famille, qui soit pr\u00eat \u00e0 fournir des services de garde fiables pour de jeunes enfants selon un horaire impr\u00e9visible, m\u00eame si cet horaire est limit\u00e9 \u00e0 trois jours par semaine. Le fournisseur de services de garde a des heures pr\u00e9\u00e9tablies et a sa propre vie \u00e0 vivre, et m\u00eame la famille de l\u2019employ\u00e9 doit \u00eatre \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 de celui\u2011ci, par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019impr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 est un facteur extr\u00eamement n\u00e9gatif pour l\u2019obtention de services de garde.\n[188] En ayant recours \u00e0 des membres de sa famille pendant une p\u00e9riode de trois jours, m\u00eame si Mme Johnstone et son mari devaient transporter leurs enfants \u00e0 trois lieux diff\u00e9rents pendant ces jours, elle \u00e9tait en mesure de proposer \u00e0 son employeur sa disponibilit\u00e9 la plus souple possible \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 : travailler les m\u00eames trois jours par semaine, mais sans pr\u00e9ciser d\u2019heures de d\u00e9but, de lieux ou de dur\u00e9e de quarts de travail et la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler pendant des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et de remplir ses pleines fonctions d\u2019ASF.\n[189] Mme Friendly a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019obstacles en mati\u00e8re de financement et de co\u00fbts qui existent pour les familles canadiennes moyennes. Les p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 financ\u00e9es par le gouvernement se sont allong\u00e9es au cours des 30 derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, augmentant \u00e0 une ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te en 2003. Au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, les cr\u00e9dits d\u2019imp\u00f4t gouvernementaux et les prestations pour enfants ont aussi augment\u00e9 pour les familles. Ces cr\u00e9dits et prestations ont aid\u00e9 les familles et ils ne sont pas offerts dans tous le pays, comme les \u00c9tats-Unis. Par cons\u00e9quent, les donn\u00e9es des \u00c9tats-Unis \u00e0 ce sujet ne sont pas fiables lorsqu\u2019on applique la question au Canada.\n[190] De plus, des subventions sont disponibles pour les familles \u00e0 faible revenu (seulement si des services de garde enregistr\u00e9s sont utilis\u00e9s), mais ne sont pas offerts aux familles \u00e0 revenu moyen. La majorit\u00e9 des familles canadiennes, y compris celle de Mme Johnstone, fait partie de la cat\u00e9gorie du revenu moyen par d\u00e9finition et ce sont ces familles qui ont de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 payer pour des services de garde offerts par des tiers, mais qui ont un trop gros revenu pour pouvoir obtenir des subventions.\n[191] Mme Friendly a cit\u00e9 l\u2019une des principales expertes am\u00e9ricaines dans son domaine, Harriet Presser (une d\u00e9mographe \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Harvard), qui a \u00e9crit un livre en 2003 \u00e0 ce sujet. MmePresser a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il est [Traduction] rare que deux personnes dans un couple travaillent pendant des quarts de travail impr\u00e9visibles et que la majorit\u00e9 des couples s\u2019organisent principalement entre \u00e9poux et avec l\u2019aide de leurs familles. Mme Presser a \u00e9crit de nombreux articles dans ce domaine et a invent\u00e9 l\u2019expression [Traduction] personnes \u00e0 vie de famille fractionn\u00e9e, pour les couples \u00e0 deux revenus qui travaillent pendant des quarts diff\u00e9rents afin de pouvoir satisfaire leurs besoins en services de garde.\n[192] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019ASFC a pos\u00e9 de nombreuses questions \u00e0 Mme Friendly en contre\u2011interrogatoire au sujet des nombreux facteurs qui entrent en compte dans la d\u00e9cision d\u2019une personne d\u2019obtenir des services de garde offerts par un tiers. Mme Friendly a reconnu que de nombreux facteurs entrent en compte dans un tel choix, y compris le co\u00fbt, le type de service, le lieu, la disponibilit\u00e9, la qualit\u00e9 et la confiance que la personne ressent envers le fournisseur de service. Le type de quart de travail et le nombre d\u2019heures travaill\u00e9es ne sont pas les seuls facteurs d\u00e9terminants.\n[193] Bien qu\u2019il semble \u00e9vident que de nombreux facteurs entrent en compte dans les choix individuels, la plainte porte sur une situation o\u00f9 il n\u2019y avait pas de services de garde offerts par un tiers disponibles pour les heures o\u00f9 Mme Johnstone travaillait et ni son \u00e9poux, ni d\u2019autres membres de sa famille ne pouvaient combler l\u2019\u00e9cart compl\u00e8tement.\n[194] Dans une telle situation, la personne doit soit tenter d\u2019obtenir des mesures d\u2019adaptation aupr\u00e8s de son employeur, soit quitter son emploi chez cet employeur (option que Mme Duxbury a expliqu\u00e9e dans son t\u00e9moignage). Mme Johnstone souhaitait \u00e9tablir une carri\u00e8re \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC. Elle avait investi du temps, elle avait suivi des formations sp\u00e9ciales pour son poste et elle aimait son travail. Ses \u00e9valuations de rendement et sa propre \u00e9valuation de son travail montrent qu\u2019elle faisait bien son travail. Il ne semble pas d\u00e9raisonnable au Tribunal que Mme Johnstone souhaite garder son emploi \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC et demande des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour son horaire par quarts de travail jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ses enfants soient d\u2019\u00e2ge scolaire, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 5 ou 6 ans.\n[195] Finalement, Mme Friendly a confirm\u00e9 que la personne qui cherche un service de garde convenable offert par un tiers fait face \u00e0 un spectre de difficult\u00e9s qui d\u00e9pend de ses besoins particuliers. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la situation de Mme Johnstone \u00e9tait [Traduction] l\u2019une des situations de service de garde les plus difficiles qu\u2019elle puisse imaginer en raison des facteurs suivants : des quarts de travail diff\u00e9rents \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes heures et \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents jours, y compris la fin de semaine; les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires; les quarts de travail \u00e0 toute heure du jour ou de la nuit; et le fait que son \u00e9poux avait le m\u00eame type d\u2019horaire de travail qu\u2019elle.\nE. La preuve prima facie [196] Le crit\u00e8re pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Martin c. Gouvernement de la bande Saulteaux, (2002) CanLII 23560 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 24 (Martin) et dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpson-Sears (O\u2019Malley), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28.\n[197] Essentiellement, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de Mme Johnstone, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Si le Tribunal conclue que la preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie, il incombe alors \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer que, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination, elle d\u00e9coulait d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es et que l\u2019accommodement des personnes affect\u00e9es imposerait une contrainte excessive \u00e0 l\u2019employeur.\n[198] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, les deux questions dont le Tribunal est saisi sont :\nL\u2019ASFC a-t-elle commis un acte discriminatoire, par des moyens directs ou indirects b) en d\u00e9favorisant Mme Johnstone en cours d\u2019emploi pour le motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille?\nL\u2019ASFC a-t-elle commis un acte discriminatoire en fixant ou en appliquant des lignes de conduite ou en concluant des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l\u2019engagement, les promotions, la formation, l\u2019apprentissage, la mutation ou tout autre aspect de l\u2019emploi qui \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement de Mme Johnstone en raison du motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille?\n[199] Habituellement, pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant doit simplement d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une politique a eu des r\u00e9percussions discriminatoires envers lui en raison d\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique personnelle qui est reconnue comme motif de distinction illicite. Morris c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [2005] A.C.F. no 731, aux paragraphes 27 et 28 (Morris).\n[200] Dans la pr\u00e9sente instruction, le motif de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est la situation de famille. Les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille au sens des articles 3, 7 et 10 de la LCDP et, par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal doit traiter de la signification de l\u2019expression situation de famille avant de pouvoir d\u00e9cider si la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une preuve prima facie.\n[201] De plus, l\u2019ASFC et d\u2019avis que le motif de situation de famille entra\u00eene un fardeau de preuve plus lourd pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie que les autres motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP. Au soutien de cette th\u00e8se, l\u2019ASFC se fonde sur l\u2019affaire Health Sciences Association of British Columbia c. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] D.C.D.P. no 33 (Campbell River), et sur les d\u00e9cisions des tribunaux des droits de la personne provinciaux et des arbitres f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui ont suivi l\u2019approche de la d\u00e9cision Campbell River \u00e0 ce sujet.\nLa situation de famille\n[202] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de l\u2019expression situation de famille utilis\u00e9e dans la LCDP, Mme Johnstone cite les d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du TCDP dans Brown analys\u00e9es \u00e0 la section IV ci\u2011dessus, et Wolden c. Lynn, [2002], D.C.D.P no 18 (Wolden).\n[203] Les faits dans la d\u00e9cision Brown sont tr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 ceux en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Brown \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de l\u2019ASFC. Le TCDP a conclu que la plainte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Brown et, pour tirer cette conclusion, il a examin\u00e9 la nature de la situation de famille.\n[204] \u00c0 la page 14 de la d\u00e9cision Brown, le Tribunal a d\u00e9fini le motif de la situation de famille comme suit :\n\u2026la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d\u2019\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations.\n[205] Aux pages 18 et 19 de la d\u00e9cision Brown, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le motif de situation de famille comprenait :\n\u2026 [les] obligations ainsi que [les] devoirs au sein de la famille et l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 2 de la LCDP en fonction de son objet consiste \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre clairement, dans le contexte de la situation de famille, le droit et l\u2019obligation du parent de chercher \u00e0 atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre ainsi que l\u2019obligation manifeste pour l\u2019employeur d\u2019aider le parent \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Alberta Dairy Pool. Une interpr\u00e9tation moins s\u00e9rieuse des probl\u00e8mes auxquels la famille moderne fait face dans le milieu de travail enl\u00e8verait tout son sens au concept de la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination.\n[206] Mme Johnstone soutient qu\u2019il est bien \u00e9tabli que l\u2019objectif de l\u2019ensemble des lois sur les droits de la personne est de prot\u00e9ger et de consacrer les droits et la dignit\u00e9 des Canadiens. Par cons\u00e9quent, les codes des droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale.\n[207] Mme Johnstone se fonde aussi sur l\u2019arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [2002] A.C.S. no 67 (B. c. Ontario) aux paragraphes 44 et 45, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 que pour \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il a subi un acte discriminatoire, un plaignant qui se fonde sur la situation de famille n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 arbitrairement d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en raison de son \u00e9tat [\u2026] familial. En d\u2019autres mots, la Cour supr\u00eame a adopt\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation large et lib\u00e9rale de la LCDP.\n[208] Mme Johnstone accepte que l\u2019obligation familiale en question doive \u00eatre importante, cependant, une fois cette conclusion tir\u00e9e, alors l\u2019interf\u00e9rence avec cette obligation est suffisante pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\n[209] Mme Johnstone a aussi mentionn\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Hoyt c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2006] D.C.D.P. no 33 (Hoyt). Dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, la plaignante travaillait dans le domaine des chemins de fer et avait demand\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019accommodement \u00e0 son employeur pour pouvoir travailler pendant un quart de travail en particulier qui lui permettrait de s\u2019organiser pour trouver des services de garde pour son enfant. Une fois de plus, le TCDP a accept\u00e9 que la port\u00e9e de la situation de famille comprenait les obligations parentales de la m\u00eame nature que celles de Mme Johnstone.\n[210] L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de situation de famille au sens de la LCDP comme comprenant les obligations familiales et parentales, dont les soins aux enfants, a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions :\nWight c. Ontario (Office of the Legislative Assembly), [1998] O.H.R.B.I.D. no 13 (Wight)\nCanada Post Corp. c. Canadian Union of Post Workers (Somerville Grievance, CUPW 790-03-00008, Arb.

Ontario Public Service Staff Union (DeFreitas Grievance), [2005] O.L.A.A. no 396, aux paragraphes 19 \u00e0 21\n[211] Le Tribunal note que m\u00eame la d\u00e9cision Campbell River et les d\u00e9cisions qui l\u2019ont suivie et ont adopt\u00e9 la m\u00eame approche acceptent tout de m\u00eame que les obligations en mati\u00e8re de service de garde font partie de la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille au sens de la LCDP. Le d\u00e9bat entre ces d\u00e9cisions et celles cit\u00e9es par Mme Johnstone porte sur le fardeau requis dans de tels cas pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie et non sur la signification de situation de famille.\n[212] La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans la d\u00e9cision Campbell River a renvers\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019arbitre \u00e0 ce sujet et a accept\u00e9 que les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales (dans cette affaire, une m\u00e8re qui doit prendre soin d\u2019un enfant qui a des troubles du comportement) font partie de la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille.\n[213] On peut dire la m\u00eame chose du contr\u00f4le judiciaire que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a effectu\u00e9 au sujet du rejet initial par la CCDP de la plainte de Mme Johnstone, mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 72 ci\u2011dessus. Le juge Barnes, en infirmant le rejet de la CCDP de la plainte de Mme Johnstone, ne s\u2019est pas formalis\u00e9 que la plainte tomb\u00e2t sous le coup de la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille au sens de la LCDP. Cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait ax\u00e9e sur une critique de l\u2019approche prise dans la s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions suivant Campbell River \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019atteinte est suffisante ou s\u2019il faut conclure qu\u2019il y a eu atteinte grave aux int\u00e9r\u00eats prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de la plaignante. Johnstone c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. no 43 (Johnstone)\n[214] L\u2019ASFC demande une interpr\u00e9tation plus restreinte en soutenant que le droit \u00e0 ce sujet est incertain.\n[215] L\u2019ASFC pr\u00e9tend que la protection de la LCDP ne s\u2019\u00e9tend pas aux obligations familiales parce que seules les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e9tat au sens absolu d\u2019une personne en tant que membre d\u2019une famille constitue la situation de famille dans la LCDP. L\u2019ASFC nie que la protection s\u2019\u00e9tend aux activit\u00e9s ou aux responsabilit\u00e9s li\u00e9es au statut d\u2019une personne \u00e0 titre de p\u00e8re ou de m\u00e8re.\n[216] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a trait\u00e9 de l\u2019expression statut comme comprenant la participation \u00e0 titre de membre dans une cat\u00e9gorie ou un groupe et incluant tant la d\u00e9finition absolue que la d\u00e9finition relative de l\u2019existence ou de l\u2019absence d\u2019une relation avec une autre personne. La d\u00e9cision traitait aussi du d\u00e9savantage arbitraire subi, mais ne donnait pas de d\u00e9finition exhaustive de la situation de famille au sens du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario, qui est une loi provinciale semblable \u00e0 la loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Au paragraphe 57 de l\u2019arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame a parl\u00e9 d\u2019une personne \u00e0 qui on a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 un traitement diff\u00e9rent pour l\u2019un des motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[217] L\u2019ASFC incite le Tribunal \u00e0 ne pas suivre les d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du TCDP dans Brown, Wolden et Hoyt. L\u2019ASFC demande au Tribunal d\u2019adopter une interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique qui ne va pas au\u2011del\u00e0 de l\u2019objet v\u00e9ritable du droit ou de la libert\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Big M Drug Mart, [1985] 1 R.C.S. 295, paragraphe 117.\n[218] L\u2019ASFC met le Tribunal en garde contre les p\u00e9rils d\u2019une approche qui pr\u00e9sume que tout conflit entre les obligations du travail et les obligations familiales constitue de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de situation de famille. \u00c0 cet effet, l\u2019ASFC cite l\u2019affaire Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] A.C.S. no 4, au paragraphe 49, motifs de la juge Abella (McGill), pour soutenir que la situation de famille ne devrait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 favoriser et \u00e0 promouvoir un arrangement familial en particulier, parce que ce ne sont pas toutes les situations qui se verront accorder une protection, seulement celles qui sont r\u00e9ellement discriminatoires.\n[219] Le Tribunal ne conclut pas que la d\u00e9claration de la juge Abella entre en conflit avec la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Johnstone.\n[220] Le Tribunal accepte que ce ne sont pas toutes les tensions qui ont lieu dans le contexte de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie-personnelle qui peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es par la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, mais ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019argument qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. L\u2019argument de Mme Johnstone est qu\u2019une telle protection devrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e lorsque appropri\u00e9e et raisonnable, compte tenu des circonstances pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[221] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, nous traitons ici du cas d\u2019une vraie personne qui a des obligations envers ses jeunes enfants et des r\u00e9percussions importantes sur la capacit\u00e9 de cette personne de remplir cette obligation. Il ne revient pas au Tribunal de traiter de toutes les obligations familiales et de tous les conflits entre le travail d\u2019un employ\u00e9 et ses obligations.\n[222] L\u2019ASFC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans ses observations des renseignements sur l\u2019historique du motif de situation de famille compris dans la LCDP et dans les codes des droits de personne provinciaux, en y incluant une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au Hansard citant le discours du ministre de la Justice d\u2019alors, le 20 d\u00e9cembre 1982. Le ministre de la Justice, il y a 27 ans, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019inclusion de la situation de famille signifie que vous ne pouvez pas \u00eatre coupable par association et que l\u2019on ne peut pas refuser un emploi \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un parce que quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre de sa famille a une faiblesse quelconque. On ne peut donc pas invoquer cela pour refuser un emploi \u00e0 quelqu\u2019un. Chaque personne doit \u00eatre jug\u00e9e sur ses propres m\u00e9rites et comp\u00e9tences, et non pas sur sa situation de famille.\n[223] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid, 2005 CSC 30, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a appliqu\u00e9 l\u2019approche moderne d\u2019Elmer Driedger \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des lois, en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la 2e \u00e9dition de son livre Construction of Statutes. Cette approche pr\u00e9cise que : [Traduction] Aujourd\u2019hui, il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un seul principe ou solution : il faut lire les termes d\u2019une loi dans leur contexte global en suivant le sens ordinaire et grammatical qui s\u2019harmonise avec l\u2019esprit de la loi, l\u2019objet de la loi et l\u2019intention du l\u00e9gislateur. En d\u2019autres mots, l\u2019 intention du l\u00e9gislateur suppos\u00e9e, dans la mesure o\u00f9 on peut la deviner dans les mots d\u2019un ministre, n\u2019est pas le seul facteur d\u00e9terminant. C\u2019est particuli\u00e8rement le cas lorsque le contexte et l\u2019esprit de la loi laissent entrevoir le contraire.\n[224] Lorsque le ministre a fait sa d\u00e9claration en 1982, sur laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e se fonde, l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement en emploi ne paraissait pas dans la LCDP. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, l\u2019expression la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins ne faisait pas partie de la disposition portant sur l\u2019objet de la LCDP (l\u2019article 2). L\u2019inclusion de cette notion dans la disposition portant sur l\u2019objet, de fa\u00e7on s\u00e9par\u00e9e et distincte de son inclusion \u00e0 l\u2019article 15, a permis d\u2019\u00e9largir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la LCDP afin que l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des occasions signifie maintenant plus que le fait de ne pas \u00eatre entrav\u00e9 par des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes ou des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s ( coupable par association ). Cela comprend le fait de tenir compte des besoins des gens. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la situation de famille ne devrait pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019identification d\u2019une personne \u00e0 titre de parent ou par rapport au lien familial avec une autre personne. Elle doit comprendre les besoins et les obligations qui d\u00e9coulent naturellement de cette relation.\n[225] Bien que le contexte historique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit un facteur, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas persuasif \u00e0 titre d\u2019explication exhaustive de la signification actuelle de situation de famille au sens de la LCDP, compte tenu des modifications \u00e0 la LCDP et de la jurisprudence d\u00e9velopp\u00e9e au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[226] L\u2019ASFC cite aussi le grief Whyte et le grief Simcoe Country District School Board and Ontario Public Service Employees Union, Local 330, (2002), 103 L.A.C. (4th) 309 (Griffith).\n[227] Dans Whyte, l\u2019employ\u00e9 avait enti\u00e8rement le fardeau de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 tout besoin associ\u00e9 avec le fait de travailler pour une compagnie qui fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, telle qu\u2019une compagnie de chemins de fer. La d\u00e9cision concluait que [Traduction] en \u00e9change pour leur acceptation de ces lourdes obligations, les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie de chemins de fer ont obtenu l\u2019avantage de salaires relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et de bons avantages sociaux. Cela laisse entendre que l\u2019employeur peut agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire, tant qu\u2019il paie bien ses employ\u00e9s, sans d\u00e9finition de ce que signifie relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux ou sans comparaison.\n[228] Dans Griffith, une personne qui souhaitait utiliser des cong\u00e9s de maladie pour quitter le travail plus t\u00f4t deux fois par semaine pour s\u2019occuper de son enfant a vu sa demande rejet\u00e9e. L\u2019arbitre a conclu que le refus de l\u2019employeur ne constituait pas de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille.\n[229] Le Tribunal ne trouve pas les d\u00e9cisions dans les griefs Whyte ou Griffith persuasives.\n[230] Les deux parties se fondent sur leur propre interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019article 2 de la LCDP en ce qui a trait \u00e0 leurs arguments, mais le Tribunal conclut que rien dans l\u2019article 2 ne cr\u00e9e une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive et \u00e9troite de la situation de famille.\n[231] Au contraire, l\u2019objectif sous-jacent de la LCDP, comme je l\u2019ai dit, est de fournir \u00e0 toute personne un m\u00e9canisme garantissant le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins [\u2026]. Il est raisonnable que les protections fournies comprennent celles d\u00e9coulant naturellement de l\u2019une des relations les plus fondamentales de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui existent, celles du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re envers son enfant. Le fait que le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 2 mentionne l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement prouve que la LCDP reconna\u00eet que les individus font des choix distincts, y compris celui d\u2019avoir des enfants, et que la LCDP prot\u00e8ge tous les individus contre la discrimination envers ces choix.\n[232] L\u2019ASFC se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [1988] A.C.F. (Schaap), une affaire qui portait sur la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial dans l\u2019attribution de logements militaires, et cite le juge Marceau \u00e0 la page 3 de cette d\u00e9cision dans ses observations finales. Le Tribunal a tir\u00e9 certaines des citations utilis\u00e9es par l\u2019ASFC et les interpr\u00e8te de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rente pour la plainte. Le juge Hugessen a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions doivent \u00eatre fond\u00e9es sur la valeur ou les qualit\u00e9s des individus et non sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes de groupe. Le juge Marceau a pour sa part \u00e9crit : Cette intention n\u2019est-elle pas en parfaite harmonie avec l\u2019objet de toute l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, soit de pr\u00e9venir la victimisation des individus en raison de caract\u00e9ristiques non pertinentes sur lesquelles ils n\u2019ont aucun contr\u00f4le [\u2026], ou \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquelles leur libert\u00e9 de choix est d\u2019une importance tellement vitale qu\u2019elle ne doit en aucun cas \u00eatre frein\u00e9e par la peur d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles cons\u00e9quences discriminatoires [\u2026].\n[233] Le Tribunal conclut que la libert\u00e9 de choisir de devenir p\u00e8re ou m\u00e8re est si vitale qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre restreinte par la crainte de subir des cons\u00e9quences discriminatoires. En tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le Canada devrait reconna\u00eetre cette libert\u00e9 fondamentale et appuyer ce choix autant que possible. Pour l\u2019employeur, cela signifie \u00e9valuer les situations telles que celles de Mme Johnstone de fa\u00e7on individuelle et travailler avec elle pour cr\u00e9er une solution fonctionnelle qui \u00e9quilibre ses obligations parentales avec ses occasions d\u2019emploi, sauf contrainte excessive.\n[234] Ayant conclu que le motif de situation de famille comprend les responsabilit\u00e9s envers les enfants du type et de la dur\u00e9e mentionn\u00e9s par Mme Johnstone, le Tribunal doit maintenant examiner les deux questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au paragraphe 199 ci\u2011dessus, pour d\u00e9terminer si Mme Johnstone a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif en l\u2019absence d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse de l\u2019ASFC, s\u2019appuyant sur les d\u00e9cisions Martin et O\u2019Malley.\n[235] Une fois de plus, les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur le crit\u00e8re auquel Mme Johnstone doit satisfaire pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Mme Johnstone adopte le crit\u00e8re peu exigeant \u00e9tabli dans la d\u00e9cision Morris. Les enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario permettraient aussi \u00e0 Mme Johnstone de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a subi un d\u00e9savantage arbitraire fond\u00e9 sur sa situation de famille. Le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019ASFC a adopt\u00e9 une politique non \u00e9crite et une pratique visant \u00e0 arbitrairement forcer toute personne qui demandait des accommodements pour des raisons d\u2019obligations familiales, telles que prendre soin de jeunes enfants, \u00e0 ne travailler que 34 heures par semaine ou moins en \u00e9change d\u2019un honoraire diff\u00e9rent de l\u2019horaire habituel \u00e9tabli par l\u2019EPHV. Bien que l\u2019ASFC e\u00fbt fait des \u00e9valuations individuelles et des changements pour les personnes qui demandaient des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour des motifs m\u00e9dicaux et religieux, et qu\u2019assez souvent, elle ne respect\u00e2t pas sa propre politique arbitraire, l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 inflexible dans le cas de Mme Johnstone.\n[236] L\u2019ASFC adopte le raisonnement de la d\u00e9cision Campbel River selon lequel il existe un crit\u00e8re diff\u00e9rent et plus exigeant pour les cas de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Dans la d\u00e9cision Campbell River, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie\u2011Britannique avait conclu que les d\u00e9cisions du TCDP dans Brown et Wolden \u00e9taient [Traduction] trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique ne suit pas les directives de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans les arr\u00eats O\u2019Malley et Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. Le gouvernement de la province de la Colombie-Britannique repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par la Public Service Employee Relations Commission, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin).\n[237] La d\u00e9cision Campbell River adopte plut\u00f4t un nouveau crit\u00e8re plus important pour lequel il faut d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019employeur a fait preuve de mauvaise fois et s\u2019il y a eu un changement dans une condition d\u2019emploi qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une atteinte grave \u00e0 un devoir ou \u00e0 une obligation parentale importante de l\u2019employ\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision Hoyt a rejet\u00e9 cette analyse restrictive et le Tribunal en fait autant.\n[238] Le Tribunal est d\u2019accord avec Mme Johnstone au sujet du fait qu\u2019une personne ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 tol\u00e9rer un certain niveau de discrimination avant de se voir accorder la protection de la LCDP. Le juge Barnes \u00e9tait du m\u00eame avis dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone. Soit il y a discrimination, ou il n\u2019y en a pas, dans tout processus de plainte. S\u2019il y a discrimination, il ne peut pas y avoir hi\u00e9rarchie des motifs. La LCDP ne va pas en ce sens.\n[239] Dans la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente Rajotte c. Le pr\u00e9sident de l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada et al., 2009 TDFP 0025, dat\u00e9e du 7 ao\u00fbt 2009 (Rajotte), le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique a examin\u00e9 une plainte d\u2019une employ\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e contre la m\u00eame intim\u00e9e que la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La plaignante \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re qui soutenait qu\u2019on n\u2019avait pas examin\u00e9 sa candidature pour un certain poste ou des postes en raison d\u2019un abus de pouvoir par l\u2019ASFC et en raison de sa situation de famille.\n[240] Dans la d\u00e9cision Rajotte, le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique a suivi le raisonnement et la d\u00e9cision dans Brown, Wolden, Hoyt et Johnstone au sujet de la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille ainsi qu\u2019au sujet du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie, dans les arr\u00eats O\u2019Malley et Meiorin. La d\u00e9cision Rajotte rejette express\u00e9ment l\u2019approche dans la d\u00e9cision Campbell River.\n[241] L\u2019ASFC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 pouvoir traiter de l\u2019affaire Rajotte devant le Tribunal, parce que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue seulement deux semaines apr\u00e8s que les observations eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9es pour la pr\u00e9sente audience. Cependant, le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que toute observation suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire. La d\u00e9cision Rajotte est explicite et le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019elle est pertinente quant \u00e0 la plainte en esp\u00e8ce, mais pas contraignante.\n[242] Le Tribunal conclut que Mme Johnstone a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination exerc\u00e9e en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, parce que l\u2019ASFC a appliqu\u00e9 des pratiques discriminatoires et arbitraires en cours d\u2019emploi qui ont constitu\u00e9 une distinction illicite envers Mme Johnstone fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille. L\u2019ASFC a us\u00e9 de pratiques discriminatoires en fixant et en appliquant une politique non \u00e9crite communiqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la gestion et appliqu\u00e9e par la gestion qui affectait les occasions d\u2019emploi de Mme Johnstone, notamment la promotion, la formation, la mutation et les avantages sociaux, pratiques fond\u00e9es sur le motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille.\n[243] La politique et les pratiques fix\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es par l\u2019ASFC sont fond\u00e9es sur le point de vue que la situation de famille au sens de la LCDP ne comprend pas les obligations familiales de la nature de celles de Mme Johnstone. L\u2019ASFC a forc\u00e9 Mme Johnstone \u00e0 accepter un statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel, affectant ainsi n\u00e9gativement son emploi.\n[244] L\u2019ASFC prend des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour les personnes qui demandent un accommodement pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et religieuses en leur cr\u00e9ant des horaires qui ne respectent pas l\u2019EPHV, parfois de fa\u00e7on permanente. De plus, l\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas suivi uniform\u00e9ment cette politique non \u00e9crite arbitraire et discriminatoire, entra\u00eenant ainsi le fait que certains employ\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame situation que Mme Johnstone ont eu comme mesures d\u2019adaptation des horaires \u00e0 temps plein et des quarts de travail fixes ou des avantages sociaux \u00e0 temps plein m\u00eame s\u2019ils travaillaient \u00e0 temps partiel et des quarts de travail fixes.\n[245] Il convient de noter que l\u2019ASFC et ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs ont la directive du TCDP et de la CCDP depuis 1993 d\u2019\u00e9laborer des politiques d\u2019accommodement pour les employ\u00e9s qui demandent des mesures d\u2019accommodement en raison de leur situation de famille et qu\u2019elle sait que ces deux entit\u00e9s ont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 la situation de famille comme signifiant les responsabilit\u00e9s familiales du type et de la nature de celles de Mme Johnstone. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Johnstone \u00e9tait sans \u00e9quivoque : on ne lui a pas pos\u00e9 de question sur sa situation personnelle ni sur les difficult\u00e9s auxquelles elle faisait face, mais on a appliqu\u00e9 envers elle la politique non \u00e9crite arbitraire susmentionn\u00e9e selon laquelle elle devait soit se plier aux exigences de l\u2019EPHV, soit r\u00e9duire son horaire \u00e0 34 heures par semaine si elle souhaitait obtenir des quarts de travail fixes. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas tent\u00e9 de prendre des mesures particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 la situation de Mme Johnstone parce qu\u2019elle ne traite pas de telles demandes comme relevant de la port\u00e9e des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne.\n[246] Le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Star s\u2019il y a quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC qui travaille maintenant, ou qui a travaill\u00e9 au cours des deux derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, dans le poste de conseiller en \u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi ou de coordonnateur des dossiers de d\u00e9ficience et d\u2019accommodement, comme le recommandait l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement, et la r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gative.\n[247] M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que deux superviseurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s pour coordonner (et surveiller) pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les questions d\u2019accommodement pour raisons m\u00e9dicales. Ils n\u2019ont pas de pouvoir de d\u00e9cision. Il existe un comit\u00e9 compos\u00e9 de M. Norm Sheridan, Mme Rhonda Raby, M. Darren Millet et possiblement d\u2019autres, qui examinent les demandes d\u2019accommodement m\u00e9dical, cas par cas.\n[248] Lorsque le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 qui traitait les demandes d\u2019accommodement pour des raisons autres que m\u00e9dicales, M. Star a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les m\u00eames deux superviseurs recueillent les renseignements et transf\u00e8rent les demandes au m\u00eame comit\u00e9 pour qu\u2019il prenne une d\u00e9cision.\n[249] Le Tribunal a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Star si un fonds national des am\u00e9nagements sp\u00e9ciaux existait \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC comme le recommandait l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement, et la r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gative.\nVI. Le dossier de l\u2019intim\u00e9e A. Le t\u00e9moignage de Norm Sheridan [250] M. Sheridan est le directeur du district des Op\u00e9rations des passagers pour l\u2019ASFC au TAP, l\u2019un des districts des Op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. Il a aussi occup\u00e9 ce poste sup\u00e9rieur pour les pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 partir du 1er avril 1999.\n[251] La position de l\u2019ASFC, telle que pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Sheridan et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, est que les employ\u00e9s qui demandent des mesures d\u2019adaptation pour des obligations parentales le font en raison de choix qu\u2019ils ont faits dans leur vie, pour lesquels l\u2019employeur n\u2019a aucune responsabilit\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire quelques ajustements \u00e0 l\u2019horaire d\u2019un tel employ\u00e9, elle qualifie ces ajustements d\u2019 ententes plut\u00f4t que d\u2019 accommodements.\n[252] Auparavant, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 58, M. Sheridan occupait un poste \u00e0 la haute direction de l\u2019ASFC, tenant les portefeuilles des Op\u00e9rations et des Ressources humaines du TAP et du Bureau r\u00e9gional du Grand Toronto. En tout, M. Sheridan a travaill\u00e9 pour l\u2019ASFC ou ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs depuis 1979, o\u00f9 il a commenc\u00e9 son emploi \u00e0 titre d\u2019inspecteur des douanes.\n[253] En raison de sa longue exp\u00e9rience comme employ\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s de cadre sup\u00e9rieur, M. Sheridan a beaucoup de connaissances au sujet de la structure de l\u2019ASFC quant aux fonctions du TAP et quant aux questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il se souvient tr\u00e8s bien des dates de transition d\u2019un pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de l\u2019ASFC \u00e0 un autre. Il a confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[254] \u00c0 la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019ASFC, la partie des douanes a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019Agence canadienne des douanes et du revenu (ADRC), la partie du Bureau int\u00e9rieur de l\u2019Immigration a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e des responsabilit\u00e9s de Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration et la partie de l\u2019inspection des aliments, des plantes et des animaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e des responsabilit\u00e9s de l\u2019Agence canadienne de l\u2019inspection des aliments. Le 8 octobre 2004, la responsabilit\u00e9 quant aux points d\u2019entr\u00e9e de Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC, pour cr\u00e9er l\u2019agence compl\u00e8te qu\u2019on conna\u00eet aujourd\u2019hui.\n[255] M. Sheridan a d\u00e9crit le mandat de l\u2019ASFC en date de janvier 2004 au TAP comme \u00e9tant la facilitation du d\u00e9placement des personnes et des biens \u00e0 faible risque au Canada, tout en d\u00e9tectant et en interdisant les personnes et les biens pr\u00e9sentant un fort risque, y compris les produits de l\u2019agriculture tels que les plantes, ainsi que les animaux. Ce mandat vise \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la s\u00fbret\u00e9 des Canadiens.\n[256] Au TAP, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, la responsabilit\u00e9 des points d\u2019entr\u00e9e de l\u2019immigration n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e, cependant, le mandat des douanes donnait de longue date \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC au TAP le pouvoir d\u2019effectuer des [Traduction] fonctions pr\u00e9liminaires en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration ou le [Traduction] contr\u00f4le s\u00e9curitaire pr\u00e9liminaire.\n[257] En 2004, il y avait trois terminaux fonctionnels, y compris l\u2019East Hold mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Les responsabilit\u00e9s des ASF aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers comprenaient, et comprennent toujours :\nLa ligne d\u2019inspection primaire : lorsque le public voit les inspecteurs dans des cabines ; L\u2019immigration : o\u00f9 des voyageurs sont r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9s par la ligne d\u2019inspection primaire, tels que les immigrants se pr\u00e9sentant pour la premi\u00e8re fois au Canada, les demandeurs d\u2019asile, les personnes qui ont des visas et les personnes qui devraient \u00eatre interdites de territoire en raison de leur criminalit\u00e9 ; L\u2019inspection secondaire des douanes : o\u00f9 les voyageurs paient les droits de douanes et les taxes et o\u00f9 les bagages sont inspect\u00e9s.\n[258] Les ASF \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019inspection primaire d\u00e9terminent s\u2019il faut renvoyer un voyageur \u00e0 l\u2019inspection secondaire, o\u00f9 l\u2019ASF examinera les documents du voyageur, la raison du renvoi et d\u00e9terminera quelles autres mesures doivent \u00eatre prises, y compris la d\u00e9tention ou la saisie. Le renvoi est principalement fait par voie de syst\u00e8me de code \u00e9crit sur la d\u00e9claration douani\u00e8re du voyageur.\n[259] Quelques ASF n\u2019ont pas encore re\u00e7u la formation au sujet des droits de douanes actuels pour la nourriture, l\u2019immigration et les douanes. Depuis juillet 2005, la formation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re des ASF \u00e0 Rigaud (Qu\u00e9bec) comprend maintenant la formation au sujet de tous les droits, y compris une familiarisation avec les lois pertinentes. Cela comprend une formation sur les tactiques de ma\u00eetrise et de d\u00e9fense et une formation sur tous les processus qu\u2019un ASF doit suivre dans son travail habituel. La formation des ASF dure environ 14 semaines. D\u2019autres formations sont aussi disponibles et certaines formations sont donn\u00e9es plus tard dans certains lieux pr\u00e9cis.\n[260] Les ASF sont responsables du contr\u00f4le des armes \u00e0 feu, des drogues contr\u00f4l\u00e9es, de biens d\u2019agriculture, y compris les plantes, les animaux, les graines et les produits laitiers. L\u2019inspection des biens peut aussi comprendre l\u2019inspection d\u2019explosifs, de produits de t\u00e9l\u00e9communications, de m\u00e9taux pr\u00e9cieux, de m\u00e9dicaments, d\u2019armes, de pornographie infantile et de biens contr\u00f4l\u00e9s tels que les biens culturels, les objets historiques, les pierres pr\u00e9cieuses telles que les diamants, etc.\n[261] \u00c0 Gateway, M. Sheridan a d\u00e9crit le travail d\u2019un ASF comme \u00e9tant l\u2019examen du courrier qui entre au Canada, y compris les colis et les documents trait\u00e9s tant \u00e0 la ligne d\u2019inspection primaire qu\u2019\u00e0 la ligne d\u2019inspection secondaire. Le travail d\u2019un ASF aux Op\u00e9rations commerciales comprend une interaction limit\u00e9e avec le public et est ax\u00e9 principalement sur les biens import\u00e9s au Canada pour des raisons commerciales.\n[262] M. Sheridan a confirm\u00e9 que les t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es par les ASF en 2004 et pr\u00e9sentement aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers, aux Op\u00e9rations commerciales et \u00e0 Gateway sont \u00e9tablies dans une description de t\u00e2ches universelle et une classification.\n[263] M. Sheridan a d\u00e9crit son r\u00f4le de directeur comme \u00e9tant un r\u00f4le visant \u00e0 assurer le fonctionnement efficace et efficient du TAP pour le contr\u00f4le des voyageurs et de leurs biens. Cela se fait par le biais de 10 chefs des Op\u00e9rations subordonn\u00e9s. Chacun de ces chefs des op\u00e9rations, sauf pour un chef qui travaille \u00e0 un projet en particulier, a des surintendants qui rel\u00e8vent de lui. Les surintendants ont chacun une \u00e9quipe d\u2019ASF dont ils sont responsables et ce sont les ASF en premi\u00e8re ligne qui [Traduction] font le travail.\n[264] M. Sheridan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il re\u00e7oit un budget chaque ann\u00e9e de son patron, le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral r\u00e9gional pour la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto. On s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il examine constamment son programme et qu\u2019il cible des fa\u00e7ons de l\u2019am\u00e9liorer en respectant les param\u00e8tres et les directives \u00e9tablis par r\u00e9gion dans le cadre des lois applicables.\n[265] M. Sheridan a donn\u00e9 beaucoup de d\u00e9tails sur les op\u00e9rations du TAP et sur sa structure, a produit des organigrammes et divers exemples d\u2019horaires de travail pour d\u00e9montrer les subtilit\u00e9s de l\u2019EPHV, parce qu\u2019un ASF travaille pendant une p\u00e9riode donn\u00e9e par quarts de travail rotatifs changeants.\n[266] Bien qu\u2019un t\u00e9moignage extensif e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au sujet des Op\u00e9rations du TAP, le t\u00e9moignage le plus pertinent de M. Sheridan en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce portait sur la justification de l\u2019ASFC au sujet des demandes d\u2019adaptation, le point de vue de l\u2019ASFC au sujet de telles demandes fond\u00e9es sur des responsabilit\u00e9s familiales, la m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e pour traiter les demandes d\u2019adaptation pour raisons m\u00e9dicales et religieuses, ainsi que la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019ASFC et ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs ont trait\u00e9 les diverses d\u00e9cisions mentionn\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus \u00e0 la partie IV au sujet du traitement des demandes fond\u00e9es sur la situation de famille au sein de l\u2019ASFC et en particulier au TAP.\n[267] Il ne fait aucun doute que le TAP est une op\u00e9ration internationale tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9e qui a un mandat important et qui, par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine pour remplir son mandat. Cependant, le Tribunal a ultimement conclu que le niveau de d\u00e9tail des op\u00e9rations n\u2019aide pas vraiment \u00e0 traiter les questions fondamentales dont il est saisi.\n[268] L\u2019ASFC ne per\u00e7oit pas les employ\u00e9s qui ont besoin d\u2019accommodement pour leurs responsabilit\u00e9s familiales comme \u00e9tant un groupe qui rel\u00e8ve de la protection de la LCDP. L\u2019ASFC est d\u2019avis que de tels employ\u00e9s qui ne peuvent pas respecter l\u2019horaire de quart de travail de l\u2019EPHV ont le choix de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel, de prendre un cong\u00e9 sans solde pour les soins et l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019un enfant de trois semaines jusqu\u2019\u00e0 cinq ans ou de d\u00e9missionner. M. Sheridan a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 cette position en disant [Traduction] les employ\u00e9s prennent leurs propres d\u00e9cisions.\n[269] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que toutes les demandes d\u2019accommodement non m\u00e9dicales portent le nom distinct d\u2019 ententes, y compris les demandes fond\u00e9es sur des raisons familiales, des choix de vie, des besoins en raison d\u2019\u00e9tudes et des pratiques religieuses. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019auparavant, toutes ces demandes \u00e9taient qualifi\u00e9es par la gestion d\u2019 accommodements, mais qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision avait bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 prise afin de [Traduction] reprendre le contr\u00f4le de la situation r\u00e9elle en utilisant des termes diff\u00e9rents pour d\u00e9crire les choses diff\u00e9rentes.\n[270] Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire s\u2019il y avait beaucoup de demandes d\u2019employ\u00e9es en retour de cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ou d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 des enfants pour des mesures d\u2019accommodement les exemptant de l\u2019EPHV, M. Sheridan a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative.\n[271] M. Sheridan a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019en vertu de la convention collective, il existe un certain nombre de cong\u00e9s sans solde diff\u00e9rents pour les parents ainsi que d\u2019autres aides telles que le Programme d\u2019aide aux employ\u00e9s qui fournissent des services gratuits pour diff\u00e9rents probl\u00e8mes, comme les recommandations pour des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, les recommandations pour les soins aux a\u00een\u00e9s ou aux enfants et les s\u00e9ances de counselling pour les d\u00e9pendances et les maladies mentales.\n[272] M. Sheridan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant des strat\u00e9gies et des objectifs de l\u2019ADRC ou de l\u2019ASFC visant \u00e0 appuyer l\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait rien re\u00e7u \u00e0 ce sujet de la part de la haute direction. M\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait directeur des Ressources humaines dans la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto pour l\u2019ASFC en 1993 lorsque la d\u00e9cision Brown a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, il n\u2019a aucune connaissance de politiques d\u00e9coulant de cette d\u00e9cision qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es par l\u2019ASFC ou ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs.\n[273] En ce qui a trait aux raisons op\u00e9rationnelles de l\u2019existence de l\u2019EPHV, M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la rotation de tous les ASF dans un horaire de quarts de travail r\u00e9partis sur 24 heures permet aux employ\u00e9s de partager \u00e9quitablement les quarts de travail populaires et moins populaires. Cela expose aussi les ASF \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents types de voyageurs et \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents niveaux d\u2019achalandage.\n[274] Les quarts de travail de minuit sont les moins populaires, cependant, certains employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent travailler seulement pendant le quart de travail de minuit. Par cons\u00e9quent, dans la derni\u00e8re version de l\u2019EPHV au TAP, des quarts de travail fixes de minuit ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s.\n[275] M. Sheridan a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la nouvelle EPHV permet \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s de travailler pendant des jours fixes de la semaine, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire du jeudi jusqu\u2019au dimanche ou du vendredi jusqu\u2019au lundi. Cela est offert principalement aux nouveaux employ\u00e9s connus sous le nom de recrues aux points d\u2019entr\u00e9e. Ces ASF sont affect\u00e9s aux \u00e9quipes \u00e0 horaires fixes. Bien entendu, c\u2019\u00e9tait ce que Mme Johnstone demandait \u2013 des jours fixes sans quarts de travail pr\u00e9cis demand\u00e9s lors de ces journ\u00e9es.\n[276] M. Sheridan a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu voix dans la d\u00e9cision de cr\u00e9er et de garder un registre des accommodements au TAP qu\u2019il a vu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 depuis environ 2000 ou 2001. Il se souvient que la gestion avait besoin de g\u00e9rer les demandes d\u2019accommodement. \u00c0 un certain moment, toute personne qui travaillait \u00e0 temps partiel voyait son nom inscrit au registre des accommodements, peu importe la raison pour laquelle l\u2019employ\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait retrouv\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Il y avait environ de 32 \u00e0 35 personnes inscrites au registre.\n[277] M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son patron, le directeur r\u00e9gional, avait voulu s\u00e9parer les accommodements pour raisons m\u00e9dicales des autres raisons g\u00e9n\u00e9riques afin d\u2019effectuer un meilleur suivi. Certains des employ\u00e9s avaient plus d\u2019une raison pour vouloir \u00eatre exempt\u00e9s de l\u2019EPHV, alors leur nom restait au registre des accommodements. Autrement, si un employ\u00e9 avait re\u00e7u des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, leur nom n\u2019\u00e9tait plus inscrit au registre. Les accommodements pour raisons m\u00e9dicales \u00e9taient per\u00e7ues et trait\u00e9es comme des questions de ressources humaines, mais les autres demandes \u00e9taient purement op\u00e9rationnelles.\n[278] M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, il \u00e9tait devenu n\u00e9cessaire du point de vue de la gestion de mieux g\u00e9rer les employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient \u00e0 temps partiel afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la coh\u00e9rence. Par exemple, on \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y avait certains employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient pendant 36 heures par semaine afin d\u2019obtenir une souplesse et possiblement des quarts de travail fixes qui peuvent \u00eatre offerts gr\u00e2ce au statut d\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel et qui ne suivent pas l\u2019horaire de l\u2019EPHV. Pour cette raison, une politique non \u00e9crite a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e selon laquelle quiconque travaille \u00e0 temps partiel ne peut travailler que 34 heures par semaine. La gestion \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que cela d\u00e9couragerait les employ\u00e9s de demander \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel, tout en gardant des heures presque \u00e0 temps plein, simplement pour \u00e9viter l\u2019EPHV.\n[279] En raison de la d\u00e9cision de traiter les demandes de mesures d\u2019accommodement pour des obligations parentales comme refl\u00e9tant seulement un choix personnel (de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019une personne qui retourne \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole ou qui d\u00e9cide de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel pour des raisons de vie personnelle), les employ\u00e9s qui faisaient de telles demandes relevaient alors de la politique des 34 heures maximales par semaine en temps partiel.\n[280] Une autre politique non \u00e9crite de l\u2019ASFC veut que les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel ne travaillent pas plus de 10 heures par jour. M. Sheridan a exprim\u00e9 la pr\u00e9occupation que le rendement des employ\u00e9s risque de souffrir en terme d\u2019\u00e9nergie et de concentration si on permet aux employ\u00e9s de travailler de plus longues heures. C\u2019est pourquoi on a dit \u00e0 Mme Johnstone qu\u2019elle ne pourrait pas travailler pendant un quart de travail de 13 heures, trois jours par semaine, mais seulement 10 heures pour ces trois jours par semaine, en plus de quatre heures lors d\u2019une quatri\u00e8me journ\u00e9e.\n[281] Cependant, M. Sheridan a reconnu que certains employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel travaillent plus de 10 heures par jour et que cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 afin de respecter [Traduction] les besoins op\u00e9rationnels. De plus, M. Sheridan a reconnu que tant aujourd\u2019hui qu\u2019en 2004, de nombreux ASF \u00e0 temps partiel ont des quarts de travail de plus de 10 heures et que certains d\u2019entre eux travaillent plus de 34 heures par semaine.\n[282] Gateway et les sites de fronti\u00e8res terrestres, par exemple, ont de nombreux employ\u00e9s qui travaillent plus de 10 heures par jour. Certainement, aux sites de fronti\u00e8res terrestres, M. Sheridan a reconnu que les ASF doivent faire preuve de vigilance constante et doivent \u00eatre pr\u00eats \u00e0 r\u00e9agir \u00e0 des situations impr\u00e9vues.\n[283] L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve pour justifier son point de vue fond\u00e9 sur des impressions selon lesquelles un quart de travail de plus de 10 heures pour un ASF aurait des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur les op\u00e9rations et le rendement.\n[284] M. Sheridan est d\u2019accord avec les autres t\u00e9moins au sujet du fait que la p\u00e9riode la plus achaland\u00e9e au TAP est la p\u00e9riode de l\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi d\u2019environ 14 h \u00e0 22 h. Il se trouve que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps partiel qui ont la possibilit\u00e9 de choisir un quart de travail fixe qui leur convient le mieux choisissent cette p\u00e9riode. M. Sheridan a reconnu que cette harmonisation rendrait l\u2019accommodement \u00e0 temps plein plus facile et Mme Johnstone \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 travailler pendant cette p\u00e9riode pour les trois jours qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9s. Cependant, la politique arbitraire \u00e9tait en place et aucune \u00e9valuation personnelle de la demande de Mme Johnstone n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e.\n[285] Compte tenu de la distinction des demandes d\u2019accommodement m\u00e9dicales des autres ententes, et compte tenu du fait que l\u2019ASFC a reconnu qu\u2019elle devait prendre de telles mesures d\u2019accommodement en vertu des lois en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne, un syst\u00e8me a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9 pour traiter les demandes pour raisons m\u00e9dicales de fa\u00e7on individuelle. Deux gestionnaires ont la t\u00e2che de coordonner et de superviser de telles demandes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire recueillir les documents m\u00e9dicaux et les autres renseignements factuels du contexte afin de mettre en \u00e9tat la demande.\n[286] La demande est alors envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 un comit\u00e9 r\u00e9gional qui porte le nom de [Traduction] sous-comit\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019accommodement. Ce comit\u00e9, auquel M. Sheridan participe, est compos\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants de la gestion de l\u2019ASFC. Les r\u00e9unions sont r\u00e9guli\u00e8res et le comit\u00e9 re\u00e7oit une liste des demandes \u00e0 examiner ainsi que les renseignements contextuels pertinents. \u00c0 ce niveau, une d\u00e9cision est prise quant \u00e0 l\u2019accueil de la demande, le besoin de renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires ou de clarifications ou le rejet de la demande accompagn\u00e9 de motifs. Pour aider \u00e0 prendre ces d\u00e9cisions, les membres du comit\u00e9 suivent une politique de l\u2019ASFC intitul\u00e9e [Traduction] Directives provisoires pour les accommodements m\u00e9dicaux.\n[287] Les comptes rendus de ces r\u00e9unions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s avant le milieu de l\u2019audience, apr\u00e8s que M. Sheridan eut t\u00e9moign\u00e9 quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence et aux pratiques du comit\u00e9. Ces comptes rendus ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que le comit\u00e9 re\u00e7oit aussi des demandes d\u2019accommodement pour des raisons autres que des raisons m\u00e9dicales qui, selon M. Sheridan, n\u2019auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au comit\u00e9. Les comptes rendus ont aussi r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que parfois, les demandes d\u2019accommodement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9es aux employ\u00e9s qui ont des enfants avec des besoins m\u00e9dicaux.\n[288] En d\u2019autres mots, l\u2019ASFC au TAP a trouv\u00e9 une fa\u00e7on efficace et individuelle de traiter les demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons m\u00e9dicales. Elle a aussi pris des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour un employ\u00e9 qui a un enfant avec des besoins m\u00e9dicaux, mais elle ne reconna\u00eet pas et n\u2019\u00e9value pas de fa\u00e7on individuelle la demande de mesures d\u2019accommodement d\u2019un employ\u00e9 pour prendre soin d\u2019un enfant en sant\u00e9.\n[289] On a demand\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire \u00e0 M. Sheridan si son budget op\u00e9rationnel restreignait la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019ASFC de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d\u2019accommodement et si l\u2019ASFC avait des contraintes budg\u00e9taires qui l\u2019emp\u00eachaient d\u2019accommoder Mme Johnstone en particulier. La r\u00e9ponse de Mme Sheridan a \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] non.\n[290] Dans une question de suivi, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sheridan si l\u2019ASFC ou lui avait pris des mesures pour \u00e9valuer les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s au fait de ne pas traiter les questions d\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle. Sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] non.\n[291] M. Sheridan a confirm\u00e9 que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor est l\u2019employeur l\u00e9gal des ASF et que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor devait lui donner des directives sur les questions d\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle.\n[292] On a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sheridan un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui visait les op\u00e9rations 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine \u00e9crit par Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada qui portait le titre Foire aux questions pour les organisations (Conciliation travail-vie ) (FAQ Conciliation travail-vie). On lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il avait fait pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ces directives.\n[293] M. Sheridan a r\u00e9pondu que [Traduction] nous avons n\u00e9goci\u00e9 une EPHV plus flexible pour permettre aux employ\u00e9s d\u2019obtenir une pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9. Cette nouvelle EPHV donne aux employ\u00e9s r\u00e9guliers plus de temps de cong\u00e9 la fin de semaine. M. Sheridan \u00e9tait aussi d\u2019avis que l\u2019horaire de 34 heures ou moins impos\u00e9 aux personnes qui demandaient des accommodements en raison de leur situation de famille, en soi, correspondait aux efforts d\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle.\n[294] Parmi les renseignements qui se trouvaient dans la FAQ Conciliation travail-vie se trouvaient les points suivants\nComment est-il possible de concilier travail et vie dans un environnement de travail qui fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine? Il n'existe aucun environnement de travail, emploi ou poste qui ne puisse permettre \u00e0 un individu de concilier son travail et sa vie. La question plus pertinente serait plut\u00f4t Comment est-il possible de cr\u00e9er un environnement de travail qui reconnaisse la conciliation travail-vie et le bien-\u00eatre de chacun comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments critiques de la vie individuelle et organisationnelle afin d'avoir du succ\u00e8s \u00e0 court et \u00e0 long terme et ce, peu importe le genre d'environnement, que ce soit un environnement de travail en fonction 24 heures par jour et 7 jours par semaine, un environnement par quarts [\u2026]Les organisations doivent examiner [\u2026]la charge, la structure et les syst\u00e8mes de travail, la conciliation travail-vie, le bien-\u00eatre, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la sant\u00e9.\nComment s\u2019assurer que tous les employ\u00e9s ne se pr\u00e9valent pas d\u2019horaires flexibles si l\u2019organisation commence \u00e0 appuyer la conciliation travail-vie? [\u2026] On sait cependant que la plupart des gens pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent un environnement de travail plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9visible, routinier et stable et ce, peu importe si cette personne travaille sur des quarts de jour ou de nuit ou de 9 h 00 \u00e0 17 h 00 du lundi au vendredi. Les employ\u00e9s d\u00e9sirent la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 et la consistance. Le mythe de la flexibilit\u00e9 est que les gens vont et viennent \u00e0 leur guise. Ils sont pay\u00e9s pour des journ\u00e9es non travaill\u00e9es et ce sont les autres employ\u00e9s qui font leur travail. En fait, les conditions d'un am\u00e9nagement de travail flexible exige des communications, des n\u00e9gociations et de la documentation claires et consistantes.\nQu\u2019est-ce que les organisations peuvent faire pour les employ\u00e9s qui disent Ce n\u2019est pas juste. Je n\u2019ai pas d\u2019enfants. Cela profite seulement \u00e0 certaines personnes. ? [\u2026] Il est aussi possible de pr\u00e9venir les r\u00e9actions n\u00e9gatives en s'assurant que des processus permettant aux personnes de se pr\u00e9valoir des modalit\u00e9s de travail flexible soient en place. Afin d'\u00e9viter que les dirigeants privil\u00e9gient certaines personnes, il est crucial d'avoir en place un processus clair et bien document\u00e9 qui puisse \u00eatre mis en pratique de fa\u00e7on consistante et juste.\nComment les changements d\u00e9mographiques canadiens affecteront-ils la fa\u00e7on dont les organisations g\u00e8rent la conciliation travail-vie? Premi\u00e8rement, la main-d'\u0153uvre vieillissante forcera les organisations \u00e0 \u00eatre plus cr\u00e9atives pour composer avec les retraites \u00e9ventuelles. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration Nexus entre sur le march\u00e9 du travail bien consciente de ce qu'elle veut d'un employeur : un travail int\u00e9ressant pour un salaire int\u00e9ressant sans avoir \u00e0 sacrifier sa vie personnelle pour son travail. Troisi\u00e8mement, il y a une s\u00e9rieuse p\u00e9nurie de main-d'\u0153uvre [\u2026] les employeurs qui d\u00e9sirent attirer et conserver de bons employ\u00e9s devront se plier aux exigences de ces derniers.\n[295] Le Tribunal a conclu que le contenu de la FAQ Conciliation travail-vie, dat\u00e9e du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2005, correspondait en particulier au t\u00e9moignage et au rapport de Mme Linda Duxbury.\n[296] Bien que M. Sheridan e\u00fbt occup\u00e9 le m\u00eame poste en 2003, sous le pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur de l\u2019ASF, qu\u2019il occupe maintenant, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas du tout au courant des directives du 10 d\u00e9cembre 2003 d\u00e9coulant de la v\u00e9rification de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi ni de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement dat\u00e9e de juin 2007.\n[297] On a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sheridan comment il \u00e9tait possible qu\u2019il ne soit pas au courant de ces documents. M. Sheridan a not\u00e9 que la v\u00e9rification de conformit\u00e9 est dat\u00e9e de deux jours avant la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019ASFC et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que certaines politiques aient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es de l\u2019ADRC \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de politiques portant sur une v\u00e9rification de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es. Aucun t\u00e9moin de l\u2019ASFC n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 expliquer qui \u00e9tait responsable de la r\u00e9ception de cette v\u00e9rification de la conformit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi ou de quelle fa\u00e7on cette v\u00e9rification avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e dans le cadre de la transition de l\u2019ADRC \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC.\n[298] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement, M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne l\u2019a pas consult\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet et que normalement, les responsables de l\u2019\u00e9bauche devaient consulter les gestionnaires. Comme il y a 190 directeurs \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC, une telle \u00e9bauche n\u2019aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qu\u2019\u00e0 certains d\u2019entre eux. Le Tribunal note que M. Darren Millet, selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Star, avait eu connaissance de l\u2019\u00e9bauche, mais pas M. Sheridan, qui est son sup\u00e9rieur. De plus, M. John King, alors pr\u00e9sident du syndicat, a pris une copie de l\u2019\u00e9bauche lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union \u00e0 laquelle il a particip\u00e9 et pourtant, M. Sheridan n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9 et n\u2019avait pas vu l\u2019\u00e9bauche avant l\u2019audience.\n[299] Aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 par l\u2019ASFC pour expliquer ce qui est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique apr\u00e8s sa diffusion, la raison pour laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e en premier lieu, la raison pour laquelle le directeur des Op\u00e9rations pour le TAP n\u2019en aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 ni la raison pour laquelle elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e apr\u00e8s sa cr\u00e9ation. Il n\u2019y a aucune preuve d\u2019une d\u00e9cision prise contre l\u2019adoption de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique pour des raisons de contraintes excessives, par exemple.\n[300] Lorsqu\u2019on lui a pos\u00e9 des questions au sujet du rapport d\u2019expert de M. Moore\u2011Ede pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour l\u2019ASFC, M. Sheridan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il adoptait enti\u00e8rement ses conclusions.\n[301] M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si l\u2019on avait pris des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales de Mme Johnstone, il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que la gestion aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 submerg\u00e9e de telles demandes, que les co\u00fbts auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 prohibitifs et que cela aurait eu un effet destructeur sur les op\u00e9rations au TAP, qui n\u00e9cessitent que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s suivent l\u2019horaire de l\u2019EPHV.\n[302] Bien que M. Sheridan e\u00fbt t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que peu de demandes d\u2019accommodement avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en raison des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales, il a seulement fond\u00e9 sur des impressions son avis au sujet des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives d\u2019un tel accommodement. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a produit aucune \u00e9tude ou enqu\u00eate sur la question de la contrainte excessive en termes de co\u00fbt, de niveau du moral ou de probl\u00e8mes op\u00e9rationnels. Les raisons fond\u00e9es sur des impressions ne sont pas suffisantes pour prouver une EPJ.\n[303] La seule preuve produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour soutenir la position de l\u2019ASFC selon laquelle elle aurait subi une contrainte excessive est le rapport d\u2019expert et le t\u00e9moignage de M. Moore-Ede, qui n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit que pour l\u2019audience, quelques mois avant le d\u00e9but de celle\u2011ci. En fait, lorsqu\u2019on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sheridan pourquoi M. Moore\u2011Ede n\u2019avait pas fait de sondage aupr\u00e8s des employ\u00e9s actuels au TAP, il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il avait manqu\u00e9 de temps. L\u2019audience a eu lieu cinq ans apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[304] M. Sheridan a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le taux de roulement des employ\u00e9s au TAP est important et cause des pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 la gestion, cependant, il ne semble y avoir aucune reconnaissance du fait que de meilleures mesures d\u2019accommodement et une souplesse dans les quarts de travail pourraient r\u00e9gler une partie de ce probl\u00e8me.\nB. Le t\u00e9moignage de Rhonda Raby [305] Quand on lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne pourrait pas travailler \u00e0 temps plein, en d\u00e9cembre 2003, Mme Johnstone a \u00e9crit un courriel \u00e0 Mme Rhonda Raby, alors chef par int\u00e9rim du terminal 1 aux Op\u00e9rations des passagers du TAP, pour essayer d\u2019\u00e9tablir son nouvel horaire.\n[306] Le Tribunal accepte le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Johnstone selon lequel son mari a approch\u00e9 Mme Raby au nom de Mme Johnstone \u00e0 l\u2019automne de cette ann\u00e9e\u2011l\u00e0. Mme Raby lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle n\u2019approuverait pas des quarts de travail de plus de 10 heures pour Mme Johnstone.\n[307] Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Johnstone a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler les vendredis, les dimanches et les lundis de 11 h \u00e0 21 h 30 chaque jour. Mme Raby a accept\u00e9 cette proposition.\n[308] Mme Raby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que Mme Gerstl n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec elle au sujet de la premi\u00e8re demande de Mme Johnstone et elle a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle et Mme Johnstone n\u2019ont jamais discut\u00e9 directement \u00e0 ce sujet non plus. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Raby n\u2019\u00e9tait pas au courant de la demande initiale de Mme Johnstone \u00e0 Mme Gerstl, mais le Tribunal conclut que cela ne tire pas \u00e0 cons\u00e9quence. Mme Raby a suivi la politique non \u00e9crite de l\u2019ASFC lorsqu\u2019elle a trait\u00e9 avec Mme Johnstone et son approche n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.\n[309] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Raby semblait avoir peu de connaissance au sujet des exigences l\u00e9gales en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle occupe un poste de gestion.\n[310] Le Tribunal a aussi not\u00e9 que Mme Raby avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame si elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chef des Op\u00e9rations du terminal 1 de 2002 \u00e0 2008 et qu\u2019elle avait vu ses niveaux de personnel doubler et l\u2019achalandage doubler apr\u00e8s la fermeture du terminal 2 en 2006, elle ne se souvenait pas qu\u2019une autre personne ait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein au retour du cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que souvent, les femmes souhaitent travailler \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 leur retour du cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[311] De plus, pendant ces ann\u00e9es, le nombre moyen de mesures d\u2019accommodement par terminal (comprenant toutes les demandes pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales ou religieuses et pour les responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation ou de famille) pour les trois terminaux \u00e9tait de 15 personnes en tout temps, ou de 45 personnes pour toute l\u2019op\u00e9ration (une estimation de moyenne \u00e0 faible). Le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un niveau tout \u00e0 fait g\u00e9rable.\n[312] Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Raby a souvent fait allusion aux proc\u00e9dures normales d\u2019exploitation, non \u00e9crites, qui traitent du fait que l\u2019obligation de suivre un horaire \u00e0 temps partiel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place parce que autrement, la gestion aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] submerg\u00e9e de demandes. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pour \u00e9viter cela, la gestion avait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment fix\u00e9 le maximum d\u2019heures \u00e0 34 heures pour rendre le temps partiel moins d\u00e9sirable, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire qu\u2019on d\u00e9courage les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des demandes d\u2019accommodement.\n[313] Mme Raby ne semble pas avoir vu l\u2019ironie de ses remarques. La gestion a fix\u00e9 le maximum d\u2019heures \u00e0 temps partiel \u00e0 34 heures pour le rendre moins d\u00e9sirable, mais pourtant la gestion impose la maximum de 34 heures \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s comme Mme Johnstone qui veulent travailler \u00e0 temps plein, mais qui ont besoin de mesures d\u2019adaptation pour y arriver.\n[314] Mme Raby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la premi\u00e8re demande de Fiona Johnstone, il y avait un chef des Op\u00e9rations pour les terminaux 1, 2 et 3. Il y avait aussi un directeur responsable de Gateway (M. Sheridan). Les chefs se consultaient au sujet des demandes d\u2019accommodement (toutes les demandes, peu importe la raison), mais \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, ils ne consultaient pas le directeur de Gateway.\n[315] On a pos\u00e9 beaucoup de questions au cours de l\u2019audience \u00e0 savoir pourquoi Mme Johnstone ne pouvait pas obtenir des quarts de travail de 12,5 heures \u00e0 Gateway, o\u00f9 de tels quarts de travail existent, et l\u2019une des excuses de l\u2019ASFC, soit qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un environnement de travail tr\u00e8s stressant, est fausse. Mme Raby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que comme les directeurs ne communiquaient pas, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une option qui n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e ni sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Johnstone. Mme Raby a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun des districts distincts au sein du TAP ne communiquait avec les autres districts au sujet des demandes d\u2019accommodement.\n[316] Mme Raby a confirm\u00e9 que la gestion de l\u2019ASFC traite diff\u00e9remment les demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons m\u00e9dicales parce que l\u2019ASFC agit conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la preuve m\u00e9dicale, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0-dire la validation d\u2019un m\u00e9decin, que la mesure d\u2019accommodement est n\u00e9cessaire pour des raisons de sant\u00e9, de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de responsabilit\u00e9.\n[317] Mme Raby a confirm\u00e9 que ce ne sont pas tous les employ\u00e9s qui obtiennent des mesures d\u2019accommodement qui travaillent \u00e0 temps partiel, mais souvent dans le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019ASFC, il y a eu de la confusion entre les personnes qui ont droit \u00e0 des mesures d\u2019accommodement et le terme temps partiel.\n[318] M. Star est un exemple d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui re\u00e7oit des mesures d\u2019accommodement et qui ne travaille pas \u00e0 temps partiel. On a pris des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour lui de fa\u00e7on permanente et continue pour ses pratiques religieuses.\n[319] La majorit\u00e9 des personnes qui demandent des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour des raisons religieuses n\u2019en ont pas besoin de fa\u00e7on continue, pour chaque p\u00e9riode de quart de travail, par exemple les chr\u00e9tiens qui ne souhaitent pas travailler la veille de No\u00ebl ou le dimanche de P\u00e2ques, ou les musulmans qui pourraient vouloir faire un voyage de plusieurs jours \u00e0 la Mecque, ou qui ont besoin de courtes p\u00e9riodes de cong\u00e9 pour la pri\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces personnes re\u00e7oivent des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour une courte p\u00e9riode, de temps en temps, mais sont toujours des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 temps plein.\n[320] Bien entendu, les accommodements pour raisons m\u00e9dicales d\u00e9pendent de la raison de sant\u00e9 et peuvent n\u00e9cessiter un accommodement \u00e0 tr\u00e8s court terme ou \u00e0 long terme, selon ce que le m\u00e9decin estime que l\u2019employ\u00e9 peut faire. Cela peut affecter le nombre de jours que l\u2019employ\u00e9 peut travailler, ou les heures ou les t\u00e2ches qui peuvent lui \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es. Ces mesures d\u2019accommodement n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas toutes du temps partiel non plus.\n[321] Mme Raby a confirm\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de M. Sheridan selon lequel le terme accommodement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC pour signifier tous les ajustements qui ne respectent pas l\u2019EPHV. Cela pouvait porter \u00e0 confusion, alors la gestion avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rencier les cas en utilisant le terme accommodement pour les demandes \u00e0 caract\u00e8re m\u00e9dical, et ententes pour les autres demandes. De telles ententes comprennent celles o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 demande un changement \u00e0 l\u2019horaire pour retourner aux \u00e9tudes, etc.\n[322] Il est clair que Mme Raby n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u plus qu\u2019une formation sommaire en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en ce qui a trait \u00e0 sa compr\u00e9hension de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement pour raisons m\u00e9dicales. Elle savait cependant qu\u2019il y avait d\u2019autres motifs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la LCDP.\n[323] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Raby a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que les efforts de l\u2019ASFC, si efforts il y avait eu, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait inad\u00e9quats sur le plan de la formation, m\u00eame des gestionnaires, sur les questions de droits de la personne, des obligations, des devoirs ou des processus.\n[324] L\u2019approche de l\u2019ASFC lorsqu\u2019elle recevait une demande d\u2019accommodement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer une enqu\u00eate suffisante ou de poser des questions sur le contexte afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir la validit\u00e9 de la demande, sa l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9. Aucun effort n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 pour essayer de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande d\u2019accommodement ou pour d\u00e9terminer quels seraient la r\u00e9percussion r\u00e9elle ou les co\u00fbts associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la demande. Cela d\u00e9coule d\u2019une conviction r\u00e9pandue au niveau de la gestion que trop d\u2019employ\u00e9s demanderaient \u00e0 \u00eatre exempt\u00e9s de l\u2019EPHV, ce qui du point de vue op\u00e9rationnel serait trop difficile. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Raby, telle est la question r\u00e9elle, et non le co\u00fbt.\n[325] Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 si d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s s\u2019\u00e9taient plaints au sujet de coll\u00e8gues dont les quarts de travail avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9s en raison d\u2019accommodements m\u00e9dicaux, Mme Raby a r\u00e9pondu [Traduction] oui. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9ciser, elle s\u2019est souvenue avoir re\u00e7u un courriel et elle fonde sa croyance sur le fait qu\u2019il y a des [Traduction] probl\u00e8mes de moral au sujet des accommodements pour raisons m\u00e9dicales d\u2019apr\u00e8s [Traduction] ce [qu\u2019elle] entend au travail.\n[326] Bien qu\u2019elle f\u00fbt chef des Op\u00e9rations et qu\u2019elle ait eu le mandat pendant les ann\u00e9es en question de traiter et de trancher les demandes d\u2019accommodement, Mme Raby a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait gard\u00e9 aucun registre des employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 accommod\u00e9s et qu\u2019elle gardait les demandes de travail par quarts fixes \u00e0 temps plein seulement dans un dossier de courriel.\n[327] Mme Raby a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si un poste s\u2019ouvrait dans un domaine pour lequel un employ\u00e9 avait exprim\u00e9 le d\u00e9sir de travailler, elle ne faisait pas particuli\u00e8rement de recoupements. En d\u2019autres mots, bien qu\u2019elle eut rejet\u00e9 la demande de Mme Johnstone, si une occasion s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour elle de satisfaire la demande dans un domaine o\u00f9 Mme Johnstone aurait exprim\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat, Mme Raby n\u2019aurait pas tent\u00e9 d\u2019organiser cette occasion et d\u2019en parler \u00e0 Mme Johnstone.\n[328] Lorsque de nouvelles occasions d\u2019emploi se pr\u00e9sentent, une lettre d\u2019appel est envoy\u00e9e, que les employ\u00e9es en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ne re\u00e7oivent pas. Selon la personne qui pr\u00e9sente sa candidature, la gestion v\u00e9rifie la liste des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de rendement annuel de l\u2019employ\u00e9. Elle ne garde pas de registre et n\u2019examine pas les pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences inscrites, et elle ne garde pas ces donn\u00e9es. Il y a aussi des affichages par Internet et par intranet, mais les employ\u00e9s qui sont en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 ne re\u00e7oivent pas les affichages par Intranet et n\u2019en sont donc pas au courant.\n[329] Compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Raby au sujet de ces diverses questions, il est \u00e9vident pour le Tribunal que la gestion de l\u2019ASFC ne voit pas qu\u2019il a un r\u00f4le de coop\u00e9ration avec ses employ\u00e9s ASF, et pourtant, en ce qui a trait aux demandes d\u2019accommodement en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, c\u2019est exactement ce que la jurisprudence demande \u00e0 l\u2019employeur et aux employ\u00e9s de faire.\nC. Le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert de M. Moore\u2011Ede [330] M. Moore\u2011Ede a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 comme expert dans l\u2019\u00e9tude du travail par quarts et des heures de travail \u00e9tendues, y compris les analyses des niveaux de dotation, l\u2019optimisation des horaires de quarts de travail, la formation pour le style de vie d\u00e9coulant du travail par quarts et les analyses co\u00fbts-avantages au sujet des politiques de l\u2019employeur portant sur la gestion des employ\u00e9s par quarts de travail, y compris tous les facteurs pertinents quant \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration des horaires de travail par quart.\n[331] M. Moore\u2011Ede a fond\u00e9 Circadian en 1983, une firme internationale de recherche et de consultation qui se sp\u00e9cialise dans la fa\u00e7on de g\u00e9rer le d\u00e9fi d\u2019employer des travailleurs dans un environnement qui fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine.\n[332] Ses bases de donn\u00e9es indiquent qu\u2019environ 52 % de tous les travailleurs par quarts ont des besoins en mati\u00e8re de service de garde et que 60 % d\u2019entre eux, ou 31 % de tous les travailleurs par quart de travail, utilisent des services de garde autres que leur \u00e9poux ou leur partenaire. Cependant, il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que les travailleurs par quart ont plus tendance \u00e0 se fier sur les services de garde d\u2019un \u00e9poux, d\u2019un parent ou d\u2019un ami, plut\u00f4t que sur des services de garde offerts par des tiers.\n[333] Le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il y avait plusieurs lacunes importantes dans ce rapport. Toutes les donn\u00e9es qui ont permis \u00e0 M. Moore-Ede de conclure qu\u2019entre 31 % et 52 % des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC demanderaient la m\u00eame mesure d\u2019accommodement que Mme Johnstone d\u00e9coulent de r\u00e9ponses de 32 000 travailleurs par quart \u00e0 la question no 13 de son questionnaire Circadian qui se trouvent \u00e0 l\u2019addenda C de son rapport \u00e9crit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve.\n[334] L\u2019\u00e9chantillonnage des r\u00e9pondants est compos\u00e9 de travailleurs des \u00c9tats-Unis et du Canada, mais le pourcentage canadien est tr\u00e8s faible. Aucun questionnaire ou sondage n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC, parce que M. Moore\u2011Ede a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019ASFC ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai d\u2019ex\u00e9cution suffisant et ne lui avait pas pay\u00e9 un salaire suffisant pour effectuer ce type d\u2019exercice.\n[335] La question sur laquelle sa conclusion est fond\u00e9e, la question no 13, est la suivante :\n[Traduction]\na) Quel service de garde principal utilisez-vous pr\u00e9sentement?\nService de garde enregistr\u00e9 Des parents Votre \u00e9poux ou votre partenaire Autre Ne s\u2019applique pas (aucun enfant \u00e0 la maison)\n[336] La question ne traite pas des sous-ensembles, tels que les enfants d\u2019\u00e2ge pr\u00e9scolaire par opposition aux enfants et aux adolescents qui habitent toujours \u00e0 la maison.\n[337] De plus, lorsque M. Moore-Ede a utilis\u00e9 les chiffres pour extrapoler, il n\u2019a pas seulement extrapol\u00e9 les r\u00e9ponses de ceux qui disaient utiliser des services de garde offerts par des tiers, mais de tous les r\u00e9pondants qui avaient des enfants \u00e0 la maison, peu importe qu\u2019ils aient indiqu\u00e9 que leur \u00e9poux, leur famille, des tiers ou d\u2019autres offraient les services de garde. Rien ne permet de conclure que tous les parents demanderaient des mesures d\u2019accommodement, peu importe l\u2019\u00e2ge de leur enfant et peu importent les ententes en mati\u00e8re des services de garde qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0.\n[338] De plus, M. Moore-Ede n\u2019avait pas de mod\u00e8le de donn\u00e9es li\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s qui travaillaient par quarts de travail rotatifs et dont le partenaire ou l\u2019\u00e9poux travaillait aussi par quarts de travail rotatifs. D\u2019autres preuves pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cette situation ne s\u2019appliquait qu\u2019\u00e0 1,2 % de la population des employ\u00e9s qui travaillent par quart.\n[339] Les conclusions de M. Moore-Ede \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur la croyance qu\u2019il y aurait un effet d\u2019entra\u00eenement si la demande de Mme Johnstone \u00e9tait accueillie, d\u00e9coulant du m\u00e9contentement des employ\u00e9s qui n\u2019avaient pas de mesures d\u2019accommodement et qui auraient n\u00e9cessairement obtenu les quarts de travail et les heures de travail les moins d\u00e9sirables.\n[340] M. Moore-Ede a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le sc\u00e9nario susmentionn\u00e9 entra\u00eenerait de la malhonn\u00eatet\u00e9 et que les employ\u00e9s [Traduction] joueraient des jeux dans lesquels ils se cr\u00e9eraient des sc\u00e9narios d\u2019accommodement pour prendre soin de leurs enfants afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019exigence leur permettant d\u2019obtenir des quarts et des heures de travail pr\u00e9f\u00e9rables.\n[341] \u00c9videmment, une op\u00e9ration qui fonctionne 24 heures par jour 7 jours par semaine en fonction de quarts rotatifs ne pourrait pas se permettre que la moiti\u00e9 de son effectif ne respecte pas l\u2019EPHV. Cependant, l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se de M. Moore-Ede ne d\u00e9coule pas d\u2019exp\u00e9riences r\u00e9elles \u00e0 ce jour des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019ASFC dans la gestion. Les chiffres que M. Moore-Ede a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s ne sont pas r\u00e9alistes et ils sont fond\u00e9s soit sur des d\u00e9tails inad\u00e9quats de la question sur laquelle il s\u2019est fond\u00e9 pour valider ces chiffres, soit sur des hypoth\u00e8ses non prouv\u00e9es qui font douter de l\u2019\u00e9thique et de la motivation de l\u2019effectif qui a r\u00e9pondu au sondage.\n[342] M. Moore-Ede n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de l\u2019effet de l\u2019\u00e9ducation des employ\u00e9s en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment important. Aucune preuve de fond n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal selon laquelle l\u2019effectif en question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne peut pas \u00eatre form\u00e9 au sujet des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui justifient l\u2019approbation de certaines demandes d\u2019accommodement.\n[343] Il convient de noter que Mme Johnstone demandait une mesure d\u2019accommodement temporaire pour ses enfants qui \u00e9taient d\u2019\u00e2ge pr\u00e9scolaire. Elle avait l\u2019intention de retourner au travail \u00e0 temps plein en 2010. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une demande permanente d\u2019accommodement, comme c\u2019est le cas pour certaines demandes d\u2019accommodement pour raisons religieuse, ni d\u2019une situation d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de longue dur\u00e9e.\n[344] M. Moore-Ede ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9 aux rapports des experts de Mme Johnstone portant sur le manque de disponibilit\u00e9 de services de garde offerts par des tiers et a souscrit en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 leurs conclusions.\n[345] M. Moore-Ede a reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas tenu compte des effets compensatoires des \u00e9conomies de co\u00fbts qui d\u00e9coulent de mesures d\u2019accommodement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la r\u00e9duction de l\u2019absent\u00e9isme, des cong\u00e9s de maladie, des demandes de cong\u00e9, etc., lorsque les employ\u00e9s qui ont demand\u00e9 l\u2019accommodement sont plus satisfaits de leur environnement de travail qui r\u00e9pond, ou qui s\u2019efforce de r\u00e9pondre, \u00e0 leurs besoins temporaires.\n[346] M. Moore-Ede a aussi reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas tenu compte de la diff\u00e9rence entre le Canada et les \u00c9tats-Unis en ce qui a trait au fait que le gouvernement du Canada offre un filet de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 aux jeunes parents gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l\u2019existence du cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 et du cong\u00e9 parental d\u2019un an \u2013 chose qui n\u2019est pas offerte aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Donc, alors que les parents aux \u00c9tats-Unis peuvent avoir besoin de trouver un service de garde pour un enfant qui a seulement 2 mois, au Canada, cela n\u2019arrive g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas avant que l\u2019enfant ait 1 an. Cela r\u00e9duit le besoin g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de services de garde pour les enfants de 1 \u00e0 5 ans, par opposition aux enfants nouveau-n\u00e9s jusqu\u2019\u00e0 5 ans.\n[347] De plus, M. Moore-Ede suppose que les employ\u00e9s qui ont des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales demanderaient des quarts de travail de jour, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire des heures qui correspondent avec les services de garde. Il a d\u00e9duit de ce fait qu\u2019il y aurait des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives en terme de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour les employ\u00e9s qui ne font pas l\u2019objet de mesures d\u2019accommodement. Cela contredit toute autre preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal. Mme Johnstone elle-m\u00eame n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de quarts de travail de jour. Elle a propos\u00e9 de prendre les quarts de travail d\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi.\nVII. Conclusions\/Analyse [348] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation des employeurs en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement est une obligation juridique fondamentale. Un employeur doit d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination est n\u00e9cessaire pour respecter un objectif l\u00e9gitime de travail et doit pr\u00e9senter une preuve directe qu\u2019il a atteint une contrainte excessive dans ses efforts pour accommoder les besoins de l\u2019employ\u00e9.\n[349] Aussi dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019 [\u00e0] moins qu\u2019aucun accommodement ne soit possible sans imposer une contrainte excessive, la norme telle qu\u2019elle existe n\u2019est pas une EPJ, et la preuve prima facie de l\u2019existence de discrimination n\u2019est pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9e.\n[350] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences c. Via Rail Canada Inc., [2007] A.C.F. no 15 (Via Rail), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019 [i]l y a contrainte excessive lorsque les moyens raisonnables d\u2019accommoder ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9puis\u00e9s et qu\u2019il ne reste que des options d\u2019accommodement d\u00e9raisonnables ou irr\u00e9alistes.\n[351] Ces arr\u00eats \u00e9tablissent de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s \u00e9vidente une obligation de la part de l\u2019ASFC de faire de r\u00e9els efforts pour accommoder, efforts qui sont tangibles et mesurables et qui \u00e9valuent la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019employeur de r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d\u2019accommodement. L\u2019ASFC ne doit pas fonder son \u00e9valuation sur la question de savoir si l\u2019employ\u00e9 a besoin d\u2019accommodement ou si elle peut prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement, sur des [Traduction] hypoth\u00e8ses relevant de l\u2019impression.\n[352] Les employeurs ont la directive claire de d\u00e9ployer tous les efforts raisonnables et de donner aux employ\u00e9s toutes les occasions raisonnables, sans se fonder sur des hypoth\u00e8ses relevant d\u2019impressions motivant des politiques non \u00e9crites mises en pratique pour d\u2019autres motifs.\n[353] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights)\u00b8 [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [l]a preuve, constitu\u00e9e d\u2019impressions, d\u2019une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement.\n[354] G\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, la contrainte excessive signifie disproportionn\u00e9, ill\u00e9gitime, immod\u00e9r\u00e9, excessif ou oppressif [\u2026] (Via Rail).\n[355] Compte tenu du fait que les \u00e9valuations de rendement de Mme Johnstone \u00e9taient unanimes et positives et compte tenu du fait qu\u2019elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir souvent travaill\u00e9 pendant de longs quarts de travail en raison des exigences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, le Tribunal accepte qu\u2019il n\u2019y aurait eu aucune pr\u00e9occupation de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 viable d\u00e9coulant du fait que Mme Johnstone aurait travaill\u00e9 pendant des quarts de 13 heures.\n[356] Il est r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur que malgr\u00e9 l\u2019extrapolation num\u00e9rique de M. Moore-Ede, qui pr\u00e9tendait que la moiti\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019ASFC au TAP auraient demand\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019accommodement en raison de leur situation de famille, Mme Raby ne se souvenait pas d\u2019une autre demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e entre 2002 et l\u2019audience et M. Sheridan ne pouvait se souvenir que d\u2019un seul cas. Ce t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience r\u00e9elle de la gestion avec l\u2019effectif particulier de l\u2019ASFC p\u00e8se lourd contre la th\u00e9orie de M. Moore\u2011Ede.\n[357] Sauf pour le rapport de 2009 de M. Moore-Ede, aucune analyse n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e, aucune enqu\u00eate scientifique n\u2019a eu lieu, aucun consultant n\u2019a examin\u00e9 les questions d\u2019accommodement, aucune politique n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place, soit depuis la d\u00e9cision Brown de 1993, soit depuis la directive de la CCDP 10 ans plus tard exigeant que des politiques soient \u00e9labor\u00e9es.\n[358] Le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle avait une EPJ et n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un argument suffisant au sujet de la contrainte excessive pour s\u2019acquitter de son fardeau. L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 si elle pouvait prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour les responsabilit\u00e9s familiales de Mme Johnstone. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas prendre de mesures d\u2019accommodement pour Mme Johnstone en raison de contraintes excessives.\n[359] Le Tribunal a confirm\u00e9 avec les t\u00e9moins tant de la plaignante que de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ainsi qu\u2019avec l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qu\u2019aucune des propositions de l\u2019\u00e9bauche de politique d\u2019accommodement, y compris la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019un fonds national des am\u00e9nagements sp\u00e9ciaux, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en application. Durant toute l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales en toutes circonstances n\u2019entra\u00eenent pas une obligation d\u2019accommodement en raison de la situation de famille, un motif de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la LCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a donc aucune politique \u00e9crite en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement pour cette disposition de la LCDP et ses politiques non \u00e9crites son telles qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci\u2011dessus : l\u2019ASFC permet \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui demande des quarts de travail fixes en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s parentales d\u2019obtenir un tel quart de travail l\u2019exemptant de l\u2019EPHV, mais exige que cet employ\u00e9 ne travaille pas plus de 34 heures par semaine, \u00e0 temps partiel.\n[360] L\u2019importance d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019historique \u00e0 la partie III de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision visait \u00e0 montrer que pendant environ 25 ans, le TCDP, la CCDP et diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9canismes au sein de la fonction publique du gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral (certains internes \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e m\u00eame), ont reconnu le besoin de r\u00e9pondre aux questions d\u2019\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie personnelle qui d\u00e9coulent naturellement du fait que certains employ\u00e9s sont des parents et ont des obligations envers leurs enfants qui ne sont pas compatibles avec les quarts de travail \u00e9tablis r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement en vertu de l\u2019EPHV ou des r\u00e9gimes semblables. De telles obligations parentales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnues ailleurs, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, en vertu du motif de la situation de famille \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la LCDP.\n[361] Compte tenu de la totalit\u00e9 de la preuve et de l\u2019admission des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e faisant partie de sa direction, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019y a eu aucune tentative de sensibilisation au sujet des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne portant sur la situation de famille tant pour les gestionnaires que pour les employ\u00e9s, ni de gestion d\u2019une r\u00e9sistance per\u00e7ue ou r\u00e9elle parmi les employ\u00e9s qui pourraient ne pas tirer un avantage direct des mesures d\u2019accommodement en un temps donn\u00e9. La preuve des t\u00e9moins gestionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a montr\u00e9 une compr\u00e9hension tr\u00e8s superficielle et nominale des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait eu aucune formation ou sensibilisation au sujet des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019affaire Brown, ou de la v\u00e9rification effectu\u00e9e par la CCDP susmentionn\u00e9e, dans leur qualification des soins aux enfants et de l\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants comme facteurs qui justifient un accommodement en vertu de la LCDP.\n[362] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas effectu\u00e9 d\u2019examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es et des options qui n\u2019impliquent pas une contrainte excessive. La preuve en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral indique fortement que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pris ces mesures parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas reconnu la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de le faire. En d\u2019autres mots, si le point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon lequel les obligations parentales envers les jeunes enfants ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille au sens de la LCDP est juste, alors il n\u2019y a aucune raison de prendre des mesures. Le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert M. Moore-Ede pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tude du genre entreprise pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin de justifier ou d\u2019expliquer son point de vue.\n[363] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait facilement pu cr\u00e9er des politiques \u00e9crites, transparentes et justes qui se seraient appliqu\u00e9es uniform\u00e9ment et qui auraient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une compr\u00e9hension r\u00e9elle des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et de leur application en ce qui concerne le motif de distinction illicite de situation de famille. De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait pu traiter ouvertement les cas uniques \u00e0 mesure qu\u2019ils se pr\u00e9sentaient, ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a reconnu ne pas avoir fait, en suivant les m\u00e9canismes existants. Les t\u00e9moins gestionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont reconnu que ces m\u00e9canismes sont plut\u00f4t r\u00e9serv\u00e9s pour les employ\u00e9s qui demandent des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour raisons m\u00e9dicales et religieuses seulement, avec quelques exceptions.\n[364] Comme le Tribunal a conclu que la plainte de Mme Johnstone est fond\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille, il est important qu\u2019elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie d\u2019une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de ses besoins en mati\u00e8re d\u2019accommodement.\nVIII. D\u00e9cision [365] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal conclut que la plainte de Mme Johnstone est fond\u00e9e :\nMme Johnstone a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination par l\u2019ASFC au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP, fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille; Mme Johnstone a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie que l\u2019ASFC a fix\u00e9 et a appliqu\u00e9 des lignes de conduite susceptibles d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement de la plaignante et de tout autre individu dans la m\u00eame situation, en raison de sa situation de famille, au sens de l\u2019article 10 de la LCDP; L\u2019ASFC n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019explication raisonnable ou ou d\u2019autre justification \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie contre elle.\nIX. Le redressement A. Mesure de redressement syst\u00e9mique [366] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de cesser ses pratiques discriminatoires fond\u00e9es sur la situation de famille contre les employ\u00e9s qui demandent des mesures d\u2019accommodement en raison de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s parentales et de consulter la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, afin de mettre en place un plan pour \u00e9viter d\u2019autres incidents de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[367] Afin que Mme Johnstone et d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s dans sa situation ne soient pas priv\u00e9s d\u2019occasions d\u2019emploi \u00e0 venir, de salaires et d\u2019avantages, le Tribunal ordonne aussi \u00e0 l\u2019ASFC d\u2019\u00e9tablir des politiques \u00e9crites qui satisferont Mme Johnstone et la CCDP, afin de traiter les demandes d\u2019accommodement pour la situation de famille, dans les six mois suivant la d\u00e9cision et que ces politiques devront comprendre un processus pour une \u00e9valuation individuelle de chaque employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentant une telle demande.\n[368] Mme Johnstone demande le remboursement de toutes les pertes de salaires et d\u2019avantages, y compris le temps suppl\u00e9mentaire, qu\u2019elle aurait re\u00e7us ainsi que la contribution \u00e0 sa pension qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en fonction d\u2019un horaire \u00e0 temps plein si elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de travailler \u00e0 temps partiel. Elle demande aussi une ordonnance afin qu\u2019elle puisse faire des contributions \u00e0 sa pension \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 partir d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2007.\n[369] Mme Johnstone a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps partiel le 4 janvier 2004. Par la suite, sauf pour son deuxi\u00e8me cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 du 24 d\u00e9cembre 2004 jusqu\u2019au 26 d\u00e9cembre 2005, elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel. Pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 temps partiel, la preuve d\u00e9montre que son salaire et ses avantages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s au prorata. Son salaire et ses avantages ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9s au prorata au taux \u00e0 temps partiel alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9.\n[370] Du 14 ao\u00fbt 2007 jusqu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 2008, Mme Johnstone a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 sans solde pour r\u00e9installation de conjoint en raison de la mutation de son mari \u00e0 Ottawa. Ce cong\u00e9 s\u2019est termin\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2008. Pendant ce cong\u00e9, Mme Johnstone a pu contribuer \u00e0 sa pension \u00e0 un taux calcul\u00e9 au prorata de 20 heures par semaine.\n[371] Depuis ao\u00fbt 2008, Mme Johnstone est en cong\u00e9 sans solde pour les soins et l\u2019\u00e9ducation de ses enfants conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective.\n[372] Mme Johnstone a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle avait fait des choix au sujet du nombre d\u2019heures qu\u2019elle avait travaill\u00e9es en raison du refus de l\u2019ASFC de lui permettre de travailler \u00e0 temps plein, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la perte du salaire \u00e0 temps plein, de ses avantages et des occasions d\u2019emploi. Sa d\u00e9claration selon laquelle elle [Traduction] aurait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019organiser si elle avait pu travailler \u00e0 temps plein apr\u00e8s la naissance de son deuxi\u00e8me enfant n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e.\n[373] Mme Johnstone a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 (voir le paragraphe 106 ci\u2011dessus) qu\u2019elle aurait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 temps plein malgr\u00e9 la mutation de son mari.\n[374] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, les avocats des parties ont sembl\u00e9 avoir confiance de pouvoir s\u2019entendre sur le montant qui devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Johnstone si le Tribunal ordonnait qu\u2019elle soit indemnis\u00e9e sous cette rubrique.\n[375] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne que Mme Johnstone soit indemnis\u00e9e pour sa perte de salaire et d\u2019avantages sociaux, y compris les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires qu\u2019elle aurait effectu\u00e9es et les contributions \u00e0 sa pension qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 faites si elle avait pu travailler \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 partir du 4 janvier 2004 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour. L\u2019ordonnance comprend la directive que Mme Johnstone puisse effectuer des contributions \u00e0 sa pension \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein pour cette p\u00e9riode. Mme Johnstone n\u2019a pas droit aux pertes de salaire d\u00e9coulant de sa pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour pr\u00e9judice moral [376] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Johnstone a clairement montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a subi un pr\u00e9judice sur les plans de sa personne, de sa confiance personnelle et professionnelle et de sa r\u00e9putation professionnelle, d\u00e9coulant de la discrimination qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\n[377] Mme Johnstone a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle se sentait embarrass\u00e9e par le fait qu\u2019on la qualifiait de dossier [Traduction] de droits de la personne et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 boulevers\u00e9e par la fa\u00e7on arbitraire dont on l\u2019a trait\u00e9e malgr\u00e9 tous les efforts qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour trouver une fa\u00e7on de cr\u00e9er un \u00e9quilibre fonctionnel entre le travail qu\u2019elle dit vraiment aimer et ses jeunes enfants.\n[378] J\u2019accorde \u00e0 Mme Johnstone 15 000 $ sous cette rubrique, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP.\nC. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale [379] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale pour un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, d\u2019un maximum de 20 000 $. Bien qu\u2019il eut \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9 avant les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la LCDP en 1998, alors que le montant accord\u00e9 pour les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sous la rubrique du pr\u00e9judice moral et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00e9tait plus bas, le Tribunal se fonde quand m\u00eame sur la raisonnabilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du TCDP Martin, qui a suivi le raisonnement de la d\u00e9cision Premakumar c. Air Canada, 1re inst. 03\/02, et de l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan, [1991] 2 C.F. 401 (C.A.F.), selon lequel le montant maximal est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux cas les plus graves\n[380] Le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019ASFC, en ne tenant pas compte des nombreux efforts externes et internes visant \u00e0 apporter un changement \u00e0 ces politiques quant aux mesures d\u2019accommodement pour la situation de famille, a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment refus\u00e9 la protection \u00e0 ceux qui en avaient besoin.\n[381] Le manque d\u2019effort et de souci de l\u2019ASFC et de ses pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseurs a pris plusieurs formes au cours des ann\u00e9es, y compris : le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas tenu compte de la d\u00e9cision Brown apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9crit la lettre d\u2019excuses; le fait d\u2019avoir \u00e9labor\u00e9 une \u00e9bauche de politique et de l\u2019avoir fait dispara\u00eetre (certains gestionnaires \u00e9taient au courant, d\u2019autres pas); l\u2019application des politiques arbitraires non \u00e9crites et appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on non uniforme; le manque de formation en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, m\u00eame au niveau de la haute direction; la pr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019argument de l\u2019avalanche des demandes cinq ans apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, en plus du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas donn\u00e9 suffisamment de temps et de donn\u00e9es \u00e0 son expert pour lui permettre de pr\u00e9senter un avis d\u2019expert utile; le fait que personne n\u2019a tent\u00e9 de demander \u00e0 Mme Johnstone quelle \u00e9tait sa situation particuli\u00e8re ou de l\u2019aviser des options qui lui permettraient de combler ses besoins.\n[382] Compte tenu de toutes les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal accorde \u00e0 Mme Johnstone 20 000 $ sous cette rubrique. Le comportement de l\u2019ASFC a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9, ne tenant pas compte de la situation de Mme Johnstone et refusant d\u2019admettre que l\u2019ASFC avait une obligation d\u2019accommodement pour la situation de famille d\u00e9coulant des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales comme celles de Mme Johnstone.\nD. Int\u00e9r\u00eat [383] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP, le Tribunal ordonne que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9 au taux des bons d\u2019\u00e9pargne du Canada soit pay\u00e9 sur tous les montants accord\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sous les rubriques des indemnit\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9rales pour pr\u00e9judice moral conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\nE. D\u00e9pens avocat-client [384] Mme Johnstone a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par une conseill\u00e8re juridique principale, qui avait de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience en droits de la personne et dans la structure organisationnelle de la fonction publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L\u2019expertise de l\u2019avocate lui a permis de pr\u00e9senter pleinement le dossier de la plaignante devant le Tribunal et a fait partie int\u00e9grante du succ\u00e8s de la plaignante. En raison de la nature conflictuelle des d\u00e9cisions et ordonnances ant\u00e9rieures des cours sur le motif de situation de famille \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la LCDP ainsi que de la nature unique et complexe des op\u00e9rations de l\u2019ASFC, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile pour une personne de pr\u00e9senter ce dossier sans l\u2019assistance d\u2019un avocat.\n[385] Cependant, dans un arr\u00eat rendu le 26 octobre 2009, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le TCDP ne peut pas indemniser les victimes de discrimination pour les d\u00e9pens en s\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. [Canada (P.G.) c. Mowat 2009 CAF 309]. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que l\u2019article 53 ne donne pas au Tribunal le pouvoir expr\u00e8s d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sous cette rubrique.\n[386] Aux paragraphes 101 et 102 de la d\u00e9cision, la juge Layden\u2011Stevenson, appuy\u00e9e par le juge L\u00e9trourneau et le juge Sexton, a conclu :\n[101] Ce sont des questions qui exigent l\u2019examen du l\u00e9gislateur, par exemple, l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019adjuger des d\u00e9pens et, s\u2019il y a lieu, les modalit\u00e9s d\u2019une telle mesure ainsi que les limites n\u00e9cessaires. Le r\u00f4le de l\u2019avocat de la Commission peut constituer un facteur \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration, vu qu\u2019il a beaucoup chang\u00e9 dans le processus de d\u00e9cision au fil des ans. Pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a comparu \u00e0 la plupart des audiences devant le Tribunal, mais cette pratique semble avoir chang\u00e9. L\u2019ancienne proc\u00e9dure a pu influencer la d\u00e9cision du l\u00e9gislateur concernant l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019adjuger des d\u00e9pens dans les instances en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne. L\u2019avocat de la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2003 celle-ci a r\u00e9examin\u00e9 son interpr\u00e9tation de son r\u00f4le sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019article 51 de la LCDP. Enfin, s\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019adjuger des d\u00e9pens, il faut d\u00e9terminer la nature du r\u00e9gime des d\u00e9pens. Il existe plusieurs permutations possibles. [102] La d\u00e9cision finale et les choix de principe inh\u00e9rents qu\u2019elle implique appartiennent au l\u00e9gislateur, non au Tribunal ou \u00e0 la cour.\n[387] Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019est accord\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante sous cette rubrique.\nF. Maintien de la comp\u00e9tence [388] Le Tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence pour six mois suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, au cas o\u00f9 les parties seraient incapables de s\u2019entendre sur le montant de la rubrique des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques ou seraient incapables de s\u2019entendre au sujet de l\u2019application de l\u2019une des mesures de redressement. Si une prorogation de cette p\u00e9riode est n\u00e9cessaire, des observations devront \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une prorogation.\nSign\u00e9e par\nKerry-Lynne D.

Quels sont les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Khalifa dans sa plainte?\nII.

Quel est l'\u00e9tat du droit concernant la plainte de Mme Khalifa pour harc\u00e8lement?\nA. Mme Khalifa a-t-elle rempli toutes les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour fonder sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement?\n[1] Melissa Khalifa pr\u00e9tend que du fait de sa situation de famille de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire de quatre enfants, P\u00e9trole et gaz des Indiens du Canada (PGIC) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit dans le cadre de son emploi, ce qui a conduit \u00e0 son renvoi. Elle affirme \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement dans le cadre de son emploi pour le m\u00eame motif de discrimination.\n[2] Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'ai d'abord expos\u00e9 les faits tels que Mme Khalifa les a relat\u00e9s, ce qui m'a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure qu'elle avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination prouvant que son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait discriminatoire en application de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). J'ai ensuite examin\u00e9 les explications de PGIC, que j'estime \u00eatre raisonnables et non fond\u00e9es sur des pr\u00e9textes. Pour finir, j'ai examin\u00e9 la plainte pour harc\u00e8lement que Mme Khalifa a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application de l'article 14 de la LCDP et j'ai conclu que les \u00e9v\u00e8nements auxquels elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ne constituaient pas du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP.\nI. Quels sont les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Khalifa dans sa plainte? [3] PGIC est charg\u00e9e de la gestion et de l'administration des ressources p\u00e9troli\u00e8res et gazi\u00e8res sur les terres des r\u00e9serves des Premi\u00e8res nations. Il s'agit d'un organisme sp\u00e9cial relevant du minist\u00e8re des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien. Entre le 25 octobre 2002 et le 2 ao\u00fbt 2005, Mme Khalifa a rempli diverses fonctions dans les bureaux de PGIC situ\u00e9s au sud de Calgary. Toutefois, tout au long de cette p\u00e9riode, elle n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 proprement parler employ\u00e9e par PGIC, mais plut\u00f4t par l'agence de placement Spirit Staffing and Consulting Inc. (Spirit).\n[4] Lors de l'audience, PGIC a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal qu'elle n'all\u00e9guerait pas que les conditions d'emploi de Mme Khalifa privaient le Tribunal de sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plainte. J'en conclus que PGIC accepte par cons\u00e9quent que sa relation avec Mme Khalifa soit qualifi\u00e9e de relation d' emploi au sens des articles 7 et 14 de la LCDP.\n[5] Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada a attribu\u00e9 une offre \u00e0 commandes \u00e0 Spirit afin que celle-ci fournisse au gouvernement du Canada des travailleurs temporaires. Ainsi, des organismes gouvernementaux, tels que PGIC, avaient le pouvoir de [TRADUCTION] passer commande de travailleurs temporaires aupr\u00e8s de Spirit en fonction de leurs besoins ponctuels.\n[6] Mme Khalifa a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 PGIC afin d'y remplir les fonctions de r\u00e9ceptionniste au sein de la division des services professionnels et des services aux entreprises. PGIC a renouvel\u00e9 le premier contrat de Mme Khalifa, lui demandant finalement de remplacer l'agent administratif de la division de la production, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 ailleurs. La division de la production \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9e par le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la production, Bill Currie.\n[7] En 2004, M. Currie a \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral (PDG) par int\u00e9rim de PGIC, poste relevant de la haute direction de l'organisme. Le poste d'agent administratif du PDG \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pourvu. Aux dires de Mme Khalifa, le 12 octobre 2004, M. Currie l'a n\u00e9anmoins [TRADUCTION] emmen\u00e9e avec lui \u00e0 la haute direction, pour qu'elle y travaille sous la supervision d'un autre directeur. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9e de t\u00e2ches relatives aux communications, de la production de rapports annuels ainsi que de toute autre t\u00e2che que M. Currie aurait pu lui demander d'accomplir.\n[8] Au d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e 2005, M. Currie a repris son poste de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la production. En f\u00e9vrier 2005, il a pass\u00e9 en entrevue et engag\u00e9, \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9e \u00e0 temps plein de PGIC, sa nouvelle assistante administrative, Laurie Murphy. Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que M. Currie ait alors eu une assistante administrative \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 la division de la production, il avait tout de m\u00eame fait en sorte que Mme Khalifa revienne \u00e9galement travailler pour lui dans cette m\u00eame division, \u00e0 partir du 1er avril 2005. Le contrat devait prendre fin le 19 ao\u00fbt 2005. Selon les termes dudit contrat, Mme Murphy \u00e9tait la superviseure d\u00e9sign\u00e9e de Mme Khalifa.\n[9] Mme Khalifa affirme avoir, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, remis en question le fait que ses services soient encore requis dans la division, compte tenu des fonctions que Mme Murphy remplissait d\u00e9j\u00e0, mais M. Currie a conseill\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa de continuer \u00e0 travailler selon les termes du nouveau contrat, sans rien changer. Elle a suivi ses conseils et a \u00e9t\u00e9 agr\u00e9ablement surprise de se voir attribuer des projets qui lui plaisaient. En outre, en plus des fonctions qu'elle devait accomplir pour le compte de la division de la production, Mme Khalifa effectuait aussi des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour le compte des divisions de la haute direction et des terres; il s'agissait de t\u00e2ches qui lui plaisaient beaucoup \u00e9galement.\n[10] Par opposition, Mme Khalifa affirme avoir observ\u00e9, autour de la fin avril 2005, que Mme Murphy n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaite de son poste et des t\u00e2ches administratives plut\u00f4t banales qu'on lui demandait d'accomplir, comme l'organisation des d\u00e9placements de M. Currie. Selon Mme Khalifa, Mme Murphy \u00e9tait jalouse des t\u00e2ches attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Khalifa, et elle a exprim\u00e9 son m\u00e9contentement en formulant des commentaires discriminatoires \u00e0 l'endroit de cette derni\u00e8re, relativement \u00e0 sa situation de famille. Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire de quatre enfants, dont trois \u00e9taient encore mineurs \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Elle devait parfois s'absenter du bureau pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 leur \u00e9ducation ou \u00e0 leur sant\u00e9. De plus, un de ses enfants souffrait de troubles d'apprentissage, ce qui exigeait parfois de Mme Khalifa qu'elle l'accompagne \u00e0 des rendez-vous avec divers sp\u00e9cialistes.\n[11] Un jour de la fin avril 2005, Mme Khalifa a d\u00fb s'absenter de son travail pour r\u00e9gler un probl\u00e8me d'ordre scolaire concernant un de ses enfants. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que quand elle avait par la suite inform\u00e9 Mme Murphy (qui occupait le cubicule voisin du sien) de ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9, Mme Murphy avait r\u00e9agi en lui disant qu'en tant que m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire, elle devrait envisager de chercher un emploi ailleurs, dans un endroit [TRADUCTION] qui conviendrait mieux \u00e0 une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire.\n[12] Mme Khalifa affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tellement [TRADUCTION] outr\u00e9e par ce commentaire qu'elle s'est imm\u00e9diatement lev\u00e9e pour se rendre dans le bureau de Darryl Jaques, qui occupait le poste d'ing\u00e9nieur principal \u00e0 PGIC. Le bureau de M. Jaques se trouvait de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 du couloir. Mme Khalifa a ferm\u00e9 la porte et lui a dit : [TRADUCTION] Savez-vous ce que Laurie Murphy vient de me dire?, avant de lui r\u00e9p\u00e9ter le commentaire de Mme Murphy. Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Jaques lui avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de faire part de la situation directement \u00e0 M. Currie.\n[13] Mme Khalifa a appel\u00e9 M. Jaques \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner lors de l'audition de sa plainte. Celui-ci se rappelait avoir entendu Mme Khalifa se plaindre des [TRADUCTION] moments difficiles qu'elle vivait sous la supervision de Mme Murphy, mais il ne se rappelait pas qu'elle lui ait jamais dit que Mme Murphy avait formul\u00e9 des remarques au sujet de son statut de m\u00e8re monoparentale.\n[14] Mme Khalifa a affirm\u00e9 qu'un jour ou deux apr\u00e8s ces \u00e9v\u00e8nements, elle avait r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie la remarque de Mme Murphy et qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] sid\u00e9r\u00e9e par la r\u00e9ponse qu'il lui avait faite. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu que M. Currie avait laiss\u00e9 entendre qu'il se pouvait que Mme Murphy ait les int\u00e9r\u00eats de Mme Khalifa \u00e0 cur et que le fait de [TRADUCTION] chercher du travail ailleurs puisse \u00eatre une bonne option compte tenu de sa [TRADUCTION] situation familiale. Mme Khalifa n'a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 contente d'entendre M. Currie lui demander ensuite quels \u00e9taient les arrangements qu'elle avait pris concernant la garde de ses enfants pendant l'\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 venir. Mme Khalifa lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle ferait appel \u00e0 temps plein aux services de garderie auxquels elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 recours apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9cole. Elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9contente du fait que M. Currie n'ait pas examin\u00e9 les remarques formul\u00e9es par Mme Murphy de mani\u00e8re satisfaisante lors de cette rencontre.\n[15] Mme Khalifa a pr\u00e9tendu qu'apr\u00e8s avoir eu cette discussion avec M. Currie, elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se faire une id\u00e9e de ce qu'il pensait de sa situation de famille. Elle en a \u00e9t\u00e9 surprise \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'avant que Mme Murphy formule son commentaire, elle n'avait jamais entendu personne exprimer d'inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet du fait qu'elle \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire.\n[16] Dans les mois qui ont suivi cet incident, Mme Khalifa a remarqu\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 chaque fois qu'elle \u00e9voquait une activit\u00e9 concernant ses enfants, Mme Murphy soupirait bruyamment ou levait les yeux au ciel. En juin 2005, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu Mme Murphy soupirer de nouveau en pareille occasion, Mme Khalifa lui a demand\u00e9 des explications. Mme Khalifa a fait remarquer \u00e0 Mme Murphy qu'elle avait elle aussi un enfant et elle lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi sa situation devrait \u00eatre per\u00e7ue diff\u00e9remment de la sienne. Mme Murphy lui aurait r\u00e9pondu que dans son cas, il \u00e9tait acceptable qu'elle travaille parce qu'elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait du soutien de son mari, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de Mme Khalifa.\n[17] Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'une autre fois, M. Currie l'avait invit\u00e9e dans son bureau, mais le t\u00e9moignage relatif \u00e0 cette rencontre n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s clair. Elle a sembl\u00e9 dire que M. Currie lui avait alors pos\u00e9 des questions d'ordre personnel, y compris au sujet de l'endroit o\u00f9 elle habitait, et qu'il lui aurait dit qu'il savait \u00e0 quel point il \u00e9tait difficile d'\u00eatre une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire.\n[18] \u00c0 la suite de cette conversation, Mme Khalifa a apparemment rencontr\u00e9 Susan McCurdie, qui \u00e9tait la conseill\u00e8re en ressources humaines de PGIC. Lorsqu'elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, Mme Khalifa ne se rappelait pas toujours avec pr\u00e9cision de l'encha\u00eenement des \u00e9v\u00e8nements, de sorte qu'il se peut que cette rencontre ait eu lieu avant la conversation qu'elle avait eue avec M. Currie, conversation dont il est question ci dessus. Mme McCurdie \u00e9tait notamment charg\u00e9e de toutes les questions de droit de la personne et de harc\u00e8lement soulev\u00e9es \u00e0 PGIC. Mme Khalifa lui a rapport\u00e9 les questions et commentaires formul\u00e9s par M. Currie et Mme Murphy, et a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une plainte pour harc\u00e8lement. Mme McCurdie lui a dit qu'elle ne pourrait pas accepter de plainte de sa part parce qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas une employ\u00e9e de PGIC, mais un membre du personnel temporaire employ\u00e9 par Spirit. Mme McCurdie a n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9cout\u00e9 le r\u00e9cit de Mme Khalifa. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Khalifa, Mme McCurdie lui aurait r\u00e9pondu que M. Currie, en sa qualit\u00e9 de directeur, aurait d\u00fb savoir qu'il ne fallait surtout pas laisser passer le genre de commentaires formul\u00e9s par Mme Murphy et qu'il n'aurait pas d\u00fb poser \u00e0 Mme Khalifa le genre de questions personnelles qu'il lui a pos\u00e9es.\n[19] Mme McCurdie a ajout\u00e9 que si M. Currie devait lui poser le m\u00eame genre de questions de nouveau, Mme Khalifa devrait lui r\u00e9pondre qu'elle ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l'aise et qu'il ne devrait pas poser de telles questions. Sur les conseils de Mme McCurdie, Mme Khalifa a aussi parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Bryan Potter, qui \u00e9tait directeur des contrats et de l'administration \u00e0 PGIC, et qui \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent charg\u00e9 des contrats d'embauche des membres du personnel temporaire comme Mme Khalifa. M. Potter a confirm\u00e9 que Mme McCurdie n'\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 recevoir une plainte pour harc\u00e8lement de la part de Mme Khalifa. Il a toutefois sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa que consid\u00e9rant ses difficult\u00e9s avec sa superviseure, elle pourrait envisager de chercher du travail ailleurs \u00e0 PGIC.\n[20] Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'attitude de Mme Murphy envers sa situation de famille \u00e9tait devenue tellement perturbante que le 22 juillet 2005, elle \u00e9tait all\u00e9e voir M. Currie en larmes et lui avait dit qu'elle ne pourrait pas supporter la situation plus longtemps et qu'elle voulait s'en aller. Les [TRADUCTION] insinuations, commentaires et questions au sujet de ses enfants lui pesaient. Elle avait effectivement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 douter du fait qu'elle pouvait concilier un travail avec sa situation de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. Il devenait \u00e9vident \u00e0 ses yeux qu'elle ne pouvait s'acquitter correctement de ses t\u00e2ches en raison de ses obligations familiales et elle se sentait mal \u00e0 l'aise. Toutefois, elle a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Murphy, avec sa propension \u00e0 [TRADUCTION] tout exag\u00e9rer en ce qui concernait son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 s'acquitter de ses fonctions, \u00e9tait la source de ses probl\u00e8mes. Au cours de cette rencontre, M. Currie l'a pri\u00e9e de se montrer patiente. Il devait partir en vacances le jour suivant, mais il l'a assur\u00e9e qu'il s'occuperait d'elle \u00e0 son retour.\n[21] Le 2 ao\u00fbt 2005, soit le jour o\u00f9 M. Currie est rentr\u00e9 de vacances, celui ci a pri\u00e9 Mme Khalifa de le rejoindre dans son bureau pour une rencontre. La conversation a \u00e9t\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Khalifa, M. Currie lui a dit que sa situation de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire [TRADUCTION] interf\u00e9rait trop avec son travail et que son contrat prendrait par cons\u00e9quent fin le jour m\u00eame, soit 17 jours avant la fin pr\u00e9vue dudit contrat (le 19 ao\u00fbt 2005). Elle a affirm\u00e9 que M. Currie lui avait alors demand\u00e9 de [TRADUCTION] rassembler ses affaires et de s'en aller. Elle a affirm\u00e9 \u00eatre ensuite retourn\u00e9e dans son cubicule en \u00e9tat de choc. Tandis qu'elle commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 rassembler certaines de ses affaires, elle a remarqu\u00e9 que M. Currie faisait les cent pas devant son cubicule, en jetant des coups d'il \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur. Il lui a sembl\u00e9 difficile de rester plus longtemps; elle a donc quitt\u00e9 les locaux de PGIC en n'emportant que quelques-unes de ses affaires. Elle avait pr\u00e9vu de retourner chercher le reste de ses possessions, mais elle n'a pas pu s'y r\u00e9soudre; elle a donc envoy\u00e9 sa fille \u00e0 sa place.\n[22] Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son rendement \u00e0 PGIC avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaisant ou plus que satisfaisant. \u00c0 l'audience, M. Jaques a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance, le travail de Mme Khalifa n'avait jamais pos\u00e9 probl\u00e8me, ajoutant qu'il l'avait toujours trouv\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] serviable. M. Jaques a d\u00e9j\u00e0 occup\u00e9 le poste de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim de la division de la production, mais il ne se rappelait pas vraiment avoir supervis\u00e9 Mme Khalifa.\n[23] M. Potter, pour sa part, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa avait travaill\u00e9 au sein de sa division au d\u00e9but, quand elle venait d'arriver \u00e0 PGIC, en tant que r\u00e9ceptionniste. Selon lui, elle a fourni un excellent service du temps o\u00f9 elle occupait ce poste. Mme McCurdie a \u00e9t\u00e9 la superviseure de Mme Khalifa pendant environ huit semaines, du temps o\u00f9 Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception. Mme McCurdie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le travail de Mme Khalifa n'avait jamais pos\u00e9 probl\u00e8me, qu'il s'agisse de qualit\u00e9 du service, de ponctualit\u00e9 ou d'assiduit\u00e9.\n[24] Alexandra Steinke est agente des communications \u00e0 PGIC et elle a travaill\u00e9 au sein de la division de la haute direction en m\u00eame temps que Mme Khalifa. Mme Steinke a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa avait \u00e9t\u00e9 capable d'effectuer toutes les t\u00e2ches qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es et qu'elle avait fait du [TRADUCTION] vraiment bon travail. Mme Steinke n'a eu aucun probl\u00e8me concernant l'assiduit\u00e9 de Mme Khalifa et elle croyait savoir que M. Currie [TRADUCTION] avait une tr\u00e8s haute opinion de Mme Khalifa.\n[25] La propri\u00e9taire de Spirit, Janice Larocque, a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que PGIC ne s'\u00e9tait jamais plainte \u00e0 elle de la qualit\u00e9 du travail de Mme Khalifa ou de son assiduit\u00e9. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que selon les termes de l'offre \u00e0 commandes conclue par le gouvernement du Canada avec Spirit, le personnel temporaire ne pouvait pas \u00eatre engag\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode de plus de six mois. Mme Khalifa a travaill\u00e9 pour PGIC de mani\u00e8re continue pendant une p\u00e9riode de presque trois ans, sur diff\u00e9rents contrats, ce qui constitue la plus longue p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle un employ\u00e9 de Spirit a jamais travaill\u00e9 chez un m\u00eame employeur. Mme Laroque a par cons\u00e9quent pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa avait d\u00fb faire du bon travail. Depuis juin 2007, Mme Khalifa travaille dans les bureaux de Spirit et occupe les postes de r\u00e9ceptionniste et de recruteure. Mme Laroque a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait une des employ\u00e9es les plus d\u00e9vou\u00e9es que la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 avait jamais eues, qu'elle effectuait souvent des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et travaillait pendant son heure de repas. Il y avait jamais eu de probl\u00e8me relativement \u00e0 son assiduit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 sa ponctualit\u00e9.\n[26] Mme Khalifa pr\u00e9tend qu'au cours de la derni\u00e8re p\u00e9riode qu'elle a pass\u00e9e chez PGIC, avant qu'on ne mette un terme \u00e0 son contrat, les services qu'elle offrait allaient bien au-del\u00e0 des attentes de ses employeurs. Elle a produit en preuve les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence qu'elle remplissait pour Spirit, sur lesquelles figuraient les heures de travail effectu\u00e9es. Spirit la r\u00e9mun\u00e9rait pour les services rendus en fonction de ces feuilles de pr\u00e9sence. Ces feuilles montraient qu'au cours de 13 semaines sur les 18 semaines pendant lesquelles Mme Khalifa avait travaill\u00e9 pour la division de la production en 2005, elle avait \u00e9galement rempli des feuilles de pr\u00e9sence relatives \u00e0 des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es pour le compte des divisions des terres, de la haute direction et des communications, soit entre 16 et 30 heures pour la plupart des semaines. Elle a effectu\u00e9 ces heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en plus de ses heures de travail normales pendant la semaine.\n[27] Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 s'\u00eatre raisonnablement attendue \u00e0 continuer de travailler pour PGIC apr\u00e8s l'expiration du contrat allant d'avril \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2005, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que plusieurs employ\u00e9s de la section de la comptabilit\u00e9 et de la division des services professionnels (dont Mme Khalifa avait oubli\u00e9 les noms) lui avaient dit qu'un budget \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu pour payer ses services pour le reste de l'exercice, m\u00eame si les contrats devraient quand m\u00eame \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9s toutes les 20 semaines.\n[28] Mme Khalifa soutient par cons\u00e9quent qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ses \u00e9tats de service plus que satisfaisants, la seule explication plausible qu'elle donnait \u00e0 la rupture pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e de son contrat devait \u00eatre li\u00e9e \u00e0 l'attitude de M. Currie et de Mme Murphy envers sa situation de famille de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire d'enfants mineurs. Elle a pr\u00e9tendu \u00e9galement que la conduite de ces derniers constituait du harc\u00e8lement au sens de l'article 14 de la LCDP. J'examinerai chacune de ces deux all\u00e9gations d'acte discriminatoire s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\nII. Quel est l'\u00e9tat du droit concernant la plainte pour discrimination que Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 son renvoi? [29] Aux termes de la LCDP, il est discriminatoire de refuser de continuer d'employer une personne du fait de sa situation de famille (article 3 et alin\u00e9a 7a)).\n[30] Un plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd.,1985 CanLII 18 (C.S.C.), [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O'Malley)). En l'esp\u00e8ce, une preuve prima facie doit appuyer les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es et, si on ajoute foi \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations, la preuve doit \u00eatre compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier qu'un jugement soit rendu en faveur du plaignant en l'absence de r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9. Une fois la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie, il appartient alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations ou de fournir des explications raisonnables.\n[31] Pour que la plainte soit fond\u00e9e, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que les consid\u00e9rations discriminatoires soient le seul motif des actes reproch\u00e9s. Il suffit que la discrimination soit un des facteurs ayant influenc\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, 1995 CanLII 3589 (C.F.), [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (1re inst.)).\n[32] Dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1988) 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029, au paragraphe 38481 (TCDP), le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que rares \u00e9taient les cas de discrimination pratiqu\u00e9s ouvertement. Tout tribunal devrait donc tenir compte de l'ensemble des circonstances en vue d'\u00e9tablir s'il se d\u00e9gage de subtiles odeurs de discrimination.\nA. Mme Khalifa a-t-elle \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination montrant qu'en la cong\u00e9diant le 2 ao\u00fbt 2005, PGIC a commis un acte discriminatoire vis\u00e9 par l'article 7 de la LCDP? [33] Je suis convaincu que Mme Khalifa a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination en ce qui concerne son cong\u00e9diement. La preuve qu'elle a produite \u00e0 l'appui de ses all\u00e9gations, si on y ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour qu'un jugement soit rendu en sa faveur en l'absence de r\u00e9ponse de PGIC.\n[34] Mme Khalifa a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e 17 jours avant la fin pr\u00e9vue de son contrat et elle a affirm\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 ses \u00e9tats de service plus que satisfaisants depuis qu'elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour PGIC ainsi que les informations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es au sujet du fait qu'il y avait un budget suffisant pour payer son salaire jusqu'au 31 mars 2006, il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s'attendre \u00e0 ce que PGIC retienne ses services de nouveau apr\u00e8s l'expiration du contrat de travail qui la liait alors \u00e0 PGIC.\n[35] En outre, Mme Khalifa a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Currie avait ouvertement d\u00e9clar\u00e9, lors de leur derni\u00e8re rencontre, que le motif de son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait que ses responsabilit\u00e9s de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire avaient des r\u00e9percussions sur son travail. Ces commentaires \u00e9taient du m\u00eame ordre que ceux qu'il avait formul\u00e9s lors de rencontres pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, au sujet de la garde des enfants de Mme Khalifa. Pour ces motifs, si on y ajoute foi, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Khalifa est bien une preuve prima facie de discrimination montrant que sa situation de famille a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision ayant conduit \u00e0 mettre fin \u00e0 son contrat pr\u00e9matur\u00e9ment.\nB. PGIC a-t-elle fourni une explication raisonnable pour justifier son comportement par ailleurs discriminatoire? [36] PGIC a affirm\u00e9 que la situation de famille de Mme Khalifa n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans son cong\u00e9diement. PGIC a plut\u00f4t expliqu\u00e9 avoir mis fin au contrat de Mme Khalifa pour les raisons suivantes :\nson incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 satisfaire aux exigences de ponctualit\u00e9 et d'assiduit\u00e9, son rendement en d\u00e9clin, la relation tendue qui s'\u00e9tait cr\u00e9\u00e9e entre elle et le personnel permanent de PGIC (soit sa superviseure, Mme Murphy) et le manque de respect que Mme Khalifa t\u00e9moignait \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re.\n[37] M. Currie a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet du contrat que Mme Khalifa avait obtenu aupr\u00e8s de la division de la production \u00e0 compter du 1er avril 2005. Son contrat pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent devait se terminer le 31 mars 2005. Il n'avait pas l'intention de faire appel \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s temporaires \u00e0 la division de la production. Toutefois, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'un certain nombre de personnes d'autres divisions pour lesquelles Mme Khalifa avait travaill\u00e9 souhaitaient continuer d'avoir recours \u00e0 ses services, mais qu'ils n'avaient pas le budget suffisant pour continuer de l'employer. Ces personnes avaient donc demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie d'engager Mme Khalifa par le truchement de la division de la production, qui disposait d'un budget plus important que les autres divisions, et de financer ses services au moyen de ce budget. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que s'il n'avait pas alors consenti \u00e0 ce que sa division donne les fonds n\u00e9cessaires pour financer les services que Mme Khalifa allait rendre essentiellement \u00e0 d'autres divisions, le contrat de cette derni\u00e8re n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9 et elle aurait cess\u00e9 de travailler pour PGIC le 31 mars 2005.\n[38] Le nouveau contrat de Mme Khalifa a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 et devait couvrir la p\u00e9riode allant du 1er avril 2005 au 19 ao\u00fbt 2005, soit un total de 20 semaines. Elle devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9e \u00e0 un taux horaire de 21,75 $, pour un total de 37,5 heures par semaine. M. Currie a affirm\u00e9 s'\u00eatre attendu \u00e0 ce que Mme Khalifa soit en mesure d'effectuer le travail pour le compte de la division de la production et des autres divisions dans le [TRADUCTION] courant d'une journ\u00e9e de travail normale, en commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 une [TRADUCTION] heure raisonnable, entre 8 h et 9 h. Il lui a fait part de ses attentes, sachant qu'il y aurait une certaine [TRADUCTION] souplesse en ce qui concernait les heures de d\u00e9but et de fin de la journ\u00e9e de travail.\n[39] Quand M. Currie a fait appel aux services de Mme Khalifa, il s'est inqui\u00e9t\u00e9 de la capacit\u00e9 de sa division \u00e0 surveiller les heures de travail de celle-ci. Consid\u00e9rant les nombreuses t\u00e2ches qu'il devait accomplir dans le cadre de ses fonctions de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par le fait qu'il ne serait pas en mesure de superviser ad\u00e9quatement Mme Khalifa. Des membres du personnel qui avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu l'occasion de travailler avec Mme Khalifa par le pass\u00e9 avaient pr\u00e9venu M. Currie qu'ils avaient eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 surveiller ses heures de travail et son rendement, ajoutant que son assiduit\u00e9 et ses habitudes de travail \u00e9taient [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s fluctuantes. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait des [TRADUCTION] informations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales dont il disposait au sujet du rendement potentiel de Mme Khalifa.\n[40] M. Currie a reconnu que dans le pass\u00e9, quand Mme Khalifa lui avait fourni des services sur une base temporaire, il avait trouv\u00e9 son travail satisfaisant. Il a toutefois soulign\u00e9 que pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il avait exerc\u00e9 les fonctions de pr\u00e9sident-directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral par int\u00e9rim, il avait sous ses ordres une agente administrative \u00e0 temps plein charg\u00e9e de toutes les t\u00e2ches administratives. Ainsi, ses interactions avec le personnel auxiliaire, y compris Mme Khalifa, avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duites au minimum pendant la p\u00e9riode qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 le contrat de Mme Khalifa aupr\u00e8s de la division de la production, \u00e0 compter d'avril 2005.\n[41] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que M. Currie \u00e9tait trop occup\u00e9, en sa qualit\u00e9 de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la production, pour surveiller le travail de Mme Khalifa lui-m\u00eame et faire le compte de ses heures de travail, il en a charg\u00e9 Mme Murphy. Il a rencontr\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re le 11 avril 2005 et lui a demand\u00e9 de superviser les heures de travail de Mme Khalifa et de le tenir au courant du rendement de cette derni\u00e8re par rapport aux t\u00e2ches qui lui \u00e9taient confi\u00e9es. Il a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy qu'il avait certaines pr\u00e9occupations relativement \u00e0 l'horaire de Mme Khalifa ainsi qu'\u00e0 ses heures de travail. En vue de s'assurer que le travail serait effectu\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment aux termes du contrat, M. Currie a charg\u00e9 Mme Murphy de contr\u00f4ler les heures de Mme Khalifa pour s'assurer qu'elle faisait son travail et de lui pr\u00e9senter un rapport hebdomadaire au sujet du rendement de Mme Khalifa.\n(i) Quelles \u00e9taient les lacunes all\u00e9gu\u00e9es de Mme Khalifa en termes d'assiduit\u00e9 et de ponctualit\u00e9? [42] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir pris tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t dans sa carri\u00e8re l'habitude de toujours tenir un journal dans lequel elle consignait les t\u00e2ches effectu\u00e9es par le personnel plac\u00e9 sous ses ordres ainsi que les \u00e9v\u00e8nements li\u00e9s au travail, et ce, de mani\u00e8re quotidienne. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve des extraits de son journal r\u00e9dig\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle elle avait travaill\u00e9 avec Mme Khalifa en 2005. \u00c0 la suite de sa rencontre avec M. Currie le 11 avril, Mme Murphy a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 noter dans son journal les heures de pr\u00e9sence de Mme Khalifa ainsi que les heures auxquelles cette derni\u00e8re arrivait au travail et en partait chaque jour. Mme Murphy a soulign\u00e9 qu'en notant ces informations, son objectif principal n'\u00e9tait pas de v\u00e9rifier si Mme Khalifa arrivait \u00e0 une heure pr\u00e9cise le matin (8 h 45 ou 9 h par exemple), mais surtout de savoir si elle faisait les journ\u00e9es compl\u00e8tes de 7,5 heures qu'on s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'elle fasse (soit 37,5 heures par semaine).\n[43] Le 12 avril, soit le lendemain de sa rencontre avec M. Currie, Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 dans son journal que Mme Khalifa n'\u00e9tait pas venue au bureau de la journ\u00e9e et qu'elle n'avait pas non plus appel\u00e9 le matin pour justifier son absence. Plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, Mme Khalifa a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9venir qu'elle avait eu une crevaison et qu'elle ne viendrait pas au bureau. Le 18 avril, Mme Murphy a \u00e9crit dans son journal que Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 8 h 45, mais qu'elle \u00e9tait partie du bureau \u00e0 14 h, et qu'elle n'avait donc travaill\u00e9 que 5,25 heures. Le 19 avril, Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au travail \u00e0 14 h, expliquant qu'elle avait eu de nouveau des probl\u00e8mes de pneu sur sa voiture.\n[44] Mme Murphy se rappelait que le 25 avril, elle avait d\u00fb parler \u00e0 Mme Khalifa au sujet d'une incoh\u00e9rence dans ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence. D'apr\u00e8s les registres de Mme Murphy, Mme Khalifa n'avait travaill\u00e9 que 32,5 heures au cours de la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente (du 18 au 22 avril), mais Mme Khalifa avait rempli ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence comme si elle avait travaill\u00e9 une semaine compl\u00e8te de 37,5 heures. Apr\u00e8s que Mme Murphy lui eut parl\u00e9, Mme Khalifa a modifi\u00e9 le document pour qu'il fasse \u00e9tat du nombre exact d'heures de travail effectu\u00e9es.\n[45] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir port\u00e9 cet incident \u00e0 l'attention de M. Currie, qui lui a demand\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 assurer le suivi des heures de travail de Mme Khalifa, affirmant que si de tels probl\u00e8mes persistaient, il devrait s'en occuper.\n[46] Le 27 avril, Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 dans son journal que Mme Khalifa n'\u00e9tait pas dans son bureau et que cette derni\u00e8re ne l'avait pas pr\u00e9venue de son absence et ne lui avait pas non plus donn\u00e9 d'explications \u00e0 ce sujet. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas si Mme Khalifa avait fini par lui donner une explication, ou encore si cette absence avait dur\u00e9 toute la journ\u00e9e ou seulement une partie de celle-ci.\n[47] Le 28 avril, Mme Murphy a \u00e9crit dans son journal avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie de la [TRADUCTION] question de la supervision. Elle lui a dit que compte tenu des absences et arriv\u00e9es tardives \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de Mme Khalifa, elle se sentait mal \u00e0 l'aise de devoir la superviser. M. Currie lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il aborderait le probl\u00e8me avec Mme Khalifa directement. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas parl\u00e9 de la vie priv\u00e9e ou de la situation de famille de Mme Khalifa au cours de cette conversation.\n[48] \u00c0 la suite de sa conversation avec Mme Murphy, le jour suivant (le 29 avril), M. Currie a invit\u00e9 Mme Khalifa \u00e0 venir dans son bureau afin de discuter des probl\u00e8mes d'assiduit\u00e9 et d'horaire soulev\u00e9s par Mme Murphy. D'apr\u00e8s M. Currie, Mme Khalifa s'est plainte au cours de cette rencontre de la [TRADUCTION] supervision \u00e9troite dont elle faisait l'objet de la part de Mme Murphy. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne croyait pas que Mme Khalifa ait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 supervis\u00e9e d'aussi pr\u00e8s \u00e0 PGIC auparavant.\n[49] M. Currie a \u00e9galement confirm\u00e9 qu'au cours de cette rencontre, Mme Khalifa lui avait fait part de ses objections \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des commentaires que Mme Murphy aurait faits, selon lesquels Mme Khalifa devrait travailler ailleurs, \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 son emploi du temps serait plus souple et plus adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses besoins familiaux. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s la rencontre, il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy si elle avait dit quoi que ce soit donnant \u00e0 entendre (ou pouvant \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner \u00e0 entendre) que Mme Khalifa devrait travailler ailleurs, comme cette derni\u00e8re le lui avait dit. Mme Murphy lui a r\u00e9pondu que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[50] Lors du contre-interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy si lors de sa conversation avec M. Currie, elle avait abord\u00e9 la question de l'\u00e9tat de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire de Mme Khalifa et de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu'elle se trouve un emploi ailleurs du fait de sa situation de famille. Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 ne pas se rappeler avoir eu une telle conversation avec M. Currie. Elle se rappelait que M. Currie lui avait dit que Mme Khalifa avait exprim\u00e9 du ressentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la supervision \u00e9troite dont elle faisait l'objet de la part de Mme Murphy. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'au cours de cette rencontre avec Mme Murphy, celle-ci avait soulev\u00e9 un probl\u00e8me concernant un autre employ\u00e9 de PGIC, qui avait obtenu un emploi aupr\u00e8s d'un autre organisme gouvernemental. Cet ancien employ\u00e9 avait appel\u00e9 Mme Khalifa pour lui faire savoir qu'il se pouvait que son nouvel employeur ait un emploi pour elle. Mme Murphy a \u00e9galement \u00e9voqu\u00e9 cette discussion dans son t\u00e9moignage, m\u00eame si elle pensait qu'elle avait eu lieu en juin 2005. Elle se rappelait avoir dit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa que s'il s'agissait d'une occasion qu'elle souhaitait saisir, elle devrait y penser.\n[51] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s sa rencontre du 29 avril avec M. Currie, Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait revenue la voir dans son cubicule et lui avait dit d'une voix forte et avec col\u00e8re que si elle avait un probl\u00e8me avec elle, elle aurait d\u00fb lui en parler directement plut\u00f4t que d'aller voir M. Currie. Mme Murphy se rappelait que Mme Khalifa avait renvers\u00e9 avec fracas des objets qui se trouvaient sur son bureau. Dans son journal, pour cette journ\u00e9e, Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 : Discussion avec Bill au sujet de MK [Melissa Khalifa], MK a r\u00e9agi avec col\u00e8re.\n[52] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de la r\u00e9action de Mme Khalifa, elle s'\u00e9tait rendue dans le bureau de M. Currie afin de d\u00e9cider d'une mani\u00e8re de r\u00e9gler le probl\u00e8me. M. Currie lui a expliqu\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa avait exprim\u00e9 son ressentiment au sujet de la supervision \u00e9troite dont elle faisait l'objet de sa part en ce qui avait trait \u00e0 son horaire et \u00e0 son travail. Mme Khalifa \u00e9prouvait des [TRADUCTION] difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 organiser son horaire. Pour r\u00e9gler la question et lui offrir une certaine souplesse d'horaire, Mme Murphy a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie d'offrir \u00e0 Mme Khalifa la possibilit\u00e9 de travailler selon les termes d'une [TRADUCTION] entente d'horaire comprim\u00e9 avec PGIC. De telles ententes permettent aux employ\u00e9s de travailler une demi-heure de plus chaque jour, ce qui leur permet d'accumuler 13 jours de vacances suppl\u00e9mentaires chaque ann\u00e9e. Ainsi, pour chaque tranche de 19 jours de travail effectu\u00e9e, l'employ\u00e9 obtient un jour de cong\u00e9 (auquel s'ajoute un autre jour de cong\u00e9 par ann\u00e9e). La politique de PGIC voulait que de telles ententes soient seulement accessibles \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s \u00e0 dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou aux employ\u00e9s temporaires travaillant en vertu de contrats d'une dur\u00e9e minimale de six mois, et non aux employ\u00e9s temporaires comme Mme Khalifa. M. Currie a n\u00e9anmoins approuv\u00e9 la solution de Mme Murphy et a convenu d'offrir cette possibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0 (le 29 avril). Ils esp\u00e9raient que Mme Khalifa accueillerait favorablement la perspective de disposer de ces jours de cong\u00e9, ce qui lui permettrait peut-\u00eatre de s'acquitter de certaines de ses responsabilit\u00e9s familiales, comme emmener ses enfants \u00e0 leurs rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin ou prendre part \u00e0 leurs activit\u00e9s scolaires.\n[53] D'apr\u00e8s Mme Murphy, Mme Khalifa a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle \u00e9tait reconnaissante de la solution qui lui \u00e9tait offerte. L'entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9e et Mme Khalifa, Mme Murphy (en tant que superviseure) et M. Currie (en tant que directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la division) l'ont sign\u00e9e plus tard le m\u00eame jour. L'entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve. Elle pr\u00e9voyait que Mme Khalifa travaillerait huit heures par jour, qu'elle arriverait au bureau \u00e0 8 h 45 et qu'elle en partirait \u00e0 16 h 45. Ces informations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es par Mme Khalifa elle-m\u00eame, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir ins\u00e9r\u00e9 aucune clause concernant une heure de pause \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle quittait rarement le bureau \u00e0 midi. Elle avait pour habitude de manger tout en travaillant. Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 avoir pr\u00e9venu Mme Khalifa qu'elle pourrait quand m\u00eame prendre une demi-heure de pause \u00e0 midi si elle le souhaitait, \u00e0 la condition qu'elle rallonge sa journ\u00e9e de travail en cons\u00e9quence, c'est-\u00e0-dire qu'elle aurait des journ\u00e9es de travail de 8,5 heures incluant sa pause. PGIC a produit en preuve une copie de sa politique relative aux ententes d'horaire comprim\u00e9. Cette politique pr\u00e9voit que les heures d'arriv\u00e9e et de d\u00e9part des employ\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre conformes aux [TRADUCTION] heures d'activit\u00e9 de l'organisme, soit 8 h 30 \u00e0 11 h 30 et 13 h 30 \u00e0 15 h 30.\n[54] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en d\u00e9pit de la mise en uvre de l'entente d'horaire comprim\u00e9, Mme Khalifa avait continu\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre ponctuelle et assidue. Il continuait \u00e9galement d'y avoir des incoh\u00e9rences entre les heures que Mme Khalifa inscrivait sur ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence et les observations de Mme Murphy. Lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, Mme Murphy a fait la liste des dates auxquelles elle avait not\u00e9 dans son journal qu'il y avait eu des manquements :\nLe 4 mai - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h 30.\nLe 6 mai - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h, mais en est partie \u00e0 14 h 15. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas si Mme Khalifa lui avait donn\u00e9 une explication \u00e0 ce sujet ou si elle avait jamais rattrap\u00e9 ces heures. Dans sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa avait not\u00e9 \u00eatre partie du bureau \u00e0 16 h 55.\nLe 12 mai - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 10 h 45, apr\u00e8s avoir appel\u00e9 Mme Murphy pour la pr\u00e9venir qu'elle serait en retard. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa a not\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h ce jour-l\u00e0.\nLe 16 mai - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 10 h, apr\u00e8s avoir appel\u00e9 Mme Murphy pour la pr\u00e9venir qu'elle serait en retard. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa a not\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h ce jour-l\u00e0.\nLe 24 mai - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h 20 et est partie \u00e0 14 h 45. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas si elle l'avait pr\u00e9venue ou si elle lui avait donn\u00e9 une explication \u00e0 cette occasion. Elle ne se rappelait pas si Mme Khalifa avait r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 ses heures d'absence. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa a not\u00e9 \u00eatre partie du bureau \u00e0 17 h ce jour-l\u00e0.\nLe 31 mai - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 13 h 40. Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 dans son journal que Mme Khalifa avait d\u00fb se rendre chez le dentiste en urgence.\nLe 7 juin - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h 15 et en est partie \u00e0 15 h 30. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas que Mme Khalifa lui ait donn\u00e9 d'explication \u00e0 ce sujet ou qu'elle ait rattrap\u00e9 ses heures d'absence.\nLe 16 juin - Mme Khalifa a pris une pause de deux heures \u00e0 midi. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue \u00e0 l'avance. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa a not\u00e9 avoir pris une pause de 30 minutes.\nLe 21 juin - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h 10 et en est partie \u00e0 15 h. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue que Mme Khalifa partirait plus t\u00f4t.\nLe 28 juin - Mme Khalifa n'est pas arriv\u00e9e au bureau avant 13 h 30. Mme Khalifa n'a pas appel\u00e9 Mme Murphy pour la pr\u00e9venir qu'elle serait en retard et lui donner des explications \u00e0 ce sujet. Dans son journal, Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 avoir v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 avec la r\u00e9ception si Mme Khalifa avait appel\u00e9 et on lui a r\u00e9pondu que non. \u00c0 partir de cette date, Mme Murphy a chang\u00e9 de cubicule et elle n'occupait donc plus l'espace voisin de celui de Mme Khalifa. Toutefois, Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 qu'en vue de surveiller les heures d'arriv\u00e9e et de d\u00e9part de Mme Khalifa, elle se levait toutes les 10 minutes pour se rendre au bureau de Mme Khalifa pour v\u00e9rifier si elle \u00e9tait l\u00e0. Ainsi, les heures qu'elle a not\u00e9es dans son journal ne d\u00e9passaient jamais de 10 \u00e0 15 minutes l'heure d'arriv\u00e9e r\u00e9elle de Mme Khalifa.\nLe 29 juin - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 10 h. Elle n'a pas appel\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9venir qu'elle serait en retard. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa a not\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 9 h 30 ce jour-l\u00e0.\nLe 30 juin - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h 30.\nLe 4 juillet - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e au bureau \u00e0 9 h 30.\nLe 7 juillet - Mme Khalifa a appel\u00e9 Mme Murphy \u00e0 8 h 55 pour la pr\u00e9venir qu'elle serait en retard parce qu'elle avait un rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin. Elle lui a dit qu'elle arriverait \u00e0 10 h 30. \u00c0 12 h 20, alors que Mme Murphy \u00e9tait sur le point de sortir du bureau, elle a not\u00e9 dans son journal que Mme Khalifa n'\u00e9tait pas encore arriv\u00e9e et qu'elle n'avait pas appel\u00e9 pour expliquer son retard. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa a not\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 12 h 30, mais \u00eatre rest\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 19 h 30 ce soir-l\u00e0.\nLe 8 juillet - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 10 h. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, elle a not\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 9 h.\nLe 15 juillet - Mme Khalifa est arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 10 h 15.\nLe 27 juillet - Mme Khalifa s'est absent\u00e9e du bureau entre 11 h 45 et 14 h. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, elle a not\u00e9 n'avoir pris que 30 minutes pour manger.\nLe 29 juillet - Mme Khalifa s'est absent\u00e9e du bureau entre 11 h 45 et 13 h 15. Sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, elle a not\u00e9 n'avoir pris que 30 minutes pour manger.\n[55] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa des incoh\u00e9rences qu'il y avait entre le fruit de ses observations et les heures que cette derni\u00e8re avait entr\u00e9es sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence. Par exemple, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le 25 avril, une incoh\u00e9rence a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Khalifa, qui a modifi\u00e9 sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence en cons\u00e9quence. Le 6 juin, Mme Murphy a remarqu\u00e9 que sur sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence, Mme Khalifa avait not\u00e9 avoir travaill\u00e9 35 heures la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, alors que selon les observations de Mme Murphy, elle n'avait travaill\u00e9 que 28 heures. Mme Murphy a abord\u00e9 la question avec Mme Khalifa, qui lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait alors quelques difficult\u00e9s financi\u00e8res et qui lui a demand\u00e9 de signer la feuille de pr\u00e9sence faisant \u00e9tat d'un nombre d'heures de travail exag\u00e9r\u00e9 en consid\u00e9rant qu'il s'agissait d'une avance pour le travail qu'elle effectuerait plus tard. Mme Murphy a dit avoir accept\u00e9 la demande de Mme Khalifa et avoir sign\u00e9 le document [TRADUCTION] en toute bonne foi, afin de donner \u00e0 Mme Khalifa une certaine souplesse et lui permettre d'effectuer le travail quand elle le pourrait. Mme Murphy ne se rappelait pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e d'une quelconque mani\u00e8re que Mme Khalifa avait jamais r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 les heures dues.\n[56] Le 4 juillet, Mme Khalifa a soumis une feuille de pr\u00e9sence faisant \u00e9tat de 27,5 heures de travail \u00e0 Mme Murphy pour qu'elle la signe, mais les notes de Mme Murphy montraient que Mme Khalifa avait travaill\u00e9 25 heures cette m\u00eame semaine. Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa pr\u00e9tendait souvent effectuer une partie de son travail chez elle. Compte tenu de la diff\u00e9rence relativement faible de 2,5 heures, et du fait de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier les pr\u00e9tentions de Mme Khalifa, Mme Murphy a accept\u00e9 ses explications en toute bonne foi et n'a pas jug\u00e9 utile de lui parler de ce d\u00e9calage dans les heures.\n[57] Le 20 juillet, tandis qu'elle \u00e9valuait le rendement de Mme Khalifa, Mme Murphy a remarqu\u00e9 qu'une feuille de pr\u00e9sence soumise par Mme Khalifa relativement \u00e0 une semaine de travail ant\u00e9rieure faisait \u00e9tat de 37,5 heures de travail effectu\u00e9es. Or, il ressortait des notes de Mme Murphy que Mme Khalifa n'avait travaill\u00e9 que 30,5 heures cette semaine-l\u00e0. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Murphy \u00e9tait absente du bureau quand Mme Khalifa a soumis sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence pour approbation, un autre superviseur, qui n'\u00e9tait sans doute pas au courant du nombre d'heures exact effectu\u00e9 par Mme Khalifa, tel qu'il apparaissait dans les notes de Mme Murphy, l'avait sign\u00e9e.\n[58] Le 25 juillet, Mme Murphy a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 la feuille de pr\u00e9sence de Mme Khalifa pour la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente; \u00e0 en croire le document, elle avait effectu\u00e9 un total de 27,5 heures de travail. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas avoir jug\u00e9 utile de parler du d\u00e9calage \u00e0 Mme Khalifa \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours incapable de v\u00e9rifier si Mme Khalifa disait vrai quand elle affirmait travailler chez elle. En outre, Mme Murphy avait l'impression que compte tenu de tous les d\u00e9saccords qu'elle avait eus avec Mme Khalifa jusqu'alors, ce [TRADUCTION] n'\u00e9tait plus la peine de soulever la question.\n[59] Le 2 ao\u00fbt, qui s'est av\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre le dernier jour de Mme Khalifa \u00e0 PGIC, celle-ci a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy sa feuille de pr\u00e9sence pour la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 dans son journal que le nombre d'heures de travail que Mme Khalifa pr\u00e9tendait avoir effectu\u00e9 (25) exc\u00e9dait le nombre d'heures qu'elle avait elle-m\u00eame not\u00e9 (21). Vu que Mme Khalifa a quitt\u00e9 PGIC, elle ne lui a jamais parl\u00e9 de ce d\u00e9calage.\n[60] Sur bon nombre de feuilles de pr\u00e9sence, pour plusieurs jours, Mme Khalifa avait not\u00e9 \u00eatre arriv\u00e9e de 10 \u00e0 30 minutes plus t\u00f4t que les heures not\u00e9es par Mme Murphy dans son journal. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa que des d\u00e9calages les plus importants, plus particuli\u00e8rement ceux survenus pendant les premiers mois pendant lesquels Mme Khalifa avait travaill\u00e9 pour la division de la production. Dans presque tous les cas, Mme Murphy a quand m\u00eame sign\u00e9 les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence, sans qu'aucune correction n'y ait \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e, ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de [TRADUCTION] ne pas couper les cheveux en quatre, mais plut\u00f4t de donner [TRADUCTION] le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute \u00e0 Mme Khalifa, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les \u00e9carts n'\u00e9taient pas importants.\n(ii) Quels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 les indicateurs du rendement en d\u00e9clin de Mme Khalifa? [61] Les t\u00e2ches que Mme Khalifa a effectu\u00e9es entre avril et ao\u00fbt 2005 \u00e9taient divis\u00e9es en deux cat\u00e9gories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales (la coordination de projets \/ la production de rapports et les t\u00e2ches administratives), comme il en est fait \u00e9tat dans un document intitul\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] contrat qu'elle et Mme Murphy ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 de concert et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eat le 12 avril 2005. Les t\u00e2ches de coordination de projets et de production de rapports \u00e9taient attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Khalifa par la division de la production ainsi que par d'autres divisions. Ces t\u00e2ches devaient comprendre la production de rapports de PGIC, des activit\u00e9s de communication relative au site Internet de PGIC, la pr\u00e9paration de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s statistiques ainsi qu'une participation \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction d'un document intitul\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] Simplification des redevances et lignes directrices (les lignes directrices). Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e de t\u00e2ches administratives; elle devait notamment organiser les d\u00e9placements d'autres membres du personnel, planifier des r\u00e9unions, distribuer le courrier, fournir du soutien administratif \u00e0 Mme Murphy et remplacer la r\u00e9ceptionniste pendant ses pauses les mardis et les jeudis.\n[62] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 plusieurs reprises, Mme Khalifa ne s'\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9e de cette derni\u00e8re t\u00e2che. Le 9 juin, comme Mme Murphy l'a not\u00e9 dans son journal, Mme Khalifa n'est pas venue remplacer la r\u00e9ceptionniste comme pr\u00e9vu et personne n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de dire o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir d\u00fb remplacer la r\u00e9ceptionniste elle-m\u00eame. Au cours de son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Khalifa a laiss\u00e9 entendre que ce jour-l\u00e0, elle s'\u00e9tait arrang\u00e9e pour qu'un autre employ\u00e9 la remplace, mais Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue d'un tel arrangement et Mme Khalifa n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve appuyant ses affirmations. Mme Murphy a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le 26 juillet, Mme Khalifa avait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 9 h pour dire qu'elle ne viendrait pas au bureau parce qu'un de ses proches r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger \u00e9tait venu lui rendre visite de mani\u00e8re inattendue. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Murphy a d\u00fb remplacer Mme Khalifa \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception ce matin-l\u00e0.\n[63] Une des t\u00e2ches que M. Currie avait assign\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Khalifa pendant son contrat consistait \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer le plan de travail de la division de la production, c'est-\u00e0-dire un document d\u00e9finissant les activit\u00e9s de la division. Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 que ce projet faisait l'objet de [TRADUCTION] contraintes de temps, ce qui signifiait que certaines \u00e9ch\u00e9ances devaient \u00eatre respect\u00e9es. Conform\u00e9ment aux instructions de M. Currie, qui lui avait demand\u00e9 de surveiller la progression du travail de Mme Khalifa, Mme Murphy a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Khalifa le 26 mai afin de discuter de l'\u00e9tat d'avancement du projet. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Mme Murphy n'avait pas d'inqui\u00e9tudes concernant l'avancement du projet et Mme Khalifa n'a pas signal\u00e9 avoir quelque probl\u00e8me que ce soit relativement aux \u00e9ch\u00e9ances qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es ou avoir besoin de plus de temps pour terminer le projet. Toutefois, le 9 juin, M. Currie a convoqu\u00e9 Mmes Khalifa et Murphy \u00e0 une r\u00e9union portant sur le projet en question. M. Currie s'inqui\u00e9tait du fait que le projet concernant le plan de travail de la division avait pris du retard. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en entendant ces commentaires, Mme Khalifa avait adopt\u00e9 une attitude [TRADUCTION] plut\u00f4t d\u00e9fensive, mais qu'elle avait assur\u00e9 M. Currie que le plan de travail serait termin\u00e9 dans les temps. Je ne dispose d'aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve montrant si Mme Khalifa a finalement termin\u00e9 le plan de travail \u00e0 temps ou non.\n[64] Une autre des t\u00e2ches que M. Currie avait assign\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Khalifa pendant son contrat consistait \u00e0 coordonner la partie du compte rendu trimestriel de PGIC concernant la division de la production. Le compte rendu trimestriel est un document cl\u00e9 produit au sein de PGIC et transmis au PDG; il est la base sur laquelle sont mesur\u00e9s les progr\u00e8s de chaque division dans la poursuite de leurs objectifs respectifs. Ce document permet \u00e9galement \u00e0 chaque division d'informer les autres divisions de l'\u00e9tat d'avancement de leurs activit\u00e9s. Dans le cas qui nous int\u00e9resse, il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s important pour M. Currie que ce rapport soit pr\u00e9par\u00e9 correctement parce qu'il s'agissait du premier \u00e9change important entre sa division et le nouveau PDG. Le 22 juin, M. Currie et Mme Murphy ont rencontr\u00e9 Mme Khalifa pour d\u00e9finir la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9daction du rapport ainsi que le r\u00f4le que Mme Khalifa jouerait \u00e0 titre de coordonnatrice de la collecte des informations requises. Mme Khalifa devait travailler en collaboration avec d'autres employ\u00e9s de PGIC en vue de rassembler les informations n\u00e9cessaires. M. Currie a envoy\u00e9 des courriers \u00e9lectroniques \u00e0 tous les membres du personnel de la division qui devaient fournir les informations requises aux fins de la pr\u00e9paration du compte rendu trimestriel, en pr\u00e9cisant les dates auxquelles ils devraient avoir fait parvenir lesdites informations \u00e0 Mme Khalifa. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa n'avait pas termin\u00e9 le projet dans les d\u00e9lais qu'il lui avait fix\u00e9s.\n[65] Lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, Mme Murphy a confirm\u00e9 que lors de la r\u00e9union qui avait eu lieu le 22 juin, Mme Khalifa avait re\u00e7u l'ordre de compiler les renseignements et de r\u00e9diger une \u00e9bauche du compte rendu final avant la date d'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du projet. M. Currie a soulign\u00e9 qu'il voulait que le rapport de sa division soit entre les mains du PDG le 23 juillet au plus tard. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'un document faisant l'objet de [TRADUCTION] contraintes de temps, ce dont Mme Khalifa aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre consciente \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu l'occasion de pr\u00e9parer de tels documents dans le pass\u00e9. Le 5 juillet, Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 dans son journal avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa de l'\u00e9tat d'avancement du rapport. Mme Murphy a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa que le rapport devrait \u00eatre remis sous peu et elle lui a demand\u00e9 o\u00f9 elle en \u00e9tait dans sa pr\u00e9paration. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Murphy, Mme Khalifa n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de lui fournir de [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9tails. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Murphy a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 se demander si le rapport serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 temps.\n[66] Le 12 juillet, Mme Murphy a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Khalifa afin de revoir la mise en page du rapport. Le 18 juillet, Mme Khalifa a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour dire qu'elle prenait la journ\u00e9e en cong\u00e9 dans le cadre de son entente d'horaire comprim\u00e9, parce qu'elle avait de nouveau eu un pneu crev\u00e9. Elle s'est n\u00e9anmoins engag\u00e9e \u00e0 envoyer une \u00e9bauche du document par courrier \u00e9lectronique plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0. Ce courrier n'est jamais arriv\u00e9. Le jour suivant, le 19 juillet, Mme Murphy a de nouveau parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa pour lui rappeler qu'elle attendait toujours qu'elle lui fasse parvenir l'\u00e9bauche du rapport. Mme Khalifa lui a fourni l'\u00e9bauche plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0. Lors d'une rencontre qu'elle a eue plus tard dans la journ\u00e9e avec M. Currie, Mme Murphy a inform\u00e9 M. Currie, \u00e0 la demande de celui-ci, de la difficult\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa avait \u00e0 respecter ses \u00e9ch\u00e9ances ainsi que de ses probl\u00e8mes de ponctualit\u00e9 et d'assiduit\u00e9.\n[67] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'au cours du temps, Mme Khalifa avait adopt\u00e9 une attitude de plus en plus hostile lors des \u00e9changes relatifs \u00e0 la production du rapport, au point qu'il arrivait que Mme Khalifa refuse de r\u00e9pondre aux questions de Mme Murphy ou lui r\u00e9ponde tr\u00e8s s\u00e8chement. Le 19 juillet, Mme Murphy a mentionn\u00e9 cette attitude hostile dans son journal.\n[68] Le matin suivant (le 20 juillet), Mme Murphy a de nouveau parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie au sujet du manque d'engagement manifest\u00e9 par Mme Khalifa en vue de s'acquitter de ses obligations et de fournir le rapport ainsi que de l'hostilit\u00e9 croissante que cette derni\u00e8re manifestait \u00e0 son endroit. Mme Murphy a dit \u00e0 M. Currie que toute cette situation la pla\u00e7ait dans une position extr\u00eamement inconfortable. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tudierait le rapport produit par Mme Khalifa, mais que quoi qu'il en soit, compte tenu des difficult\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 respecter ses \u00e9ch\u00e9ances, il lui semblait n\u00e9cessaire de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une r\u00e9attribution des t\u00e2ches au sein de la division. Il a par cons\u00e9quent dit \u00e0 Mme Murphy qu'elle assumerait d\u00e9sormais les responsabilit\u00e9s de Mme Khalifa relatives \u00e0 la production du rapport trimestriel. M. Currie lui a dit qu'il expliquerait lui-m\u00eame ces changements \u00e0 Mme Khalifa. Mme Murphy a d\u00fb se d\u00e9p\u00eacher d'apporter un certain nombre de corrections n\u00e9cessaires au rapport, mais elle est parvenue \u00e0 fournir une \u00e9bauche \u00e0 M. Currie pour examen avant la fin de la journ\u00e9e.\n[69] Le 21 juillet, M. Currie a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Khalifa et l'a inform\u00e9e de la r\u00e9attribution des responsabilit\u00e9s au sein de la division. Mme Murphy \u00e9tait \u00e9galement pr\u00e9sente pendant la deuxi\u00e8me partie de cette rencontre. Elle et M. Currie ont tous deux d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 satisfaite des changements propos\u00e9s ainsi que du degr\u00e9 de supervision dont elle faisait l'objet de la part de Mme Murphy. Elle a insist\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de M. Currie pour qu'il [TRADUCTION] choisisse qui d'elle ou de Mme Murphy travaillerait pour lui \u00e0 la division de la production parce qu'elle se sentait incapable de travailler avec Mme Murphy. M. Currie lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas question de d\u00e9mettre Mme Murphy de ses fonctions. Elle \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e permanente \u00e0 plein temps de PGIC alors que Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e temporaire contractuelle.\n[70] Mme Khalifa a fait savoir qu'elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] malheureuse de la situation; M. Currie lui a alors demand\u00e9 ce qu'il lui fallait pour \u00eatre [TRADUCTION] heureuse. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il lui a demand\u00e9 si elle avait des suggestions susceptibles d'arranger la situation avec Mme Murphy. M. Currie a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9rob\u00e9e et qu'elle n'avait ni demand\u00e9 ni propos\u00e9 que soient mise en uvre des solutions qui lui permettraient de s'acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches conform\u00e9ment aux attentes et dans les d\u00e9lais requis.\n[71] M. Currie a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa et \u00e0 Mme Murphy de trouver des solutions pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me. Mme Murphy se rappelait avoir dit, \u00e0 l'occasion de cette rencontre, qu'elle \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 s'attaquer \u00e0 tous les probl\u00e8mes qui se posaient, mais qu'elle restait n\u00e9anmoins d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux attentes que M. Currie, ce qui consistait notamment \u00e0 fournir du travail \u00e0 Mme Khalifa.\n[72] Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait visiblement boulevers\u00e9e par la situation. M. Currie se rappelle lui avoir sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que vu son insatisfaction, elle serait peut-\u00eatre plus heureuse ailleurs.\n[73] M. Currie a affirm\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 l'occasion de cette rencontre, il avait inform\u00e9 Mme Khalifa qu'il penserait \u00e0 des mani\u00e8res de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me pendant ses vacances. Il lui a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 de s'acquitter de ses t\u00e2ches et de respecter ses \u00e9ch\u00e9ances pendant son absence.\n[74] Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que jusqu'\u00e0 cette rencontre du 21 juillet, sa relation de travail avec Mme Khalifa connaissait [TRADUCTION] des hauts et des bas. Elle avait parfois l'impression que Mme Khalifa avait \u00e0 cur d'accomplir son travail et de s'acquitter des t\u00e2ches qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es, mais \u00e0 d'autres moments, elle trouvait que Mme Khalifa semblait faire peu de cas de ses obligations en tant qu'employ\u00e9e contractuelle de PGIC. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9crit ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 superviser les heures de travail de Mme Khalifa et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des solutions pour r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me comme la pla\u00e7ant dans une situation [TRADUCTION] extr\u00eamement inconfortable, ce qu'elle a dit \u00e0 M. Currie. Mme Murphy a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que jusqu'alors, lors de ses discussions avec M. Currie, il n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question de l'annulation du contrat de Mme Khalifa.\n[75] Dans le courant du mois de juillet, avant son d\u00e9part en vacances le 22 juillet, M. Currie a attribu\u00e9 une autre t\u00e2che \u00e0 Mme Khalifa : la pr\u00e9paration des lignes directrices (dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 question ci-dessus), qui contiennent des informations relatives au calcul des redevances que l'industrie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re et gazi\u00e8re doit payer. Il est important pour l'industrie que les lignes directrices soient publi\u00e9es en temps opportun. M. Currie avait fourni \u00e0 Mme Khalifa une \u00e9bauche de document comptant 80 pages, sur laquelle il avait apport\u00e9 un certain nombre de changements. Il a charg\u00e9 Mme Khalifa de pr\u00e9parer les lignes directrices, y compris de les faire traduire en fran\u00e7ais, avant son retour de vacances le 2 ao\u00fbt. Il s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'il faille plus d'une semaine \u00e0 Mme Khalifa pour effectuer le travail. Lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, Mme Murphy a soulign\u00e9 qu'au 25 juillet, Mme Khalifa n'avait fait \u00e9tat d'aucun progr\u00e8s relativement \u00e0 ce travail. Ainsi, le 2 ao\u00fbt, quand M. Currie est rentr\u00e9 de vacances, Mme Khalifa n'avait toujours pas pris les dispositions n\u00e9cessaires pour que le document soit traduit et le document final n'\u00e9tait toujours pas pr\u00eat.\n(iii) Comment Mme Khalifa a-t-elle d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une relation tendue avec Mme Murphy et comment lui a-t-elle manqu\u00e9 de respect? [76] PGIC a pr\u00e9tendu qu'il ne faisait aucun doute que la relation de Mme Khalifa et Mme Murphy \u00e9tait devenue de plus en plus tendue au fil du temps. Par exemple, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le 29 avril, Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait venue la voir \u00e0 son bureau apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec M. Currie et qu'elle avait, dans un mouvement de col\u00e8re, renvers\u00e9 plusieurs objets qui se trouvaient sur son bureau, tout en se plaignant d'une voix forte que Mme Murphy aurait d\u00fb lui parler directement de son probl\u00e8me de ponctualit\u00e9 plut\u00f4t qu'aller voir M. Currie.\n[77] Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 que les choses ne s'\u00e9taient pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9es au fil des semaines suivantes. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mme Murphy a parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie \u00e0 plusieurs reprises des difficult\u00e9s qu'elle \u00e9prouvait \u00e0 superviser l'assiduit\u00e9 et le travail de Mme Khalifa. Cette tension a connu son point culminant le 20 juillet, ce qui s'est traduit par l'interruption totale des communications entre elle et Mme Khalifa, quand Mme Murphy a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa si elle avait progress\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9paration du rapport trimestriel. Mme Khalifa s'est alors montr\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] hostile et [TRADUCTION] ferm\u00e9e \u00e0 toute conversation. Mme Khalifa a refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux questions de Mme Murphy, qui lui a rappel\u00e9 que le document aurait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00eat. M. Currie souhaitait le r\u00e9viser avant son d\u00e9part en vacances deux jours plus tard. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa avait fait preuve d'une attitude [TRADUCTION] bourrue en refusant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses questions.\n[78] Deux jours plus tard, le 22 juillet, Mme Murphy a \u00e9crit dans son journal que Mme Khalifa s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] extr\u00eamement impolie \u00e0 son endroit. Quand elle a dit [TRADUCTION] Bonjour \u00e0 Mme Khalifa, cette derni\u00e8re n'a rien r\u00e9pondu. Mme Murphy a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que pendant la majeure partie de la journ\u00e9e, elle avait pu entendre Mme Khalifa parler au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et se plaindre du fait que Mme Murphy l'avait d\u00e9poss\u00e9d\u00e9e de toutes ses responsabilit\u00e9s professionnelles. Mme Murphy se rappelait \u00e9galement avoir vu Mme Khalifa parler \u00e0 deux autres employ\u00e9s de PGIC ailleurs dans le bureau ce jour-l\u00e0. Elle a entendu environ 30 secondes de leur conversation, au cours de laquelle Mme Khalifa a bl\u00e2m\u00e9 Mme Murphy de tous les changements apport\u00e9s \u00e0 ses responsabilit\u00e9s. Plus tard dans la journ\u00e9e, un des deux employ\u00e9s en question est venu voir Mme Murphy et lui a carr\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 quel [TRADUCTION] \u00e9tait son r\u00f4le dans les changements qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s aux t\u00e2ches de Mme Khalifa. \u00c0 partir de ce jour, ces deux employ\u00e9s ont adopt\u00e9 une attitude [TRADUCTION] glaciale \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Murphy.\n[79] Le jour ouvrable suivant, le lundi 25 juillet, Mme Murphy a not\u00e9 dans son journal que Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait de meilleure humeur. Elle avait emmen\u00e9 ses enfants au bureau et les avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Murphy. Autour de 11 h 30, sa famille et elle avaient quitt\u00e9 le bureau et Mme Khalifa n'est pas revenue du reste de la journ\u00e9e parce qu'un des enfants avait rendez-vous chez le m\u00e9decin. Le jour suivant (le 26 juillet) \u00e9tait le jour o\u00f9 un proche de Mme Khalifa r\u00e9sidant \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger \u00e9tait venu lui rendre visite. Mme Khalifa est venue lui faire visiter le bureau pendant une vingtaine de minutes et ils sont ensuite partis pour le reste de la journ\u00e9e.\n[80] Pendant les trois jours ouvrables suivants (du 27 au 29 juillet), qui ont pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 la rencontre finale de Mme Khalifa et de M. Currie le 2 ao\u00fbt, Mme Murphy n'a inscrit aucune note dans son journal concernant l'attitude de Mme Khalifa \u00e0 son endroit, pas plus qu'elle n'a fait de remarques \u00e0 ce sujet lors de son t\u00e9moignage.\n(iv) Quelle est l'explication donn\u00e9e par PGIC relativement \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de travail de Mme Khalifa? [81] Le 2 ao\u00fbt, \u00e0 son retour de vacances, M. Currie a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy s'il y avait eu des changements concernant les probl\u00e8mes relatifs au travail de Mme Khalifa. Mme Murphy l'a inform\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa n'avait toujours pas honor\u00e9 ses engagements \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la division de la production (la traduction des lignes directrices n'avait toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e), qu'elle n'effectuait toujours pas les heures de travail attendues d'elle et que son attitude \u00e0 l'endroit de Mme Murphy avait empir\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la rencontre de Mme Khalifa et de M. Currie le 21 juillet.\n[82] M. Currie a conclu que les probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 Mme Khalifa sur les plans du respect des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances, de l'assiduit\u00e9 et de sa relation avec Mme Murphy ne pourraient pas \u00eatre r\u00e9solus pendant les deux semaines de travail que Mme Khalifa devait encore effectuer par contrat, lequel contrat prenait fin le 19 ao\u00fbt. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir alors d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus intervenir de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 obtenir la prolongation dudit contrat. Il savait que la division de la production avait les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour que les t\u00e2ches de Mme Khalifa soient imm\u00e9diatement attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s et il a donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus lui attribuer de t\u00e2ches jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de son contrat.\n[83] Avant d'aller de l'avant, M. Currie a rencontr\u00e9 le directeur de la division des contrats et de l'administration de PGIC, M. Potter, ainsi que Mme Murphy. M. Potter lui a expliqu\u00e9 que PGIC pouvait mettre fin au contrat d'un employ\u00e9 temporaire tel que Mme Khalifa en tout temps avant la fin d'un contrat, si cela s'av\u00e9rait n\u00e9cessaire. M. Potter a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir compris que l'intention de M. Currie \u00e9tait de mettre fin au contrat de Mme Khalifa le jour m\u00eame. M. Potter a par cons\u00e9quent offert de parler \u00e0 Mme Khalifa de la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat, ou d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de M. Currie si ce dernier voulait lui annoncer la nouvelle lui-m\u00eame. M. Currie a d\u00e9clin\u00e9 ces deux propositions.\n[84] Apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec M. Potter, M. Currie est all\u00e9 trouver Mme Khalifa et l'a invit\u00e9e \u00e0 le rejoindre dans la petite salle de conf\u00e9rence. Il lui a expliqu\u00e9 qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que ses probl\u00e8mes de respect des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances, d'assiduit\u00e9, de performance et de comportement ne pouvaient \u00eatre r\u00e9solus, il avait conclu qu'il \u00e9tait peu probable que la division de la production fasse de nouveau appel \u00e0 ses services \u00e0 la fin de son contrat. Il lui a \u00e9galement dit qu'il ne lui assignerait plus aucune t\u00e2che d'ici la fin dudit contrat et qu'au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, il voulait travailler avec elle \u00e0 mettre au point une [TRADUCTION] strat\u00e9gie de transition en vue de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 d'autres employ\u00e9s les dossiers sur lesquels elle travaillait, et de lui permettre de restituer tout document de PGIC qui serait en sa possession. Dans le cadre de cette strat\u00e9gie, il avait aussi l'intention d'aider Mme Khalifa \u00e0 \u00e9tudier la possibilit\u00e9 qu'une autre division retienne ses services dans le cadre d'un nouveau contrat. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette fin, plus tard ce jour-l\u00e0, il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs directeurs de PGIC pour lesquels Mme Khalifa avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 pour leur dire qu'il ne renouvellerait pas son contrat, mais qu'ils pouvaient faire appel aux services de celle ci en puisant dans leurs propres budgets les fonds n\u00e9cessaires.\n[85] Au fur et \u00e0 mesure que sa rencontre avec Mme Khalifa avan\u00e7ait, M. Currie avait l'impression que cette derni\u00e8re paraissait [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9pass\u00e9e et qu'elle n'\u00e9tait plus [TRADUCTION] capable de traiter les informations qu'il lui communiquait. Elle paraissait [TRADUCTION] monologuer. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 ce stade, il lui avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de finir sa journ\u00e9e de travail ou de rentrer chez elle imm\u00e9diatement, \u00e0 sa convenance, ajoutant qu'elle serait pay\u00e9e pour la totalit\u00e9 de la journ\u00e9e. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu'il s'attendait pleinement \u00e0 ce que Mme Khalifa revienne travailler le jour suivant et mette en uvre la strat\u00e9gie de transition pendant les derniers jours de son contrat. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le jour suivant, quand il avait constat\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa n'\u00e9tait pas revenue au bureau, il avait appel\u00e9 chez elle et lui avait laiss\u00e9 un message. Mme Khalifa ne l'a jamais rappel\u00e9.\n[86] Les t\u00e9moignages de M. Potter et de Mme Murphy semblent diverger quelque peu de celui de M. Currie en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la date de r\u00e9siliation du contrat. D'apr\u00e8s M. Potter, lors de sa rencontre avec M. Currie le 2 ao\u00fbt au matin, il a compris que M. Currie avait l'intention de [TRADUCTION] mettre fin au contrat de Mme Khalifa le jour m\u00eame. Pour sa part, Mme Murphy se rappelait que M. Currie \u00e9tait venu la voir \u00e0 son bureau apr\u00e8s la rencontre pour lui dire qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de r\u00e9soudre les probl\u00e8mes relatifs \u00e0 Mme Khalifa et que bien qu'il ait l'intention de mettre fin \u00e0 son contrat le jour m\u00eame, il lui avait donn\u00e9 l'option de rester travailler le reste de la journ\u00e9e. Comme Mme Murphy l'a not\u00e9 dans son journal, Mme Khalifa a choisi de ne pas rester, mais plut\u00f4t de rentrer chez elle \u00e0 11 h 30.\n[87] M. Currie a ni\u00e9 \u00eatre rest\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du cubicule de Mme Khalifa, \u00e0 attendre qu'elle parte, contrairement \u00e0 ce que cette derni\u00e8re a d\u00e9clar\u00e9. Il a admis \u00eatre pass\u00e9 devant son cubicule un certain nombre de fois, mais seulement pour aller rencontrer diff\u00e9rents directeurs dans leurs bureaux respectifs au sujet de la disponibilit\u00e9 de Mme Khalifa, comme il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 question ci dessus.\n(v) M. Currie et Mme Murphy ont-ils abord\u00e9 avec Mme Khalifa le sujet de sa situation de famille et cela a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment ayant motiv\u00e9 leur conduite ainsi que les d\u00e9cisions qu'ils ont prises \u00e0 son \u00e9gard? [88] Mme Murphy a maintenu que la situation de famille de Mme Khalifa n'avait en aucune mani\u00e8re \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment dans les \u00e9changes d'ordre professionnel qu'elle avait eus avec Mme Khalifa \u00e0 PGIC. Mme Murphy a bien reconnu que Mme Khalifa et elle avaient eu de temps en temps des conversations d'ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au sujet de leurs vies personnelles respectives, comme il est souvent d'usage entre coll\u00e8gues. Elles se demandaient comment leurs week-ends s'\u00e9taient pass\u00e9s ou comment allaient leurs enfants. Mme Murphy a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa ne lui avait jamais dit qu'elle ne voulait pas parler de sa famille ou qu'elle se sentait mal \u00e0 l'aise de discuter de sa vie personnelle.\n[89] Mme Murphy a ni\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement avoir dit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa que les m\u00e8res c\u00e9libataires comme elle devraient chercher un emploi ailleurs, contrairement \u00e0 ce Mme Khalifa a pr\u00e9tendu. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, Mme Murphy se rappelait bien que Mme Khalifa lui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle envisageait d'accepter un emploi \u00e0 temps plein aupr\u00e8s d'un autre organisme gouvernemental o\u00f9 un ancien employ\u00e9 de PGIC travaillait. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir alors dit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa que s'il s'agissait d'un emploi qu'elle aimerait occuper, elle devrait examiner cette possibilit\u00e9. La vie priv\u00e9e et la situation de famille de Mme Khalifa n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es au cours de cette discussion.\n[90] M. Currie a affirm\u00e9 que quand il avait rencontr\u00e9 Mme Khalifa le 29 avril, elle s'\u00e9tait plainte du fait que Mme Murphy avait formul\u00e9 des commentaires sous-entendant qu'elle devrait chercher un emploi ailleurs, \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 l'horaire de travail serait plus souple et lui permettrait de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations familiales. M. Currie a ensuite soulev\u00e9 la question avec Mme Murphy en lui demandant si elle avait dit quoi que ce soit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa donnant \u00e0 entendre (ou qui pouvait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 donner \u00e0 entendre) qu'elle devrait travailler ailleurs. Mme Murphy a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne se rappelait pas avoir formul\u00e9 un tel commentaire, ce qu'elle maintient toujours aujourd'hui. En ce qui a trait aux questions de M. Currie, Mme Murphy se rappelait seulement qu'il lui avait dit que Mme Khalifa \u00e9prouvait du ressentiment \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la supervision \u00e9troite dont elle faisait l'objet de la part de Mme Murphy et que Mme Khalifa avait fait savoir que les difficult\u00e9s relatives \u00e0 son travail \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 ses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 g\u00e9rer son temps. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Murphy, c'est en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9occupation qu'elle a propos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Currie d'offrir une entente d'horaire comprim\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa.\n[91] Pour sa part, M. Currie a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la situation de famille de Mme Khalifa n'avait jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans les \u00e9changes qu'il avait eus avec elle ou dans sa d\u00e9cision finale de mettre fin \u00e0 son emploi aupr\u00e8s de la division de la production. Il a ni\u00e9 avoir jamais dit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'elle a pr\u00e9tendu, qu'elle devrait chercher un emploi ailleurs, un emploi qui conviendrait mieux \u00e0 sa [TRADUCTION] situation familiale. Il admet qu'un matin, il a vu Mme Khalifa arriver au travail en retard, stress\u00e9e et troubl\u00e9e. Il l'a invit\u00e9e dans son bureau pour une discussion en priv\u00e9. Il lui a demand\u00e9 si elle et sa famille allaient bien et si elle avait besoin d'aide. Elle lui a r\u00e9pondu que tout allait bien, mais elle lui a \u00e9galement dit que ses questions la mettaient mal \u00e0 l'aise. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il lui avait imm\u00e9diatement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses excuses et qu'il lui avait expliqu\u00e9 qu'il ne lui avait pos\u00e9 ces questions que parce qu'il s'inqui\u00e9tait pour elle. Il lui a \u00e9galement dit qu'il \u00e9prouvait de l'empathie \u00e0 son endroit parce que sa propre fille \u00e9tait aussi une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire.\n(vi) L'explication de PGIC est-elle raisonnable ou s'agit-il d'un pr\u00e9texte pour se livrer \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires? [92] Je conclus que PGIC a fourni une explication raisonnable en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie par Mme Khalifa.\n[93] La preuve m'a convaincu que Mme Khalifa \u00e9prouvait de s\u00e9rieuses difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre ponctuelle. Le journal de Mme Murphy \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement convaincant sur ce point. Ce journal \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s d\u00e9taill\u00e9 et Mme Murphy s'est montr\u00e9e tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible quand elle a racont\u00e9 le soin qu'elle prenait \u00e0 y consigner toutes ses activit\u00e9s quotidiennes. Je suis convaincu que toutes les informations qu'elle a not\u00e9es dans son journal constituaient le r\u00e9cit des \u00e9v\u00e8nements tels qu'elle les avait observ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Elle m'a paru \u00eatre une employ\u00e9e consciencieuse qui prenait son travail au s\u00e9rieux, et le fait qu'elle ait tenu un journal de ses activit\u00e9s quotidiennes confirme totalement mon impression.\n[94] Un autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment que j'ai pris en consid\u00e9ration lorsque j'ai examin\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Murphy est le fait qu'elle a cess\u00e9 de travailler pour PGIC en 2005, seulement quelques mois apr\u00e8s que l'emploi de Mme Khalifa eut pris fin. En 2004, Mme Murphy avait quitt\u00e9 le Nouveau Brunswick et \u00e9tait all\u00e9e s'installer \u00e0 Calgary pour accompagner son mari qui y avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9. Le couple est retourn\u00e9 vivre au Nouveau Brunswick en octobre 2005. Ainsi, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Mme Murphy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, elle n'avait plus eu de lien avec PGIC depuis pr\u00e8s de quatre ans et aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 donnant \u00e0 entendre qu'elle ait eu quelque int\u00e9r\u00eat que ce soit dans l'issue du pr\u00e9sent litige. \u00c0 mes yeux, tout cela rend son t\u00e9moignage d'autant plus cr\u00e9dible.\n[95] Mme Khalifa a soulign\u00e9 les heures d'arriv\u00e9e et de d\u00e9part dont il \u00e9tait fait \u00e9tat sur ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence, qui avaient toutes \u00e9t\u00e9 sign\u00e9es soit par Mme Murphy soit par d'autres directeurs de PGIC. Beaucoup de ces heures diff\u00e8rent des heures consign\u00e9es par Mme Murphy dans son journal. Il convient toutefois de souligner que c'est Mme Khalifa qui remplissait toujours ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence et non les directeurs. En outre, il est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que Mme Murphy ne signe pas les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence, lorsque les \u00e9carts \u00e9taient trop importants. Lorsque c'est arriv\u00e9, Mme Khalifa a reconnu ses erreurs et a soit modifi\u00e9 les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence en cons\u00e9quence, soit a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy de passer outre l'erreur en lui promettant qu'elle rattraperait le temps perdu. J'accepte l'explication de Mme Murphy en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9carts les moins importants; elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de donner \u00e0 Mme Khalifa [TRADUCTION] le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute ou alors, consid\u00e9rant que leur relation devenait tendue, elle a simplement \u00e9vit\u00e9 de s'engager dans un conflit \u00e0 ce sujet. Lors du contre-interrogatoire de Mme Murphy, Mme Khalifa a paru sous entendre qu'en certaines occasions, quand elle s'absentait de son bureau \u00e0 midi, c'\u00e9tait dans le but d'aller rencontrer des directeurs d'autres divisions au sujet du travail qu'elle effectuait pour leur compte. Mme Khalifa n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve appuyant cette all\u00e9gation, m\u00eame si cela \u00e9tait vrai, cela n'expliquerait en rien ses autres manquements en termes de ponctualit\u00e9 et d'assiduit\u00e9. Dans l'ensemble, si ce n'est qu'elle a renvoy\u00e9 aux feuilles de pr\u00e9sence en tant que telles, Mme Khalifa n'a jamais affirm\u00e9 qu'elle se trouvait bien au bureau pendant les heures apparaissant sur les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence.\n[96] PGIC a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli que le travail de Mme Khalifa posait des probl\u00e8mes importants, ayant d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa n'avait pas respect\u00e9 ses \u00e9ch\u00e9ances \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, y compris en ce qui concernait la production du rapport trimestriel et des lignes directrices. PGIC a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli que M. Currie en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 constater qu'une relation tendue s'\u00e9tait instaur\u00e9e entre un membre de son personnel permanent (Mme Murphy) et Mme Khalifa.\n[97] Lors du contre-interrogatoire de M. Currie, Mme Khalifa a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 entendre que le rapport trimestriel avait \u00e9t\u00e9 finalement termin\u00e9 et envoy\u00e9 au PDG, et que PGIC avait accord\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e0 toutes les divisions pour la remise du rapport, sous-entendant ainsi que son rendement n'avait pas vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 remis en question en ce qui a trait au rapport. Toutefois, il n'en demeure pas moins que M. Currie lui avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 explicitement qu'\u00e0 titre de directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la production et de personne qui lui assignait cette t\u00e2che, il s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'elle termine le rapport et le lui remette avant le 23 juillet. Il s'\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 envers le PDG \u00e0 remettre le rapport \u00e0 cette date (c'est-\u00e0-dire avant de partir en vacances le jour suivant). Le fait que Mme Khalifa ait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 s'acquitter de cette t\u00e2che (elle n'a envoy\u00e9 les \u00e9bauches de rapport \u00e0 Mme Murphy que quelques jours avant la date d'\u00e9ch\u00e9ance) avait mis l'engagement de M. Currie en p\u00e9ril. Je ne consid\u00e8re pas que de telles circonstances soient un pr\u00e9texte donn\u00e9 par PGIC en guise d'explication.\n[98] Mme Khalifa a attir\u00e9 l'attention du Tribunal sur le t\u00e9moignage d'autres employ\u00e9s de PGIC ainsi que sur celui de Mme Larocque, selon lesquels ils n'\u00e9taient pas au courant de probl\u00e8mes affectant son travail. Je suis d'avis que ces t\u00e9moignages ne remettent pas en question le caract\u00e8re raisonnable des explications de PGIC dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. M. Jaques a supervis\u00e9 Mme Khalifa de mani\u00e8re limit\u00e9e et il se rappelait seulement qu'elle s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] serviable. Une employ\u00e9e de PGIC, Alexandra Steinke, avec laquelle il \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa de travailler au sein de la division de la haute direction, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir observ\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa faisait du [TRADUCTION] vraiment bon travail et qu'elle avait pu s'acquitter de toutes les t\u00e2ches qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es. Toutefois, elle a admis n'avoir jamais observ\u00e9 le travail accompli par Mme Khalifa au sein de la division de la production, pas plus qu'elle n'a contr\u00f4l\u00e9 ou v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 aucune de ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence \u00e0 PGIC. Elle travaillait dans un bureau \u00e9loign\u00e9 de celui de Mme Khalifa et elle ne pouvait pas voir si celle-ci venait au travail tous les jours.\n[99] M. Potter a supervis\u00e9 Mme Khalifa du temps o\u00f9 elle travaillait \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception, quand elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour PGIC. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait fourni un excellent service dans ce poste, mais qu'il n'avait plus eu l'occasion de superviser son travail par la suite. De m\u00eame, Mme McCurdie a affirm\u00e9 que sa division \u00e9tait responsable des activit\u00e9s de la r\u00e9ception. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 n'avoir jamais eu de probl\u00e8me avec Mme Khalifa du temps o\u00f9 celle-ci travaillait \u00e0 la r\u00e9ception, que ce soit sur le plan du travail, de l'assiduit\u00e9 ou de la ponctualit\u00e9. Mme Larocque a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait maintenant une des meilleures employ\u00e9es de Spirit et une des plus d\u00e9vou\u00e9es. Elle n'avait aucun probl\u00e8me avec elle sur les plans de l'assiduit\u00e9 ou de la ponctualit\u00e9. Mme Larocque a \u00e9galement soulign\u00e9 le fait que PGIC avait renouvel\u00e9 le contrat de Mme Khalifa \u00e0 maintes reprises, ce qui \u00e9tait un bon indicateur du fait que son travail donnait toute satisfaction.\n[100] Ce t\u00e9moignage ne remet toutefois pas en cause le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l'explication donn\u00e9e par PGIC en ce qui concerne la qualit\u00e9 du travail de Mme Khalifa. Certains t\u00e9moignages font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une \u00e9poque ant\u00e9rieure, celle o\u00f9 Mme Khalifa a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour PGIC, ou alors \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode beaucoup plus r\u00e9cente, dans un environnement de travail diff\u00e9rent. Aucun de ces t\u00e9moignages n'a trait \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e par la division de la production. Mieux encore, la preuve relative \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 du travail accompli par Mme Khalifa pour le compte de la division de la production n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 remise en question et \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rente avec les feuilles de pr\u00e9sence (que Mme Khalifa a accept\u00e9 de modifier plusieurs fois, quand Mme Murphy a port\u00e9 les \u00e9carts \u00e0 son attention). \u00c0 l'audience, plut\u00f4t que de nier avoir effectu\u00e9 les t\u00e2ches qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9es en retard, Mme Khalifa a affirm\u00e9 qu'il importait peu que ses rapports aient \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en retard \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que PGIC avait finalement accord\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai \u00e0 toutes les divisions pour la production du rapport trimestriel.\n[101] Mme Khalifa a \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'il existait une contradiction entre les souvenirs de M. Currie et ceux de Mme Murphy au sujet des questions que M. Currie avait pos\u00e9es \u00e0 celle-ci au cours de leur conversation du 28 avril, relativement \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Khalifa de travailler tout en \u00e9tant une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Murphy si elle avait dit quoi que ce soit qui pouvait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 comme un commentaire signifiant que Mme Khalifa devrait travailler ailleurs, dans un endroit o\u00f9 l'horaire lui permettrait de mieux s'acquitter de ses obligations familiales. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient jamais abord\u00e9 la question de la [TRADUCTION] situation familiale de Mme Khalifa en tant que m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. M. Currie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne consid\u00e9rait pas que la question qu'il avait pos\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Murphy constituait une discussion au sujet de la [TRADUCTION] situation familiale de Mme Khalifa et PGIC a de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re fait valoir qu'il n'y avait aucune contradiction entre les souvenirs de Mme Murphy et ceux de M. Currie. Quoi qu'il en soit, m\u00eame s'il y a une diff\u00e9rence entre les d\u00e9clarations des deux t\u00e9moins, je ne suis pas convaincu que ces diff\u00e9rences soient suffisamment significatives pour remettre en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de leurs t\u00e9moignages dans leur ensemble ou pour remettre en question le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de l'explication de PGIC.\n[102] Mme Khalifa a soutenu que si son travail soulevait vraiment des probl\u00e8mes sur les plans de la qualit\u00e9 et de la rapidit\u00e9 d'ex\u00e9cution, elle aurait d\u00fb en \u00eatre avis\u00e9e. Toutefois, j'accepte la r\u00e9ponse de PGIC selon laquelle Mme Khalifa en a effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e, ne serait-ce qu'\u00e0 l'occasion des nombreuses discussions qu'elle a eues avec Mme Murphy au sujet des d\u00e9calages dans ses feuilles de pr\u00e9sence ainsi qu'au sujet du retard avec lequel elle a produit le rapport, un sujet que M. Currie a \u00e9galement abord\u00e9 avec elle, et l'attitude des deux superviseurs \u00e0 son \u00e9gard est totalement coh\u00e9rente avec la d\u00e9cision finale de M. Currie de ne pas renouveler le contrat de Mme Khalifa.\n[103] Mme Khalifa a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9tendu qu'il y avait une diff\u00e9rence entre le t\u00e9moignage de M. Currie, qui a dit qu'il n'avait pas l'intention de renouveler son contrat lorsqu'il parviendrait \u00e0 son terme, et les d\u00e9clarations de M. Potter et de Mme Murphy, qui ont compris que M. Currie avait l'intention de mettre fin au contrat de Mme Khalifa imm\u00e9diatement. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu'en ce qui concerne la question de la situation familiale de Mme Khalifa \u00e9voqu\u00e9e ci-dessus, je ne vois pas d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 soulever une telle diff\u00e9rence, si diff\u00e9rence il y a. Le fait est que M. Currie ne souhaitait plus continuer d'employer Mme Khalifa. Tous les t\u00e9moins en conviennent. Toute confusion au sujet de sa volont\u00e9 de mettre imm\u00e9diatement fin \u00e0 l'emploi ou d'aider Mme Khalifa \u00e0 effectuer une transition pendant la dur\u00e9e restante de son contrat n'est pas pertinente. Cela ne remet pas en cause la preuve dans son ensemble.\n[104] Les r\u00e9cits de Mme Khalifa et de M. Currie divergent en ce qui a trait aux points abord\u00e9s par M. Currie lors de leur derni\u00e8re rencontre. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Khalifa, M. Currie lui a dit que son statut de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire lui imposait trop de contraintes et l'emp\u00eachait d'accomplir son travail et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il la cong\u00e9diait. M. Currie a ni\u00e9 avoir tenu de tels propos. J'accepte sa version des faits parce qu'elle est coh\u00e9rente avec le reste de son t\u00e9moignage. Ses raisons de renvoyer Mme Khalifa \u00e9taient claires et elles sont bien document\u00e9es, comme le montre notamment le journal de Mme Murphy. Ses raisons n'avaient pas seulement trait aux retards de Mme Khalifa ou au fait qu'elle s'absentait du travail, mais \u00e0 l'incapacit\u00e9 de cette derni\u00e8re \u00e0 effectuer les t\u00e2ches qui lui \u00e9taient confi\u00e9es ainsi qu'\u00e0 sa mauvaise relation avec sa superviseure imm\u00e9diate. Il est compr\u00e9hensible que Mme Khalifa ait associ\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations de M. Currie au sujet de son absent\u00e9isme et de ses retards aux obligations qu'elle sentait reposer sur ses \u00e9paules, obligations d\u00e9coulant du fait qu'elle devait s'occuper de sa famille. Cela peut expliquer qu'elle ait interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une certaine mani\u00e8re sa conversation avec M. Currie.\n[105] Toutefois, je conclus, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les seuls \u00e9l\u00e9ments ayant pouss\u00e9 M. Currie \u00e0 mettre fin au contrat de Mme Khalifa avaient trait au travail de celle-ci, y compris \u00e0 ses probl\u00e8mes d'assiduit\u00e9 et \u00e0 sa relation avec sa sup\u00e9rieure, Mme Murphy, qui allait en se d\u00e9gradant. La situation familiale de Mme Khalifa n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la d\u00e9cision. Mme Khalifa a elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir refus\u00e9 de donner \u00e0 M. Currie des informations concernant sa vie de famille parce qu'elle se sentait mal \u00e0 l'aise de le faire. En outre, Mme Khalifa n'a produit aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve montrant que ses probl\u00e8mes de ponctualit\u00e9 ou de rendement \u00e9taient li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa situation familiale. Par exemple, la preuve montre que la plupart de ses arriv\u00e9es tardives au bureau n'ont fait l'objet d'aucune explication et qu'elles n'\u00e9taient pas caus\u00e9es par des raisons familiales, comme l'illustrent ses probl\u00e8mes de voiture. Mme Khalifa n'a jamais pr\u00e9tendu \u00eatre incapable d'accomplir le travail attendu d'elle en raison de difficult\u00e9s ou d'entraves relatives \u00e0 sa situation de famille, pas plus qu'elle n'a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d'accommodements qui lui auraient permis de s'acquitter de ses obligations.\n[106] Au lieu de cela, Mme Khalifa a essentiellement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que Mme Murphy \u00e9prouvait \u00e0 son endroit une antipathie personnelle du fait qu'elle \u00e9tait m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire et que Mme Murphy \u00e9tait parvenue \u00e0 rallier M. Currie \u00e0 son opinion. Mme Khalifa a soutenu que M. Currie avait chang\u00e9 d'attitude envers elle apr\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e de Mme Murphy, un changement qu'elle a affirm\u00e9 d\u00e9couler du fait que Mme Murphy et M. Currie croyaient tous deux que Mme Khalifa ne devrait pas travailler parce qu'elle \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. Cette all\u00e9gation n'est pas fond\u00e9e et la preuve montre finalement que la perception de Mme Khalifa \u00e9tait erron\u00e9e. M. Currie a effectivement durci le ton \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Khalifa, mais cela d\u00e9coulait directement du travail de Mme Khalifa ainsi que de son comportement avec sa superviseure imm\u00e9diate, Mme Murphy. La situation de famille de Mme Khalifa n'est pas entr\u00e9e en ligne de compte, que ce soit dans la fa\u00e7on dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e en tant qu'employ\u00e9e ou dans la d\u00e9cision ayant finalement conduit \u00e0 la r\u00e9siliation de son contrat.\n[107] Pour tous ces motifs, je conclus que la plainte pour discrimination que Mme Khalifa a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en application de l'alin\u00e9a 7a) de la LCDP n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nIII. Quel est l'\u00e9tat du droit concernant la plainte de Mme Khalifa pour harc\u00e8lement? [108] Aux termes de l'alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d'emploi.\n[109] Au sens de la LCDP, le harc\u00e8lement est une conduite non sollicit\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite, laquelle a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour les victimes (Janzen c. Platy Entreprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1284; Rampersadsingh c. Wignall (n\u00b0 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237, au paragraphe 40 (T.C.D.P.)). Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (CDP) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653, aux paragraphes 29 \u00e0 50 (1re inst.) (Franke), madame la juge Tremblay-Lamer a d\u00e9fini le crit\u00e8re permettant d'\u00e9tablir qu'il y a eu harc\u00e8lement au regard de la LCDP. Pour qu'une plainte soit fond\u00e9e, il faut d\u00e9montrer :\nque la conduite que l'intim\u00e9 a adopt\u00e9e est li\u00e9e au motif de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte; que les actes faisant l'objet de la plainte n'\u00e9taient pas sollicit\u00e9s; qu'il y a eu un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition dans la conduite reproch\u00e9e. Toutefois, en certaines circonstances, un seul incident peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour instaurer un environnement hostile. Cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment doit faire l'objet d'une analyse de la part d'une personne objective et raisonnable; que quand une plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l'encontre d'un employeur en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la conduite d'un de ses employ\u00e9s, la victime du harc\u00e8lement a, si possible, avis\u00e9 l'employeur de la conduite pr\u00e9tendument offensante.\nA. Mme Khalifa a-t-elle rempli toutes les conditions n\u00e9cessaires pour fonder sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement? [110] La plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que Mme Murphy et M. Currie l'avaient harcel\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille. Les incidents sur lesquels elle appuie ses all\u00e9gations sont les suivants :\nEn avril 2005, quand Mme Khalifa a d\u00fb partir du bureau apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un appel, Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'en tant que m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire, elle devrait envisager de trouver du travail ailleurs, dans un endroit [TRADUCTION] qui conviendrait mieux \u00e0 une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. Quand Mme Khalifa parlait d'activit\u00e9s auxquelles ses enfants avaient pris part, Mme Murphy soupirait bruyamment ou levait les yeux au ciel. Apr\u00e8s un de ces incidents, Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans son cas, il \u00e9tait acceptable de travailler parce qu'elle avait le soutien de son mari, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de Mme Khalifa. M. Currie a invit\u00e9 Mme Khalifa dans son bureau et lui a pos\u00e9 des questions personnelles au sujet de l'endroit o\u00f9 elle vivait et de ses difficult\u00e9s en tant que m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. Il lui a aussi dit de chercher un autre travail convenant mieux \u00e0 sa [TRADUCTION] situation familiale.\n[111] Je ne suis pas convaincu que la preuve confirme que ces incidents se soient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re exacte dont Mme Khalifa les a d\u00e9crits. En ce qui a trait au commentaire fait en avril 2005 par exemple, M. Jaques ne se rappelait pas que Mme Khalifa ait \u00e9t\u00e9 boulevers\u00e9e par des remarques relatives \u00e0 sa situation de m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire, mais plut\u00f4t par les [TRADUCTION] temps difficiles qu'elle connaissait sous la supervision de Mme Murphy. Cela est coh\u00e9rent avec les t\u00e9moignages de M. Currie et de Mme Murphy concernant la [TRADUCTION] supervision \u00e9troite qu'ils avaient instaur\u00e9e et \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de laquelle Mme Khalifa avait des objections.\n[112] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, j'ai conclu que Mme Murphy avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin tr\u00e8s cr\u00e9dible. Elle a ni\u00e9 avoir dit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa qu'elle devrait travailler ailleurs parce qu'elle \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire. Toutefois, Mme Murphy s'est souvenue que Mme Khalifa ait mentionn\u00e9 envisager d'accepter un poste aupr\u00e8s d'un autre organisme pendant cette p\u00e9riode, ce \u00e0 quoi Mme Murphy aurait r\u00e9pondu qu'elle l'encourageait \u00e0 explorer cette possibilit\u00e9. Mme Murphy a soutenu ne pas avoir lev\u00e9 les yeux au ciel ou soupir\u00e9 quand il \u00e9tait question de sujets d'ordre familial, contrairement \u00e0 ce que Mme Khalifa a pr\u00e9tendu. Elle a \u00e9galement ni\u00e9 avoir dit que dans son propre cas, contrairement \u00e0 Mme Khalifa, il \u00e9tait acceptable de travailler parce qu'elle \u00e9tait mari\u00e9e et qu'elle b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiait du soutien de son mari.\n[113] M. Currie, pour sa part, a ni\u00e9 avoir dit \u00e0 Mme Khalifa de [TRADUCTION] chercher un autre emploi, mais il a reconnu lui avoir dit que consid\u00e9rant qu'elle \u00e9tait malheureuse au travail, elle pourrait vouloir envisager de travailler \u00e0 un endroit qui la rendrait [TRADUCTION] plus heureuse. Il a \u00e9galement admis lui avoir demand\u00e9 comment sa famille allait un jour o\u00f9 il avait remarqu\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait troubl\u00e9e. Quand Mme Khalifa lui a dit que ces questions la mettaient mal \u00e0 l'aise, il lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ses excuses et n'a pas insist\u00e9. Il est int\u00e9ressant que M. Currie ait tout de suite reconnu avoir formul\u00e9 ces remarques, et je trouve que sa franchise ajoute du cr\u00e9dit \u00e0 l'ensemble de son t\u00e9moignage. En outre, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Khalifa lui avait demand\u00e9 de ne plus aborder le sujet avec elle, ce qui est coh\u00e9rent avec le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Khalifa elle m\u00eame, selon lequel Mme McCurdie lui aurait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment conseill\u00e9 d'agir ainsi si M. Currie lui parlait de quelque chose qui ne lui convenait pas.\n[114] Compte tenu des diff\u00e9rences existant entre le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Khalifa et celui des autres t\u00e9moins, et consid\u00e9rant la conclusion que j'ai tir\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t relativement au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Murphy, qui s'est montr\u00e9e particuli\u00e8rement cr\u00e9dible, je ne suis pas convaincu que les incidents au cours desquels Mme Khalifa aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement se soient d\u00e9roul\u00e9s exactement comme elle l'a pr\u00e9tendu.\n[115] Toutefois, m\u00eame si les incidents de harc\u00e8lement se sont pass\u00e9s comme Mme Khalifa l'a pr\u00e9tendu, je conclus que les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s n'\u00e9tablissent pas qu'il y a eu un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, ce qu'il est n\u00e9cessaire d'\u00e9tablir pour fonder une plainte de harc\u00e8lement. Sur une base raisonnable et objective, le fait que Mme Murphy ait lev\u00e9 les yeux au ciel et soupir\u00e9, m\u00eame si on l'associe au fait que M. Currie ait pos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khalifa des questions au sujet de sa famille \u00e0 une ou deux reprises et au fait que Mme Murphy ait pr\u00e9tendument fait remarquer \u00e0 Mme Khalifa qu'elle devrait envisager de travailler ailleurs ne permettent pas de remplir la troisi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re d\u00e9fini dans la d\u00e9cision Franke. M\u00eame s'il est possible que Mme Khalifa ait per\u00e7u la situation comme \u00e9tant d\u00e9stabilisante, une personne raisonnable n'aurait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 qu'une telle conduite avait eu un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou avait instaur\u00e9 un environnement hostile. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, je conclus que dans le contexte o\u00f9 M. Currie a formul\u00e9 ses commentaires relatifs \u00e0 la famille de Mme Khalifa, une personne raisonnable n'aurait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 ces commentaires comme \u00e9tant autre chose qu'un effort de sa part de faire preuve d'empathie \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la situation qui avait pu la troubler. Quoi qu'il en soit, il a mis fin \u00e0 ses questions quand Mme Khalifa l'en a pri\u00e9.\n[116] Pour finir, je conclus que la preuve ne confirme pas que les \u00e9pisodes de harc\u00e8lement dont Mme Khalifa s'est plainte se sont produits de la mani\u00e8re dont elle les a relat\u00e9s. En outre, les \u00e9v\u00e8nements, m\u00eame s'ils se sont produits comme Mme Khalifa l'a all\u00e9gu\u00e9, n'\u00e9taient pas suffisamment r\u00e9p\u00e9titifs, persistants ou s\u00e9rieux pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement au sens de la LCDP.\n[117] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement formul\u00e9es par Mme Khalifa en application de l'article 14 de la LCDP n'\u00e9taient pas non plus fond\u00e9es. Sa plainte est par cons\u00e9quent rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

INTRODUCTION [1] Il s'agit d'une plainte de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d'emploi fond\u00e9e sur l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Kasha A. Whyte (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle elle all\u00e9guait que l'intim\u00e9e, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (la Compagnie), avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en raison de sa situation de famille en ne prenant pas de mesure d'accommodement pour elle et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[2] La Compagnie nie les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n[3] Toutes les parties, y compris la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP), \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par un avocat.\n[4] Deux autres plaintes semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la Compagnie. Par entente entre les parties, le cas de Denise Seeley c. CN a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 dans une audience distincte qui a eu lieu avant la pr\u00e9sente. Bien que les plaintes de Cindy Richards et de Kasha A. Whyte aient \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues ensemble, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu pendant une conf\u00e9rence de gestion du cas que les plaintes seraient tranch\u00e9es dans deux d\u00e9cisions diff\u00e9rentes.\n[5] Bien que les faits dans l'affaire Seeley et ceux dans les affaires Richards et Whyte soient tr\u00e8s semblables et que les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie soient les m\u00eames, \u00e0 l'exception de Cathy Smolynek, qui a seulement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans les deux derni\u00e8res affaires, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l'affaire Seeley et dans les affaires Richards et Whyte est, en de nombreux points, diff\u00e9rente. Sans n\u00e9cessairement se contredire, les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie qui avaient t\u00e9moign\u00e9 auparavant dans l'affaire Seeley n'ont pas r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 exactement le m\u00eame t\u00e9moignage dans les affaires Richards et Whyte. De plus, des documents qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience de l'affaire Seeley ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve dans les affaires Richards et Whyte. Ces diff\u00e9rences expliqueront toute divergence qui puisse exister dans les faits des affaires Richards et Whyte en comparaison avec la d\u00e9cision Seeley.\nA. LES FAITS (i) La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada a) Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [6] La Compagnie est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sous r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui tire ses revenus du transport de biens par train. Il s'agit d'une compagnie de chemins de fer transcontinentale qui op\u00e8re au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Les trains de marchandises transportent des biens 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, 365 jours par ann\u00e9e.\n[7] La Compagnie a plus de 15 000 employ\u00e9s au Canada. Ces employ\u00e9s sont organis\u00e9s en deux groupes distincts d\u00e9crits comme un groupe op\u00e9rationnel et un groupe non op\u00e9rationnel. Le groupe non op\u00e9rationnel est constitu\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s qui occupent des postes en administration, en m\u00e9canique et en ing\u00e9nierie. Les employ\u00e9s du groupe op\u00e9rationnel, aussi connus sous le nom de personnel des trains, sont des chefs de train et des m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives.\n[8] La Compagnie compte plus de 4 000 employ\u00e9s du personnel des trains \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du Canada, dont 2 400 sont des chefs de train. Selon Mme Stephanie Ziemer, une agente des ressources humaines de la Compagnie \u00e0 Vancouver, le nombre de chefs de train en 2005 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, soit 2 500 employ\u00e9s.\n[9] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question de l'avocat de la Compagnie, Mme Ziemer a expliqu\u00e9 que la Compagnie ne fait pas de suivi au sujet du nombre de ses employ\u00e9s qui ont des enfants. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ce renseignement ne peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9 que lorsque l'employ\u00e9 s'inscrit aux prestations d'assurance collective de la Compagnie. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] selon ces renseignements, environ 69 p. 100 de nos employ\u00e9s ont des enfants. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, cette information aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour en mai 2009. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle [TRADUCTION] estimerait que [ce pourcentage] est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 parce que ce ne sont pas tous les employ\u00e9s qui participent aux prestations d'assurance collective, en particulier s'ils ont un \u00e9poux qui a une assurance collective \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la Compagnie.\n[10] Lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante lui a pos\u00e9 des questions au sujet de la fiabilit\u00e9 de ces chiffres, Mme Ziemer a expliqu\u00e9 qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis par le gestionnaire de l'administration des prestations de la Compagnie \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. L'avocat de la Compagnie a ensuite montr\u00e9 aux avocats de la plaignante et de la CCDP ce que l'avocate de la plaignante a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] un gros paquet de noms \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s en fonction de ce qui semble \u00eatre un ordre par num\u00e9ro d'employ\u00e9. Bien que cette liste identifiait les chefs de train et leurs personnes \u00e0 charge, l'avocate de la plaignante a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait [TRADUCTION] rien au sujet d'un taux de 69 p. 100. Elle a donc conclu que [TRADUCTION] quelqu'un devait avoir pris ce document et avoir fait des calculs. Elle a alors demand\u00e9 que les documents sur lesquels les calculs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits soient produits en preuve.\n[11] M. Paquette, l'avocat de la Compagnie, a expliqu\u00e9 que les calculs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par [TRADUCTION] quelqu'un au service juridique de la Compagnie. Il a alors ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s probable que cette personne avait communiqu\u00e9 ces chiffres au t\u00e9moin. Lorsque le pr\u00e9sident a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocat si, lorsque Mme Ziemer avait mentionn\u00e9 que les chiffres lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par quelqu'un \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, elle parlait du service juridique, l'avocat a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s probablement, mais il a ajout\u00e9 que l'information m\u00eame provenait du service des ressources humaines de la Compagnie. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait simplement d'une question de [TRADUCTION] s'asseoir et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'addition un par un.\n[12] En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Ziemer a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas effectu\u00e9 les calculs elle-m\u00eame. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le taux de 69 p. 100 pour les deux groupes lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au cours d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, mais elle \u00e9tait incapable de se souvenir du nom de la personne qui lui avait donn\u00e9 l'information. Au sujet du [TRADUCTION] gros paquet de noms, Mme Ziemer a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle avait vu ce document pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 l'audience. Compte tenu des explications de Mme Ziemer, le Tribunal accordera peu de poids \u00e0 cette partie de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[13] Pour des raisons op\u00e9rationnelles, la Compagnie est divis\u00e9e en deux grandes r\u00e9gions, la r\u00e9gion de l'Est et la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. La r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest comprend tous les terminaux ferroviaires de la Compagnie \u00e0 partir de Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique) jusqu'\u00e0 Thunder Bay (Ontario).\n[14] Le Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes (le CGE) \u00e0 Edmonton est une partie tr\u00e8s importante des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie. Il est responsable de tous les appels des \u00e9quipes et les d\u00e9ploiements pour la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Il g\u00e8re le d\u00e9ploiement du personnel des trains et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, dont le budget total est de 204 millions de dollars. Le CGE est compos\u00e9 de cinquante-quatre (54) employ\u00e9s qui rel\u00e8vent d'Elaine Storms, la directrice du CGE. Mme Storms occupait ce poste en 2005 et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin important pour la Compagnie \u00e0 l'audience.\n[15] La Compagnie a aussi un [TRADUCTION] service du personnel qui comprend les ressources humaines et les relations de travail. Bien que ces deux groupes rel\u00e8vent du m\u00eame service, ils ont des fonctions tr\u00e8s distinctes. Les ressources humaines traitent, entre autres, des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, alors que les relations de travail traitent des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la convention collective. En 2005, Mary-Jane Morrison \u00e9tait la personne aux ressources humaines en charge du portefeuille du personnel des trains \u00e0 Jasper.\nb) Le personnel des trains [16] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives et les chefs de train font partie du groupe portant le nom de personnel des trains. Les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives font fonctionner le moteur et les chefs de train sont, au fond, responsables de tous les autres aspects li\u00e9s au mouvement du train.\n[17] Le personnel des trains travaille soit sur la [TRADUCTION] route ou au [TRADUCTION] triage. Le [TRADUCTION] travail de route est effectu\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s qui embarquent dans un train \u00e0 un terminal en particulier et qui am\u00e8nent le train \u00e0 un autre terminal. Un employ\u00e9 de triage travaille g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la gare de triage, transf\u00e9rant les wagons couverts et embo\u00eetant les trains. Un employ\u00e9 de triage n'a pas besoin de quitter le terminal.\n[18] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'embauche, la Compagnie a tendance \u00e0 embaucher son personnel des trains en groupes. Selon Mme Ziemer, la Compagnie a embauch\u00e9 beaucoup d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 70 et [TRADUCTION] un peu d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 80 et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une [TRADUCTION] embauche importante de 2005 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de 2009.\n[19] En 1996, le pourcentage de femmes dans le personnel des trains \u00e9tait d'environ 3 p. 100. Cette donn\u00e9e \u00e9tait de 3,7 p. 100 en 2006 et se situe maintenant \u00e0 environ 3,1 p. 100.\n[20] Le co\u00fbt pour la formation d'un chef de train est d'environ 50 000 $ \u00e0 80 000 $. Ce montant comprend le salaire de l'employ\u00e9 et de l'instructeur et aussi, si n\u00e9cessaire, leur h\u00e9bergement. La formation prend de quatre (4) \u00e0 six (6) mois. Le co\u00fbt de la formation d'un m\u00e9canicien de locomotives est d'environ 28 000 $ \u00e0 30 000 $, en plus du co\u00fbt de sa formation comme chef de train.\n[21] Afin de se qualifier pour travailler comme chef de train, un employ\u00e9 doit faire mettre \u00e0 jour sa fiche de r\u00e8gles et sa fiche m\u00e9dicale. Ces fiches doivent \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9es tous les trois ans. Si un employ\u00e9 est au tableau de service, il recevra g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un avis lui disant que ses fiches expireront bient\u00f4t et il n'a qu'\u00e0 prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour les faire mettre \u00e0 jour. Si l'employ\u00e9 est en mise \u00e0 pied, il devra le faire lui-m\u00eame, bien que pour la fiche de r\u00e8gles, il aura besoin de l'approbation de son superviseur.\n[22] Lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 travaille ou est disponible pour travailler, on dit qu'il est au [TRADUCTION] tableau de service. Le tableau de service comprend tous les employ\u00e9s qui ne sont pas mis \u00e0 pied. Les employ\u00e9s qui sont au tableau de service sont soit en affectation, soit dans un bassin.\n[23] Un employ\u00e9 peut aussi \u00eatre affect\u00e9, ce qui signifie qu'il sera au tableau de service \u00e0 son terminal. La d\u00e9cision d'affecter un employ\u00e9 est prise par le gestionnaire du terminal. Cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur le nombre d'employ\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires au terminal pour effectuer le travail pr\u00e9vu.\n[24] Il y a aussi un autre tableau, qui fait partie du tableau de service et qui porte le nom de [TRADUCTION] tableau de remplacement ou de [TRADUCTION] tableau d'urgence. Les employ\u00e9s dont le nom figure \u00e0 ce tableau sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler seulement pour remplacer des employ\u00e9s qui sont soit en vacances, soit incapables de travailler pour d'autres raisons.\n[25] En raison de la nature des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie, le personnel des trains doit \u00eatre disponible pour travailler \u00e0 l'endroit et au moment requis, dans le respect des restrictions impos\u00e9es par la loi et par la convention collective. Compte tenu de ces exigences, la Compagnie est d'avis que la mobilit\u00e9 et la flexibilit\u00e9 constituent des conditions d'emploi de base pour ces employ\u00e9s. Elle est d'avis que ces exigences sont n\u00e9cessaires compte tenu du volume de biens que la Compagnie transporte et de la fluctuation en mati\u00e8re de demande qui peut exister pendant une courte p\u00e9riode en raison, par exemple, de changements dans l'\u00e9conomie ou de facteurs saisonniers tels que la saison de la moisson du grain.\n[26] L'horaire de travail d'un chef de train est tr\u00e8s impr\u00e9visible. Selon le tableau auquel le chef de train est inscrit, il a plus ou moins de connaissances au sujet du type de travail qu'il pourrait avoir \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter. Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes les affectations de travail sur la route ont des horaires enti\u00e8rement impr\u00e9visibles. On s'attend \u00e0 ce qu'un chef de train soit en mesure de se pr\u00e9senter au travail dans les deux heures suivant la r\u00e9ception d'un appel du CGE. Lorsqu'un chef de train se pr\u00e9sente au travail, il n'a aucune id\u00e9e du moment exact o\u00f9 il retournera \u00e0 la maison. Il peut \u00eatre parti pendant quelques heures, jusqu'\u00e0 presque deux jours.\n[27] Le travail du personnel des trains est fond\u00e9 sur le millage. Le tableau de service est ajust\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on hebdomadaire afin que chaque employ\u00e9 puisse faire environ 4 300 milles par mois. Lorsque la Compagnie ajuste le tableau de service, elle examine les donn\u00e9es de la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente afin de voir combien de milles les employ\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9s. Elle divise ce nombre par 4 300 et le r\u00e9sultat indique le nombre d'employ\u00e9s qui serait probablement n\u00e9cessaire dans un terminal en particulier la semaine suivante.\n[28] Pendant toutes les p\u00e9riodes en cause, les chefs de train dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest du Canada \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les Travailleurs unis du transport (le Syndicat). La convention collective applicable aux chefs de train dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest est la convention collective 4.3 (la convention collective).\nc) Les changements effectu\u00e9s en 1992 et la cr\u00e9ation du tableau de cong\u00e9s\n[29] En 1992, des changements dans la technologie ont permis \u00e0 la Compagnie d'\u00e9liminer le wagon \u00e0 la fin du train, qui est commun\u00e9ment connu sous le nom de wagon de queue. Cette d\u00e9cision a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'\u00e9limination du poste de serre-frein. Apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision, les chefs de train qui travaillaient dans le wagon de queue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avant du train avec les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives. L'\u00e9limination du poste de serre-frein signifiait que la Compagnie avait besoin de moins de personnel des trains pour faire fonctionner ses trains. La r\u00e9duction dans le nombre d'employ\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e pendant le processus de n\u00e9gociation avec le syndicat. La n\u00e9gociation a entra\u00een\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation du [TRADUCTION] tableau de cong\u00e9s.\n[30] Un tableau de cong\u00e9s est cr\u00e9\u00e9 lorsqu'il y a un surplus d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 un terminal, mais pas suffisamment de travail pour tous. L'employ\u00e9 dont le nom figure au tableau de cong\u00e9s doit rester disponible pour le travail, mais s'il n'est pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler, il re\u00e7oit tout de m\u00eame son salaire. Seule une certaine cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s peut soumissionner pour le tableau de cong\u00e9s. Ces employ\u00e9s portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, alors que les employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s ne peuvent pas s'inscrire au tableau de cong\u00e9s.\n[31] Les changements effectu\u00e9s aux conditions de travail en 1992 ont aussi cr\u00e9\u00e9 la notion de [TRADUCTION] for\u00e7age, qui produit diff\u00e9rents r\u00e9sultats pour diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories d'employ\u00e9s dans le personnel des trains. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 148.11 de la convention collective, les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 29 juin 1990 peuvent \u00eatre forc\u00e9s de travailler dans un autre terminal dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest et ont l'obligation de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce terminal au plus tard dans les trente (30) jours suivant l'appel, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne pr\u00e9sentent une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier le fait qu'ils ne se pr\u00e9senteront pas. Ces employ\u00e9s sont commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie D. Ils sont aussi appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, parce qu'ils ont l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel au travail \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de leur terminal.\n[32] L'autre cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s comprend les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant le 29 juin 1990. Ces employ\u00e9s sont appel\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Dans ce groupe d'employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, on retrouve ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant 1982 et qui portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie A et de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie B, respectivement. Ces employ\u00e9s ne peuvent pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail ailleurs qu'\u00e0 leur terminal local. Les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 1982, mais avant le 29 juin 1990, portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie C et peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail \u00e0 des terminaux adjacents. Par exemple, les employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie C du terminal de Jasper peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s aux terminaux adjacents d'Edson et de Kamloops.\n[33] Le statut d'employ\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le nombre de ces employ\u00e9s diminuera au cours des ann\u00e9es simplement par l'attrition, et le statut dispara\u00eetra \u00e9ventuellement compl\u00e8tement.\n[34] \u00c0 la suite de la cr\u00e9ation du tableau de cong\u00e9s, qui essentiellement permet \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s d'\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 leur terminal local, la Compagnie devait trouver une fa\u00e7on de combler des postes en cas de p\u00e9nuries dans d'autres terminaux. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que la clause 148.11 de la convention collective est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. C'est cette disposition qui permet \u00e0 la Compagnie de forcer les employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 se rendre dans d'autres terminaux de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour couvrir les p\u00e9nuries.\n[35] Avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la clause 148.11, la Compagnie obtenait des employ\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie en produisant des TRADUCTION bulletins de p\u00e9nurie et en permettant aux employ\u00e9s de se porter volontaires en cas de p\u00e9nurie, s'ils le d\u00e9siraient. Ces bulletins \u00e9taient produits \u00e0 chaque [TRADUCTION] changement de fiche, soit environ quatre fois par ann\u00e9e. Comme il est difficile pour la Compagnie de pr\u00e9voir o\u00f9 une p\u00e9nurie aura lieu, ces bulletins couvraient divers endroits, qu'il y ait r\u00e9ellement une p\u00e9nurie ou non. Les employ\u00e9s qui souhaitaient r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie dans un certain endroit se portaient volontaires pour cet endroit, et s'il y avait une p\u00e9nurie au terminal en question, l'employ\u00e9 qui s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9 volontaire \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 aller y travailler.\n[36] La Compagnie affiche toujours des bulletins de p\u00e9nurie, et les employ\u00e9s peuvent toujours se porter volontaires suivant ces bulletins, mais comme les employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s peuvent maintenant rester \u00e0 leur terminal local, au tableau de cong\u00e9s, et tout de m\u00eame recevoir leur salaire, ils n'ont gu\u00e8re d'avantage \u00e0 se porter volontaires en cas de p\u00e9nurie.\n[37] La Compagnie utilise aussi un syst\u00e8me connu sous le nom de [TRADUCTION] dotation suivant le tableau de remplacement ( en anglais, whitemanning ), qui lui permet d'envoyer les employ\u00e9s en surplus dans un terminal \u00e0 un terminal adjacent. Par exemple, dans un tel sc\u00e9nario, des employ\u00e9s de Kamloops (C.-B.) conduiraient des trains que les \u00e9quipes de Vancouver conduisent normalement jusqu'\u00e0 Kamloops. Selon Mme Storms, la [TRADUCTION] dotation suivant le tableau de remplacement est la premi\u00e8re solution que la Compagnie utilise en cas de p\u00e9nurie, parce qu'elle est beaucoup plus \u00e9conomique que celle de forcer des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie.\n[38] Il est aussi possible qu'on demande \u00e0 des gestionnaires de travailler pendant une situation de p\u00e9nurie. Presque tous les gestionnaires des transports sont qualifi\u00e9s pour conduire des trains. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Compagnie demandera aux gestionnaires de conduire des trains en dernier recours, lorsqu'elle a \u00e9puis\u00e9 le personnel des trains, y compris les employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied.\n[39] Les employ\u00e9s qui sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 un autre terminal en vertu de la clause 148.11 de la convention collective ont droit \u00e0 certaines commodit\u00e9s au terminal qui leur est assign\u00e9. Ces commodit\u00e9s comprennent, lorsqu'elles sont disponibles, des chambres \u00e9quip\u00e9es d'une cuisinette et aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de retourner \u00e0 la maison \u00e0 des intervalles r\u00e9guliers ou, subsidiairement, la possibilit\u00e9 que la Compagnie d\u00e9fraie le co\u00fbt associ\u00e9 au transport d'un membre de la famille jusqu'au lieu de la p\u00e9nurie.\n[40] L'alin\u00e9a 148.11f) de la convention collective stipule que le premier employ\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie sera l'employ\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 le moins ancien qui est en mise \u00e0 pied dans le territoire d'anciennet\u00e9 et dont la date d'anciennet\u00e9 est ult\u00e9rieure au 29 juin 1990. La convention collective ne pr\u00e9voit pas de dur\u00e9e maximale pour la couverture d'une p\u00e9nurie. Si la p\u00e9nurie devient permanente, la Compagnie embauchera alors des employ\u00e9s pour le lieu touch\u00e9.\n[41] La clause 115 de la convention collective stipule qu'un employ\u00e9 qui est mis \u00e0 pied sera prioritaire pour le r\u00e9emploi si l'effectif est augment\u00e9 dans son district de s\u00e9niorit\u00e9 et qu'il reprendra du service par ordre d'anciennet\u00e9. Cette clause stipule aussi que si l'employ\u00e9 travaille ailleurs au moment du rappel, il peut obtenir trente (30) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail. S'il ne se pr\u00e9sente pas au travail et qu'il ne donne pas de [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter, il renonce \u00e0 ses droits d'anciennet\u00e9.\n[42] Un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite soulever une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter au travail doit d'abord pr\u00e9senter sa demande au Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes (le CGE). On lui donne alors l'instruction d'\u00e9crire une lettre \u00e0 son superviseur imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 son terminal local. Si la raison soulev\u00e9e peut avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la convention collective, il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de discuter avec le syndicat.\n(ii) La plaignante [43] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par la Compagnie \u00e0 Jasper (Alberta), le 1er avril 1991. Elle a d'abord travaill\u00e9 comme serre-frein, jusqu'\u00e0 sa qualification comme chef de train en 1993. Elle a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme chef de train jusqu'\u00e0 sa mise \u00e0 pied en septembre 1998.\n[44] Pendant sa carri\u00e8re, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 divers terminaux ferroviaires pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries, tout en gardant le terminal de Jasper comme terminal local. En 1993, elle a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Calgary pendant presque un an, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle soit rappel\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper en 1994. En 1996, elle s'est port\u00e9e volontaire pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver et y a travaill\u00e9 pendant environ trois mois. En 1998, elle s'est port\u00e9e volontaire pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une autre p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Terrace (C.-B.). Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper en ao\u00fbt 1998, o\u00f9 elle a travaill\u00e9 pendant deux mois avant d'\u00eatre mise \u00e0 pied.\n[45] En automne 1998, elle est tomb\u00e9e enceinte, et son fils est n\u00e9 en juin 1999. Elle a alors pris cong\u00e9, mais est ensuite retourn\u00e9e au statut [TRADUCTION] disponible, en mise \u00e0 pied. De 1999 \u00e0 2001, elle a travaill\u00e9 en fonction du tableau des urgences \u00e0 Jasper. Le travail en fonction du tableau des urgences \u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rendu possible en raison d'une entente locale conclue en 1998 entre les repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat \u00e0 Jasper et les gestionnaires du terminal. Cette entente permettait aux chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied inscrits au tableau d'urgence d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler avant les employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s en vigueur. L'entente locale a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en 2001, lorsque la Compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait \u00eatre en mesure d'appeler les employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s en vigueur avant les employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied. La Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que, comme elle payait une garantie pour les employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s, mais pas aux employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied, il \u00e9tait financi\u00e8rement avantageux pour elle d'utiliser les employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s avant de rappeler les employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied pour effectuer du travail d'urgence. Apr\u00e8s ce changement, compte tenu du nombre d'employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper, il n'y a plus eu d'occasion pour un employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied qui s'\u00e9tait inscrit au tableau d'urgence d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler.\n[46] En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle comprenait que le fait de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries faisait partie de son travail et que les chefs de train pouvaient \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler ailleurs qu'\u00e0 leur terminal local. Elle a m\u00eame ajout\u00e9 qu'elle aimait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries, mais que, compte tenu de sa situation de famille en 2005, elle \u00e9tait incapable de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[47] La plaignante est une m\u00e8re seule qui a la garde unique et enti\u00e8re de son fils. Bien que le p\u00e8re reste en contact r\u00e9gulier avec son fils, la plaignante a la responsabilit\u00e9 principale quant \u00e0 tous les aspects du r\u00f4le parental. Les grands-parents paternels du fils de la plaignante sont ses voisins et ils ont une excellente relation avec leur petit-fils.\n[48] Le p\u00e8re est propri\u00e9taire d'une pourvoirie et il am\u00e8ne ses clients \u00e0 la montage en exp\u00e9ditions dans la nature. \u00c0 l'hiver, il dirige aussi un pavillon de ski. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la nature du travail du p\u00e8re l'emp\u00eache presque enti\u00e8rement de s'acquitter de ses responsabilit\u00e9s et obligations parentales.\n[49] En 2002, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied, la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une sollicitation du Union Pacific Railroad, qui avait besoin de chefs de trains pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 St. Louis (Missouri), aux \u00c9tats Unis. Elle y a travaill\u00e9 du 2 ao\u00fbt au 15 d\u00e9cembre 2002. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de laisser son fils, qui avait alors trois ans, sous la garde de ses grands-parents paternels. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'alors qu'elle \u00e9tait aux \u00c9tats-Unis, son absence n'avait pas sembl\u00e9 avoir d'effet n\u00e9gatif sur son fils, mais qu'\u00e0 son retour \u00e0 la maison, elle a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu'elle avait fait une erreur en d\u00e9cidant de le laisser au Canada. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9 par son absence. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur les \u00e9motions de son fils \u00e9taient \u00e9videntes. Elle a donn\u00e9 comme exemple le fait qu'il refusait d'\u00eatre s\u00e9par\u00e9 d'elle et qu'il devenait boulevers\u00e9 lorsqu'elle s'absentait. Lorsque son p\u00e8re venait le chercher, il refusait de quitter la maison. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait beaucoup appris de cette situation et qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 moins de pouvoir amener son fils avec elle, elle ne r\u00e9p\u00e8terait pas l'exp\u00e9rience.\n[50] \u00c0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2003, le service des ressources humaines du Union Pacific Railroad a communiqu\u00e9 avec la plaignante au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une autre p\u00e9nurie. Elle a accept\u00e9 l'offre et s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au travail \u00e0 Tucson (Arizona), aux \u00c9tats-Unis, du 28 octobre 2003 au 15 mars 2004.\n[51] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, compte tenu des r\u00e9percussions que son travail \u00e0 St. Louis avait eu sur son fils, elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 cette fois de ne pas laisser son fils au Canada. Avec l'aide du service des ressources humaines du Union Pacific Railroad, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de louer un appartement \u00e0 Tucson d'une taille suffisante pour lui permettre d'y habiter avec son fils et un membre de la famille. La compagnie de chemins de fer a pay\u00e9 les frais de d\u00e9placement jusqu'\u00e0 Tucson pour la plaignante, son fils et le p\u00e8re de celui-ci. Apr\u00e8s un certain temps, les grands-parents paternels sont venus afin que le p\u00e8re puisse retourner travailler \u00e0 Jasper.\n[52] La plaignante a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, pendant cette p\u00e9riode elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 seule pendant un mois et demi \u00e0 deux mois. Pendant ce temps, son fils est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper avec ses grands-parents paternels.\n[53] Apr\u00e8s son retour \u00e0 Jasper, la plaignante a remarqu\u00e9 que son fils toussait beaucoup et qu'il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 respirer lorsqu'il jouait. Elle s'est inqui\u00e9t\u00e9e et a demand\u00e9 un avis m\u00e9dical. En janvier 2005, l'\u00e9tat de son fils s'est aggrav\u00e9 et son m\u00e9decin l'a dirig\u00e9e \u00e0 un sp\u00e9cialiste. Elle a pu obtenir un rendez-vous pr\u00e9vu pour avril 2005. Son fils a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de difficult\u00e9s respiratoires.\n(iii) La p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver [54] En f\u00e9vrier 2005, la Compagnie subissait une importante p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 son terminal de Vancouver. Cette situation \u00e9tait due principalement \u00e0 la croissance de l'\u00e9conomie et \u00e0 l'augmentation du volume d'activit\u00e9s de la Compagnie, qui avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir suffisamment de personnel des trains localement pour g\u00e9rer le travail \u00e0 accomplir. Selon Mme Storms, soixante-douze (72) chefs de train \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie et il n'y avait que cinquante-trois (53) chefs de train sur place, donc il en manquait dix-neuf (19). Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'[TRADUCTION] il s'agissait incontestablement de l'une des p\u00e9nuries les plus importantes que j'aie vues dans ma carri\u00e8re.\n[55] Pour accentuer l'importance de cette p\u00e9nurie, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant la p\u00e9riode du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2005 au 15 janvier 2006, \u00e0 la gare de triage de Vancouver, il y avait eu 726 quarts de travail en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, constituant une d\u00e9pense totale de 229 350,30 $. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces chiffres comprenaient les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es non seulement par les chefs de train, mais aussi par les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives et possiblement par les chefs de triage.\n[56] Mme Storms a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que vers la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, le terminal de Jasper \u00e9tait en situation de surplus. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsque, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas \u00e0 Jasper, un terminal a un tableau de cong\u00e9s, qu'il soutient d'autres terminaux avec des employ\u00e9s dot\u00e9s en fonction du tableau de remplacement et que des employ\u00e9s sont mis \u00e0 pied, il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre en situation de surplus. Cependant, elle a reconnu qu'en 2005, les gestionnaires \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s comme chefs de train \u00e0 Jasper en raison des retards des trains. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que pendant une [TRADUCTION] partie de 2005, l'achalandage a augment\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper et qu'apr\u00e8s le 6 ao\u00fbt 2005, il n'y avait plus d'employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s \u00e0 cet endroit.\n[57] En raison de son emplacement, le terminal de Vancouver est tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9. Il comprend une importante gare de triage et des op\u00e9rations intermodales o\u00f9 les biens sont transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de navires et vers les navires. Le terminal de Vancouver constitue par cons\u00e9quent un centre de liaison pour le march\u00e9 canadien de la Compagnie, parce qu'une grande quantit\u00e9 de mat\u00e9riaux et de biens de consommation provenant de l'Asie et de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, et export\u00e9s vers l'Asie et l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, passe par Vancouver et est ensuite transport\u00e9e partout au Canada sur le r\u00e9seau ferroviaire de la Compagnie.\n[58] Une p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 Vancouver a d'importantes r\u00e9percussions, car elle peut avoir des incidences sur la capacit\u00e9 de la Compagnie \u00e0 fonctionner ad\u00e9quatement partout dans son r\u00e9seau.\n[59] Afin de maintenir son niveau d'op\u00e9ration, la Compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2005 de rappeler des chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie qui touchait le terminal de Vancouver. Ces employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dont la date d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait ult\u00e9rieure au 29 juin 1990. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils \u00e9taient vis\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 148.11c) de la convention collective.\n[60] D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Storms, les p\u00e9nuries sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es par le [TRADUCTION] Groupe de rajustement des tableaux du CGE. Ce groupe, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9 par Joe Lyon, qui relevait directement de Mme Storms. Le Groupe de rajustement des tableaux a g\u00e9r\u00e9 la p\u00e9nurie de 2005 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais comme il manquait d'effectif, des r\u00e9partiteurs d'\u00e9quipes ont aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la communication avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n[61] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle s'\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 Vancouver pour aider \u00e0 l'affectation des agents. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que des gestionnaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s de partout au Canada pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que 2 144 tours de service avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 couverts par des gestionnaires pendant la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que cela [TRADUCTION] a \u00e9t\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 des gestionnaires le plus important que j'aie vu dans l'Ouest dans ma carri\u00e8re.\n[62] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e possible de cette p\u00e9nurie, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si la plaignante s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver, elle y serait probablement rest\u00e9e pendant environ un an, puisque la situation de p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue avant 2006.\n[63] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Ziemer, la p\u00e9nurie a \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue [TRADUCTION] apr\u00e8s quelques ann\u00e9es parce que la Compagnie a [TRADUCTION] embauch\u00e9 le bon nombre d'employ\u00e9s afin de tenir compte des attritions et de la croissance importante de l'entreprise. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le march\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 Vancouver est tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9titif : [TRADUCTION] Malheureusement, l'industrie de la construction \u00e9tait en pleine expansion. Nous avions aussi perdu beaucoup de candidats en raison de l'expansion de l'industrie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re dans le Nord de l'Alberta. [...] [I]l nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile de recruter pendant ces deux ann\u00e9es [2005 et 2006], et c'est devenu cyclique. Nous n'avions pas suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s retenus dans le processus de s\u00e9lection pour le recrutement, donc nous devions afficher de nouvelles offres d'emploi et tenir de nombreux salons des carri\u00e8res. Nous avons d\u00fb afficher des offres d'emploi \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que nous ayons suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 cyclique de 2005 jusqu'\u00e0 probablement la moiti\u00e9 de 2007.\n[64] Les employ\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9sentaient au terminal de Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie devaient se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la gare de triage Thornton, \u00e0 Surrey, et de l\u00e0, comme Vancouver avait beaucoup de gares de triage, ils \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s aux endroits o\u00f9 leurs services \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Les employ\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient inform\u00e9s de l'endroit o\u00f9 ils allaient travailler et du quart de travail qu'ils allaient occuper que lorsqu'ils arrivaient \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[65] Mme Ziemer a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des dispositions prises quant \u00e0 l'h\u00e9bergement pour les employ\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9sentaient \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il y avait deux h\u00f4tels disponibles \u00e0 Surrey (C.-B.). L'un de ces h\u00f4tels \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs p\u00e2t\u00e9s de maisons des gares de triage de la Compagnie. Selon les souvenirs de Mme Ziemer, cet h\u00f4tel [TRADUCTION] avait de grandes suites avec des r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateurs et il y avait une cuisine collective pour les employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie. L'autre h\u00f4tel \u00e9tait plus pr\u00e8s des gares de triage et avait aussi des suites. Mme Ziemer a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Je crois qu'il y avait aussi des cuisines dans ces suites.\n[66] Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Compagnie pouvait approuver la location d'une maison, d'un appartement ou d'une copropri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 une situation qui avait eu lieu \u00e0 Vancouver - bien qu'elle n'ait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 quel moment - lors de laquelle la Compagnie avait approuv\u00e9 la location d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 parce que le prix de la location \u00e9tait plus logique du point de vue \u00e9conomique que de payer [TRADUCTION] 90 $ par nuit ou 100 $ par nuit pour un h\u00f4tel pour les 20 ou 30 jours o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 serait sur place pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n(iv) Les chefs de train qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver [67] Quarante-sept (47) chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver en f\u00e9vrier 2005. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9, en commen\u00e7ant par la personne avec le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 dans le district. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie ne permettait pas \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui avait de l'anciennet\u00e9 de refuser une occasion de travailler, parce que cela signifierait qu'il ne prot\u00e9geait pas son anciennet\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque du rappel, la plaignante \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re sur la liste d'anciennet\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied au terminal de Jasper.\n[68] Des quarante-sept (47) employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s, dix (10) se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver et trente (30) ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et ont d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. Pour les sept (7) employ\u00e9s restants, soit ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9s du d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Vancouver, soit leurs services \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leur terminal local.\n[69] Les quarante-sept (47) employ\u00e9s ont d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 joints par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Selon Mme Storms, lorsque ces employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s, on leur a dit qu'ils avaient quinze (15) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait avis\u00e9 son groupe de ne pas offrir de renseignements au sujet de la dur\u00e9e possible de la p\u00e9nurie, puisque ce renseignement n'\u00e9tait pas disponible.\n[70] \u00c0 l'audience, la Compagnie a produit des feuilles de calcul Excel qui donnaient des renseignements pertinents au sujet de cinq employ\u00e9s qui, selon l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Compagnie, s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver. L'avocat de la CCDP a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie de produire les m\u00eames renseignements qu'elle avait produits pour ces cinq employ\u00e9s, pour les quarante-deux autres employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver. Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous la forme de feuilles de calcul Excel et contenaient de nombreuses pages de renseignements au sujet du statut des employ\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause.\n[71] Selon la liste des pi\u00e8ces de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, la Compagnie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les dossiers CATS pour cinq employ\u00e9s. (Voir pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglets 27 \u00e0 31 inclusivement.) Elle a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux autres dossiers CATS. (Voir les pi\u00e8ces R-10 et R-11.) Les avocats ont interrog\u00e9 et contre-interrog\u00e9 Mme Storms avec rigueur sur ces documents. Quant \u00e0 elle, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les dossiers CATS de quinze autres employ\u00e9s. (Voir les pi\u00e8ces HR-1, onglet 5 jusqu'\u00e0 l'onglet 10 et HR-2, onglet 23 jusqu'\u00e0 l'onglet 30.)\n[72] Le reste des dossiers CATS divulgu\u00e9s par la Compagnie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve par l'avocate de la plaignante (voir la pi\u00e8ce C-33). Ces documents n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve dans le format dans lequel la Compagnie les avait fournis. L'avocate de la plaignante, pendant son contre interrogatoire de Mme Storms, a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 ce qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] un document dans un nouveau format en r\u00e9organisant les renseignements contenus dans la feuille de calcul Excel originale produite par la Compagnie. Ce nouveau document a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9organis\u00e9 de telle fa\u00e7on \u00e0 montrer quels employ\u00e9s appel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9taient disponibles \u00e0 diverses dates en 2005.\n[73] Le dernier jour de l'audience, l'avocat de la Compagnie a soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la justesse de certains des renseignements sur les feuilles de calcul. Le 18 janvier 2010, plus de deux mois apr\u00e8s l'audience, la Compagnie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir la permission de rouvrir le dossier afin de pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles preuves. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision 2010 TCDP 6.\n[74] La Compagnie a produit les documents et, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 not\u00e9, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de les inclure dans le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Storms. Nous pouvons d\u00e9duire que la Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que Mme Storms connaissait suffisamment les renseignements apparaissant dans ces documents pour pouvoir t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 leur sujet. J'examinerai certains des renseignements contenus dans ces documents en d\u00e9tail, parce qu'ils \u00e9taient importants pour toutes les parties. Afin de prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s, ils seront identifi\u00e9s par des lettres qui ne correspondent pas \u00e0 leurs noms r\u00e9els.\n[75] Les documents indiquent que l'employ\u00e9 AB, bien qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9, ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour combler la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Le 22 mars 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au terminal de Sioux Lookout. Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 y travailler jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'avait pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. Bien que cet employ\u00e9 e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 le 22 mars, le document indique qu'il a seulement travaill\u00e9 le 24 mars et qu'ensuite, il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 1er avril. Apr\u00e8s cette date, il a travaill\u00e9 le 10 et le 11 avril, mais n'a plus travaill\u00e9 avant le 18 avril. Le 22 juillet, il a pris un cong\u00e9 et n'est retourn\u00e9 au travail que le 12 ao\u00fbt. Il a travaill\u00e9 de cette date jusqu'au 20 ao\u00fbt, mais il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cette date jusqu'au 22 septembre. Il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau le 30 septembre, puis n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 28 octobre. Pendant les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il ne travaillait pas, l'employ\u00e9 ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour combler la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver.\n[76] L'employ\u00e9 HI travaillait dans une p\u00e9riode de p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne au moment du rappel. Il a travaill\u00e9 dans le cadre de cette p\u00e9nurie jusqu'au 18 mai 2005. Apr\u00e8s cela, il est rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison pendant une semaine, puis s'est rendu \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie le 30 mai. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 19 septembre 2005. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Francis le 29 octobre et y a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[77] Selon les documents produits par la Compagnie, alors qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 Vancouver, cet employ\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 par effectuer quatre (4) tours de formation. Apr\u00e8s la fin de sa formation le 3 juin, il a seulement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 9 juin. Mme Storms a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible que pendant ce temps, il \u00e9tait toujours en formation, bien qu'elle ne puisse pas en \u00eatre certaine. Apr\u00e8s le 9 juin, il est inscrit comme \u00e9tant disponible du 17 juin jusqu'au 26 juin, puis il est inscrit qu'il \u00e9tait en millage. Cela signifie qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au lieu de la p\u00e9nurie pendant un certain temps et qu'il pouvait retourner \u00e0 la maison pendant quelques jours. Il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver du 16 juin au 6 juillet, ni du 23 juillet au 8 ao\u00fbt. Il a eu un autre cong\u00e9 le 1er septembre. Sa date suivante de travail \u00e9tait le 25 septembre. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le 29 octobre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Francis, mais il n'y a r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 partir du 22 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi un employ\u00e9 serait affect\u00e9 pendant presque deux mois sans travailler, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Je ne peux pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question.\n[78] L'employ\u00e9 P a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 North Battleford le 25 f\u00e9vrier. Le 19 mars, il a pris une semaine de vacances puis il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 26 mars. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'a plus l'obligation d'aller r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Mme Storms a cependant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le fait d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 ne signifie pas qu'un employ\u00e9 travaille tous les jours. Dans le cas de l'employ\u00e9 P, par exemple, du 26 mars jusqu'\u00e0 la fin avril, il a seulement travaill\u00e9 sept jours \u00e0 son terminal local, mais Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'il faut \u00eatre prudent en examinant cette information, parce que les tours peuvent durer deux (2) ou trois (3) jours chacun, bien qu'aucune preuve confirmant que c'\u00e9tait le cas pour cet employ\u00e9 n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. L'employ\u00e9 a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied le 24 avril 2005. De cette date jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e, cet employ\u00e9 s'est d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans la zone de la Saskatchewan [TRADUCTION] occupant des postes ouverts dans d'autres terminaux.\n[79] L'expression [TRADUCTION] occuper des postes ouverts fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la situation o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied qui a de l'anciennet\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest choisit de se rendre \u00e0 un autre terminal o\u00f9 un poste qu'il peut occuper est vacant. Lorsqu'un poste devient disponible \u00e0 son terminal local, l'employ\u00e9 y retourne. Si un employ\u00e9 exerce son droit d'anciennet\u00e9 et [TRADUCTION] occupe un poste ouvert, il compte comme un employ\u00e9 qui travaille et il n'a pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie.\n[80] L'employ\u00e9 Y a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Ce jour-l\u00e0, il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9, mais selon Mme Storms, le CGE aurait communiqu\u00e9 avec lui dans les jours suivants. Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait examin\u00e9 le dossier de travail de cet employ\u00e9 et qu'il y \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] absent sans permission le 4 mars 2005. Cet employ\u00e9 a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 15 mars 2005. Le 9 avril, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied, puis, le 30 avril, il a obtenu un cong\u00e9 de son coordonnateur des trains. Ce cong\u00e9 a dur\u00e9 jusqu'au 13 mai, o\u00f9 il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied. Le 5 juin, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 jusqu'au 19 juin. Le 20 juin, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon et y a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 1er juillet, puis il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied de nouveau le 2 juillet. Le 9 juillet, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon. Le 4 novembre, il a pris cong\u00e9, puis le 13 novembre, il a commenc\u00e9 sa formation de chef de triage. Il a suivi cette formation jusqu'\u00e0 No\u00ebl, puis son nom est rest\u00e9 inscrit au tableau de service jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[81] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] louche et qu'il [TRADUCTION] se rendait indisponible. Elle ajout\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'avait pas eu besoin de se pr\u00e9senter pour la p\u00e9nurie, mais que lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied au d\u00e9but avril, il aurait d\u00fb se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, ce qu'il n'a pas fait. Lorsque l'avocat de la Compagnie lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Je n'en sais rien. Son gestionnaire [...] a peut-\u00eatre fait quelque chose. Je ne sais pas exactement pourquoi; comme je l'ai dit, je crois qu'il est simplement pass\u00e9 entre les mailles du filet. Comme il travaillait, nous n'avons \u00e9videmment pas effectu\u00e9 de suivi rapproch\u00e9 \u00e0 son sujet. Enfin, le 25 d\u00e9cembre 2005, cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon. En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 que son superviseur croyait qu'il aurait besoin de cet employ\u00e9, alors [TRADUCTION] il ne l'a pas rel\u00e2ch\u00e9.\n[82] L'employ\u00e9 U a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver au m\u00eame moment que tous les autres. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait personnellement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 et qu'il l'avait avis\u00e9e que son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait en phase terminale. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait pris la d\u00e9cision elle-m\u00eame de prolonger le temps qui lui \u00e9tait accord\u00e9 pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Cet employ\u00e9 est rest\u00e9 sur le tableau des mises \u00e0 pied jusqu'au 26 juin 2005, auquel moment il a obtenu un cong\u00e9 du coordonnateur des trains de son terminal. Le 24 juillet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local. Son p\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en octobre et il a pris un cong\u00e9 de deuil. Apr\u00e8s cela, il est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local pour le restant de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[83] L'employ\u00e9 E \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied lorsque les proc\u00e9dures de rappel ont d\u00e9but\u00e9. Au d\u00e9part, lorsque les employ\u00e9s du CGE ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec les employ\u00e9s, ils \u00e9crivaient des notes dans leurs dossiers de travail alors qu'ils effectuaient les appels. Cependant, comme la p\u00e9nurie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s importante, les proc\u00e9dures devenaient un peu maladroites et Mme Storms a avis\u00e9 ses employ\u00e9s de pr\u00e9parer des tableaux afin de voir comment les choses se d\u00e9roulaient et combien de personnes couvriraient la p\u00e9nurie. Les renseignements qui se trouvent sur ces tableaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis et inscrits par diff\u00e9rents employ\u00e9s du CGE. Le premier tableau a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit le 7 mars 2005. La derni\u00e8re entr\u00e9e datait du 19 mai 2005. Apr\u00e8s cela, la liste n'a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette date, [TRADUCTION] la plupart des 47 employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s avaient r\u00e9pondu ou leur situation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[84] L'inscription sur les feuilles de calcul pour le 16 mars 2005 indique que l'employ\u00e9 E avait [TRADUCTION] 15 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter, 30 jours demand\u00e9s. G. Spanos, confirmer ou organiser le d\u00e9placement. Le 20 avril 2005, il est inscrit [TRADUCTION] Dans la zone du Manitoba [E] a obtenu un cong\u00e9 de compassion jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre - accord\u00e9 par Ron Smith - pour des raisons personnelles [non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que Ron Smith \u00e9tait le gestionnaire du personnel des trains pour la zone du Manitoba. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle en savait un peu plus au sujet de la situation de cet employ\u00e9, parce qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 avec son superviseur apr\u00e8s l'audience de l'affaire Seeley. En r\u00e9ponse aux questions que l'avocat de la Compagnie lui a pos\u00e9es, elle a expliqu\u00e9 que la situation de l'employ\u00e9 E \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 celle de l'employ\u00e9 U. Il avait aussi un parent en phase terminale, ce qui expliquait l'inscription du 19 mai 2005, qui pr\u00e9cisait [TRADUCTION] Dans la zone du Manitoba, cette personne a obtenu un [cong\u00e9 de compassion] jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman et K. Carroll. M. Carroll \u00e9tait le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Vancouver, division sud, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, et M. Nashman \u00e9tait le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Centre d'op\u00e9ration de l'Ouest. L'employ\u00e9 E a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 jusqu'au 30 juillet 2005 et a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 absent sans permission du 31 juillet au 8 septembre. Le 10 septembre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre terminal (Brandon (Manitoba)) et, finalement, il a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 le 19 octobre.\n[85] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son superviseur avait expliqu\u00e9 que l'employ\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver parce qu'[TRADUCTION] il le formait pour qu'il devienne superviseur, mais l'employ\u00e9 a finalement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. Cette r\u00e9ponse n'est pas la m\u00eame qu'elle avait donn\u00e9e auparavant \u00e0 l'avocat de la Compagnie, auquel moment elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la situation de cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celle de l'employ\u00e9 U.\n[86] L'employ\u00e9 FG apparaissait dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Compagnie comme ayant d\u00e9missionn\u00e9, mais \u00e0 l'audience, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une erreur. Cet employ\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver et il s'y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 22 mars 2005. Cependant, de cette date jusqu'au 21 septembre 2005, l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait en [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 de maladie. Il a obtenu ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme un [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur les cong\u00e9s familiaux. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer ce qu'\u00e9tait la [TRADUCTION] Loi sur les cong\u00e9s familiaux, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne savait pas. Une recherche rapide n'a pas permis au Tribunal de trouver une loi portant le nom de [TRADUCTION] Loi sur les cong\u00e9s familiaux. Cet employ\u00e9 a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste \u00e0 la Compagnie le 6 mai 2006.\n[87] L'employ\u00e9 O appara\u00eet dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Compagnie comme s'il s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver et qu'il \u00e9tait toujours employ\u00e9 de la Compagnie. Cependant, les documents produits \u00e0 l'audience d\u00e9montrent que cet employ\u00e9 ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver. Il est rest\u00e9 dans sa province o\u00f9, selon Mme Storms, [TRADUCTION] tous les employ\u00e9s de l'endroit \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s.\n[88] L'employ\u00e9 QR couvrait une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne lorsque la proc\u00e9dure de rappel a d\u00e9but\u00e9, donc il n'avait pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 Vancouver. Lorsqu'il a eu termin\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais pendant la p\u00e9riode du 8 novembre 2005 au 20 d\u00e9cembre 2005, il a travaill\u00e9 seulement trois jours. Avant le 8 novembre, il semble qu'il a travaill\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pas commenter la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant le 8 novembre, mais elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il y avait toujours une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[89] Un autre employ\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9 M, s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 25 mars 2005, mais de cette date jusqu'\u00e0 la fin 2005, les documents indiquent qu'il n'a travaill\u00e9 que trente-quatre (34) tours. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, entre le 17 septembre et le 31 d\u00e9cembre, il n'a travaill\u00e9 que dix (10) tours. Les documents montrent que cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent tr\u00e8s souvent. Les documents indiquent aussi qu'entre le 30 novembre et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2005, cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait absent sans permission. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne connaissait pas la raison de cette absence. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que seul son superviseur pouvait donner une justification. Cet employ\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9.\n[90] L'employ\u00e9 A a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pendant environ deux (2) mois. Le 14 mai 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Kenora. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur qui avait pris la d\u00e9cision de l'affecter \u00e0 Kenora [TRADUCTION] croyait ou pr\u00e9voyait qu'il y aurait du travail \u00e0 ce terminal pour cet employ\u00e9. Cependant, les documents indiquent que du 17 mai 2005 au 4 ao\u00fbt 2005, cet employ\u00e9 a travaill\u00e9 trois (3) tours \u00e0 Kenora et que du 1er novembre jusqu'\u00e0 la fin d\u00e9cembre, il n'a travaill\u00e9 que sept (7) tours. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pr\u00e9senter de raison pour laquelle le superviseur \u00e0 Kenora avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'affecter cet employ\u00e9, mais elle a reconnu que cette [TRADUCTION] personne n'avait pas beaucoup travaill\u00e9 .\n[91] L'employ\u00e9 C s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 15 mars 2005. Il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais son nom apparaissait comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] disponible sur le tableau \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions. Le 16 mai 2005, il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Kenora. Du 17 mai au 9 juillet 2005, il a travaill\u00e9 trois (3) jours \u00e0 ce terminal et du 20 octobre au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2005, les documents indiquent qu'il n'a pas du tout travaill\u00e9. Mme Storms a confirm\u00e9 cette information dans son t\u00e9moignage.\n[92] L'employ\u00e9 DE a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 15 mars 2005. Son horaire de travail \u00e0 Vancouver a \u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t r\u00e9gulier. Le 18 juin 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Terrace, mais alors qu'il s'y trouvait, il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 avant le 23 septembre, date \u00e0 laquelle il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[93] Un autre employ\u00e9, IJ, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, mais il n'a pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver parce qu'il couvrait une p\u00e9nurie dans un autre endroit. Du 17 mars au 16 mai, alors qu'il couvrait cette p\u00e9nurie, les documents montrent qu'il n'a travaill\u00e9 qu'une (1) seule journ\u00e9e (le 26 avril 2005). Du 20 mai au 27 mai, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local \u00e0 Thunder Bay. Du 3 juin au 24 juin, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais une fois de plus, les documents montrent qu'il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 pendant plusieurs jours. Du 16 juillet au 1er septembre, il a eu un horaire de travail plut\u00f4t r\u00e9gulier. Le 7 septembre, il a quitt\u00e9 Vancouver pour se rendre \u00e0 Sioux Lookout, o\u00f9 il n'a travaill\u00e9 que quatre (4) jours jusqu'au 27 octobre 2005. Apr\u00e8s cette date, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 d'abord \u00e0 Brandon, puis \u00e0 Fort Francis.\n[94] L'employ\u00e9 O ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour diverses raisons inexpliqu\u00e9es. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, mais les documents d\u00e9montrent que pendant la p\u00e9riode allant jusqu'en d\u00e9cembre, son horaire de travail \u00e0 ce terminal \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s irr\u00e9gulier. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces renseignements [TRADUCTION] semblaient justes et elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'[TRADUCTION] il revenait au terminal de mettre \u00e0 pied cet employ\u00e9. Si le terminal l'a affect\u00e9 et qu'il n'a pas travaill\u00e9, il n'y a pas grand chose que le CGE pouvait faire.\n[95] L'employ\u00e9 W s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 14 avril 2005. De cette date jusqu'au 29 juillet, il a travaill\u00e9 dix-huit (18) jours. Le 29 juillet 2005 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sa derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver. Le 30 juillet, cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local. Il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9, mais n'a pas travaill\u00e9 du 13 ao\u00fbt au 19 septembre. Il a travaill\u00e9 le 20 septembre, mais n'a pas travaill\u00e9 par la suite avant le 12 novembre, date \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre terminal pendant sept (7) jours. Il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 19 novembre, o\u00f9 il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne savait pas pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 n'avait pas travaill\u00e9.\n[96] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9es de la Compagnie, il est indiqu\u00e9 que l'employ\u00e9 BC a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. Cependant, selon les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience, cet employ\u00e9 obtenait [TRADUCTION] des prestations d'assurance de longue dur\u00e9e - de la Great-West, compagnie d'assurance-vie. Selon Mme Storms, le r\u00e9partiteur au CGE avait probablement parl\u00e9 au superviseur de cet employ\u00e9. L'employ\u00e9 n'a pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[97] \u00c0 partir de cette preuve, le Tribunal conclut que beaucoup des employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver ne s'y sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s ou, s'ils s'y sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] disponibles pour travailler pendant divers jours, mais n'ont pas travaill\u00e9.\n(v) Le rappel au travail de la plaignante [98] Avant de traiter les faits concernant le rappel de la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver, le Tribunal note que pendant son contre-interrogatoire, Mme Storms a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas personnellement gard\u00e9 de dossier pr\u00e9cis pour la situation de la plaignante. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que Joe Lyon, le gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie au CGE pour les op\u00e9rations de l'Ouest, et aussi le gestionnaire du Groupe de rajustement des tableaux, qui se rapportait directement \u00e0 Mme Storms, auraient probablement conserv\u00e9 des documents dans le [TRADUCTION] dossier sur la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver et que les lettres de la plaignante auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 rang\u00e9es dans son dossier personnel \u00e0 la Compagnie. M. Lyon n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, alors il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible pour le Tribunal de v\u00e9rifier cette information.\n[99] Lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi les lettres de la plaignante n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es \u00e0 son dossier personnel, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu que le dossier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la num\u00e9risation et que les lettres avaient probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es du dossier \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 replac\u00e9es par la suite. Cependant, elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces lettres se trouvaient dans le dossier sur la p\u00e9nurie, dans le bureau de M. Lyon. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi ce [TRADUCTION] dossier sur la p\u00e9nurie n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle n'avait pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l'audience et qu'elle ne savait pas o\u00f9 ce dossier se trouvait. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas vu le dossier.\n[100] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9but de 2005, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 garder un il sur les tableaux du terminal de Jasper parce qu'elle \u00e9tait la chef de train qui avait le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 parmi les employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle \u00e9tait la prochaine \u00e0 \u00eatre rappel\u00e9e au travail.\n[101] Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que, comme elle avait pris des mesures pour la garde de son fils, elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s'inscrire au tableau des urgences du CGE. Elle a effectu\u00e9 son premier d\u00e9placement en r\u00e9ponse au tableau des urgences le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2005.\n[102] Le 23 ou le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2005, elle a re\u00e7u un appel du CGE. L'employ\u00e9 du CGE lui a demand\u00e9 combien de temps il lui faudrait pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail si elle \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e au tableau de service. Elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate. Cet appel lui a donn\u00e9 le sentiment qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e8s de retrouver sa carri\u00e8re sur les chemins de fer. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 avec le surintendant \u00e0 Jasper et qu'il lui avait dit qu'il y avait de plus en plus de travail et qu'elle devait mettre \u00e0 jour ses fiches de qualifications.\n[103] Le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2005, Joe Lyon lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour l'aviser qu'elle avait quinze (15) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie dans une gare de triage. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cet appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique l'a compl\u00e8tement constern\u00e9e et atterr\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Lyons quelle serait la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9nurie et qu'il lui a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle durerait un bon moment.\n[104] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont elle s'est sentie apr\u00e8s le rappel pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer les options pour son fils et elle m\u00eame. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, compte tenu des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives que la s\u00e9paration avait eue sur son fils alors qu'elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 St. Louis, elle ne croyait pas que l'option de laisser son fils \u00e0 Jasper alors qu'elle allait \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9tait viable. Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver auparavant et qu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il \u00e9tait raisonnable d'amener son fils pour qu'il habite avec elle dans les logements r\u00e9serv\u00e9s aux \u00e9quipes. De plus, il n'y avait aucune \u00e9cole \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 o\u00f9 son fils pouvait terminer la maternelle et commencer la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e du primaire \u00e0 l'automne. Elle ne savait pas si elle aurait des services de garde parce qu'elle n'avait pas de famille \u00e0 Vancouver qui pouvait l'aider.\n[105] En contre-interrogatoire, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait beaucoup discut\u00e9 avec le p\u00e8re de son fils au sujet des diverses possibilit\u00e9s, bien qu'elle n'ait pas pu se souvenir s'ils avaient discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il assure la r\u00e9sidence principale de leur fils pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a cependant ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas d'avis qu'il s'agissait d'une solution viable, compte tenu de la nature du travail du p\u00e8re.\n[106] La plaignante a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son premier choix \u00e9tait de rester \u00e0 Jasper et de travailler en fonction du tableau des urgences jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un poste s'ouvre au terminal. Subsidiairement, elle aurait accept\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en cong\u00e9, toujours au terminal de Jasper. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00eate \u00e0 discuter avec CN afin de trouver d'autres options viables, mais que cela ne s'est jamais produit.\n[107] La plaignante \u00e9tait aussi tr\u00e8s inqui\u00e8te au sujet de la sant\u00e9 de son fils. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que la qu\u00eate pour obtenir un diagnostic de la maladie de son fils avait d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 2004 aupr\u00e8s de son m\u00e9decin de famille. Elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'obtenir des rendez-vous avec des sp\u00e9cialistes pour son fils au printemps et \u00e0 l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2005.\n[108] Elle a demand\u00e9 l'avis de son syndicat et, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse, elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Colin Pizziol, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper, le 9 mars 2005, pour demander une prorogation de 30 jours du d\u00e9lai pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, en application de la clause 115 de la convention collective. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que cette demande semblait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, mais que personne ne lui a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 pour l'aviser de la d\u00e9cision. Elle avait maintenant jusqu'au 26 mars 2005 pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[109] Le 14 mars 2005, elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Rob Thompson, qui \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident local du syndicat \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, pour lui donner des d\u00e9tails au sujet du rendez-vous avec un sp\u00e9cialiste qu'elle avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 obtenir pour son fils en avril 2005. La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle s'attendait \u00e0 ce que le syndicat fasse parvenir ce renseignement \u00e0 la Compagnie, mais Joe Torchia, le directeur des relations de travail de la Compagnie, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas du tout au courant de cette lettre.\n[110] La plaignante a ensuite examin\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait en mesure de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en d\u00e9tails au sujet de la nature de son analyse. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point elle avait aim\u00e9 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries dans le pass\u00e9 et \u00e0 quel point elle souhaitait reprendre sa carri\u00e8re dans le domaine des chemins de fer. Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 comment son fils avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par son absence lorsqu'elle avait r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 St. Louis et comment il \u00e9tait encore affect\u00e9 \u00e0 ce jour. Elle a soulign\u00e9 tous les facteurs dont elle avait tenu compte, y compris le fait que le p\u00e8re de son fils n'accepterait pas qu'elle quitte Jasper avec son fils et le fait que, compte tenu de son travail saisonnier, il n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de l'accompagner \u00e0 Vancouver pour s'occuper de son fils. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle aurait [TRADUCTION] ador\u00e9 aller \u00e0 Vancouver, mais que sa situation avec son fils ne lui permettait pas de le faire. La plaignante a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de son fils et des mesures qu'elle avait prises afin qu'il obtienne un diagnostic convenable et un traitement appropri\u00e9.\n[111] Le 18 mars 2005, suivant les conseils de son syndicat, la plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Joe Torchia. Dans cette lettre, elle a expliqu\u00e9 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail et sa situation de famille. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 Jasper, elle avait du soutient et elle avait pris des mesures afin de satisfaire \u00e0 toutes ses obligations parentales tout en travaillant comme chef de train. Elle a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] [...] aller travailler \u00e0 Vancouver sans mon fils serait inacceptable. Il m'est impossible d'amener mon fils avec moi. Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Mon affectation ici \u00e0 Jasper n'est qu'une question de temps, j'ai m\u00eame effectu\u00e9 un quart de travail d'urgence ici le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Je suis l'employ\u00e9e en mise \u00e0 pied qui a le plus d'anciennet\u00e9. Elle a conclu en \u00e9crivant : [TRADUCTION] Je vous demande de faire preuve de compassion et de compr\u00e9hension; veuillez m'exempter du rappel \u00e0 Vancouver. Permettez-moi de tenir ma promesse envers mon fils, s'il-vous-pla\u00eet permettez-moi de rester \u00e0 Jasper.\n[112] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait lu cette lettre et qu'il avait communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Storms au CGE \u00e0 ce sujet. Il a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 qu'il y avait plus d'une demande de la m\u00eame nature. Il a donn\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s du CGE la consigne d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver compte tenu du fait qu'elle avait [TRADUCTION] quelques probl\u00e8mes et qu'elle avait besoin de plus de temps pour [TRADUCTION] r\u00e9gler sa situation. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir lu la lettre, il \u00e9tait d'avis que c'\u00e9tait la chose \u00e0 faire.\n[113] M. Torchia a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait avis\u00e9 Mme Storms d'accorder la m\u00eame prorogation de d\u00e9lai \u00e0 Cindy Richards et \u00e0 Denise Seeley, puisque leurs situations \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s semblables \u00e0 celle de la plaignante. M. Torchia a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre ni parl\u00e9 directement \u00e0 la plaignante parce qu'il lui avait donn\u00e9 ce dont elle avait besoin : plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. En contre-interrogatoire, il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait sous l'impression que le CGE aviserait les trois employ\u00e9s de la prorogation qui leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[114] Il a expliqu\u00e9 que vers le m\u00eame moment, il a re\u00e7u un appel de Bryan Boechler, le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du syndicat, au sujet de ces trois employ\u00e9es. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Boechler lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que ces employ\u00e9es avaient des probl\u00e8mes de [TRADUCTION] garde d'enfants et qu'il avait demand\u00e9 qu'on leur accorde plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il croyait qu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, une prorogation avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[115] Les feuilles de calcul pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par le CGE au sujet du rappel n'appuient pas le t\u00e9moignage de M. Torchia. Sur la feuille dat\u00e9e du [TRADUCTION] 18 mars 2005 \u00e0 13 h, une note dans la colonne de la plaignante pr\u00e9cise : [TRADUCTION] 15 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter, 30 jours demand\u00e9s - OK en date du 6 avril, accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman. Le Tribunal note aussi que la note dans la colonne de D. Seeley indiquait : [TRADUCTION] 16 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter, 30 jours demand\u00e9s - OK en date du 6 avril, accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman et dans la colonne de C. Richards, la note pr\u00e9cisait : [TRADUCTION] Message laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence pour qu'elle effectue son examen m\u00e9dical - demande 15 jours . Il semble donc que la prorogation du d\u00e9lai a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par M. Nashman et non par M. Torchia. Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 avec M. Torchia \u00e0 quelques reprises, mais elle ne se souvient pas exactement ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit.\n[116] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, le 30 avril 2005, elle a re\u00e7u une lettre dat\u00e9e du 25 avril et sign\u00e9e par M. Lyon. Dans cette lettre, M. Lyon \u00e9crivait : [TRADUCTION] La Compagnie a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour vous en vous donnant plus de temps pour examiner vos options et pour prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires quant \u00e0 la garde de votre enfant [...] La Compagnie ne peut pas vous accorder plus de temps pour vous pr\u00e9senter [\u00e0 Vancouver]. Vous devez nous donner d'ici le 6 mai 2005 une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 savoir si vous vous pr\u00e9senterez \u00e0 Vancouver ou non. Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u cette lettre, la plaignante soutient qu'elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Lyon pour lui demander s'il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Torchia. M. Lyon lui a dit que ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas.\n[117] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas particip\u00e9 directement \u00e0 l'\u00e9bauche de la lettre du 25 avril 2005, qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant une [TRADUCTION] lettre type, mais elle est certaine que M. Lyon aurait discut\u00e9 avec elle au sujet de son contenu. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 avec M. Torchia \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et qu'il lui avait dit de [TRADUCTION] mettre \u00e7a sur la glace pour l'instant et [de leur donner] juste un peu plus de temps.\n[118] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle croyait qu'il y avait un [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8me de communication alors elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00e9crire \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 M. Torchia le 30 avril 2005. Dans cette lettre, elle a mentionn\u00e9 une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elle avait eu le jour-m\u00eame avec son superviseur, Colin Pizziol. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, il lui avait dit qu'il avait discut\u00e9 avec Kirk Carroll, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Compagnie \u00e0 Vancouver, et avec M. Torchia. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 que bien que la Compagnie \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] sensible \u00e0 la situation de la plaignante, cette derni\u00e8re devait donner une date raisonnable \u00e0 laquelle elle se pr\u00e9senterait \u00e0 Vancouver. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] la question \u00e9tait hors de son contr\u00f4le. La plaignante a avis\u00e9 M. Torchia des rendez-vous m\u00e9dicaux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vus pour son fils et a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] La semaine a \u00e9t\u00e9 p\u00e9nible, M. Torchia. Je ne vous raconterai m\u00eame pas les trois heures que nous avons pass\u00e9es au Hinton General Hospital... Elle a conclu sa lettre en \u00e9crivant : [TRADUCTION] J'aimerais vous rencontrer lorsque je me rendrai \u00e0 Edmonton en mai. J'aimerais discuter d'autres choses avec vous, mais je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re ne pas aborder la question par \u00e9crit.\n[119] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u la lettre de la plaignante le 30 avril. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait pas avoir discut\u00e9 avec M. Pizziol et M. Carroll, bien qu'il ne conteste pas le fait que ces conversations aienteu lieu. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir lu la lettre, il en est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion que la plaignante avait besoin de plus de temps pour s'organiser et il a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Storms pour lui demander d'accorder plus de temps \u00e0 la plaignante. Il n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre.\n[120] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Torchia au sujet du fait qu'il a discut\u00e9 avec Mme Storms correspond aux renseignements inscrits sur les feuilles de calcul du CGE. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 deux autres femmes une prorogation de 30 jours. Les notes sur les feuilles de calcul du [TRADUCTION] 2 mai 2005 \u00e0 17 h, du [TRADUCTION] 19 mai 2005 \u00e0 10 h 30 et du [TRADUCTION] 19 mai 2005 \u00e0 17 h sont les m\u00eames pour les trois femmes : [TRADUCTION] Garde d'enfants - temporairement en attente conform\u00e9ment aux consignes de Joe Torchia. Mme Storms ne se souvenait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment du contenu de ses discussions avec M. Torchia.\n[121] La plaignante a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 un moment au printemps 2005, elle a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Torchia et lui a laiss\u00e9 un message dans lequel elle demandait \u00e0 le rencontrer. Il n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ce message. M. Torchia ne se souvient pas du tout de cet appel, mais il ne nie pas le fait que ce soit arriv\u00e9. En contre-interrogatoire, il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne rencontrait pas normalement les employ\u00e9s et qu'il traitait plut\u00f4t avec le syndicat.\n[122] Selon M. Torchia, il est inhabituel que ce genre de questions lui soient envoy\u00e9es directement. Il a ajout\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s qui avaient de telles demandes les pr\u00e9sentaient normalement \u00e0 leur superviseur. Le superviseur traite ces demandes directement et elles sont rarement transf\u00e9r\u00e9es [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 son niveau. Cependant, en contre-interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que m\u00eame si la plaignante avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande \u00e0 son superviseur, le r\u00e9sultat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame, parce que le superviseur aurait d\u00fb obtenir l'approbation de M. Morris ou de lui-m\u00eame.\n[123] Comme M. Torchia n'a pas recommuniqu\u00e9 avec elle et comme le CGE l'avait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre un tour d'urgence, la plaignante a suppos\u00e9 que sa suggestion de rester \u00e0 Jasper et de travailler sur le tableau des urgences avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e.\n[124] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant la derni\u00e8re semaine de mai ou au d\u00e9but de juin 2005, il participait \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec Albert Nashman et Bryan Boechler, le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Syndicat. Bien que la r\u00e9union ait port\u00e9 sur d'autres questions, \u00e0 un certain moment, M. Boechler a demand\u00e9 une autre prorogation pour la plaignante et les deux autres employ\u00e9es. Selon M. Torchia, M. Nashman et lui m\u00eame ont accord\u00e9 une autre prorogation jusqu'au 2 juillet 2005. Selon ce que M. Torchia avait compris, il \u00e9tait clair qu'il s'agissait de la derni\u00e8re prorogation qui serait accord\u00e9e. En contre-interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas si cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante. Il a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait [TRADUCTION] pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante en lui accordant plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la possibilit\u00e9 d'accorder un [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 de compassion ne lui avait jamais travers\u00e9 l'esprit et qu'\u00e0 son avis, ce n'est pas ce que la plaignante demandait, bien qu'il ait admis qu'il ne lui avait jamais parl\u00e9.\n[125] Il a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu'un [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 \u00e9tait normalement accord\u00e9 pour des raisons [TRADUCTION] opportunes quant aux exigences op\u00e9rationnelles de la Compagnie. Cependant, il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas que certains employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver avaient obtenu des cong\u00e9s accord\u00e9s par leurs superviseurs.\n[126] Le 22 juin 2005, la plaignante a re\u00e7u un appel de Mme Storms. Mme Storms l'a avis\u00e9e qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver le 2 juillet sinon elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Storms si elle \u00e9tait au courant de sa situation, et Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] non.\n[127] Le 22 ou le 23 juin 2005, dans un courriel de r\u00e9ponse au courriel de Mme Storms r\u00e9capitulant la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec la plaignante, M. Torchia a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] \u00c0 mon avis elles [la plaignante et les deux autres femmes] ont obtenu suffisamment de temps pour organiser leurs affaires personnelles. Si elles souhaitent obtenir plus de temps, elles devront s'organiser avec leur superviseur. Brian Kalin, qui \u00e9tait le superviseur de M. Pizziol, a \u00e9crit le m\u00eame jour : [TRADUCTION] Il n'y aura pas d'autre prorogation. Je suis d'accord avec Joe - elles ont eu plusieurs mois pour s'organiser. Il est temps qu'elles prennent une d\u00e9cision. Brian Kalin n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, le Tribunal n'a donc aucun d\u00e9tail au sujet de ce qu'il connaissait de la situation de la plaignante. De plus, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que quelqu'un \u00e0 la Compagnie a avis\u00e9 la plaignante qu'elle devait traiter avec son superviseur imm\u00e9diat, M. Pizziol, au sujet de sa demande d'exemption quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver.\n[128] Il convient aussi de mentionner que dans l'ensemble des courriels que la Compagnie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience se trouve un courriel qui, selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Torchia, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par Albert Nashman. M. Torchia a ajout\u00e9 que le courriel avait possiblement \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9 d'un autre courriel, mais il n'en \u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr. Il ne pouvait pas non plus pr\u00e9ciser la date de ce courriel. Le courriel se lisait comme suit : [TRADUCTION] J'ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Boechler hier soir. Je lui ai dit qu'on ne continuerait pas \u00e0 retarder le processus. Elles ont l'obligation, en fonction de la convention collective, de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 ce qu'on devait r\u00e9pondre au prochain groupe qui dirait qu'il ne veut pas aller \u00e0 Vancouver. S'il veut d\u00e9poser un grief, qu'il le fasse.\n[129] Le contenu de ce courriel ne semble pas correspondre au t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de M. Torchia au sujet du fait qu'il avait pris la d\u00e9cision qu'aucune autre prorogation ne serait accord\u00e9e pendant la r\u00e9union avec M. Nashman et M. Boechler \u00e0 la fin mai ou dans la premi\u00e8re semaine de juin. Pourtant, ce courriel semble laisser entendre que c'est M. Nashman qui a pris cette d\u00e9cision.\n[130] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] stress\u00e9e et tr\u00e8s nerveuse. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle perdait rapidement confiance. Elle ne pouvait pas croire qu'elle [TRADUCTION] n'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment importante pour que quelqu'un lui r\u00e9ponde. Le 23 juin 2005, la plaignante a de nouveau \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia. Dans cette lettre, elle a expliqu\u00e9 tant l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 particulier de son fils que le travail utile qu'elle avait effectu\u00e9 pour la Compagnie \u00e0 Jasper. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle esp\u00e9rait que [TRADUCTION] cette lettre sauverait [son] emploi. M. Torchia n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plaignante avait obtenu une prorogation de d\u00e9lai de quatre (4) mois [TRADUCTION] pour r\u00e9gler sa situation et c'est tout ce que nous \u00e9tions pr\u00eats \u00e0 lui accorder.\n[131] Le 27 juin 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e dans une lettre de L. Gallegos, gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations au CGE, qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver au plus tard le 2 juillet 2005. Elle a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e que si elle ne s'y pr\u00e9sentait pas, elle renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9 et son poste au sein de la Compagnie serait aboli. Cette lettre mentionnait aussi une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 22 juin 2005 entre la plaignante et Mme Storms. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u cette lettre, elle avait pleur\u00e9 et [TRADUCTION] paniqu\u00e9. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] sous le choc et effray\u00e9e. Elle ne pouvait pas croire ce qui se passait.\n[132] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle se souvenait de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 22 juin, mais qu'elle ne se souvenait pas de la discussion pr\u00e9cise. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plaignante avait expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait des [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8mes de garde d'enfant. Mme Storms se souvient lui avoir dit que la Compagnie avait tout de m\u00eame besoin qu'elle r\u00e9ponde \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait compris que la plaignante lui avait dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Elle ne se souvient pas si la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 de prendre des mesures sp\u00e9ciales, mais elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, si la plaignante l'avait fait, elle lui aurait dit d'en parler \u00e0 son superviseur et \u00e0 son repr\u00e9sentant syndical.\n[133] Le 30 juin 2005, la plaignante a envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Peter Marshall, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral adjoint de la Compagnie pour la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Dans cette lettre, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle croyait qu'on lui avait accord\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] un cong\u00e9 de compassion pour [..] rester \u00e0 Jasper et r\u00e9pondre au tableau des urgences. Elle a fait parvenir \u00e0 M. Marshall tous ses \u00e9changes de lettres avec les autres gestionnaires et elle a ajout\u00e9 que sa lettre \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] un plaidoyer d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9 pour sauver son emploi. M. Marshall n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette lettre.\n[134] Le 4 juillet 2005, la Compagnie a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa pr\u00e9sente lettre confirme, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 115 et \u00e0 la clause 148 de la convention collective 4.3, que vous avez renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 vos droits d'anciennet\u00e9 et que vos services ne sont plus requis par la compagnie. Votre dossier d'emploi est maintenant ferm\u00e9.\n[135] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u cette lettre, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 compl\u00e8tement [TRADUCTION] abattue. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s offens\u00e9e qu'on puisse croire que sa situation n'\u00e9tait qu'une question de [TRADUCTION] choix personnel.\n[136] Apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 au Syndicat de d\u00e9poser un grief en son nom. Le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et, le 12 avril 2006, l'arbitre Picher a rendu sa d\u00e9cision arbitrale, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e au Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer canadiens (le Bureau), dossier no 3549. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, l'arbitre d\u00e9clare, entre autres\n[TRADUCTION]\nDans le pr\u00e9sent grief, le Syndicat ne soutient pas qu'il y avait une obligation d'accommodement envers la plaignante au sens des dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ou de toute autre loi. Il soutient plut\u00f4t que la Compagnie a d\u00e9raisonnablement omis d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante un cong\u00e9 pour lui permettre d'\u00e9viter le rappel \u00e0 Vancouver en raison de sa situation personnelle.\n[...]\nApr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 un examen attentif des faits, l'arbitre a beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter l'all\u00e9gation du Syndicat. Premi\u00e8rement, je suis d'accord avec la Compagnie au sujet du fait que la plaignante n'a pas demand\u00e9 de cong\u00e9. Ce qu'elle demandait \u00e9tait une forme de super anciennet\u00e9 qui lui permettrait, contrairement aux autres employ\u00e9s, de rester en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 Jasper, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries ailleurs, tout en continuant de recevoir des appels p\u00e9riodiques pour travailler en fonction de la liste d'urgence \u00e0 Jasper, comme elle l'a fait auparavant. Un cong\u00e9 sous-entend le d\u00e9part du lieu de travail, virtuellement pour n'importe quelle raison, que ce soit pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie ou pour une p\u00e9riode fixe. Ce ne sont pas les options que Mme Whyte a demand\u00e9es... La plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce ne demandait pas un rajustement ou un accommodement de son horaire de travail. Elle demandait plut\u00f4t une exemption de l'une des obligations les plus fondamentales de la convention collective, c'est-\u00e0-dire l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie dans son territoire d'anciennet\u00e9 lorsqu'il manque d'employ\u00e9s dans un lieu.\n[...]\nJ'aurais de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que la Compagnie a d\u00e9raisonnablement ou arbitrairement refus\u00e9 d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une modification aux obligations stipul\u00e9es dans sa convention collective, modification qui pourrait durer ind\u00e9finiment, peut-\u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 dix ans, alors qu'elle continuerait \u00e0 jouir d'un statut sp\u00e9cial prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9e qui ne peut \u00eatre forc\u00e9e de travailler qu'\u00e0 Jasper.\n[...]\nLe pr\u00e9sent grief fait ressortir ce qui doit \u00eatre reconnu comme une constante dans toute relation d'emploi, c'est-\u00e0-dire la tension entre les obligations personnelles et familiales et les obligations envers l'employeur. De nombreuses circonstances peuvent avoir un effet sur les obligations personnelles ou familiales d'un employ\u00e9 : le soin d'un enfant, le soin d'un parent \u00e2g\u00e9 ou de tout autre parent proche, ou le soin d'un conjoint atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience m\u00e9dicale importante. D'autres situations personnelles peuvent comprendre des obligations de libert\u00e9 conditionnelle ou de service communautaire apr\u00e8s l'imposition d'une peine, la participation active \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise ou \u00e0 un groupe social, le b\u00e9n\u00e9volat ou les activit\u00e9s sportives comp\u00e9titives, pour n'en nommer que quelques-unes.\nUne compagnie de chemins de fer est, de nature, une entreprise qui fonctionne vingt-quatre heures par jour, sept jours par semaine. Les personnes embauch\u00e9es pour travailler, en particulier le personnel des trains, savent ou devraient raisonnablement savoir que leurs heures de travail seront irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res et qu'\u00e0 l'occasion, elles auront l'obligation de changer de lieu pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie au besoin. En \u00e9change pour leur acceptation de ces lourdes obligations, les employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie de chemins de fer ont obtenu l'avantage de salaires relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et de bons avantages sociaux.\nPour quelle raison un conseil d'arbitrage, responsable de l'interpr\u00e9tation et de l'application des clauses de la convention collective, pourrait-il conclure que la situation d'un parent seul peut r\u00e9ellement \u00e9clipser les obligations d'emploi n\u00e9goci\u00e9es par les parties dans les clauses de la convention collective? Dans un monde o\u00f9 le fait d'\u00eatre parent seul est commun, cela n'est pas une question n\u00e9gligeable. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les conseils d'arbitrage, dont le pr\u00e9sent Bureau, ont confirm\u00e9 qu'en ce qui a trait aux questions de garde d'enfants, le fardeau revient \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9, et non \u00e0 l'employeur, de garantir que les obligations familiales n'interf\u00e8rent pas avec les obligations de base d'un contrat d'emploi.\nBien entendu, il revient aux parties de n\u00e9gocier le libell\u00e9 de leur convention collective afin de pr\u00e9voir une exemption possible des obligations d'emploi qui s'appliqueraient autrement aux parents uniques, ou m\u00eame aux parents mari\u00e9s qui ont des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux. Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les l\u00e9gislateurs, tant f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que provinciaux, pourraient promulguer des lois claires qui obligent les employeurs \u00e0 tenir compte de tels facteurs dans l'administration des contrats d'emploi et des conventions collectives. Cependant, compte tenu de l'\u00e9tat des choses, l'arbitre ne peut relever aucune pratique discriminatoire dans la politique de la Compagnie. La politique exige pour l'essentiel que tous les parents, qu'ils soient c\u00e9libataires ou mari\u00e9s, r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 leurs obligations de base d'emploi peu importe leur situation personnelle ou familiale. Bien entendu, il arrive, comme c'est le cas pour la plaignante, que des prorogations de d\u00e9lai et d'autres accommodements soient accord\u00e9s lorsque l'employ\u00e9 d\u00e9montre que sa situation personnelle est difficile. Toutefois, en bout de ligne, tous les employ\u00e9s qui ont des obligations parentales sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, sans discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. \u00c0 mon avis, il serait tout \u00e0 fait inappropri\u00e9, alors que ni les parties, ni les l\u00e9gislateurs n'ont adopt\u00e9 de telle protection, qu'un arbitre extrapole, \u00e0 partir d'une stipulation telle que la clause 115.4 et de l'expression raisons satisfaisantes de ne pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un rappel, une annulation r\u00e9elle de l'obligation la plus fondamentale d'un employ\u00e9 envers sa convention collective d'\u00eatre au travail, d'une fa\u00e7on qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 accorder une forme de super anciennet\u00e9. Si ni les parties elles-m\u00eames, ni les l\u00e9gislateurs n'ont labour\u00e9 un tel nouveau sillon, il ne revient \u00e9videmment pas \u00e0 l'arbitre de le faire, puisqu'il est tenu, comme tout conseil d'arbitrage, d'appliquer la convention collective comme elle est \u00e9crite. Il revient aux parties de n\u00e9gocier ce qui deviendrait un cong\u00e9 parental ind\u00e9fini ou partiel, ou aux l\u00e9gislateurs comp\u00e9tents de le faire, si cela est appropri\u00e9 ou d\u00e9sirable.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[137] \u00c0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Picher, le Tribunal ne peut que r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ce qu'il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, 2010 TCDP 20, au sujet de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[227] Dans Whyte, l'employ\u00e9 avait enti\u00e8rement le fardeau de s'adapter \u00e0 tout besoin associ\u00e9 avec le fait de travailler pour une compagnie qui fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, telle qu'une compagnie de chemins de fer. La d\u00e9cision concluait que [TRADUCTION] en \u00e9change pour leur acceptation de ces lourdes obligations, les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie de chemins de fer ont obtenu l'avantage de salaires relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et de bons avantages sociaux. Cela laisse entendre que l'employeur peut agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire, tant qu'il paie bien ses employ\u00e9s, sans d\u00e9finition de ce que signifie relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux ou sans comparaison.\n[138] Le 27 mars 2006, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 la CCDP.\nB. LA QUESTION EN LITIGE [139] La question soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce est la suivante : la Compagnie a-t-elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers la plaignante en cours d'emploi, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP, en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de sa situation de famille?\nC. C. LE DROIT ET LA TH\u00c8SE EN L'ESP\u00c8CE (i) Les dispositions pertinentes de la LCDP [140] L'article 3 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que la situation de famille est un motif de distinction illicite.\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[141] L'article 7 est \u00e9crit comme suit :\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, l'association patronale or l'organisation syndicale;\nde fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite; de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\nto establish or pursue a policy or practice, or to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[142] Lors de l'examen des articles 7 et 10, il est important que le Tribunal souligne l'objet de la LCDP tel qu'il est \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'article 2 :\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de completer la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n(ii) Le droit a) La preuve prima facie [143] Le fardeau initial revient \u00e0 la plaignante, qui doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille. Une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. (Voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons - Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558.)\n[144] Lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il a droit \u00e0 un redressement en l'absence d'une justification de la partie intim\u00e9e. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208.) Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la plaignante doit, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tablir qu'elle a subi une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP.\nb) Quelle approche doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille? [145] L'\u00e9valuation de l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille doit suivre les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l'arr\u00eat Public Service Labour Relations Commission c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), tout comme tout autre motif de distinction illicite. Cependant, dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, l'interpr\u00e9tation de la notion de situation de famille a entra\u00een\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation de deux \u00e9coles de pens\u00e9es distinctes. Dans certains cas, on a adopt\u00e9 une approche large pour la port\u00e9e de la situation de famille, alors que d'autres ont suivi une approche plus restreinte. Afin de mieux comprendre ce qui est inclus dans la notion de situation de famille, j'examinerai un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions.\n[146] Dans la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), [1988] D.C.D.P. no 4, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si des relations form\u00e9es par une union de fait, par opposition \u00e0 celles form\u00e9es par un mariage l\u00e9gal, relevaient des groupes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de l' \u00e9tat matrimonial et de la situation de famille. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il devait exister un lien du sang ou un lien l\u00e9gal et il a d\u00e9fini la situation de famille comme comprenant tant les liens du sang entre le parent et l'enfant que la relation qui d\u00e9coule des liens du mariage, de la consanguinit\u00e9 ou de l'adoption l\u00e9gale, y compris, bien entendu, la relation ancestrale, qu'elle soit l\u00e9gitime, ill\u00e9gitime ou par adoption, ainsi que les liens entre les \u00e9poux, les fr\u00e8res et surs, la belle-famille, les oncles ou les tantes et les neveux ou les ni\u00e8ces. Dans la d\u00e9cision Lang c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'Immigration), [1990] D.C.D.P. no 8, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 3 : Dans l'opinion du Tribunal, l'expression situation de famille comprend la relation parent-enfant.\n[147] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brown c. Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Douanes et accise), (1993) T.D. 7\/93, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux pages 14 et 18 :\nDans le cas du motif b) [la situation de famille], la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res.\n[...]\nL'avocate de la plaignante ne pr\u00e9tend pas que l'employeur est responsable des soins et de l'\u00e9ducation des enfants. Elle soutient cependant qu'il faut reconna\u00eetre, dans le contexte de la situation de famille, l'existence d'un \u00e9quilibre entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les obligations d\u00e9coulant de l'article 2 et du paragraphe 7b) de la LCDP.\nUn parent doit donc \u00e9valuer avec soin comment il peut le mieux s'acquitter de ses obligations ainsi que de ses devoirs au sein de la famille. \u00c0 cette fin, il doit demander \u00e0 l'employeur de l'aider pour qu'il r\u00e9ponde le mieux possible \u00e0 ces besoins.\nIl est donc facile de comprendre le dilemme \u00e9vident auquel la famille moderne est confront\u00e9e. En effet, selon la tendance socio-\u00e9conomique actuelle, les deux parents travaillent et sont souvent assujettis \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles et \u00e0 des exigences diff\u00e9rentes. Plus souvent qu'autrement, en raison des demandes qui lui sont impos\u00e9es comme parent, la m\u00e8re doit chercher \u00e0 atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre d\u00e9licat entre les besoins de la famille et les exigences li\u00e9es \u00e0 son travail.\n[148] Le Tribunal a enfin conclu que l'interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique qui doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la LCDP servait d'indication claire que dans le contexte de la situation de famille, le parent a le droit et l'obligation d'\u00e9tablir cet \u00e9quilibre, et l'employeur a l'obligation claire de faciliter et d'accommoder cet \u00e9quilibre en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu' [u]ne interpr\u00e9tation moins s\u00e9rieuse des probl\u00e8mes auxquels la famille moderne fait face dans le milieu de travail enl\u00e8verait tout son sens au concept de la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination.\n[149] Le Tribunal a aussi examin\u00e9 la situation de famille comme motif de distinction illicite dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2006] D.C.D.P. no 33. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition judiciaire de l'expression situation de famille, ainsi que des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal qui pr\u00e9cisaient les exigences pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif. Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\n117 La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie par la jurisprudence comme s'entendant de [...] mesures ou d'attitudes qui ont pour effet de limiter les conditions d'embauche ou les perspectives d'emploi des employ\u00e9s sur la base d'une caract\u00e9ristique li\u00e9e \u00e0 leur [...] famille (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. M. A et al, [2000] O.J. no 4275 (C.A.); confirm\u00e9 par [2002] A.C.S. no 67].\n118 Dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'affaire Ontario, mais clairement conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition qu'on y retrouve, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les exigences en mati\u00e8re de preuve qui permettent d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie :\n[...] la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res (Brown c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national, Douanes et Accise), [1993] D.C.D.P. no 7, \u00e0 la page 13). (Voir \u00e9galement Woiden et al c. Dan Lynn, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 18, T.D. 09\/02.)\n[150] Cependant, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une version diff\u00e9rente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, dans l'arr\u00eat Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia c. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. no 922, aux paragraphes 38 et 39 (Campbell River), une d\u00e9cision sur laquelle la Compagnie s'est fortement appuy\u00e9e dans ses conclusions finales. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les param\u00e8tres de la situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de distinction illicite dans le Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on trop large, sinon cela pourrait causer [TRADUCTION] de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux en milieu de travail. La Cour a expliqu\u00e9 qu'une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie [TRADUCTION] lorsqu'un changement dans une condition d'emploi impos\u00e9e par l'employeur entra\u00eene une atteinte grave envers une obligation ou un devoir parental important, ou une obligation ou un devoir familial, de l'employ\u00e9. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Le juge Low a observ\u00e9 qu'il serait difficile d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie dans les cas de conflit entre les exigences du travail et les obligations familiales.\n[151] Dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, le Tribunal n'a pas suivi l'approche pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sa position au sujet de cette d\u00e9cision comme suit :\n120 Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'analyse de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie Britannique. Les codes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, en raison de leur statut de loi fondamentale, doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale afin qu'ils puissent mieux r\u00e9aliser leurs objectifs (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 547, Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, aux pages 1134 \u00e0 1136; Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, aux pages 89 et 90). Il serait, \u00e0 mon avis, inappropri\u00e9 de choisir un motif de distinction illicite et de lui donner une d\u00e9finition plus restrictive.\n121 \u00c0 mon humble avis, les pr\u00e9occupations d\u00e9finies par la Cour d'appel, \u00e0 savoir la perturbation grave et les torts s\u00e9rieux sur le lieu de travail, peuvent \u00eatre des questions appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 examiner suivant l'analyse de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, et en particulier suivant le troisi\u00e8me volet de l'analyse, \u00e0 savoir la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 raisonnable. Dans le contexte de l'\u00e9valuation de l'importance de la contrainte, il se peut qu'une mesure d'accommodement donne lieu \u00e0 des questions comme la perturbation grave sur le lieu de travail et l'effet grave sur le moral des employ\u00e9s, qui sont des facteurs appropri\u00e9s (voir l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521). Il appartient \u00e0 l'employeur d'\u00e9tablir au cas par cas l'existence d'une contrainte excessive. Une simple crainte que la mesure d'accommodement entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive n'est pas un motif appropri\u00e9, \u00e0 mon humble avis, pour \u00e9carter l'analyse. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[152] En plus de la logique convaincante de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt du Tribunal pour ne pas suivre l'approche de Campbell River, le Tribunal conclut que l'approche sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e dans cet arr\u00eat impose un fardeau additionnel au plaignant en sous-entendant que la situation de famille, qui est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, n\u00e9cessite la preuve d'une [TRADUCTION] atteinte grave envers une obligation ou un devoir parental ou familial et que cela ne correspond pas \u00e0 l'objet de la LCDP. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [2002] 3 R.C.S. 403, au paragraphe 56, il n'est pas appropri\u00e9, lors de l'interpr\u00e9tation de lois sur les droits de la personne, d'imposer des fardeaux additionnels.\n[153] L'approche du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. no 43, aux paragraphes 29 et 30. Il s'agissait d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Johnstone \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision de la CCDP de ne pas renvoyer au Tribunal sa plainte dans laquelle elle soutenait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille.\n[154] Dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accept\u00e9 l'approche du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [...] rien ne justifie clairement qu'il faille consid\u00e9rer ce type de discrimination comme secondaire ou moins important. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29). La Cour a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la suggestion de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River selon laquelle une discrimination prima facie n'existe que lorsque l'employeur change les conditions d'emploi semble inapplicable et, \u00e0 mon humble avis, erron\u00e9e en droit. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29.) La Cour a aussi conclu que la CCDP, en adoptant le crit\u00e8re de l'atteinte grave lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal, a aussi omis de se conformer aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents permettant clairement d'\u00e9tablir s'il y a discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30.)\n[155] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Johnstone a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, bien que la Cour d'appel e\u00fbt pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'exprimait pas d'opinion sur la version appropri\u00e9e du crit\u00e8re portant sur l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 son raisonnement sur la conclusion que le d\u00e9faut de la CCDP de cibler clairement le crit\u00e8re qu'elle avait appliqu\u00e9 constituait un fondement suffisant pour conclure que la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. ([2008] A.C.F. no 427, au paragraphe 2).\n[156] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Johnstone (voir Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, 2010 TCDP 20). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu :\n[220] Le Tribunal accepte que ce ne sont pas toutes les tensions qui ont lieu dans le contexte de l'\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie-personnelle qui peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es par la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, mais ce n'est pas l'argument qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'argument de Mme Johnstone est qu'une telle protection devrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e lorsque appropri\u00e9e et raisonnable, compte tenu des circonstances pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[221] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, nous traitons ici du cas d'une vraie personne qui a des obligations envers ses jeunes enfants et des r\u00e9percussions importantes sur la capacit\u00e9 de cette personne de remplir cette obligation. Il ne revient pas au Tribunal de traiter de toutes les obligations familiales et de tous les conflits entre le travail d'un employ\u00e9 et ses obligations.\n[...]\n[230] [...] le Tribunal conclut que rien dans l'article 2 ne cr\u00e9e une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive et \u00e9troite de la situation de famille.\n[231] Au contraire, l'objectif sous-jacent de la LCDP, comme je l'ai dit, est de fournir \u00e0 toute personne un m\u00e9canisme garantissant le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins [...]. Il est raisonnable que les protections fournies comprennent celles d\u00e9coulant naturellement de l'une des relations les plus fondamentales de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui existent, celles du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re envers son enfant. Le fait que le libell\u00e9 de l'article 2 mentionne l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement prouve que la LCDP reconna\u00eet que les individus font des choix distincts, y compris celui d'avoir des enfants, et que la LCDP prot\u00e8ge tous les individus contre la discrimination envers ces choix.\n[...]\n[233] Le Tribunal conclut que la libert\u00e9 de choisir de devenir p\u00e8re ou m\u00e8re est si vitale qu'elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre restreinte par la crainte de subir des cons\u00e9quences discriminatoires. En tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le Canada devrait reconna\u00eetre cette libert\u00e9 fondamentale et appuyer ce choix autant que possible. Pour l'employeur, cela signifie \u00e9valuer les situations telles que celles de Mme Johnstone de fa\u00e7on individuelle et travailler avec elle pour cr\u00e9er une solution fonctionnelle qui \u00e9quilibre ses obligations parentales avec ses occasions d'emploi, sauf contrainte excessive.\n[157] R\u00e9cemment, le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique (le TDFP) a examin\u00e9 s'il fallait suivre l'approche pour la situation de famille \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt ou celle \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il appliquerait l'approche de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt. Dans la d\u00e9cision Chantal Rajotte c. Le pr\u00e9sident de l'Agence canadienne des services frontaliers et al, 2009 TDFP 0025, le TDFP a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'approche \u00e0 adopter est celle contenue dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, laquelle a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone (paragraphe 127). Le TDFP a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLa preuve doit donc d\u00e9montrer que la plaignante est un parent, qu'elle doit remplir des t\u00e2ches et des obligations comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que, de surcro\u00eet, elle est un parent devant remplir ces t\u00e2ches et ces obligations. La plaignante doit prouver qu'en cons\u00e9quence de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations et de la conduite de l'intim\u00e9, elle n'a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res. (Paragraphe 127)\n[158] Un examen de certaines d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie Britannique (le BCHRT) d\u00e9montre que les d\u00e9cisions de ce Tribunal ne suivent pas uniform\u00e9ment l'approche de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Par exemple, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que cette approche n'\u00e9tait pas applicable dans le cas de la fourniture de services (Stephenson c. Sooke Lake Modular Home Co-operative Association, 2007 BCHRT 341). Cette approche a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e dans deux d\u00e9cisions du BCHRT qui portaient sur une situation d'emploi (Haggerty c. Kamloops Society for Community Living, [2008] BCHRT 172, au paragraphe 17 et Mahdi c. Hertz Canada Limited, [2008] BCHRT 245, aux paragraphes 60 et 61).\n[159] Dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau c. Ferguson Moving (1990) Ltd., dba Ferguson Moving and Storage et al., 2009 BCHRT 272, le BCHRT a mentionn\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions Campbell River, Hoyt et Johnstone, ainsi qu'une autre de ses d\u00e9cisions dans l'affaire Miller c. BCTF (no 2), 2009 BCHRT 34. Le BCHRT a soulign\u00e9 que, dans la d\u00e9cision Miller, il avait conclu que le crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River ne s'appliquait que dans le contexte dans lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9. Le BCHRT a cit\u00e9 l'extrait suivant de la d\u00e9cision Miller : [TRADUCTION] La formulation [dans Campbell River] de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille dans le contexte d'un conflit entre les obligations d'emploi et les obligations familiales ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e m\u00e9caniquement dans tous les cas de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (Falardeau, au paragraphe 29).\n[160] La question en litige dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau \u00e9tait celle de savoir si un employ\u00e9, qui avait refus\u00e9 d'effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales qu'il avait envers son fils, avait subi de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le Tribunal a conclu que le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 31 et 32 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, Ferguson souhaitait maintenir un mod\u00e8le bien \u00e9tabli d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de ses clients. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 M. Falardeau a avis\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s de ses besoins et de ses ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde, les intim\u00e9s croyaient, avec raison selon la preuve dont je suis saisi, que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait ais\u00e9ment capable d'organiser des services de garde pour son fils si ses heures de travail se prolongeaient. En effet, il l'avait fait de nombreuses fois. Le fait que ni le mod\u00e8le de travail de M. Falardeau ni ses demandes ou ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde n'avaient chang\u00e9 laissent entendre qu'il avait peut-\u00eatre soulev\u00e9 la question des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison du fait qu'il n'aimait pas travailler sur les sites de construction, plut\u00f4t qu'en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s familiales.\nRien ne donne \u00e0 penser que son fils avait des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux, ou que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait exceptionnellement qualifi\u00e9 pour prendre soin de son fils. Bien que ces facteurs ne soient pas essentiels pour \u00e9tablir une obligation parentale importante, la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce n'a \u00e9tabli aucun autre facteur qui exempterait M. Falardeau des obligations ordinaires d'un parent qui doit jongler entre les demandes de son emploi et le besoin de fournir des soins appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 ses enfants. Compte tenu de ces faits, je ne peux pas conclure qu'il y a eu atteinte grave aux obligations ou aux devoirs importants parentaux ou familiaux. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[161] Dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau, le BCHRT a essentiellement suivi le raisonnement formul\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Cependant, m\u00eame s'il avait suivi l'approche dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, sa conclusion aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame. La principale diff\u00e9rence entre la situation dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau et celle en l'esp\u00e8ce est que, dans l'affaire Falardeau, il n'y avait eu aucun changement dans l'horaire de travail de M. Falardeau ou dans ses besoins ou ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde. De plus, son employeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de ses besoins et de ses ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde et il croyait, avec raison, que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 obtenir des services de garde pour son fils si ses heures de travail \u00e9taient prolong\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Falardeau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, parce qu'il n'avait pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de participer \u00e9galement et enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 son emploi en raison de ses obligations et de ses devoirs en tant que p\u00e8re.\n[162] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante, en \u00e9tant forc\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, faisait face \u00e0 une atteinte grave \u00e0 ses devoirs et obligations de m\u00e8re. L'affaire aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si la plaignante avait refus\u00e9 d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 son terminal local.\n[163] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la Compagnie a soutenu que la position de la plaignante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une pr\u00e9misse erron\u00e9e. Il a qualifi\u00e9 la plainte de demande visant \u00e0 ce que l'employeur prenne des mesures d'accommodement pour les [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales et les choix de vie de la plaignante. Il a ajout\u00e9 que cette position \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une interpr\u00e9tation extr\u00eamement large de la LCDP et que la seule caract\u00e9ristique soulev\u00e9e par la plaignante qui pouvait d\u00e9clencher la protection pr\u00e9vue par la loi \u00e9tait le fait qu'elle est une m\u00e8re et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle doit prendre soin de ses enfants. L'avocat a ajout\u00e9 que le fait d'exiger qu'un employ\u00e9 qui a des enfants respecte sa responsabilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail comme l'exige la convention collective ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En fait, il a soutenu que le refus d'un employ\u00e9 de respecter ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet constitue un choix qui est de nature exclusivement personnelle et pour lequel, en l'absence de circonstances exceptionnelles, un employeur n'a aucune obligation d'accommodement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a conclu que le fait d'accueillir la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 ajouter les [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales \u00e0 la liste des motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP, sous le couvert de l'expansion de la notion de situation de famille.\n[164] \u00c0 l'appui de ces arguments, l'avocat a mentionn\u00e9 de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions, y compris la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River, qui, \u00e0 son avis, pr\u00e9sentait une approche plus structur\u00e9e et pragmatique que celle de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt du Tribunal. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision arbitrale Canadian Staff Union c. Canadian Union of Public Employees, (2006) 88 C.L.A.S. 212. Dans cette affaire, le plaignant avait refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Halifax apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 que le lieu d'emploi serait Halifax. Le plaignant habitait \u00e0 St. John's (Terre-Neuve), o\u00f9 il avait la garde partag\u00e9e de ses enfants avec son ancienne \u00e9pouse. Il \u00e9tait aussi responsable de prendre soin de sa m\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e. Le syndicat a soutenu que la notion de situation de famille ne se limitait pas au statut de p\u00e8re ou de m\u00e8re comme tel, mais s'\u00e9tendait aussi \u00e0 l'accommodement des responsabilit\u00e9s familiales du plaignant.\n[165] Selon la d\u00e9cision arbitrale, le grief soulevait des questions importantes de droits de la personne qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9es comme suit : [TRADUCTION] la d\u00e9signation par un employeur d'un lieu g\u00e9ographique pr\u00e9cis dans un affichage d'emploi, et l'insistance par celui-ci qu'un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite obtenir ce poste habite \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 il peut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 ce lieu, constitue-t-elle une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille, si les responsabilit\u00e9s matrimoniales et familiales de l'employ\u00e9 l'emp\u00eachent r\u00e9ellement d'habiter l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il peut se pr\u00e9senter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au travail au lieu pr\u00e9cis\u00e9? (au paragraphe 6).\n[166] 166. L'arbitre a rejet\u00e9 le grief au motif que [TRADUCTION] au sens de toute loi pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce et de la convention collective, c'\u00e9tait le choix du plaignant, et non ses responsabilit\u00e9s matrimoniales et familiales, qui l'emp\u00eachait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Halifax (au paragraphe 9). L'arbitre a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] ce que l'employeur a fait ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial ou sur la situation de famille et l'employeur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu par la loi de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour le plaignant jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive.\n[167] Dans son analyse des d\u00e9cisions pertinentes, l'arbitre a adopt\u00e9 l'approche restreinte de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la situation de famille. Bien que la d\u00e9cision soit int\u00e9ressante, le Tribunal note que les faits li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision arbitrale sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans la d\u00e9cision arbitrale, le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste, sachant pertinemment que la description de poste pr\u00e9cisait que l'emploi \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Halifax. Le plaignant avait le choix de refuser d'aller \u00e0 Halifax et de rester dans son poste \u00e0 St. John's, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce, dont le choix \u00e9tait de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Les faits donnent aussi \u00e0 penser qu'il n'y avait pas d'augmentation de salaire ou d'avantages importants pour le poste \u00e0 Halifax par rapport \u00e0 celui de St. John's et que le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature parce qu'il souhait vivre un changement et de nouveaux d\u00e9fis (paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal note aussi que l'un des enfants du plaignant avait 19 ans et commen\u00e7ait l'universit\u00e9 et que l'autre avait 15 ans et commen\u00e7ait l'\u00e9cole secondaire et que, comme l'arbitre l'a mentionn\u00e9, bien que les fils du plaignant tiraient sans aucun doute des avantages importants de sa pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 St. John's, ils n'avaient besoin d'aucun soin sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 de sa part et il pouvait s'organiser pour assurer leur bien-\u00eatre en son absence (au paragraphe 141).\n[168] L'avocat de la Compagnie a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario Wight c. Ontario (no 2), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/191, qui portait sur une employ\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, avait refus\u00e9 de retourner au travail en soutenant qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable d'obtenir des services de garde appropri\u00e9s. Elle a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e au motif qu'elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a conclu que la plaignante avait [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9goriquement refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre les attentes raisonnables de son employeur qu'elle prenne les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour retourner au travail \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Le Tribunal a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle allait \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 jusqu'en octobre au plus t\u00f4t ou en janvier au plus tard (au paragraphe 321). Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un cas d'une personne qui, malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, ne pouvait pas trouver de services de garde pour son enfant et devait choisir entre son enfant et son emploi. Une fois de plus, il s'agit d'une situation dont les faits diff\u00e8rent beaucoup de la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[169] L'avocat a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Smith c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2008 TCDP 15, une d\u00e9cision rendue en mai 2008 par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Le Tribunal ne voit pas en quoi cette d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre comparable \u00e0 la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans l'affaire Smith, bien que le plaignant e\u00fbt soutenu, entre autres, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, le Tribunal a conclu que ce motif de discrimination n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans la plainte et qu'aucune jurisprudence n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour d\u00e9montrer que les faits constituaient une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (au paragraphe 289).\n[170] L'avocat de la Compagnie a finalement mentionn\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer canadiens (le Bureau). Bien qu'elles soient int\u00e9ressantes, toutes les d\u00e9cisions du Bureau sont fond\u00e9es sur des faits particuliers et elles ne nous aident pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[171] Le Tribunal ne souscrit pas non plus \u00e0 l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel un concept ouvert de la situation de famille donnerait lieu \u00e0 une avalanche de demandes et que cela risquerait de causer de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux au travail. Comme la Human Rights and Citizenship Commission de l'Alberta l'a not\u00e9 au paragraphe 242 de sa d\u00e9cision Rawleigh c. Canada Safeway Ltd, rendue le 29 septembre 2009, [TRADUCTION] chaque affaire doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres. Le fait d'appuyer la croyance qu'une avalanche pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e par des personnes opportunistes est tr\u00e8s dangereux et possiblement discriminatoire.\n[172] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d'autres cours ont toujours soutenu que les droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. Dans l'arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 :\n24 La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu'en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu'elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu'offre la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu'elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s'interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\n[173] Selon l'analyse pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le Tribunal conclut qu'il existe deux interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes dans la jurisprudence au sujet de l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille : l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River et l'interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt. Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'approche de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River a pour effet d'imposer une hi\u00e9rarchie des motifs de discrimination, certains motifs, comme la situation de famille, \u00e9tant consid\u00e9r\u00e9s moins importants que les autres. Cette approche ne suit pas l'objet de la LCDP. De plus, toutes les permutations de l'approche appliqu\u00e9e au motif de la situation de famille en Colombie-Britannique qui ont suivi l'arr\u00eat Campbell River appuient la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle la situation de famille ne devrait pas \u00eatre isol\u00e9e sous une norme diff\u00e9rente et plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re ou plus lourde d'\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie. La seule solution est d'appliquer le m\u00eame crit\u00e8re que celui appliqu\u00e9 pour les autres motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP. Cette approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt et a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone.\n[174] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suivrai l'approche \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, qui respecte le principe des droits de la personne selon lequel tous les motifs de discrimination doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale.\n[175] De plus, tenant compte de la nature et du statut sp\u00e9ciaux des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en tant que lois quasi-constitutionnelles, le Tribunal conclut que l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de la situation de famille telles qu'elles sont propos\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt sont celles qu'il convient d'adopter. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, selon laquelle les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent une interpr\u00e9tation large, alors que les exceptions et les d\u00e9fenses sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on plus restreinte.\n(iii) Une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie? [176] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, le Tribunal, appliquant l'approche de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, conclut que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. En raison de ses obligations familiales, elle a perdu son emploi, alors que d'autres employ\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s.\n[177] La plaignante est une m\u00e8re seule et son gar\u00e7on, en juillet 2005, avait cinq ans. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque vis\u00e9e en 2005, la plaignante \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied. Son fils avait re\u00e7u un diagnostic de difficult\u00e9s respiratoires et avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 vers des sp\u00e9cialistes. Plusieurs rendez-vous \u00e9taient pr\u00e9vus pour lui en avril 2005 avec un sp\u00e9cialiste de la m\u00e9decine respiratoire p\u00e9diatrique.\n[178] En f\u00e9vrier 2005, la plaignante a re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de la Compagnie lui disant qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Apr\u00e8s avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec son repr\u00e9sentant syndical, elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Compagnie pour demander une prorogation de 30 jours du d\u00e9lai, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective.\n[179] Le 18 mars 2005, elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia pour lui expliquer sa situation, les probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux de son fils et les probl\u00e8mes de garde l\u00e9gale qui pourraient survenir si elle quittait Jasper. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre exempt\u00e9e du rappel \u00e0 Vancouver pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire.\n[180] Le 25 avril 2005, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une lettre de la Compagnie l'avisant que la Compagnie avait pris des mesures d'accommodement pour elle en lui accordant plus de temps pour prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires au sujet de la garde de son fils et l'avisant qu'elle devait g\u00e9rer ses obligations personnelles de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00eatre en mesure de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations d'emploi. Le 30 avril 2005, elle a aussi re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de son superviseur, M. Pizziol, qui l'a avis\u00e9e que, bien que la Compagnie comprenne sa situation, la plaignante devait fournir une date raisonnable \u00e0 laquelle elle se pr\u00e9senterait \u00e0 Vancouver. Le m\u00eame jour, elle a \u00e9crit une deuxi\u00e8me lettre \u00e0 M. Torchia dans laquelle elle a expliqu\u00e9 de nouveau l'\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de son fils et dans laquelle elle demandait \u00e0 le rencontrer. Le 22 juin 2005, elle a aussi re\u00e7u un appel de Mme Storms, qui lui a dit qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver le 2 juillet 2005. La plaignante a alors \u00e9crit une troisi\u00e8me lettre \u00e0 M. Torchia, r\u00e9it\u00e9rant sa situation de famille.\n[181] La preuve ne montre pas que la plaignante \u00e9tait une m\u00e8re qui pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait rester \u00e0 la maison et ne pas travailler du tout. La preuve \u00e9tablit que les chefs de train sur les chemins de fer ont des horaires impr\u00e9visibles et pourtant, la plaignante avait pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour satisfaire \u00e0 la gamme compl\u00e8te de ses obligations \u00e0 titre de chef de train, y compris \u00eatre sur appel \u00e0 deux heures d'avis, sept jours par semaine, pour pouvoir travailler \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de Jasper. Le seul probl\u00e8me pour elle \u00e9tait qu'elle ne pouvait pas laisser son fils \u00e0 Jasper au moment de la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[182] Dans ses divers \u00e9changes avec la Compagnie, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 sa situation de famille. Cependant, elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales telles que la garde d'enfants n'\u00e9taient pas des [TRADUCTION] raisons satisfaisantes pour qu'un employ\u00e9 soit exempt\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. La Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que la situation de la plaignante ne n\u00e9cessitait pas d'accommodement en raison de sa situation de famille au sens de la LCDP. Elle \u00e9tait aussi d'avis que la situation de la plaignante \u00e9tait un choix personnel de ne pas respecter ses obligations professionnelles afin de donner priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres aspects de sa vie, une situation que la Compagnie a qualifi\u00e9 d'\u00e9quilibre [TRADUCTION] travail-famille.\n[183] En contre-interrogatoire, M. Torchia a reconnu que les pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante \u00e9taient l\u00e9gitimes et qu'elle avait droit \u00e0 des mesures d'accommodement. Cependant, \u00e0 son avis, la plaignante avait simplement besoin de plus de temps pour r\u00e9gler sa situation et c'est ce qu'il lui a accord\u00e9. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] injuste de conclure qu'il n'avait pas appliqu\u00e9 la politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement de la Compagnie : [TRADUCTION] Elles avaient des pr\u00e9occupations familiales et j'ai pris des mesures d'accommodement pour elles en prolongeant le d\u00e9lai qu'elles avaient pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Elles [la plaignante, Cindy Richards et Denise Seeley] ont obtenu des mesures d'accommodement visant \u00e0 leur donner du temps pour s'organiser. Elles ne l'ont pas fait et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9es. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter qu'il a aussi ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Dans le cas des deux plaignantes [Cindy Richards et Kasha Whyte], j'\u00e9tais d'avis qu'elles avaient des raisons satisfaisantes et c'est pourquoi je leur ai accord\u00e9 une prorogation du d\u00e9lai lorsque j'ai pris connaissance de leur situation. Ce n'est pas la position que la Compagnie avait adopt\u00e9e devant l'arbitre.\n[184] Le Tribunal conclut que le droit n'appuie simplement pas le point de vue de la Compagnie selon lequel la situation de famille ne comprend pas la situation de la plaignante. La situation de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de m\u00e8re seule ainsi que les ramifications, qu'elle a expliqu\u00e9es dans ses diverses lettres, du fait de lui ordonner de se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver la placent dans la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 la Compagnie et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande aux responsables de la Compagnie. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont expliqu\u00e9 qu'une telle demande aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 qui en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait Colin Pizziol, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper. Malheureusement, M. Pizziol n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, et les autres t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ne pouvaient pas expliquer de quelle fa\u00e7on il avait g\u00e9r\u00e9 la situation, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. La preuve incontest\u00e9e de la plaignante \u00e9tait que ni son superviseur, ni un autre gestionnaire de la Compagnie n'avaient r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses lettres ni pris le temps de discuter de la situation avec elle.\n[185] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la plaignante est une m\u00e8re et que ce statut comprend les devoirs et les obligations qui reviennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aux parents. En raison de ces devoirs et obligations, la plaignante, selon les r\u00e8gles et les pratiques de la Compagnie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de participer de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale et compl\u00e8te \u00e0 son emploi au sein de la Compagnie. Cela \u00e9tant, le fardeau repose maintenant sur la Compagnie de d\u00e9montrer que la norme ou l'action discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en raison d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n(iv) La Compagnie a-t-elle pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante? [186] Le crit\u00e8re applicable pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite dans le contexte de l'emploi et si un employeur a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour un employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive est celui \u00e9tabli par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a normalis\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re applicable quant \u00e0 la discrimination et a rejet\u00e9 l'ancienne distinction entre la discrimination directe et indirecte.\n[187] Lorsqu'un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le fardeau est alors transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'employeur, qui doit d\u00e9montrer que l'acte ou la norme discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ). \u00c0 ce sujet, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 54 et 55 de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin :\nL'employeur peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s\nqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\nCette m\u00e9thode est fond\u00e9e sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir des normes qui composent avec l'apport potentiel de tous les employ\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela peut \u00eatre fait sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive. Il est \u00e9vident que des normes peuvent l\u00e9ser les membres d'un groupe particulier. Mais, comme le juge Wilson l'a fait remarquer dans Central Alberta Dairy Pool, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 518, [s]'il est possible de trouver une solution raisonnable qui \u00e9vite d'imposer une r\u00e8gle donn\u00e9e aux membres d'un groupe, cette r\u00e8gle ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme [une EPJ]. Il s'ensuit que la r\u00e8gle ou la norme jug\u00e9e raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire doit composer avec les diff\u00e9rences individuelles dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne cause aucune contrainte excessive. \u00c0 moins qu'aucun accommodement ne soit possible sans imposer une contrainte excessive, la norme telle qu'elle existe n'est pas une EPJ, et la preuve prima facie de l'existence de discrimination n'est pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9.\nLa norme a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour un objectif rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail?\n[188] Le crit\u00e8re neutre en question en l'esp\u00e8ce est l'exigence de se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocate de la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne contestait pas que la capacit\u00e9 de la Compagnie d'exiger que des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s soient forc\u00e9s de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e9tait rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 son objectif d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en mesure de transf\u00e9rer des employ\u00e9s rapidement aux endroits o\u00f9 il y a p\u00e9nurie afin de garantir le fonctionnement continu des trains. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle elle-m\u00eame comprend la capacit\u00e9 d'un chef de train de ne pas se d\u00e9placer s'il y a une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante.\nL'employeur a-t-il adopt\u00e9 une norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant de bonne foi qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'accomplissement de cet objectif l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail?\n[189] Une fois de plus, la plaignante ne contestait pas la croyance de bonne foi selon laquelle, d'un point de vue op\u00e9rationnel, la Compagnie avait besoin d'\u00eatre en mesure de forcer des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries. La preuve des repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat et de la Compagnie \u00e9tait que ces stipulations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9es dans la convention collective.\nLa Compagnie a-t-elle \u00e9tabli qu'elle ne pouvait pas prendre de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante en raison de contraintes excessives?\n[190] La troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re t\u00e2che de la Compagnie est de d\u00e9montrer que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire afin que l'employeur puisse accomplir son objectif. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, la Compagnie doit \u00e9tablir qu'elle ne peut pas prendre de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et les autres personnes n\u00e9gativement touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir de contrainte excessive. En d'autres mots, comme la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement touch\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille par la norme for\u00e7ant les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 couvrir des p\u00e9nuries, la Compagnie aurait-elle pu l'accommoder sans subir de contrainte excessive?\n[191] L'utilisation de l'expression excessive laisse entendre qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Ce n'est que la contrainte excessive qui satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. (Voir Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, \u00e0 la page 984.) Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive. (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62.) De plus, lorsqu'un employeur \u00e9value s'il est en mesure d'accommoder un employ\u00e9, il doit effectuer une analyse individuelle de la situation de l'employ\u00e9. \u00c0 ce sujet, dans l'arr\u00eat Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 161, au paragraphe 22, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : Le caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 du processus d'accommodement ne saurait \u00eatre minimis\u00e9.\n[192] Dans l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521, le juge Wilson a examin\u00e9 les facteurs dont il faut tenir compte lors de l'\u00e9valuation de l'obligation d'un employeur d'accommoder un employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive. Parmi les facteurs pertinents se trouvent le co\u00fbt financier de la m\u00e9thode possible d'accommodement, l'interchangeabilit\u00e9 relative de l'effectif et des installations et la possibilit\u00e9 d'interf\u00e9rence importante avec les droits d'autres employ\u00e9s. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la norme ou la pratique qui exclut des membres d'un groupe particulier en fonction d'hypoth\u00e8ses relevant de l'impression est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suspecte. (Colombie-Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868, (Grismer), paragraphes 20 et 31.) Les employeurs doivent faire preuve d'innovation, tout en restant pratiques, lorsqu'ils examinent les options d'accommodement dans une situation particuli\u00e8re.\n[193] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la Compagnie a laiss\u00e9 entendre que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada avait reformul\u00e9 les principes qui s'appliquent \u00e0 la notion de contrainte excessive dans l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), [2008] 2 R.C.S. 561. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cette interpr\u00e9tation de cet arr\u00eat et n'est pas d'avis qu'il s'agit d'une reformulation du concept de contrainte excessive. Au contraire, le Tribunal conclut que cet arr\u00eat correspond aux d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de la Cour supr\u00eame au sujet de la question des accommodements. Dans l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que l'employeur n'ait pas l'obligation de changer les conditions de travail de fa\u00e7on fondamentale, il a l'obligation, s'il peut le faire sans contrainte excessive, de modifier le lieu de travail ou les t\u00e2ches d'un employ\u00e9 afin de lui permettre d'effectuer son travail (au paragraphe 16). La Cour supr\u00eame a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu' [e]n raison du caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 de l'obligation d'accommodement et de la diversit\u00e9 des circonstances qui peuvent survenir, toute r\u00e8gle rigide est \u00e0 \u00e9viter. Si une entreprise peut, sans en subir de contrainte excessive, offrir des horaires de travail variables ou assouplir la t\u00e2che de l'employ\u00e9, ou m\u00eame \u00e0 autoriser des d\u00e9placements de personnel, permettant \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de fournir sa prestation de travail, l'employeur devra alors ainsi accommoder l'employ\u00e9 (paragraphe 17). (Voir aussi Jonhstone c. Agence des services frontaliers, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 218.)\n[194] La Compagnie soutient que, si l'accommodement \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP, elle avait fourni un [TRADUCTION] accommodement raisonnable \u00e0 la plaignante pendant plus de quatre (4) mois pour qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver, plut\u00f4t que le minimum de quinze (15) jours \u00e9tabli dans la convention collective. La Compagnie soutient aussi que le fait d'accorder l'indemnit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par la plaignante constituerait une contrainte excessive parce que cela reviendrait \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui sont parents l'\u00e9quivalent d'une [TRADUCTION] super anciennet\u00e9 dans la convention collective, simplement en raison de leur statut de parents.\n[195] Je traiterai d'abord de l'argument au sujet de l' accommodement raisonnable.\n[196] La Compagnie soutient que le fait d'accorder du temps de plus \u00e0 la plaignante pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9tait tout ce qu'elle avait l'obligation de faire. Cependant, la preuve montre clairement que cela n'\u00e9tait pas du tout une r\u00e9ponse valable \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante ni au fondement factuel de sa situation, qu'elle avait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 son employeur dans ses diverses lettres. La preuve montre aussi que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sans qu'un repr\u00e9sentant de la Compagnie n'en discute avec la plaignante.\n[197] La preuve \u00e9tablit que la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia et \u00e0 d'autres gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs de la Compagnie pour exposer les d\u00e9tails de sa situation de famille et son \u00e9valuation de la raison pour laquelle ses obligations et ses responsabilit\u00e9s envers sa famille l'emp\u00eachaient de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. La plaignante a aussi clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate et dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les aspects de son emploi \u00e0 titre de chef de train \u00e0 Jasper, o\u00f9 elle avait le soutien n\u00e9cessaire pour prendre soin de son enfant.\n[198] La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que la Compagnie n'a pas fait preuve de compassion envers la situation de la plaignante. Elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses nombreuses demandes de mesures d'accommodement et personne n'a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante, ni n'a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle, pour discuter de sa situation, m\u00eame si la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie pr\u00e9voit que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus doit \u00eatre une rencontre avec l'employ\u00e9. La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi clairement que Mme Storms et M. Torchia ne se sentaient pas responsables au sujet de questions relevant de la LCDP. Ils ont tous les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 et les responsables des ressources humaines sont les personnes aupr\u00e8s desquelles la question aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e. Malheureusement, M. Pizziol, le superviseur de la plaignante, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, et Mme Mary-Jane Morrison, la personne responsable des ressources humaines \u00e0 Edmonton en 2005, ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus.\n[199] Il est clair que les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ne consid\u00e9raient pas la situation de famille - du moins les questions de situation de famille qui comprennent des obligations et des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales - comme un motif de discrimination qui n\u00e9cessitait une forme d'accommodement. Dans leur conception des divers motifs de discrimination \u00e9tablis dans la LCDP, il semble qu'ils ont choisi certains motifs qui, selon eux, donnent droit \u00e0 un accommodement, alors que d'autres n'y ouvrent pas droit. Par exemple, ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Compagnie n'avait pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 accommoder des employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, mais qui ne pouvaient pas y aller en raison d'un parent malade. Ils ont aussi reconnu que la Compagnie, dans le pass\u00e9, avait accommod\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Cependant, sans chercher \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la nature de sa demande, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation de la plaignante ne constituait pas une situation n\u00e9cessitant un accommodement en vertu de la LCDP.\n[200] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait au courant de la situation de la plaignante et qu'il en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle avait besoin de plus de temps pour r\u00e9gler sa situation. Il n'a jamais discut\u00e9 avec la plaignante et n'a jamais d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la question \u00e0 un autre gestionnaire, qui aurait pu discuter de la demande de la plaignante avec elle. Il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il savait ce dont elle avait besoin et qu'il le lui avait donn\u00e9.\n[201] Quant \u00e0 Mme Storms, qui surveillait les feuilles de calcul du CGE, elle savait que la situation de la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e de [TRADUCTION] question de garde d'enfants. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a laiss\u00e9 entendre que de nombreux employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s avaient aussi soulev\u00e9 des questions de garde d'enfants et que cela devenait un th\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cependant, pour aucun autre employ\u00e9, sauf la plaignante, Denise Seeley et Cindy Richards, il n'y avait de mention garde d'enfants inscrite sur la feuille de calcul, et M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne connaissait aucun autre cas o\u00f9 la [TRADUCTION] question de garde d'enfants avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e.\n[202] Comme son service supervisait les renseignements au sujet des employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s, Mme Storms avait eu l'occasion d'avoir recours \u00e0 la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie dans le cas de la plaignante, mais elle ne l'avait pas fait. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait pris des mesures d'accommodement dans le cas d'un autre employ\u00e9 qui avait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. Cet employ\u00e9 avait un parent en phase terminale et elle lui avait accord\u00e9 un cong\u00e9. Un examen des feuilles de calcul du CGE lui avait aussi permis d'apprendre que d'autres employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9s de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver en raison de maladie et pour d'autres raisons personnelles inexpliqu\u00e9es.\n[203] Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 23 juin 2005, Mme Storms a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ses discussions t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec la plaignante, avec Mme Richards et avec Mme Seeley. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante avait un fils malade et qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes quant \u00e0 la garde. Elle a aussi mentionn\u00e9 dans le courriel que la plaignante avait \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia. Elle a aussi \u00e9crit que, si la plaignante et les deux autres femmes d\u00e9cidaient de ne pas se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie, leurs dossiers d'emploi seraient ferm\u00e9s et elles renonceraient \u00e0 leur anciennet\u00e9. Ce courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gallegos et copi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Nashman, \u00e0 M. Torchia, \u00e0 Kenneth Sherman et \u00e0 Brian Kalin (le superviseur de M. Pizziol). Aucun de ces gestionnaires n'a cru qu'il pouvait \u00eatre appropri\u00e9, compte tenu de la situation de la plaignante, d'avoir recours \u00e0 la politique d'accommodement.\n[204] La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi que la Compagnie n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 ses propres directives et politiques d'accommodement dans le cas de la plaignante. La Compagnie a une politique d'accommodement tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te. Cette politique reconna\u00eet tous les motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP, y compris la situation de famille, et la politique indique clairement que, lorsque cela est possible, les politiques et les pratiques d'emploi doivent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es afin qu'[TRADUCTION] aucune personne ne se voie refuser d'occasion d'emploi . Elle pr\u00e9cise aussi que l'accommodement [TRADUCTION] signifie le fait de d\u00e9ployer tous les efforts possibles pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins raisonnables des employ\u00e9s.\n[205] Les [TRADUCTION] directives d'accommodement de la Compagnie expliquent que l'objectif de la politique est [TRADUCTION] de garantir que les conditions de travail ne sont pas un obstacle \u00e0 l'emploi. Elles \u00e9tablissent aussi clairement que la Compagnie doit faire preuve de souplesse pour \u00e9liminer les obstacles et qu'elle devrait d\u00e9ployer [TRADUCTION] tous les efforts pour garantir que personne n'est d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 en raison d'une exigence ou d'un besoin sp\u00e9cial .\n[206] La politique d\u00e9finit aussi le processus \u00e0 suivre dans le cas d'une demande d'accommodement pour l'un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP et fournit une liste de v\u00e9rification que les gestionnaires et les superviseurs doivent suivre dans le cas d'une telle demande. La politique explique :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 faire lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 signale un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial est de rencontrer cette personne. Permettez \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter le probl\u00e8me ou le besoin, posez-lui des questions pour bien comprendre la demande et discutez ensemble de solutions possibles.\nSi aucune solution ne peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on, ne rejetez pas la demande imm\u00e9diatement. Demandez des conseils, tentez d'obtenir d'autres solutions au probl\u00e8me et \u00e9valuez les r\u00e9percussions de tout accommodement possible aupr\u00e8s des personnes appropri\u00e9es, y compris le service du personnel, entre autres. L'employ\u00e9 a la responsabilit\u00e9 de participer activement au processus et de faciliter l'accommodement raisonnable. Les syndicats ont aussi un r\u00f4le et une responsabilit\u00e9 importants et reconnus dans l'accommodement des besoins des employ\u00e9s.\nIl est extr\u00eamement important de garder des dossiers de la r\u00e9union, des diverses solutions propos\u00e9es et des arguments utilis\u00e9s pour accepter ou rejeter chaque option. Ces renseignements sont indispensables en cas de plainte.\nAvisez rapidement la personne en question de la d\u00e9cision prise, en expliquant les raisons de la d\u00e9cision. Dans le cas du rejet d'une demande d'accommodement, l'employ\u00e9 peut avoir le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief en fonction de la proc\u00e9dure de grief appropri\u00e9e ou de pr\u00e9senter une plainte en vertu de la LCDP.\n[207] Mme Ziemer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la politique vise \u00e0 effectuer une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de l'employ\u00e9, car chaque situation est diff\u00e9rente. Dans le cas de la plaignante, il est clair qu'aucune \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e.\n[208] La personne responsable de la politique d'accommodement au bureau d'Edmonton de la Compagnie est, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mary-Jane Morrison, une agente des ressources humaines. C'est elle que consultent les personnes qui ont des questions au sujet de la politique ou de sa proc\u00e9dure. Mme Morrison n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. La Compagnie a plut\u00f4t appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner Stephanie Ziemer, l'agente des ressources humaines \u00e0 Vancouver. Mme Ziemer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de ce qui, \u00e0 son avis, \u00e9tait couvert par la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que, de son point de vue \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire des ressources humaines, la situation de famille signifiait qu'un employeur ne peut pas agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers une personne qui a une famille, que ce soit un parent qui a des enfants ou toute personne qui est membre d'une famille. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] certainement, la situation de famille, de ce que j'en comprends [...] ne comprendrait pas toute obligation individuelle parentale. Ces obligations sont tr\u00e8s individuelles, il s'agit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles propres \u00e0 chaque individu et je n'ai certainement jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'elles relevaient de notre politique et qu'il fallait s'immiscer dans ces types de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales individuelles.\n[209] En contre-interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Ziemer d'expliquer ce qu'elle voulait dire par [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales individuelles. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] La question de savoir si vous voulez \u00eatre \u00e0 la maison, par exemple, pour coucher votre enfant. La question de savoir si vous voulez assister \u00e0 chaque activit\u00e9 sportive de votre enfant. Je veux dire que ce sont l\u00e0 toutes des choses que nous aimerions faire \u00e0 titre de parents, mais qui ne sont pas suffisantes pour activer le processus d'accommodement. Elle a cependant ajout\u00e9 que le fait de prendre soin d'un enfant malade, d'avoir des probl\u00e8mes en raison d'une ordonnance de garde l\u00e9gale, ou d'\u00eatre parent seul sont des situations diff\u00e9rentes et peuvent ouvrir la porte \u00e0 la discussion. Elle a reconnu que la Compagnie s'attendait que les parents seuls, s'ils souhaitent \u00eatre cheminots, g\u00e8rent leur situation afin de s'acquitter de leurs obligations de travail. Cependant, elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que, si quelque chose d'inhabituel se produisait, par exemple, le fait de devoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie, cela pouvait aussi ouvrir la porte aux discussions.\n[210] Lorsque la porte est ouverte, le processus pr\u00e9voit qu'il doit y avoir une rencontre entre l'employ\u00e9 et son superviseur, afin que ce dernier puisse avoir une id\u00e9e du probl\u00e8me. Mme Ziemer a reconnu qu'un simple \u00e9change de lettres \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape ne serait pas efficace. Lors de la r\u00e9union, le superviseur devrait demander plus de renseignements au sujet des raisons de la demande et discuter des solutions possibles.\n[211] Mme Ziemer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas particip\u00e9 directement au cas de la plaignante et qu'elle n'avait aucune connaissance personnelle \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que les ressources humaines n'interviennent pas toujours dans ces cas. Lorsque c'est possible, les questions sont r\u00e9solues au niveau local. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait suffisamment form\u00e9 ses gestionnaires afin qu'ils aient les capacit\u00e9s de prendre de bonnes d\u00e9cisions de gestion, de prot\u00e9ger les op\u00e9rations et d'effectuer, lorsque n\u00e9cessaire, de petites adaptations ou modifications aux conditions d'emploi de l'employ\u00e9.\n[212] Mme Ziemer a donn\u00e9 divers exemples de situations lors desquelles la Compagnie avait accommod\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s en raison de leur situation de famille, en commen\u00e7ant par sa propre situation. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que son mari avait \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9 dans un accident de ski. Pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix semaines, il ne pouvait pas bouger son bras ni le haut de son corps. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'on lui avait permis de ne pas voyager et qu'on lui avait donn\u00e9 un horaire de travail souple. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des accommodements accord\u00e9s \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver afin qu'il puisse \u00eatre disponible pour son fils qui avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s ill\u00e9gales, y compris des activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es aux gangs, et \u00e0 un chef de train dont la fille avait subi un important effondrement psychologique. On avait permis \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 de travailler plus pr\u00e8s de la maison pendant une assez longue p\u00e9riode. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait aussi pris des mesures d'accommodement pour un gestionnaire de march\u00e9 \u00e0 son retour d'un cong\u00e9 parental parce que son enfant souffrait d'un trouble de l'alimentation grave. On a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 du temps de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire apr\u00e8s la fin de son cong\u00e9 parental.\n[213] Lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9e par l'avocat de la CCDP, on a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Ziemer deux autres exemples qu'elle avait mentionn\u00e9s lors de l'audience dans l'affaire Seeley. L'un de ces exemples \u00e9tait une mesure d'accommodement prise pour un employ\u00e9 qui lui permettait d'\u00eatre absent du tableau de service chaque deux semaines, parce qu'il n'avait des droits de visite que pendant 48 heures, la fin de semaine, chaque deux semaines. L'autre exemple portait sur un accommodement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui prenait part \u00e0 une longue bataille pour la garde de ses enfants devant la Cour. On a accord\u00e9 du temps de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 cette personne pour cette raison.\n[214] Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plupart de ces cas avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s au niveau local. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que les superviseurs sont form\u00e9s pour r\u00e9agir \u00e0 ce type de demande. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] malheureusement, nous ne pouvons pas superviser ce qu'ils font sur place en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'application de la formation r\u00e9elle qu'ils ont re\u00e7ue. Nous aimons croire qu'ils sont tous bien au courant de nos politiques, qu'ils sont bien form\u00e9s. Cependant, pour ce qui est de la question de savoir si le superviseur A au lieu B r\u00e9agirait \u00e0 une question qui est soulev\u00e9e, je ne peux pas affirmer que cela serait le cas.\n[215] Selon Mme Ziemer, bien qu'il n'y ait aucun m\u00e9canisme pour l'\u00e9valuation de l'application de la politique, la Compagnie s'attend \u00e0 ce que ses superviseurs de premi\u00e8re ligne fassent la bonne chose en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la politique, qu'ils la respectent et qu'ils se conforment \u00e0 ses subtilit\u00e9s. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, lorsqu'on ne respecte pas la politique, les ressources humaines sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement mises au courant par lettre ou inform\u00e9es par leurs homologues du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des relations de travail. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Compagnie fonctionne selon la notion que ses superviseurs suivent la politique en fonction de ce qu'on leur a appris et des attentes de la Compagnie.\n[216] Mme Ziemer a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9, en contre-interrogatoire, que le processus d\u00e9crit dans la politique d'accommodement d\u00e9bute d\u00e8s qu'un employ\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sente et fait \u00e9tat d'un probl\u00e8me ou d'un besoin sp\u00e9cial, bien qu'elle ait ajout\u00e9 que cela n'entra\u00eene pas n\u00e9cessairement une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si l'accommodement est n\u00e9cessaire. L'avocate de la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi ce processus n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9 dans le cas de la plaignante et elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne savait pas, parce qu'elle n'avait pas pris part \u00e0 l'affaire. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, l'employ\u00e9 communique avec son superviseur imm\u00e9diat en premier lieu.\n[217] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante parce que cela \u00e9tait normalement fait par le superviseur. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas [TRADUCTION] certain si le superviseur de la plaignante l'avait rencontr\u00e9e, mais qu'il [TRADUCTION] s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'il l'ait fait parce qu'il avait eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le superviseur et que ce dernier \u00e9tait au courant de la situation.\n[218] En contre-interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u une formation au sujet de l'obligation d'accommoder [TRADUCTION] il y a de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvient pas avoir re\u00e7u de formation au sujet de la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait au courant de la politique et que, si elle avait des questions \u00e0 ce sujet, elle communiquerait avec quelqu'un aux ressources humaines. Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais r\u00e9ellement utilis\u00e9 la politique d'accommodement, parce que le CGE ne re\u00e7oit pas beaucoup de demandes d'accommodement. Elle a cependant reconnu qu'il y avait eu des cas o\u00f9 le CGE avait pris des mesures d'accommodement pour des employ\u00e9s en raison d'une maladie grave dans la famille de l'employ\u00e9 ou parce qu'un employ\u00e9 avait besoin d'un cong\u00e9 pour des raisons personnelles.\n[219] Elle aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien qu'elle se souvienne avoir lu la politique, elle ne la connaissait pas bien et qu'elle n'avait pas de connaissances d\u00e9taill\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle ne savait pas si un autre employ\u00e9 du CGE avait re\u00e7u une formation sur la politique. Lorsque l'avocat de la CCDP l'a contre-interrog\u00e9e, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance, aucun des r\u00e9partiteurs ou des membres du Groupe de rajustement des tableaux, qui \u00e9taient principalement charg\u00e9s de communiquer avec les employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, n'avaient eu de formation au sujet de la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer comment elle reconna\u00eetrait une question d'accommodement si on lui en pr\u00e9sentait une, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu que les employ\u00e9s du CGE savaient que la Compagnie prenait des mesures d'accommodement pour des employ\u00e9s et que, parfois, ils \u00e9taient au courant de la situation de l'employ\u00e9. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les employ\u00e9s du CGE renvoient au superviseur un employ\u00e9 qui a fait une demande sp\u00e9ciale.\n[220] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, dans sa situation, la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais eu de r\u00e9union avec son superviseur, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper, et qu'elle n'avait jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse aux lettres qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 ses superviseurs ou aux gestionnaires de la Compagnie dans lesquelles elle expliquait sa situation. Rien ne donnait non plus \u00e0 penser qu'elle avait eu une r\u00e9union avec quelqu'un des ressources humaines ou qu'on l'avait aiguill\u00e9e vers une telle personne. La preuve montre clairement que la Compagnie n'a pas respect\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans sa propre politique et qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation de famille, du moins en ce qui a trait aux obligations et aux responsabilit\u00e9s parentales, n'\u00e9tait pas un motif de discrimination pour lequel des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9taient requises. Il est aussi clair que la Compagnie n'a jamais effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de la plaignante, comme elle devait le faire.\n[221] M\u00eame si j'acceptais la preuve selon laquelle la Compagnie avait pris certaines mesures d' accommodement en accordant \u00e0 la plaignante plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, le d\u00e9faut de la Compagnie de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations proc\u00e9durales d\u00e9coulant du devoir d'accommodement aurait en soi constitu\u00e9 une violation des droits de la personne de la plaignante. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu que tant le processus de d\u00e9cision que la d\u00e9cision finale doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s lorsqu'on analyse une EPJ. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 66 : il peut souvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utile, en pratique, d'examiner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, d'abord, la proc\u00e9dure, s'il en est, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l'accommodement, et, ensuite, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte ou, subsidiairement, celle des raisons pour lesquelles l'employeur n'a pas offert une telle norme. (Voir aussi Oak Bay Marina Ltd. c. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal) (no 2), 2004 BCHRT 225, aux paragraphes 84 \u00e0 86).\n[222] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lane c. ADGA Group Consultant Inc., 2007 HRTO 34, au paragraphe 150, (d\u00e9cision maintenue par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l'Ontario, Cour divisionnaire, \u00e0 [2008] O.J. no 3076, 91 O.R. (3d) 649), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe d\u00e9faut de respecter la dimension proc\u00e9durale de l'obligation d'accommodement est une forme de discrimination. Elle prive la personne touch\u00e9e des avantages de ce que la loi exige : la reconnaissance de l'obligation de ne pas faire preuve de discrimination et d'agir d'une telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 garantir qu'aucune discrimination n'a lieu.\n[223] Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les questions suivantes sont pertinentes quant \u00e0 l'analyse de la portion proc\u00e9durale du processus d'accommodement suivi par l'employeur :\nL'employeur a-t-il cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des m\u00e9thodes de rechange qui n'ont pas d'effet discriminatoire, comme les \u00e9valuations individuelles en fonction d'une norme qui tient davantage compte de l'individu? Si des normes diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et jug\u00e9es susceptibles de r\u00e9aliser l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'employeur, pourquoi n'ont-elles pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es? Est-il n\u00e9cessaire que tous les employ\u00e9s satisfassent \u00e0 la norme unique pour que l'employeur puisse r\u00e9aliser l'objet l\u00e9gitime qu'il vise, ou est-il possible d'\u00e9tablir des normes qui refl\u00e8tent les diff\u00e9rences et les capacit\u00e9s collectives ou individuelles? Y a-t-il une mani\u00e8re moins discriminatoire d'effectuer le travail tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime de l'employeur? La norme est-elle bien con\u00e7ue pour que le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis soit atteint sans qu'un fardeau excessif ne soit impos\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux qui sont vis\u00e9s par la norme? Les autres parties qui sont tenues d'aider \u00e0 la recherche de mesures d'accommodement possibles ont-elles jou\u00e9 leur r\u00f4le?\n[224] Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la composante proc\u00e9durale de l'obligation d'accommodement, la Compagnie a l'obligation de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a examin\u00e9 et a raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 tout accommodement qui aurait r\u00e9pondu aux besoins de la plaignante.\n[225] La seule preuve qu'une \u00e9valuation d'autres formes d'accommodement ait pu se produire est la preuve que le Syndicat a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e de solliciter les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper pour voir si certains d'entre eux se porteraient volontaires pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 la place de la plaignante, de Cindy Richards et de Denise Seeley. Cependant, comme personne ne s'est port\u00e9 volontaire, la sollicitation s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9e. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que la Compagnie a effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de la plaignante ou a examin\u00e9 d'autres mesures d'accommodement.\n[226] J'examinerai maintenant la position de la Compagnie au sujet du fait qu'il s'agirait d'une contrainte excessive si l'on accordait \u00e0 la plaignante le redressement qu'elle demande, parce qu'elle obtiendrait alors une super anciennet\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le simple fait qu'elle est m\u00e8re.\n[227] Selon Stephanie Ziemer, la Compagnie ne garde pas de renseignements au sujet du nombre de ses employ\u00e9s qui ont des enfants. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la seule fa\u00e7on d'obtenir ces renseignements serait d'examiner le dossier de chaque employ\u00e9 pour voir le nom des personnes que les employ\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u00e0 leur charge. Mme Ziemer a aussi ajout\u00e9 que selon le r\u00e9gime de prestations d'assurance de groupe des employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie [TRADUCTION] nous pouvons d\u00e9duire qu'environ 69 p. 100 de l'effectif [de la Compagnie] ont des enfants. La m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e par la Compagnie pour produire cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9prouv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience par l'avocate de la plaignante. Cependant, sans compter les probl\u00e8mes de m\u00e9thodologie, le Tribunal conclut que cette preuve partiale est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante par rapport \u00e0 la preuve que la Compagnie devrait produire pour justifier l'acte discriminatoire, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, en fonction du crit\u00e8re de l'EPJ en trois parties de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[228] Si le Tribunal acceptait l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel, en raison du fait que la grande majorit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s ont des enfants, le fait d'accommoder la plaignante lui causerait des contraintes excessives, cela signifierait que tout environnement de travail o\u00f9 un grand nombre de personnes font partie d'un groupe qui poss\u00e8de l'une des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP serait automatiquement exempt\u00e9 de l'application de la loi. Par exemple, cela signifie que des femmes qui travaillent dans un milieu o\u00f9 la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s sont des femmes ne pourraient pas pr\u00e9senter une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Le fait d'accepter l'argument de la Compagnie aurait l'effet de rendre impossible la pr\u00e9sentation d'une plainte fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille - du moins, les questions de situation de famille qui comprennent les obligations et les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales - parce que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s dans l'effectif ont des enfants et pourraient aussi suivre la m\u00eame route.\n[229] La Compagnie n'a produit aucune preuve permettant de conclure qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inond\u00e9e de demandes d'accommodement de la part de personnes dans la m\u00eame situation que la plaignante. Dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 41, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans le contexte de l'accommodement la preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impressions, d'une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. Dans la d\u00e9cision Lane, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 117, la Cour divisionnaire de l'Ontario a ajout\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nOn ne peut pas \u00e9tablir une contrainte excessive en se fondant sur une preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions ou d'anecdotes, ou de justifications apr\u00e8s le fait. Les contraintes anticip\u00e9es caus\u00e9es par une proposition d'accommodement ne devraient pas \u00eatre maintenues si elles ne sont fond\u00e9es que sur des pr\u00e9occupations hypoth\u00e9tiques ou non corrobor\u00e9es que certaines cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pourraient s'ensuivre si des mesures d'accommodement sont prises pour le plaignant.\n[230] Peu importe le fondement particulier de l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel elle subira des contraintes excessives, il est bien \u00e9tabli que l'analyse des contraintes excessives doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans le contexte d'une demande d'accommodement individuelle. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 19, l'accommodement doit \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 la norme m\u00eame afin de garantir que chaque personne est \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction de ses propres habilet\u00e9s personnelles, plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9e en fonction de caract\u00e9ristiques de groupe pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es, qui sont souvent fond\u00e9es sur un parti pris et des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'\u00e9valuation individuelle d'un employ\u00e9 est une \u00e9tape essentielle dans le processus d'accommodement, \u00e0 moins que cette \u00e9valuation en elle-m\u00eame constitue une contrainte excessive pour l'intim\u00e9e (voir Grismer, aux paragraphes 22, 30, 32 et 38; Meiorin, au paragraphe 65; Audet c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 25, au paragraphe 61 et Knight c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de l'Outaouais, 2007 TCDP 15, au paragraphe 72). Une fois de plus, cette \u00e9valuation individuelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e dans le cas de la plaignante.\n[231] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Compagnie n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve voulant que le fait de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante lui causerait une contrainte excessive en ce qui a trait aux co\u00fbts. La seule preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet des co\u00fbts portait sur la formation des chefs de train et il n'y a eu aucune tentative de lier cette preuve \u00e0 la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il faut se souvenir que, pour que les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accommodement soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s excessifs, ils doivent \u00eatre importants. Dans la d\u00e9cision Quesnel c. London Educational Health Centre (1995), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/474 (Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 59 : [TRADUCTION] les co\u00fbts constituent une contrainte excessive seulement s'ils changent la nature essentielle de l'entreprise responsable de l'accommodement ou en changent de fa\u00e7on importante la viabilit\u00e9. La Compagnie a reconnu ce fait dans sa propre politique d'accommodement, qui pr\u00e9cise : [TRADUCTION] Les co\u00fbts encourus doivent \u00eatre extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9s avant que le refus d'accommodement puisse \u00eatre justifi\u00e9. Le fardeau de justifier le refus revient \u00e0 l'employeur. Les co\u00fbts doivent \u00eatre quantifiables et doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accommodement. Les r\u00e9novations ou l'\u00e9quipement sp\u00e9cial peuvent \u00eatre dispendieux, mais il est parfois possible d'obtenir une aide financi\u00e8re de diverses organisations. Aucune preuve de ce genre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\n(v) Conclusion [232] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le Tribunal conclut que la preuve a \u00e9tabli que la Compagnie a viol\u00e9 l'article 7 de la LCDP. La pratique de la Compagnie d'exiger que la plaignante se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur elle en raison de sa situation de famille. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la Compagnie a agi en contravention de l'article 7 de la LDCP en usant de politiques et de pratiques qui ont priv\u00e9 la plaignante d'occasions d'emploi, en raison de sa situation de famille.\n[233] La preuve \u00e9tablit aussi que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9savantag\u00e9e en raison de ses besoins sp\u00e9ciaux et de ses exigences. Les gestionnaires de la Compagnie ne l'ont jamais rencontr\u00e9e. Ils ne lui ont jamais donn\u00e9 l'occasion de pr\u00e9senter et d'expliquer ses besoins et ils ne lui ont pas pos\u00e9 de questions pour mieux comprendre sa demande. Ils n'ont jamais demand\u00e9 l'avis de leur propre service des ressources humaines. S'ils l'avaient fait, on leur aurait certainement recommand\u00e9 de d\u00e9clencher la politique, compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Ziemer selon laquelle la politique est utilis\u00e9e d\u00e8s qu'un employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial, et compte tenu de son t\u00e9moignage au sujet du fait que d'avoir \u00e0 prendre soin d'un enfant malade, d'avoir des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet d'une ordonnance de garde ou d'\u00eatre un parent seul ouvrirait du moins la porte aux discussions.\n[234] Enfin, aucune preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Compagnie ne donnait \u00e0 penser que le fait de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante lui causerait une contrainte excessive.\nD. REDRESSEMENTS [235] La plaignante demande les redressements suivants : une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire et d'avantages sociaux, une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, les d\u00e9pens et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ainsi qu'une ordonnance la r\u00e9tablissant dans son poste \u00e0 la Compagnie avec sa pleine anciennet\u00e9, ses avantages sociaux et toutes les autres occasions ou tous les autres privil\u00e8ges dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. La CCDP demande aussi une ordonnance selon laquelle la Compagnie doit cesser tout comportement ou toute pratique discriminatoires et doit r\u00e9viser sa politique d'accommodement.\n(i) Une ordonnance visant \u00e0 ce que la Compagnie r\u00e9vise sa politique d'accommodement [236] La CCDP demande une ordonnance, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, pour que la Compagnie prenne des mesures, en consultation avec la CCDP, afin de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d'accommodement appropri\u00e9es pour ses employ\u00e9s en raison de la situation de famille, y compris les questions d'obligations et de responsabilit\u00e9s parentales. Elle demande aussi une ordonnance pour qu'une formation appropri\u00e9e en droits de la personne soit mise en place pour les gestionnaires, les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines et le personnel de gestion des \u00e9quipes de la Compagnie et que des s\u00e9ances d'information r\u00e9guli\u00e8res sur les politiques d'accommodement soient offertes afin d'\u00e9liminer les attitudes et les pr\u00e9somptions discriminatoires li\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de discrimination.\n[237] Bien que le Tribunal reconnaisse que la Compagnie a une bonne politique d'accommodement, il est clair qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e ou mise en uvre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 la situation de famille constitue un motif de discrimination. Une partie de la preuve a aussi d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la politique n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9e depuis les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal Audet c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2006] TCDP 25, et Hoyt, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Tout au plus, selon Cathy Smolynek, la directrice principale des services de sant\u00e9 au travail de la Compagnie, certains changements de processus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la question de la d\u00e9ficience dans la politique.\n[238] Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 les directives en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement dans sa d\u00e9cision et a conclu que les gestionnaires et les superviseurs n'ont pas respect\u00e9 la politique dans le cas de la plaignante. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, le Tribunal conclut que la demande de la CCDP est justifi\u00e9e.\n[239] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de travailler en collaboration avec la Commission afin de garantir que la pratique et le comportement discriminatoires ne se poursuivent pas et de veiller \u00e0 ce que :\nles politiques, pratiques et proc\u00e9dures appropri\u00e9es sont en place la Compagnie, en collaboration avec la CCDP, embauche les personnes appropri\u00e9es pour donner une formation en milieu de travail aux gestionnaires, aux employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines, et aux employ\u00e9s du CGE au sujet des questions de discrimination et de droits de la personne, et particuli\u00e8rement au sujet de l'accommodement pour le motif de la situation de famille.\n(ii) R\u00e9tablissement [240] La plaignante demande au Tribunal, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, d'ordonner \u00e0 la Compagnie de la r\u00e9tablir dans son poste de chef de train. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que, lorsque le Tribunal juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, il peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte discriminatoire l'a priv\u00e9e.\n[241] Pour que ce redressement soit appliqu\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante doit donc \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie dans son poste sans perte d'anciennet\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de r\u00e9tablir la plaignante dans son poste de chef de train au terminal de Jasper, apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait mis \u00e0 jour, au besoin, sa fiche de r\u00e8gles et sa fiche m\u00e9dicale.\n[242] Il y a trois dates de d\u00e9but possibles que le Tribunal pourrait utiliser pour r\u00e9tablir la plaignante. La premi\u00e8re date est celle du 2 juillet 2005, qui peut \u00eatre vue comme la date d'application de la demande de la plaignante d'\u00eatre accommod\u00e9e en \u00e9tant affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Jasper. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cette date parce que rien ne prouve que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque ou que cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une mesure d'accommodement appropri\u00e9e si la Compagnie avait respect\u00e9 sa politique d'accommodement. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que des employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\n[243] La deuxi\u00e8me date est celle du 1er mars 2006. Selon la preuve, il s'agit de la date \u00e0 laquelle un autre employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 Jasper, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 et s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper. Comme seulement quatre employ\u00e9s de Jasper, la plaignante, Denise Seeley, Cindy Richartds et cet autre employ\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, il pourrait \u00eatre raisonnable de s'attendre que les quatre employ\u00e9s auraient aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper vers mars 2006. Il convient aussi de noter que la plaignante \u00e9tait l'employ\u00e9e en mise \u00e0 pied qui avait le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] comme l'anciennet\u00e9 de la plaignante est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s de celle [de l'autre employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9], on peut conclure qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper au m\u00eame moment.\n[244] Enfin, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 selon lequel en mars 2007, la Compagnie a embauch\u00e9 de nouveaux chefs de train \u00e0 Jasper et qu'un grand nombre de ces nouveaux chefs de train ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est raisonnable de conclure, compte tenu du fait que la plaignante avait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, une priorit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 sur ces nouveaux chefs de train, qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper avant eux.\n[245] Compte tenu de l'aveu de Mme Storms, on peut conclure que la plaignante aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e en mars 2006 si elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, et cette date est donc celle retenue pour son r\u00e9tablissement.\n[246] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9, comme l'anciennet\u00e9 continue m\u00eame lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est en mise \u00e0 pied, elle continuera de s'accumuler comme s'il n'y avait jamais eu de rupture dans sa relation avec la Compagnie le 2 juillet 2005.\n(iii) Indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire [247] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour tout le salaire et les avantages qu'elle a perdus, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de ma conclusion au sujet de la date de r\u00e9tablissement, j'ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour toute perte de salaire et d'avantages \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2006 jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. J'ordonne aux parties de calculer le montant du salaire en fonction de la formule pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. En ce qui a trait aux paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'un chef de train peut recevoir, comme il serait difficile pour le Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir un montant, le Tribunal ordonne aux parties qu'elles \u00e9tablissent ce montant en examinant les montants suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un conducteur travaillant dans le terminal qui aurait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable, en supposant que le chef de train n'avait pas d'absences inhabituelles. Par exemple, les parties pourraient tenir compte des paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006.\n[248] Selon les d\u00e9clarations de revenu de la plaignante pour 2006, son revenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 7 580 $. Cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, elle a travaill\u00e9 comme serveuse dans un restaurant \u00e0 Jasper. En janvier 2007, le restaurant o\u00f9 elle travaillait a ferm\u00e9. Le 2 f\u00e9vrier 2007, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler au m\u00eame centre de r\u00e9novations o\u00f9 Cindy Richards travaillait. Pendant cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0, son revenu a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 22 462 $. En 2008, son salaire au centre de r\u00e9novations a \u00e9t\u00e9 de 27 413 $. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son salaire horaire pour 2009 serait de 14 $, de 36 \u00e0 40 heures par semaine, pour un total de 28 000 $. Elle n'a re\u00e7u aucun autre avantage dans cet emploi.\n[249] Ces montants devraient donc \u00eatre d\u00e9duits du montant de la perte de salaire.\n[250] Quand \u00e0 la demande pour la perte de salaire du 2 juillet 2005 au 1er mars 2006, la preuve ne permettait pas de conclure que la plaignante aurait travaill\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode. M\u00eame si on lui avait permis de rester au tableau des urgences, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qui permettrait au Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir un montant, alors le Tribunal ne rend aucune ordonnance pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n(iv) Pr\u00e9judice moral [251] Le paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que la victime a subi en raison de la pratique discriminatoire, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $.\n[252] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant toute la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte, elle s'est sentie d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9e et effray\u00e9e. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] stress\u00e9e et tr\u00e8s nerveuse. Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u l'appel l'avisant qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, elle a \u00e9valu\u00e9 sa situation de famille et a conclu qu'il lui \u00e9tait impossible de se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u la lettre l'avisant qu'on avait mis fin \u00e0 son emploi avec la Compagnie, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle a [TRADUCTION] pleur\u00e9 et [a] paniqu\u00e9. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait sous le choc et qu'elle ne pouvait pas croire ce qui lui arrivait. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la perte de sa carri\u00e8re l'avait \u00e9norm\u00e9ment affect\u00e9e.\n[253] Bien qu'aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'audience, le Tribunal conclut que le comportement et l'attitude nonchalante de la Compagnie envers la situation de la plaignante l'ont boulevers\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de payer \u00e0 la plaignante 15 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(v) Acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 [254] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire lorsque la pratique discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $.\n[255] Je conviens que le comportement de la Compagnie en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. La Compagnie poss\u00e8de une politique d'accommodement, qui \u00e9tablit les proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 suivre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui signale un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial. Cette politique a clairement cibl\u00e9 la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination. Pourtant, la Compagnie et les gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs qui ont agi dans cette affaire ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper de la situation de famille et n'ont pas tenu compte de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par la politique. Ils n'ont fait aucun effort pour essayer de comprendre la situation de la plaignante. Ils n'ont pas tenu compte de ses lettres et ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter son cas comme \u00e9tant simplement un cas de [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8me de garde d'enfants. Ils \u00e9taient d'avis qu'ils savaient, sans avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante, ce qui \u00e9tait mieux pour elle et ce dont elle avait besoin. Ces actes, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9taient inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[256] Compte tenu des circonstances, j'ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de payer \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 20 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n(vi) D\u00e9pens et int\u00e9r\u00eats. [257] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocate de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal accorde les d\u00e9pens. La question de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des d\u00e9pens et si cette comp\u00e9tence rel\u00e8ve de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, qui autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 indemniser un plaignant pour toutes les d\u00e9penses encourues en raison de l'acte discriminatoire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2009 CAF 309.\n[258] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 le Code des droits de la personne de diverses provinces, qui permettait d'accorder des d\u00e9pens, et apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu au paragraphe 95 :\nLa recherche vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le l\u00e9gislateur voulait investir le Tribunal du pouvoir d'accorder des d\u00e9pens au plaignant ayant gain de cause. Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-dessus, je conclus que le l\u00e9gislateur n'avait pas l'intention d'investir, et n'a pas investi, le Tribunal du pouvoir d'accorder des d\u00e9pens. Conclure que le Tribunal peut accorder des d\u00e9pens au titre des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte aurait pour effet d'introduire indirectement dans la Loi un pouvoir qui ne correspondait pas \u00e0 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[259] Tenant compte de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Tribunal ne peut pas accueillir la demande de la plaignante quant \u00e0 l'ordonnance que la Compagnie lui paie ses d\u00e9pens.\n[260] La plaignante et Cindy Richards ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des menues d\u00e9penses d'un montant de 336,68 $, chacune des plaignantes demandant la moiti\u00e9 de ce montant. La Compagnie n'a pas contest\u00e9 ce montant. En application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de rembourser la moiti\u00e9 du montant \u00e0 la plaignante.\n(vii) Int\u00e9r\u00eats [261] En ce qui a trait aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, ils sont exigibles pour toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP). Il s'agit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s annuellement, \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d'escompte (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP) et \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3)), les int\u00e9r\u00eats commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date de la plainte, et pour la perte de salaire, ils commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date de r\u00e9tablissement.\nSign\u00e9e par Michel Doucet OTTAWA (Ontario) Le 29 septembre 2010\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1354\/8408\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nKasha A.

INTRODUCTION [1] Il s'agit d'une plainte de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d'emploi fond\u00e9e sur les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Denise Seeley (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle elle all\u00e9guait que l'intim\u00e9e, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (la Compagnie), avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en raison de sa situation de famille en ne prenant pas de mesure d'accommodement pour elle et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[2] La Compagnie nie les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n[3] Toutes les parties, y compris la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP), \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par un avocat.\n[4] Deux autres plaintes connexes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la Compagnie. Par entente entre les parties, les deux autres cas ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s dans une audience distincte et seront tranch\u00e9es s\u00e9par\u00e9ment. Bien que les faits en l'esp\u00e8ce et ceux dans les deux autres affaires soient tr\u00e8s semblables et que les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie soient les m\u00eames, \u00e0 l'exception d'une personne qui n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e est, en de nombreux points, diff\u00e9rente. Sans n\u00e9cessairement se contredire, les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce n'ont pas r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 exactement le m\u00eame t\u00e9moignage dans les deux autres affaires. De plus, des documents qui n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience de l'esp\u00e8ce ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve dans les deux autres affaires. Ces diff\u00e9rences expliqueront toute divergence qui puisse exister dans les faits lorsqu'ils sont compar\u00e9s.\nA. LES FAITS (i) La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada a) Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [5] La Compagnie est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sous r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui tire ses revenus du transport de biens par train. Il s'agit d'une compagnie de chemins de fer transcontinentale qui op\u00e8re au Canada et aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Les trains de marchandises transportent des biens 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, 365 jours par ann\u00e9e.\n[6] La Compagnie a plus de 15 000 employ\u00e9s au Canada. Ces employ\u00e9s sont organis\u00e9s en deux groupes d\u00e9crits comme un groupe op\u00e9rationnel et un groupe non op\u00e9rationnel. Le groupe non op\u00e9rationnel est constitu\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s qui occupent des postes en administration, en m\u00e9canique et en ing\u00e9nierie. Les employ\u00e9s du groupe op\u00e9rationnel, aussi connus sous le nom de personnel des trains, sont des chefs de train et des m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives. La Compagnie compte plus de 4 000 employ\u00e9s du personnel des trains \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du Canada, dont 2 400 sont des chefs de train.\n[7] Le Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes (le CGE) \u00e0 Edmonton est une partie tr\u00e8s importante des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie. Il est responsable de tous les appels des \u00e9quipes et les d\u00e9ploiements pour la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Il g\u00e8re le d\u00e9ploiement du personnel des trains et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, dont le budget total est de 204 millions de dollars. Elaine Storms est la directrice du CGE. Elle occupait d\u00e9j\u00e0 ce poste en 2005.\nb) Le personnel des trains [8] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives et les chefs de train font partie du groupe portant le nom de personnel des trains. Les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives font fonctionner le moteur et les chefs de train sont, au fond, responsables de tous les autres aspects li\u00e9s au mouvement du train.\n[9] Le personnel des trains travaille soit sur la [TRADUCTION] route ou au [TRADUCTION] triage. Le [TRADUCTION] travail de route est effectu\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s qui embarquent dans un train \u00e0 un terminal en particulier et qui am\u00e8nent le train \u00e0 un autre terminal. Ils attendent ensuite \u00e0 ce deuxi\u00e8me terminal et reviennent plus tard \u00e0 leur terminal local. Un employ\u00e9 de triage travaille g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la gare de triage, transf\u00e9rant les wagons couverts et embo\u00eetant les trains. Un employ\u00e9 de triage n'a pas besoin de quitter le terminal.\n[10] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'embauche, la Compagnie a tendance \u00e0 embaucher son personnel des trains en groupes. La Compagnie a embauch\u00e9 beaucoup d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 70 et un peu d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 80. Elle a de nouveau embauch\u00e9 beaucoup d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 90, et de m\u00eame au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[11] Mme Ziemer, une agente des ressources humaines de la Compagnie \u00e0 Vancouver, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en 1996, le pourcentage de femmes dans le personnel des trains \u00e9tait d'environ 3 p. 100. Cette donn\u00e9e \u00e9tait de 3,7 p. 100 en 2006 et se situe maintenant \u00e0 environ 3,1 p. 100. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, principalement, les hommes montraient plus d'int\u00e9r\u00eat que les femmes envers le travail du personnel des trains.\n[12] Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que le co\u00fbt d'embauche et de formation d'un chef de train \u00e9tait d'environ 18 000 $ \u00e0 20 000 $ par chef de train. La formation prend de trois (3) \u00e0 six (6) mois. Le co\u00fbt de la formation d'un m\u00e9canicien de locomotives est d'environ 28 000 $ \u00e0 30 000 $, en plus du co\u00fbt de sa formation comme chef de train.\n[13] Afin de se qualifier pour travailler comme chef de train, un employ\u00e9 doit faire mettre \u00e0 jour sa fiche de r\u00e8gles et sa fiche m\u00e9dicale. Ces fiches doivent \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9es tous les trois ans. Si un employ\u00e9 est au tableau de service, il recevra g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un avis lui disant que ses fiches expireront bient\u00f4t et il n'a qu'\u00e0 prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour les faire mettre \u00e0 jour. Si l'employ\u00e9 est en mise \u00e0 pied, il devra le faire lui-m\u00eame.\n[14] En raison de la nature des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie, le personnel des trains doit \u00eatre disponible pour travailler \u00e0 l'endroit et au moment requis, dans le respect des restrictions impos\u00e9es par la loi et par la convention collective. Compte tenu de ces exigences, la Compagnie est d'avis que la mobilit\u00e9 et la flexibilit\u00e9 constituent des conditions d'emploi de base pour ces employ\u00e9s. Elle est d'avis que ces exigences sont n\u00e9cessaires compte tenu du volume de biens que la Compagnie transporte et de la fluctuation en mati\u00e8re de demande qui peut exister pendant une courte p\u00e9riode en raison, par exemple, de changements dans l'\u00e9conomie ou de facteurs saisonniers tels que la saison de la moisson du grain.\n[15] Lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 travaille ou est disponible pour travailler, on dit qu'il est au [TRADUCTION] tableau de service. Le tableau de service comprend tous les employ\u00e9s qui ne sont pas mis \u00e0 pied. Les employ\u00e9s qui sont au tableau de service sont soit en affectation, soit dans un bassin.\n[16] Un employ\u00e9 qui est au tableau de service peut aussi \u00eatre appel\u00e9 employ\u00e9 affect\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision d'affecter un employ\u00e9 est prise apr\u00e8s une discussion entre les gestionnaires du terminal o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 doit \u00eatre affecter et le Syndicat. Cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur le nombre d'employ\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires au terminal pour effectuer le travail pr\u00e9vu.\n[17] Il y a aussi un autre tableau, qui fait partie du tableau de service et qui porte le nom de [TRADUCTION] tableau de remplacement ou de [TRADUCTION] tableau d'urgence. Les employ\u00e9s dont le nom figure \u00e0 ce tableau sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler seulement pour remplacer des employ\u00e9s qui sont soit en vacances, soit incapables de travailler pour d'autres raisons.\n[18] Le travail du personnel des trains est fond\u00e9 sur le millage. Le tableau de service est ajust\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on hebdomadaire afin que chaque employ\u00e9 puisse faire environ 4 300 milles par mois. Lorsque la Compagnie ajuste le tableau de service, elle examine les donn\u00e9es de la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente afin de voir combien de milles les employ\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9s. Elle divise ce nombre par 4 300 et le r\u00e9sultat indique le nombre d'employ\u00e9s qui serait probablement n\u00e9cessaire dans un terminal en particulier la semaine suivante.\n[19] Pendant toutes les p\u00e9riodes en cause, les chefs de train dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest du Canada \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les Travailleurs unis du transport (le Syndicat). La r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest comprend tous les terminaux ferroviaires de la Compagnie \u00e0 partir de Vancouver (Colombie-Britannique) jusqu'\u00e0 Thunder Bay (Ontario). La convention collective applicable aux chefs de train dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest est la convention collective 4.3 (la convention collective).\nc) Les changements effectu\u00e9s en 1992 et la cr\u00e9ation du tableau de cong\u00e9s [20] En 1992, des changements dans la technologie ont permis \u00e0 la Compagnie d'\u00e9liminer le wagon \u00e0 la fin du train, qui est commun\u00e9ment connu sous le nom de wagon de queue. Cette d\u00e9cision a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'\u00e9limination du poste de serre-frein. Apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision, les chefs de train qui travaillaient dans le wagon de queue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avant du train avec les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives. L'\u00e9limination du poste de serre-frein signifiait que la Compagnie avait besoin de moins de personnel des trains pour faire fonctionner ses trains. La r\u00e9duction dans le nombre d'employ\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e pendant le processus de n\u00e9gociation avec le Syndicat. La n\u00e9gociation a entra\u00een\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation du [TRADUCTION] tableau de cong\u00e9s.\n[21] Un tableau de cong\u00e9s est cr\u00e9\u00e9 lorsqu'il y a un surplus d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 un terminal, mais pas suffisamment de travail pour tous. Le tableau de cong\u00e9 garantit \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 un salaire \u00e9quivalent \u00e0 celui qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 en travaillant, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence des 4 300 milles de d\u00e9placement pr\u00e9vus par la convention collective, qu'il ait travaill\u00e9 ou non. L'employ\u00e9 dont le nom figure au tableau de cong\u00e9s doit rester disponible pour le travail, mais s'il n'est pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler, il re\u00e7oit tout de m\u00eame son salaire.\n[22] Les changements effectu\u00e9s aux conditions de travail en 1992 ont aussi cr\u00e9\u00e9 la notion de [TRADUCTION] for\u00e7age, qui produit diff\u00e9rents r\u00e9sultats pour diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories d'employ\u00e9s dans le personnel des trains. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 148.11 de la convention collective, les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 29 juin 1990 peuvent \u00eatre forc\u00e9s de travailler dans un autre terminal dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest et ont l'obligation de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce terminal au plus tard dans les trente (30) jours suivant l'appel, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne pr\u00e9sentent une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier le fait qu'ils ne se pr\u00e9senteront pas. Ces employ\u00e9s sont commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie D. Ils sont aussi appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, parce qu'ils ont l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel au travail \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de leur terminal.\n[23] L'autre cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s comprend les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant le 29 juin 1990. Ces employ\u00e9s sont appel\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Dans ce groupe d'employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, on retrouve ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant 1982 et qui portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie A et de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie B, respectivement. Ces employ\u00e9s ne peuvent pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail ailleurs qu'\u00e0 leur terminal local. Les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 1982, mais avant le 29 juin 1990, portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie C et peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail \u00e0 des terminaux adjacents. Par exemple, les employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie C du terminal de Jasper peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s aux terminaux adjacents d'Edson et de Kamloops.\n[24] Le statut d'employ\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le nombre de ces employ\u00e9s diminuera au cours des ann\u00e9es simplement par l'attrition, et le statut dispara\u00eetra \u00e9ventuellement compl\u00e8tement. Les employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s ont aussi l'avantage de s'inscrire au tableau de cong\u00e9s. Les employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s ne peuvent pas s'inscrire au tableau de cong\u00e9s.\n[25] \u00c0 la suite de la cr\u00e9ation du tableau de cong\u00e9s, qui essentiellement permet \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s d'\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 leur terminal local, la Compagnie devait trouver une fa\u00e7on de combler des postes en cas de p\u00e9nuries dans d'autres terminaux. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que la clause 148.11 de la convention collective est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. C'est cette disposition, comme nous venons de le voir, qui permet \u00e0 la Compagnie de forcer les employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 se rendre dans d'autres terminaux de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour couvrir les p\u00e9nuries.\n[26] Avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la clause 148.11, la Compagnie obtenait des employ\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie en produisant des TRADUCTION bulletins de p\u00e9nurie et en permettant aux employ\u00e9s de se porter volontaires en cas de p\u00e9nurie, s'ils le d\u00e9siraient. Ces bulletins \u00e9taient produits \u00e0 chaque [TRADUCTION] changement de fiche, soit environ quatre fois par ann\u00e9e. Comme il est difficile pour la Compagnie de pr\u00e9voir o\u00f9 une p\u00e9nurie aura lieu, ces bulletins couvraient divers endroits, qu'il y ait r\u00e9ellement une p\u00e9nurie ou non. Les employ\u00e9s qui souhaitaient r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie dans un certain endroit se portaient volontaires pour cet endroit, et s'il y avait une p\u00e9nurie au terminal en question, l'employ\u00e9 qui s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9 volontaire \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 aller y travailler.\n[27] La Compagnie affiche toujours des bulletins de p\u00e9nurie, et les employ\u00e9s peuvent toujours se porter volontaires suivant ces bulletins, mais comme les employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s peuvent maintenant rester \u00e0 leur terminal local, au tableau de cong\u00e9s, et tout de m\u00eame recevoir leur salaire, ils n'ont gu\u00e8re d'avantage \u00e0 se porter volontaires en cas de p\u00e9nurie.\n[28] La Compagnie utilise aussi un syst\u00e8me connu sous le nom de [TRADUCTION] dotation suivant le tableau de remplacement ( en anglais, whitemanning ), qui lui permet d'envoyer les employ\u00e9s en surplus dans un terminal \u00e0 un terminal adjacent. Par exemple, dans un tel sc\u00e9nario, des employ\u00e9s de Kamloops (C.-B.) conduiraient des trains que les \u00e9quipes de Vancouver conduisent normalement jusqu'\u00e0 Kamloops.\n[29] Il est aussi possible qu'on demande \u00e0 des gestionnaires de travailler pendant une situation de p\u00e9nurie. Presque tous les gestionnaires des transports sont qualifi\u00e9s pour conduire des trains. La Compagnie demandera aux gestionnaires de conduire des trains en dernier recours, lorsqu'elle aura \u00e9puis\u00e9 le personnel des trains.\n[30] Les employ\u00e9s qui sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 un autre terminal en vertu de la clause 148.11 de la convention collective ont droit \u00e0 certaines commodit\u00e9s au terminal qui leur est assign\u00e9. Ces commodit\u00e9s comprennent, lorsqu'elles sont disponibles, des chambres \u00e9quip\u00e9es d'une cuisinette et aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de retourner \u00e0 la maison \u00e0 des intervalles r\u00e9guliers ou, subsidiairement, la possibilit\u00e9 que la Compagnie d\u00e9fraie le co\u00fbt associ\u00e9 au transport d'un membre de la famille jusqu'au lieu de la p\u00e9nurie.\n[31] L'alin\u00e9a 148.11f) de la convention collective stipule que le premier employ\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie sera l'employ\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 le moins ancien qui est en mise \u00e0 pied dans le territoire d'anciennet\u00e9 et dont la date d'anciennet\u00e9 est ult\u00e9rieure au 29 juin 1990. La convention collective ne pr\u00e9voit pas de dur\u00e9e maximale pour la couverture d'une p\u00e9nurie. Si la p\u00e9nurie devient permanente, la Compagnie embauchera alors des employ\u00e9s pour le lieu touch\u00e9.\n[32] La clause 115 de la convention collective stipule qu'un employ\u00e9 qui est mis \u00e0 pied sera prioritaire pour le r\u00e9emploi si l'effectif est augment\u00e9 dans son district de s\u00e9niorit\u00e9 et qu'il reprendra du service par ordre d'anciennet\u00e9. Cette clause stipule aussi que si l'employ\u00e9 travaille ailleurs au moment du rappel, il peut obtenir trente (30) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail. S'il ne se pr\u00e9sente pas au travail ou qu'il ne donne pas de [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter, dans les quinze (15) jours suivant le rappel, il renonce \u00e0 ses droits d'anciennet\u00e9.\n[33] Un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite soulever une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter au travail doit d'abord pr\u00e9senter sa demande au Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes (le CGE). On lui donne alors l'instruction d'\u00e9crire une lettre \u00e0 son superviseur imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 son terminal local. Si la raison soulev\u00e9e peut avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la convention collective, il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de discuter avec le Syndicat.\n(ii) Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail de la plaignante [34] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par la Compagnie comme serre-freins le 2 juin 1991 et elle s'est qualifi\u00e9e comme chef de train en 1993. Son terminal local \u00e9tait celui de Jasper (Alberta). La plaignante et son mari habitaient \u00e0 Jasper jusqu'\u00e0 la naissance de leur premier enfant en 1999. Ils ont ensuite d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Brule (Alberta), une petite communaut\u00e9 situ\u00e9e \u00e0 environ quatre-vingt dix-huit (98) kilom\u00e8tres de Jasper. La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e par la Compagnie jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'elle soit cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en 2005 parce qu'elle avait refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver.\n[35] Son mari est aussi un employ\u00e9 de la Compagnie \u00e0 titre de m\u00e9canicien de locomotives et a actuellement 32 ann\u00e9es de service.\n[36] La demanderesse a travaill\u00e9 comme chef de train de 1991 \u00e0 1997. En 1997, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied, comme de nombreux autres employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie. Elle est rest\u00e9e en mise \u00e0 pied de novembre 1997 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Cependant, sa relation d'emploi avec la Compagnie a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue tout au long de la p\u00e9riode de mise \u00e0 pied. La convention collective stipule qu'un employ\u00e9 en mise \u00e0 pied continue d'accumuler de l'anciennet\u00e9. Elle stipule aussi que l'employ\u00e9 peut rester en mise \u00e0 pied ind\u00e9finiment ou jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il soit rappel\u00e9 ou qu'il d\u00e9missionne.\n[37] Entre 1997 et 2001, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 pour la Compagnie en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 des appels d'urgence. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle a effectu\u00e9 vingt-cinq (25) tours de service d'urgence entre 1997 et 2000. En 2001, elle a effectu\u00e9 quatre (4) tours de plus. Elle n'a plus travaill\u00e9 apr\u00e8s 2001.\n[38] En janvier 1999, le premier enfant du couple est n\u00e9. Le deuxi\u00e8me enfant est n\u00e9 en 2003. Apr\u00e8s la naissance de son premier enfant, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 en fonction du tableau d'urgences quelques fois, \u00e0 Jasper, mais comme les appels \u00e9taient impr\u00e9visibles, il \u00e9tait difficile pour elle de prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour prendre soin de son enfant. Apr\u00e8s la naissance de son deuxi\u00e8me enfant, la plaignante n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 des urgences pour la Compagnie.\n(iii) La p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver [39] En f\u00e9vrier 2005, la Compagnie subissait une importante p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 son terminal de Vancouver. Cette situation \u00e9tait due principalement \u00e0 la croissance de l'\u00e9conomie et \u00e0 l'augmentation du volume d'activit\u00e9s de la Compagnie, qui avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir suffisamment de personnel des trains localement. Selon Mme Storms, soixante-douze (72) chefs de train \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie et il n'y avait que cinquante-trois (53) chefs de train sur place. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'[TRADUCTION] il s'agissait incontestablement de l'une des p\u00e9nuries les plus importantes que j'aie vues dans ma carri\u00e8re.\n[40] En raison de son emplacement, le terminal de Vancouver est tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9. Il comprend une importante gare de triage et des op\u00e9rations intermodales o\u00f9 les biens sont transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de navires et vers les navires. Le terminal de Vancouver constitue par cons\u00e9quent un centre de liaison pour le march\u00e9 canadien de la Compagnie, parce qu'une grande quantit\u00e9 de mat\u00e9riaux et de biens de consommation provenant de l'Asie et de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, et export\u00e9s vers l'Asie et l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, passe par Vancouver et est ensuite transport\u00e9e partout au Canada sur le r\u00e9seau ferroviaire de la Compagnie.\n[41] Une p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 Vancouver a d'importantes r\u00e9percussions, car elle peut avoir des incidences sur la capacit\u00e9 de la Compagnie \u00e0 fonctionner ad\u00e9quatement partout dans son r\u00e9seau.\n[42] Afin de maintenir son niveau d'op\u00e9ration, la Compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2005 de rappeler des chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie qui touchait le terminal de Vancouver. Ces employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dont la date d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait ult\u00e9rieure au 29 juin 1990. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils \u00e9taient vis\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 148.11c) de la convention collective.\n[43] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle s'\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 Vancouver pour aider \u00e0 l'affectation des agents. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que des gestionnaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s de partout au Canada pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n[44] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e possible de cette p\u00e9nurie, M. Joe Torchia, le directeur des relations de travail de la Compagnie, a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il aurait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'\u00e9tablir une estimation, mais que la Compagnie aurait h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire [TRADUCTION] parce que les gens s'attendent \u00e0 ce que cette date soit respect\u00e9e. Il a reconnu que l'incertitude au sujet de la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9nurie pouvait avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur le type d'h\u00e9bergement que la Compagnie pourrait accepter de payer. Mme Storms a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus pr\u00e9cise et a expliqu\u00e9 que, si la plaignante s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver, elle y serait probablement rest\u00e9e pendant environ un an, parce que la situation de p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue avant 2006.\n[45] Les employ\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9sentaient au terminal de Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie devaient se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la gare de triage Thornton, \u00e0 Surrey, et de l\u00e0, comme Vancouver avait beaucoup de gares de triage, ils \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s aux endroits o\u00f9 leurs services \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Les employ\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient inform\u00e9s de l'endroit o\u00f9 ils allaient travailler et du quart de travail qu'ils allaient occuper que lorsqu'ils arrivaient \u00e0 Vancouver.\n(iv) Les chefs de train qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver [46] Quarante-sept (47) chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver en f\u00e9vrier 2005. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective, les employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9, en commen\u00e7ant par la personne avec le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 dans le district. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie ne permettait pas \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui avait de l'anciennet\u00e9 de refuser une occasion de travailler, parce que cela signifierait qu'il ne prot\u00e9geait pas son anciennet\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque du rappel, la plaignante \u00e9tait la troisi\u00e8me personne sur les quatre figurant \u00e0 la liste d'anciennet\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied au terminal de Jasper.\n[47] Les quarante-sept (47) employ\u00e9s ont d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 joints par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Selon Mme Storms, lorsque ces employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s, on leur a dit qu'ils avaient quinze (15) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n[48] La Compagnie a produit \u00e0 l'audience un document qui \u00e9tablissait une partie des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de travail pour certains de ces employ\u00e9s. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que ce document \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat de renseignements que les r\u00e9partiteurs d'\u00e9quipes du CGE ont \u00e9crits dans le syst\u00e8me. Les avocats de la plaignante et de la CCDP ont longuement contre-interrog\u00e9 Mme Storms au sujet de ce document. J'examinerai ce document en d\u00e9tail dans les paragraphes suivants, puisqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vident que les renseignements qu'il contient \u00e9taient importants pour toutes les parties. Afin de prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s, ils seront identifi\u00e9s par des lettres qui ne correspondent pas \u00e0 leurs noms r\u00e9els.\n[49] L'employ\u00e9 AB, bien qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9, ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour combler la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Le 22 mars 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au terminal de Sioux Lookout. Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 y travailler jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'avait pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. Bien que cet employ\u00e9 e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 le 22 mars, il a seulement travaill\u00e9 le 24 mars et ensuite, il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 1er avril. Apr\u00e8s cette date, il a travaill\u00e9 le 10 et le 11 avril, mais n'a plus travaill\u00e9 avant le 18 avril. Le 22 juillet, il a pris un cong\u00e9 et n'est retourn\u00e9 au travail que le 12 ao\u00fbt. Il a travaill\u00e9 de cette date jusqu'au 20 ao\u00fbt, mais il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cette date jusqu'au 22 septembre. Il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau le 30 septembre, puis n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 28 octobre.\n[50] L'employ\u00e9 HI travaillait dans une p\u00e9riode de p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne au moment du rappel. Il a travaill\u00e9 dans le cadre de cette p\u00e9nurie jusqu'au 18 mai 2005. Apr\u00e8s cela, il est rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison pendant une semaine, puis s'est rendu \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie le 30 mai. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 19 septembre 2005. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Francis le 29 octobre et y a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[51] Selon les documents produits par la Compagnie, alors qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 Vancouver, cet employ\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 par effectuer quatre (4) tours de formation. Apr\u00e8s la fin de sa formation le 3 juin, il a seulement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 9 juin, soit six jours plus tard. Mme Storms a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible que pendant ce temps, il \u00e9tait toujours en formation, bien qu'elle ne puisse pas en \u00eatre certaine. Apr\u00e8s le 9 juin, il est inscrit comme \u00e9tant disponible du 17 juin jusqu'au 26 juin, puis il est inscrit qu'il \u00e9tait en millage. Cela signifie qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au lieu de la p\u00e9nurie pendant un certain temps et qu'il pouvait retourner \u00e0 la maison pendant quelques jours. Il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver du 16 juin au 6 juillet. Il n'a pas non plus travaill\u00e9 du 23 juillet au 8 ao\u00fbt. Il a eu un autre cong\u00e9 le 1er septembre et sa prochaine date de travail \u00e9tait le 25 septembre. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le 29 octobre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Francis, mais il n'y a r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 partir du 22 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi un employ\u00e9 serait affect\u00e9 pendant presque deux mois sans travailler, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Je ne peux pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question.\n[52] L'employ\u00e9 P a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 North Battleford le 25 f\u00e9vrier. Le 19 mars, il a pris une semaine de vacances puis il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 26 mars. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est affect\u00e9, il n'a plus l'obligation d'aller r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Mme Storms a cependant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le fait d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 ne signifie pas qu'un employ\u00e9 travaille tous les jours. Dans le cas de l'employ\u00e9 P, par exemple, du 26 mars jusqu'\u00e0 la fin avril, il a seulement travaill\u00e9 sept jours \u00e0 son terminal local, mais Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'il faut \u00eatre prudent en examinant cette information, parce que les tours peuvent durer deux (2) ou trois (3) jours chacun, bien qu'aucune preuve confirmant que c'\u00e9tait le cas pour cet employ\u00e9 n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. L'employ\u00e9 a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied le 24 avril 2005. De cette date jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e, cet employ\u00e9 s'est d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans la zone de la Saskatchewan [TRADUCTION] occupant des postes ouverts dans d'autres terminaux.\n[53] L'expression [TRADUCTION] occuper des postes ouverts fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la situation o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied qui a de l'anciennet\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest choisit de se rendre \u00e0 un autre terminal o\u00f9 un poste qu'il peut occuper est vacant. Lorsqu'un poste devient disponible \u00e0 son terminal local, l'employ\u00e9 y retourne. Si un employ\u00e9 exerce son droit d'anciennet\u00e9 et [TRADUCTION] occupe un poste ouvert, il compte comme un employ\u00e9 qui travaille et il n'a pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Selon Mme Storms, cela aurait pu \u00eatre une option pour la plaignante. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que, pour que la plaignante puisse le faire, elle aurait eu \u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner au CGE et demander si elle pouvait occuper un poste ouvert.\n[54] L'employ\u00e9 Y a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Ce jour-l\u00e0, il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9, mais selon Mme Storms, le CGE aurait communiqu\u00e9 avec lui dans les jours suivants. Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait examin\u00e9 le dossier de travail de cet employ\u00e9 et qu'il y \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] absent sans permission le 4 mars 2005 et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9. Cependant, elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] Je ne connais pas les d\u00e9tails, mais je crois qu'il y a eu une erreur et qu'il aurait d\u00fb simplement \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Peu importe ce qui est arriv\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9 n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie et il a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 15 mars 2005. Le 9 avril, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied, puis, le 30 avril, il a obtenu un cong\u00e9 de son coordonnateur des trains. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec son coordonnateur des trains et le surintendant de sa division pour savoir pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 avait obtenu un cong\u00e9, mais le coordonnateur des trains avait pris sa retraite et il n'y avait aucun document au sujet de cette situation \u00e0 la Division. Elle a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le surintendant ne se souvenait pas de la situation. Mme Storms a aussi ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Nous avons eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 rejoindre l'employ\u00e9 et, honn\u00eatement, il nous \u00e9vitait. Il a travaill\u00e9 la majorit\u00e9 du temps \u00e0 son terminal local. Il a travaill\u00e9, a \u00e9t\u00e9 en formation ou a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 pendant la majorit\u00e9 de la p\u00e9nurie. Enfin, le 25 d\u00e9cembre 2005, cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon.\n[55] L'employ\u00e9 U a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver au m\u00eame moment que tous les autres. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait personnellement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 et qu'il l'avait avis\u00e9e que son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait en phase terminale. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait pris la d\u00e9cision elle-m\u00eame de prolonger le temps qui lui \u00e9tait accord\u00e9 pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Cet employ\u00e9 est rest\u00e9 sur le tableau des mises \u00e0 pied jusqu'au 26 juin 2005, auquel moment il a obtenu un cong\u00e9 du coordonnateur des trains de son terminal. Le 24 juillet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local. Son p\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en octobre et il a pris un cong\u00e9 de deuil. Il est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local pour le restant de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[56] Mme Storms a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9part, lorsque les employ\u00e9s du CGE ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec les employ\u00e9s, ils \u00e9crivaient des notes dans leurs dossiers de travail alors qu'ils effectuaient les appels. Cependant, comme la p\u00e9nurie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s importante, les proc\u00e9dures devenaient un peu [TRADUCTION] compliqu\u00e9es et Mme Storms a avis\u00e9 ses employ\u00e9s de pr\u00e9parer des tableaux afin de voir comment les choses se d\u00e9roulaient et combien de personnes couvriraient la p\u00e9nurie. Les renseignements qui se trouvent sur ces tableaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis et inscrits par diff\u00e9rents employ\u00e9s du CGE. Le premier tableau a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit le 7 mars 2005.\n[57] L'inscription sur les feuilles de calcul pour le 16 mars 2005 indique que l'employ\u00e9 E avait [TRADUCTION] 15 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter, 30 jours demand\u00e9s. G. Spanos, confirmer ou organiser le d\u00e9placement. Le 20 avril 2005, il est inscrit [TRADUCTION] Dans la zone du Manitoba [E] a obtenu un cong\u00e9 de compassion jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre - accord\u00e9 par Ron Smith - pour des raisons personnelles . Selon Mme Storms, Ron Smith est le gestionnaire du personnel des trains pour la zone du Manitoba. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle se souvenait [TRADUCTION] un peu de ce cas. La situation \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 celle de l'employ\u00e9 U. L'employ\u00e9 E avait aussi un parent en phase terminale. Le 19 mai 2005, l'inscription pour cet employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9cisait : [TRADUCTION] Dans la zone du Manitoba, cette personne a obtenu un [cong\u00e9 de compassion] jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman et K. Carroll. M. Carroll \u00e9tait le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Vancouver, division sud, et M. Nashman \u00e9tait le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Centre d'op\u00e9ration de l'Ouest. L'employ\u00e9 E a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 jusqu'au 30 juillet 2005 et a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 absent sans permission du 31 juillet au 8 septembre. Le 10 septembre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre terminal (Brandon (Manitoba)) et, finalement, il a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 le 19 octobre.\n(v) Le rappel au travail de la plaignante [58] Le 25 f\u00e9vier 2005, la plaignante a re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique d'un employ\u00e9 non-identifi\u00e9 du CGE \u00e0 Edmonton. Cet employ\u00e9 lui a demand\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Si la Compagnie vous affectait, combien de temps auriez-vous besoin pour vous pr\u00e9senter au travail?. Elle a r\u00e9pondu que cela d\u00e9pendait de la question de savoir si elle \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper o\u00f9 si elle serait envoy\u00e9e ailleurs. Selon son souvenir, comme elle l'a \u00e9crit dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 4 mars 2005 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 C. Pizziol, le coordonnateur des trains au terminal de Jasper, l'employ\u00e9 du CGE lui avait r\u00e9pondu qu'[TRADUCTION] il \u00e9tait peu probable qu'elle soit envoy\u00e9e ailleurs parce que tous les terminaux sont en p\u00e9nurie, y compris celui de Jasper. Dans ce cas, elle croyait qu'elle aurait probablement besoin de quelques semaines pour trouver une solution pour la garde de ses deux enfants. La Compagnie n'a pas contest\u00e9 ce t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante.\n[59] \u00c0 part la directrice Elaine Storms, aucun employ\u00e9 du CGE n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Elaine Storms n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de cette conversation entre la plaignante et l'employ\u00e9 non-identifi\u00e9 du CGE.\n[60] Le lendemain, le 26 f\u00e9vrier 2005, Joe Lyons, gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations au CGE pour les op\u00e9rations de l'Ouest, a discut\u00e9 par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec le mari de la plaignante. Il l'a avis\u00e9 que la plaignante devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie, en application des stipulations de la convention collective.\n[61] Joe Lyons, qui travaillait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque pour Mme Storms, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Sauf le fait qu'il ne travaille plus pour la Compagnie, aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e pour son absence.\n[62] La Compagnie a aussi produit \u00e0 l'audience une lettre que Joe Lyons a envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2005, dans laquelle il a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Pour faire suite \u00e0 l'appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 25 f\u00e9vrier 2005, vous rappelant au service de la Compagnie, vous \u00eates rappel\u00e9e au tableau de service imm\u00e9diatement, en application de la clause 115 de la convention 4.3. Il existe aussi \u00e0 Vancouver une p\u00e9nurie qui force la Compagnie \u00e0 invoquer les clauses 89.10 et 148.11c) de la convention 4.3. Ces clauses stipulent que les employ\u00e9s non-prot\u00e9g\u00e9s doivent r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries dans leur territoire d'anciennet\u00e9. En application de cette clause, vous devez r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s de triage \u00e0 Vancouver . La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u cette lettre. La lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ancienne adresse de la plaignante \u00e0 Jasper, o\u00f9 elle n'habitait plus.\n[63] La plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 qu'avant le rappel de 2005, elle n'avait jamais refus\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 un autre lieu de travail pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie, mais que sa situation de famille avait chang\u00e9 et que c'\u00e9tait alors plus difficile pour elle de le faire. Dans sa lettre du 4 mars 2005 \u00e0 M. Pizziol, elle a expliqu\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Je suis dans une position tr\u00e8s difficile. J'ai deux enfants : un de l'\u00e2ge de 6 ans qui fr\u00e9quente la maternelle dans une \u00e9cole d'immersion fran\u00e7aise \u00e0 Hinton, et l'autre de l'\u00e2ge de 21 mois. Nous habitons dans un hameau, Brule, de moins de 180 habitants situ\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 40 km de Hinton. Nous n'avons aucune famille imm\u00e9diate \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 pour nous aider \u00e0 prendre soin des enfants. Il n'y a aucune garderie enregistr\u00e9e \u00e0 Brule. Il y a une garderie \u00e0 Hinton, cependant, elle suit les heures normales d'ouverture. Mon mari est aussi un cheminot qui, comme vous le savez, doit travailler \u00e0 toutes les heures du jour ou de la nuit et peut \u00eatre parti de 15 \u00e0 24 heures. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a demand\u00e9 une prorogation de d\u00e9lai de 30 jours [TRADUCTION] pour examiner les options qui peuvent exister.\n[64] M. Pizziol n'a jamais r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette lettre. M. Pizziol n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience et aucune explication n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e pour son absence, sauf le fait qu'il ne travaille plus pour la Compagnie.\n[65] Le 7 mars 2005, la plaignante a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Pizziol pour effectuer un suivi et lui a laiss\u00e9 un message dans lequel elle expliquait sa situation de famille et les difficult\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 la garde de ses enfants. Le m\u00eame jour, elle a \u00e9crit au pr\u00e9sident local du Syndicat pour l'aviser de la lettre qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 son superviseur, dans laquelle elle demandait une prorogation de d\u00e9lai de trente (30) jours. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] il s'agit d'une situation probl\u00e9matique pour moi et je n'ai pas beaucoup d'options, compte tenu de ma jeune famille, de la carri\u00e8re de cheminot de [mon mari] et de l'endroit o\u00f9 nous habitons.\n[66] Le 26 mars 2005, elle a de nouveau \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Pizziol pour lui demander de tenir compte de sa situation de famille. Elle a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu'elle avait \u00e9crit dans sa lettre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, l'avisant qu'il lui serait difficile d'amener ses enfants avec elle \u00e0 Vancouver et qu'en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s parentales, il n'\u00e9tait pas non plus possible pour elle de laisser ses enfants avec leur p\u00e8re, dont les obligations de travail lui causeraient les m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes de services de garde. Elle a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que sa situation soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une question de compassion, en application de la convention collective, et qu'on lui permette d'attendre que la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e ou qu'il y ait du travail pour elle au terminal de Jasper ou au terminal adjacent d'Edson. Une copie de cette lettre a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Storms. La plaignante n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre.\n[67] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de cette lettre. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que si elle avait re\u00e7u la lettre, sachant que M. Lyon [TRADUCTION] \u00e9tait \u00e0 la barre du dossier, elle la lui aurait transf\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[68] Dans le dernier paragraphe de la lettre, il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] On ne peut pas s'attendre \u00e0 ce que je chamboule ma famille et la d\u00e9m\u00e9nage pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, sur un coup de t\u00eate. Dans le pass\u00e9, des employ\u00e9s qui avaient des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 ont pu \u00eatre accommod\u00e9s afin de garder un poste r\u00e9gulier au triage, c'est-\u00e0-dire des employ\u00e9s diab\u00e9tiques, lorsque leur anciennet\u00e9 ne leur permettait pas d'effectuer un autre type de travail dans le terminal, plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre relocalis\u00e9s de force \u00e0 un terminal o\u00f9 ils pouvaient travailler. Est-il raisonnable de demander qu'on fasse preuve du m\u00eame \u00e9gard envers les parents de jeunes enfants, lorsqu'ils en d\u00e9montrent le besoin. Il \u00e9tait ensuite \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Je vous demande d'examiner ma situation en faisant preuve de compassion. En contre-interrogatoire, l'avocat de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Storms si cela lui avait indiqu\u00e9 que la plaignante demandait des mesures d'accommodement pour sa situation de famille. Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Non. Je n'aurais pas vu la question sous cet angle. Lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 demande un cong\u00e9, il doit en parler \u00e0 son propre superviseur. Le superviseur peut avoir discut\u00e9 avec les ressources humaines, qui s'occupent de ce genre de question. La plupart de nos employ\u00e9s, ou une grande partie de nos employ\u00e9s, ont des enfants et il n'\u00e9tait pas fr\u00e9quent qu'un employ\u00e9 demande \u00e0 \u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Je me serais attendue \u00e0 ce que M. Pizziol communique avec les ressources humaines au sujet d'une telle question. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Aucune preuve donnant \u00e0 penser que M. Pizziol a communiqu\u00e9 avec les ressources humaines au sujet de la situation de la plaignante n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\n[69] Le 29 mars 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Joe Lyons et \u00e0 envoy\u00e9 une copie conforme de sa lettre \u00e0 M. Pizziol et \u00e0 Mme Storms. Dans cette lettre, elle a \u00e9crit qu'elle n'avait pas re\u00e7u d'avis \u00e9crit l'informant qu'elle devait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver, alors que d'autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper avaient re\u00e7u un tel avis. Le m\u00eame jour, elle a aussi envoy\u00e9 une lettre \u00e0 Mme Storms lui demandant de reconsid\u00e9rer sa situation.\n[70] Joe Lyons a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante le 30 mars 2005. Dans cette lettre, il avisait la plaignante que sa demande de prorogation de d\u00e9lai de trente (30) jours avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie et que la date \u00e0 laquelle elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9plac\u00e9e au 29 mars. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u cette lettre. La lettre mentionnait aussi une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qui aurait eu lieu le 30 mars 2005 entre la plaignante et Joe Lyons. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas du tout d'une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qui aurait eu lieu \u00e0 cette date.\n[71] Le 27 avril 2005, Joe Lyon a de nouveau \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la plaignante pour l'aviser que la Compagnie avait pris des mesures d'accommodement en lui accordant plus de temps pour examiner ses options et [TRADUCTION] prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour la garde de [ses] enfants. Il a poursuivi sa lettre en d\u00e9clarant que, bien que la Compagnie reconnaissait que ses [TRADUCTION] [pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la] garde de [ses] enfants sont des responsabilit\u00e9s personnelles importantes, elle avait l'obligation envers la Compagnie de [TRADUCTION] g\u00e9rer ces obligations personnelles de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 \u00eatre en mesure de respecter les obligations d'emploi et les obligations pr\u00e9vues par la convention collective. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u cette lettre. L'adresse sur la lettre n'\u00e9tait pas la bonne. La Compagnie a reconnu que la lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e au CGE et qu'elle portait le tampon [TRADUCTION] non-r\u00e9clam\u00e9e de Postes Canada. La lettre n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[72] Dans sa lettre du 4 mars 2005, la plaignante avait demand\u00e9 une prorogation de d\u00e9lai de trente (30) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail. Selon la Compagnie, la convention collective pr\u00e9voit une telle prorogation de d\u00e9lai lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 travaille ailleurs au moment o\u00f9 il est rappel\u00e9 au travail par la Compagnie. Ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de la plaignante. Malgr\u00e9 la disposition de la convention collective, au cours d'une r\u00e9union en mai 2005 entre les agents de la Compagnie et les repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat, la Compagnie a avis\u00e9 le Syndicat qu'elle prorogerait au 30 juin 2005 le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente au travail.\n[73] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire qu'il a eu une discussion, au mois de mai 2005, avec le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Syndicat au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 de proroger le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Cette discussion a eu lieu \u00e0 Edmonton, au cours d'une r\u00e9union dont l'ordre du jour comprenait divers points. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne se souvenait pas s'il avait pris des notes durant la r\u00e9union ou si des notes ou des courriels avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par la suite. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait le [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9cideur en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si une prorogation serait accord\u00e9e.\n[74] Le 20 juin 2005, L. Gallegos, gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie au CGE pour les op\u00e9rations de l'Ouest, qui avait alors pris le poste de M. Lyons, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante pour l'aviser que la Compagnie avait pris des mesures d'accommodement en lui accordant plus de temps pour examiner ses options et pour prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires quant \u00e0 la garde de ses enfants. La Compagnie demandait que la plaignante l'avise au plus tard le 30 juin 2005 si elle comptait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie et l'a aussi inform\u00e9e que, si elle ne s'y pr\u00e9sentait pas, elle renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9 et elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, en application de la clause 148.11 de la convention collective. La lettre comprenait aussi le paragraphe suivant :\n[TRADUCTION]\nBien que la Compagnie reconnaisse que la garde de vos enfants est une responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle importante, vous devez aussi reconna\u00eetre que votre obligation envers la Compagnie est de g\u00e9rer ces obligations personnelles de telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00eatre aussi en mesure de satisfaire \u00e0 vos obligations d'emploi et aux obligations pr\u00e9vues par la convention collective.\n[75] Le 27 juin 2005, la plaignante a re\u00e7u une autre lettre de Mme Gallegos l'avisant que son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver le jour m\u00eame signifierait qu'elle renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9 et qu'elle serait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en date du 2 juillet 2005, \u00e0 midi, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective.\n[76] Mme Gallegos n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l'audience, et la Compagnie n'a pas donn\u00e9 d'explication quant \u00e0 son absence.\n[77] Le 27 juin 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Mme Gallegos dans laquelle elle pr\u00e9cisait :\n[TRADUCTION]\nVous n'avez pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ma lettre du 26 mars 2005, dans laquelle j'\u00e9tablissais clairement ma position et ma suggestion \u00e0 la Compagnie qui aurait r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la situation. Je n'ai pas demand\u00e9 une prorogation de d\u00e9lai pour prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour la garde de mes enfants, comme vous semblez l'indiquer dans votre lettre. Vous laissez aussi entendre dans votre lettre que je n'ai pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la Compagnie si j'avais l'intention de me pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. J'ai donn\u00e9 cette r\u00e9ponse dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 mars au superviseur de la Compagnie (\u00e0 Jasper), C. Pizziol.\nE. Storms a aussi re\u00e7u une copie de la lettre que j'ai envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 J. Lyons, dans laquelle je demandais \u00e0 recevoir l'avis \u00e9crit du rappel qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 aux autres employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s. J'attends depuis une d\u00e9cision ou une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 mes demandes et, \u00e0 ce jour, je n'en ai pas eu. Le seul courrier que j'ai re\u00e7u \u00e9tait votre lettre, dans laquelle vous me menaciez de mettre fin \u00e0 mon emploi aupr\u00e8s de la Compagnie. La gestion du CGE ignore mes lettres et agit comme si elles n'existaient pas. Ce refus de reconna\u00eetre mes demandes, les appels t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques persistants au cours desquels on m'avise que je dois me pr\u00e9senter au travail ou risquer de perdre mon anciennet\u00e9, ainsi que les r\u00e9ponses \u00e9vasives qu'on me sert constituent du harc\u00e8lement et je demande \u00e0 ce que cela cesse.\nDepuis la date \u00e0 laquelle j'ai envoy\u00e9 ces lettres en mars, peu apr\u00e8s mon \u00e9valuation m\u00e9dicale chez Medisys, j'ai subi une blessure \u00e0 la colonne vert\u00e9brale, qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la fracture d'une vert\u00e8bre, et je suis pr\u00e9sentement en cours de r\u00e9tablissement. Je ne peux pas du tout travailler pour le moment. Je n'ai pas avis\u00e9 le CGE, parce que j'attendais une r\u00e9ponse de la Compagnie \u00e0 savoir si ma demande de rester en mise \u00e0 pied pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire serait accept\u00e9e.\nComme j'ai de nouveau r\u00e9pondu en temps opportun, avant le dernier d\u00e9lai que vous m'avez impos\u00e9, j'esp\u00e8re que vous ferez de m\u00eame et je vous demande de renoncer au d\u00e9lai jusqu'\u00e0 ce que vous m'informiez par \u00e9crit de votre d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 ma demande de dispense pour des raisons d'ordre humanitaire.\nEntre-temps, je suis incapable de me pr\u00e9senter au travail en raison de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et, suivant votre r\u00e9ponse, je pourrai pr\u00e9senter un rapport m\u00e9dical faisant \u00e9tat de ma blessure.\n[78] La plaignante n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre.\n[79] Le 4 juillet 2005, Mme Gallegos a avis\u00e9 la plaignante qu'elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9 et qu'elle \u00e9tait cong\u00e9di\u00e9e parce qu'elle ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Le Syndicat de la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en son nom, contestant la d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier. Le grief ne s'est jamais rendu \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape de l'audience.\n[80] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le gestionnaire de la division est le d\u00e9cideur principal en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande d'un employ\u00e9 d'\u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Il tient compte de la situation de l'employ\u00e9 et d\u00e9cide ce qui doit \u00eatre fait. Il a le pouvoir d'accorder un cong\u00e9 ou une prorogation du d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que dans le cas d'une grave p\u00e9nurie, comme celle qui existait \u00e0 Vancouver en 2005, le gestionnaire doit discuter de la situation avec son directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. En 2005, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de M. Pizziol, qui \u00e9tait coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper, \u00e9tait Denis Broshko.\n[81] M. Broshko n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, et son absence n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 justifi\u00e9e. La Compagnie n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve montrant que M. Pizziol avait discut\u00e9 de la situation de la plaignante avec M. Broshko.\n[82] Mme Storms a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas habituel que le CGE accorde des prorogations du d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie, mais elle ajout\u00e9 qu'il y avait eu [TRADUCTION] quelques exceptions pour lesquelles, avec l'accord de la division, elle avait prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu. Par exemple, dans le cas de l'employ\u00e9 dont le p\u00e8re \u00e9tait en phase terminale, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 avec l'employ\u00e9 et qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui accorder une prorogation de d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire de quinze (15) jours. Apr\u00e8s l'expiration de la prorogation de quinze (15) jours, l'employ\u00e9 est rest\u00e9 en mise \u00e0 pied et, plus tard, il a obtenu un autre cong\u00e9 de quelques mois, accord\u00e9 par sa division.\n[83] Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9, dans sa lettre du 27 juin 2005, la plaignante a avis\u00e9 son employeur qu'en avril 2005, elle avait subi une blessure alors qu'elle faisait de l'\u00e9quitation et que, tant qu'elle \u00e9tait en cours de r\u00e9tablissement, elle ne pouvait pas se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u cette information, la Compagnie a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir plus de d\u00e9tails au sujet de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Elle a aussi demand\u00e9 l'avis de son service m\u00e9dical au sujet de l'importance et des r\u00e9percussions de ses blessures. Le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2006, la Compagnie a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 la plaignante pour l'aviser qu'elle avait : [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'examiner votre dossier avec le Syndicat, y compris la possibilit\u00e9 de vous r\u00e9tablir dans votre poste, si votre preuve m\u00e9dicale confirme votre incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie en f\u00e9vrier 2005. Vous devez comprendre que toute possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9tablissement comprendra, \u00e9videmment, le fait que vous devez r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toute p\u00e9nurie dans la Compagnie, conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de votre convention collective. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre, parce qu'au moment o\u00f9 elle l'a re\u00e7ue, elle s'\u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement remise de son accident et qu'aucun probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 ne l'emp\u00eachait de travailler.\nB. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [84] La question soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce est la suivante : la Compagnie a-t-elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers la plaignante en cours d'emploi, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de sa situation de famille?\nC. LE DROIT ET LA TH\u00c8SE EN L'ESP\u00c8CE (i) Les dispositions pertinentes de la LCDP [85] L'article 3 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que la situation de famille est un motif de distinction illicite.\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[86] L'article 7 pr\u00e9voit :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, , par des moyens directs ou indirects;\n(a) de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu;\n(b) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\nto refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[87] L'article 10 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit :\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, l'association patronale or l'organisation syndicale;\nde fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite; de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\nto establish or pursue a policy or practice, or to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[88] Lors de l'examen des articles 7 et 10, il est important que le Tribunal souligne l'objet de la LCDP tel qu'il est \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'article 2 :\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de completer la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[89] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d'autres cours ont toujours soutenu qu'il fallait interpr\u00e9ter les droits de la personne d'une fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. Dans l'arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 :\n24 La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu'en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu'elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu'offre la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu'elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s'interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\n(ii) Le droit a) La preuve prima facie [90] Le fardeau initial revient \u00e0 la plaignante, qui doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille. Une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. (Voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons - Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558.)\n[91] Lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il a droit \u00e0 un redressement en l'absence d'une justification de la partie intim\u00e9e. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208.) Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la plaignante doit, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tablir qu'elle a subi une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP.\nb) Quelle approche doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille? [92] L'\u00e9valuation de l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille doit suivre les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l'arr\u00eat Public Service Labour Relations Commission c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), tout comme tout autre motif de distinction illicite. Cependant, dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, l'interpr\u00e9tation de la notion de situation de famille a entra\u00een\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation de deux \u00e9coles de pens\u00e9es distinctes. Dans certains cas, on a adopt\u00e9 une approche large pour la port\u00e9e de la situation de famille, alors que d'autres ont suivi une approche plus restreinte. Afin de mieux comprendre ce qui est inclus dans la notion de situation de famille, j'examinerai un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions.\n[93] Dans la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), [1988] D.C.D.P. no 4, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si des relations form\u00e9es par une union de fait, par opposition \u00e0 celles form\u00e9es par un mariage l\u00e9gal, relevaient des groupes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de l' \u00e9tat matrimonial et de la situation de famille. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il devait exister un lien du sang ou un lien l\u00e9gal et il a d\u00e9fini la situation de famille comme comprenant tant les liens du sang entre le parent et l'enfant que la relation qui d\u00e9coule des liens du mariage, de la consanguinit\u00e9 ou de l'adoption l\u00e9gale, y compris, bien entendu, la relation ancestrale, qu'elle soit l\u00e9gitime, ill\u00e9gitime ou par adoption, ainsi que les liens entre les \u00e9poux, les fr\u00e8res et surs, la belle-famille, les oncles ou les tantes et les neveux ou les ni\u00e8ces. Dans la d\u00e9cision Lang c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'Immigration), [1990] D.C.D.P. no 8, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 3 : Dans l'opinion du Tribunal, l'expression situation de famille comprend la relation parent-enfant.\n[94] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brown c. Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Douanes et accise), (1993) T.D. 7\/93, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux pages 14 et 18 :\nDans le cas du motif b) [la situation de famille], la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res.\n[...]\nL'avocate de la plaignante ne pr\u00e9tend pas que l'employeur est responsable des soins et de l'\u00e9ducation des enfants. Elle soutient cependant qu'il faut reconna\u00eetre, dans le contexte de la situation de famille, l'existence d'un \u00e9quilibre entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les obligations d\u00e9coulant de l'article 2 et du paragraphe 7b) de la LCDP.\nUn parent doit donc \u00e9valuer avec soin comment il peut le mieux s'acquitter de ses obligations ainsi que de ses devoirs au sein de la famille. \u00c0 cette fin, il doit demander \u00e0 l'employeur de l'aider pour qu'il r\u00e9ponde le mieux possible \u00e0 ces besoins.\nIl est donc facile de comprendre le dilemme \u00e9vident auquel la famille moderne est confront\u00e9e. En effet, selon la tendance socio-\u00e9conomique actuelle, les deux parents travaillent et sont souvent assujettis \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles et \u00e0 des exigences diff\u00e9rentes. Plus souvent qu'autrement, en raison des demandes qui lui sont impos\u00e9es comme parent, la m\u00e8re doit chercher \u00e0 atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre d\u00e9licat entre les besoins de la famille et les exigences li\u00e9es \u00e0 son travail.\n[95] Le Tribunal a enfin conclu que l'interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique qui doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la LCDP servait d'indication claire que dans le contexte de la situation de famille, le parent a le droit et l'obligation d'\u00e9tablir cet \u00e9quilibre, et l'employeur a l'obligation claire de faciliter et d'accommoder cet \u00e9quilibre en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu' [u]ne interpr\u00e9tation moins s\u00e9rieuse des probl\u00e8mes auxquels la famille moderne fait face dans le milieu de travail enl\u00e8verait tout son sens au concept de la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination.\n[96] Le Tribunal a aussi examin\u00e9 la situation de famille comme motif de distinction illicite dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2006] D.C.D.P. no 33. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition judiciaire de l'expression situation de famille, ainsi que des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal qui pr\u00e9cisaient les exigences pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif. Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\n117 La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie par la jurisprudence comme s'entendant de [...] mesures ou d'attitudes qui ont pour effet de limiter les conditions d'embauche ou les perspectives d'emploi des employ\u00e9s sur la base d'une caract\u00e9ristique li\u00e9e \u00e0 leur [...] famille (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. M. A et al, [2000] O.J. no 4275 (C.A.); confirm\u00e9 par [2002] A.C.S. no 67].\n118 Dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'affaire Ontario, mais clairement conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition qu'on y retrouve, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les exigences en mati\u00e8re de preuve qui permettent d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie :\n[...] la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res (Brown c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national, Douanes et Accise), [1993] D.C.D.P. no 7, \u00e0 la page 13). (Voir \u00e9galement Woiden et al c. Dan Lynn, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 18, T.D. 09\/02.)\n[97] Cependant, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une version diff\u00e9rente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, dans l'arr\u00eat Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia c. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. no 922, aux paragraphes 38 et 39 (Campbell River), une d\u00e9cision sur laquelle la Compagnie s'est fortement appuy\u00e9e dans ses conclusions finales. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les param\u00e8tres de la situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de distinction illicite dans le Human Rights Code de la Colombie-Britannique ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on trop large, sinon cela pourrait causer [TRADUCTION] de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux en milieu de travail. La Cour a expliqu\u00e9 qu'une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie [TRADUCTION] lorsqu'un changement dans une condition d'emploi impos\u00e9e par l'employeur entra\u00eene une atteinte grave envers une obligation ou un devoir parental important, ou une obligation ou un devoir familial, de l'employ\u00e9. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Le juge Low a observ\u00e9 qu'il serait difficile d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie dans les cas de conflit entre les exigences du travail et les obligations familiales.\n[98] Dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, le Tribunal n'a pas suivi l'approche pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sa position au sujet de cette d\u00e9cision comme suit :\n120 Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'analyse de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie Britannique. Les codes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, en raison de leur statut de loi fondamentale, doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale afin qu'ils puissent mieux r\u00e9aliser leurs objectifs (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 547, Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne),[1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, aux pages 1134 \u00e0 1136; Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, aux pages 89 et 90). Il serait, \u00e0 mon avis, inappropri\u00e9 de choisir un motif de distinction illicite et de lui donner une d\u00e9finition plus restrictive.\n121 \u00c0 mon humble avis, les pr\u00e9occupations d\u00e9finies par la Cour d'appel, \u00e0 savoir la perturbation grave et les torts s\u00e9rieux sur le lieu de travail, peuvent \u00eatre des questions appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 examiner suivant l'analyse de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, et en particulier suivant le troisi\u00e8me volet de l'analyse, \u00e0 savoir la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 raisonnable. Dans le contexte de l'\u00e9valuation de l'importance de la contrainte, il se peut qu'une mesure d'accommodement donne lieu \u00e0 des questions comme la perturbation grave sur le lieu de travail et l'effet grave sur le moral des employ\u00e9s, qui sont des facteurs appropri\u00e9s (voir l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521). Il appartient \u00e0 l'employeur d'\u00e9tablir au cas par cas l'existence d'une contrainte excessive. Une simple crainte que la mesure d'accommodement entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive n'est pas un motif appropri\u00e9, \u00e0 mon humble avis, pour \u00e9carter l'analyse. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[99] En plus de la logique convaincante de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt pour ne pas suivre l'approche de Campbell River, le Tribunal conclut que l'approche sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e dans cet arr\u00eat impose un fardeau additionnel au plaignant en sous-entendant que la situation de famille, qui est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, n\u00e9cessite la preuve d'une [TRADUCTION] atteinte grave envers une obligation ou un devoir parental ou familial et que cela ne correspond pas \u00e0 l'objet de la LCDP. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [2002] 3 R.C.S. 403, au paragraphe 56, il n'est pas appropri\u00e9, lors de l'interpr\u00e9tation de lois sur les droits de la personne, d'imposer des fardeaux additionnels.\n[100] L'approche du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. no 43, aux paragraphes 29 et 30. Il s'agissait d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Johnstone \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision de la CCDP de ne pas renvoyer au Tribunal sa plainte dans laquelle elle soutenait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille.\n[101] Dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accept\u00e9 l'approche du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [...] rien ne justifie clairement qu'il faille consid\u00e9rer ce type de discrimination comme secondaire ou moins important. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29.) La Cour a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la suggestion de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River selon laquelle une discrimination prima facie n'existe que lorsque l'employeur change les conditions d'emploi semble inapplicable et, \u00e0 mon humble avis, erron\u00e9e en droit. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29). La Cour a aussi conclu que la CCDP, en adoptant le crit\u00e8re de l'atteinte grave lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal, a aussi omis de se conformer aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents permettant clairement d'\u00e9tablir s'il y a discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30.)\n[102] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Johnstone a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, bien que la Cour d'appel e\u00fbt pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'exprimait pas d'opinion sur la version appropri\u00e9e du crit\u00e8re portant sur l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 son raisonnement sur la conclusion que le d\u00e9faut de la CCDP de cibler clairement le crit\u00e8re qu'elle avait appliqu\u00e9 constituait un fondement suffisant pour conclure que la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. ([2008] A.C.F. no 427, au paragraphe 2).\n[103] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Johnstone (voir Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, 2010 TCDP 20). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal conclut, entre autres :\n[220] Le Tribunal accepte que ce ne sont pas toutes les tensions qui ont lieu dans le contexte de l'\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie-personnelle qui peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es par la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, mais ce n'est pas l'argument qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'argument de Mme Johnstone est qu'une telle protection devrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e lorsque appropri\u00e9e et raisonnable, compte tenu des circonstances pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[221] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, nous traitons ici du cas d'une vraie personne qui a des obligations envers ses jeunes enfants et des r\u00e9percussions importantes sur la capacit\u00e9 de cette personne de remplir cette obligation. Il ne revient pas au Tribunal de traiter de toutes les obligations familiales et de tous les conflits entre le travail d'un employ\u00e9 et ses obligations.\n[...]\n[230] [...] le Tribunal conclut que rien dans l'article 2 ne cr\u00e9e une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive et \u00e9troite de la situation de famille.\n[231] Au contraire, l'objectif sous-jacent de la LCDP, comme je l'ai dit, est de fournir \u00e0 toute personne un m\u00e9canisme garantissant le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins [...]. Il est raisonnable que les protections fournies comprennent celles d\u00e9coulant naturellement de l'une des relations les plus fondamentales de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui existent, celles du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re envers son enfant. Le fait que le libell\u00e9 de l'article 2 mentionne l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement prouve que la LCDP reconna\u00eet que les individus font des choix distincts, y compris celui d'avoir des enfants, et que la LCDP prot\u00e8ge tous les individus contre la discrimination envers ces choix.\n[...]\n[233] Le Tribunal conclut que la libert\u00e9 de choisir de devenir p\u00e8re ou m\u00e8re est si vitale qu'elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre restreinte par la crainte de subir des cons\u00e9quences discriminatoires. En tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le Canada devrait reconna\u00eetre cette libert\u00e9 fondamentale et appuyer ce choix autant que possible. Pour l'employeur, cela signifie \u00e9valuer les situations telles que celles de Mme Johnstone de fa\u00e7on individuelle et travailler avec elle pour cr\u00e9er une solution fonctionnelle qui \u00e9quilibre ses obligations parentales avec ses occasions d'emploi, sauf contrainte excessive.\n[104] R\u00e9cemment, le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique (le TDFP) a examin\u00e9 s'il fallait suivre l'approche pour la situation de famille \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt ou celle \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il appliquerait l'approche de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt. Dans la d\u00e9cision Chantal Rajotte c. Le pr\u00e9sident de l'Agence canadienne des services frontaliers et al, 2009 TDFP 0025, le TDFP a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'approche \u00e0 adopter est celle contenue dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, laquelle a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone (paragraphe 127). Le TDFP a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLa preuve doit donc d\u00e9montrer que la plaignante est un parent, qu'elle doit remplir des t\u00e2ches et des obligations comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que, de surcro\u00eet, elle est un parent devant remplir ces t\u00e2ches et ces obligations. La plaignante doit prouver qu'en cons\u00e9quence de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations et de la conduite de l'intim\u00e9, elle n'a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res. (Paragraphe 127)\n[105] Un examen de certaines d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie Britannique (le BCHRT) d\u00e9montre que les d\u00e9cisions de ce Tribunal ne suivent pas uniform\u00e9ment l'approche de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Par exemple, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que cette approche n'\u00e9tait pas applicable dans le cas de la fourniture de services (Stephenson c. Sooke Lake Modular Home Co-operative Association, 2007 BCHRT 341). Cette approche a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e dans deux d\u00e9cisions du BCHRT qui portaient sur une situation d'emploi (Haggerty c. Kamloops Society for Community Living, [2008] BCHRT 172, au paragraphe 17 et Mahdi c. Hertz Canada Limited, [2008] BCHRT 245, aux paragraphes 60 et 61).\n[106] Dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau c. Ferguson Moving (1990) Ltd., dba Ferguson Moving and Storage et al., 2009 BCHRT 272, le BCHRT a mentionn\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions Campbell River, Hoyt et Johnstone, ainsi qu'une autre de ses d\u00e9cisions dans l'affaire Miller c. BCTF (no 2), 2009 BCHRT 34. Le BCHRT a soulign\u00e9 que, dans la d\u00e9cision Miller, il avait conclu que le crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River ne s'appliquait que dans le contexte dans lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9. Le BCHRT a cit\u00e9 l'extrait suivant de la d\u00e9cision Miller : [TRADUCTION] La formulation [dans Campbell River] de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille dans le contexte d'un conflit entre les obligations d'emploi et les obligations familiales ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e m\u00e9caniquement dans tous les cas de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (Falardeau, au paragraphe 29).\n[107] La question en litige dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau \u00e9tait celle de savoir si un employ\u00e9, qui avait refus\u00e9 d'effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales qu'il avait envers son fils, avait subi de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le Tribunal a conclu que le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 31 et 32 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, Ferguson souhaitait maintenir un mod\u00e8le bien \u00e9tabli d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de ses clients. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 M. Falardeau a avis\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s de ses besoins et de ses ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde, les intim\u00e9s croyaient, avec raison selon la preuve dont je suis saisi, que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait ais\u00e9ment capable d'organiser des services de garde pour son fils si ses heures de travail se prolongeaient. En effet, il l'avait fait de nombreuses fois. Le fait que ni le mod\u00e8le de travail de M. Falardeau ni ses demandes ou ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde n'avaient chang\u00e9 laissent entendre qu'il avait peut-\u00eatre soulev\u00e9 la question des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison du fait qu'il n'aimait pas travailler sur les sites de construction, plut\u00f4t qu'en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s familiales.\nRien ne donne \u00e0 penser que son fils avait des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux, ou que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait exceptionnellement qualifi\u00e9 pour prendre soin de son fils. Bien que ces facteurs ne soient pas essentiels pour \u00e9tablir une obligation parentale importante, la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce n'a \u00e9tabli aucun autre facteur qui exempterait M. Falardeau des obligations ordinaires d'un parent qui doit jongler entre les demandes de son emploi et le besoin de fournir des soins appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 ses enfants. Compte tenu de ces faits, je ne peux pas conclure qu'il y a eu atteinte grave aux obligations ou aux devoirs importants parentaux ou familiaux. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[108] Dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau, le BCHRT a essentiellement suivi le raisonnement formul\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Cependant, m\u00eame s'il avait suivi l'approche dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, sa conclusion aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame. La principale diff\u00e9rence entre la situation dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau et celle en l'esp\u00e8ce est que, dans l'affaire Falardeau, il n'y avait eu aucun changement dans l'horaire de travail de M. Falardeau ou dans ses besoins ou ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde. De plus, son employeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de ses besoins et de ses ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde et il croyait, avec raison, que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 obtenir des services de garde pour son fils si ses heures de travail \u00e9taient prolong\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Falardeau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, parce qu'il n'avait pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de participer \u00e9galement et enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 son emploi en raison de ses obligations et de ses devoirs en tant que p\u00e8re.\n[109] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante, en \u00e9tant forc\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, faisait face \u00e0 une atteinte grave \u00e0 ses devoirs et obligations de m\u00e8re. L'affaire aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si la plaignante avait refus\u00e9 d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 son terminal local.\n[110] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la Compagnie a soutenu que la position de la plaignante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une pr\u00e9misse erron\u00e9e. Il a qualifi\u00e9 la plainte de demande visant \u00e0 ce que l'employeur prenne des mesures d'accommodement pour les [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales et les choix de vie de la plaignante. Il a ajout\u00e9 que cette position \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une interpr\u00e9tation extr\u00eamement large de la LCDP et que la seule caract\u00e9ristique soulev\u00e9e par la plaignante qui pouvait d\u00e9clencher la protection pr\u00e9vue par la loi \u00e9tait le fait qu'elle est une m\u00e8re et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle doit prendre soin de ses enfants. L'avocat a ajout\u00e9 que le fait d'exiger qu'un employ\u00e9 qui a des enfants respecte sa responsabilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail comme l'exige la convention collective ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En fait, il a soutenu que le refus d'un employ\u00e9 de respecter ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet constitue un choix qui est de nature exclusivement personnelle et pour lequel, en l'absence de circonstances exceptionnelles, un employeur n'a aucune obligation d'accommodement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a conclu que le fait d'accueillir la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 ajouter les [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales \u00e0 la liste des motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP, sous le couvert de l'expansion de la notion de situation de famille.\n[111] \u00c0 l'appui de ces arguments, l'avocat a mentionn\u00e9 de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions, y compris la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River, qui, \u00e0 son avis, pr\u00e9sentait une approche plus structur\u00e9e et pragmatique que celle de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt du Tribunal. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision arbitrale Canadian Staff Union c. Canadian Union of Public Employees, (2006) 88 C.L.A.S. 212. Dans cette affaire, le plaignant avait refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Halifax apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 que le lieu d'emploi serait Halifax. Le plaignant habitait \u00e0 St. John's (Terre-Neuve), o\u00f9 il avait la garde partag\u00e9e de ses enfants avec son ancienne \u00e9pouse. Il \u00e9tait aussi responsable de prendre soin de sa m\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e. Le Syndicat a soutenu que la notion de situation de famille ne se limitait pas au statut de p\u00e8re ou de m\u00e8re comme tel, mais s'\u00e9tendait aussi \u00e0 l'accommodement des responsabilit\u00e9s familiales du plaignant.\n[112] Selon la d\u00e9cision arbitrale, le grief soulevait des questions importantes de droits de la personne qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9es comme suit : [TRADUCTION] la d\u00e9signation par un employeur d'un lieu g\u00e9ographique pr\u00e9cis dans un affichage d'emploi, et l'insistance par celui-ci qu'un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite obtenir ce poste habite \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 il peut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 ce lieu, constitue-t-elle une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille, si les responsabilit\u00e9s matrimoniales et familiales de l'employ\u00e9 l'emp\u00eachent r\u00e9ellement d'habiter l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il peut se pr\u00e9senter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au travail au lieu pr\u00e9cis\u00e9? (au paragraphe 6).\n[113] L'arbitre a rejet\u00e9 le grief au motif que [TRADUCTION] au sens de toute loi pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce et de la convention collective, c'\u00e9tait le choix du plaignant, et non ses responsabilit\u00e9s matrimoniales et familiales, qui l'emp\u00eachait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Halifax (au paragraphe 9). L'arbitre a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] ce que l'employeur a fait ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial ou sur la situation de famille et l'employeur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu par la loi de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour le plaignant jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive.\n[114] Dans son analyse des d\u00e9cisions pertinentes, l'arbitre a adopt\u00e9 l'approche restreinte de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la situation de famille. Bien que la d\u00e9cision soit int\u00e9ressante, le Tribunal note que les faits li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision arbitrale sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans la d\u00e9cision arbitrale, le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste, sachant pertinemment que la description de poste pr\u00e9cisait que l'emploi \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Halifax. Le plaignant avait le choix de refuser d'aller \u00e0 Halifax et de rester dans son poste \u00e0 St. John's, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce, dont le choix \u00e9tait de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Les faits donnent aussi \u00e0 penser qu'il n'y avait pas d'augmentation de salaire ou d'avantages importants pour le poste \u00e0 Halifax par rapport \u00e0 celui de St. John's et que le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature parce qu'il souhaitait vivre un changement et de nouveaux d\u00e9fis (paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal note aussi que l'un des enfants du plaignant avait 19 ans et commen\u00e7ait l'universit\u00e9 et que l'autre avait 15 ans et commen\u00e7ait l'\u00e9cole secondaire et que, comme l'arbitre l'a mentionn\u00e9, bien que les fils du plaignant tiraient sans aucun doute des avantages importants de sa pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 St. John's, ils n'avaient besoin d'aucun soin sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 de sa part et il pouvait s'organiser pour assurer leur bien-\u00eatre en son absence (au paragraphe 141).\n[115] L'avocat de la Compagnie a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario Wight c. Ontario (no 2), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/191, qui portait sur une employ\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, avait refus\u00e9 de retourner au travail en soutenant qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable d'obtenir des services de garde appropri\u00e9s. Elle a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e au motif qu'elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a conclu que la plaignante avait [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9goriquement refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre les attentes raisonnables de son employeur qu'elle prenne les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour retourner au travail \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Le Tribunal a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle allait \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 jusqu'en octobre au plus t\u00f4t ou en janvier au plus tard (au paragraphe 321). Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un cas d'une personne qui, malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, ne pouvait pas trouver de services de garde pour son enfant et devait choisir entre son enfant et son emploi. Une fois de plus, il s'agit d'une situation dont les faits diff\u00e8rent beaucoup de la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[116] L'avocat a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Smith c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2008 TCDP 15, une d\u00e9cision rendue en mai 2008 par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Le Tribunal ne voit pas en quoi cette d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre comparable \u00e0 la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans l'affaire Smith, bien que le plaignant e\u00fbt soutenu, entre autres, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, le Tribunal a conclu que ce motif de discrimination n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans la plainte et qu'aucune jurisprudence n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour d\u00e9montrer que les faits constituaient une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (au paragraphe 289).\n[117] L'avocat de la Compagnie a finalement mentionn\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer canadiens (le Bureau). Bien qu'elles soient int\u00e9ressantes, toutes les d\u00e9cisions du Bureau sont fond\u00e9es sur des faits particuliers et elles ne nous aident pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[118] Le Tribunal ne souscrit pas non plus \u00e0 l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel un concept ouvert de la situation de famille donnerait lieu \u00e0 une avalanche de demandes et que cela risquerait de causer de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux au travail. Comme la Human Rights and Citizenship Commission de l'Alberta l'a not\u00e9 au paragraphe 242 de sa d\u00e9cision Rawleigh c. Canada Safeway Ltd, rendue le 29 septembre 2009, [TRADUCTION] chaque affaire doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres. Le fait d'appuyer la croyance qu'une avalanche pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e par des personnes opportunistes est tr\u00e8s dangereux et possiblement discriminatoire.\n[119] Le Tribunal souhaite aussi rappeler que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d'autres cours ont toujours soutenu que les droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. Dans l'arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 :\n24 La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu'en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu'elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu'offre la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu'elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s'interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\n[120] Selon l'analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal conclut qu'il existe deux interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes dans la jurisprudence au sujet de l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille : l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River et l'interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt. Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'approche de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River a pour effet d'imposer une hi\u00e9rarchie des motifs de discrimination, certains motifs, comme la situation de famille, \u00e9tant consid\u00e9r\u00e9s moins importants que les autres. Cette approche ne suit pas l'objet de la LCDP. De plus, toutes les permutations de l'approche appliqu\u00e9e au motif de la situation de famille en Colombie-Britannique qui ont suivi l'arr\u00eat Campbell River appuient la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle la situation de famille ne devrait pas \u00eatre isol\u00e9e sous une norme diff\u00e9rente et plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re ou plus lourde d'\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie. La seule solution est d'appliquer le m\u00eame crit\u00e8re que celui appliqu\u00e9 pour les autres motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP. Cette approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt et a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone.\n[121] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suivrai l'approche \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, qui respecte le principe des droits de la personne selon lequel tous les motifs de discrimination doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale.\n[122] De plus, tenant compte de la nature et du statut sp\u00e9ciaux des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en tant que lois quasi-constitutionnelles, le Tribunal conclut que l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de la situation de famille telles qu'elles sont propos\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt sont celles qu'il convient d'adopter. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, selon laquelle les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent une interpr\u00e9tation large, alors que les exceptions et les d\u00e9fenses sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on plus restreinte.\nc) Une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie? [123] En 2005, la plaignante \u00e9tait m\u00e8re de deux jeunes enfants. La preuve \u00e9tablit aussi qu'elle avait avis\u00e9 la Compagnie qu'un d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement temporaire \u00e0 Vancouver, sans renseignement au sujet de la dur\u00e9e de son s\u00e9jour l\u00e0-bas ou de l'h\u00e9bergement pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e, troublerait la garde de ses enfants et qu'il lui serait impossible de prendre des mesures afin d'obtenir des services de garde appropri\u00e9s pour ses enfants. De plus, son mari \u00e9tait aussi un cheminot dont les absences \u00e9taient fr\u00e9quentes et dont les horaires \u00e9taient impr\u00e9visibles. Elle avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que tant qu'elle pouvait travailler \u00e0 son terminal local, \u00e0 Jasper, elle pouvait trouver des services de garde, quoiqu'avec difficult\u00e9.\n[124] Dans ses diverses lettres \u00e0 la Compagnie, la plaignante a expliqu\u00e9 sa situation de famille, mais elle n'a jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales telles que la garde d'enfants n'\u00e9taient pas des [TRADUCTION] raisons satisfaisantes pour qu'un employ\u00e9 soit exempt\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. La Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que la situation de la plaignante ne n\u00e9cessitait pas d'accommodement en raison de sa situation de famille au sens de la LCDP. Elle \u00e9tait aussi d'avis que la situation de la plaignante \u00e9tait un choix personnel de ne pas respecter ses obligations professionnelles afin de donner priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres aspects de sa vie, une situation que la Compagnie a qualifi\u00e9 d'\u00e9quilibre [TRADUCTION] travail-famille.\n[125] Le Tribunal conclut que le droit n'appuie simplement pas le point de vue de la Compagnie selon lequel la situation de famille ne comprend pas la situation de la plaignante. La situation de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de m\u00e8re de deux enfants ainsi que les ramifications, qu'elle a expliqu\u00e9es dans ses diverses lettres, du fait de lui ordonner de se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver la placent dans la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 la Compagnie et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande aux responsables appropri\u00e9s de la Compagnie. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont reconnu qu'une telle demande aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 qui en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait Colin Pizziol, le coordonnateur de trains \u00e0 Jasper. Les lettres de la plaignante lui \u00e9taient adress\u00e9es. Malheureusement, M. Pizziol n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, et les autres t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ne pouvaient pas expliquer de quelle fa\u00e7on il avait g\u00e9r\u00e9 la situation. La preuve incontest\u00e9e de la plaignante \u00e9tait que ni son superviseur, ni un autre gestionnaire de la Compagnie n'avaient r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses lettres ni discut\u00e9 de la situation avec elle.\n[126] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la plaignante est une m\u00e8re et que ce statut comprend les devoirs et les obligations qui reviennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aux parents. En raison de ces devoirs et obligations, la plaignante, selon les r\u00e8gles et les pratiques de la Compagnie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de participer de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale et compl\u00e8te \u00e0 son emploi au sein de la Compagnie. Cela \u00e9tant, le fardeau repose maintenant sur la Compagnie de d\u00e9montrer que la norme ou l'action discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en raison d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nd) La Compagnie a-t-elle pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante? [127] Le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu'il y a eu accommodement jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive revient \u00e0 l'employeur.\n[128] En raison de sa situation de famille, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement. La Compagnie n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 cette demande, sauf pour le fait qu'elle a accept\u00e9 de proroger pendant environ quatre mois le d\u00e9lai que la plaignante avait pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Selon les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie, cette [TRADUCTION] mesure d'accommodement lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e afin qu'elle prenne les [TRADUCTION] mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9gler la question de la garde des enfants. Il est surprenant de voir l'utilisation de l'expression mesure d'accommodement, puisque aucun des t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie n'\u00e9tait d'avis qu'il existait une obligation de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante ou que la LCDP s'appliquait \u00e0 sa situation. La Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que la plaignante devait faire un choix entre son emploi et sa situation de famille, voil\u00e0 tout. M. Kerry Morris, le gestionnaire des relations de travail de la Compagnie, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne voyait [TRADUCTION] pas la situation de famille comme une question d'accommodement. \u00c0 son avis, bien qu'il ne lui ait jamais parl\u00e9, la plaignante demandait une prorogation du d\u00e9lai pr\u00e9vu pour qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver, afin de prendre des mesures quant \u00e0 la garde de ses enfants. Il croyait que la Compagnie lui avait donn\u00e9 suffisamment de temps pour prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires.\n[129] Quant \u00e0 lui, M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] la demande qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e [il n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 qui la lui a envoy\u00e9e] \u00e9tait qu'elles [la plaignante, KW et CR] avaient besoin de plus de temps pour r\u00e9gler leurs situations. Il s'agissait de question de garde d'enfants et elles avaient besoin de plus de temps. J'ai accueilli la demande. \u00c0 mon avis, je prenais des mesures d'accommodement pour elles parce que je leur accordais plus de temps. Je ne pensais pas que ce que je faisais \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. Elles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 en mise \u00e0 pied depuis longtemps, pas comme un employ\u00e9 qui est affect\u00e9, est mis \u00e0 pied, puis est affect\u00e9, et est mis \u00e0 pied qui s'attendrait \u00e0 \u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail. Elles \u00e9taient en mise \u00e0 pied depuis un long moment. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles ne s'attendaient probablement pas \u00e0 un rappel \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et, \u00e0 mon avis, il semblait raisonnable de leur accorder plus de temps. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il savait qu'il s'agissait d'[TRADUCTION] obligations parentales de quelque sorte et qu'il avait compris que la plaignante [TRADUCTION] avait besoin de temps pour s'organiser, mais il a ajout\u00e9 que cela ne lui avait pas donn\u00e9 l'impression qu'il s'agissait d'une question vis\u00e9e par la LCDP.\n[130] Tant le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante que celui des t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie \u00e9tablit, sans l'ombre d'un doute, que la Compagnie n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 sa politique d'accommodement dans le cas de la plaignante. La preuve montre aussi que d'autres employ\u00e9s qui avaient besoin de mesures d'accommodement pour des raisons qui pouvaient aussi relever de la LCDP et de la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie, et qui ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, ou ne s'y sont pas imm\u00e9diatement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. Par exemple, les employ\u00e9s U et E, dont les parents \u00e9taient malades, ont tous les deux obtenus des cong\u00e9s de compassion et n'ont pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. De plus, d'autres employ\u00e9s dont la situation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience ont soit obtenu des cong\u00e9s, soit \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s par leurs superviseurs et n'ont pas eu \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n[131] La Compagnie a essentiellement expliqu\u00e9 que la demande d'accommodement de la plaignante fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e en raison de la nature des activit\u00e9s de la Compagnie, qui exigeait que tous les employ\u00e9s disponibles se pr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 Vancouver afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie en 2005. Cependant, lorsque l'avocat de la Compagnie a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Storms si la p\u00e9nurie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e si la plaignante s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver en 2005, elle a r\u00e9pondu sans h\u00e9siter [TRADUCTION] non, mais elle a imm\u00e9diatement ajout\u00e9 que cela aurait tout de m\u00eame lib\u00e9r\u00e9 un des gestionnaires qui travaillait au triage en raison de la p\u00e9nurie.\n[132] Le crit\u00e8re applicable pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite dans le contexte de l'emploi et si un employeur a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour un employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive est celui \u00e9tabli par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a normalis\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re applicable quant \u00e0 la discrimination et a rejet\u00e9 l'ancienne distinction entre la discrimination directe et indirecte.\n[133] Lorsqu'un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le fardeau est alors transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'employeur, qui doit d\u00e9montrer que l'acte ou la norme discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ). \u00c0 ce sujet, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 54 et 55 de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin :\nL'employeur peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s\nqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\nCette m\u00e9thode est fond\u00e9e sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir des normes qui composent avec l'apport potentiel de tous les employ\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela peut \u00eatre fait sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive. Il est \u00e9vident que des normes peuvent l\u00e9ser les membres d'un groupe particulier. Mais, comme le juge Wilson l'a fait remarquer dans Central Alberta Dairy Pool, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 518, [s]'il est possible de trouver une solution raisonnable qui \u00e9vite d'imposer une r\u00e8gle donn\u00e9e aux membres d'un groupe, cette r\u00e8gle ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme [une EPJ]. Il s'ensuit que la r\u00e8gle ou la norme jug\u00e9e raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire doit composer avec les diff\u00e9rences individuelles dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne cause aucune contrainte excessive. \u00c0 moins qu'aucun accommodement ne soit possible sans imposer une contrainte excessive, la norme telle qu'elle existe n'est pas une EPJ, et la preuve prima facie de l'existence de discrimination n'est pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9.\n[134] \u00c0 l'audience, la Compagnie ne s'est pas attard\u00e9e aux deux premiers crit\u00e8res de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, sauf pour d\u00e9clarer dans ses conclusions finales que la preuve avait clairement montr\u00e9 que la norme vis\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 aux int\u00e9r\u00eats commerciaux de la Compagnie et que la Compagnie et le Syndicat l'avait adopt\u00e9e de bonne foi, croyant qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire aux op\u00e9rations du r\u00e9seau ferroviaire de la Compagnie. La Compagnie n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la preuve sur laquelle elle se fondait pour cette affirmation, et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au Syndicat n'est pas appuy\u00e9e par la preuve, puisqu'aucun repr\u00e9sentant du Syndicat n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et que je n'ai aucun souvenir d'un t\u00e9moignage quelconque \u00e0 ce sujet. Quoi qu'il en soit, j'effectuerai l'analyse des deux premiers crit\u00e8res afin de d\u00e9terminer si la Compagnie a \u00e9tabli qu'il existait une EPJ.\n[135] La premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape vise \u00e0 cibler l'objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme contest\u00e9e et de d\u00e9terminer s'il est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail. Il faut d\u00e9terminer ce que la norme contest\u00e9e vise g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser. L'objet de la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape n'est pas de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de la norme en question, mais plut\u00f4t de d\u00e9terminer la validit\u00e9 de son objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. En l'esp\u00e8ce, la norme en question est celle qui permet \u00e0 la Compagnie de [TRADUCTION] forcer les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 148.11 de la convention collective, les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 29 juin 1990 peuvent \u00eatre forc\u00e9s de travailler dans un autre terminal dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest et ont l'obligation de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce terminal au plus tard dans les trente (30) jours suivant l'appel, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne pr\u00e9sentent une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier le fait qu'ils ne se pr\u00e9senteront pas. Ces employ\u00e9s sont commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s de la [traduction] cat\u00e9gorie D. Ils sont aussi appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, parce qu'ils ont l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel au travail \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de leur terminal. S'ils n'y r\u00e9pondent pas, la Compagnie peut mettre fin \u00e0 leur emploi.\n[136] L'autre cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s comprend les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant le 29 juin 1990. Ces employ\u00e9s sont appel\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Dans ce groupe d'employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, on retrouve ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant 1982 et qui portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie A et de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie B, respectivement. Ces employ\u00e9s ne peuvent pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail ailleurs qu'\u00e0 leur terminal local. Les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 1982, mais avant le 29 juin 1990, portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie C et peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail \u00e0 des terminaux adjacents.\n[137] En l'esp\u00e8ce, les employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied de la cat\u00e9gorie D, dont faisait partie la plaignante, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9s de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, en raison de son emplacement, le terminal de Vancouver est tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9. Il s'agit d'un point central pour le march\u00e9 canadien de la Compagnie. Une p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 Vancouver a d'importantes r\u00e9percussions, car elle peut compromettre la capacit\u00e9 de la Compagnie \u00e0 fonctionner ad\u00e9quatement partout dans son r\u00e9seau. Ni la plaignante, ni la CCDP n'ont contest\u00e9 le fait que la Compagnie avait une raison l\u00e9gitime de vouloir r\u00e9gler la p\u00e9nurie de chefs de train \u00e0 Vancouver en 2005. Le fait de forcer des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail, surtout lorsque la p\u00e9nurie peut avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur les activit\u00e9s de l'employeur. Le Tribunal conclut donc que la Compagnie a satisfait au premier volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[138] Une fois que la Compagnie \u00e9tablit la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de son objectif g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, elle doit d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a adopt\u00e9 la norme en question en croyant sinc\u00e8rement que celle-ci \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail, et sans qu'elle ait eu l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers la plaignante. Si l'imposition de la norme n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire ou si elle \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9e par une intention discriminatoire, elle ne peut alors pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. (Voir Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 60.) Aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience au sujet du fait que la norme de la Compagnie de forcer des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries, telle qu'elle est \u00e9crite \u00e0 la clause 148.11 de la convention collective, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e avec l'intention de faire preuve de discrimination envers la plaignante. Il est vrai que l'avocat de la plaignante a soulev\u00e9 dans ses conclusions finales un point au sujet du fait que la clause 148.11 est discriminatoire. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il a fait allusion au traitement diff\u00e9rentiel entre les chefs de train qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant juin 1990 et ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s. Il a not\u00e9 que, lorsque la plaignante a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la Compagnie, cette distinction n'existait pas. La preuve montre que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e en 1991, mais la distinction est entr\u00e9e en vigueur en f\u00e9vrier 1992 et s'appliquait aux employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s juin 1990. L'avocat a aussi soutenu que, comme la [TRADUCTION] grande majorit\u00e9 des femmes chefs de train avait \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e apr\u00e8s juin 1990, la distinction constituait une pratique discriminatoire contre les femmes chefs de train. Bien que, du point de vue de l'argumentation, ce point soit int\u00e9ressant, le Tribunal ne rel\u00e8ve aucune preuve convaincante \u00e0 l'appui de ces conclusions. Le Tribunal conclut donc que la Compagnie a satisfait au deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[139] La troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re t\u00e2che de la Compagnie est de d\u00e9montrer que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire afin que l'employeur puisse accomplir son objectif. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, la Compagnie doit \u00e9tablir qu'elle ne peut pas prendre de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et les autres personnes n\u00e9gativement touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir de contrainte excessive. En d'autres mots, comme la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement touch\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille par la norme for\u00e7ant les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 couvrir des p\u00e9nuries, la Compagnie aurait-elle pu l'accommoder sans subir de contrainte excessive? La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est affirmative, pour les motifs suivants.\n[140] L'utilisation de l'expression excessive laisse entendre qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Ce n'est que la contrainte excessive qui satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. (Voir Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, \u00e0 la page 984.) Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est-il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive. (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62.) De plus, lorsqu'un employeur \u00e9value s'il est en mesure d'accommoder un employ\u00e9, il doit effectuer une analyse individuelle de la situation de l'employ\u00e9. \u00c0 ce sujet, dans l'arr\u00eat Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 161, au paragraphe 22, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : Le caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 du processus d'accommodement ne saurait \u00eatre minimis\u00e9.\n[141] Dans l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521, la juge Wilson a examin\u00e9 les facteurs dont il faut tenir compte lors de l'\u00e9valuation de l'obligation d'un employeur d'accommoder un employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive. Parmi les facteurs pertinents se trouvent le co\u00fbt financier des m\u00e9thodes possibles d'accommodement, l'interchangeabilit\u00e9 relative de l'effectif et des installations et la possibilit\u00e9 d'interf\u00e9rence importante avec les droits d'autres employ\u00e9s. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la norme ou la pratique qui exclut des membres d'un groupe particulier en fonction d'hypoth\u00e8ses relevant de l'impression est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suspecte. (Colombie- Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie-Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer), paragraphe 31.) Les employeurs doivent aussi faire preuve d'innovation, tout en restant pratiques, lorsqu'ils examinent les options d'accommodement dans une situation particuli\u00e8re.\n[142] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la Compagnie a laiss\u00e9 entendre que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada avait reformul\u00e9 les principes qui s'appliquent \u00e0 la notion de contrainte excessive dans l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), 2008 CSC. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cette interpr\u00e9tation de l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec. Au contraire, le Tribunal conclut que cet arr\u00eat correspond aux d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de la Cour supr\u00eame au sujet de la question de la contrainte excessive. Dans l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que l'employeur n'ait pas l'obligation de changer les conditions de travail de fa\u00e7on fondamentale, il a l'obligation, s'il peut le faire sans contrainte excessive, de modifier le lieu de travail ou les t\u00e2ches d'un employ\u00e9 afin de lui permettre d'effectuer son travail (au paragraphe 16). La Cour supr\u00eame a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu' [e]n raison du caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 de l'obligation d'accommodement et de la diversit\u00e9 des circonstances qui peuvent survenir, toute r\u00e8gle rigide est \u00e0 \u00e9viter. Si une entreprise peut, sans en subir de contrainte excessive, offrir des horaires de travail variables ou assouplir la t\u00e2che de l'employ\u00e9, ou m\u00eame \u00e0 autoriser des d\u00e9placements de personnel, permettant \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de fournir sa prestation de travail, l'employeur devra alors ainsi accommoder l'employ\u00e9 (paragraphe 17). (Voir aussi Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 218.)\n[143] La Compagnie soutient que, si l'accommodement \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP, elle avait fourni un [TRADUCTION] accommodement raisonnable \u00e0 la plaignante pendant plus de quatre (4) mois pour qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver, plut\u00f4t que le minimum de quinze (15) jours \u00e9tabli dans la convention collective. La Compagnie soutient aussi que le fait d'accorder l'indemnit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par la plaignante constituerait une contrainte excessive parce que cela reviendrait \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui sont parents l'\u00e9quivalent d'une [TRADUCTION] super anciennet\u00e9 dans la convention collective, simplement en raison de leur statut de parents.\n[144] Je traiterai d'abord de l'argument au sujet de l' accommodement raisonnable.\n[145] La Compagnie soutient que le fait d'accorder du temps de plus \u00e0 la plaignante pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9tait la seule mesure d'accommodement qu'elle avait l'obligation de prendre. Cependant, la preuve montre clairement que cela n'\u00e9tait pas du tout une r\u00e9ponse valable \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante ni au fondement factuel de sa situation, qu'elle avait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 son employeur dans ses diverses lettres.\n[146] La preuve incontest\u00e9e de la plaignante \u00e9tablit qu'elle a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Pizziol, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper, et \u00e0 d'autres gestionnaires de la Compagnie, de nombreuses fois pour expliquer sa situation de famille. Elle les a avis\u00e9s qu'il lui serait difficile d'amener ses enfants \u00e0 Vancouver et qu'en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s envers ses enfants, il n'\u00e9tait pas non plus possible de les laisser avec leur p\u00e8re, dont les obligations de travail lui causaient les m\u00eames probl\u00e8mes de garde. Elle a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que sa situation soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une question de compassion, en application de la convention collective, et qu'on lui permette d'attendre que la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e ou qu'il y ait du travail pour elle au terminal de Jasper ou au terminal adjacent d'Edson.\n[147] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 ces lettres comme signifiant que la plaignante demandait des mesures d'accommodement en raison de sa situation de famille. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le gestionnaire de la division, M. Pizziol en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tait le d\u00e9cideur principal en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande d'un employ\u00e9 d'\u00eatre exempt\u00e9 de l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, pour prendre cette d\u00e9cision, il aurait tenu compte de la situation de la personne et il aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 ce qu'il devait en faire. M. Pizziol avait le pouvoir d'accorder un cong\u00e9 ou une prorogation du d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 que dans le cas d'une grave p\u00e9nurie, comme celle qui existait \u00e0 Vancouver en 2005, le gestionnaire doit discuter de la situation avec son directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. En 2005, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de M. Pizziol \u00e9tait Denis Broshko.\n[148] Comme ce f\u00fbt le cas pour M. Pizziol, M. Broshko n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et la Compagnie n'a donn\u00e9 aucune explication pour son absence. La Compagnie n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve montrant que M. Pizziol avait discut\u00e9 de la situation de la plaignante avec M. Broshko.\n[149] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire qu'il a eu une discussion avec le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Syndicat au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 de proroger le d\u00e9lai accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Il a ajout\u00e9 que pendant cette discussion, la question d'un accommodement pour la situation de famille n'avait [TRADUCTION] jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e et qu'il n'avait jamais vu les lettres de la plaignante \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[150] La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que la Compagnie n'a pas fait preuve de compassion envers la situation de la plaignante. Elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses nombreuses demandes de mesures d'accommodement et personne n'a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante, ni n'a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle, pour discuter de sa situation, m\u00eame si la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie pr\u00e9voit que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus doit \u00eatre une rencontre avec l'employ\u00e9. La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi clairement que Mme Storms et M. Torchia ne se sentaient pas responsables au sujet de questions relevant de la LCDP. Ils ont tous les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 et les responsables des ressources humaines sont les personnes aupr\u00e8s desquelles la question aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e. Malheureusement, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, ni M. Pizziol ni Mme Mary-Jane Morrison, la personne responsable des ressources humaines \u00e0 Edmonton en 2005, n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[151] Il est clair que les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ne consid\u00e9raient pas la situation de famille - du moins les questions de situation de famille qui comprennent des obligations et des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales - comme un motif de discrimination qui n\u00e9cessitait une forme d'accommodement. Dans leur conception des divers motifs de discrimination \u00e9tablis dans la LCDP, il semble qu'ils ont choisi certains motifs qui, selon eux, donnent droit \u00e0 un accommodement, alors que d'autres n'y ouvrent pas droit. Par exemple, ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Compagnie n'avait pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 accommoder des employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, mais qui ne pouvaient pas y aller en raison d'un parent malade. Ils ont aussi reconnu que la Compagnie, dans le pass\u00e9, avait accommod\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Cependant, sans chercher \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la nature de sa demande, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation de la plaignante ne constituait pas une situation n\u00e9cessitant un accommodement en vertu de la LCDP.\n[152] Mme Ziemer a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait pris des mesures d'accommodement pour un employ\u00e9 qui lui permettaient d'\u00eatre absent du tableau de service chaque deux semaines, parce qu'il n'avait des droits de visite que pendant 48 heures, la fin de semaine, chaque deux semaines. Un autre exemple portait sur un accommodement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui prenait part \u00e0 une longue bataille pour la garde de ses enfants devant la Cour. On a accord\u00e9 du temps de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 cette personne pour cette raison.\n[153] M\u00eame si le Tribunal acceptait l'argument selon lequel la Compagnie avait des mesures d' accommodement appropri\u00e9es en accordant \u00e0 la plaignante plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, le d\u00e9faut de la Compagnie de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations proc\u00e9durales d\u00e9coulant du devoir d'accommodement aurait en soi constitu\u00e9 une violation des droits de la personne de la plaignante. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu que tant le processus de d\u00e9cision que la d\u00e9cision finale doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s lorsqu'on analyse une EPJ. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 66 : il peut souvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utile, en pratique, d'examiner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, d'abord, la proc\u00e9dure, s'il en est, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l'accommodement, et, ensuite, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte ou, subsidiairement, celle des raisons pour lesquelles l'employeur n'a pas offert une telle norme. (Voir aussi Oak Bay Marina Ltd. c. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal) (no 2), 2004 BCHRT 225, aux paragraphes 84 \u00e0 86).\n[154] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lane c. ADGA Group Consultant Inc., 2007 HRTO 34, au paragraphe 150, (d\u00e9cision maintenue par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l'Ontario, Cour divisionnaire, \u00e0 [2008] O.J. no 3076, 91 O.R. (3d) 649), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que :\n[TRADUCTION]\n[...] [L]e d\u00e9faut de respecter la dimension proc\u00e9durale de l'obligation d'accommodement est une forme de discrimination. Elle prive la personne touch\u00e9e des avantages de ce que la loi exige : la reconnaissance de l'obligation de ne pas faire preuve de discrimination et d'agir d'une telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 garantir qu'aucune discrimination n'a lieu.\n[155] Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les questions suivantes sont pertinentes quant \u00e0 l'analyse de la portion proc\u00e9durale du processus d'accommodement suivi par l'employeur :\nL'employeur a-t-il cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des m\u00e9thodes de rechange qui n'ont pas d'effet discriminatoire, comme les \u00e9valuations individuelles en fonction d'une norme qui tient davantage compte de l'individu? Si des normes diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et jug\u00e9es susceptibles de r\u00e9aliser l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'employeur, pourquoi n'ont-elles pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es? Est-il n\u00e9cessaire que tous les employ\u00e9s satisfassent \u00e0 la norme unique pour que l'employeur puisse r\u00e9aliser l'objet l\u00e9gitime qu'il vise, ou est-il possible d'\u00e9tablir des normes qui refl\u00e8tent les diff\u00e9rences et les capacit\u00e9s collectives ou individuelles? Y a-t-il une mani\u00e8re moins discriminatoire d'effectuer le travail tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime de l'employeur? La norme est-elle bien con\u00e7ue pour que le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis soit atteint sans qu'un fardeau excessif ne soit impos\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux qui sont vis\u00e9s par la norme? Les autres parties qui sont tenues d'aider \u00e0 la recherche de mesures d'accommodement possibles ont-elles jou\u00e9 leur r\u00f4le?\n[156] Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la composante proc\u00e9durale de l'obligation d'accommodement, la Compagnie a l'obligation de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a examin\u00e9 et a raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 tout accommodement qui aurait r\u00e9pondu aux besoins de la plaignante.\n[157] La seule preuve qu'une \u00e9valuation d'autres formes d'accommodement ait pu se produire est le t\u00e9moignage de Kerry Morris, qui a expliqu\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait discut\u00e9, dans le contexte de la n\u00e9gociation avec le Syndicat au sujet du grief, de [TRADUCTION] mesures subsidiaires d'accommodement qui permettraient \u00e0 la plaignante et aux deux autres employ\u00e9es, CR et KW, de rester \u00e0 Jasper. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le Syndicat avait propos\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer \u00e0 Vancouver des chefs de train d'un terminal adjacent \u00e0 celui de Vancouver, mais selon M. Morris, cela n'\u00e9tait pas possible parce que tous les employ\u00e9s du terminal de Kamloops travaillaient et que le fait de les d\u00e9placer \u00e0 Vancouver ne ferait que cr\u00e9er une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Kamloops. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'une autre solution aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9placer trois autres employ\u00e9s du terminal de Jasper \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 la place de la plaignante, de KW et de CR, mais, selon lui, le Syndicat \u00e9tait d'avis que cette solution \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 la disposition d'anciennet\u00e9 de la convention collective et il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 donner son approbation. Autrement, il n'existait aucune preuve que la Compagnie avait examin\u00e9 d'autres approches pour r\u00e9gler la situation de la plaignante. De plus, la preuve montre que les options n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es qu'apr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante. Le Tribunal note aussi que cette preuve ne correspond pas \u00e0 celle donn\u00e9e au m\u00eame sujet dans les affaires Richards et Whyte.\n[158] La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi que la Compagnie n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 ses propres directives et politiques d'accommodement. La Compagnie a une politique d'accommodement tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te. Cette politique reconna\u00eet tous les motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP, y compris la situation de famille, et la politique indique clairement que, lorsque cela est possible, les politiques et les pratiques d'emploi doivent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es afin qu'[TRADUCTION] aucune personne ne se voie refuser d'occasion d'emploi. Elle pr\u00e9cise aussi que l'accommodement [TRADUCTION] signifie le fait de d\u00e9ployer tous les efforts possibles pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins raisonnables des employ\u00e9s.\n[159] Les [TRADUCTION] directives d'accommodement de la Compagnie expliquent que l'objectif de la politique est [TRADUCTION] de garantir que les conditions de travail ne sont pas un obstacle \u00e0 l'emploi. Elles \u00e9tablissent aussi clairement que la Compagnie doit faire preuve de souplesse pour \u00e9liminer les obstacles et qu'elle devrait d\u00e9ployer [TRADUCTION] tous les efforts pour garantir que personne n'est d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 en raison d'une exigence ou d'un besoin sp\u00e9cial.\n[160] La politique d\u00e9finit aussi le processus \u00e0 suivre dans le cas d'une demande d'accommodement pour l'un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP et fournit une liste de v\u00e9rification que les gestionnaires et les superviseurs doivent suivre dans le cas d'une telle demande. La politique explique :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 faire lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 signale un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial est de rencontrer cette personne. Permettez \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter le probl\u00e8me ou le besoin, posez lui des questions pour bien comprendre la demande et discutez ensemble de solutions possibles.\nSi aucune solution ne peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on, ne rejetez pas la demande imm\u00e9diatement. Demandez des conseils, tentez d'obtenir d'autres solutions au probl\u00e8me et \u00e9valuez les r\u00e9percussions de tout accommodement possible aupr\u00e8s des personnes appropri\u00e9es, y compris le service du personnel, entre autres. L'employ\u00e9 a la responsabilit\u00e9 de participer activement au processus et de faciliter l'accommodement raisonnable. Les syndicats ont aussi un r\u00f4le et une responsabilit\u00e9 importants et reconnus dans l'accommodement des besoins des employ\u00e9s.\nIl est extr\u00eamement important de garder des dossiers de la r\u00e9union, des diverses solutions propos\u00e9es et des arguments utilis\u00e9s pour accepter ou rejeter chaque option. Ces renseignements sont indispensables en cas de plainte.\nAvisez rapidement la personne en question de la d\u00e9cision prise, en expliquant les raisons de la d\u00e9cision. Dans le cas du rejet d'une demande d'accommodement, l'employ\u00e9 peut avoir le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief en fonction de la proc\u00e9dure de grief appropri\u00e9e ou de pr\u00e9senter une plainte en vertu de la LCDP.\n[161] La personne responsable de la politique d'accommodement au bureau d'Edmonton de la Compagnie est, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mary-Jane Morrison, une agente des ressources humaines. C'est elle que consultent les personnes qui ont des questions au sujet de la politique ou de sa proc\u00e9dure. Mme Morrison n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. La Compagnie a plut\u00f4t appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner Stephanie Ziemer, l'agente des ressources humaines \u00e0 Vancouver. Mme Ziemer n'a pas directement particip\u00e9 dans le cas de la plaignante et n'avait aucune connaissance personnelle de la situation, mais elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle se serait attendue \u00e0 ce que la politique soit respect\u00e9e et qu'[TRADUCTION] \u00e0 un certain moment, on ait demand\u00e9 la participation des ressources humaines. Aucune preuve de la participation des ressources humaines n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\n[162] Les t\u00e9moignages des autres t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie montrent aussi clairement qu'ils \u00e9taient d'avis qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e0 appliquer la politique d'accommodement. Par exemple, M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en contre-interrogatoire qu'il savait que la Compagnie avait une politique d'accommodement en 2005, bien qu'il ait ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'avait jamais re\u00e7u de formation officielle \u00e0 ce sujet. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de confirmer s'il existait une formation [TRADUCTION] interne sur l'application de la LCDP pour les gestionnaires et les superviseurs, bien qu'il ait ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait certain qu'une telle formation avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 exist\u00e9. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'au long de sa carri\u00e8re, il avait trait\u00e9 les questions d'accommodement dans divers griefs et lors de discussions avec le Syndicat.\n[163] Lorsque l'avocat de la Compagnie lui a demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait au courant de l'obligation d'accommodement pr\u00e9vue par la LCDP, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] Non, pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment. Je sais qu'elle existe et si je devais r\u00e9gler une telle question, je renverrais l'employ\u00e9 aux ressources humaines. En contre-interrogatoire, elle a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] J'en avais connaissance, mais je n'en connaissais pas les particularit\u00e9s. De notre c\u00f4t\u00e9, nous traitons la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et lorsqu'une mesure d'accommodement est prise, les ressources humaines et la Division nous disent d'ajuster la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. C'est l\u00e0 mon domaine de responsabilit\u00e9. J'aurais simplement laiss\u00e9 la question \u00e0 M. Pizziol. Je ne sais pas ce qu'il en aurait fait. Il aurait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 voir son patron, il aurait pu choisir plusieurs avenues et je n'en ai aucune id\u00e9e, vous devriez demander \u00e0 M. Pizziol. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] M. Pizziol n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[164] Ron Morrese, le superviseur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des op\u00e9rations, un gestionnaire principal de la Compagnie, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait probablement vu la politique d'accommodement, bien qu'il ne se souvienne pas des d\u00e9tails. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 dans le secteur des [TRADUCTION] op\u00e9rations et que les ressources humaines s'occupaient de la politique. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que les ressources humaines avaient le pouvoir de dire aux [TRADUCTION] op\u00e9rations ce qu'il fallait faire dans ces cas.\n[165] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, dans sa situation, la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais eu de r\u00e9union avec son superviseur, le coordonnateur de trains \u00e0 Jasper, et qu'elle n'avait jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse aux lettres qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 son superviseur ou aux gestionnaires de la Compagnie dans lesquelles elle expliquait sa situation. Rien ne donnait non plus \u00e0 penser qu'elle avait eu une r\u00e9union avec quelqu'un des ressources humaines ou qu'on l'avait aiguill\u00e9e vers une telle personne. La preuve montre clairement que la Compagnie n'a pas respect\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans sa propre politique et qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation de famille, du moins en ce qui a trait aux obligations et aux responsabilit\u00e9s parentales, n'\u00e9tait pas un motif de discrimination pour lequel des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9taient requises. Il est aussi clair que la Compagnie n'a jamais effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de la plaignante, comme elle devait le faire.\n[166] J'examinerai maintenant bri\u00e8vement la position de la Compagnie au sujet du fait qu'il s'agirait d'une contrainte excessive si l'on accordait \u00e0 la plaignante le redressement qu'elle demande, parce qu'elle obtiendrait alors une super anciennet\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le simple fait qu'elle estun parent.\n[167] Selon Stephanie Ziemer, la Compagnie ne garde pas de renseignements au sujet du nombre de ses employ\u00e9s qui ont des enfants. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la seule fa\u00e7on d'obtenir ces renseignements serait d'examiner le dossier de chaque employ\u00e9 pour voir le nom des personnes que les employ\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u00e0 leur charge. Mme Ziemer a aussi ajout\u00e9 que selon le r\u00e9gime de prestations d'assurance de groupe des employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie [TRADUCTION] nous pouvons d\u00e9duire qu'environ 68 p. 100 de l'effectif [de la Compagnie] ont des enfants. Cette preuve partiale est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante par rapport \u00e0 la preuve que la Compagnie devrait produire pour justifier l'acte discriminatoire, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, en fonction du crit\u00e8re de l'EPJ en trois parties de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[168] La Compagnie n'a produit aucune preuve permettant de conclure que le fait d'accommoder la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive. Au contraire, en contre-interrogeant Mme Storms, l'avocat de la Compagnie a pos\u00e9 la question suivante : [TRADUCTION] si Mme Seeley s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver en 2005, est-ce que la p\u00e9nurie aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue?. Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Non, la p\u00e9nurie n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue, mais chaque personne compte. Nous aurions eu une personne de plus pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie et nous aurions utilis\u00e9 un gestionnaire de moins au triage. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[169] De plus, si le Tribunal acceptait l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel, en raison du fait que la grande majorit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s ont des enfants, le fait d'accommoder la plaignante lui causerait des contraintes excessives, cela signifierait que tout environnement de travail o\u00f9 un grand nombre de personnes font partie d'un groupe qui poss\u00e8de l'une des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP serait automatiquement exempt\u00e9 de l'application de la loi. Par exemple, cela signifie que des femmes qui travaillent dans un milieu o\u00f9 la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s sont des femmes ne pourraient pas pr\u00e9senter une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Le fait d'accepter l'argument de la Compagnie aurait l'effet de rendre impossible la pr\u00e9sentation d'une plainte fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille - du moins, les questions de situation de famille qui comprennent les obligations et les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales - parce que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s dans l'effectif ont des enfants et pourraient aussi suivre la m\u00eame route.\n[170] La Compagnie n'a produit aucune preuve permettant de conclure qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inond\u00e9e de demandes d'accommodement de la part de personnes dans la m\u00eame situation que la plaignante. Seulement deux autres plaintes, celles de CR et de KW, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites. Dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 41, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans le contexte de l'accommodement la preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impressions, d'une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. Dans la d\u00e9cision Lane, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 117, la Cour divisionnaire de l'Ontario a ajout\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nOn ne peut pas \u00e9tablir une contrainte excessive en se fondant sur une preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions ou d'anecdotes, ou de justifications apr\u00e8s le fait. Les contraintes anticip\u00e9es caus\u00e9es par une proposition d'accommodement ne devraient pas \u00eatre maintenues si elles ne sont fond\u00e9es que sur des pr\u00e9occupations hypoth\u00e9tiques ou non corrobor\u00e9es que certaines cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pourraient s'ensuivre si des mesures d'accommodement sont prises pour le plaignant.\n[171] Peu importe le fondement particulier de l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel elle subira des contraintes excessives, il est bien \u00e9tabli que l'analyse des contraintes excessives doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans le contexte d'une demande d'accommodement individuelle. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 19, l'accommodement doit \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 la norme m\u00eame afin de garantir que chaque personne est \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction de ses propres habilet\u00e9s personnelles, plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9e en fonction de caract\u00e9ristiques de groupe pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es, qui sont souvent fond\u00e9es sur un parti pris et des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'\u00e9valuation individuelle d'un employ\u00e9 est une \u00e9tape essentielle dans le processus d'accommodement, \u00e0 moins que cette \u00e9valuation en elle-m\u00eame constitue une contrainte excessive pour l'intim\u00e9e (voir Grismer, aux paragraphes 22, 30, 32 et 38; Meiorin, au paragraphe 65; Audet c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 25, au paragraphe 61 et Knight c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de l'Outaouais, 2007 TCDP 15, au paragraphe 72). Une fois de plus, cette \u00e9valuation individuelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e dans le cas de la plaignante.\n[172] \u00c0 mon avis, les arguments selon lesquels la prise de mesures d'accommodement pour une personne aurait donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une [TRADUCTION] avalanche de demandes de la part d'autres employ\u00e9s sont inacceptables. Comme la Human Rights and Citizenship Commission de l'Alberta l'a not\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision Rawleigh c. Canada Safeway Ltd, rendue le 29 septembre 2009, [TRADUCTION] chaque affaire doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres. Le fait d'appuyer la croyance qu'une avalanche pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e par des personnes opportunistes est tr\u00e8s dangereux et possiblement discriminatoire.\n[173] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Compagnie n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve voulant que le fait de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante lui causerait une contrainte excessive en ce qui a trait aux co\u00fbts. La seule preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet des co\u00fbts portait sur la formation des chefs de train et il n'y a eu aucune tentative de lier cette preuve \u00e0 la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il faut se souvenir que, pour que les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accommodement soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s excessifs, ils doivent \u00eatre importants. Dans la d\u00e9cision Quesnel c. London Educational Health Centre (1995), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/474 (Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 59 : [TRADUCTION] les co\u00fbts constituent une contrainte excessive seulement s'ils changent la nature essentielle de l'entreprise responsable de l'accommodement ou en changent de fa\u00e7on importante la viabilit\u00e9. La Compagnie a reconnu ce fait dans sa propre politique d'accommodement, qui pr\u00e9cise : [TRADUCTION] Les co\u00fbts encourus doivent \u00eatre extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9s avant que le refus d'accommodement puisse \u00eatre justifi\u00e9. Le fardeau de justifier le refus revient \u00e0 l'employeur. Les co\u00fbts doivent \u00eatre quantifiables et doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accommodement. Les r\u00e9novations ou l'\u00e9quipement sp\u00e9cial peuvent \u00eatre dispendieux, mais il est parfois possible d'obtenir une aide financi\u00e8re de diverses organisations.\ne) Conclusion [174] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le Tribunal conclut que la preuve a \u00e9tabli que la Compagnie a viol\u00e9 les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. La pratique de la Compagnie d'exiger que la plaignante se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur elle en raison de sa situation de famille. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la Compagnie a agi en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la LDCP en usant de politiques et de pratiques qui ont priv\u00e9 la plaignante d'occasions d'emploi, en raison de sa situation de famille.\nD. REDRESSEMENTS [175] La plaignante demande les redressements suivants : une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire et d'avantages sociaux, une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, les d\u00e9pens et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ainsi qu'une ordonnance la r\u00e9tablissant dans son poste \u00e0 la Compagnie avec sa pleine anciennet\u00e9, ses avantages sociaux et toutes les autres occasions ou tous les autres privil\u00e8ges dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. La CCDP demande aussi une ordonnance selon laquelle la Compagnie doit cesser tout comportement ou toutes pratiques discriminatoires et doit r\u00e9viser sa politique d'accommodement.\n(i) Une ordonnance visant \u00e0 ce que la Compagnie r\u00e9vise sa politique d'accommodement [176] La CCDP demande une ordonnance, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, pour que la Compagnie prenne des mesures, en consultation avec la CCDP, afin de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d'accommodement appropri\u00e9es pour ses employ\u00e9s en raison de la situation de famille, y compris les questions d'obligations et de responsabilit\u00e9s parentales. Elle demande aussi une ordonnance pour qu'une formation appropri\u00e9e en droits de la personne soit mise en place pour les gestionnaires, les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines et le personnel de gestion des \u00e9quipes de la Compagnie et que des s\u00e9ances d'information r\u00e9guli\u00e8res sur les politiques d'accommodement soient offertes afin d'\u00e9liminer les attitudes et les pr\u00e9somptions discriminatoires li\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de discrimination.\n[177] Bien que le Tribunal reconnaisse que la Compagnie a une bonne politique d'accommodement, il est clair qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e ou mise en uvre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 la situation de famille constitue un motif de discrimination. Les gestionnaires et les superviseurs de la Compagnie n'ont pas respect\u00e9 la politique dans le cas de la plaignante. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, je conclus que la demande de la CCDP est justifi\u00e9e.\n[178] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de travailler en collaboration avec la CCDP afin de garantir que la pratique et le comportement discriminatoires ne se poursuivent pas et de veiller \u00e0 ce que\nles politiques, pratiques et proc\u00e9dures appropri\u00e9es sont en place la Compagnie, en collaboration avec la CCDP, embauche les personnes appropri\u00e9es pour donner une formation en milieu de travail aux gestionnaires, aux employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines, et aux employ\u00e9s du CGE au sujet des questions de discrimination et de droits de la personne, et particuli\u00e8rement au sujet de l'accommodement pour le motif de la situation de famille.\n(ii) R\u00e9tablissement [179] La plaignante demande au Tribunal, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, d'ordonner \u00e0 la Compagnie de la r\u00e9tablir dans son poste de chef de train au sein de la Compagnie. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que, lorsque le Tribunal juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, il peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte discriminatoire l'a priv\u00e9e.\n[180] Pour que ce redressement soit appliqu\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante doit donc \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie dans son poste sans perte d'anciennet\u00e9. Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie d'affecter la plaignante \u00e0 titre de chef de train au terminal de Jasper, apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait mis \u00e0 jour, au besoin, sa fiche de r\u00e8gles et sa fiche m\u00e9dicale. Selon les faits incontest\u00e9s que la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, il y a trois dates de d\u00e9but possibles que le Tribunal pourrait utiliser pour r\u00e9tablir la plaignante. La premi\u00e8re date est celle du 1er juillet 2005, qui peut \u00eatre vue comme la date d'application de la demande de la plaignante d'\u00eatre accommod\u00e9e en \u00e9tant affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Jasper. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cette date parce que rien ne prouve que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque ou que cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une mesure d'accommodement appropri\u00e9e. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que des employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\n[181] La deuxi\u00e8me date est celle du 1er mars 2006. Selon la preuve, il s'agit de la date \u00e0 laquelle un autre employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 Jasper, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 et s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper. Comme seulement quatre employ\u00e9s de Jasper, la plaignante, CR, KW et cet autre employ\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, il pourrait \u00eatre raisonnable de s'attendre que la plaignante, CR et KW auraient aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper vers mars 2006. Une fois de plus, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite qui montrait que plus d'un employ\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque et il m'est difficile de conclure que cette date est appropri\u00e9e.\n[182] Enfin, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 selon lequel en mars 2007, la Compagnie a embauch\u00e9 trente-neuf (39) nouveaux chefs de train \u00e0 Jasper et qu'un grand nombre de ces nouveaux chefs de train ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est raisonnable de conclure que la plaignante avait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, une priorit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 sur ces nouveaux chefs de train et qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper avant eux. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus, au vu de cette preuve, que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e en mars 2007, et cette date est donc retenue pour son r\u00e9tablissement. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9, comme l'anciennet\u00e9 continue m\u00eame lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est en mise \u00e0 pied, elle continuera de s'accumuler comme s'il n'y avait jamais eu de rupture dans sa relation avec la Compagnie en juillet 2005.\n(iii) Indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire [183] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour tout le salaire et les avantages qu'elle a perdus, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de ma conclusion au sujet de la date de r\u00e9tablissement, j'ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour toute perte de salaire et d'avantages \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2007 jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. J'ordonne aux parties de calculer le montant du salaire en fonction de la formule pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. En ce qui a trait aux paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'un chef de train peut recevoir, comme il serait difficile pour le Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir un montant, le Tribunal ordonne aux parties qu'elles \u00e9tablissent ce montant en examinant les montants suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un conducteur travaillant dans le terminal qui aurait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable, en supposant que le chef de train n'avait pas d'absences inhabituelles. Par exemple, les parties pourraient tenir compte des paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006.\n[184] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de l'att\u00e9nuation des dommages, il ne fait aucun doute que la plaignante avait un devoir d'att\u00e9nuation. Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement de la Compagnie en 2005, elle a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 divers endroits, par exemple, comme serveuse dans un restaurant ou comme pourvoyeuse, mais elle n'a pas pu donner de liste pr\u00e9cise de tous ses emplois. De fa\u00e7on surprenante, elle n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure de donner de montant pour son revenu au cours de ces ann\u00e9es. Elle a dit qu'elle travaillait essentiellement pour les pourboires et qu'elle ne recevait pas de salaire ou qu'elle \u00e9tait pay\u00e9e en argent comptant. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'en raison du jeune \u00e2ge de ses enfants, elle n'avait pas tent\u00e9 de se trouver un autre emploi pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante au sujet de ses efforts pour att\u00e9nuer ses dommages n'\u00e9tait pas tr\u00e8s convaincant et, au mieux, montrait que, pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle n'avait pas d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 beaucoup d'efforts pour trouver un autre revenu.\n[185] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus qu'il serait raisonnable de r\u00e9duire de trente pourcent (30 p. 100) le montant accord\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\n(iv) Pr\u00e9judice moral [186] Le paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que la victime a subi en raison de la pratique discriminatoire, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $.\n[187] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que toute la situation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s troublante et qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] J'avais perdu ma carri\u00e8re. J'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9e parce que j'avais des enfants. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la lettre de cong\u00e9diement de juillet 2005, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9prim\u00e9e : [TRADUCTION] J'\u00e9tais sous le choc et \u00e7a m'a beaucoup affect\u00e9e. Ma famille a remarqu\u00e9 les changements. J'\u00e9tais irritable. Je me sentais bafou\u00e9e, comme si j'avais \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e sans consid\u00e9ration.\n[188] Son mari a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] bless\u00e9e, boulevers\u00e9e et irritable.\n[189] Aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'appui de ces pr\u00e9tentions. N\u00e9anmoins, je conviens que le comportement et l'attitude nonchalante de la Compagnie envers la situation de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s troublant pour cette derni\u00e8re et qu'elle a d\u00fb \u00eatre boulevers\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de payer \u00e0 la plaignante 15 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(v) Acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 [190] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire lorsque la pratique discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $.\n[191] Je conviens que le comportement de la Compagnie en l'esp\u00e8ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. La Compagnie avait adopt\u00e9 une politique d'accommodement, dans les directives en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement, qui \u00e9tablit les proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 suivre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui a besoin d'accommodement. Cette politique a clairement cibl\u00e9 la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination. Pourtant, la Compagnie et les gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs qui ont agi dans cette affaire ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper de la situation de famille et n'ont pas tenu compte de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par la politique. Ils n'ont fait aucun effort pour essayer de comprendre la situation de la plaignante. Ils n'ont pas tenu compte de ses lettres et ils ont choisi les motifs de discrimination pour lesquels ils devaient prendre des mesures d'accommodement et pour lesquels ils croyaient que de telles mesures n'\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessaires. Ces actes, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9taient inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[192] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de payer \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 20 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n(vi) D\u00e9pens et int\u00e9r\u00eats. [193] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal accorde les d\u00e9pens. Depuis la fin de l'audience, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rendu une d\u00e9cision dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2009 CAF 309, dans lequel les questions \u00e0 trancher \u00e9taient celles de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des d\u00e9pens et si cette comp\u00e9tence rel\u00e8ve de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, qui autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 indemniser un plaignant pour toutes les d\u00e9penses encourues en raison de l'acte discriminatoire.\n[194] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 le Code des droits de la personne de diverses provinces, qui permettait d'accorder des d\u00e9pens, et apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu au paragraphe 95 :\nLa recherche vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le l\u00e9gislateur voulait investir le Tribunal du pouvoir d'accorder des d\u00e9pens au plaignant ayant gain de cause. Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci dessus, je conclus que le l\u00e9gislateur n'avait pas l'intention d'investir, et n'a pas investi, le Tribunal du pouvoir d'accorder des d\u00e9pens. Conclure que le Tribunal peut accorder des d\u00e9pens au titre des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte aurait pour effet d'introduire indirectement dans la Loi un pouvoir qui ne correspondait pas \u00e0 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[195] Tenant compte de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Tribunal ne peut pas accueillir la demande de la plaignante quant \u00e0 l'ordonnance que la Compagnie lui paie ses d\u00e9pens.\n[196] En ce qui a trait aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, ils sont exigibles pour toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP). Il s'agit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s annuellement, \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d'escompte (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP) et \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3)), les int\u00e9r\u00eats commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 parti partir de la date de la plainte.\nSign\u00e9e par Michel Doucet OTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 29 septembre 2010\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1355\/8508\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nDenise Seeley c.

INTRODUCTION [1] Il s'agit d'une plainte de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d'emploi fond\u00e9e sur les articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Cindy Richards (la plaignante) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte dans laquelle elle all\u00e9guait que l'intim\u00e9e, la Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (la Compagnie), avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en raison de sa situation de famille en ne prenant pas de mesure d'accommodement pour elle et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n[2] La Compagnie nie les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante.\n[3] Toutes les parties, y compris la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la CCDP), \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l'audience et \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par un avocat.\n[4] Deux autres plaintes semblables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre la Compagnie. Par entente entre les parties, le cas de Denise Seeley c. CN a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 dans une audience distincte qui a eu lieu avant la pr\u00e9sente. Bien que les plaintes de Cindy Richards et de Kasha A. Whyte aient \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues ensemble, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu pendant une conf\u00e9rence de gestion du cas que les plaintes seraient tranch\u00e9es dans deux d\u00e9cisions diff\u00e9rentes.\n[5] Bien que les faits dans l'affaire Seeley et ceux dans les affaires Richards et Whyte soient tr\u00e8s semblables et que les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie soient les m\u00eames, \u00e0 l'exception de Cathy Smolynek, qui a seulement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans les deux derni\u00e8res affaires, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l'affaire Seeley et dans les affaires Richards et Whyte est, en de nombreux points, diff\u00e9rente. Sans n\u00e9cessairement se contredire, les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie qui avaient t\u00e9moign\u00e9 auparavant dans l'affaire Seeley n'ont pas r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 exactement le m\u00eame t\u00e9moignage dans les affaires Richards et Whyte. De plus, des documents qui n'avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience de l'affaire Seeley ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve dans les affaires Richards et Whyte. Ces diff\u00e9rences expliqueront toute divergence qui puisse exister dans les faits des affaires Richards et Whyte en comparaison avec la d\u00e9cision Seeley.\nA. LES FAITS (i) La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada a) Renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux [6] La Compagnie est une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 sous r\u00e9glementation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui tire ses revenus du transport de biens par train. Il s'agit d'une compagnie de chemins de fer transcontinentale qui op\u00e8re au Canada et aux \u00c9tats Unis. Les trains de marchandises transportent des biens 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, 365 jours par ann\u00e9e.\n[7] La Compagnie a plus de 15 000 employ\u00e9s au Canada. Ces employ\u00e9s sont organis\u00e9s en deux groupes distincts d\u00e9crits comme un groupe op\u00e9rationnel et un groupe non op\u00e9rationnel. Le groupe non op\u00e9rationnel est constitu\u00e9 d'employ\u00e9s qui occupent des postes en administration, en m\u00e9canique et en ing\u00e9nierie. Les employ\u00e9s du groupe op\u00e9rationnel, aussi connus sous le nom de personnel des trains, sont des chefs de train et des m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives.\n[8] La Compagnie compte plus de 4 000 employ\u00e9s du personnel des trains \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du Canada, dont 2 400 sont des chefs de train. Selon Mme Stephanie Ziemer, une agente des ressources humaines de la Compagnie \u00e0 Vancouver, le nombre de chefs de train en 2005 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, soit 2 500 employ\u00e9s.\n[9] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question de l'avocat de la Compagnie, Mme Ziemer a expliqu\u00e9 que la Compagnie ne fait pas de suivi au sujet du nombre de ses employ\u00e9s qui ont des enfants. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que ce renseignement ne peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9 que lorsque l'employ\u00e9 s'inscrit aux prestations d'assurance collective de la Compagnie. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] selon ces renseignements, environ 69 p. 100 de nos employ\u00e9s ont des enfants. D'apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, cette information aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 jour en mai 2009. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle [TRADUCTION] estimerait que ce pourcentage est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 parce que ce ne sont pas tous les employ\u00e9s qui participent aux prestations d'assurance collective, en particulier s'ils ont un \u00e9poux qui a une assurance collective \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de la Compagnie.\n[10] Lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante lui a pos\u00e9 des questions au sujet de la fiabilit\u00e9 de ces chiffres, Mme Ziemer a expliqu\u00e9 qu'ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis par le gestionnaire de l'administration des prestations de la Compagnie \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. L'avocat de la Compagnie a ensuite montr\u00e9 aux avocats de la plaignante et de la CCDP ce que l'avocate de la plaignante a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] un gros paquet de noms \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s en fonction de ce qui semble \u00eatre un ordre par num\u00e9ro d'employ\u00e9. Bien que cette liste identifiait les chefs de train et leurs personnes \u00e0 charge, l'avocate de la plaignante a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'y avait [TRADUCTION] rien au sujet d'un taux de 69 p. 100. Elle a donc conclu que [TRADUCTION] quelqu'un devait avoir pris ce document et avoir fait des calculs. Elle a alors demand\u00e9 que les documents sur lesquels les calculs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits soient produits en preuve.\n[11] M. Paquette, l'avocat de la Compagnie, a expliqu\u00e9 que les calculs avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits par [TRADUCTION] quelqu'un au service juridique de la Compagnie. Il a alors ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s probable que cette personne avait communiqu\u00e9 ces chiffres au t\u00e9moin. Lorsque le membre pr\u00e9sident a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocat si, lorsque Mme Ziemer avait mentionn\u00e9 que les chiffres lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s par quelqu'un \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, elle parlait du service juridique, l'avocat a r\u00e9pondu [TRADUCTION] tr\u00e8s probablement, mais il a ajout\u00e9 que l'information m\u00eame provenait du service des ressources humaines de la Compagnie. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait simplement d'une question de [TRADUCTION] s'asseoir et proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'addition un par un.\n[12] En contre interrogatoire, Mme Ziemer a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas effectu\u00e9 les calculs elle m\u00eame. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le taux de 69 p. 100 pour les deux groupes lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 au cours d'une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, mais elle \u00e9tait incapable de se souvenir du nom de la personne qui lui avait donn\u00e9 l'information. Au sujet du [TRADUCTION] gros paquet de noms, Mme Ziemer a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle avait vu ce document pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 l'audience. Compte tenu des explications de Mme Ziemer, le Tribunal accordera peu de poids \u00e0 cette partie de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[13] Pour des raisons op\u00e9rationnelles, la Compagnie est divis\u00e9e en deux grandes r\u00e9gions, la r\u00e9gion de l'Est et la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. La r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest comprend tous les terminaux ferroviaires de la Compagnie \u00e0 partir de Vancouver (Colombie Britannique) jusqu'\u00e0 Thunder Bay (Ontario).\n[14] Le Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes (le CGE) \u00e0 Edmonton est une partie tr\u00e8s importante des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie. Il est responsable de tous les appels des \u00e9quipes et les d\u00e9ploiements pour la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Il g\u00e8re le d\u00e9ploiement du personnel des trains et la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, dont le budget total est de 204 millions de dollars. Le CGE est compos\u00e9 de cinquante quatre (54) employ\u00e9s qui rel\u00e8vent d'Elaine Storms, la directrice du CGE. Mme Storms occupait ce poste en 2005 et elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin important pour la Compagnie \u00e0 l'audience.\n[15] La Compagnie a aussi un [TRADUCTION] service du personnel qui comprend les ressources humaines et les relations de travail. Bien que ces deux groupes rel\u00e8vent du m\u00eame service, ils ont des fonctions tr\u00e8s distinctes. Les ressources humaines traitent, entre autres, des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, alors que les relations de travail traitent des questions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la convention collective. En 2005, Mary Jane Morrison \u00e9tait la personne aux ressources humaines en charge du portefeuille du personnel des trains \u00e0 Jasper.\nb) Le personnel des trains [16] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives et les chefs de train font partie du groupe portant le nom de personnel des trains. Les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives font fonctionner le moteur et les chefs de train sont, au fond, responsables de tous les autres aspects li\u00e9s au mouvement du train.\n[17] Le personnel des trains travaille soit sur la [TRADUCTION] route ou au [TRADUCTION] triage. Le [TRADUCTION] travail de route est effectu\u00e9 par des employ\u00e9s qui embarquent dans un train \u00e0 un terminal en particulier et qui am\u00e8nent le train \u00e0 un autre terminal. Un employ\u00e9 de triage travaille g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la gare de triage, transf\u00e9rant les wagons couverts et embo\u00eetant les trains. Un employ\u00e9 de triage n'a pas besoin de quitter le terminal.\n[18] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'embauche, la Compagnie a tendance \u00e0 embaucher son personnel des trains en groupes. Selon Mme Ziemer, la Compagnie a embauch\u00e9 beaucoup d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 70 et [TRADUCTION] un peu d'employ\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es 80 et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une [TRADUCTION] embauche importante de 2005 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de 2009.\n[19] En 1996, le pourcentage de femmes dans le personnel des trains \u00e9tait d'environ 3 p. 100. Cette donn\u00e9e \u00e9tait de 3,7 p. 100 en 2006 et se situe maintenant \u00e0 environ 3,1 p. 100.\n[20] Le co\u00fbt pour la formation d'un chef de train est d'environ 50 000 $ \u00e0 80 000 $. Ce montant comprend le salaire de l'employ\u00e9 et de l'instructeur et aussi, si n\u00e9cessaire, leur h\u00e9bergement. La formation prend de quatre (4) \u00e0 six (6) mois. Le co\u00fbt de la formation d'un m\u00e9canicien de locomotives est d'environ 28 000 $ \u00e0 30 000 $, en plus du co\u00fbt de sa formation comme chef de train.\n[21] Afin de se qualifier pour travailler comme chef de train, un employ\u00e9 doit faire mettre \u00e0 jour sa fiche de r\u00e8gles et sa fiche m\u00e9dicale. Ces fiches doivent \u00eatre renouvel\u00e9es tous les trois ans. Si un employ\u00e9 est au tableau de service, il recevra g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement un avis lui disant que ses fiches expireront bient\u00f4t et il n'a qu'\u00e0 prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour les faire mettre \u00e0 jour. Si l'employ\u00e9 est en mise \u00e0 pied, il devra le faire lui m\u00eame, bien que pour la fiche de r\u00e8gles, il aura besoin de l'approbation de son superviseur.\n[22] Lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 travaille ou est disponible pour travailler, on dit qu'il est au [TRADUCTION] tableau de service. Le tableau de service comprend tous les employ\u00e9s qui ne sont pas mis \u00e0 pied. Les employ\u00e9s qui sont au tableau de service sont soit en affectation, soit dans un bassin.\n[23] Un employ\u00e9 peut aussi \u00eatre affect\u00e9, ce qui signifie qu'il sera au tableau de service \u00e0 son terminal. La d\u00e9cision d'affecter un employ\u00e9 est prise par le gestionnaire du terminal. Cette d\u00e9cision est fond\u00e9e sur le nombre d'employ\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires au terminal pour effectuer le travail pr\u00e9vu.\n[24] Il y a aussi un autre tableau, qui fait partie du tableau de service et qui porte le nom de [TRADUCTION] tableau de remplacement ou de [TRADUCTION] tableau d'urgence. Les employ\u00e9s dont le nom figure \u00e0 ce tableau sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler seulement pour remplacer des employ\u00e9s qui sont soit en vacances, soit incapables de travailler pour d'autres raisons.\n[25] En raison de la nature des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie, le personnel des trains doit \u00eatre disponible pour travailler \u00e0 l'endroit et au moment requis, dans le respect des restrictions impos\u00e9es par la loi et par la convention collective. Compte tenu de ces exigences, la Compagnie est d'avis que la mobilit\u00e9 et la flexibilit\u00e9 constituent des conditions d'emploi de base pour ces employ\u00e9s. Elle est d'avis que ces exigences sont n\u00e9cessaires compte tenu du volume de biens que la Compagnie transporte et de la fluctuation en mati\u00e8re de demande qui peut exister pendant une courte p\u00e9riode en raison, par exemple, de changements dans l'\u00e9conomie ou de facteurs saisonniers tels que la saison de la moisson du grain.\n[26] L'horaire de travail d'un chef de train est tr\u00e8s impr\u00e9visible. Selon le tableau auquel le chef de train est inscrit, il a plus ou moins de connaissances au sujet du type de travail qu'il pourrait avoir \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter. Par cons\u00e9quent, toutes les affectations de travail sur la route ont des horaires enti\u00e8rement impr\u00e9visibles. On s'attend \u00e0 ce qu'un chef de train soit en mesure de se pr\u00e9senter au travail dans les deux heures suivant la r\u00e9ception d'un appel du CGE. Lorsqu'un chef de train se pr\u00e9sente au travail, il n'a aucune id\u00e9e du moment exact o\u00f9 il retournera \u00e0 la maison. Il peut \u00eatre parti pendant quelques heures, jusqu'\u00e0 presque deux jours.\n[27] Le travail du personnel des trains est fond\u00e9 sur le millage. Le tableau de service est ajust\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on hebdomadaire afin que chaque employ\u00e9 puisse faire environ 4 300 milles par mois. Lorsque la Compagnie ajuste le tableau de service, elle examine les donn\u00e9es de la semaine pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente afin de voir combien de milles les employ\u00e9s ont effectu\u00e9s. Elle divise ce nombre par 4 300 et le r\u00e9sultat indique le nombre d'employ\u00e9s qui serait probablement n\u00e9cessaire dans un terminal en particulier la semaine suivante.\n[28] Pendant toutes les p\u00e9riodes en cause, les chefs de train dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest du Canada \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les Travailleurs unis du transport (le Syndicat). La convention collective applicable aux chefs de train dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest est la convention collective 4.3 (la convention collective).\nc) Les changements effectu\u00e9s en 1992 et la cr\u00e9ation du tableau de cong\u00e9s [29] En 1992, des changements dans la technologie ont permis \u00e0 la Compagnie d'\u00e9liminer le wagon \u00e0 la fin du train, qui est commun\u00e9ment connu sous le nom de wagon de queue. Cette d\u00e9cision a entra\u00een\u00e9 l'\u00e9limination du poste de serre frein. Apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision, les chefs de train qui travaillaient dans le wagon de queue ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avant du train avec les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives. L'\u00e9limination du poste de serre frein signifiait que la Compagnie avait besoin de moins de personnel des trains pour faire fonctionner ses trains. La r\u00e9duction dans le nombre d'employ\u00e9s a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e pendant le processus de n\u00e9gociation avec le Syndicat. La n\u00e9gociation a entra\u00een\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation du [TRADUCTION] tableau de cong\u00e9s.\n[30] Un tableau de cong\u00e9s est cr\u00e9\u00e9 lorsqu'il y a un surplus d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 un terminal, mais pas suffisamment de travail pour tous. L'employ\u00e9 dont le nom figure au tableau de cong\u00e9s doit rester disponible pour le travail, mais s'il n'est pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler, il re\u00e7oit tout de m\u00eame son salaire. Seule une certaine cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s peut soumissionner pour le tableau de cong\u00e9s. Ces employ\u00e9s portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, alors que les employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s ne peuvent pas s'inscrire au tableau de cong\u00e9s.\n[31] Les changements effectu\u00e9s aux conditions de travail en 1992 ont aussi cr\u00e9\u00e9 la notion de [TRADUCTION] for\u00e7age, qui produit diff\u00e9rents r\u00e9sultats pour diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories d'employ\u00e9s dans le personnel des trains. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 148.11 de la convention collective, les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s le 29 juin 1990 peuvent \u00eatre forc\u00e9s de travailler dans un autre terminal dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest et ont l'obligation de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 ce terminal au plus tard dans les trente (30) jours suivant l'appel, \u00e0 moins qu'ils ne pr\u00e9sentent une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier le fait qu'ils ne se pr\u00e9senteront pas. Ces employ\u00e9s sont commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie D. Ils sont aussi appel\u00e9s employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, parce qu'ils ont l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un appel au travail \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de leur terminal.\n[32] L'autre cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s comprend les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant le 29 juin 1990. Ces employ\u00e9s sont appel\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Dans ce groupe d'employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, on retrouve ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s avant 1982 et qui portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie A et de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie B, respectivement. Ces employ\u00e9s ne peuvent pas \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail ailleurs qu'\u00e0 leur terminal local. Les employ\u00e9s embauch\u00e9s apr\u00e8s 1982, mais avant le 29 juin 1990, portent le nom d'employ\u00e9s de la [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9gorie C et peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 du travail \u00e0 des terminaux adjacents. Par exemple, les employ\u00e9s de la cat\u00e9gorie C du terminal de Jasper peuvent seulement \u00eatre affect\u00e9s aux terminaux adjacents d'Edson et de Kamloops.\n[33] Le statut d'employ\u00e9 prot\u00e9g\u00e9 repr\u00e9sente une exception \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Le nombre de ces employ\u00e9s diminuera au cours des ann\u00e9es simplement par l'attrition, et le statut dispara\u00eetra \u00e9ventuellement compl\u00e8tement.\n[34] \u00c0 la suite de la cr\u00e9ation du tableau de cong\u00e9s, qui essentiellement permet \u00e0 certains employ\u00e9s d'\u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 leur terminal local, la Compagnie devait trouver une fa\u00e7on de combler des postes en cas de p\u00e9nuries dans d'autres terminaux. C'est \u00e0 ce moment que la clause 148.11 de la convention collective est entr\u00e9e en vigueur. C'est cette disposition qui permet \u00e0 la Compagnie de forcer les employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 se rendre dans d'autres terminaux de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour couvrir les p\u00e9nuries.\n[35] Avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la clause 148.11, la Compagnie obtenait des employ\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie en produisant des [TRADUCTION] bulletins de p\u00e9nurie et en permettant aux employ\u00e9s de se porter volontaires en cas de p\u00e9nurie, s'ils le d\u00e9siraient. Ces bulletins \u00e9taient produits \u00e0 chaque [TRADUCTION] changement de fiche, soit environ quatre fois par ann\u00e9e. Comme il est difficile pour la Compagnie de pr\u00e9voir o\u00f9 une p\u00e9nurie aura lieu, ces bulletins couvraient divers endroits, qu'il y ait r\u00e9ellement une p\u00e9nurie ou non. Les employ\u00e9s qui souhaitaient r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie dans un certain endroit se portaient volontaires pour cet endroit, et s'il y avait une p\u00e9nurie au terminal en question, l'employ\u00e9 qui s'\u00e9tait port\u00e9 volontaire \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 aller y travailler.\n[36] La Compagnie affiche toujours des bulletins de p\u00e9nurie, et les employ\u00e9s peuvent toujours se porter volontaires suivant ces bulletins, mais comme les employ\u00e9s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s peuvent maintenant rester \u00e0 leur terminal local, au tableau de cong\u00e9s, et tout de m\u00eame recevoir leur salaire, ils n'ont gu\u00e8re d'avantage \u00e0 se porter volontaires en cas de p\u00e9nurie.\n[37] La Compagnie utilise aussi un syst\u00e8me connu sous le nom de [TRADUCTION] dotation suivant le tableau de remplacement ( en anglais, whitemanning ),, qui lui permet d'envoyer les employ\u00e9s en surplus dans un terminal \u00e0 un terminal adjacent. Par exemple, dans un tel sc\u00e9nario, des employ\u00e9s de Kamloops (C. B.) conduiraient des trains que les \u00e9quipes de Vancouver conduisent normalement jusqu'\u00e0 Kamloops. Selon Mme Storms, la [TRADUCTION] dotation suivant le tableau de remplacement est la premi\u00e8re solution que la Compagnie utilise en cas de p\u00e9nurie, parce qu'elle est beaucoup plus \u00e9conomique que celle de forcer des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie.\n[38] Il est aussi possible qu'on demande \u00e0 des gestionnaires de travailler pendant une situation de p\u00e9nurie. Presque tous les gestionnaires des transports sont qualifi\u00e9s pour conduire des trains. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Compagnie demandera aux gestionnaires de conduire des trains en dernier recours, lorsqu'elle a \u00e9puis\u00e9 le personnel des trains, y compris les employ\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied.\n[39] Les employ\u00e9s qui sont affect\u00e9s \u00e0 un autre terminal en vertu de la clause 148.11 de la convention collective ont droit \u00e0 certaines commodit\u00e9s au terminal qui leur est assign\u00e9. Ces commodit\u00e9s comprennent, lorsqu'elles sont disponibles, des chambres \u00e9quip\u00e9es d'une cuisinette et aussi la possibilit\u00e9 de retourner \u00e0 la maison \u00e0 des intervalles r\u00e9guliers ou, subsidiairement, la possibilit\u00e9 que la Compagnie d\u00e9fraie le co\u00fbt associ\u00e9 au transport d'un membre de la famille jusqu'au lieu de la p\u00e9nurie.\n[40] L'alin\u00e9a 148.11f) de la convention collective stipule que le premier employ\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie sera l'employ\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 le moins ancien qui est en mise \u00e0 pied dans le territoire d'anciennet\u00e9 et dont la date d'anciennet\u00e9 est ult\u00e9rieure au 29 juin 1990. La convention collective ne pr\u00e9voit pas de dur\u00e9e maximale pour la couverture d'une p\u00e9nurie. Si la p\u00e9nurie devient permanente, la Compagnie embauchera alors des employ\u00e9s pour le lieu touch\u00e9.\n[41] La clause 115 de la convention collective stipule qu'un employ\u00e9 qui est mis \u00e0 pied sera prioritaire pour le r\u00e9emploi si l'effectif est augment\u00e9 dans son district de s\u00e9niorit\u00e9 et qu'il reprendra du service par ordre d'anciennet\u00e9. Cette clause stipule aussi que si l'employ\u00e9 travaille ailleurs au moment du rappel, il peut obtenir trente (30) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter au travail. S'il ne se pr\u00e9sente pas au travail et qu'il ne donne pas de [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter, il renonce \u00e0 ses droits d'anciennet\u00e9.\n[42] Un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite soulever une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante pour justifier son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter au travail doit d'abord pr\u00e9senter sa demande au Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes (le CGE). On lui donne alors l'instruction d'\u00e9crire une lettre \u00e0 son superviseur imm\u00e9diat \u00e0 son terminal local. Si la raison soulev\u00e9e peut avoir des r\u00e9percussions sur la convention collective, il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire de discuter avec le Syndicat.\n(ii) La plaignante [43] La plaignante habite \u00e0 Jasper (Alberta) avec ses deux enfants. Elle a d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par la Compagnie dans la province de Qu\u00e9bec, en 1989. En 1992, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver et alors qu'elle s'y trouvait, un employ\u00e9 de la Compagnie lui a dit que les occasions de travail \u00e9taient meilleures dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 9 avril 1992, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver. Ce faisant, elle a travers\u00e9 le district d'anciennet\u00e9 entre la r\u00e9gion de l'Est et la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest et elle a perdu l'anciennet\u00e9 qu'elle avait accumul\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Est depuis 1989. Sa nouvelle date d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait maintenant 1992.\n[44] Comme elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e apr\u00e8s 1982, mais avant le 29 juin 1990, la plaignante, si elle \u00e9tait rest\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Est, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une employ\u00e9e de la cat\u00e9gorie C, ce qui aurait signifi\u00e9 qu'en cas de p\u00e9nurie, elle ne pouvait \u00eatre affect\u00e9e qu'\u00e0 un terminal adjacent. La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de ce fait lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de transf\u00e9rer \u00e0 la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest. Selon son t\u00e9moignage, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, la Compagnie et le Syndicat \u00e9taient en processus de n\u00e9gociation et aucune cat\u00e9gorie d'employ\u00e9s n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e.\n[45] Tout de suite apr\u00e8s son d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement \u00e0 Vancouver, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied et a d\u00fb r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 McClennan (Alberta). Au printemps 1993, alors qu'elle \u00e9tait enceinte de cinq (5) mois, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Edmonton. Son premier enfant est n\u00e9 le 8 septembre 1993 et son deuxi\u00e8me enfant est n\u00e9 le 30 novembre 1994.\n[46] En 1995, la plaignante et son mari, un m\u00e9canicien de locomotives aussi employ\u00e9 de la Compagnie, d\u00e9sirant une meilleure stabilit\u00e9 pour leur jeune famille, ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demander une mutation \u00e0 Jasper puisqu'il y avait une p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 ce terminal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque.\n[47] En 1997, la plaignante et son mari se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s. Leur divorce a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalis\u00e9 en 2001. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordonnance de divorce, ils partagent la garde de leurs deux enfants. La r\u00e9sidence principale des enfants est avec la plaignante.\n[48] En septembre 1998, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise \u00e0 pied de son poste de chef de train pour la Compagnie. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, les repr\u00e9sentants locaux du Syndicat \u00e0 Jasper avaient une entente locale avec la Compagnie. Cette entente permettait aux chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied inscrits au tableau d'urgence d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 travailler avant les employ\u00e9s qui \u00e9taient inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s en vigueur. De cette \u00e9poque jusqu'en 2001, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 en fonction du tableau d'urgence de Jasper, r\u00e9pondant aux appels lorsque n\u00e9cessaire. L'entente locale a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en 2001, lorsque la Compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle souhaitait \u00eatre en mesure d'appeler les employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s en vigueur avant les employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied. La Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que comme elle payait une garantie pour les employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s, mais pas aux employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied, il \u00e9tait financi\u00e8rement avantageux pour elle d'utiliser les employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s avant de rappeler les employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied pour effectuer du travail d'urgence. Apr\u00e8s ce changement, compte tenu du nombre d'employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper, il n'y a plus eu d'occasion pour un employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied qui s'\u00e9tait inscrit au tableau d'urgence d'\u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler.\n[49] La fiche de r\u00e8gles et la fiche m\u00e9dicale de la plaignante ont expir\u00e9 vers 2003. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 faire recertifier sa fiche de r\u00e8gles, mais que son superviseur \u00e0 Jasper a rejet\u00e9 sa demande.\n[50] En 2004, la plaignante a obtenu une nouvelle fiche de r\u00e8gles et a effectu\u00e9 un examen m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'emploi. \u00c0 partir de juin 2005, elle a de nouveau travaill\u00e9 pour le tableau d'urgence de Jasper. En fait, avant son cong\u00e9diement de juillet 2005, elle a travaill\u00e9 pendant 9 tours de service.\n[51] Au d\u00e9but 2005, l'a\u00een\u00e9e de la plaignante avait 11 ans et \u00e9tait en 6e ann\u00e9e. Le benjamin de la plaignante avait 10 ans et \u00e9tait en 5e ann\u00e9e. Ils fr\u00e9quentaient tous deux l'\u00e9cole \u00e0 Jasper.\n(iii) La p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver [52] En f\u00e9vrier 2005, la Compagnie subissait une importante p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 son terminal de Vancouver. Cette situation \u00e9tait due principalement \u00e0 la croissance de l'\u00e9conomie et \u00e0 l'augmentation du volume d'activit\u00e9s de la Compagnie, qui avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir suffisamment de personnel des trains localement pour g\u00e9rer le travail \u00e0 accomplir. Selon Mme Storms, soixante douze (72) chefs de train \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie et il n'y avait que cinquante trois (53) chefs de train sur place, donc il en manquait dix neuf (19). Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'[TRADUCTION] il s'agissait incontestablement de l'une des p\u00e9nuries les plus importantes que j'aie vues dans ma carri\u00e8re.\n[53] Pour accentuer l'importance de cette p\u00e9nurie, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant la p\u00e9riode du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2005 au 15 janvier 2006, \u00e0 la gare de triage de Vancouver, il y avait eu 726 quarts de travail en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, constituant une d\u00e9pense totale de 229 350,30 $. En contre interrogatoire, elle a ajout\u00e9 que ces chiffres comprenaient les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires effectu\u00e9es non seulement par les chefs de train, mais aussi par les m\u00e9caniciens de locomotives et possiblement par les chefs de triage.\n[54] Mme Storms a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que vers la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, le terminal de Jasper \u00e9tait en situation de surplus. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsque, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas \u00e0 Jasper, un terminal a un tableau de cong\u00e9s, qu'il soutient d'autres terminaux avec des employ\u00e9s dot\u00e9s en fonction du tableau de remplacement et que des employ\u00e9s sont mis \u00e0 pied, il est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00eatre en situation de surplus. Cependant, elle a reconnu qu'en 2005, les gestionnaires \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s comme chefs de train \u00e0 Jasper en raison des retards des trains. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que pendant une [TRADUCTION] partie de 2005, l'achalandage a augment\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper et qu'apr\u00e8s le 6 ao\u00fbt 2005, il n'y avait plus d'employ\u00e9s inscrits au tableau de cong\u00e9s \u00e0 cet endroit.\n[55] En raison de son emplacement, le terminal de Vancouver est tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9. Il comprend une importante gare de triage et des op\u00e9rations intermodales o\u00f9 les biens sont transf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de navires et vers les navires. Le terminal de Vancouver constitue par cons\u00e9quent un centre de liaison pour le march\u00e9 canadien de la Compagnie, parce qu'une grande quantit\u00e9 de mat\u00e9riaux et de biens de consommation provenant de l'Asie et de l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, et export\u00e9s vers l'Asie et l'Am\u00e9rique du Nord, passe par Vancouver et est ensuite transport\u00e9e partout au Canada sur le r\u00e9seau ferroviaire de la Compagnie.\n[56] Une p\u00e9nurie de personnel des trains \u00e0 Vancouver a d'importantes r\u00e9percussions, car elle peut avoir des incidences sur la capacit\u00e9 de la Compagnie \u00e0 fonctionner ad\u00e9quatement partout dans son r\u00e9seau.\n[57] Afin de maintenir son niveau d'op\u00e9ration, la Compagnie a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2005 de rappeler des chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied de la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie qui touchait le terminal de Vancouver. Ces employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s dont la date d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait ult\u00e9rieure au 29 juin 1990. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils \u00e9taient vis\u00e9s par l'alin\u00e9a 148.11c) de la convention collective.\n[58] D'apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Storms, les p\u00e9nuries sont g\u00e9r\u00e9es par le [TRADUCTION] Groupe de rajustement des tableaux du CGE. Ce groupe, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9 par Joe Lyon, qui relevait directement de Mme Storms. Le Groupe de rajustement des tableaux a g\u00e9r\u00e9 la p\u00e9nurie de 2005 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais comme il manquait d'effectif, des r\u00e9partiteurs d'\u00e9quipes ont aussi particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la communication avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n[59] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle s'\u00e9tait rendue \u00e0 Vancouver pour aider \u00e0 l'affectation des gestionnaires. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que des gestionnaires avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s de partout au Canada pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que 2 144 tours de service avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 couverts par des gestionnaires pendant la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que cela [TRADUCTION] a \u00e9t\u00e9 le recours \u00e0 des gestionnaires le plus important que j'aie vu dans l'Ouest dans ma carri\u00e8re.\n[60] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e possible de cette p\u00e9nurie, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que si la plaignante s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver, elle y serait probablement rest\u00e9e pendant environ un an, puisque la situation de p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue avant 2006.\n[61] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Ziemer, la p\u00e9nurie a \u00e9ventuellement \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue [TRADUCTION] apr\u00e8s quelques ann\u00e9es parce que la Compagnie a [TRADUCTION] embauch\u00e9 le bon nombre d'employ\u00e9s afin de tenir compte des attritions et de la croissance importante de l'entreprise. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le march\u00e9 du travail \u00e0 Vancouver est tr\u00e8s comp\u00e9titif : [TRADUCTION] Malheureusement, l'industrie de la construction \u00e9tait en pleine expansion. Nous avions aussi perdu beaucoup de candidats en raison de l'expansion de l'industrie p\u00e9troli\u00e8re dans le Nord de l'Alberta. [...] [I]l nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile de recruter pendant ces deux ann\u00e9es [2005 et 2006], et c'est devenu cyclique. Nous n'avions pas suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s retenus dans le processus de s\u00e9lection pour le recrutement, donc nous devions afficher de nouvelles offres d'emploi et tenir de nombreux salons des carri\u00e8res. Nous avons d\u00fb afficher des offres d'emploi \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que nous ayons suffisamment d'employ\u00e9s. Cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 cyclique de 2005 jusqu'\u00e0 probablement la moiti\u00e9 de 2007.\n[62] Les employ\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9sentaient au terminal de Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie devaient se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la gare de triage Thornton, \u00e0 Surrey, et de l\u00e0, comme Vancouver avait beaucoup de gares de triage, ils \u00e9taient envoy\u00e9s aux endroits o\u00f9 leurs services \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires. Les employ\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient inform\u00e9s de l'endroit o\u00f9 ils allaient travailler et du quart de travail qu'ils allaient occuper que lorsqu'ils arrivaient \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[63] Mme Ziemer a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des dispositions prises quant \u00e0 l'h\u00e9bergement pour les employ\u00e9s qui se pr\u00e9sentaient \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il y avait deux h\u00f4tels disponibles \u00e0 Surrey (C. B.). L'un de ces h\u00f4tels \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs p\u00e2t\u00e9s de maisons des gares de triage de la Compagnie. Selon les souvenirs de Mme Ziemer, cet h\u00f4tel [TRADUCTION] avait de grandes suites avec des r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateurs et il y avait une cuisine collective pour les employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie. L'autre h\u00f4tel \u00e9tait plus pr\u00e8s des gares de triage et avait aussi des suites. Mme Ziemer a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Je crois qu'il y avait aussi des cuisines dans ces suites.\n[64] Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Compagnie pouvait approuver la location d'une maison, d'un appartement ou d'une copropri\u00e9t\u00e9. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 une situation qui avait eu lieu \u00e0 Vancouver - bien qu'elle n'ait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 quel moment - lors de laquelle la Compagnie avait approuv\u00e9 la location d'une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 parce que le prix de la location \u00e9tait plus logique du point de vue \u00e9conomique que de payer [TRADUCTION] 90 $ par nuit ou 100 $ par nuit pour un h\u00f4tel pour les 20 ou 30 jours o\u00f9 l'employ\u00e9 serait sur place pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n(iv) Les chefs de train qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver [65] Quarante sept (47) chefs de train mis \u00e0 pied dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver en f\u00e9vrier 2005. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9, en commen\u00e7ant par la personne avec le plus d'anciennet\u00e9 dans le district. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie ne permettait pas \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui avait de l'anciennet\u00e9 de refuser une occasion de travailler, parce que cela signifierait qu'il ne prot\u00e9geait pas son anciennet\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la convention collective. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque du rappel, la plaignante \u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re sur la liste d'anciennet\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied au terminal de Jasper.\n[66] Des quarante-sept (47) employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s, dix (10) se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver et trente (30) ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et ont d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 ou ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s. Pour les sept (7) employ\u00e9s restants, soit ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9s du d\u00e9placement \u00e0 Vancouver, soit leurs services \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 leur terminal local.\n[67] Les quarante sept (47) employ\u00e9s ont d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 joints par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Selon Mme Storms, lorsque ces employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s, on leur a dit qu'ils avaient quinze (15) jours pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait avis\u00e9 son groupe de ne pas offrir de renseignements au sujet de la dur\u00e9e possible de la p\u00e9nurie, puisque ce renseignement n'\u00e9tait pas disponible.\n[68] \u00c0 l'audience, la Compagnie a produit des feuilles de calcul Excel qui donnaient des renseignements pertinents au sujet de cinq employ\u00e9s qui, selon l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Compagnie, s'\u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver. L'avocat de la CCDP a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Compagnie de produire les m\u00eames renseignements qu'elle avait produits pour ces cinq employ\u00e9s, pour les quarante deux autres employ\u00e9s qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver. Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s sous la forme de feuilles de calcul Excel et contenaient de nombreuses pages de renseignements au sujet du statut des employ\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode en cause.\n[69] Selon la liste des pi\u00e8ces de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, la Compagnie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les dossiers CATS pour cinq employ\u00e9s. (Voir pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglets 27 \u00e0 31 inclusivement.) Elle a aussi d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux autres dossiers CATS. (Voir les pi\u00e8ces R 10 et R 11.) Les avocats ont interrog\u00e9 et contre interrog\u00e9 Mme Storms avec rigueur sur ces documents. Quant \u00e0 elle, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les dossiers CATS de quinze autres employ\u00e9s. (Voir les pi\u00e8ces HR 1, onglet 5 jusqu'\u00e0 l'onglet 10 et HR 2, onglet 23 jusqu'\u00e0 l'onglet 30.)\n[70] Le reste des dossiers CATS divulgu\u00e9s par la Compagnie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve par l'avocate de la plaignante (voir la pi\u00e8ce C 33). Ces documents n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s en preuve dans le format dans lequel la Compagnie les avait fournis. L'avocate de la plaignante, pendant son contre interrogatoire de Mme Storms, a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 ce qu'elle a d\u00e9crit comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] un document dans un nouveau format en r\u00e9organisant les renseignements contenus dans la feuille de calcul Excel originale produite par la Compagnie. Ce nouveau document a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9organis\u00e9 de telle fa\u00e7on \u00e0 montrer quels employ\u00e9s appel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9taient disponibles \u00e0 diverses dates en 2005.\n[71] Le dernier jour de l'audience, l'avocat de la Compagnie a soulev\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la justesse de certains des renseignements sur les feuilles de calcul. Le 18 janvier 2010, plus de deux mois apr\u00e8s l'audience, la Compagnie a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir la permission de rouvrir le dossier afin de pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles preuves. Cette requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision 2010 TCDP 6.\n[72] La Compagnie a produit les documents et, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 not\u00e9, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de les inclure dans le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Storms. Nous pouvons d\u00e9duire que la Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que Mme Storms connaissait suffisamment les renseignements apparaissant dans ces documents pour pouvoir t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 leur sujet. J'examinerai certains des renseignements contenus dans ces documents en d\u00e9tail, parce qu'ils \u00e9taient importants pour toutes les parties. Afin de prot\u00e9ger la confidentialit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s, ils seront identifi\u00e9s par des lettres qui ne correspondent pas \u00e0 leurs noms r\u00e9els.\n[73] Les documents indiquent que l'employ\u00e9 AB, bien qu'il e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9, ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour combler la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Le 22 mars 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au terminal de Sioux Lookout. Il a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 y travailler jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'avait pas \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. Bien que cet employ\u00e9 e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 le 22 mars, le document indique qu'il a seulement travaill\u00e9 le 24 mars et qu'ensuite, il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 1er avril. Apr\u00e8s cette date, il a travaill\u00e9 le 10 et le 11 avril, mais n'a plus travaill\u00e9 avant le 18 avril. Le 22 juillet, il a pris un cong\u00e9 et n'est retourn\u00e9 au travail que le 12 ao\u00fbt. Il a travaill\u00e9 de cette date jusqu'au 20 ao\u00fbt, mais il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 apr\u00e8s cette date jusqu'au 22 septembre. Il a travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau le 30 septembre, puis n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 28 octobre. Pendant les p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 il ne travaillait pas, l'employ\u00e9 ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour combler la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver.\n[74] L'employ\u00e9 HI travaillait dans une p\u00e9riode de p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne au moment du rappel. Il a travaill\u00e9 dans le cadre de cette p\u00e9nurie jusqu'au 18 mai 2005. Apr\u00e8s cela, il est rentr\u00e9 \u00e0 la maison pendant une semaine, puis s'est rendu \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie le 30 mai. Il a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 19 septembre 2005. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Francis le 29 octobre et y a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[75] Selon les documents produits par la Compagnie, alors qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e0 Vancouver, cet employ\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 par effectuer quatre (4) tours de formation. Apr\u00e8s la fin de sa formation le 3 juin, il a seulement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler le 9 juin. Mme Storms a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait possible que pendant ce temps, il \u00e9tait toujours en formation, bien qu'elle ne puisse pas en \u00eatre certaine. Apr\u00e8s le 9 juin, il est inscrit comme \u00e9tant disponible du 17 juin jusqu'au 26 juin, puis il est inscrit qu'il \u00e9tait en millage. Cela signifie qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 au lieu de la p\u00e9nurie pendant un certain temps et qu'il pouvait retourner \u00e0 la maison pendant quelques jours. Il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver du 16 juin au 6 juillet, ni du 23 juillet au 8 ao\u00fbt. Il a eu un autre cong\u00e9 le 1er septembre. Sa date suivante de travail \u00e9tait le 25 septembre. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le 29 octobre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Fort Francis, mais il n'y a r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 partir du 22 d\u00e9cembre 2005. Lorsque l'avocate de la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi un employ\u00e9 serait affect\u00e9 pendant presque deux mois sans travailler, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Je ne peux pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question.\n[76] L'employ\u00e9 P a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 North Battleford le 25 f\u00e9vrier. Le 19 mars, il a pris une semaine de vacances puis il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 26 mars. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'a plus l'obligation d'aller r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Mme Storms a cependant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le fait d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9 ne signifie pas qu'un employ\u00e9 travaille tous les jours. Dans le cas de l'employ\u00e9 P, par exemple, du 26 mars jusqu'\u00e0 la fin avril, il a seulement travaill\u00e9 sept jours \u00e0 son terminal local, mais Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'il faut \u00eatre prudent en examinant cette information, parce que les tours peuvent durer deux (2) ou trois (3) jours chacun, bien qu'aucune preuve confirmant que c'\u00e9tait le cas pour cet employ\u00e9 n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. L'employ\u00e9 a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied le 24 avril 2005. De cette date jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e, cet employ\u00e9 s'est d\u00e9plac\u00e9 dans la zone de la Saskatchewan [TRADUCTION] occupant des postes ouverts dans d'autres terminaux.\n[77] L'expression [TRADUCTION] occuper des postes ouverts fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la situation o\u00f9 un employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied qui a de l'anciennet\u00e9 dans la r\u00e9gion de l'Ouest choisit de se rendre \u00e0 un autre terminal o\u00f9 un poste qu'il peut occuper est vacant. Lorsqu'un poste devient disponible \u00e0 son terminal local, l'employ\u00e9 y retourne. Si un employ\u00e9 exerce son droit d'anciennet\u00e9 et [TRADUCTION] occupe un poste ouvert, il compte comme un employ\u00e9 qui travaille et il n'a pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie.\n[78] L'employ\u00e9 Y a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Ce jour l\u00e0, il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9, mais selon Mme Storms, le CGE aurait communiqu\u00e9 avec lui dans les jours suivants. Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait examin\u00e9 le dossier de travail de cet employ\u00e9 et qu'il y \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] absent sans permission le 4 mars 2005. Cet employ\u00e9 a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 15 mars 2005. Le 9 avril, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied, puis, le 30 avril, il a obtenu un cong\u00e9 de son coordonnateur des trains. Ce cong\u00e9 a dur\u00e9 jusqu'au 13 mai, o\u00f9 il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied. Le 5 juin, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 jusqu'au 19 juin. Le 20 juin, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon et y a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au 1er juillet, puis il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied de nouveau le 2 juillet. Le 9 juillet, il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon. Le 4 novembre, il a pris cong\u00e9, puis le 13 novembre, il a commenc\u00e9 sa formation de chef de triage. Il a suivi cette formation jusqu'\u00e0 No\u00ebl, puis son nom est rest\u00e9 inscrit au tableau de service jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[79] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] louche et qu'il [TRADUCTION] se rendait indisponible. Elle ajout\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, il n'avait pas eu besoin de se pr\u00e9senter pour la p\u00e9nurie, mais que lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied au d\u00e9but avril, il aurait d\u00fb se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, ce qu'il n'a pas fait. Lorsque l'avocat de la Compagnie lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9 parce qu'il ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, elle a r\u00e9pondu : [TRADUCTION] Je n'en sais rien. Son gestionnaire ... a peut \u00eatre fait quelque chose. Je ne sais pas exactement pourquoi; comme je l'ai dit, je crois qu'il est simplement pass\u00e9 entre les mailles du filet. Comme il travaillait, nous n'avons \u00e9videmment pas effectu\u00e9 de suivi rapproch\u00e9 \u00e0 son sujet. Enfin, le 25 d\u00e9cembre 2005, cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Saskatoon. En contre interrogatoire, Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 que son superviseur croyait qu'il aurait besoin de cet employ\u00e9, alors [TRADUCTION] il ne l'a pas rel\u00e2ch\u00e9 .\n[80] L'employ\u00e9 U a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver au m\u00eame moment que tous les autres. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait personnellement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 et qu'il l'avait avis\u00e9e que son p\u00e8re \u00e9tait en phase terminale. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait pris la d\u00e9cision elle m\u00eame de prolonger le temps qui lui \u00e9tait accord\u00e9 pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Cet employ\u00e9 est rest\u00e9 sur le tableau des mises \u00e0 pied jusqu'au 26 juin 2005, auquel moment il a obtenu un cong\u00e9 du coordonnateur des trains de son terminal. Le 24 juillet, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local. Son p\u00e8re est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en octobre et il a pris un cong\u00e9 de deuil. Apr\u00e8s cela, il est rest\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local pour le restant de l'ann\u00e9e.\n[81] L'employ\u00e9 E \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied lorsque les proc\u00e9dures de rappel ont d\u00e9but\u00e9. Au d\u00e9part, lorsque les employ\u00e9s du CGE ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer avec les employ\u00e9s, ils \u00e9crivaient des notes dans leurs dossiers de travail alors qu'ils effectuaient les appels. Cependant, comme la p\u00e9nurie \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s importante, les proc\u00e9dures devenaient un peu maladroites et Mme Storms a avis\u00e9 ses employ\u00e9s de pr\u00e9parer des tableaux afin de voir comment les choses se d\u00e9roulaient et combien de personnes couvriraient la p\u00e9nurie. Les renseignements qui se trouvent sur ces tableaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis et inscrits par diff\u00e9rents employ\u00e9s du CGE. Le premier tableau a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit le 7 mars 2005. La derni\u00e8re entr\u00e9e datait du 19 mai 2005. Apr\u00e8s cela, la liste n'a plus \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette date, [TRADUCTION] la plupart des 47 employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s avaient r\u00e9pondu ou leur situation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e.\n[82] L'inscription sur les feuilles de calcul pour le 16 mars 2005 indique que l'employ\u00e9 E avait [TRADUCTION] 15 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter, 30 jours demand\u00e9s. G. Spanos, confirmer ou organiser le d\u00e9placement. Le 20 avril 2005, il est inscrit [TRADUCTION] Dans la zone du Manitoba [E] a obtenu un cong\u00e9 de compassion jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre - accord\u00e9 par Ron Smith - pour des raisons personnelles [non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]. Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 que Ron Smith \u00e9tait le gestionnaire du personnel des trains pour la zone du Manitoba. Elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle en savait un peu plus au sujet de la situation de cet employ\u00e9, parce qu'elle avait discut\u00e9 avec son superviseur apr\u00e8s l'audience de l'affaire Seeley. En r\u00e9ponse aux questions que l'avocat de la Compagnie lui a pos\u00e9es, elle a expliqu\u00e9 que la situation de l'employ\u00e9 E \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s semblable \u00e0 celle de l'employ\u00e9 U. Il avait aussi un parent en phase terminale, ce qui expliquait l'inscription du 19 mai 2005, qui pr\u00e9cisait [TRADUCTION] Dans la zone du Manitoba, cette personne a obtenu un [cong\u00e9 de compassion] jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman et K. Carroll. M. Carroll \u00e9tait le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Vancouver, division sud, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, et M. Nashman \u00e9tait le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Centre d'op\u00e9ration de l'Ouest. L'employ\u00e9 E a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 jusqu'au 30 juillet 2005 et a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 absent sans permission du 31 juillet au 8 septembre. Le 10 septembre, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre terminal (Brandon (Manitoba)) et, finalement, il a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 le 19 octobre.\n[83] Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 en contre interrogatoire pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son superviseur avait expliqu\u00e9 que l'employ\u00e9 ne s'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver parce qu'[TRADUCTION] il le formait pour qu'il devienne superviseur, mais l'employ\u00e9 a finalement d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. Cette r\u00e9ponse n'est pas la m\u00eame qu'elle avait donn\u00e9e auparavant \u00e0 l'avocat de la Compagnie, auquel moment elle avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la situation de cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait semblable \u00e0 celle de l'employ\u00e9 U.\n[84] L'employ\u00e9 FG apparaissait dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Compagnie comme ayant d\u00e9missionn\u00e9, mais \u00e0 l'audience, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une erreur. Cet employ\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver et il s'y \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le 22 mars 2005. Cependant, de cette date jusqu'au 21 septembre 2005, l'employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait en [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 de maladie. Il a obtenu ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme un [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur les cong\u00e9s familiaux. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer ce qu'\u00e9tait la [TRADUCTION] Loi sur les cong\u00e9s familiaux , Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne savait pas. Une recherche rapide n'a pas permis au Tribunal de trouver une loi portant le nom de [TRADUCTION] Loi sur les cong\u00e9s familiaux. Cet employ\u00e9 a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 de son poste \u00e0 la Compagnie le 6 mai 2006.\n[85] L'employ\u00e9 O appara\u00eet dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la Compagnie comme s'il s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver et qu'il \u00e9tait toujours employ\u00e9 de la Compagnie. Cependant, les documents produits \u00e0 l'audience d\u00e9montrent que cet employ\u00e9 ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver. Il est rest\u00e9 dans sa province o\u00f9, selon Mme Storms, [TRADUCTION] tous les employ\u00e9s de l'endroit \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s.\n[86] L'employ\u00e9 QR couvrait une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne lorsque la proc\u00e9dure de rappel a d\u00e9but\u00e9, donc il n'avait pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter imm\u00e9diatement \u00e0 Vancouver. Lorsqu'il a eu termin\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Hornepayne, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais pendant la p\u00e9riode du 8 novembre 2005 au 20 d\u00e9cembre 2005, il a travaill\u00e9 seulement trois jours. Avant le 8 novembre, il semble qu'il a travaill\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pas commenter la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant le 8 novembre, mais elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il y avait toujours une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[87] Un autre employ\u00e9, l'employ\u00e9 M, s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 25 mars 2005, mais de cette date jusqu'\u00e0 la fin 2005, les documents indiquent qu'il n'a travaill\u00e9 que trente quatre (34) tours. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, entre le 17 septembre et le 31 d\u00e9cembre, il n'a travaill\u00e9 que dix (10) tours. Les documents montrent que cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent tr\u00e8s souvent. Les documents indiquent aussi qu'entre le 30 novembre et le 31 d\u00e9cembre 2005, cet employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait absent sans permission. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne connaissait pas la raison de cette absence. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que seul son superviseur pouvait donner une justification. Cet employ\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9.\n[88] L'employ\u00e9 A a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pendant environ deux (2) mois. Le 14 mai 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Kenora. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur qui avait pris la d\u00e9cision de l'affecter \u00e0 Kenora [TRADUCTION] croyait ou pr\u00e9voyait qu'il y aurait du travail \u00e0 ce terminal pour cet employ\u00e9. Cependant, les documents indiquent que du 17 mai 2005 au 4 ao\u00fbt 2005, cet employ\u00e9 a travaill\u00e9 trois (3) tours \u00e0 Kenora et que du 1er novembre jusqu'\u00e0 la fin d\u00e9cembre, il n'a travaill\u00e9 que sept (7) tours. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait pr\u00e9senter de raison pour laquelle le superviseur \u00e0 Kenora avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'affecter cet employ\u00e9, mais elle a reconnu que cette [TRADUCTION] personne n'avait pas beaucoup travaill\u00e9 .\n[89] L'employ\u00e9 C s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 15 mars 2005. Il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais son nom apparaissait comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] disponible sur le tableau \u00e0 de nombreuses occasions. Le 16 mai 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Kenora. Du 17 mai au 9 juillet 2005, il a travaill\u00e9 trois (3) jours \u00e0 ce terminal et du 20 octobre au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2005, les documents indiquent qu'il n'a pas du tout travaill\u00e9. Mme Storms a confirm\u00e9 cette information dans son t\u00e9moignage.\n[90] L'employ\u00e9 DE a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 15 mars 2005. Son horaire de travail \u00e0 Vancouver a \u00e9t\u00e9 plut\u00f4t r\u00e9gulier. Le 18 juin 2005, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 et affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Terrace, mais alors qu'il s'y trouvait, il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 avant le 23 septembre, date \u00e0 laquelle il a de nouveau \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[91] Un autre employ\u00e9, IJ, a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, mais il n'a pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver parce qu'il couvrait une p\u00e9nurie dans un autre endroit. Du 17 mars au 16 mai, alors qu'il couvrait cette p\u00e9nurie, les documents montrent qu'il n'a travaill\u00e9 qu'une (1) seule journ\u00e9e (le 26 avril 2005). Du 20 mai au 27 mai, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local \u00e0 Thunder Bay. Du 3 juin au 24 juin, il s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, mais une fois de plus, les documents montrent qu'il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 pendant plusieurs jours. Du 16 juillet au 1er septembre, il a eu un horaire de travail plut\u00f4t r\u00e9gulier. Le 7 septembre, il a quitt\u00e9 Vancouver pour se rendre \u00e0 Sioux Lookout, o\u00f9 il n'a travaill\u00e9 que quatre (4) jours jusqu'au 27 octobre 2005. Apr\u00e8s cette date, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 d'abord \u00e0 Brandon, puis \u00e0 Fort Francis.\n[92] L'employ\u00e9 O ne s'est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver pour diverses raisons inexpliqu\u00e9es. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local, mais les documents d\u00e9montrent que pendant la p\u00e9riode allant jusqu'en d\u00e9cembre, son horaire de travail \u00e0 ce terminal \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s irr\u00e9gulier. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ces renseignements [TRADUCTION] semblaient justes et elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'[TRADUCTION] il revenait au terminal de mettre \u00e0 pied cet employ\u00e9. Si le terminal l'a affect\u00e9 et qu'il n'a pas travaill\u00e9, il n'y a pas grand chose que le CGE pouvait faire.\n[93] L'employ\u00e9 W s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver le 14 avril 2005. De cette date jusqu'au 29 juillet, il a travaill\u00e9 dix huit (18) jours. Le 29 juillet 2005 a \u00e9t\u00e9 sa derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e \u00e0 Vancouver. Le 30 juillet, cet employ\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local. Il y a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9, mais n'a pas travaill\u00e9 du 13 ao\u00fbt au 19 septembre. Il a travaill\u00e9 le 20 septembre, mais n'a pas travaill\u00e9 par la suite avant le 12 novembre, date \u00e0 laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre terminal pendant sept (7) jours. Il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 son terminal local le 19 novembre, o\u00f9 il n'a pas travaill\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne savait pas pourquoi cet employ\u00e9 n'avait pas travaill\u00e9.\n[94] Dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9es de la Compagnie, il est indiqu\u00e9 que l'employ\u00e9 BC a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9. Cependant, selon les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience, cet employ\u00e9 obtenait [TRADUCTION] des prestations d'assurance de longue dur\u00e9e - de la Great West, compagnie d'assurance-vie. Selon Mme Storms, le r\u00e9partiteur au CGE avait probablement parl\u00e9 au superviseur de cet employ\u00e9. L'employ\u00e9 n'a pas eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[95] \u00c0 partir de cette preuve, le Tribunal conclut que beaucoup des employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver ne s'y sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s ou, s'ils s'y sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 inscrits comme \u00e9tant [TRADUCTION] disponibles pour travailler pendant divers jours, mais n'ont pas travaill\u00e9.\n(v) Le rappel au travail de la plaignante [96] Avant de traiter les faits concernant le rappel de la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver, le Tribunal note que pendant son contre interrogatoire, Mme Storms a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas personnellement gard\u00e9 de dossier pr\u00e9cis pour la situation de la plaignante. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que Joe Lyon, le gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations de la Compagnie au CGE pour les op\u00e9rations de l'Ouest, et aussi le gestionnaire du Groupe de rajustement des tableaux, qui se rapportait directement \u00e0 Mme Storms, auraient probablement conserv\u00e9 des documents dans le [TRADUCTION] dossier sur la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver et que les lettres de la plaignante auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 rang\u00e9es dans son dossier personnel \u00e0 la Compagnie. M. Lyon n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, alors il a \u00e9t\u00e9 impossible pour le Tribunal de v\u00e9rifier cette information.\n[97] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le 17 mars 2005, elle a re\u00e7u une lettre de la Compagnie dat\u00e9e du 28 f\u00e9vrier 2005. Cette lettre l'avisait qu'elle \u00e9tait rappel\u00e9e au tableau de service et qu'elle devait r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s de triage \u00e0 Vancouver. La lettre l'avisait aussi que si elle \u00e9tait incapable de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver dans les quinze (15) jours apr\u00e8s son rappel, elle devait communiquer avec le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Vancouver. Lorsqu'elle a re\u00e7u cette lettre, la plaignante a communiqu\u00e9 avec M. Spanos, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Vancouver, et a tent\u00e9 de lui expliquer sa situation et \u00e0 quel point sa famille \u00e9tait an\u00e9antie par la nouvelle, mais elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne semblait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9; il souhaitait seulement savoir \u00e0 quel moment elle arriverait \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[98] Le 18 mars 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Compagnie pour l'aviser qu'elle avait re\u00e7u la lettre du 28 f\u00e9vrier le 17 mars 2005. Elle a demand\u00e9 un avis de trente (30) jours conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 115 de la convention collective. Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait m\u00e8re seule de deux enfants d'\u00e2ge scolaire et que la nouvelle de son transfert forc\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver avait [TRADUCTION] caus\u00e9 beaucoup d'anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 pour tous. Sa lettre \u00e9tait adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Compagnie et une copie avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e au local du Syndicat \u00e0 Jasper ainsi qu'\u00e0 Joe Lyon, Colin Pizziol, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper, et \u00e0 George Spanos.\n[99] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas avoir vu cette lettre. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait au courant \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que la plaignante avait des probl\u00e8mes au niveau de la garde de ses enfants et que c'\u00e9tait pourquoi elle avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Joe Torchia, le directeur des relations de travail de la Compagnie, au sujet des personnes qui ne pouvaient pas se pr\u00e9senter, et que la plaignante faisait partie de ce groupe. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 normal de demander \u00e0 la plaignante de soulever la question avec son superviseur, mais qu'elle ne pouvait pas se souvenir si cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[100] Quant \u00e0 lui, M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait eu connaissance de cette lettre. Il croit avoir re\u00e7u une copie de la lettre ou avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de son contenu par le CGE. Selon son interpr\u00e9tation de la lettre, la plaignante demandait seulement \u00e0 obtenir plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Il a alors avis\u00e9 Mme Storms d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une prorogation du temps pr\u00e9vu pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[101] La compagnie n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de la plaignante et aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Compagnie au sujet du fait que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e qu'elle avait obtenu une prorogation du temps pr\u00e9vu pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[102] M. Torchia a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que vers la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode, il avait re\u00e7u un appel de Bryan Boechler, le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Syndicat, au sujet de la plaignante, de Kasha Whyte et de Denise Seeley. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Boechler lui avait expliqu\u00e9 que ces employ\u00e9es avaient des probl\u00e8mes de [TRADUCTION] garde d'enfants et qu'il avait demand\u00e9 qu'on leur accorde plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il croyait qu'\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, une prorogation avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e.\n[103] Les feuilles de calcul pr\u00e9par\u00e9es par le CGE au sujet du rappel n'appuient pas le t\u00e9moignage de M. Torchia. Sur la feuille dat\u00e9e du [TRADUCTION] 18 mars 2005 \u00e0 13 h, une note dans la colonne de la plaignante pr\u00e9cise : [TRADUCTION] Message laiss\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence pour qu'elle effectue son examen m\u00e9dical - demande 15 jours. La note inscrite dans la colonne de K. Whyte pr\u00e9cisait : [TRADUCTION] 15 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter. Trente jours demand\u00e9s - OK le 29 mars, accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman, et dans la colonne de D. Seeley, la note indiquait : [TRADUCTION] 16 jours pour se pr\u00e9senter, 30 jours demand\u00e9s - OK en date du 6 avril, accord\u00e9 par A. Nashman.\n[104] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 25 avril 2005, M. Lyon a avis\u00e9 la plaignante d'avertir la Compagnie, au plus tard le 6 mai 2005, si elle se pr\u00e9senterait au travail \u00e0 Vancouver. Dans cette lettre, on avisait aussi la plaignante que si elle ne se pr\u00e9sentait pas \u00e0 Vancouver, elle renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9 et la compagnie allait [TRADUCTION] se passer de ses services. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de cette [TRADUCTION] lettre type provenant de son bureau. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle savait \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque que la plaignante avait des [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8mes en mati\u00e8re de garde d'enfants et que [TRADUCTION] selon ce qu'elle avait compris, la plaignante n'allait pas se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[105] Le 1er mai 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia pour lui demander un cong\u00e9 de compassion pour \u00e9viter d'avoir \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver. Dans sa lettre, elle a expliqu\u00e9 entre autres :\n[TRADUCTION]\nJe vous demande de bien vouloir tenir compte de ce qui suit, au sujet du r\u00e9cent avis me demandant de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver, car la pr\u00e9sente est une demande de compassion... Je suis une m\u00e8re seule de deux enfants d'\u00e2ge scolaire. Ma fille est en 6e ann\u00e9e et va vivre une \u00e9tape importante dans sa vie alors qu'elle terminera l'\u00e9cole primaire, o\u00f9 elle a fait toutes ses \u00e9tudes, avec les amis avec qui elle a grandi... Mon fils est en 5e ann\u00e9e et vit pr\u00e9sentement sa meilleure ann\u00e9e d'\u00e9tudes \u00e0 vie, il s'est grandement am\u00e9lior\u00e9, et lui aussi a beaucoup d'attaches... Je vous prie de noter qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une question de trouver une garde appropri\u00e9e pour mes enfants. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'ordonnance de la Cour du Banc de la Reine de l'Alberta, je suis responsable de la r\u00e9sidence principale des deux enfants susmentionn\u00e9s et leur p\u00e8re, qui habite \u00e0 Jasper, et moi partageons la garde l\u00e9gale. Cette ordonnance comprend des dispositions au sujet de la question d'\u00e9loigner mes enfants de leur p\u00e8re, en particulier de les sortir de la province, y compris l'obligation de pr\u00e9senter un avis \u00e9crit de 90 jours afin qu'un juge puisse trancher la question. Leur p\u00e8re joue un r\u00f4le actif dans leur vie et ne me laissera pas \u00e9loigner ses enfants de lui, en particulier alors qu'il existe une ordonnance de la cour prot\u00e9geant ses droits. Selon un avis juridique, il serait fortement improbable qu'un juge d\u00e9cide de retirer les enfants de leur milieu, vu l'instabilit\u00e9 de la situation... Compte tenu de la situation, avant de prendre votre d\u00e9cision, je vous demande de faire preuve de compassion envers mes enfants ainsi qu'envers deux de vos employ\u00e9s la plaignante et son mari ...compte tenu des motifs pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, je demande que la Compagnie m'accorde un cong\u00e9 de compassion me permettant de ne pas me pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, en raison des exigences juridiques qui m'obligent \u00e0 rester \u00e0 Jasper.\n[106] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsqu'il a re\u00e7u cette lettre, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec le CGE et a donn\u00e9 l'instruction d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une prorogation de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9vue. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, il savait que trois (3) employ\u00e9es du terminal de Jasper demandaient des [TRADUCTION] mesures d'accommodement pour [TRADUCTION] des raisons tr\u00e8s semblables. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u une autre lettre avant celle ci, de la part de Kasha Whyte, et que c'est de cette fa\u00e7on qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de la situation. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il en \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la conclusion, sans jamais avoir discut\u00e9 avec les employ\u00e9es en question, qu'elles avaient besoin simplement de plus de temps pour s'organiser.\n[107] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Torchia au sujet du fait qu'il a discut\u00e9 avec Mme Storms correspond aux renseignements inscrits sur les feuilles de calcul du CGE. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 deux autres femmes une prorogation de 30 jours. Les notes sur les feuilles de calcul du [TRADUCTION] 2 mai 2005 \u00e0 17 h, du [TRADUCTION] 19 mai 2005 \u00e0 10 h 30 et du [TRADUCTION] 19 mai 2005 \u00e0 17 h sont les m\u00eames pour les trois femmes : [TRADUCTION] Garde d'enfants - temporairement en attente conform\u00e9ment aux consignes de Joe Torchia.\n[108] Selon M. Torchia, il est inhabituel que ce genre de questions lui soient envoy\u00e9es directement. Il a ajout\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s qui avaient de telles demandes les pr\u00e9sentaient normalement \u00e0 leur superviseur. Le superviseur traite ces demandes directement et elles sont rarement transf\u00e9r\u00e9es [TRADUCTION] \u00e0 son niveau. Cependant, en contre interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que m\u00eame si la plaignante avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande \u00e0 son superviseur, le r\u00e9sultat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame, parce que le superviseur aurait d\u00fb obtenir l'approbation de M. Morris ou de lui m\u00eame.\n[109] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvient pas avoir lu la lettre du 1er mai, bien qu'une copie ait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Lyon. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle en avait peut \u00eatre discut\u00e9 avec M. Torchia, mais qu'elle ne pouvait se souvenir de la conversation pr\u00e9cise. Elle a aussi expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle ne savait pas que la plaignante avait soulev\u00e9 la question d'une ordonnance relative \u00e0 la garde.\n[110] Comme M. Torchia n'a pas recommuniqu\u00e9 avec elle et comme le CGE l'avait appel\u00e9e \u00e0 prendre un tour d'urgence, la plaignante a suppos\u00e9 que sa suggestion de rester \u00e0 Jasper et de travailler sur le tableau des urgences avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, la plaignante s'\u00e9tait inscrite pour effectuer du travail d'urgence en juin 2005 et elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 faire neuf (9) tours pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[111] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que pendant la derni\u00e8re semaine de mai ou au d\u00e9but de juin 2005, il participait \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec Albert Nashman, le gestionnaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Compagnie pour le Centre d'exploitation de l'Ouest et Bryan Boechler, le pr\u00e9sident g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Syndicat. Bien que la r\u00e9union ait port\u00e9 sur d'autres questions, \u00e0 un certain moment, M. Boechler a demand\u00e9 une autre prorogation pour la plaignante et les deux autres employ\u00e9es. Selon M. Torchia, M. Nashman et lui m\u00eame ont accord\u00e9 une autre prorogation jusqu'au 2 juillet 2005. Selon ce que M. Torchia avait compris, il \u00e9tait clair qu'il s'agissait de la derni\u00e8re prorogation qui serait accord\u00e9e. En contre interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas si cette d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante. Il a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait [TRADUCTION] pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante en lui accordant plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que la possibilit\u00e9 d'accorder un [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 de compassion ne lui avait jamais travers\u00e9 l'esprit. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu'un [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9 \u00e9tait normalement accord\u00e9 pour des raisons [TRADUCTION] opportunes quant aux exigences op\u00e9rationnelles de la Compagnie. Cependant, il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne savait pas que certains employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver avaient obtenu des cong\u00e9s accord\u00e9s par leurs superviseurs.\n[112] M. Torchia a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 en contre interrogatoire qu'il [TRADUCTION] \u00e9tait injuste de conclure qu'il n'avait pas appliqu\u00e9 la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie dans ce cas. Il a ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante avait des [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 sa situation de famille et qu'il avait pris [TRADUCTION] des mesures d'accommodement pour ces pr\u00e9occupations en prolongeant le temps pr\u00e9vu pour qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 que la plaignante avait obtenu plus de temps pour s'organiser, mais qu'elle ne l'avait pas fait et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[113] Le 27 juin 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e dans une lettre de L. Gallegos, gestionnaire des op\u00e9rations au CGE, qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver au plus tard le 2 juillet 2005. Elle a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e que si elle ne s'y pr\u00e9sentait pas, elle renon\u00e7ait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9 et son poste au sein de la Compagnie serait aboli. Cette lettre mentionnait aussi une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 22 juin 2005 entre la plaignante et Elaine Storms. Pendant cette conversation, Mme Storms avait aussi avis\u00e9 la plaignante qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver au plus tard le 2 juillet 2005, sinon elle perdrait son emploi.\n[114] La plaignante se souvenait de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait avis\u00e9 Mme Storms qu'il devait y avoir une erreur et elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parler \u00e0 Joe Torchia au sujet de sa situation. La plaignante croyait que sa situation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e parce que la Compagnie lui permettait de travailler en fonction du tableau d'urgence \u00e0 Jasper. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle croyait qu'il s'agissait l\u00e0 de la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande de cong\u00e9 de compassion. Apr\u00e8s la lettre du 27 juin 2005, on a cess\u00e9 de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de travailler en fonction du tableau d'urgence.\n[115] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle savait, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, que la plaignante avait des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de ses enfants. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle ne connaissait pas les d\u00e9tails de la situation. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle se souvenait de certaines parties de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 22 juin 2005. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plaignante lui avait dit qu'elle ne pouvait pas se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver en raison de [TRADUCTION] questions de garde d'enfants. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvenait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment si la plaignante avait demand\u00e9 une prorogation du temps allou\u00e9, mais que si cela avait \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas, elle l'aurait renvoy\u00e9e \u00e0 son superviseur et au Syndicat. Mme Storms a aussi expliqu\u00e9 que si la plaignante lui avait dit qu'elle avait une entente avec M. Torchia, elle aurait appel\u00e9 ce dernier et, s'il lui avait dit qu'il allouait \u00e0 la plaignante plus de temps, elle lui aurait accord\u00e9 plus de temps. Cependant, elle a ajout\u00e9 que lors de sa conversation avec M. Torchia, il avait clairement mentionn\u00e9 que les stipulations de la convention collective devaient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9es dans ce dossier.\n[116] En contre interrogatoire, Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait un certain nombre d'employ\u00e9s qui vivaient des [TRADUCTION] situations en raison d'enfants \u00e0 la maison, mais qu'elle ne pouvait pas se souvenir du nombre exact, sauf pour la plaignante, Kasha Whyte et Denise Seeley. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'il [TRADUCTION] s'agissait d'un th\u00e8me plut\u00f4t g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, parce que beaucoup de personnes ont des enfants. Pendant son contre interrogatoire, M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'aucun autre cas fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille, sauf pour les trois cas mentionn\u00e9s, n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention. Aucune autre inscription dans les feuilles de calcul du CGE, sauf pour les inscriptions de la plaignante, de Denise Seeley et de Kasha Whyte, ne mentionnait de [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8mes familiaux ou de [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8mes en mati\u00e8re de garde des enfants pour expliquer le d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter pour la p\u00e9nurie. M. Torchia a aussi ajout\u00e9 que pendant ses conversations avec Mme Storms, il n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 d'autres situations o\u00f9 des employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9s de l'obligation de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[117] Le 22 ou le 23 juin 2005, dans un courriel de r\u00e9ponse au courriel de Mme Storms r\u00e9capitulant la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec la plaignante, M. Torchia a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] \u00c0 mon avis elles [la plaignante, Kasha Whyte et Denise Seeley] ont obtenu suffisamment de temps pour organiser leurs affaires personnelles. Si elles souhaitent obtenir plus de temps, elles devront s'organiser avec leur superviseur. Brian Kalin, qui \u00e9tait le superviseur de M. Pizziol, a \u00e9crit le m\u00eame jour : [TRADUCTION] Il n'y aura pas d'autre prorogation. Je suis d'accord avec Joe - elles ont eu plusieurs mois pour s'organiser. Il est temps qu'elles prennent une d\u00e9cision. Brian Kalin n'ayant pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, le Tribunal n'a donc aucun d\u00e9tail au sujet de ce qu'il connaissait de la situation de la plaignante. De plus, rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que quelqu'un \u00e0 la Compagnie a avis\u00e9 la plaignante qu'elle devait traiter avec son superviseur imm\u00e9diat, M. Pizziol, au sujet de sa demande d'exemption quant \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie de Vancouver.\n[118] Il convient aussi de mentionner que dans l'ensemble des courriels que la Compagnie a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience se trouve un courriel qui, selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Torchia, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit par Albert Nashman. M. Torchia a ajout\u00e9 que le courriel avait possiblement \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9 d'un autre courriel, mais il n'en \u00e9tait pas s\u00fbr. Il ne pouvait pas non plus pr\u00e9ciser la date de ce courriel. Le courriel se lisait comme suit : [TRADUCTION] J'ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 Boechler hier soir. Je lui ai dit qu'on ne continuerait pas \u00e0 retarder le processus. Elles ont l'obligation, en fonction de la convention collective, de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. Je lui ai demand\u00e9 ce qu'on devait r\u00e9pondre au prochain groupe qui dirait qu'il ne veut pas aller \u00e0 Vancouver. S'il veut d\u00e9poser un grief, qu'il le fasse. Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.\n[119] Le contenu de ce courriel ne semble pas correspondre au t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de M. Torchia au sujet du fait qu'il avait pris la d\u00e9cision qu'aucune autre prorogation ne serait accord\u00e9e pendant la r\u00e9union avec M. Nashman et M. Boechler \u00e0 la fin mai ou dans la premi\u00e8re semaine de juin. Pourtant, ce courriel semble laisser entendre que c'est M. Nashman qui a pris la d\u00e9cision. M. Nashman n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[120] Le 2 juillet 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Peter Marshall, le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral adjoint de la Compagnie pour l'Ouest du Canada. Elle a de nouveau demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la Compagnie tienne compte de sa situation et lui accorde un cong\u00e9 de compassion. Elle a annex\u00e9 \u00e0 cette lettre une copie de sa correspondance avec M. Torchia. Elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse de M. Marshall ou de quelqu'un \u00e0 son bureau.\n[121] Le 4 juillet 2005, la Compagnie a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la plaignante :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa pr\u00e9sente lettre confirme, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la clause 115 et \u00e0 la clause 148 de la convention collective 4.3, que vous avez renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 vos droits d'anciennet\u00e9 et que vos services ne sont plus requis par la compagnie. Votre dossier d'emploi est maintenant ferm\u00e9.\n[122] Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvient pas si elle avait discut\u00e9 avec le superviseur de la plaignante avant de cong\u00e9dier la plaignante, mais elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, l'employeur ne prend pas \u00e0 une telle d\u00e9cision sans d'abord discuter avec le superviseur. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que si elle ne l'avait pas fait personnellement, M. Lyon aurait probablement discut\u00e9 avec le superviseur. Ni M. Pizziol, le superviseur de la plaignante, ni M. Lyon n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner.\n[123] Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait suivi les directives de M. Torchia et de M. Albert Nashman en ce qui a trait au cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante.\n[124] Apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, la plaignante a continu\u00e9 d'esp\u00e9rer que la Compagnie la r\u00e9int\u00e9grerait dans ses fonctions. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'au d\u00e9but 2006, elle avait remarqu\u00e9 que le triage \u00e0 Jasper manquait de plus en plus d'employ\u00e9s. Elle avait donc d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'\u00e9crire \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 M. Marshall le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2006 pour l'aviser qu'elle \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] pr\u00eate, d\u00e9sireuse et capable de retourner travailler \u00e0 Jasper pour aider \u00e0 soulager cette p\u00e9nurie et qu'elle le ferait avec plaisir.\n[125] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2006, M. Marshall a r\u00e9pondu :\n[TRADUCTION]\nAyant re\u00e7u votre lettre, j'ai examin\u00e9 votre dossier et j'ai remarqu\u00e9 que vous avez \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux stipulations de la convention collective en raison de votre d\u00e9faut de vous conformer aux conditions de cette convention collective. J'appr\u00e9cie le fait que vous \u00eates maintenant pr\u00eate, d\u00e9sireuse et capable de travailler et nous serions pr\u00eats \u00e0 examiner la possibilit\u00e9 de vous r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans vos fonctions si vous acceptez de vous conformer aux conditions de la convention collective. Cependant, je ne peux pas garantir que vous travailleriez exclusivement \u00e0 Jasper. Votre lieu de travail serait d\u00e9termin\u00e9 en fonction de votre anciennet\u00e9 et de nos exigences en mati\u00e8re d'effectif. De plus, je crois comprendre qu'il y a actuellement un grief au sujet de votre cong\u00e9diement en cours et votre retour au travail serait conditionnel au retrait de ce grief.\n[126] Apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, la plaignante a demand\u00e9 au Syndicat de renvoyer son grief en arbitrage. Le 12 avril 2006, l'arbitre Picher a rendu sa d\u00e9cision arbitrale, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e au Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer canadiens (le Bureau), dossier no 3550. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, l'arbitre d\u00e9clare, entre autres :\n[TRADUCTION]\nPour les motifs expliqu\u00e9s plus en d\u00e9tail dans le CROA & DR 3549, l'arbitre ne peut pas donner raison au Syndicat. Rien dans la convention collective ne laisse entendre que la Compagnie doit soigneusement soupeser les obligations personnelles et familiales d'un employ\u00e9 et que ces obligations doivent \u00e9clipser les droits et les obligations de base d\u00e9coulant de l'anciennet\u00e9 et de l'ordre de rappel des employ\u00e9s dans une unit\u00e9 de n\u00e9gociation, tels qu'ils sont stipul\u00e9s dans la convention collective. Il n'y a aucun fondement raisonnable pour lequel un conseil d'arbitrage peut conclure que la situation personnelle d'un individu explique non seulement son d\u00e9faut de se pr\u00e9senter au travail lors d'un rappel, mais l'exempte ind\u00e9finiment, peut \u00eatre pour des ann\u00e9es, des m\u00eames obligations de travail qui s'appliquent aux autres employ\u00e9s, y compris les autres employ\u00e9s monoparentaux ou employ\u00e9s mari\u00e9s qui ont des obligations familiales comparables. En effet, ce que la plaignante demande \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 une modification de la convention collective par l'arbitre et \u00e0 la cr\u00e9ation d'une forme de super anciennet\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur la situation personnelle. Pour les motifs pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, rien dans la convention collective n'ouvre la porte \u00e0 un tel r\u00e9sultat. Au contraire, l'arbitre est tenu d'appliquer les stipulations portant sur l'anciennet\u00e9 et sur le rappel dans la convention collective, telles qu'elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par les parties. De plus, il convient de noter que le Syndicat ne demande pas, dans le pr\u00e9sent grief, une r\u00e9paration pour une quelconque contravention \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nNon soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.\n[127] La d\u00e9cision CROA no 3549 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision d'arbitrage dans l'affaire Kasha Whyte. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, l'arbitre a expliqu\u00e9, entre autres :\n[TRADUCTION]\nDans le pr\u00e9sent grief, le Syndicat ne soutient pas qu'il y avait une obligation d'accommodement envers la plaignante au sens des dispositions de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ou de toute autre loi. Il soutient plut\u00f4t que la Compagnie a d\u00e9raisonnablement omis d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante un cong\u00e9 pour lui permettre d'\u00e9viter le rappel \u00e0 Vancouver en raison de sa situation personnelle.\n[...]\nApr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 un examen attentif des faits, l'arbitre a beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter l'all\u00e9gation du Syndicat. Premi\u00e8rement, je suis d'accord avec la Compagnie au sujet du fait que la plaignante n'a pas demand\u00e9 de cong\u00e9. Ce qu'elle demandait \u00e9tait une forme de super anciennet\u00e9 qui lui permettrait, contrairement aux autres employ\u00e9s, de rester en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 Jasper, sans \u00eatre oblig\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries ailleurs, tout en continuant de recevoir des appels p\u00e9riodiques pour travailler en fonction de la liste d'urgence \u00e0 Jasper, comme elle l'a fait auparavant. Un cong\u00e9 sous entend le d\u00e9part du lieu de travail, virtuellement pour n'importe quelle raison, que ce soit pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie ou pour une p\u00e9riode fixe. Ce ne sont pas les options que Mme Whyte a demand\u00e9es... La plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce ne demandait pas un rajustement ou un accommodement de son horaire de travail. Elle demandait plut\u00f4t une exemption de l'une des obligations les plus fondamentales de la convention collective, c'est \u00e0 dire l'obligation de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie dans son territoire d'anciennet\u00e9 lorsqu'il manque d'employ\u00e9s dans un lieu.\n[...]\nJ'aurais de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que la Compagnie a d\u00e9raisonnablement ou arbitrairement refus\u00e9 d'accorder \u00e0 la plaignante une modification aux obligations stipul\u00e9es dans sa convention collective, modification qui pourrait durer ind\u00e9finiment, peut \u00eatre jusqu'\u00e0 dix ans, alors qu'elle continuerait \u00e0 jouir d'un statut sp\u00e9cial prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'employ\u00e9e qui ne peut \u00eatre forc\u00e9e de travailler qu'\u00e0 Jasper.\n[...]\nLe pr\u00e9sent grief fait ressortir ce qui doit \u00eatre reconnu comme une constante dans toute relation d'emploi, c'est \u00e0 dire la tension entre les obligations personnelles et familiales et les obligations envers l'employeur. De nombreuses circonstances peuvent avoir un effet sur les obligations personnelles ou familiales d'un employ\u00e9 : le soin d'un enfant, le soin d'un parent \u00e2g\u00e9 ou de tout autre parent proche, ou le soin d'un conjoint atteint d'une d\u00e9ficience m\u00e9dicale importante. D'autres situations personnelles peuvent comprendre des obligations de libert\u00e9 conditionnelle ou de service communautaire apr\u00e8s l'imposition d'une peine, la participation active \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise ou \u00e0 un groupe social, le b\u00e9n\u00e9volat ou les activit\u00e9s sportives comp\u00e9titives, pour n'en nommer que quelques unes.\nUne compagnie de chemins de fer est, de nature, une entreprise qui fonctionne vingt quatre heures par jour, sept jours par semaine. Les personnes embauch\u00e9es pour travailler, en particulier le personnel des trains, savent ou devraient raisonnablement savoir que leurs heures de travail seront irr\u00e9guli\u00e8res et qu'\u00e0 l'occasion, elles auront l'obligation de changer de lieu pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie au besoin. En \u00e9change pour leur acceptation de ces lourdes obligations, les employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie de chemins de fer ont obtenu l'avantage de salaires relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et de bons avantages sociaux.\nPour quelle raison un conseil d'arbitrage, responsable de l'interpr\u00e9tation et de l'application des clauses de la convention collective, pourrait il conclure que la situation d'un parent seul peut r\u00e9ellement \u00e9clipser les obligations d'emploi n\u00e9goci\u00e9es par les parties dans les clauses de la convention collective? Dans un monde o\u00f9 le fait d'\u00eatre parent seul est commun, cela n'est pas une question n\u00e9gligeable. De mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les conseils d'arbitrage, dont le pr\u00e9sent Bureau, ont confirm\u00e9 qu'en ce qui a trait aux questions de garde d'enfants, le fardeau revient \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9, et non \u00e0 l'employeur, de garantir que les obligations familiales n'interf\u00e8rent pas avec les obligations de base d'un contrat d'emploi.\nBien entendu, il revient aux parties de n\u00e9gocier le libell\u00e9 de leur convention collective afin de pr\u00e9voir une exemption possible des obligations d'emploi qui s'appliqueraient autrement aux parents uniques, ou m\u00eame aux parents mari\u00e9s qui ont des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux. Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les l\u00e9gislateurs, tant f\u00e9d\u00e9ral que provinciaux, pourraient promulguer des lois claires qui obligent les employeurs \u00e0 tenir compte de tels facteurs dans l'administration des contrats d'emploi et des conventions collectives. Cependant, compte tenu de l'\u00e9tat des choses, l'arbitre ne peut relever aucune pratique discriminatoire dans la politique de la Compagnie. La politique exige pour l'essentiel que tous les parents, qu'ils soient c\u00e9libataires ou mari\u00e9s, r\u00e9pondent \u00e0 leurs obligations de base d'emploi peu importe leur situation personnelle ou familiale. Bien entendu, il arrive, comme c'est le cas pour la plaignante, que des prorogations de d\u00e9lai et d'autres accommodements soient accord\u00e9s lorsque l'employ\u00e9 d\u00e9montre que sa situation personnelle est difficile. Toutefois, en bout de ligne, tous les employ\u00e9s qui ont des obligations parentales sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on, sans discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. \u00c0 mon avis, il serait tout \u00e0 fait inappropri\u00e9, alors que ni les parties, ni les l\u00e9gislateurs n'ont adopt\u00e9 de telle protection, qu'un arbitre extrapole, \u00e0 partir d'une stipulation telle que la clause 115.4 et de l'expression raisons satisfaisantes de ne pas r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un rappel, une annulation r\u00e9elle de l'obligation la plus fondamentale d'un employ\u00e9 envers sa convention collective d'\u00eatre au travail, d'une fa\u00e7on qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 accorder une forme de super anciennet\u00e9. Si ni les parties elles m\u00eames, ni les l\u00e9gislateurs n'ont labour\u00e9 un tel nouveau sillon, il ne revient \u00e9videmment pas \u00e0 l'arbitre de le faire, puisqu'il est tenu, comme tout conseil d'arbitrage, d'appliquer la convention collective comme elle est \u00e9crite. Il revient aux parties de n\u00e9gocier ce qui deviendrait un cong\u00e9 parental ind\u00e9fini ou partiel, ou aux l\u00e9gislateurs comp\u00e9tents de le faire, si cela est appropri\u00e9 ou d\u00e9sirable.\nNon soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.\n[128] \u00c0 la lecture de la d\u00e9cision de l'arbitre Picher, le Tribunal ne peut que r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ce qu'il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, 2010 TCDP 20, au sujet de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[227] Dans Whyte, l'employ\u00e9 avait enti\u00e8rement le fardeau de s'adapter \u00e0 tout besoin associ\u00e9 avec le fait de travailler pour une compagnie qui fonctionne 24 heures par jour, 7 jours par semaine, telle qu'une compagnie de chemins de fer. La d\u00e9cision concluait que [TRADUCTION] en \u00e9change pour leur acceptation de ces lourdes obligations, les employ\u00e9s de la compagnie de chemins de fer ont obtenu l'avantage de salaires relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux et de bons avantages sociaux. Cela laisse entendre que l'employeur peut agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire, tant qu'il paie bien ses employ\u00e9s, sans d\u00e9finition de ce que signifie relativement g\u00e9n\u00e9reux ou sans comparaison.\n[129] Le 1er avril 2006, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 la CCDP.\nB. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [130] La question soulev\u00e9e en l'esp\u00e8ce est la suivante : la Compagnie a t elle agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers la plaignante en cours d'emploi, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP, en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de sa situation de famille?\nC. LE DROIT ET LA TH\u00c8SE EN L'ESP\u00c8CE (i) Les dispositions pertinentes de la LCDP [131] L'article 3 de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que la situation de famille est un motif de distinction illicite.\n3. (1) Pour l'application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les motifs de distinction illicite sont ceux qui sont fond\u00e9s sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e ou la d\u00e9ficience.\n3. (1) For all purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability and conviction for which a pardon has been granted.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[132] L'article 7 est \u00e9crit comme suit :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, , par des moyens directs ou indirects;\nde refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\nto refuse to employ or continue to employ any individual, or in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[133] L'article 10 de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit :\n10. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et s'il est susceptible d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus, le fait, pour l'employeur, l'association patronale or l'organisation syndicale;\nde fixer ou d'appliquer des lignes de conduite; de conclure des ententes touchant le recrutement, les mises en rapport, l'engagement, les promotions, la formation, l'apprentissage, les mutations ou tout autre aspect d'un emploi pr\u00e9sent ou \u00e9ventuel.\n10. It is a discriminatory practice for an employer, employee organization or employer organization\nto establish or pursue a policy or practice, or to enter into an agreement affecting recruitment, referral, hiring, promotion, training, apprenticeship, transfer or any other matter relating to employment or prospective employment, that deprives or tends to deprive an individual or class of individuals of any employment opportunities on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[134] Lors de l'examen des articles 7 et 10, il est important que le Tribunal souligne l'objet de la LCDP tel qu'il est \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'article 2 :\n2. La pr\u00e9sente loi a pour objet de completer la l\u00e9gislation canadienne en donnant effet, dans le champ de comp\u00e9tence du Parlement du Canada, au principe suivant : le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur la race, l'origine nationale ou ethnique, la couleur, la religion, l'\u00e2ge, le sexe, l'orientation sexuelle, l'\u00e9tat matrimonial, la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience ou l'\u00e9tat de personne graci\u00e9e.\n2. The purpose of this Act is to extend the laws in Canada to give effect, within the purview of matters coming within the legislative authority of Parliament, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered in or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.\n[135] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d'autres cours ont toujours soutenu qu'il fallait interpr\u00e9ter les droits de la personne d'une fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. Dans l'arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 :\n24. La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu'en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu'elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu'offre la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu'elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s'interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\n(ii) Le droit a) La preuve prima facie [136] Le fardeau initial revient \u00e0 la plaignante, qui doit \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille. Une preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. (Voir Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons - Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 558.)\n[137] Lorsque le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il a droit \u00e0 un redressement en l'absence d'une justification de la partie intim\u00e9e. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202, \u00e0 la page 208.) Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, la plaignante doit, en l'esp\u00e8ce, \u00e9tablir qu'elle a subi une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable et qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP.\nb) Quelle approche doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille? [138] L'\u00e9valuation de l'existence d'un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille doit suivre les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans l'arr\u00eat Public Service Labour Relations Commission c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 (Meiorin), tout comme tout autre motif de distinction illicite. Cependant, dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, l'interpr\u00e9tation de la notion de situation de famille a entra\u00een\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation de deux \u00e9coles de pens\u00e9es distinctes. Dans certains cas, on a adopt\u00e9 une approche large pour la port\u00e9e de la situation de famille, alors que d'autres ont suivi une approche plus restreinte. Afin de mieux comprendre ce qui est inclus dans la notion de situation de famille, j'examinerai un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions.\n[139] Dans la d\u00e9cision Schaap c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re de la D\u00e9fense nationale), [1988] D.C.D.P. no 4, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir si des relations form\u00e9es par une union de fait, par opposition \u00e0 celles form\u00e9es par un mariage l\u00e9gal, relevaient des groupes prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de l' \u00e9tat matrimonial et de la situation de famille. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu qu'il devait exister un lien du sang ou un lien l\u00e9gal et il a d\u00e9fini la situation de famille comme comprenant tant les liens du sang entre le parent et l'enfant que la relation qui d\u00e9coule des liens du mariage, de la consanguinit\u00e9 ou de l'adoption l\u00e9gale, y compris, bien entendu, la relation ancestrale, qu'elle soit l\u00e9gitime, ill\u00e9gitime ou par adoption, ainsi que les liens entre les \u00e9poux, les fr\u00e8res et surs, la belle famille, les oncles ou les tantes et les neveux ou les ni\u00e8ces. Dans la d\u00e9cision Lang c. Canada (Commission de l'emploi et de l'Immigration), [1990] D.C.D.P. no 8, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 3 : Dans l'opinion du Tribunal, l'expression situation de famille comprend la relation parent-enfant.\n[140] Dans la d\u00e9cision Brown c. Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Douanes et accise), (1993) T.D. 7\/93, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux pages 14 et 18 :\nDans le cas du motif b) [la situation de famille], la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res.\n[...]\nL'avocate de la plaignante ne pr\u00e9tend pas que l'employeur est responsable des soins et de l'\u00e9ducation des enfants. Elle soutient cependant qu'il faut reconna\u00eetre, dans le contexte de la situation de famille, l'existence d'un \u00e9quilibre entre les int\u00e9r\u00eats et les obligations d\u00e9coulant de l'article 2 et du paragraphe 7b) de la LCDP.\nUn parent doit donc \u00e9valuer avec soin comment il peut le mieux s'acquitter de ses obligations ainsi que de ses devoirs au sein de la famille. \u00c0 cette fin, il doit demander \u00e0 l'employeur de l'aider pour qu'il r\u00e9ponde le mieux possible \u00e0 ces besoins.\nIl est donc facile de comprendre le dilemme \u00e9vident auquel la famille moderne est confront\u00e9e. En effet, selon la tendance socio-\u00e9conomique actuelle, les deux parents travaillent et sont souvent assujettis \u00e0 des r\u00e8gles et \u00e0 des exigences diff\u00e9rentes. Plus souvent qu'autrement, en raison des demandes qui lui sont impos\u00e9es comme parent, la m\u00e8re doit chercher \u00e0 atteindre cet \u00e9quilibre d\u00e9licat entre les besoins de la famille et les exigences li\u00e9es \u00e0 son travail.\n[141] Le Tribunal a enfin conclu que l'interpr\u00e9tation t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique qui doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la LCDP servait d'indication claire que dans le contexte de la situation de famille, le parent a le droit et l'obligation d'\u00e9tablir cet \u00e9quilibre, et l'employeur a l'obligation claire de faciliter et d'accommoder cet \u00e9quilibre en fonction des crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par la jurisprudence. Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu' [u]ne interpr\u00e9tation moins s\u00e9rieuse des probl\u00e8mes auxquels la famille moderne fait face dans le milieu de travail enl\u00e8verait tout son sens au concept de la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination.\n[142] Le Tribunal a aussi examin\u00e9 la situation de famille comme motif de distinction illicite dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2006] D.C.D.P. no 33. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9finition judiciaire de l'expression situation de famille, ainsi que des d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes du Tribunal qui pr\u00e9cisaient les exigences pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif. Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 :\n117 La discrimination fond\u00e9e sur ce motif a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie par la jurisprudence comme s'entendant de [...] mesures ou d'attitudes qui ont pour effet de limiter les conditions d'embauche ou les perspectives d'emploi des employ\u00e9s sur la base d'une caract\u00e9ristique li\u00e9e \u00e0 leur [...] famille (Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) c. M. A et al, [2000] O.J. no 4275 (C.A.); confirm\u00e9 par [2002] A.C.S. no 67].\n118 Dans une d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 l'affaire Ontario, mais clairement conforme \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition qu'on y retrouve, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les exigences en mati\u00e8re de preuve qui permettent d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie :\n[...] la preuve doit indiquer que la situation de famille comprend le fait d'\u00eatre parent et les t\u00e2ches et obligations de cette personne comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que la plaignante \u00e9tait un parent qui devait remplir ces t\u00e2ches et obligations. La preuve doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que, en raison de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations ainsi que de la r\u00e8gle de l'emploi impartial, la plaignante n'a pas eu de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res (Brown c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national, Douanes et Accise), [1993] D.C.D.P. no 7, \u00e0 la page 13). (Voir \u00e9galement Woiden et al c. Dan Lynn, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 18, T.D. 09\/02.)\n[143] Cependant, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie Britannique a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une version diff\u00e9rente des \u00e9l\u00e9ments n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie, dans l'arr\u00eat Health Sciences Assn. of British Columbia c. Campbell River and North Island Transition Society, [2004] B.C.J. no 922, aux paragraphes 38 et 39 (Campbell River), une d\u00e9cision sur laquelle la Compagnie s'est fortement appuy\u00e9e dans ses conclusions finales. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour d'appel de la Colombie Britannique a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les param\u00e8tres de la situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de distinction illicite dans le Human Rights Code de la Colombie Britannique ne doivent pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on trop large, sinon cela pourrait causer [TRADUCTION] de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux en milieu de travail. La Cour a expliqu\u00e9 qu'une preuve prima facie est \u00e9tablie [TRADUCTION] lorsqu'un changement dans une condition d'emploi impos\u00e9e par l'employeur entra\u00eene une atteinte grave envers une obligation ou un devoir parental important, ou une obligation ou un devoir familial, de l'employ\u00e9. Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original. Le juge Low a observ\u00e9 qu'il serait difficile d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie dans les cas de conflit entre les exigences du travail et les obligations familiales.\n[144] Dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, le Tribunal n'a pas suivi l'approche pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 sa position au sujet de cette d\u00e9cision comme suit :\n120 Avec d\u00e9f\u00e9rence, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l'analyse de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie-Britannique. Les codes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, en raison de leur statut de loi fondamentale, doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale afin qu'ils puissent mieux r\u00e9aliser leurs objectifs (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, \u00e0 la page 547, Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, aux pages 1134 \u00e0 1136; Robichaud c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor), [1987] 2 R.C.S. 84, aux pages 89 et 90). Il serait, \u00e0 mon avis, inappropri\u00e9 de choisir un motif de distinction illicite et de lui donner une d\u00e9finition plus restrictive.\n121 \u00c0 mon humble avis, les pr\u00e9occupations d\u00e9finies par la Cour d'appel, \u00e0 savoir la perturbation grave et les torts s\u00e9rieux sur le lieu de travail, peuvent \u00eatre des questions appropri\u00e9es \u00e0 examiner suivant l'analyse de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, et en particulier suivant le troisi\u00e8me volet de l'analyse, \u00e0 savoir la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 raisonnable. Dans le contexte de l'\u00e9valuation de l'importance de la contrainte, il se peut qu'une mesure d'accommodement donne lieu \u00e0 des questions comme la perturbation grave sur le lieu de travail et l'effet grave sur le moral des employ\u00e9s, qui sont des facteurs appropri\u00e9s (voir l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521). Il appartient \u00e0 l'employeur d'\u00e9tablir au cas par cas l'existence d'une contrainte excessive. Une simple crainte que la mesure d'accommodement entra\u00eenerait une contrainte excessive n'est pas un motif appropri\u00e9, \u00e0 mon humble avis, pour \u00e9carter l'analyse. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[145] En plus de la logique convaincante de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt du Tribunal pour ne pas suivre l'approche de Campbell River, le Tribunal conclut que l'approche sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e dans cet arr\u00eat impose un fardeau additionnel au plaignant en sous entendant que la situation de famille, qui est prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, n\u00e9cessite la preuve d'une [TRADUCTION] atteinte grave envers une obligation ou un devoir parental ou familial et que cela ne correspond pas \u00e0 l'objet de la LCDP. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l'a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), [2002] 3 R.C.S. 403, au paragraphe 56, il n'est pas appropri\u00e9, lors de l'interpr\u00e9tation de lois sur les droits de la personne, d'imposer des fardeaux additionnels.\n[146] L'approche du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. no 43, aux paragraphes 29 et 30. Il s'agissait d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Johnstone \u00e0 l'encontre de la d\u00e9cision de la CCDP de ne pas renvoyer au Tribunal sa plainte dans laquelle elle soutenait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille.\n[147] Dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accept\u00e9 l'approche du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [...] rien ne justifie clairement qu'il faille consid\u00e9rer ce type de discrimination comme secondaire ou moins important. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29). La Cour a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la suggestion de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River selon laquelle une discrimination prima facie n'existe que lorsque l'employeur change les conditions d'emploi semble inapplicable et, \u00e0 mon humble avis, erron\u00e9e en droit. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 29). La Cour a aussi conclu que la CCDP, en adoptant le crit\u00e8re de l'atteinte grave lorsqu'elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas renvoyer l'affaire au Tribunal, a aussi omis de se conformer aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents permettant clairement d'\u00e9tablir s'il y a discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. (Johnstone, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30.)\n[148] La d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Johnstone a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenue par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, bien que la Cour d'appel e\u00fbt pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle n'exprimait pas d'opinion sur la version appropri\u00e9e du crit\u00e8re portant sur l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a plut\u00f4t fond\u00e9 son raisonnement sur la conclusion que le d\u00e9faut de la CCDP de cibler clairement le crit\u00e8re qu'elle avait appliqu\u00e9 constituait un fondement suffisant pour conclure que la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Commission \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. ([2008] A.C.F. no 427, au paragraphe 2).\n[149] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Johnstone (voir Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, 2010 TCDP 20). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a conclu :\n[220] Le Tribunal accepte que ce ne sont pas toutes les tensions qui ont lieu dans le contexte de l'\u00e9quilibre travail\/vie-personnelle qui peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es par la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, mais ce n'est pas l'argument qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'argument de Mme Johnstone est qu'une telle protection devrait \u00eatre donn\u00e9e lorsque appropri\u00e9e et raisonnable, compte tenu des circonstances pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[221] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, nous traitons ici du cas d'une vraie personne qui a des obligations envers ses jeunes enfants et des r\u00e9percussions importantes sur la capacit\u00e9 de cette personne de remplir cette obligation. Il ne revient pas au Tribunal de traiter de toutes les obligations familiales et de tous les conflits entre le travail d'un employ\u00e9 et ses obligations.\n[...]\n[230] [...] le Tribunal conclut que rien dans l'article 2 ne cr\u00e9e une interpr\u00e9tation restrictive et \u00e9troite de la situation de famille.\n[231] Au contraire, l'objectif sous-jacent de la LCDP, comme je l'ai dit, est de fournir \u00e0 toute personne un m\u00e9canisme garantissant le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins [...]. Il est raisonnable que les protections fournies comprennent celles d\u00e9coulant naturellement de l'une des relations les plus fondamentales de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui existent, celles du p\u00e8re ou de la m\u00e8re envers son enfant. Le fait que le libell\u00e9 de l'article 2 mentionne l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d'\u00e9panouissement prouve que la LCDP reconna\u00eet que les individus font des choix distincts, y compris celui d'avoir des enfants, et que la LCDP prot\u00e8ge tous les individus contre la discrimination envers ces choix.\n[...]\n[233] Le Tribunal conclut que la libert\u00e9 de choisir de devenir p\u00e8re ou m\u00e8re est si vitale qu'elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre restreinte par la crainte de subir des cons\u00e9quences discriminatoires. En tant que soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le Canada devrait reconna\u00eetre cette libert\u00e9 fondamentale et appuyer ce choix autant que possible. Pour l'employeur, cela signifie \u00e9valuer les situations telles que celles de Mme Johnstone de fa\u00e7on individuelle et travailler avec elle pour cr\u00e9er une solution fonctionnelle qui \u00e9quilibre ses obligations parentales avec ses occasions d'emploi, sauf contrainte excessive.\n[150] R\u00e9cemment, le Tribunal de la dotation de la fonction publique (le TDFP) a examin\u00e9 s'il fallait suivre l'approche pour la situation de famille \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt ou celle \u00e9tablie dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River et a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'il appliquerait l'approche de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt. Dans la d\u00e9cision Chantal Rajotte c. Le pr\u00e9sident de l'Agence canadienne des services frontaliers et al, 2009 TDFP 0025, le TDFP a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'approche \u00e0 adopter est celle contenue dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, laquelle a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 admise par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone (paragraphe 127). Le TDFP a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\nLa preuve doit donc d\u00e9montrer que la plaignante est un parent, qu'elle doit remplir des t\u00e2ches et des obligations comme membre de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et que, de surcro\u00eet, elle est un parent devant remplir ces t\u00e2ches et ces obligations. La plaignante doit prouver qu'en cons\u00e9quence de ces t\u00e2ches et obligations et de la conduite de l'intim\u00e9, elle n'a pas b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de chances de travail \u00e9gales et enti\u00e8res. (Paragraphe 127)\n[151] Un examen de certaines d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9centes du Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie Britannique (le BCHRT) d\u00e9montre que les d\u00e9cisions de ce Tribunal ne suivent pas uniform\u00e9ment l'approche de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Par exemple, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que cette approche n'\u00e9tait pas applicable dans le cas de la fourniture de services (Stephenson c. Sooke Lake Modular Home Co-operative Association, 2007 BCHRT 341). Cette approche a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e dans deux d\u00e9cisions du BCHRT qui portaient sur une situation d'emploi (Haggerty c. Kamloops Society for Community Living, [2008] BCHRT 172, au paragraphe 17 et Mahdi c. Hertz Canada Limited, [2008] BCHRT 245, aux paragraphes 60 et 61).\n[152] Dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau c. Ferguson Moving (1990) Ltd., dba Ferguson Moving and Storage et al., 2009 BCHRT 272, le BCHRT a mentionn\u00e9 les d\u00e9cisions Campbell River, Hoyt et Johnstone, ainsi qu'une autre de ses d\u00e9cisions dans l'affaire Miller c. BCTF (no 2), 2009 BCHRT 34. Le BCHRT a soulign\u00e9 que, dans la d\u00e9cision Miller, il avait conclu que le crit\u00e8re de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River ne s'appliquait que dans le contexte dans lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9. Le BCHRT a cit\u00e9 l'extrait suivant de la d\u00e9cision Miller : [TRADUCTION] La formulation [dans Campbell River] de ce qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille dans le contexte d'un conflit entre les obligations d'emploi et les obligations familiales ne doit pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e m\u00e9caniquement dans tous les cas de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (Falardeau, au paragraphe 29).\n[153] La question en litige dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau \u00e9tait celle de savoir si un employ\u00e9, qui avait refus\u00e9 d'effectuer des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales qu'il avait envers son fils, avait subi de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le Tribunal a conclu que le plaignant n'avait pas \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 31 et 32 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nEn l'esp\u00e8ce, Ferguson souhaitait maintenir un mod\u00e8le bien \u00e9tabli d'heures suppl\u00e9mentaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de ses clients. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 M. Falardeau a avis\u00e9 les intim\u00e9s de ses besoins et de ses ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde, les intim\u00e9s croyaient, avec raison selon la preuve dont je suis saisi, que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait ais\u00e9ment capable d'organiser des services de garde pour son fils si ses heures de travail se prolongeaient. En effet, il l'avait fait de nombreuses fois. Le fait que ni le mod\u00e8le de travail de M. Falardeau ni ses demandes ou ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde n'avaient chang\u00e9 laissent entendre qu'il avait peut \u00eatre soulev\u00e9 la question des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison du fait qu'il n'aimait pas travailler sur les sites de construction, plut\u00f4t qu'en raison de ses responsabilit\u00e9s familiales.\nRien ne donne \u00e0 penser que son fils avait des besoins sp\u00e9ciaux, ou que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait exceptionnellement qualifi\u00e9 pour prendre soin de son fils. Bien que ces facteurs ne soient pas essentiels pour \u00e9tablir une obligation parentale importante, la preuve en l'esp\u00e8ce n'a \u00e9tabli aucun autre facteur qui exempterait M. Falardeau des obligations ordinaires d'un parent qui doit jongler entre les demandes de son emploi et le besoin de fournir des soins appropri\u00e9s \u00e0 ses enfants. Compte tenu de ces faits, je ne peux pas conclure qu'il y a eu atteinte grave aux obligations ou aux devoirs importants parentaux ou familiaux. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[154] Dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau, le BCHRT a essentiellement suivi le raisonnement formul\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River. Cependant, m\u00eame s'il avait suivi l'approche dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, sa conclusion aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 la m\u00eame. La principale diff\u00e9rence entre la situation dans la d\u00e9cision Falardeau et celle en l'esp\u00e8ce est que, dans l'affaire Falardeau, il n'y avait eu aucun changement dans l'horaire de travail de M. Falardeau ou dans ses besoins ou ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde. De plus, son employeur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de ses besoins et de ses ententes en mati\u00e8re de services de garde et il croyait, avec raison, que M. Falardeau \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 obtenir des services de garde pour son fils si ses heures de travail \u00e9taient prolong\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Falardeau avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, parce qu'il n'avait pas prouv\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait incapable de participer \u00e9galement et enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 son emploi en raison de ses obligations et de ses devoirs en tant que p\u00e8re.\n[155] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante, en \u00e9tant forc\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, faisait face \u00e0 une atteinte grave \u00e0 ses devoirs et obligations de m\u00e8re. L'affaire aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si la plaignante avait refus\u00e9 d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9e \u00e0 son terminal local.\n[156] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la Compagnie a soutenu que la position de la plaignante \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une pr\u00e9misse erron\u00e9e. Il a qualifi\u00e9 la plainte de demande visant \u00e0 ce que l'employeur prenne des mesures d'accommodement pour les [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales et les choix de vie de la plaignante. Il a ajout\u00e9 que cette position \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une interpr\u00e9tation extr\u00eamement large de la LCDP et que la seule caract\u00e9ristique soulev\u00e9e par la plaignante qui pouvait d\u00e9clencher la protection pr\u00e9vue par la loi \u00e9tait le fait qu'elle est une m\u00e8re et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle doit prendre soin de ses enfants. L'avocat a ajout\u00e9 que le fait d'exiger qu'un employ\u00e9 qui a des enfants respecte sa responsabilit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9senter au travail comme l'exige la convention collective ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination. En fait, il a soutenu que le refus d'un employ\u00e9 de respecter ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet constitue un choix qui est de nature exclusivement personnelle et pour lequel, en l'absence de circonstances exceptionnelles, un employeur n'a aucune obligation d'accommodement. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a conclu que le fait d'accueillir la plainte en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 ajouter les [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales \u00e0 la liste des motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP, sous le couvert de l'expansion de la notion de situation de famille.\n[157] \u00c0 l'appui de ces arguments, l'avocat a mentionn\u00e9 de nombreuses d\u00e9cisions, y compris la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel de la Colombie Britannique dans l'arr\u00eat Campbell River, qui, \u00e0 son avis, pr\u00e9sentait une approche plus structur\u00e9e et pragmatique que celle de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt du Tribunal. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision arbitrale Canadian Staff Union c. Canadian Union of Public Employees, (2006) 88 C.L.A.S. 212. Dans cette affaire, le plaignant avait refus\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Halifax apr\u00e8s avoir pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste pour lequel il \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9 que le lieu d'emploi serait Halifax. Le plaignant habitait \u00e0 St. John's (Terre-Neuve), o\u00f9 il avait la garde partag\u00e9e de ses enfants avec son ancienne \u00e9pouse. Il \u00e9tait aussi responsable de prendre soin de sa m\u00e8re \u00e2g\u00e9e. Le Syndicat a soutenu que la notion de situation de famille ne se limitait pas au statut de p\u00e8re ou de m\u00e8re comme tel, mais s'\u00e9tendait aussi \u00e0 l'accommodement des responsabilit\u00e9s familiales du plaignant.\n[158] Le grief soulevait des questions importantes de droits de la personne qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sum\u00e9es comme suit : [TRADUCTION] la d\u00e9signation par un employeur d'un lieu g\u00e9ographique pr\u00e9cis dans un affichage d'emploi, et l'insistance par celui-ci qu'un employ\u00e9 qui souhaite obtenir ce poste habite \u00e0 un endroit o\u00f9 il peut r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 ce lieu, constitue-t-elle une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial ou la situation de famille, si les responsabilit\u00e9s matrimoniales et familiales de l'employ\u00e9 l'emp\u00eachent r\u00e9ellement d'habiter l\u00e0 o\u00f9 il peut se pr\u00e9senter r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au travail au lieu pr\u00e9cis\u00e9? (au paragraphe 6).\n[159] L'arbitre a rejet\u00e9 le grief au motif que [TRADUCTION] au sens de toute loi pertinente en l'esp\u00e8ce et de la convention collective, c'\u00e9tait le choix du plaignant, et non ses responsabilit\u00e9s matrimoniales et familiales, qui l'emp\u00eachait de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Halifax (au paragraphe 9). L'arbitre a ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] ce que l'employeur a fait ne constitue pas une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l'\u00e9tat matrimonial ou sur la situation de famille et l'employeur n'\u00e9tait pas tenu par la loi de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour le plaignant jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive.\n[160] Dans son analyse des d\u00e9cisions pertinentes, l'arbitre a adopt\u00e9 l'approche restreinte de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River au sujet de l'interpr\u00e9tation de la situation de famille. Bien que la d\u00e9cision soit int\u00e9ressante, le Tribunal note que les faits li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision arbitrale sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans la d\u00e9cision arbitrale, le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste, sachant pertinemment que la description de poste pr\u00e9cisait que l'emploi \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Halifax. Le plaignant avait le choix de refuser d'aller \u00e0 Halifax et de rester dans son poste \u00e0 St. John's, ce qui n'\u00e9tait pas le cas de la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce, dont le choix \u00e9tait de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ou \u00eatre cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Les faits donnent aussi \u00e0 penser qu'il n'y avait pas d'augmentation de salaire ou d'avantages importants pour le poste \u00e0 Halifax par rapport \u00e0 celui de St. John's et que le plaignant avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature parce qu'il souhaitait vivre un changement et de nouveaux d\u00e9fis (paragraphe 15). Le Tribunal note aussi que l'un des enfants du plaignant avait 19 ans et commen\u00e7ait l'universit\u00e9 et que l'autre avait 15 ans et commen\u00e7ait l'\u00e9cole secondaire et que, comme l'arbitre l'a mentionn\u00e9, bien que les fils du plaignant tiraient sans aucun doute des avantages importants de sa pr\u00e9sence r\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00e0 St. John's, ils n'avaient besoin d'aucun soin sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 de sa part et il pouvait s'organiser pour assurer leur bien \u00eatre en son absence (au paragraphe 141).\n[161] L'avocat de la Compagnie a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario Wight c. Ontario (no 2), 33 C.H.R.R. D\/191, qui portait sur une employ\u00e9e qui, \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9, avait refus\u00e9 de retourner au travail en soutenant qu'elle \u00e9tait incapable d'obtenir des services de garde appropri\u00e9s. Elle a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e au motif qu'elle avait abandonn\u00e9 son poste. Dans cette affaire, le Tribunal a conclu que la plaignante avait [TRADUCTION] cat\u00e9goriquement refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre les attentes raisonnables de son employeur qu'elle prenne les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour retourner au travail \u00e0 la fin de son cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9. Le Tribunal a \u00e9crit : [TRADUCTION] Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'elle allait \u00eatre en cong\u00e9 de maternit\u00e9 jusqu'en octobre au plus t\u00f4t ou en janvier au plus tard (au paragraphe 321). Le Tribunal a ajout\u00e9 qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'un cas d'une personne qui, malgr\u00e9 ses efforts, ne pouvait pas trouver de services de garde pour son enfant et devait choisir entre son enfant et son emploi. Une fois de plus, il s'agit d'une situation dont les faits diff\u00e8rent beaucoup de la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[162] L'avocat a aussi mentionn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision Smith c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2008 TCDP 15, une d\u00e9cision rendue en mai 2008 par le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. Le Tribunal ne voit pas en quoi cette d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre comparable \u00e0 la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce. Dans l'affaire Smith, bien que le plaignant e\u00fbt soutenu, entre autres, qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, le Tribunal a conclu que ce motif de discrimination n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 dans la plainte et qu'aucune jurisprudence n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour d\u00e9montrer que les faits constituaient une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille (au paragraphe 289).\n[163] L'avocat de la Compagnie a finalement mentionn\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions rendues par le Bureau d'arbitrage des chemins de fer canadiens (le Bureau). Bien qu'elles soient int\u00e9ressantes, toutes les d\u00e9cisions du Bureau sont fond\u00e9es sur des faits particuliers et elles ne nous aident pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer le crit\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 appliquer en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[164] Le Tribunal ne souscrit pas non plus \u00e0 l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel un concept ouvert de la situation de famille donnerait lieu \u00e0 une avalanche de demandes et que cela risquerait de causer de la perturbation ou des torts s\u00e9rieux au travail. Comme la Human Rights and Citizenship Commission de l'Alberta l'a not\u00e9 au paragraphe 242 de sa d\u00e9cision Rawleigh c. Canada Safeway Ltd, rendue le 29 septembre 2009, [TRADUCTION] chaque affaire doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e en fonction des faits qui lui sont propres. Le fait d'appuyer la croyance qu'une avalanche pourrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e par des personnes opportunistes est tr\u00e8s dangereux et possiblement discriminatoire.\n[165] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et d'autres cours ont toujours soutenu que les droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on large et lib\u00e9rale. Dans l'arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) (Action Travail des Femmes), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 24 :\n24. La l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne vise notamment \u00e0 favoriser l'essor des droits individuels d'importance vitale, lesquels sont susceptibles d'\u00eatre mis \u00e0 ex\u00e9cution, en derni\u00e8re analyse, devant une cour de justice. Je reconnais qu'en interpr\u00e9tant la Loi, les termes qu'elle utilise doivent recevoir leur sens ordinaire, mais il est tout aussi important de reconna\u00eetre et de donner effet pleinement aux droits qui y sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. On ne devrait pas chercher par toutes sortes de fa\u00e7ons \u00e0 les minimiser ou \u00e0 diminuer leur effet. Bien que cela puisse sembler banal, il peut \u00eatre sage de se rappeler ce guide qu'offre la Loi d'interpr\u00e9tation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu'elle pr\u00e9cise que les textes de loi sont cens\u00e9s \u00eatre r\u00e9parateurs et doivent ainsi s'interpr\u00e9ter de la fa\u00e7on juste, large et lib\u00e9rale la plus propre \u00e0 assurer la r\u00e9alisation de leurs objets.\n[166] Selon l'analyse pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, le Tribunal conclut qu'il existe deux interpr\u00e9tations diff\u00e9rentes dans la jurisprudence au sujet de l'\u00e9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille : l'interpr\u00e9tation de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River et l'interpr\u00e9tation de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt. Le Tribunal est d'avis que l'approche de l'arr\u00eat Campbell River a pour effet d'imposer une hi\u00e9rarchie des motifs de discrimination, certains motifs, comme la situation de famille, \u00e9tant consid\u00e9r\u00e9s moins importants que les autres. Cette approche ne suit pas l'objet de la LCDP. De plus, toutes les permutations de l'approche appliqu\u00e9e au motif de la situation de famille en Colombie Britannique qui ont suivi l'arr\u00eat Campbell River appuient la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle la situation de famille ne devrait pas \u00eatre isol\u00e9e sous une norme diff\u00e9rente et plus s\u00e9v\u00e8re ou plus lourde d'\u00e9tablissement de la preuve prima facie. La seule solution est d'appliquer le m\u00eame crit\u00e8re que celui appliqu\u00e9 pour les autres motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP. Cette approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt et a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone.\n[167] Par cons\u00e9quent, je suivrai l'approche \u00e9tablie dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, qui respecte le principe des droits de la personne selon lequel tous les motifs de discrimination doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale.\n[168] De plus, tenant compte de la nature et du statut sp\u00e9ciaux des lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne en tant que lois quasi constitutionnelles, le Tribunal conclut que l'interpr\u00e9tation et l'application de la situation de famille telles qu'elles sont propos\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision Hoyt sont celles qu'il convient d'adopter. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 auparavant, les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on lib\u00e9rale et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, selon laquelle les droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s re\u00e7oivent une interpr\u00e9tation large, alors que les exceptions et les d\u00e9fenses sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on plus restreinte.\nc) Une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille a t elle \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie? [169] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, le Tribunal, appliquant l'approche de la d\u00e9cision Hoyt, conclut que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. En raison de ses obligations familiales, elle a perdu son emploi, alors que d'autres employ\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9s.\n[170] La preuve \u00e9tablit que la plaignante est divorc\u00e9e et qu'elle a la garde principale de ses deux enfants qui, en juillet 2005, avaient 10 et 11 ans. L'ordonnance de divorce et l'entente de garde partag\u00e9e pr\u00e9cisaient que les deux parents auraient la garde partag\u00e9e des enfants, la plaignante leur fournissant la r\u00e9sidence principale. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 qu'aucune partie ne devait r\u00e9sider \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de Jasper avec les enfants, sans donner un pr\u00e9avis \u00e9crit de d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement quatre vingt dix (90) jours au pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l'autre partie.\n[171] En 2005, la plaignante \u00e9tait en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 la Compagnie. En f\u00e9vrier 2005, la Compagnie lui a demand\u00e9 combien de temps il lui faudrait pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 not\u00e9, l'ordonnance de divorce obligeait la plaignante \u00e0 fournir un avis de quatre vingt dix (90) jours si elle voulait d\u00e9m\u00e9nager avec ses enfants loin du p\u00e8re. Compte tenu de la dur\u00e9e inconnue de la p\u00e9nurie et des difficult\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant de la s\u00e9paration des enfants de leur \u00e9cole, de leur p\u00e8re, de leurs amis et de leur communaut\u00e9, la plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait impossible pour elle de se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie.\n[172] La plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Compagnie pour expliquer sa situation de famille et les difficult\u00e9s qui y \u00e9taient li\u00e9es. Elle a avis\u00e9 la Compagnie qu'elle ne pouvait pas se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver et elle a demand\u00e9 un [TRADUCTION] un cong\u00e9 de compassion. Le 18 mars 2005, elle a de nouveau \u00e9crit \u00e0 la Compagnie pour expliquer que bien que trente (30) jours seraient suffisants pour qu'elle avise son employeur actuel, ses difficult\u00e9s et sa situation unique \u00e0 titre de m\u00e8re seule ne lui permettaient pas de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Dans une autre lettre dat\u00e9e du 1er mai 2005, elle a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Torchia les circonstances de sa situation familiale et de sa situation quant aux soins \u00e0 ses enfants et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait possible de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager ses enfants \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[173] La preuve \u00e9tablit que les chefs de train sur les chemins de fer ont des horaires impr\u00e9visibles et pourtant, la plaignante avait pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour satisfaire \u00e0 la gamme compl\u00e8te de ses obligations \u00e0 titre de chef de train, y compris \u00eatre sur appel \u00e0 deux heures d'avis, sept jours par semaine, pour pouvoir travailler \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur de Jasper. Le seul probl\u00e8me pour elle \u00e9tait qu'elle ne pouvait pas laisser sa famille \u00e0 Jasper au moment de la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[174] La plaignante n'a jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses lettres. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales telles que la garde d'enfants n'\u00e9taient pas des [TRADUCTION] raisons satisfaisantes pour qu'un employ\u00e9 soit exempt\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie. La Compagnie \u00e9tait d'avis que la situation de la plaignante ne n\u00e9cessitait pas d'accommodement en raison de sa situation de famille au sens de la LCDP. Elle \u00e9tait aussi d'avis que la situation de la plaignante \u00e9tait un choix personnel de ne pas respecter ses obligations professionnelles afin de donner priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 d'autres aspects de sa vie, une situation que la Compagnie a qualifi\u00e9 d'\u00e9quilibre [TRADUCTION] travail famille.\n[175] En contre interrogatoire, M. Torchia a reconnu que les pr\u00e9occupations de la plaignante \u00e9taient l\u00e9gitimes et qu'elle avait droit \u00e0 des mesures d'accommodement. Cependant, \u00e0 son avis, la plaignante avait simplement besoin de plus de temps pour r\u00e9gler sa situation et c'est ce qu'il lui a accord\u00e9. Il a aussi ajout\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait [TRADUCTION] injuste de conclure qu'il n'avait pas appliqu\u00e9 la politique en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement de la Compagnie : [TRADUCTION] Elles [la plaignante, Kasha Whyte et Denise Seeley] avaient des pr\u00e9occupations familiales et j'ai pris des mesures d'accommodement pour elles en prolongeant le d\u00e9lai qu'elles avaient pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver. Ces mesures d'accommodement visaient \u00e0 leur donner le temps de s'organiser. Elles ne l'ont pas fait et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9es. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter qu'il a aussi ajout\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] Dans le cas des deux plaignantes [Cindy Richards et Kasha Whyte], j'\u00e9tais d'avis qu'elles avaient des raisons satisfaisantes et c'est pourquoi je leur ai accord\u00e9 une prorogation du d\u00e9lai lorsque j'ai pris connaissance de leur situation. Pourtant cee n'est pas la position que la Compagnie avait adopt\u00e9e devant l'arbitre.\n[176] Le Tribunal conclut que le droit n'appuie simplement pas le point de vue de la Compagnie selon lequel la situation de famille ne comprend pas la situation de la plaignante. La situation de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de m\u00e8re seule de deux enfants ainsi que les ramifications, qu'elle a expliqu\u00e9es dans ses diverses lettres, du fait de lui ordonner de se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver la placent dans la d\u00e9finition de situation de famille. Elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 des mesures d'accommodement \u00e0 la Compagnie et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande aux responsables de la Compagnie. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont expliqu\u00e9 qu'une telle demande aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 qui en l'esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait Colin Pizziol, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper. Malheureusement, M. Pizziol n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et les autres t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ne pouvaient pas expliquer de quelle fa\u00e7on il avait g\u00e9r\u00e9 la situation. La preuve incontest\u00e9e de la plaignante \u00e9tait que ni son superviseur, ni un autre gestionnaire de la Compagnie n'avaient r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses lettres ni discut\u00e9 de la situation avec elle.\n[177] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience, le Tribunal conclut que la plaignante a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la plaignante est une m\u00e8re et que ce statut comprend les devoirs et les obligations qui reviennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement aux parents. En raison de ces devoirs et obligations, la plaignante, selon les r\u00e8gles et les pratiques de la Compagnie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de participer de fa\u00e7on \u00e9gale et compl\u00e8te \u00e0 son emploi au sein de la Compagnie. Cela \u00e9tant, le fardeau repose maintenant sur la Compagnie de d\u00e9montrer que la norme ou l'action discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en raison d'une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\nd) La Compagnie a-t-elle pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante? [178] Le crit\u00e8re applicable pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite dans le contexte de l'emploi et si un employeur a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour un employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive est celui \u00e9tabli par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin. Dans cet arr\u00eat, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a normalis\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re applicable quant \u00e0 la discrimination et a rejet\u00e9 l'ancienne distinction entre la discrimination directe et indirecte.\n[179] Lorsqu'un plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le fardeau est alors transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'employeur, qui doit d\u00e9montrer que l'acte ou la norme discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue \u00e9tait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e (EPJ). \u00c0 ce sujet, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 aux paragraphes 54 et 55 de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin :\nL'employeur peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\nqu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause; qu'il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail; que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu'il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\nCette m\u00e9thode est fond\u00e9e sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir des normes qui composent avec l'apport potentiel de tous les employ\u00e9s dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela peut \u00eatre fait sans que l'employeur subisse une contrainte excessive. Il est \u00e9vident que des normes peuvent l\u00e9ser les membres d'un groupe particulier. Mais, comme le juge Wilson l'a fait remarquer dans Central Alberta Dairy Pool, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la p. 518, [s]'il est possible de trouver une solution raisonnable qui \u00e9vite d'imposer une r\u00e8gle donn\u00e9e aux membres d'un groupe, cette r\u00e8gle ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme [une EPJ]. Il s'ensuit que la r\u00e8gle ou la norme jug\u00e9e raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire doit composer avec les diff\u00e9rences individuelles dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne cause aucune contrainte excessive. \u00c0 moins qu'aucun accommodement ne soit possible sans imposer une contrainte excessive, la norme telle qu'elle existe n'est pas une EPJ, et la preuve prima facie de l'existence de discrimination n'est pas r\u00e9fut\u00e9.\nLa norme a t elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour un objectif rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l'ex\u00e9cution du travail?\n[180] Le crit\u00e8re neutre en question en l'esp\u00e8ce est l'exigence de se pr\u00e9senter au travail \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocate de la plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle ne contestait pas que la capacit\u00e9 de la Compagnie d'exiger que des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s soient forc\u00e9s de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie \u00e9tait rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 son objectif d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d'\u00eatre en mesure de transf\u00e9rer des employ\u00e9s rapidement aux endroits o\u00f9 il y a p\u00e9nurie afin de garantir le fonctionnement continu des trains. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle elle m\u00eame comprend la capacit\u00e9 d'un chef de train de ne pas se d\u00e9placer s'il y a une [TRADUCTION] raison satisfaisante.\nL'employeur a t il adopt\u00e9 une norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant de bonne foi qu'elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l'accomplissement de cet objectif l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail?\n[181] Une fois de plus, la plaignante ne contestait pas la croyance de bonne foi selon laquelle, d'un point de vue op\u00e9rationnel, la Compagnie avait besoin d'\u00eatre en mesure de forcer des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des p\u00e9nuries. La preuve des repr\u00e9sentants du Syndicat et de la Compagnie \u00e9tait que ces stipulations avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9es dans la convention collective. Les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ont aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsque le tableau de cong\u00e9s avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, ils ne s'attendaient pas \u00e0 trouver beaucoup de volontaires pour couvrir les p\u00e9nuries et c'est pourquoi la Compagnie a n\u00e9goci\u00e9 pour avoir la capacit\u00e9 de forcer des employ\u00e9s non prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en mise \u00e0 pied \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me.\nLa Compagnie a t elle \u00e9tabli qu'elle ne pouvait pas prendre de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante en raison de contraintes excessives?\n[182] La troisi\u00e8me et derni\u00e8re t\u00e2che de la Compagnie est de d\u00e9montrer que la norme contest\u00e9e est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire afin que l'employeur puisse accomplir son objectif. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, la Compagnie doit \u00e9tablir qu'elle ne peut pas prendre de mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante et les autres personnes n\u00e9gativement touch\u00e9es par la norme sans subir de contrainte excessive. En d'autres mots, comme la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement touch\u00e9e en raison de sa situation de famille par la norme for\u00e7ant les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 couvrir des p\u00e9nuries, la Compagnie aurait elle pu l'accommoder sans subir de contrainte excessive?\n[183] L'utilisation de l'expression excessive laisse entendre qu'une certaine contrainte est acceptable. Ce n'est que la contrainte excessive qui satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re. (Voir Central Okanagan School District no 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970, \u00e0 la page 984.) Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al, du point de vue de l'employeur, de choisir une norme d'une rigidit\u00e9 absolue. Encore est il que, pour \u00eatre justifi\u00e9e en vertu de la l\u00e9gislation sur les droits de la personne, cette norme doit tenir compte de facteurs concernant les capacit\u00e9s uniques ainsi que la valeur et la dignit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rentes de chaque personne, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela n'impose aucune contrainte excessive. (Meiorin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 62.) De plus, lorsqu'un employeur \u00e9value s'il est en mesure d'accommoder un employ\u00e9, il doit effectuer une analyse individuelle de la situation de l'employ\u00e9. \u00c0 ce sujet, dans l'arr\u00eat Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 161, au paragraphe 22, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : Le caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 du processus d'accommodement ne saurait \u00eatre minimis\u00e9.\n[184] Dans l'arr\u00eat Central Alberta Dairy Pool c. Alberta (Commission des droits de la personne), [1990] 2 R.C.S. 489, aux pages 520 et 521, le juge Wilson a examin\u00e9 les facteurs dont il faut tenir compte lors de l'\u00e9valuation de l'obligation d'un employeur d'accommoder un employ\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive. Parmi les facteurs pertinents se trouvent le co\u00fbt financier de la m\u00e9thode possible d'accommodement, l'interchangeabilit\u00e9 relative de l'effectif et des installations et la possibilit\u00e9 d'interf\u00e9rence importante avec les droits d'autres employ\u00e9s. Il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la norme ou la pratique qui exclut des membres d'un groupe particulier en fonction d'hypoth\u00e8ses relevant de l'impression est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement suspecte. (Colombie Britannique (Superintendent of Motor Vehicles) c. Colombie Britannique (Council of Human Rights), [1999] 3 R.C.S. 868 (Grismer), au paragraphe 31.) Les employeurs doivent faire preuve d'innovation, tout en restant pratiques, lorsqu'ils examinent les options d'accommodement dans une situation particuli\u00e8re.\n[185] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocat de la Compagnie a laiss\u00e9 entendre que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada avait reformul\u00e9 les principes qui s'appliquent \u00e0 la notion de contrainte excessive dans l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9 e s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d'Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP FTQ), [2008] 2 R.C.S. 561. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cette interpr\u00e9tation de l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec. Au contraire, le Tribunal conclut que cet arr\u00eat correspond aux d\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes de la Cour supr\u00eame au sujet de la question des accommodements. Dans l'arr\u00eat Hydro Qu\u00e9bec, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que l'employeur n'ait pas l'obligation de changer les conditions de travail de fa\u00e7on fondamentale, il a l'obligation, s'il peut le faire sans contrainte excessive, de modifier le lieu de travail ou les t\u00e2ches d'un employ\u00e9 afin de lui permettre d'effectuer son travail (au paragraphe 16). La Cour supr\u00eame a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu' [e]n raison du caract\u00e8re individualis\u00e9 de l'obligation d'accommodement et de la diversit\u00e9 des circonstances qui peuvent survenir, toute r\u00e8gle rigide est \u00e0 \u00e9viter. Si une entreprise peut, sans en subir de contrainte excessive, offrir des horaires de travail variables ou assouplir la t\u00e2che de l'employ\u00e9, ou m\u00eame proc\u00e9der \u00e0 autoriser des d\u00e9placements de personnel, permettant \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de fournir sa prestation de travail, l'employeur devra alors ainsi accommoder l'employ\u00e9. (au paragraphe 17.) (Voir aussi Johnstone c. Agence canadienne des services frontaliers, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 218.)\n[186] La Compagnie soutient que, si l'accommodement \u00e9tait exig\u00e9 en vertu de la LCDP, elle avait fourni un [TRADUCTION] accommodement raisonnable \u00e0 la plaignante pendant plus de quatre (4) mois pour qu'elle se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver, plut\u00f4t que le minimum de quinze (15) jours \u00e9tabli dans la convention collective. La Compagnie soutient aussi que le fait d'accorder l'indemnit\u00e9 demand\u00e9e par la plaignante constituerait une contrainte excessive parce que cela reviendrait \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s qui sont parents l'\u00e9quivalent d'une [TRADUCTION] super anciennet\u00e9 dans la convention collective, simplement en raison de leur statut de parents.\n[187] Je traiterai d'abord de l'argument au sujet de l' accommodement raisonnable.\n[188] La Compagnie soutient que le fait d'accorder du temps de plus \u00e0 la plaignante pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9tait tout ce qu'elle avait l'obligation de faire. Cependant, la preuve montre clairement que cela n'\u00e9tait pas du tout une r\u00e9ponse valable \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante ni au fondement factuel de sa situation, qu'elle avait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 son employeur dans ses diverses lettres. La preuve montre aussi que la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise sans qu'un repr\u00e9sentant de la Compagnie n'en discute avec la plaignante.\n[189] La preuve \u00e9tablit que la plaignante a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia et \u00e0 d'autres gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs de la Compagnie pour exposer les d\u00e9tails de sa situation de famille et son \u00e9valuation de la raison pour laquelle ses obligations et ses responsabilit\u00e9s envers sa famille l'emp\u00eachaient de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie. Elle a aussi express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 un cong\u00e9 de compassion. La plaignante a aussi clairement indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate et dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 tous les aspects de son emploi \u00e0 titre de chef de train \u00e0 Jasper, o\u00f9 elle avait le soutien n\u00e9cessaire pour prendre soin de ses enfants et de sa famille.\n[190] La preuve \u00e9tablit clairement que la Compagnie n'a pas fait preuve de compassion envers la situation de la plaignante. Elle n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses nombreuses demandes de mesures d'accommodement et personne n'a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante, ni n'a communiqu\u00e9 avec elle, pour discuter de sa situation, m\u00eame si la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie pr\u00e9voit que la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du processus doit \u00eatre une rencontre avec l'employ\u00e9. La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi clairement que Mme Storms et M. Torchia ne se sentaient pas responsables au sujet de questions relevant de la LCDP. Ils ont tous les deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur de l'employ\u00e9 et les responsables des ressources humaines sont les personnes aupr\u00e8s desquelles la question aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre soulev\u00e9e. Malheureusement, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, M. Pizziol, le superviseur de la plaignante, n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, et Mme Mary Jane Morrison, la personne responsable des ressources humaines \u00e0 Edmonton en 2005, ne l'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 non plus. Selon l'avocat de la Compagnie, M. Pizziol ne travaille plus pour la Compagnie et Mme Morrisson n'\u00e9tait pas disponible pour des raisons personnelles.\n[191] Il est clair que les t\u00e9moins de la Compagnie ne consid\u00e9raient pas la situation de famille - du moins les questions de situation de famille qui comprennent des obligations et des responsabilit\u00e9s parentales - comme un motif de discrimination qui n\u00e9cessitait une forme d'accommodement. Dans leur conception des divers motifs de discrimination \u00e9tablis dans la LCDP, il semble qu'ils ont choisi certains motifs qui, selon eux, donnent droit \u00e0 un accommodement, alors que d'autres n'y ouvrent pas droit. Par exemple, ils ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la Compagnie n'avait pas h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 accommoder des employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, mais qui ne pouvaient pas y aller en raison d'un parent malade. Ils ont aussi reconnu que la Compagnie, dans le pass\u00e9, avait accommod\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Cependant, sans chercher \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la nature de sa demande, ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation de la plaignante ne constituait pas une situation n\u00e9cessitant un accommodement en vertu de la LCDP.\n[192] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait au courant de la situation de la plaignante et qu'il en \u00e9tait venu \u00e0 la conclusion qu'elle avait besoin de plus de temps pour r\u00e9gler sa situation. Il n'a jamais discut\u00e9 avec la plaignante et n'a jamais d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 la question \u00e0 un autre gestionnaire, qui aurait pu discuter de la demande de la plaignante avec elle. Il \u00e9tait d'avis qu'il savait ce dont elle avait besoin et qu'il le lui avait donn\u00e9.\n[193] Quant \u00e0 Mme Storms, qui surveillait les feuilles de calcul du CGE, elle savait que la situation de la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9e de [TRADUCTION] question de garde d'enfants. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, elle a laiss\u00e9 entendre que de nombreux employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s avaient aussi soulev\u00e9 des questions de garde d'enfants et que cela devenait un th\u00e8me g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Cependant, pour aucun autre employ\u00e9, sauf la plaignante, Denise Seeley et Kasha Whyte, il n'y avait de mention garde d'enfants inscrite sur la feuille de calcul, et M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne connaissait aucun autre cas o\u00f9 la [TRADUCTION] question de garde d'enfants avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e.\n[194] Comme son service supervisait les renseignements au sujet des employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s, Mme Storms avait eu l'occasion d'avoir recours \u00e0 la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie dans le cas de la plaignante, mais elle ne l'avait pas fait. Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter que Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle avait pris des mesures d'accommodement dans le cas d'un autre employ\u00e9 qui avait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. Cet employ\u00e9 avait un parent en phase terminale et elle lui avait accord\u00e9 un cong\u00e9. Un examen des feuilles de calcul du CGE lui avait aussi permis d'apprendre que d'autres employ\u00e9s avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 exempt\u00e9s de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver en raison de maladie et pour d'autres raisons personnelles inexpliqu\u00e9es.\n[195] Dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 23 juin 2005, Mme Storms a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ses discussions t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques avec la plaignante et avec Mme Whyte. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que la plaignante avait des probl\u00e8mes quant \u00e0 la garde de ses enfants et que Mme Whyte avait un fils malade et qu'elle avait des probl\u00e8mes de garde. Elle a aussi mentionn\u00e9 dans le courriel que les deux employ\u00e9es avaient \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Torchia. Cependant, elle a aussi \u00e9crit que, si la plaignante et les deux autres femmes d\u00e9cidaient de ne pas se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie, leurs dossiers d'emploi seraient ferm\u00e9s et elles renonceraient \u00e0 leur anciennet\u00e9. Ce courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Gallegos et copi\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Nashman, \u00e0 M. Torchia, \u00e0 Kenneth Sherman et \u00e0 Brian Kalin (le superviseur de M. Pizziol). Aucun de ces gestionnaires n'a cru qu'il pouvait \u00eatre appropri\u00e9, compte tenu de la situation de la plaignante, d'avoir recours \u00e0 la politique d'accommodement.\n[196] La preuve d\u00e9montre aussi que la Compagnie n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 ses propres directives et politiques d'accommodement dans le cas de la plaignante. La Compagnie a une politique d'accommodement tr\u00e8s compl\u00e8te. Cette politique reconna\u00eet tous les motifs de distinction illicites \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP, y compris la situation de famille, et la politique indique clairement que, lorsque cela est possible, les politiques et les pratiques d'emploi doivent \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es afin qu'[TRADUCTION] aucune personne ne se voie refuser d'occasion d'emploi . Elle pr\u00e9cise aussi que l'accommodement [TRADUCTION] signifie le fait de d\u00e9ployer tous les efforts possibles pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins raisonnables des employ\u00e9s.\n[197] Les [TRADUCTION] directives d'accommodement de la Compagnie expliquent que l'objectif de la politique est [TRADUCTION] de garantir que les conditions de travail ne sont pas un obstacle \u00e0 l'emploi. Elles \u00e9tablissent aussi clairement que la Compagnie doit faire preuve de souplesse pour \u00e9liminer les obstacles et qu'elle devrait d\u00e9ployer [TRADUCTION] tous les efforts pour garantir que personne n'est d\u00e9savantag\u00e9 en raison d'une exigence ou d'un besoin sp\u00e9cial.\n[198] La politique d\u00e9finit aussi le processus \u00e0 suivre dans le cas d'une demande d'accommodement pour l'un des motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCDP et fournit une liste de v\u00e9rification que les gestionnaires et les superviseurs doivent suivre dans le cas d'une telle demande. La politique explique :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLa premi\u00e8re chose \u00e0 faire lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 signale un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial est de rencontrer cette personne. Permettez \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter le probl\u00e8me ou le besoin, posez lui des questions pour bien comprendre la demande et discutez ensemble de solutions possibles.\nSi aucune solution ne peut \u00eatre trouv\u00e9e de cette fa\u00e7on, ne rejetez pas la demande imm\u00e9diatement. Demandez des conseils, tentez d'obtenir d'autres solutions au probl\u00e8me et \u00e9valuez les r\u00e9percussions de tout accommodement possible aupr\u00e8s des personnes appropri\u00e9es, y compris le service du personnel, entre autres. L'employ\u00e9 a la responsabilit\u00e9 de participer activement au processus et de faciliter l'accommodement raisonnable. Les syndicats ont aussi un r\u00f4le et une responsabilit\u00e9 importants et reconnus dans l'accommodement des besoins des employ\u00e9s.\nIl est extr\u00eamement important de garder des dossiers de la r\u00e9union, des diverses solutions propos\u00e9es et des arguments utilis\u00e9s pour accepter ou rejeter chaque option. Ces renseignements sont indispensables en cas de plainte.\nAvisez rapidement la personne en question de la d\u00e9cision prise, en expliquant les raisons de la d\u00e9cision. Dans le cas du rejet d'une demande d'accommodement, l'employ\u00e9 peut avoir le droit de pr\u00e9senter un grief en fonction de la proc\u00e9dure de grief appropri\u00e9e ou de pr\u00e9senter une plainte en vertu de la LCDP.\n[199] Mme Ziemer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la politique vise \u00e0 effectuer une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de l'employ\u00e9, car chaque situation est diff\u00e9rente. Dans le cas de la plaignante, il est clair qu'aucune \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e.\n[200] La personne responsable de la politique d'accommodement au bureau d'Edmonton de la Compagnie est, comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mary-Jane Morrison, une agente des ressources humaines. C'est elle que consultent les personnes qui ont des questions au sujet de la politique ou de sa proc\u00e9dure. Mme Morrison n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience. La Compagnie a plut\u00f4t appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner Stephanie Ziemer, l'agente des ressources humaines \u00e0 Vancouver. Mme Ziemer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de ce qui, \u00e0 son avis, \u00e9tait couvert par la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que, de son point de vue \u00e0 titre de gestionnaire des ressources humaines, la situation de famille signifiait qu'un employeur ne peut pas agir de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers une personne qui a une famille, que ce soit un parent qui a des enfants ou toute personne qui est membre d'une famille. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] certainement, la situation de famille, de ce que j'en comprends ... ne comprendrait pas toute obligation individuelle parentale. Ces obligations sont tr\u00e8s individuelles, il s'agit de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences personnelles propres \u00e0 chaque individu et je n'ai certainement jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d'avis qu'elles relevaient de notre politique et qu'il fallait s'immiscer dans ces types de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales individuelles.\n[201] En contre interrogatoire, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Ziemer d'expliquer ce qu'elle voulait dire par [TRADUCTION] pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences parentales individuelles. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [TRADUCTION] La question de savoir si vous voulez \u00eatre \u00e0 la maison, par exemple, pour coucher votre enfant. La question de savoir si vous voulez assister \u00e0 chaque activit\u00e9 sportive de votre enfant. Je veux dire que ce sont l\u00e0 toutes des choses que nous aimerions faire \u00e0 titre de parents, mais qui ne sont pas suffisantes pour activer le processus d'accommodement. Elle a cependant ajout\u00e9 que le fait de prendre soin d'un enfant malade, d'avoir des probl\u00e8mes en raison d'une ordonnance de garde l\u00e9gale, ou d'\u00eatre parent seul sont des situations diff\u00e9rentes et peuvent ouvrir la porte \u00e0 la discussion. Elle a reconnu que la Compagnie s'attendait que les parents seuls, s'ils souhaitent \u00eatre cheminots, g\u00e8rent leur situation afin de s'acquitter de leurs obligations de travail. Cependant, elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que, si quelque chose d'inhabituel se produisait, par exemple, le fait de devoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 une p\u00e9nurie, cela pouvait aussi ouvrir la porte aux discussions.\n[202] Lorsque la porte est ouverte, le processus pr\u00e9voit qu'il doit y avoir une rencontre entre l'employ\u00e9 et son superviseur, afin que ce dernier puisse avoir une id\u00e9e du probl\u00e8me. Mme Ziemer a reconnu qu'un simple \u00e9change de lettres \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape ne serait pas efficace. Lors de la r\u00e9union, le superviseur devrait demander plus de renseignements au sujet des raisons de la demande et discuter des solutions possibles.\n[203] Mme Ziemer a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait pas particip\u00e9 directement au cas de la plaignante et qu'elle n'avait aucune connaissance personnelle \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que les ressources humaines n'interviennent pas toujours dans ces cas. Lorsque c'est possible, les questions sont r\u00e9solues au niveau local. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait suffisamment form\u00e9 ses gestionnaires afin qu'ils aient les capacit\u00e9s de prendre de bonnes d\u00e9cisions de gestion, de prot\u00e9ger les op\u00e9rations et d'effectuer, lorsque n\u00e9cessaire, de petites adaptations ou modifications aux conditions d'emploi de l'employ\u00e9.\n[204] Mme Ziemer a donn\u00e9 divers exemples de situations lors desquelles la Compagnie avait accommod\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s en raison de leur situation de famille, en commen\u00e7ant par sa propre situation. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que son mari avait \u00e9t\u00e9 gravement bless\u00e9 dans un accident de ski. Pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix semaines, il ne pouvait pas bouger son bras ni le haut de son corps. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'on lui avait permis de ne pas voyager et qu'on lui avait donn\u00e9 un horaire de travail souple. Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des accommodements accord\u00e9s \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver afin qu'il puisse \u00eatre disponible pour son fils qui avait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s ill\u00e9gales, y compris des activit\u00e9s li\u00e9es aux gangs, et \u00e0 un chef de train dont la fille avait subi un important effondrement psychologique. On avait permis \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 de travailler plus pr\u00e8s de la maison pendant une assez longue p\u00e9riode. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la Compagnie avait aussi pris des mesures d'accommodement pour un gestionnaire de march\u00e9 \u00e0 son retour d'un cong\u00e9 parental parce que son enfant souffrait d'un trouble de l'alimentation grave. On a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 cet employ\u00e9 du temps de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire apr\u00e8s la fin de son cong\u00e9 parental.\n[205] Lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre interrog\u00e9e par l'avocat de la CCDP, on a rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Ziemer deux autres exemples qu'elle avait mentionn\u00e9s lors de l'audience dans l'affaire Seeley. L'un de ces exemples \u00e9tait une mesure d'accommodement prise pour un employ\u00e9 qui lui permettait d'\u00eatre absent du tableau de service chaque deux semaines, parce qu'il n'avait des droits de visite que pendant 48 heures, la fin de semaine, chaque deux semaines. L'autre exemple portait sur un accommodement accord\u00e9 \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui prenait part \u00e0 une longue bataille pour la garde de ses enfants devant la Cour. On a accord\u00e9 du temps de cong\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 cette personne pour cette raison.\n[206] Elle a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la plupart de ces cas avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s au niveau local. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que les superviseurs sont form\u00e9s pour r\u00e9agir \u00e0 ce type de demande. Cependant, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 [TRADUCTION] malheureusement, nous ne pouvons pas superviser ce qu'ils font sur place en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'application de la formation r\u00e9elle qu'ils ont re\u00e7ue. Nous aimons croire qu'ils sont tous bien au courant de nos politiques, qu'ils sont bien form\u00e9s. Cependant, pour ce qui est de la question de savoir si le superviseur A au lieu B r\u00e9agirait \u00e0 une question qui est soulev\u00e9e, je ne peux pas affirmer que cela serait le cas.\n[207] Selon Mme Ziemer, bien qu'il n'y ait aucun m\u00e9canisme pour l'\u00e9valuation de l'application de la politique, la Compagnie s'attend \u00e0 ce que ses superviseurs de premi\u00e8re ligne fassent la bonne chose en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la politique, qu'ils la respectent et qu'ils se conforment \u00e0 ses subtilit\u00e9s. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, lorsqu'on ne respecte pas la politique, les ressources humaines sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement mises au courant par lettre ou inform\u00e9es par leurs homologues du c\u00f4t\u00e9 des relations de travail. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la Compagnie fonctionne selon la notion que ses superviseurs suivent la politique en fonction de ce qu'on leur a appris et des attentes de la Compagnie.\n[208] Mme Ziemer a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9, en contre interrogatoire, que le processus d\u00e9crit dans la politique d'accommodement d\u00e9bute d\u00e8s qu'un employ\u00e9 se pr\u00e9sente et fait \u00e9tat d'un probl\u00e8me ou d'un besoin sp\u00e9cial, bien qu'elle ait ajout\u00e9 que cela n'entra\u00eene pas n\u00e9cessairement une d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si l'accommodement est n\u00e9cessaire. L'avocate de la plaignante lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi ce processus n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9 dans le cas de la plaignante et elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'elle ne savait pas, parce qu'elle n'avait pas pris part \u00e0 l'affaire. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, l'employ\u00e9 communique avec son superviseur imm\u00e9diat en premier lieu.\n[209] M. Torchia a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il n'avait pas rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante parce que cela \u00e9tait normalement fait par le superviseur. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas [TRADUCTION] certain si le superviseur de la plaignante l'avait rencontr\u00e9e, mais qu'il [TRADUCTION] s'attendait \u00e0 ce qu'il l'ait fait parce qu'il avait eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le superviseur et que ce dernier \u00e9tait au courant de la situation.\n[210] En contre interrogatoire, il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il avait re\u00e7u une formation au sujet de l'obligation d'accommoder [TRADUCTION] il y a de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 90. Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle ne se souvient pas avoir re\u00e7u de formation au sujet de la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait au courant de la politique et que, si elle avait des questions \u00e0 ce sujet, elle communiquerait avec quelqu'un aux ressources humaines. Mme Storms a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais r\u00e9ellement utilis\u00e9 la politique d'accommodement, parce que le CGE ne re\u00e7oit pas beaucoup de demandes d'accommodement. Elle a cependant reconnu qu'il y avait eu des cas o\u00f9 le CGE avait pris des mesures d'accommodement pour des employ\u00e9s en raison d'une maladie grave dans la famille de l'employ\u00e9 ou parce qu'un employ\u00e9 avait besoin d'un cong\u00e9 pour des raisons personnelles.\n[211] Elle aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, bien qu'elle se souvienne avoir lu la politique, elle ne la connaissait pas bien et qu'elle n'avait pas de connaissances d\u00e9taill\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle ne savait pas si un autre employ\u00e9 du CGE avait re\u00e7u une formation sur la politique. Lorsque l'avocat de la CCDP l'a contre interrog\u00e9e, elle a r\u00e9pondu qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance, aucun des r\u00e9partiteurs ou des membres du Groupe de rajustement des tableaux, qui \u00e9taient principalement charg\u00e9s de communiquer avec les employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver, n'avaient eu de formation au sujet de la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie. Lorsqu'on lui a demand\u00e9 d'expliquer comment elle reconna\u00eetrait une question d'accommodement si on lui en pr\u00e9sentait une, Mme Storms a r\u00e9pondu que les employ\u00e9s du CGE savaient que la Compagnie prenait des mesures d'accommodement pour des employ\u00e9s et que, parfois, ils \u00e9taient au courant de la situation de l'employ\u00e9. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les employ\u00e9s du CGE renvoient au superviseur un employ\u00e9 qui a fait une demande sp\u00e9ciale.\n[212] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la plaignante, dans sa situation, la politique d'accommodement de la Compagnie n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle n'avait jamais eu de r\u00e9union avec son superviseur, le coordonnateur des trains \u00e0 Jasper, et qu'elle n'avait jamais re\u00e7u de r\u00e9ponse aux lettres qu'elle avait envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 ses superviseurs ou aux gestionnaires de la Compagnie dans lesquelles elle expliquait sa situation. Rien ne donnait non plus \u00e0 penser qu'elle avait eu une r\u00e9union avec quelqu'un des ressources humaines ou qu'on l'avait aiguill\u00e9e vers une telle personne. La preuve montre clairement que la Compagnie n'a pas respect\u00e9 les proc\u00e9dures \u00e9tablies dans sa propre politique et qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la situation de famille, du moins en ce qui a trait aux obligations et aux responsabilit\u00e9s parentales, n'\u00e9tait pas un motif de discrimination pour lequel des mesures d'accommodement \u00e9taient requises. Il est aussi clair que la Compagnie n'a jamais effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de la plaignante, comme elle devait le faire.\n[213] Dans sa lettre \u00e0 M. Torchia, la plaignante a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'accommodement possible qu'on lui accorde un cong\u00e9 de compassion pour la dur\u00e9e de la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. La preuve montre, en fonction du retour \u00e0 Jasper d'un autre employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, que ce retour aurait lieu vers mars 2006. Si le cong\u00e9 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9, la plaignante n'aurait pas travaill\u00e9 pour la Compagnie et elle n'aurait pas gagn\u00e9 de salaire. La Compagnie n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve permettant d'\u00e9tablir de quelle fa\u00e7on le fait d'accorder un cong\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante lui aurait caus\u00e9 une contrainte excessive.\n[214] M\u00eame si j'acceptais la preuve selon laquelle la Compagnie avait pris certaines mesures d' accommodement en accordant \u00e0 la plaignante plus de temps pour se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver, le d\u00e9faut de la Compagnie de satisfaire \u00e0 ses obligations proc\u00e9durales d\u00e9coulant du devoir d'accommodement aurait en soi constitu\u00e9 une violation des droits de la personne de la plaignante. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a reconnu que tant le processus de d\u00e9cision que la d\u00e9cision finale doivent \u00eatre examin\u00e9s lorsqu'on analyse une EPJ. Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 66 : il peut souvent se r\u00e9v\u00e9ler utile, en pratique, d'examiner s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, d'abord, la proc\u00e9dure, s'il en est, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour \u00e9tudier la question de l'accommodement, et, ensuite, la teneur r\u00e9elle d'une norme plus conciliante qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte ou, subsidiairement, celle des raisons pour lesquelles l'employeur n'a pas offert une telle norme. (Voir aussi Oak Bay Marina Ltd. c. British Columbia (Human Rights Tribunal) (no 2), 2004 BCHRT 225, aux paragraphes 84 \u00e0 86).\n[215] Dans la d\u00e9cision Lane c. ADGA Group Consultant Inc., 2007 HRTO 34, au paragraphe 150, (d\u00e9cision maintenue par la Cour sup\u00e9rieure de justice de l'Ontario, Cour divisionnaire, \u00e0 [2008] O.J. no 3076, 91 O.R.(3d) 649), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que :\n[TRADUCTION]\n... Le d\u00e9faut de respecter la dimension proc\u00e9durale de l'obligation d'accommodement est une forme de discrimination. Elle prive la personne touch\u00e9e des avantages de ce que la loi exige : la reconnaissance de l'obligation de ne pas faire preuve de discrimination et d'agir d'une telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 garantir qu'aucune discrimination n'a lieu.\n[216] Dans l'arr\u00eat Meiorin, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les questions suivantes sont pertinentes quant \u00e0 l'analyse de la portion proc\u00e9durale du processus d'accommodement suivi par l'employeur :\nL'employeur a-t-il cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 trouver des m\u00e9thodes de rechange qui n'ont pas d'effet discriminatoire, comme les \u00e9valuations individuelles en fonction d'une norme qui tient davantage compte de l'individu? Si des normes diff\u00e9rentes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9es et jug\u00e9es susceptibles de r\u00e9aliser l'objet vis\u00e9 par l'employeur, pourquoi n'ont-elles pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9es? Est-il n\u00e9cessaire que tous les employ\u00e9s satisfassent \u00e0 la norme unique pour que l'employeur puisse r\u00e9aliser l'objet l\u00e9gitime qu'il vise, ou est-il possible d'\u00e9tablir des normes qui refl\u00e8tent les diff\u00e9rences et les capacit\u00e9s collectives ou individuelles? Y a-t-il une mani\u00e8re moins discriminatoire d'effectuer le travail tout en r\u00e9alisant l'objet l\u00e9gitime de l'employeur? La norme est-elle bien con\u00e7ue pour que le niveau de comp\u00e9tence requis soit atteint sans qu'un fardeau excessif ne soit impos\u00e9 \u00e0 ceux qui sont vis\u00e9s par la norme? Les autres parties qui sont tenues d'aider \u00e0 la recherche de mesures d'accommodement possibles ont-elles jou\u00e9 leur r\u00f4le?\n[217] Pour satisfaire \u00e0 la composante proc\u00e9durale de l'obligation d'accommodement, la Compagnie a l'obligation de d\u00e9montrer qu'elle a examin\u00e9 et a raisonnablement rejet\u00e9 tout accommodement qui aurait r\u00e9pondu aux besoins de la plaignante.\n[218] La seule preuve qu'une \u00e9valuation d'autres formes d'accommodement ait pu se produire est la preuve que le Syndicat a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9e de solliciter les employ\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper pour voir si certains d'entre eux se porteraient volontaires pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 la place de la plaignante, de Kasha Whyte et de Denise Seeley. Cependant, comme personne ne s'est port\u00e9 volontaire, la sollicitation s'est arr\u00eat\u00e9e. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que la Compagnie a effectu\u00e9 une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e de la situation de la plaignante ou a examin\u00e9 d'autres mesures d'accommodement.\n[219] J'examinerai maintenant la position de la Compagnie au sujet du fait qu'il s'agirait d'une contrainte excessive si l'on accordait \u00e0 la plaignante le redressement qu'elle demande, parce qu'elle obtiendrait alors une super anciennet\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le simple fait qu'elle est m\u00e8re.\n[220] Selon Stephanie Ziemer, la Compagnie ne garde pas de renseignements au sujet du nombre de ses employ\u00e9s qui ont des enfants. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la seule fa\u00e7on d'obtenir ces renseignements serait d'examiner le dossier de chaque employ\u00e9 pour voir le nom des personnes que les employ\u00e9s ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es \u00e0 leur charge. Mme Ziemer a aussi ajout\u00e9 que selon le r\u00e9gime de prestations d'assurance de groupe des employ\u00e9s de la Compagnie [TRADUCTION] nous pouvons d\u00e9duire qu'environ 69 p. 100 de l'effectif [de la Compagnie] ont des enfants. La m\u00e9thodologie utilis\u00e9e par la Compagnie pour produire cette preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9prouv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience par l'avocate de la plaignante. Cependant, sans compter les probl\u00e8mes de m\u00e9thodologie, le Tribunal conclut que cette preuve partiale est tout \u00e0 fait insuffisante par rapport \u00e0 la preuve que la Compagnie devrait produire pour justifier l'acte discriminatoire, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, en fonction du crit\u00e8re de l'EPJ en trois parties de l'arr\u00eat Meiorin.\n[221] Si le Tribunal acceptait l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel, en raison du fait que la grande majorit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s ont des enfants, le fait d'accommoder la plaignante lui causerait des contraintes excessives, cela signifierait que tout environnement de travail o\u00f9 un grand nombre de personnes font partie d'un groupe qui poss\u00e8de l'une des caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles \u00e9tablies \u00e0 l'article 3 de la LCDP serait automatiquement exempt\u00e9 de l'application de la loi. Par exemple, cela signifie que des femmes qui travaillent dans un milieu o\u00f9 la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s sont des femmes ne pourraient pas pr\u00e9senter une plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Le fait d'accepter l'argument de la Compagnie aurait l'effet de rendre impossible la pr\u00e9sentation d'une plainte fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la situation de famille - du moins, les questions de situation de famille qui comprennent les obligations et les responsabilit\u00e9s parentales - parce que la majorit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s dans l'effectif ont des enfants et pourraient aussi suivre la m\u00eame route.\n[222] La Compagnie n'a produit aucune preuve permettant de conclure qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inond\u00e9e de demandes d'accommodement de la part de personnes dans la m\u00eame situation que la plaignante. Dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 41, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a clairement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que dans le contexte de l'accommodement la preuve, constitu\u00e9e d'impressions, d'une augmentation des d\u00e9penses ne suffit pas g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement. Dans la d\u00e9cision Lane, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 117, la Cour divisionnaire de l'Ontario a ajout\u00e9 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nOn ne peut pas \u00e9tablir une contrainte excessive en se fondant sur une preuve constitu\u00e9e d'impressions ou d'anecdotes, ou de justifications apr\u00e8s le fait. Les contraintes anticip\u00e9es caus\u00e9es par une proposition d'accommodement ne devraient pas \u00eatre maintenues si elles ne sont fond\u00e9es que sur des pr\u00e9occupations hypoth\u00e9tiques ou non corrobor\u00e9es que certaines cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives pourraient s'ensuivre si des mesures d'accommodement sont prises pour le plaignant.\n[223] Peu importe le fondement particulier de l'argument de la Compagnie selon lequel elle subira des contraintes excessives, il est bien \u00e9tabli que l'analyse des contraintes excessives doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans le contexte d'une demande d'accommodement individuelle. Comme la Cour supr\u00eame l'a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Grismer, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 19, l'accommodement doit \u00eatre incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 la norme m\u00eame afin de garantir que chaque personne est \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction de ses propres habilet\u00e9s personnelles, plut\u00f4t que d'\u00eatre jug\u00e9e en fonction de caract\u00e9ristiques de groupe pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es, qui sont souvent fond\u00e9es sur un parti pris et des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'\u00e9valuation individuelle d'un employ\u00e9 est une \u00e9tape essentielle dans le processus d'accommodement, \u00e0 moins que cette \u00e9valuation en elle m\u00eame constitue une contrainte excessive pour l'intim\u00e9e (voir Grismer, aux paragraphes 22, 30, 32 et 38; Meiorin, au paragraphe 65; Audet c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2006 TCDP 25, au paragraphe 61 et Knight c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des transports de l'Outaouais, 2007 TCDP 15, au paragraphe 72). Une fois de plus, cette \u00e9valuation individuelle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e dans le cas de la plaignante.\n[224] En l'esp\u00e8ce, la Compagnie n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve voulant que le fait de prendre des mesures d'accommodement pour la plaignante lui causerait une contrainte excessive en ce qui a trait aux co\u00fbts. La seule preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet des co\u00fbts portait sur la formation des chefs de train et il n'y a eu aucune tentative de lier cette preuve \u00e0 la situation en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il faut se souvenir que, pour que les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accommodement soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s excessifs, ils doivent \u00eatre importants. Dans la d\u00e9cision Quesnel c. London Educational Health Centre (1995), 28 C.H.R.R. D\/474 (Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 59 : [TRADUCTION] les co\u00fbts constituent une contrainte excessive seulement s'ils changent la nature essentielle de l'entreprise responsable de l'accommodement ou en changent de fa\u00e7on importante la viabilit\u00e9. La Compagnie a reconnu ce fait dans sa propre politique d'accommodement, qui pr\u00e9cise : [TRADUCTION] Les co\u00fbts encourus doivent \u00eatre extr\u00eamement \u00e9lev\u00e9s avant que le refus d'accommodement puisse \u00eatre justifi\u00e9. Le fardeau de justifier le refus revient \u00e0 l'employeur. Les co\u00fbts doivent \u00eatre quantifiables et doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 l'accommodement. Les r\u00e9novations ou l'\u00e9quipement sp\u00e9cial peuvent \u00eatre dispendieux, mais il est parfois possible d'obtenir une aide financi\u00e8re de diverses organisations. Aucune preuve de ce genre n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\ne) Conclusion [225] Pour tous les motifs pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, le Tribunal conclut que la preuve a \u00e9tabli que la Compagnie a viol\u00e9 les articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. La pratique de la Compagnie d'exiger que la plaignante se pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 Vancouver pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur elle en raison de sa situation de famille. La preuve d\u00e9montre que la Compagnie a agi en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la LDCP en usant de politiques et de pratiques qui ont priv\u00e9 la plaignante d'occasions d'emploi, en raison de sa situation de famille.\n[226] La preuve \u00e9tablit aussi que la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9savantag\u00e9e en raison de ses besoins sp\u00e9ciaux et de ses exigences. Les gestionnaires de la Compagnie ne l'ont jamais rencontr\u00e9e. Ils ne lui ont jamais donn\u00e9 l'occasion de pr\u00e9senter et d'expliquer ses besoins et ils ne lui ont pas pos\u00e9 de questions pour mieux comprendre sa demande. Ils n'ont jamais demand\u00e9 l'avis de leur propre service des ressources humaines. S'ils l'avaient fait, on leur aurait certainement recommand\u00e9 de d\u00e9clencher la politique, compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Ziemer selon laquelle la politique est utilis\u00e9e d\u00e8s qu'un employ\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial, et compte tenu de son t\u00e9moignage au sujet du fait que d'avoir \u00e0 prendre soin d'un enfant malade, d'avoir des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet d'une ordonnance de garde ou d'\u00eatre un parent seul ouvrirait du moins la porte aux discussions.\nD. REDRESSEMENTS [227] La plaignante demande les redressements suivants : une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire et d'avantages sociaux, une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, les d\u00e9pens et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ainsi qu'une ordonnance la r\u00e9tablissant dans son poste \u00e0 la Compagnie avec sa pleine anciennet\u00e9, ses avantages sociaux et toutes les autres occasions ou tous les autres privil\u00e8ges dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e. La CCDP demande aussi une ordonnance selon laquelle la Compagnie doit cesser tout comportement ou toute pratique discriminatoires et doit r\u00e9viser sa politique d'accommodement.\n(i) Une ordonnance visant \u00e0 ce que la Compagnie r\u00e9vise sa politique d'accommodement [228] La CCDP demande une ordonnance, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP, pour que la Compagnie prenne des mesures, en consultation avec la CCDP, afin de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 son d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d'accommodement appropri\u00e9es pour ses employ\u00e9s en raison de la situation de famille, y compris les questions d'obligations et de responsabilit\u00e9s parentales. Elle demande aussi une ordonnance pour qu'une formation appropri\u00e9e en droits de la personne soit mise en place pour les gestionnaires, les employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines et le personnel de gestion des \u00e9quipes de la Compagnie et que des s\u00e9ances d'information r\u00e9guli\u00e8res sur les politiques d'accommodement soient offertes afin d'\u00e9liminer les attitudes et les pr\u00e9somptions discriminatoires li\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation de famille \u00e0 titre de motif de discrimination.\n[229] Bien que le Tribunal reconnaisse que la Compagnie a une bonne politique d'accommodement, il est clair qu'elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e ou mise en uvre de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e dans les cas o\u00f9 la situation de famille constitue un motif de discrimination. Une partie de la preuve a aussi d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la politique n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9vis\u00e9e depuis les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal Audet c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, [2006] TCDP 25 et Hoyt, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e. Tout au plus, selon Cathy Smolynek, la directrice principale des services de sant\u00e9 au travail de la Compagnie, certains changements de processus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la question de la d\u00e9ficience dans la politique.\n[230] J'ai mentionn\u00e9 les directives en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement dans ma d\u00e9cision et j'ai conclu que les gestionnaires et les superviseurs n'ont pas respect\u00e9 la politique dans le cas de la plaignante. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la preuve, je conclus que la demande de la CCDP est justifi\u00e9e.\n[231] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de travailler en collaboration avec la Commission afin de garantir que la pratique et le comportement discriminatoires ne se poursuivent pas et de veiller \u00e0 ce que :\nles politiques, pratiques et proc\u00e9dures appropri\u00e9es sont en place la Compagnie, en collaboration avec la CCDP, embauche les personnes appropri\u00e9es pour donner une formation en milieu de travail aux gestionnaires, aux employ\u00e9s des ressources humaines, aux employ\u00e9s du CGE et \u00e0 tous les autres employ\u00e9s vis\u00e9s au sujet des questions de discrimination et de droits de la personne, et particuli\u00e8rement au sujet de l'accommodement pour le motif de la situation de famille.\n(ii) R\u00e9tablissement [232] La plaignante demande au Tribunal, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP, d'ordonner \u00e0 la Compagnie de la r\u00e9tablir dans son poste de chef de train au sein de la Compagnie. L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)b) de la LCDP pr\u00e9cise que, lorsque le Tribunal juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, il peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'accorder \u00e0 la victime, d\u00e8s que les circonstances le permettent, les droits, chances ou avantages dont l'acte discriminatoire l'a priv\u00e9e.\n[233] Pour que ce redressement soit appliqu\u00e9 en l'esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante doit donc \u00eatre r\u00e9tablie dans son poste sans perte d'anciennet\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie d'affecter la plaignante \u00e0 titre de chef de train au terminal de Jasper, apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait mis \u00e0 jour, au besoin, sa fiche de r\u00e8gles et sa fiche m\u00e9dicale.\n[234] Il y a trois dates de d\u00e9but possibles que le Tribunal pourrait utiliser pour r\u00e9tablir la plaignante. La premi\u00e8re date est celle du 2 juillet 2005, qui peut \u00eatre vue comme la date d'application de la demande de la plaignante d'\u00eatre accommod\u00e9e en \u00e9tant affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Jasper. Le Tribunal n'accepte pas cette date parce que rien ne prouve que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 un poste \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque ou que cela aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 une mesure d'accommodement appropri\u00e9e. Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que des employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque.\n[235] La deuxi\u00e8me date est celle du 1er mars 2006. Selon la preuve, il s'agit de la date \u00e0 laquelle un autre employ\u00e9 mis \u00e0 pied \u00e0 Jasper, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9 et s'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper. Comme seulement quatre employ\u00e9s de Jasper, la plaignante, Denise Seeley, Kasha Whyte et cet autre employ\u00e9, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver, il pourrait \u00eatre raisonnable de s'attendre que les quatre employ\u00e9s auraient aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s \u00e0 Jasper vers mars 2006. Mme Storms a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [TRADUCTION] comme l'anciennet\u00e9 de la plaignante est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s de celle [de l'autre employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9], on peut conclure qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper au m\u00eame moment.\n[236] Enfin, un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 selon lequel en mars 2007, la Compagnie a embauch\u00e9 de nouveaux chefs de train \u00e0 Jasper et qu'un grand nombre de ces nouveaux chefs de train ont depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est raisonnable de conclure que la plaignante avait, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, une priorit\u00e9 d'anciennet\u00e9 sur ces nouveaux chefs de train et qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper avant eux.\n[237] Compte tenu de l'aveu de Mme Storms, on peut conclure que la plaignante aurait probablement \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e en mars 2006 si elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, et cette date est donc celle retenue pour son r\u00e9tablissement.\n[238] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son anciennet\u00e9, comme l'anciennet\u00e9 continue m\u00eame lorsqu'un employ\u00e9 est en mise \u00e0 pied, elle continuera de s'accumuler comme s'il n'y avait jamais eu de rupture dans sa relation avec la Compagnie le 2 juillet 2005.\n(iii) Indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire [239] La plaignante demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour tout le salaire et les avantages qu'elle a perdus, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP. Compte tenu de ma conclusion au sujet de la date de r\u00e9tablissement, j'ordonne que la plaignante soit indemnis\u00e9e pour toute perte de salaire et d'avantages \u00e0 partir du 1er mars 2006 jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. J'ordonne aux parties de calculer le montant du salaire en fonction de la formule pr\u00e9vue dans la convention collective. En ce qui a trait aux paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qu'un chef de train peut recevoir, comme il serait difficile pour le Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir un montant, le Tribunal ordonne aux parties qu'elles \u00e9tablissent ce montant en examinant les montants suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s pendant cette p\u00e9riode \u00e0 un conducteur travaillant dans le terminal qui aurait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable, en supposant que le chef de train n'avait pas d'absences inhabituelles. Par exemple, les parties pourraient tenir compte des paiements suppl\u00e9mentaires qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Jasper en mars 2006.\n[240] En 2006, le salaire de la plaignante \u00e9tait de 18 233,96 $. Pendant cette p\u00e9riode, la plaignante occupait deux emplois, un emploi de serveuse et un autre dans un centre de r\u00e9novation. En 2007, elle a obtenu une promotion au poste de g\u00e9rante adjointe au centre de r\u00e9novation et son salaire \u00e9tait alors de 33 172,58 $. En 2008, elle occupait le m\u00eame poste avec un salaire de 37 365,44 $. En juillet 2009, elle a obtenu une autre promotion au poste de g\u00e9rante. Depuis juillet, elle gagne 17 $ de l'heure et elle travaille 40 heures par semaine. Pendant les premiers mois de 2009, elle gagnait 15,50 $. Elle n'a re\u00e7u aucun autre avantage dans cet emploi.\n[241] Par mesure d'att\u00e9nuation, ces montants devraient donc \u00eatre d\u00e9duits du montant de la perte de salaire.\n[242] Quand \u00e0 la demande pour la perte de salaire du 2 juillet 2005 au 1er mars 2006, la preuve ne permettait pas de conclure que la plaignante aurait travaill\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode. M\u00eame si on lui avait permis de rester au tableau des urgences, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e qui permettrait au Tribunal d'\u00e9tablir un montant, alors le Tribunal ne rend aucune ordonnance pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n(iv) Pr\u00e9judice moral [243] Le paragraphe 53(2) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral que la victime a subi en raison de la pratique discriminatoire, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $.\n[244] La plaignante a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'entre le moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver et la date \u00e0 laquelle elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, la situation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficile pour elle, parce qu'elle croyait sinc\u00e8rement que tout allait \u00eatre r\u00e9solu. Cependant, apr\u00e8s son cong\u00e9diement, la vie a \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile pour elle et ses enfants parce qu'elle ne savait pas ce qui allait se passer. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier l'avait beaucoup affect\u00e9e. Elle avait cru qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s d'\u00eatre affect\u00e9e et que maintenant, cette occasion avait disparu. Elle a d\u00e9crit la d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier comme \u00e9tant une [TRADUCTION] situation qui [l]'avait totalement d\u00e9pass\u00e9e et un [TRADUCTION] dur coup pour les finances et la famille. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en [TRADUCTION] d\u00e9ni et qu'elle [TRADUCTION] ne croyait pas que c'\u00e9tait possible. Elle s'est [TRADUCTION] sentie rejet\u00e9e comme lorsqu'on perd un \u00e9poux, un partenaire.\n[245] Bien qu'aucune preuve m\u00e9dicale n'e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 produite \u00e0 l'audience, le Tribunal conclut que le comportement et l'attitude nonchalante de la Compagnie envers la situation de la plaignante l'ont boulevers\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de payer \u00e0 la plaignante 15 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\n(v) Acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 [246] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire lorsque la pratique discriminatoire de l'intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e, jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $.\n[247] La Compagnie poss\u00e8de une politique d'accommodement, qui \u00e9tablit les proc\u00e9dures \u00e0 suivre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 qui signale un probl\u00e8me ou un besoin sp\u00e9cial. Cette politique a clairement cibl\u00e9 la situation de famille comme motif de discrimination. Pourtant, la Compagnie et les gestionnaires sup\u00e9rieurs qui ont agi dans cette affaire ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu'ils n'avaient pas \u00e0 se pr\u00e9occuper de la situation de famille et n'ont pas tenu compte de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s pr\u00e9vues par la politique. Ils n'ont fait aucun effort pour essayer de comprendre la situation de la plaignante. Ils n'ont pas tenu compte de ses lettres et ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter son cas comme \u00e9tant simplement un cas de [TRADUCTION] probl\u00e8me de garde d'enfants. Ils \u00e9taient d'avis qu'ils savaient, sans avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante, ce qui \u00e9tait mieux pour elle et ce dont elle avait besoin. Ces actes, \u00e0 mon avis, \u00e9taient inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[248] Compte tenu des circonstances, j'ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de payer \u00e0 la plaignante la somme de 20 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi.\n(vi) Indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses [249] Dans ses conclusions finales, l'avocate de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 que le Tribunal accorde les d\u00e9pens. La question de savoir si le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des d\u00e9pens et si cette comp\u00e9tence rel\u00e8ve de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, qui autorise le Tribunal \u00e0 indemniser un plaignant pour toutes les d\u00e9penses encourues en raison de l'acte discriminatoire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2009 CAF 309, d\u00e9cision qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue dans les derniers jours de l'audience.\n[250] Apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 le Code des droits de la personne de diverses provinces, qui permettait d'accorder des d\u00e9pens, et apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu au paragraphe 95 :\nLa recherche vise \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le l\u00e9gislateur voulait investir le Tribunal du pouvoir d'accorder des d\u00e9pens au plaignant ayant gain de cause. Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci dessus, je conclus que le l\u00e9gislateur n'avait pas l'intention d'investir, et n'a pas investi, le Tribunal du pouvoir d'accorder des d\u00e9pens. Conclure que le Tribunal peut accorder des d\u00e9pens au titre des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte aurait pour effet d'introduire indirectement dans la Loi un pouvoir qui ne correspondait pas \u00e0 l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur.\n[251] Tenant compte de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, le Tribunal ne peut pas accueillir la demande de la plaignante quant \u00e0 l'ordonnance que la Compagnie lui paie ses d\u00e9pens.\n[252] La plaignante et Kasha Whyte ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des menues d\u00e9penses d'un montant de 336,68 $, chacune des plaignantes demandant la moiti\u00e9 de ce montant. En application de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 la Compagnie de rembourser la moiti\u00e9 du montant \u00e0 la plaignante.\n(vii) Int\u00e9r\u00eats [253] En ce qui a trait aux int\u00e9r\u00eats, ils sont exigibles pour toutes les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP). Il s'agit d'int\u00e9r\u00eats simples calcul\u00e9s annuellement, \u00e0 un taux \u00e9quivalant au taux d'escompte (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle) \u00e9tabli par la Banque du Canada. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP) et \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3)), les int\u00e9r\u00eats commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date de la plainte, et pour la perte de salaire, ils commenceront \u00e0 courir \u00e0 partir de la date de r\u00e9tablissement.\nSign\u00e9e par Michel Doucet OTTAWA (Ontario) Le 29 septembre 2010\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1356\/8608\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nCindy Richards c.

Lustig\n[1] Il s'agit d'une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant pour que le Tribunal suspende sa d\u00e9cision au sujet des d\u00e9pens jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada rende sa d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. (Dossier no 33507.)\n[2] Le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 11 janvier 2007. Il soutenait que l'intim\u00e9e avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en mettant fin \u00e0 son emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience physique, en contravention de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d'instruire la plainte, en application de l'alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 26 avril 2008.\n[4] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dat\u00e9 du 1er avril 2009, le plaignant a invoqu\u00e9 divers paragraphes de l'article 53 de la LCDP au sujet des mesures de redressement et a demand\u00e9, entre autres, l'adjudication des d\u00e9pens.\n[5] J'ai tenu l'audience dans ce dossier du 15 au 19 juin 2009 et le 22 juin 2009. Dans ses conclusions finales \u00e0 l'audience, Mme Raymond, l'avocate du plaignant, n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation au sujet de la question des d\u00e9pens.\n[6] Le 26 octobre 2009, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (PG) c. Mowat, 2009 CAF 309 (Mowat), que [...] le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour adjuger des d\u00e9pens aux termes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[7] J'ai rendu ma d\u00e9cision dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire le 27 janvier 2010. J'y ai conclu que la plainte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e et que l'intim\u00e9e avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire comme le plaignant l'all\u00e9guait.\n[8] Dans ma d\u00e9cision, j'ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e d'indemniser le plaignant pour pr\u00e9judice moral li\u00e9 \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP et d'indemniser le plaignant parce que la pratique discriminatoire \u00e9tait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e, au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Je n'ai pris aucune question en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[9] Aucune demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet de ma d\u00e9cision.\n[10] Le 1er mars 2010, la pr\u00e9sente demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Raymond, l'avocate du plaignant, dans une lettre au Tribunal. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la lettre, le directeur des activit\u00e9s du greffe a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Mme Raymond le 5 mars 2010, attirant son attention sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rendue le 26 octobre 2009 dans l'arr\u00eat Mowat, au sujet de la question des d\u00e9pens. Dans cette lettre, le Tribunal a invit\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites, y compris la jurisprudence, \u00e0 l'appui de sa demande. L'avocat de l'intim\u00e9e a aussi re\u00e7u une copie de la lettre et a eu l'occasion de r\u00e9pondre par observations \u00e9crites, auxquelles le plaignant a pu r\u00e9pondre.\n[11] Le 22 avril 2010, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a accord\u00e9 l'autorisation de porter en appel la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Mowat.\n[12] Les observations du plaignant ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au Tribunal le 31 mai 2010. Les observations de l'intim\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es le 19 juillet 2010. La r\u00e9ponse du plaignant aux observations de l'intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Tribunal au moyen d'une lettre dat\u00e9e du 6 ao\u00fbt 2010.\n[13] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les observations du plaignant sont les suivantes :\nLe Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne a le pouvoir d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens au plaignant qui obtient gain de cause, en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, qui pr\u00e9voit :\n53 (2) \u00c0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l'article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire :\nc) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9, ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire et des d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte.\nDe nombreuses fois, dans la majorit\u00e9 des autorit\u00e9s canadiennes, les tribunaux et les cours ont inclus les d\u00e9pens dans l'expression des d\u00e9penses.\nLa d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Mowat est une interpr\u00e9tation restreinte de cet article de la LCDP et cr\u00e9e un obstacle qui pourrait compromettre l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice pour de nombreux plaignants. Cette interpr\u00e9tation restreinte de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) dans l'arr\u00eat Mowat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ne refl\u00e8te pas l'objet de la LCDP. En excluant les d\u00e9pens des d\u00e9penses, les membres les plus vuln\u00e9rables et les plus d\u00e9savantag\u00e9s de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne voient brim\u00e9 leur droit inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice. Vu l'importance de l'issue de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada d'accorder l'autorisation de porter la d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Mowat en appel, le plaignant demande au Tribunal de prendre en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 son jugement au sujet des d\u00e9pens jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'une d\u00e9cision soit rendue par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada. [14] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les observations de l'intim\u00e9e sont les suivantes :\nLe Tribunal est tenu de suivre les enseignements de l'arr\u00eat Mowat en fonction de la doctrine stare decisis et en fonction de sa propre comp\u00e9tence. Le Tribunal est functus officio. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, m\u00eame s'il existait maintenant une jurisprudence lui permettant d'adjuger les d\u00e9pens, qui n'existe pas, ne soutient pas n\u00e9cessairement une demande de d\u00e9pens parce que les deux parties ont partiellement eu gain de cause, le Tribunal ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas rendre d'ordonnance au sujet de certaines des mesures de redressement que le plaignant avait demand\u00e9es. La demande en l'esp\u00e8ce doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme une requ\u00eate en suspension d'instance. En l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune preuve ne permet de conclure qu'il est satisfait aux crit\u00e8res de la suspension d'instance, notamment le fait qu'aucune preuve ne donne \u00e0 penser qu'il y a eu dommages irr\u00e9parables ou qu'il existe une pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients en faveur du plaignant, et il n'y a aucun autre fondement permettant au Tribunal de tirer une telle conclusion.\n[15] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, les observations en r\u00e9ponse du plaignant sont les suivantes :\nLes circonstances en l'esp\u00e8ce sont sp\u00e9ciales, en raison de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada qui rend inop\u00e9rant le principe de stare decisis en l'esp\u00e8ce. Malgr\u00e9 le principe de functus officio, comme le plaignant a soulev\u00e9 la question des d\u00e9pens dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et que la question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour trancher la question puisque l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP lui en donne le pouvoir. Compte tenu du r\u00e9sultat de la d\u00e9cision, il est justifi\u00e9 d'accorder les d\u00e9pens. Le plaignant n'a pas demand\u00e9 une suspension d'instance. Il a plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 que, pour des raisons pratiques, la question soit prise en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la Cour supr\u00eame rende une d\u00e9cision dans l'affaire Mowat.\n[16] Lorsque j'ai rendu ma d\u00e9cision dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, j'ai examin\u00e9 les mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es par le plaignant. Je n'ai pris aucune question en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. J'ai conclu que j'\u00e9tais tenu de suivre la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Mowat, en fonction du principe l\u00e9gal fondamental de stare decisis - qui signifie s'en tenir aux d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendues. \u00c0 ce sujet, j'accepte les observations de l'intim\u00e9e, notamment les suivantes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe Tribunal est li\u00e9 par les principes selon lesquels il doit correctement interpr\u00e9ter et appliquer le droit se rapportant \u00e0 sa comp\u00e9tence.\nUn des m\u00e9canismes permettant d'atteindre cette certitude et la stabilit\u00e9 qui en d\u00e9coule est la doctrine stare decisis :\nLe juge de premi\u00e8re instance s'est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 bon droit li\u00e9 par la jurisprudence et je le suis \u00e9galement. Le stare decisis est la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale conf\u00e9rant un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de certitude et de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 au droit canadien ainsi qu'une certaine efficacit\u00e9 dans l'administration de notre syst\u00e8me de justice; il est aussi, en soi, l'un des principes fondamentaux de notre syst\u00e8me de justice (donc un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la justice fondamentale ).\nCanada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l'Immigration)\nc. Fast, 2001 CAF 373, paragraphe 2.\nEn n'adjugeant pas les d\u00e9pens en l'esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal exerce correctement sa comp\u00e9tence, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 et au principe de stare decisis.\n[17] Puisque j'ai rendu ma d\u00e9cision sans prendre d'\u00e9l\u00e9ment en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et que je suis li\u00e9, comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, par la jurisprudence qui existait (et qui existe toujours) au sujet des d\u00e9pens, je suis maintenant functus officio. Une fois de plus, \u00e0 ce sujet, j'accepte les observations de l'intim\u00e9e, notamment les suivantes :\n[TRADUCTION]\nLe prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision a mis fin \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en ce qui a trait aux questions qu'il devait trancher.\nComme le Tribunal a \u00e9puis\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence dans le dossier, il s'est acquitt\u00e9 de ses responsabilit\u00e9s l\u00e9gales par rapport \u00e0 la plainte. Il est functus officio.\nLa Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a expliqu\u00e9 le concept comme suit :\nFunctus Officio\nLa r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale portant qu'on ne saurait revenir sur une d\u00e9cision judiciaire d\u00e9finitive d\u00e9coule de la d\u00e9cision de la Court of Appeal d'Angleterre dans In re St. Nazaire Co. (1879), 12 Ch. D. 88. La cour y avait conclu que le pouvoir d'entendre \u00e0 nouveau une affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la division d'appel en vertu des Judicature Acts. La r\u00e8gle ne s'appliquait que si le jugement avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9, prononc\u00e9 et inscrit, et elle souffrait deux exceptions :\n1. lorsqu'il y avait eu lapsus en la r\u00e9digeant ou\n2. lorsqu'il y avait une erreur dans l'expression de l'intention manifeste de la cour. Voir Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J. O. Ross Engineering Corp., [1934] R.C.S. 186.\n[...]\nJe ne crois pas que le juge Martland ait voulu affirmer que le principe functus officio ne s'applique aucunement aux tribunaux administratifs. Si l'on fait abstraction de la pratique suivie en Angleterre, selon laquelle on doit h\u00e9siter \u00e0 modifier ou \u00e0 rouvrir des jugements officiels, la reconnaissance du caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des proc\u00e9dures devant les tribunaux administratifs se justifie par une bonne raison de principe. En r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, lorsqu'un tel tribunal a statu\u00e9 d\u00e9finitivement sur une question dont il \u00e9tait saisi conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 sa loi habilitante, il ne peut revenir sur sa d\u00e9cision simplement parce qu'il a chang\u00e9 d'avis, parce qu'il a commis une erreur dans le cadre de sa comp\u00e9tence, ou parce que les circonstances ont chang\u00e9. Il ne peut le faire que si la loi le lui permet ou s'il y a eu un lapsus ou une erreur au sens des exceptions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l'arr\u00eat Paper Machinery Ltd. v. J. O. Ross Engineering Corp., pr\u00e9cit\u00e9.\nLe principe du functus officio s'applique dans cette mesure. Cependant, il se fonde sur un motif de principe qui favorise le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des proc\u00e9dures plut\u00f4t que sur la r\u00e8gle \u00e9nonc\u00e9e relativement aux jugements officiels d'une cour de justice dont la d\u00e9cision peut faire l'objet d'un appel en bonne et due forme. C'est pourquoi j'estime que son application doit \u00eatre plus souple et moins formaliste dans le cas de d\u00e9cisions rendues par des tribunaux administratifs qui ne peuvent faire l'objet d'un appel que sur une question de droit. Il est possible que des proc\u00e9dures administratives doivent \u00eatre rouvertes, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice, afin d'offrir un redressement qu'il aurait par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'obtenir par voie d'appel.\nPar cons\u00e9quent, il ne faudrait pas appliquer le principe de fa\u00e7on stricte lorsque la loi habilitante porte \u00e0 croire qu'une d\u00e9cision peut \u00eatre rouverte afin de permettre au tribunal d'exercer la fonction que lui conf\u00e8re sa loi habilitante. C'\u00e9tait le cas dans l'affaire Grillas, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e.\nDe plus, si le tribunal administratif a omis de trancher une question qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 bon droit dans les proc\u00e9dures et qu'il a le pouvoir de trancher en vertu de sa loi habilitante, on devrait lui permettre de compl\u00e9ter la t\u00e2che que lui confie la loi. Cependant, si l'entit\u00e9 administrative est habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 trancher une question d'une ou de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons pr\u00e9cises ou par des modes subsidiaires de redressement, le fait d'avoir choisi une m\u00e9thode particuli\u00e8re ne lui permet pas de rouvrir les proc\u00e9dures pour faire un autre choix. Le tribunal ne peut se r\u00e9server le droit de le faire afin de maintenir sa comp\u00e9tence pour l'avenir, \u00e0 moins que la loi ne lui conf\u00e8re le pouvoir de rendre des d\u00e9cisions provisoires ou temporaires.

Introduction : [1] Le Tribunal est saisi d\u2019une question pr\u00e9liminaire soulev\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. (l\u2019intim\u00e9e), au sujet d\u2019une plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 10 janvier 2008 par Mme Heather Lynn Grant (la plaignante). L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en adjonction de Telecommunications Employees Association of Manitoba Inc. (TEAM ou le Syndicat) \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal.\n[2] La requ\u00eate est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la Loi) et le paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les R\u00e8gles).\n[3] Dans sa plainte, la plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en usant de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel, en refusant de prendre des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience et en la cong\u00e9diant en raison de cette d\u00e9ficience, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi.\n[4] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se r\u00e9sume comme suit :\nLa plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e exc\u00e9dentaire conform\u00e9ment aux stipulations de la convention collective sign\u00e9e par le Syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ; L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que l\u2019ajout du Syndicat comme intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019instruction est n\u00e9cessaire pour que le Tribunal puisse correctement trancher l\u2019affaire et, si n\u00e9cessaire, ordonner une mesure de r\u00e9paration efficace ; L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient aussi que, si le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination, le Syndicat et l\u2019intim\u00e9e sont conjointement responsables de l\u2019acte discriminatoire d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application de la convention collective et sont conjointement responsable de rectifier ladite convention.\n[5] Le 28 juin 2010, Mme Shirish P. Chotalia, c.r., la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate serait tranch\u00e9e sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites. La soussign\u00e9e fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour statuer sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nII. Analyse : [6] La Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas de proc\u00e9dure comme telle pour l\u2019adjonction forc\u00e9e de parties et d\u2019intervenants dans une instance devant le Tribunal. Tout au plus, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 48.9(2)b) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit :\nLe pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal peut \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles de pratique r\u00e9gissant, notamment : [\u2026]\nb) l\u2019adjonction de parties ou d\u2019intervenants \u00e0 l\u2019affaire ;\n[...]\n[7] Avant 2004, le pr\u00e9sident n\u2019avait \u00e9dict\u00e9 aucune r\u00e8gle au sujet de l\u2019adjonction de parties, avec ou sans leur consentement, et il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clair si le Tribunal avait la comp\u00e9tence de le faire.\n[8] Je suis d\u2019avis que les motifs suivants, rendus dans les d\u00e9cisions Desormeaux c. OC Transpo (T701\/0602) et Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d'ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone section locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus communications (Qu\u00e9bec) inc., 2003 TCDP 31 (Telus), sont instructifs :\n[23] Dans une d\u00e9cision rendue sur le banc le 2 octobre 2002 dans la cause de Desormeaux c. OC Transport (T701\/0602), la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, qui \u00e9tait saisie d'une demande d'adjonction d'un syndicat comme intim\u00e9, statua qu'en vertu de l'article 50 de la Loi, le Tribunal a le pouvoir d'ajouter des individus ou des groupes comme parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans le cadre d'une instruction. (Nous soulignons.) Toutefois, elle fit remarquer qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, telle n'\u00e9tait pas la question qui se posait \u00e0 elle, la question \u00e0 trancher \u00e9tant plut\u00f4t de savoir si une tierce partie (partie \u00e9trang\u00e8re \u00e0 la plainte) pouvait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9 avec les cons\u00e9quences que cela pouvait avoir au niveau de sa responsabilit\u00e9.\n[9] Sur ce point, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal a conclu, s'appuyant en cela sur l'article 48.9 (2)b) de la Loi, que l'intention du l\u00e9gislateur \u00e9tait de conf\u00e9rer au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ajouter tant des parties que des intervenants \u00e0 une instance devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que le Tribunal avait comp\u00e9tence. Ce qu\u2019il restait \u00e0 trancher \u00e9tait la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait appropri\u00e9 d\u2019ajouter un intim\u00e9 dans les circonstances.\n[10] Par ailleurs, dans une d\u00e9cision subs\u00e9quente rendue \u00e0 l\u2019audience le 3 octobre 2002 dans la m\u00eame affaire Desormeaux, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal statua qu'en l'esp\u00e8ce, les circonstances ne justifiaient pas l'ajout du syndicat comme intim\u00e9. Elle statua que, bien qu'ayant conclu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que la Loi conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir d'ajouter des parties \u00e0 une instance lorsque le Tribunal le juge appropri\u00e9, le contexte l\u00e9gal entourant ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire milite en faveur d'une certaine retenue ou prudence ( caution est le terme utilis\u00e9 par la pr\u00e9sidente).\n[11] \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal a soulign\u00e9, fort \u00e0 propos \u00e0 mon avis, que la Loi pr\u00e9voit, dans le traitement des plaintes de discrimination, un processus d'enqu\u00eate et d'instruction fort \u00e9labor\u00e9 o\u00f9 tant la Commission que le Tribunal ont des r\u00f4les bien d\u00e9finis.\n[12] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal a fait \u00e9tat du fait que l'ajout de parties en cours d'instance devant le Tribunal prive le nouvel intim\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9fice de certains moyens de d\u00e9fense qu'il peut normalement faire valoir au stade de l'examen d'une plainte par la Commission, notamment de la possibilit\u00e9 de faire rejeter la plainte sans qu'il y ait besoin d'instituer une instruction devant le Tribunal, par exemple en raison du fait qu'elle fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l'expiration du d\u00e9lai d'un an pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\n[13] Par ailleurs, dans une d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal le 27 novembre 2002 dans Bozek et Commission canadienne des droits de la personne c. MCL Ryder Transport Inc. et McGill (T716\/2102 et T717\/2202), le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9, \u00e0 la suite d'une requ\u00eate faite en ce sens par la Commission et le plaignant, que la plainte initiale soit modifi\u00e9e afin de substituer au nom de l'intim\u00e9 initial celui de la compagnie n\u00e9e de la fusion de l'intim\u00e9 initial avec un certain nombre d'autres soci\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[14] L\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante, dans la d\u00e9cision Telus, le Tribunal a de nouveau conclu qu\u2019il avait comp\u00e9tence pour ajouter des intim\u00e9s. Il a aussi conclu qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles formelles \u00e0 ce sujet, l\u2019adjonction forc\u00e9e d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait appropri\u00e9e :\n[\u2026] s'il est \u00e9tabli que la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte dont il est saisi et qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l'adjonction d'un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte.\n[15] En 2004, le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a \u00e9dict\u00e9 une r\u00e8gle pr\u00e9voyant l\u2019adjonction de parties (paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles) cependant, cette r\u00e8gle \u2013 comme les autres r\u00e8gles du Tribunal \u2013 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e dans la Gazette du Canada, comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 48.9(3). Par cons\u00e9quent, on pourrait soutenir qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une r\u00e8gle formelle, selon l\u2019expression utilis\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Telus. De plus, le paragraphe 8(3) des R\u00e8gles ne prescrit pas de condition pr\u00e9alable pr\u00e9cise pour que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance d\u2019adjonction d\u2019une partie.\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente Canada (P.G.) c. Brown et al., 2008 CF 734, le juge Simon No\u00ebl, de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 les principes \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Telus.\n[17] M\u00eame depuis la d\u00e9cision Brown de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, la situation est rest\u00e9e la m\u00eame, aucune r\u00e8gle formelle n\u2019ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9dict\u00e9e au sujet de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de conditions \u00e0 remplir pour que le Tribunal puisse ajouter un nouvel intim\u00e9.\n[18] Je partage la pr\u00e9occupation du membre instructeur du Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Telus au sujet du fait que, \u00e0 toute fin utile, l\u2019adjonction d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal alors qu\u2019aucune plainte formelle n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre ce nouvel intim\u00e9 prive ce dernier de l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la Commission certains moyens de d\u00e9fense au sens des articles 41 et 44 de la Loi.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce a soutenu que le Tribunal devrait appliquer les enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Renaud \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en cause (Central Okanagan School District No. 23 c. Renaud, [1992] 2 R.C.S. 970).\n[20] \u00c0 ce sujet, je souhaite r\u00e9pondre avec le raisonnement du Tribunal dans Telus, auquel je souscris et qui, \u00e0 mon avis, est \u00e9galement applicable \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e8ce :\n[18] Il convient de souligner que les faits de l'affaire Renaud sont sensiblement diff\u00e9rents de ceux de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Dans l'affaire Renaud, le plaignant avait port\u00e9 plainte tant contre l'employeur que contre son syndicat, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Lors de l'audition de la plainte, le membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 modifia la plainte dont il \u00e9tait saisi de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 inclure une plainte contre le syndicat fond\u00e9e sur un autre article de la Loi en plus de celle fond\u00e9e sur l'article initial de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 rendre la plainte initiale conforme \u00e0 la nature de l'instance. Le membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 a justifi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision par le fait que cette modification ne causerait aucun pr\u00e9judice au syndicat puisque celui-ci avait \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tout au long des proc\u00e9dures et avait particip\u00e9 pleinement \u00e0 la plainte initiale, ce qui n'est pas le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. La Cour supr\u00eame confirma le bien-fond\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision du membre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 pour entendre la plainte.\n[21] Quant aux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9e fond\u00e9s sur des principes jurisprudentiels provenant des cours provinciales, je souligne humblement que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par ces principes, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis dans un contexte sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 diff\u00e9rent, et que le Tribunal ne peut pas choisir de les suivre lorsqu\u2019il existe une jurisprudence contraignante sur la question qui provient des cours de contr\u00f4le du Tribunal (c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans la d\u00e9cision Brown).\n[22] Dans Telus, le membre du Tribunal, Pierre Deschamps, a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate pour les motifs suivants :\n[36] En l'esp\u00e8ce, l'intim\u00e9 n'a pas convaincu le Tribunal que la mise en cause forc\u00e9e du SAQT est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte telle que libell\u00e9e. En outre, le Tribunal est d'avis que la mise en cause du SAQT \u00e0 ce stade-ci serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 ce dernier d'un point de vue d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[37] Cela dit, il sera loisible \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de faire valoir au cours de l'instruction devant le Tribunal que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal ne justifie pas le maintien de la plainte et qu'il ne saurait \u00eatre tenu responsable ou enti\u00e8rement responsable de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte.\n[23] Je souscris aux motifs du membre du Tribunal, qui s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Je note le fait que la plaignante s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019adjonction du Syndicat \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9. Je note aussi que la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal passablement de temps apr\u00e8s que la Commission eut renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal.\n[24] De plus, l\u2019intim\u00e9e aura l\u2019occasion d\u2019appeler \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner et d\u2019interroger un repr\u00e9sentant du Syndicat \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[25] Enfin, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut demander dans sa plaidoirie \u00e0 ce que, si la plainte est fond\u00e9e, le montant d\u2019indemnisation de la plaignante qui doit \u00eatre pay\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9e soit r\u00e9duit en fonction de la responsabilit\u00e9 conjointe \u00e9tablie et consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par le Tribunal .\nIII. Conclusion : [26] La requ\u00eate est rejet\u00e9e et l\u2019instruction de la plainte se d\u00e9roulera comme pr\u00e9vu.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon Membre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 14 octobre 2010\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1452\/7809\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Heather Lynn Grant c.

Introduction [1] Le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009, le Tribunal a rendu sa deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision dans laquelle il a conclu que les intim\u00e9s, Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada (APAC), avaient agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers les plaignants, George Vilven (Vilven) et Robert Neil Kelly (Kelly), en contravention de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). Le Tribunal a tenu une nouvelle audience pour d\u00e9terminer les mesures de redressement auxquelles les plaignants avaient droit en application de l\u2019article 53 de la LCDP.\n[2] Les plaignants demandent qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 :\nqu\u2019Air Canada et l\u2019APAC cessent d\u2019appliquer les dispositions portant sur la retraite obligatoire du r\u00e9gime de pension des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et de la convention collective pour tous les pilotes employ\u00e9s par Air Canada ; qu\u2019ils soient r\u00e9tablis comme pilotes au sein d\u2019Air Canada et qu\u2019ils retrouvent des affectations r\u00e9guli\u00e8res de vol conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 leur anciennet\u00e9, comme le d\u00e9terminera la Tribunal ; qu\u2019ils re\u00e7oivent une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire \u00e0 partir de leur date de retraite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur date de r\u00e9tablissement ; qu\u2019\u00e0 leur r\u00e9tablissement, ils continuent d\u2019accumuler leur droit \u00e0 pension et leurs autres avantages selon les m\u00eames conditions qu\u2019avant leur retraite ; que chacun des plaignants obtienne une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral de 20 000 $ et une indemnit\u00e9 de 20 000 $ pour le comportement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 des intim\u00e9s ; que leurs menues d\u00e9penses leur soient rembours\u00e9es ; que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 leur soit pay\u00e9.\nII. Injonction [3] Les plaignants demandent une ordonnance pour que les intim\u00e9s cessent d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 5.1 du R\u00e9gime de retraite des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et les dispositions correspondantes de la convention collective, \u00e9liminant ainsi la retraite obligatoire pour tous les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada.\n[4] L\u2019article 5.1 pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019un membre du r\u00e9gime de pension devra prendre sa retraite de la compagnie \u00e0 la date normale de sa retraite. La date normale de la retraite est d\u00e9finie au sous\u2011alin\u00e9a 1.2(ii) comme \u00e9tant le premier mois qui suit imm\u00e9diatement le mois lors duquel le membre atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans. Les intim\u00e9s acceptent une ordonnance leur enjoignant de cesser d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 5.1 du r\u00e9gime de pension, mais seulement envers les deux plaignants.\n[5] Dans sa deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP contrevenait \u00e0 la Charte, le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer cette disposition aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Cette conclusion suivait le principe bien \u00e9tabli dans un certain nombre de d\u00e9cisions de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, en commen\u00e7ant par l\u2019arr\u00eat Cuddy Chicks c. Ontario, [1991] 2 R.C.S. 517, dans lequel la Cour supr\u00eame, mentionnant la Commission des relations de travail de l\u2019Ontario, a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une d\u00e9claration formelle d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas une r\u00e9paration qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 la Commission et que celle-ci ne peut pas non plus s\u2019attendre \u00e0 une retenue judiciaire au sujet de ses d\u00e9cisions en mati\u00e8re constitutionnelle.\n[6] Dans la d\u00e9cision plus r\u00e9cente de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada Nouvelle\u2011\u00c9cosse (WCB) c. Martin, [2003] 2 R.C.S. 504, la Cour supr\u00eame a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 le principe selon lequel les r\u00e9parations constitutionnelles relevant des tribunaux administratifs sont limit\u00e9es et n\u2019incluent pas les d\u00e9clarations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019invalidit\u00e9. De plus, la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un tribunal qu\u2019une disposition de sa loi habilitante est invalide au regard de la Charte ne lie pas un autre tribunal ou un autre d\u00e9cideur.\n[7] Les plaignants acceptent cet \u00e9nonc\u00e9 de droit, tout comme la Commission. Cependant, ils demandent que le Tribunal n\u2019exerce que ses pouvoirs de redressement pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP. En particulier, ils demandent que le Tribunal ordonne que les intim\u00e9s cessent la pratique discriminatoire de la retraite obligatoire et prennent des mesures, en collaboration avec la Commission, pour \u00e9viter que la m\u00eame pratique ou une pratique semblable soit utilis\u00e9e dans l\u2019avenir. Autrement, le fait d\u2019appliquer la disposition de redressement seulement aux plaignants n\u2019aurait pas l\u2019effet de pr\u00e9venir la pratique discriminatoire dans l\u2019avenir.\n[8] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de sa position, la Commission se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat CN c. Canada (CCDP), [1987] 1 R.C.S. 1114 (Action Travail des Femmes). Dans cette affaire, Action Travail des Femmes, un groupe d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne dans laquelle il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que CN avait agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans ses pratiques d\u2019embauche et de promotion en refusant des occasions d\u2019emploi \u00e0 des femmes dans certains emplois de cols bleus non sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s.\n[9] Le Tribunal a conclu que la plainte \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e et a ordonn\u00e9 que CN mette en place un programme d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour r\u00e9gler la discrimination syst\u00e9mique. CN a port\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision en appel, en soutenant que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de prendre une telle ordonnance de redressement en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(2)a) de la LCDP (maintenant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a)).\n[10] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a rejet\u00e9 cet argument, soulignant que cette disposition visait \u00e0 traiter le probl\u00e8me de la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et qu\u2019un programme d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi visait \u00e0 briser le cycle continu de la discrimination. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la Cour supr\u00eame a not\u00e9 que l\u2019objectif n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019indemniser les victimes ant\u00e9rieures ni d\u2019offrir de nouvelles occasions pour certains individus pr\u00e9cis \u00e0 qui on avait injustement refus\u00e9 des promotions ou des emplois pr\u00e9cis par le pass\u00e9.\nA. Conclusion au sujet de l\u2019injonction [11] \u00c0 mon avis, la Commission ne peut pas se fonder sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Action Travail des Femmes. L\u2019affaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ne porte pas sur une plainte de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. L\u2019affaire Action Travail des femmes portait sur une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par un groupe d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public au nom d\u2019un grand nombre de victimes all\u00e9gu\u00e9es d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire. Il s\u2019agit en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 deux plaignants distincts avaient la m\u00eame plainte. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une plainte de groupe. Ce que les plaignants demandent, c\u2019est que la mesure de redressement qui leur sera accord\u00e9e soit \u00e9tendue au\u2011del\u00e0 de leurs plaintes individuelles.\n[12] De plus, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a soulign\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, sa conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP viole la Charte n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent juridique et n\u2019est applicable qu\u2019aux faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans les circonstances, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) reste en vigueur et peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 par les intim\u00e9s comme d\u00e9fense dans toute plainte en cours ou future au sujet de la politique obligatoire en question. Le fait d\u2019accorder l\u2019injonction demand\u00e9e les priverait de la d\u00e9fense que cet article leur accorde.\n[13] Enfin, si le Tribunal rendait l\u2019injonction, en ayant recours \u00e0 son pouvoir pr\u00e9vu par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a), il s\u2019accorderait des pouvoirs qui rel\u00e8vent normalement d\u2019un juge nomm\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 96. \u00c0 mon avis, le pouvoir de redressement doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 en fonction des limites impos\u00e9es par la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin.\n[14] La fa\u00e7on plus appropri\u00e9e d\u2019appliquer les enseignements de l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin et l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la mesure de redressement est pour le Tribunal d\u2019annuler la cessation d\u2019emploi des plaignants en ordonnant aux intim\u00e9s de cesser d\u2019appliquer le paragraphe 5(1) du r\u00e9gime de pension envers les plaignants et de r\u00e9parer la pratique discriminatoire en ordonnant leur r\u00e9tablissement.\nIII. R\u00e9tablissement [15] Air Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les plaignants seront r\u00e9tablis dans leur emploi en fonction des crit\u00e8res normaux d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Les plaignants doivent avoir une licence de pilote valide, un certificat m\u00e9dical valide indiquant qu\u2019ils sont en \u00e9tat de piloter un a\u00e9ronef commercial en fonction des normes m\u00e9dicales applicables de Transports Canada et soit qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une qualification de vol aux instruments \u00e0 jour, soit qu\u2019ils aient la capacit\u00e9 de renouveler cette qualification. Kelly satisfait \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res. Au moment de l\u2019audience, Vilven n\u2019avait pas de qualification de vol aux instruments \u00e0 jour, mais il avait la capacit\u00e9 de renouveler cette qualification.\n[16] Lorsqu\u2019il sera satisfait \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res, Air Canada r\u00e9tablira les plaignants dans leur poste et ils pourront participer \u00e0 la prochaine formation offerte sur l\u2019\u00e9quipement qu\u2019ils peuvent piloter en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019ils auront termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s leur formation, ils n\u2019auront pas \u00e0 attendre le prochain tour d\u2019appel d\u2019offres pour l\u2019\u00e9quipement. Ils seront plac\u00e9s sur la liste des postes d\u00e8s le prochain appel d\u2019offres mensuel. Les plaignants ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces conditions sont satisfaisantes.\n[17] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la formation, ils auraient besoin d\u2019une formation compl\u00e8te, d\u2019une instruction pr\u00e9vol, d\u2019un cours sur simulateur et d\u2019un vol avec un commandant de bord en ligne. Air Canada estime que l\u2019instruction pr\u00e9vol durerait environ deux semaines, de m\u00eame pour le cours sur simulateur et le vol avec un commandant de bord en ligne. Il faudrait de deux \u00e0 trois mois tout au plus pour obtenir une date de formation.\nIV. La mesure de redressement quant \u00e0 la pension [18] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la mesure de redressement quant \u00e0 la pension, les plaignants demandent que, d\u00e8s leur r\u00e9tablissement, ils re\u00e7oivent le salaire et les avantages d\u2019un employ\u00e9 actif, y compris l\u2019accumulation continue de leur droit \u00e0 pension, selon les m\u00eames conditions qu\u2019avant leur retraite. Air Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la m\u00eame position dans sa preuve, mais a demand\u00e9 que le droit \u00e0 pension soit assujetti au d\u00e9gagement des transactions de pension pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes.\n[19] Le d\u00e9gagement signifie que les plaignants doivent repayer les prestations mensuelles de pension qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7ues, \u00e0 partir de la date d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de r\u00e9tablissement et qu\u2019ils doivent rembourser les contributions \u00e0 la pension requises pour cette p\u00e9riode.\n[20] L\u2019APAC \u00e9tait d\u2019abord d\u2019avis qu\u2019une ordonnance pour l\u2019accumulation de pension apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans serait contraire aux dispositions du r\u00e9gime de pension et d\u00e9passerait la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Cependant, comme l\u2019APAC a accept\u00e9 l\u2019injonction au sujet de l\u2019article 5.1 du r\u00e9gime de pension en faveur des plaignants, elle ne maintient plus cette objection.\nV. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire et la position sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 [21] Les plaignants soutiennent que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre la p\u00e9riode d\u00e9butant \u00e0 la date de leur retraites respectives, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de leur r\u00e9tablissement en poste \u00e0 Air Canada. Ils demandent \u00e0 \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9s pour le salaire, y compris les primes et l\u2019int\u00e9ressement, qu\u2019ils auraient gagn\u00e9 s\u2019ils avaient continu\u00e9 leur emploi, moins le revenu compensateur et les paiements de pension qu\u2019ils ont re\u00e7us pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnisation.\nA. Vilven [22] Pour d\u00e9terminer le montant de sa perte de salaire, Vilven s\u2019est fond\u00e9 sur la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnisation du 31 ao\u00fbt 2003 au 30 avril 2010. Sa m\u00e9thodologie a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019abord de d\u00e9terminer son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada qu\u2019il aurait eu pendant les ann\u00e9es allant de 2003 \u00e0 2010 s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pris sa retraite. La prochaine \u00e9tape a \u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019affectation comme pilote qu\u2019il aurait occup\u00e9 pour chacune des ann\u00e9es, en fonction de son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent.\n[23] Enfin, le salaire mensuel pour chacun des postes de pilote \u00e9quivalents a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 en fonction des tableaux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration de la convention collective, en supposant que les pilotes dans ces postes auraient eu des horaires de vol en fonction des points suivants, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 estim\u00e9s par les parties \u00eatre des suppositions raisonnables :\nle taux horaire en fonction de la convention collective pour le poste \u00e9quivalent lors des p\u00e9riodes de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration respectives ; 81 heures de vol par mois, dont la moiti\u00e9 serait calcul\u00e9e au tarif de jour et l\u2019autre moiti\u00e9, au tarif de nuit, en plus de la prime pour le service outre\u2011mer pour 71 heures ; le salaire mensuel doit \u00eatre multipli\u00e9 par 12 pour obtenir un salaire annuel pour chaque p\u00e9riode.\n(i) Le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent [24] Lorsque Vilven a pris sa retraite en ao\u00fbt 2003, son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait 1404. Pour les ann\u00e9es suivantes, soit de 2004 \u00e0 2010, Vilven a utilis\u00e9 le pilote C.E. Hintz comme pilote de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou \u00e9quivalent. Selon Vilven, Hintz a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par Air Canada un an apr\u00e8s lui, donc, s\u2019il n\u2019avait pas pris sa retraite, il aurait eu le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Hintz pendant ces ann\u00e9es.\n[25] Pour d\u00e9terminer son \u00e9quivalent d\u2019affectation comme pilote, Vilven s\u2019est d\u2019abord plac\u00e9 dans un poste de B747 PO YYZ. Il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour ce poste en 2001, mais il a continu\u00e9 de piloter \u00e0 titre de A340 PO YVR jusqu\u2019\u00e0 sa retraite. Cependant, de juillet 2003 \u00e0 ao\u00fbt 2003, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9 au salaire d\u2019un B747 PO YYZ.\n[26] La prochaine \u00e9tape consistait \u00e0 trouver sa cohorte \u00e9quivalente pour les ann\u00e9es 2003 \u00e0 2010, qui \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9e de 5 pilotes ayant plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que lui et de 5 pilotes ayant moins d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que lui, bas\u00e9s \u00e0 Toronto. Il a tenu comme raisonnement que, sauf pour la clause 25.06.02 de la convention collective, il aurait obtenu ce poste en 2003.\n[27] En se fondant sur la liste d\u2019affectations des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada pour ces ann\u00e9es et sur son anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalente, Vilven a conclu qu\u2019il aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature et qu\u2019il aurait occup\u00e9 les postes et l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 comme il l\u2019a \u00e9tabli \u00e0 l\u2019annexe I.\n[28] En appliquant les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration susmentionn\u00e9s, Vilven soutient que son salaire total aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 1 086 093 $ du 1er septembre 2009 au 30 avril 2010 (voir l\u2019annexe 1). Ce montant ne tient pas compte des prestations de retraite qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ues, des contributions \u00e0 la pension exig\u00e9es ni du salaire d\u2019att\u00e9nuation qu\u2019il a obtenu pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[29] \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape, la question est de savoir si Vilven peut utiliser le poste B747 PO YYZ comme point de d\u00e9part, plut\u00f4t que le poste qu\u2019il occupait \u00e0 la retraite, soit le A340 PO YVR. Selon le R\u00e9gime de retraite des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, les prestations de retraite d\u2019un pilote sont fond\u00e9es sur la moyenne de leurs cinq meilleures ann\u00e9es de salaire, qui sont normalement les soixante mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la retraite, multipli\u00e9s par les ann\u00e9es de service.\n[30] Vilven a eu 60 ans en ao\u00fbt 2003. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il avait 22 ann\u00e9es de service ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Pour optimiser son revenu admissible, Vilven soutient qu\u2019il avait pour habitude de toujours exercer ses droits d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour un poste dans les a\u00e9ronefs de plus haut calibre, qui offrent un plus haut taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration.\n[31] En 1998, Vilven occupait le poste d\u2019A320 PO \u00e0 Winnipeg. Il savait qu\u2019en ao\u00fbt 1998, il d\u00e9butait ses cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es comme pilote chez Air Canada. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 afin d\u2019optimiser son salaire avant la fin de 1999 ou le d\u00e9but de 2000, auquel moment il a exerc\u00e9 son droit d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour \u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto comme A340 PO. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il ne l\u2019avait pas fait plus t\u00f4t, il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9, qu\u2019il avait mal calcul\u00e9.\n[32] Environ six mois plus tard, soit en 2000, Vilven a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver comme A340 PO. Il l\u2019a fait en sachant qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune diff\u00e9rence de salaire entre Toronto et Vancouver pour un A340 PO. Il a aussi reconnu que son anciennet\u00e9 relative \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9tait moindre que celle \u00e0 Toronto, alors il n\u2019aurait pas les m\u00eames occasions de choisir des vacances et des horaires mensuels plus int\u00e9ressants.\n[33] Vilven a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi il avait choisi d\u2019\u00eatre mut\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver en 2000 comme A340 PO plut\u00f4t que de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour un poste de pilote plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 ailleurs. Pendant l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal en janvier 2007, alors que le Tribunal examinait le bien\u2011fond\u00e9 de sa plainte, Vilven a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 A340 PO \u00e9tait qu\u2019il souhaitait piloter les gros a\u00e9ronefs et que cela n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible s\u2019il obtenait une promotion comme A320. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver, que sa m\u00e8re, ses deux s\u0153urs et ses amis y habitent et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tout \u00e0 fait naturel qu\u2019il demande une affectation \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[34] Vancouver est la base o\u00f9 il y a le plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 Air Canada et il ne lui \u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019avoir un poste de commandant de bord \u00e0 Vancouver. Il a soutenu qu\u2019il aurait pu avoir un poste de commandant de bord \u00e0 Winnipeg, \u00e0 Toronto ou \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al, mais il voulait \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver et il voulait piloter sur des vols internationaux. Compte tenu de ses ann\u00e9es de service, il lui \u00e9tait impossible de le faire comme commandant de bord.\n[35] Vilven a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que par moments, il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas exercer ses droits d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il souhaitait rester dans une ville en particulier. Vilven a aussi dit au Tribunal, lors de l\u2019audience de janvier 2007, que si sa plainte \u00e9tait accueillie, il aimerait retourner \u00e0 Vancouver comme pilote pour Air Canada.\n[36] Lors de l\u2019audience suivante devant le Tribunal au sujet des mesures de redressement, Vilven a soutenu que son t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent au sujet de la raison pour laquelle il avait demand\u00e9 une affectation \u00e0 Vancouver n\u2019\u00e9tait pas correct. Bien que sa base \u00e9tait \u00e0 Vancouver, il habitait \u00e0 Calgary ou \u00e0 Airdrie, \u00e0 environ une heure et demie de Vancouver. De nombreux pilotes d\u2019Air Canada n\u2019habitent pas \u00e0 la base o\u00f9 ils travaillent.\n[37] Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait une autre partie \u00e0 son r\u00e9cit. Il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 Vancouver parce qu\u2019il y avait plus d\u2019occasions d\u2019\u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail et de faire du travail sur simulateur qu\u2019\u00e0 Toronto, parce qu\u2019une grande partie des pilotes qui ont plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver ne souhaitaient pas travailler pendant leurs journ\u00e9es de cong\u00e9. Il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de tirer cette conclusion en examinant les vols hors programmes et les vols non pr\u00e9vus sur les horaires d\u2019\u00e9quipage. \u00c0 la base de Toronto, les vols \u00e9taient plus structur\u00e9s et il lui semblait que plus de pilotes ayant une plus grande anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto souhaitaient piloter plus souvent.\n[38] Ce faisant, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019optimiser son revenu. Par exemple, son revenu ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension \u00e0 titre de A340 PO YVR en 2000 \u00e9tait de 179 000 $; en 2001, de 175 000 $; en 2002, de 176 000 $; et pour huit mois en 2003, de 130 000 $. Il aurait pu occuper un poste de pilote A320, mais en comparaison, un pilote A320 gagnait environ 165 000 $ en 2006, et il n\u2019y avait eu aucune augmentation de salaire avant cette date.\n[39] Vilven a reconnu que lorsqu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto comme B747 PO, il aurait perdu le rappel au travail et le travail sur simulateur qu\u2019il aurait pu faire \u00e0 Vancouver, mais il a soutenu qu\u2019il y aurait pu y avoir des occasions \u00e0 Toronto d\u2019effectuer du tel travail suppl\u00e9mentaire. Cependant, il a ensuite reconnu qu\u2019il avait quitt\u00e9 Toronto pour \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver dans le m\u00eame poste d\u2019A340 PO parce qu\u2019il pouvait gagner plus \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[40] Alors pourquoi red\u00e9m\u00e9nager \u00e0 Toronto ? Vilven a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la raison pour laquelle il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste de B747 PO YYZ en 2001 \u00e9tait qu\u2019il y avait eu auparavant une diminution de salaire d\u2019environ 15 p. 100 pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada. Le suppl\u00e9ment pour le poste de B747 \u00e9tait de 12 1\/2 p. 100, et en pr\u00e9sentant sa candidature pour le poste de B747, il pouvait compenser presque enti\u00e8rement pour la r\u00e9duction de salaire de 15 p. 100.\n[41] Il a reconnu que les 179 000 $ qu\u2019il a gagn\u00e9s comme A340 PO YVR en 2000 repr\u00e9sentaient environ 30 000 $ de plus que son salaire de base d\u2019A340 PO, ce qui est beaucoup plus que 12 1\/2 p. 100. Vilven a r\u00e9pondu que certains de ses coll\u00e8gues qui \u00e9taient B747 PO \u00e0 Toronto gagnaient plus de 200 000 $. Il y avait beaucoup d\u2019occasions pendant ces ann\u00e9es et les pilotes \u00e9taient constamment rappel\u00e9s au travail. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature plus t\u00f4t, il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il avait \u00e9videmment mal calcul\u00e9.\n[42] Le capitaine Duke, d\u2019Air Canada, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les pilotes pr\u00e9sentent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement leur candidature pour le poste qui offre le salaire le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, peu importe la base, au cours des derniers mois avant de prendre leur retraite, sachant qu\u2019ils seront gel\u00e9s dans leur poste actuel en vertu de la clause 25.06 02 de la convention collective.\n[43] Ils le font en sachant qu\u2019ils n\u2019auront pas \u00e0 occuper ce poste ou \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9s \u00e0 une autre base, ce qui signifierait qu\u2019ils devraient d\u00e9m\u00e9nager, suivre un cours de formation sur a\u00e9ronef et se retrouver comme pilote de niveau inf\u00e9rieur pour le nouvel \u00e9quipement et donc souffrir un horaire de moindre anciennet\u00e9.\n[44] Par cons\u00e9quent, il s\u2019agissait pour Vilven du meilleur des deux mondes. Il pouvait garder ses privil\u00e8ges d\u2019appel d\u2019offres compte tenu de son anciennet\u00e9 dans le poste A340 PO YVR, continuer \u00e0 \u00eatre rappel\u00e9 au travail et \u00e0 faire du travail sur simulateur et obtenir le salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019un B747 PO. C\u2019est la fa\u00e7on dont la convention collective est \u00e9tablie et de nombreux pilotes en prennent avantage.\n(ii) Conclusion au sujet de l\u2019optimisation des revenus de Vilven [45] \u00c0 mon avis, Vilven n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une tendance \u00e0 l\u2019optimisation de son revenu. Le fait est qu\u2019il savait en 1998 qu\u2019il d\u00e9butait ses derniers soixante mois avant la retraite. Pourtant, il n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto avant 2000, o\u00f9 il pouvait augmenter son revenu ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait parce qu\u2019il a fait une erreur de calcul.\n[46] Il a pass\u00e9 environ six mois \u00e0 Toronto, puis il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver dans le m\u00eame poste qu\u2019il occupait \u00e0 Toronto. Il semble qu\u2019il a gagn\u00e9 beaucoup plus que son salaire de base d\u2019A340 PO, mais il n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour le poste de B747 PO YYZ avant 2001, m\u00eame s\u2019il savait que beaucoup de ses coll\u00e8gues \u00e9taient [traduction] constamment rappel\u00e9s au travail et qu\u2019ils gagnaient plus de 200 000 $ par ann\u00e9e. Quant \u00e0 lui, il avait fait une erreur de calcul.\n[47] Le t\u00e9moignage de Vilven selon lequel il a calcul\u00e9 ses d\u00e9m\u00e9nagements afin d\u2019optimiser son salaire n\u2019est pas tr\u00e8s convaincant. Il ne l\u2019a pas fait lorsque l\u2019occasion s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Bien qu\u2019il ait rectifi\u00e9 le tir plus tard, son premier t\u00e9moignage appuie la conclusion selon laquelle sa base pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e9tait Vancouver, qui est relativement pr\u00e8s de son domicile \u00e0 Calgary et pr\u00e8s de sa famille et de ses amis, qui habitent \u00e0 Vancouver.\n[48] Je retiens le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke selon lequel les pilotes dans la situation de Vilven posent leur candidature pour un poste en sachant qu\u2019ils n\u2019auront pas l\u2019obligation de changer de poste. Vilven avait le meilleur des deux mondes. Il restait A340 PO \u00e0 Vancouver, obtenait le salaire d\u2019un B747 PO pendant un certain temps et continuait d\u2019arrondir son revenu par des rappels au travail et du travail sur simulateur.\n[49] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour le calcul de la perte de salaire de Vilven, le salaire mensuel devrait \u00eatre celui d\u2019un A340 PO YVR en cours pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 telle qu\u2019\u00e9tablie par le Tribunal.\nB. Kelly, calcul de la perte de salaire et de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 [50] Pour d\u00e9terminer sa perte de salaire et son anciennet\u00e9, Kelly a conclu que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e9butait le 1er mai 2005 et se terminait le 30 avril 2010. Il a utilis\u00e9 la m\u00eame m\u00e9thodologie que Vilven, en d\u00e9terminant d\u2019abord son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent, puis son \u00e9quivalent d\u2019affectation comme pilote pour chacune des ann\u00e9es.\n(i) Anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalente [51] Kelly a pris sa retraite comme pilote A340 YYZ le 1er mai 2005. Son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 dans la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u00e9tait 79. Cependant, en raison des normes de l\u2019OACI \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il ne pouvait faire des vols internationaux qu\u2019\u00e0 titre de premier officier (PO) et non comme pilote avant le 23 novembre 2006. Kelly, avec le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 79, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s haut sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et aurait occup\u00e9 le poste le plus ancien d\u2019A340 PO YYZ.\n[52] Pour les ann\u00e9es 2006 \u00e0 2010, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 telle qu\u2019elle para\u00eet sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes, Kelly a conclu que W.C. Ronan \u00e9tait son pilote de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou \u00e9quivalent. En suivant la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour ces ann\u00e9es, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Kelly aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 un chiffre en dessous de celui de Ronan.\n[53] Ensuite, en se fiant \u00e0 la liste des affectations des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada pour ces ann\u00e9es et \u00e0 son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent, Kelly a conclu qu\u2019il aurait eu l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et aurait occup\u00e9 les postes inscrits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe II.\n[54] Kelly a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux calculs pour la perte de salaire. Premi\u00e8rement, en appliquant les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration inscrits \u00e0 l\u2019annexe II pour les \u00e9quivalents d\u2019affectation comme pilote, il a obtenu un salaire total de 1 040 128 $ du 1er mai 2005 au 30 avril 2010.\n[55] L\u2019autre calcul se trouve dans un document que Kelly a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve, [traduction] \u00c9tat des revenus annuels, R.N. Kelly. Ce document montre une perte de salaire estim\u00e9e de mai 2005 \u00e0 avril 2010 d\u2019un montant de 341 574 $.\n[56] L\u2019APAC a pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 Kelly au sujet de son sc\u00e9nario de pilote \u00e9quivalent, qui montre que du 1er mai 2005 au 1er d\u00e9cembre 2006, il aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste inf\u00e9rieur, passant de commandant de bord A340 \u00e0 A340 PO afin de r\u00e9pondre aux normes de l\u2019OACI. Apr\u00e8s le 1er d\u00e9cembre 2006, il aurait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour reprendre un poste de commandant de bord.\n[57] L\u2019APAC a not\u00e9 que cela ne tient pas compte de la clause 25.06.06 de la convention collective, qui donne \u00e0 Air Canada le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019emp\u00eacher un pilote de changer d\u2019\u00e9quipement ou de statut pendant une p\u00e9riode de 48 mois.\n[58] Le t\u00e9moignage du capitaine Duke \u00e9tait que l\u2019objet de la clause 25.06.06 \u00e9tait d\u2019\u00e9viter qu\u2019Air Canada paie des co\u00fbts de formation. Elle va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la tendance de carri\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d\u2019un pilote qui est de commencer au bas de l\u2019\u00e9chelle et de monter en fonction de son anciennet\u00e9. \u00c0 mesure que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 augmente, le pilote est form\u00e9 pour pouvoir piloter de l\u2019\u00e9quipement sup\u00e9rieur.\n[59] Le capitaine Duke a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le principal facteur dont il est tenu compte lors de l\u2019exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est le co\u00fbt de formation. Il a reconnu que le co\u00fbt de formation pour passer du si\u00e8ge gauche au si\u00e8ge droit dans un a\u00e9ronef en particulier est minime, soit une ou deux heures dans un simulateur et possiblement une v\u00e9rification en ligne.\n[60] Il y a trois raisons pour ne pas tenir compte de ce facteur. Premi\u00e8rement, le sc\u00e9nario de l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019affectation comme pilote refl\u00e8te une situation hypoth\u00e9tique. Deuxi\u00e8mement, si les co\u00fbts de formation sont le crit\u00e8re principal et sont aussi minimes, il n\u2019est pas raisonnable de conclure qu\u2019Air Canada exercerait son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire contre la candidature, en particulier lorsqu\u2019Air Canada use d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire. Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019experte d\u2019Air Canada, Alexandra Leslie, dans ses sc\u00e9narios d\u2019indemnit\u00e9, n\u2019a pas non plus tenu compte de la clause 25.06.06. Les sc\u00e9narios sont donc sur le m\u00eame pied.\nC. Att\u00e9nuation (i) Vilven [61] Vilven a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2003, en pr\u00e9vision de sa retraite et pour pouvoir continuer \u00e0 piloter, il s\u2019est inscrit aupr\u00e8s de Park Aviation, une agence d\u2019embauche en Europe, et il a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 un certain nombre de transporteurs a\u00e9riens europ\u00e9ens. Il n\u2019a pas obtenu d\u2019emploi de cette fa\u00e7on. Il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun de ces courriels ni aucune demande d\u2019emploi.\n[62] Il a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait appel\u00e9 un certain nombre de transporteurs a\u00e9riens au Canada, mais il est impossible de dire en quelle ann\u00e9e il l\u2019a fait. Il avait compil\u00e9 une liste de transporteurs a\u00e9riens avec qui il communiquait tous les six mois pour mettre \u00e0 jour son curriculum vitae. Il n\u2019y avait pas de dates sur la liste pr\u00e9cisant quand il avait communiqu\u00e9 avec les transporteurs a\u00e9riens, et il a oubli\u00e9 de produire la liste \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[63] Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il communiquait avec les transporteurs a\u00e9riens et qu\u2019il parlait au pilote en chef ou \u00e0 sa secr\u00e9taire. Il a dit qu\u2019il avait communiqu\u00e9 avec les transporteurs a\u00e9riens Flair, Skyservice, Air Transat, Kelowna Flightcraft, Arctic Sunwest, Buffalo Airways, Hawk Air, Nolinor Aviation, Morning Star Aviation, Pacific Coastal et Air Saskatchewan. Il n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec Jazz Airline, Air Inuit, Canadian North, Porter Airline, Air Tindi, North Caribou Airline, Prince Edward Air, Provincial Airlines, Regional One Airlines, Trans Capitol Air, Transwest, Air Wasaya Airways, Central Mountain Air, Labrador Airline ou Calm Air.\n[64] Vilven \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il y avait un gros obstacle pour obtenir un emploi avec ces transporteurs a\u00e9riens. Il leur a dit qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9parait \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et qu\u2019il avait l\u2019intention de retourner \u00e0 Air Canada s\u2019il le pouvait. Il voulait que les transporteurs a\u00e9riens le sachent, parce que cela ne lui semblait pas \u00eatre moral ou \u00e9thique qu\u2019ils doivent d\u00e9penser 15 000 $ ou 20 000 $ pour le former et qu\u2019il puisse d\u00e9missionner peu de temps apr\u00e8s.\n[65] Vilven n\u2019a pas travaill\u00e9 pour un transporteur a\u00e9rien de septembre 2003 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 janvier ou f\u00e9vrier 2005, auquel moment il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 piloter pour Flair Airlines. Il a cess\u00e9 de piloter pour Flair en mai 2006. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il pilotait environ 15 jours par mois, \u00e9tait pay\u00e9 par d\u00e9placement et gagnait environ 5 000 $ par mois. Depuis sa retraite, il avait pilot\u00e9 environ 150 heures, toutes avec Flair Airlines.\n[66] La raison pour laquelle il a quitt\u00e9 \u00e9tait que Flair avait un contrat militaire pour transporter les troupes entre Trenton et Edmonton et que le transporteur voulait qu\u2019il s\u2019engage \u00e0 piloter environ 15 jours par mois. Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 bas\u00e9 \u00e0 Calgary, mais aurait pilot\u00e9 \u00e0 partir de Toronto.\n[67] Vilven a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas prendre cet engagement en raison de l\u2019audition de sa plainte devant le Tribunal, qui devait d\u00e9buter en janvier 2007. Il croyait que cela n\u00e9cessiterait beaucoup de pr\u00e9paration de sa part et qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas le temps d\u2019effectuer cette pr\u00e9paration s\u2019il devait piloter. Il voulait se consacrer \u00e0 temps plein \u00e0 l\u2019avancement de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et il croyait que cela l\u2019emportait sur son obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ses dommages.\n[68] Vilven a reconnu que tant la Fly Past 60 Coalition que la Commission, bien qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse pas de son avocat, repr\u00e9sentaient ses int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun dossier montrant le temps qu\u2019il a pass\u00e9 \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audience, mais il a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019entre le moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 chez Flair et janvier 2007, auquel moment l\u2019audience a d\u00e9but\u00e9, il avait travaill\u00e9 un minimum de 20 \u00e0 30 heures par semaine. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait utilis\u00e9 ce temps pour lire des articles et pour v\u00e9rifier certaines preuves. Ses conclusions \u00e9crites finales pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal \u00e9taient constitu\u00e9es de deux pages et il a eu besoin d\u2019environ quatre jours pour \u00e9crire ces deux pages.\n(ii) Kelly [69] Lorsqu\u2019il a pris sa retraite en mai 2005, sa qualification pour le Airbus 330\/340, B757 et B767 \u00e9tait valide jusqu\u2019en 2007. Il a maintenu son certificat m\u00e9dical de l\u2019aviation civile de cat\u00e9gorie un et sa licence de pilote.\n[70] Kelly a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 piloter pour Skyservice en novembre 2005 et il l\u2019a fait jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin avril 2006. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9invit\u00e9 par Skyservice et y a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 de novembre 2006 jusqu\u2019en mars 2007, pas \u00e0 temps plein, mais \u00e0 titre d\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 contrat, sans avantages.\n[71] Son emploi avec Skyservice \u00e9tait un contrat \u00e0 titre de membre d\u2019\u00e9quipage de conduite, pour lequel il a d\u2019abord pilot\u00e9 comme premier officier lors de la premi\u00e8re saison, et comme commandant de bord lors de la deuxi\u00e8me saison. On lui a offert une affectation d\u2019hiver de novembre 2007 \u00e0 avril 2008 \u00e0 partir de Calgary comme premier officier. Il avis\u00e9 Skyservice qu\u2019il accepterait un poste de premier officier bas\u00e9 \u00e0 Toronto ou de commandant de bord \u00e0 Calgary, mais on lui a r\u00e9pondu que ces postes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas disponibles. Pour lui, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas financi\u00e8rement logique de travailler \u00e0 partir de Calgary comme premier officier en raison des frais d\u2019h\u00f4tel, de d\u00e9placement et de repas, qui auraient utilis\u00e9 tout son salaire.\n[72] Kelly a pos\u00e9 sa candidature aupr\u00e8s de Jet Airways en novembre 2007, mais on lui a dit que, comme son contr\u00f4le de la comp\u00e9tence du pilote avait plus de deux ans, il devrait suivre une formation compl\u00e8te, et Jet Airways \u00e9tait incapable de lui offrir un poste \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[73] \u00c0 partir de 2005, il a consult\u00e9 de nombreux sites Web qui contenaient des renseignements au sujet des transporteurs a\u00e9riens dans le monde, pour trouver des postes de pilote. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 son curriculum vitae \u00e0 Park Aviation en 2005, dans lequel il indiquait son exp\u00e9rience de vol et ses qualifications pour les a\u00e9ronefs.\n[74] Kelly a produit des documents montrant les r\u00e9sultats de sa recherche et les autres efforts qu\u2019il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s de 2005 \u00e0 2010 pour obtenir un emploi. Il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 plusieurs des occasions et il a aussi effectu\u00e9 une recherche d\u2019emploi pour des transporteurs a\u00e9riens au Canada qui op\u00e9raient le type d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs pour lesquels ses qualifications \u00e9taient \u00e0 jour. Ses qualifications \u00e9taient \u00e0 jour lorsqu\u2019il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter sa candidature en 2005, mais elles ont ensuite expir\u00e9.\n[75] Il a aussi communiqu\u00e9 avec Zoom Airlines en 2005, mais la compagnie n\u2019embauchait pas. Il a communiqu\u00e9 avec Harmony Airlines, mais la compagnie \u00e9tait en d\u00e9clin \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et n\u2019embauchait pas de pilotes. Il a aussi effectu\u00e9 une recherche Internet pour des postes d\u2019A330 de pilotes en Europe, en Australie et au Canada. Il y avait un poste par contrat offert par Park Aviation, mais on recherchait un pilote de moins de 50 ans et qui avait pilot\u00e9 un A330 au cours des six derniers mois.\n[76] Comme sa qualification n\u2019\u00e9tait plus \u00e0 jour apr\u00e8s avril 2007, il devait suivre une formation compl\u00e8te pour pouvoir piloter des avions commerciaux, pour laquelle il devait personnellement d\u00e9bourser pr\u00e8s de 40 000 $. Cela ne lui semblait pas \u00eatre un bon investissement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[77] Kelly a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait aussi fait une recherche pr\u00e9liminaire aupr\u00e8s de certaines entreprises de transport au Canada. Cependant, ces entreprises n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pr\u00eates \u00e0 payer pour sa formation. Il s\u2019est souvenu avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec Kelowna Flightcraft et Cargo Jet pendant la p\u00e9riode entre 2007 et 2008.\n[78] \u00c0 son avis, les possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019obtenir un emploi apr\u00e8s Skyservice \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s faibles, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il investisse dans une certification pour un a\u00e9ronef en demande et qu\u2019il paie les frais de formation.\n[79] Cependant, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu des occasions pour piloter outre\u2011mer comme employ\u00e9 \u00e0 contrat en 2006 et en 2007. Cependant, il avait choisi de ne pas travailler pour des op\u00e9rations estivales parce que leurs activit\u00e9s \u00e9taient en Europe et qu\u2019il ne souhait pas \u00eatre loin de sa famille toute l\u2019ann\u00e9e.\n[80] L\u2019\u00e9valuation de Kelly du march\u00e9 du travail \u00e9tait qu\u2019en 2007, il y avait une p\u00e9nurie de pilotes dans le monde entier, en particulier en Inde et en Chine. Cependant, il y avait une demande limit\u00e9e au Canada. Il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que s\u2019il devait obtenir un emploi pour un transporteur a\u00e9rien en Inde, par exemple, il devrait suivre une formation d\u2019environ six mois pour \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9. Par exp\u00e9rience, la bureaucratie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en faveur d\u2019offrir des contrats \u00e0 des expatri\u00e9s pour des postes de pilote en Inde. Il avait effectu\u00e9 de nombreux voyages en Inde et, franchement, il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019un endroit o\u00f9 il souhaitait habiter. Il avait choisi le Canada comme pays et il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait y habiter et y travailler.\n[81] Son gendre est pilote pour Air Georgia \u00e0 Toronto. Cependant, Kelly n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 pour les a\u00e9ronefs d\u2019Air Georgia. Il aurait pu \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 pour un a\u00e9ronef \u00e0 turbopropulseur, \u00e0 ses frais, pour environ 30 000 $, mais il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 Air Canada.\n(iii) Conclusion sur l\u2019att\u00e9nuation [82] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que les plaignants ont l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuer leurs dommages et ils citent la d\u00e9cision Chopra \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cet avis. Dans le cas de Vilven, ils soutiennent qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas fait, en limitant ses recherches de travail et en refusant de continuer \u00e0 travailler pour Flair Airlines apr\u00e8s mai 2006, afin de se consacrer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de sa plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Comme il n\u2019a pas satisfait \u00e0 son obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuation, les intim\u00e9s demandent au Tribunal de ne pas lui accorder d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\n[83] Quand \u00e0 Kelly, les intim\u00e9s reconnaissent qu\u2019il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de plus grands efforts que Vilven pour se trouver un emploi, mais ils soutiennent que ses efforts n\u2019ont pas suffit. Ils mentionnent le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger pendant l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 avec Skyservice \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du Canada ou \u00e0 se chercher un poste de pilote \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger parce qu\u2019il avait choisi d\u2019habiter et de travailler au Canada. Ils soulignent aussi le fait qu\u2019il a refus\u00e9 de travailler pendant un troisi\u00e8me hiver avec Skyservice parce qu\u2019il ne croyait pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une d\u00e9cision avantageuse du point de vue financier. Les intim\u00e9s demandent au Tribunal de retrancher de 50 p. 100 toute indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire pour Kelly.\n[84] L\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra n\u2019impose pas d\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuation aux plaignants. La d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019est pas ainsi libell\u00e9e. La Cour d\u2019appel avait souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019argument de l\u2019appelant, Dr Chopra, selon lequel il n\u2019y a aucune exigence l\u00e9gale dans la LCDP pour que la doctrine de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation soit invoqu\u00e9e afin de limiter l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire.\n[85] Compte tenu de sa comp\u00e9tence pour accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour toute perte de salaire, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour appliquer la doctrine de l\u2019att\u00e9nuation, mais il n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation de le faire.\n[86] Je refuse d\u2019exercer ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en faveur des intim\u00e9s et d\u2019imposer l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuation aux plaignants. Les plaignants sont victimes d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire, et non les intim\u00e9s. Il est \u00e9vident que les plaignants ont subi une perte de salaire. Pourtant, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, en raison de la Charte et du principe de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 restreinte, le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement r\u00e9duit des montants qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s.\n[87] Les intim\u00e9s demandent maintenant encore plus, dans le cas de Vilven, que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour sa perte de salaire soit de z\u00e9ro. Pour Kelly, ils demandent que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ne soit que de 50 p. 100. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019y a aucun fondement pour que le Tribunal accepte la demande des intim\u00e9s.\nVI. Pr\u00e9judices moraux A. Vilven [88] Vilven demande 20 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, le maximum pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont sa retraite oblig\u00e9e l\u2019a affect\u00e9 personnellement, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait de piloter avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 une importante partie de sa vie. La plupart de ses amis sont des pilotes qui travaillent toujours, mais il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de le faire.\n[89] Vilven a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les r\u00e9percussions sur sa vie personnelle \u00e9taient qu\u2019il avait pay\u00e9 un prix terrible pour le fait qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et qu\u2019il poursuivait sa plainte. Sa femme est extr\u00eamement d\u00e9\u00e7ue et attrist\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9. Il a perdu des amis de la famille. On lui a dit qu\u2019au souper de retraite \u00e0 Winnipeg pour les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada le 16 juin 2006, il y avait un mannequin qui le repr\u00e9sentait d\u2019une fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s peu flatteuse. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa femme aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9e si elle l\u2019avait vu, et qu\u2019il aurait aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 boulevers\u00e9, mais il ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au souper.\nB. Kelly [90] Kelly demande 20 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les r\u00e9percussions de la fin de son emploi aupr\u00e8s d\u2019Air Canada sur sa vie personnelle avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s difficiles. Il a perdu la camaraderie de beaucoup d\u2019amis. Il a perdu la capacit\u00e9 de rendre r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement visite \u00e0 son fils, qui habite \u00e0 Hong Kong, o\u00f9 il se rendait souvent pour le travail.\n[91] Kelly a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9 depuis l\u2019\u00e2ge de 16 ans et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait\u2011l\u00e0 de la premi\u00e8re fois dans sa vie o\u00f9 il ne travaillait pas. Il trouve cela tr\u00e8s dommageable pour sa dignit\u00e9 et son sens de la valeur personnelle, en particulier en raison du fait qu\u2019il a encore deux enfants dont il doit s\u2019occuper, un \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9 et l\u2019autre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole secondaire. Il doit se fier \u00e0 son \u00e9pouse pour gagner le salaire suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u00e9cessaire pour maintenir leur style de vie, alors qu\u2019il est tout \u00e0 fait en \u00e9tat de continuer \u00e0 travailler. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses relations avec ses amis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tendues.\nC. Conclusion sur le pr\u00e9judice moral [92] En ce qui a trait aux dommages de Vilven et de Kelly pour pr\u00e9judice moral, \u00e0 mon avis, ces demandes ne devraient pas \u00eatre accord\u00e9es. Ils demandent tous deux le maximum de 20 000 $ sans expliquer pourquoi ils ont droit au maximum. La jurisprudence du Tribunal indique clairement que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale est r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux pratiques discriminatoires les plus accablantes. Les faits pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les plaignants ne satisfont pas \u00e0 cette norme.\n[93] Plut\u00f4t, les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce militent contre toute indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. D\u00e8s le moment o\u00f9 Vilven et Kelly ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s \u00e0 Air Canada, ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien au courant de l\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite obligatoire de 60 ans. Pourtant, ils n\u2019ont rien fait pour contester cette disposition discriminatoire avant de prendre leur retraite d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans.\n[94] Au contraire, ils ont tir\u00e9 avantage de cette pratique discriminatoire en pouvant monter les \u00e9chelons plus rapidement en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, aux postes mieux r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9s, aux horaires mensuels pr\u00e9f\u00e9rables et aux horaires de vacances pr\u00e9f\u00e9rables. Il en \u00e9tait ainsi parce que les pilotes qui avaient plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qu\u2019eux avaient l\u2019obligation de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans.\n[95] Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente au sujet de la responsabilit\u00e9, les plaignants peuvent ne pas \u00eatre satisfaits du fait que leur carri\u00e8re de pilote si enrichissante aupr\u00e8s d\u2019Air Canada ait \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9e, mais la situation ne peut pas \u00eatre prise de fa\u00e7on isol\u00e9e. Elle doit \u00eatre examin\u00e9e dans le contexte d\u2019un syst\u00e8me qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu afin d\u2019attribuer des responsabilit\u00e9s et des avantages aux pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de leur carri\u00e8res. Tous les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada comprennent qu\u2019ils partageront ces avantages et ces fardeaux \u00e9galement aux \u00e9tapes appropri\u00e9es de leurs carri\u00e8res.\nVII. Indemnit\u00e9 pour acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 [96] Vilven et Kelly demandent aussi 20 000 $ contre chacun des intim\u00e9s, en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Ils soutiennent que les intim\u00e9s savaient tr\u00e8s bien qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucune cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9gative si les plaignants continuaient \u00e0 travailler pour Air Canada. Seul un petit ajustement \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire et les intim\u00e9s auraient pu acc\u00e9der \u00e0 cette demande en respectant les normes de l\u2019OACI.\n[97] Pourtant, les intim\u00e9s ont refus\u00e9 de le faire m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal ait conclu qu\u2019il y avait eu pratique discriminatoire. Cela d\u00e9montre, selon les plaignants, une insouciance totale envers les droits des pilotes plus \u00e2g\u00e9s en faveur des int\u00e9r\u00eats des pilotes moins \u00e2g\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, cela justifie un montant important en indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale.\nA. Conclusion sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 [98] Le paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP permet au Tribunal d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale lorsqu\u2019il est conclu que la personne a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment ou sans consid\u00e9ration. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la pratique discriminatoire des intim\u00e9s \u00e9tait le fait d\u2019appliquer la politique de la retraite obligatoire qui se trouve dans le R\u00e9gime de retraite et dans la convention collective qui, pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e il y a un certain temps lors du processus de convention collective entre Air Canada et l\u2019ACAP, qui repr\u00e9sentait les pilotes.\n[99] Ce n\u2019est que lorsque le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision en ao\u00fbt 2009 qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que la politique de retraite obligatoire \u00e9tait discriminatoire. Avant cette date, les intim\u00e9s avaient le droit de se fier, et ils se fiaient, aux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents \u00e9tablis selon lesquels une telle politique ne contrevenait pas \u00e0 la Charte ou aux lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Il \u00e9tait raisonnable que les intim\u00e9s appliquent cette politique, et le fait qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont appliqu\u00e9e ne peut pas signifier qu\u2019ils ont agi de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[100] La question qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 trancher est celle de savoir si les intim\u00e9s ont agi de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e en refusant de r\u00e9tablir imm\u00e9diatement les plaignants lorsque la politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e discriminatoire. \u00c0 mon avis, la r\u00e9ponse est non.\n[101] Le r\u00e9tablissement est l\u2019une des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es par les plaignants. Toutes les parties ont accept\u00e9 de diviser l\u2019audience entre la responsabilit\u00e9 et le redressement. Le r\u00e9tablissement ne d\u00e9coule pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9. De plus, m\u00eame si le Tribunal ordonnait le r\u00e9tablissement, il restait tout de m\u00eame \u00e0 trancher la question de la position des plaignants sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur cette question. Le fait que les intim\u00e9s ont attendu la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal au sujet du redressement ne constitue pas un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9.\nVIII. Autres d\u00e9penses [102] Vilven et Kelly ont tous deux demand\u00e9 des menues d\u00e9penses. Celles-ci sont d\u00e9taill\u00e9es \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce C\u201118. Les points 1 \u00e0 6 portent sur des d\u00e9penses pour les h\u00f4tels, les repas et les d\u00e9placements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 encourues pour la participation des plaignants \u00e0 l\u2019audience tant comme t\u00e9moins que comme observateurs.\nA. Conclusion sur les autres d\u00e9penses [103] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses d\u00e9coulant de la pratique discriminatoire. Dans la d\u00e9cision Warman c. Winnicki, [2006] D.C.D.P no 18, le Tribunal a conclu que le d\u00e9placement, l\u2019h\u00e9bergement et les d\u00e9penses pour les repas ne sont pas le type de d\u00e9penses vis\u00e9es par cet alin\u00e9a, parce qu\u2019elles ne sont pas directement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une affaire au Tribunal. Ce sont des d\u00e9penses indirectes. C\u2019\u00e9tait le cas m\u00eame si le plaignant dans Warman avait comparu comme t\u00e9moin et avait t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[104] Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 que l\u2019avocat dans Warman n\u2019avait pas pu pr\u00e9senter de jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour ces types de d\u00e9penses. Les plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce n\u2019ont pas non plus pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de jurisprudence \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leur position selon laquelle on devrait leur rembourser les d\u00e9penses encourues pour la participation \u00e0 l\u2019audience en tant que t\u00e9moins ou observateurs.\n[105] Les points 7, 8 et 9 portent sur une assurance-vie suppl\u00e9mentaire, un r\u00e9gime de soins m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaire pour la retraite et des co\u00fbts additionnels pour le r\u00e9gime de soins m\u00e9dicaux. Air Canada offrait ces avantages jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la retraite. Aucune preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quant \u00e0 savoir si les avantages \u00e9taient enti\u00e8rement financ\u00e9s par Air Canada ou s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de contributions des employ\u00e9s.\n[106] Les plaignants fondent leur demande sur le fait qu\u2019ils doivent maintenant financer enti\u00e8rement ces avantages. Cependant, les plaignants avaient l\u2019option de participer \u00e0 ces r\u00e9gimes. De plus, ils auraient pris leur retraite \u00e0 un certain moment dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9, et les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019ils demandent maintenant ont simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9g\u00e8rement acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9es. De toute fa\u00e7on, il n\u2019y a aucune justification pour les montants inscrits \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce C\u201118. Il en va de m\u00eame pour la demande de Vilven au point 16 concernant les frais de laissez-passer d\u2019Air Canada.\n[107] Quant aux points 10 \u00e0 15, les primes et l\u2019int\u00e9ressement, ces montants sont inclus dans les calculs d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019Air Canada et sont accueillis, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019un ajustement refl\u00e9tant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, seule l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour les points 10 \u00e0 15 est accord\u00e9e.\nIX. Le calcul d\u2019Air Canada et de l\u2019ACAP pour la perte de salaire et l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 [108] Pour d\u00e9terminer la perte de salaire et l\u2019anciennet\u00e9, Air Canada a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 diff\u00e9rents sc\u00e9narios. Le premier sc\u00e9nario est le suivant : Aucune indemnit\u00e9 avant le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009 (date de la deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision du Tribunal). Le deuxi\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario est le suivant : P\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e \u00e0 deux ans.\n[109] Les deux sc\u00e9narios tiennent compte du fait que Vilven et Kelly seraient r\u00e9tablis \u00e0 leur poste complet en date du 1er avril 2010. Une fois r\u00e9tablis, Vilven et Kelly recevraient le salaire et les avantages d\u2019un employ\u00e9 actif, qui comprendraient la cotisation continue au fonds de pension selon les m\u00eames conditions qu\u2019avant la retraite.\n[110] D\u2019apr\u00e8s le premier sc\u00e9nario, la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 serait du 1er septembre 2009 (soit le 1er mois complet suivant la deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cision du Tribunal) jusqu\u2019au 1er avril 2010. Aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne serait pay\u00e9e pour toute p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le 1er septembre 2009.\n[111] Air Canada et l\u2019ACAP sont d\u2019avis que, selon la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Hislop, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 429, s\u2019il est satisfait \u00e0 certains crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis dans cet arr\u00eat, aucune indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9troactive ne devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Cela est \u00e0 l\u2019oppos\u00e9 de la demande de Vilven et de Kelly, qui soutiennent que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 devrait courir de la date de leur retraite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de leur r\u00e9tablissement.\nA. Premier sc\u00e9nario : Aucune indemnit\u00e9 avant le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009 [112] Pour calculer la perte de salaire, il faut d\u2019abord d\u00e9terminer la position d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalente que Vilven et Kelly auraient occup\u00e9e au 1er septembre 2009. Air Canada est d\u2019avis que, pour faire preuve de coh\u00e9rence, si aucune indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019est accord\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode avant le 1er septembre 2009, de fa\u00e7on semblable, aucune anciennet\u00e9 ne devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e avant cette p\u00e9riode.\n(i) Vilven [113] Pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Vilven au 1er septembre 2009, Air Canada a suivi le raisonnement suivant. Dans le cas de Vilven, comme six ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre sa date de retraite et la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, six ans d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9duits des ann\u00e9es qui se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis sa date d\u2019embauche (exclusion).\n[114] Vilven a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 par Air Canada en mai 1986. Pour refl\u00e9ter l\u2019exclusion, Air Canada a ajout\u00e9 six ans \u00e0 la date d\u2019embauche de Vilven en mai 1986, lui donnant une [Traduction] date d\u2019embauche ajust\u00e9e de mai 1992. Comme aucun pilote n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 entre 1989 et 1993, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Vilven au 1er septembre 2009 serait le num\u00e9ro suivant celui du dernier pilote embauch\u00e9 en 1989. Air Canada a conclu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 du capitaine Di Stazio, dont le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 en 2009 \u00e9tait 1221. Par cons\u00e9quent, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent de Vilven serait 1222.\n[115] \u00c0 sa retraite, Vilven \u00e9tait un A340 PO YVR. Au 1er septembre 2009, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 1222 sur la liste d\u2019affectation des pilotes aurait permis \u00e0 un premier officier bas\u00e9 \u00e0 Vancouver d\u2019occuper un poste d\u2019A340 PO.\n[116] En appliquant le taux de base mensuel pour le salaire d\u2019un A340 PO pendant sept mois, en plus d\u2019un montant pour les primes et l\u2019int\u00e9ressement, ainsi que la pension pay\u00e9e, Air Canada a calcul\u00e9 la perte de salaire de Vilven, y compris les primes et l\u2019int\u00e9ressement pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er septembre 2009 au 31 mars 2010, au montant de 88 984 $. En d\u00e9duisant 39 036 $ pour le remboursement de la pension et 4 051 $ pour les cotisations de retraite n\u00e9cessaires, cela laisse une perte de salaire nette ou une indemnit\u00e9 d\u2019un montant de 45 897 $.\n(ii) Kelly [117] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Kelly, quatre ann\u00e9es et quatre mois se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre sa date de retraite et le 1er septembre 2009. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 en septembre 1972, son exclusion ou sa [traduction] date d\u2019embauche ajust\u00e9e serait janvier 1977. Son num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivalent en date du 1er septembre 2009 serait 176. Par cons\u00e9quent, il pourrait occuper le poste d\u2019un pilote B777 avec le taux de salaire le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. En utilisant la m\u00eame m\u00e9thode qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e pour Vilven, Air Canada a calcul\u00e9 que sa perte de salaire nette ou son indemnit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode serait de 62 711 $.\nB. Deuxi\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario : P\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e \u00e0 deux ans [118] Dans ce deuxi\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario, Vilven et Kelly n\u2019obtiendraient une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire que de deux ans, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les deux ans qui ont imm\u00e9diatement suivi leur date de retraite.\n[119] Ils seraient r\u00e9tablis en date du 1er avril 2010 et, apr\u00e8s leur r\u00e9tablissement, ils recevraient la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les avantages d\u2019un employ\u00e9 actif et continueraient de cotiser \u00e0 leur fonds de pension selon les m\u00eames conditions qu\u2019avant leur retraite.\n(i) Kelly [120] Dans ce sc\u00e9nario, Air Canada a calcul\u00e9 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire de Kelly pour la p\u00e9riode en question \u00e0 42 376 $. Ce montant est fond\u00e9 sur la perte de salaire et les primes et int\u00e9ressements de 384 891 $; moins le salaire provenant d\u2019autres sources, 65 825 $; moins le remboursement de la pension pay\u00e9e, 258 683 $; moins la cotisation requise au fonds de pension, 18 007 $.\n[121] Ce calcul a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 en prenant l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Kelly et en d\u00e9terminant les postes qu\u2019il aurait pu occuper entre le 1er mai 2005 et le 1er mai 2007. Il \u00e9tait haut sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, mais en raison des normes de l\u2019OACI, il ne pouvait piloter des vols internationaux que comme B777 PO de mai 2005 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 novembre 2006, et comme pilote B777 jusqu\u2019au 1er mai 2010.\n[122] Le salaire qu\u2019il aurait gagn\u00e9 \u00e9tait fond\u00e9 sur 81 heures de vol par mois et les taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pertinents pour le poste de B777 PO pour 2005 et 2006. Pour 2007, la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur une moyenne de son groupe de pairs. Cependant, il y avait tr\u00e8s peu de diff\u00e9rence entre la moyenne de salaire mensuel du groupe de pairs de 19 792 $ en 2007 et le salaire mensuel d\u2019un pilote B777 de 19 434 $ en d\u00e9cembre 2006. L\u2019utilisation de l\u2019analyse du groupe de pairs importait peu pour Kelly.\n(ii) Vilven [123] Selon ce sc\u00e9nario, Air Canada a utilis\u00e9 une analyse du groupe de pairs. Par contraste \u00e0 Vilven, qui a calcul\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait situ\u00e9 \u00e0 un poste de B744 PO YYZ \u00e0 sa retraite, le groupe de pairs pour Vilven \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9 de pilotes A340 YVR, le m\u00eame poste que Vilven occupait \u00e0 sa retraite, dont cinq pilotes occupaient les postes imm\u00e9diatement au-dessus de Vilven, et cinq, imm\u00e9diatement au-dessous de lui, sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 sa date de retraite. La r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension moyenne pour le groupe de pairs de dix pilotes a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode de septembre 2004 \u00e0 septembre 2005.\n[124] Air Canada a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse du groupe de pairs \u00e9tait plus appropri\u00e9e que celle de la cohorte de pilotes \u00e0 laquelle Vilven appartenait, parce que le groupe de 10 pilotes restait le m\u00eame pendant la p\u00e9riode d\u2019analyse. Tout choix individuel en termes de changement d\u2019\u00e9quipement, de statut ou de base aurait automatiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 refl\u00e9t\u00e9, tout comme la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, sans avoir \u00e0 prendre des d\u00e9cisions hypoth\u00e9tiques quant au moment o\u00f9 un pilote exercerait les diverses options auxquelles il a droit en vertu de la convention collective. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019approche de Vilven par cohorte de pilotes, il y avait un changement de poste chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[125] Air Canada est d\u2019avis que l\u2019analyse du groupe de pairs n\u00e9cessite moins de jugement, parce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9bute avec Vilven et son poste au moment de sa retraite et suit le groupe de pairs \u00e0 partir de cette date. Elle est fond\u00e9e sur des d\u00e9cisions r\u00e9elles, plut\u00f4t que sur des hypoth\u00e8ses de ce qui aurait pu se produire. Le groupe de pairs avait une anciennet\u00e9 semblable \u00e0 celle de Vilven, qui avait aussi l\u2019option de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour la base \u00e0 Toronto et de devenir un premier officier sur un B767, et ils ne l\u2019ont pas fait.\n[126] Air Canada a calcul\u00e9 que la perte de revenu de Vilven pour ces deux ann\u00e9es \u00e9tait de 178 989 $, y compris la perte de salaire ainsi que de primes et d\u2019int\u00e9ressement de 337 807 $; moins le salaire d\u2019att\u00e9nuation de 15 767 $; moins le remboursement de pension de 126 770 $; moins la cotisation au fonds de pension de 16 281 $.\n[127] Air Canada tente de fonder la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 de deux ans sur le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert d\u2019Alexandra Leslie. Selon Mme Leslie, si le r\u00e9gime de pension avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 afin de retirer l\u2019obligation de retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans, la moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite de deux ans aurait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l\u2019augmentation pr\u00e9vue.\n[128] Elle a soulign\u00e9 que la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada prennent leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans. Si l\u2019obligation de retraite \u00e9tait retir\u00e9e, elle s\u2019attendait \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un grand nombre de pilotes continuent de prendre leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans simplement parce que la politique est en place depuis si longtemps. Du point de vue de la planification individuelle, une personne a tendance \u00e0 se fier \u00e0 la politique et il faudra un certain temps pour que l\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite de fait s\u2019\u00e9loigne du 60 ans.\n[129] Il est int\u00e9ressant de noter qu\u2019il y a une grande similitude entre l\u2019analyse de cohorte de Vilven et l\u2019analyse du groupe de pairs d\u2019Air Canada. Elles utilisent toutes deux dix pilotes, cinq qui ont plus d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que Vilven et cinq qui en ont moins. Elles utilisent toutes deux le poste de A340 pour la p\u00e9riode de 2005. La diff\u00e9rence fondamentale en ce qui a trait au montant pour la p\u00e9riode de deux ans est attribuable \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre le taux de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration d\u2019un B747 PO et celui d\u2019un A340 en 2003 et en 2004.\nC. Conclusion sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire [130] Les plaignants soutiennent que les seuls facteurs limitant leur demande d\u2019indemnisation pour la p\u00e9riode de leur retraite jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur r\u00e9tablissement sont qu\u2019il doit exister un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre leur demande et la pratique discriminatoire, et que leurs efforts d\u2019att\u00e9nuation doivent \u00eatre raisonnables. (Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), [2007] A.C.F. 1134).\n[131] Les intim\u00e9s soutiennent qu\u2019il y a un autre facteur limitant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9, soit la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Hislop, 2007 CSC 10. Selon l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop, le Tribunal ne devrait pas accorder une mesure de redressement r\u00e9troactive, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il ne devrait pas accorder d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode avant le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009.\n[132] Les plaignants ne sont pas d\u2019avis que l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop a cet effet. L\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame Nova Scotia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Martin, [2003] 2 R.C.S. 504, montre clairement que, sauf les facteurs limitants \u00e9tablis ci-dessus, le Tribunal a la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019indemnisation compl\u00e8te pour rendre des ordonnances tant pour l\u2019avenir que pour le pass\u00e9.\n[133] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin, il y avait deux appelants. L\u2019appelant, Martin, avait subi une blessure en milieu de travail en f\u00e9vrier 1996, \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9 au travail plusieurs fois, mais avait finalement eu \u00e0 quitter le travail. La Workers\u2019 Compensation Board (WBC) (Commission des accidents du travail) lui avait accord\u00e9 des prestations temporaires d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9adaptation. Lorsque ces prestations se sont termin\u00e9es en ao\u00fbt 1996, il a demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le de la d\u00e9cision, mais sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la WCB.\n[134] L\u2019autre appelante, Laseur, avait aussi subi une blessure en milieu de travail, avait re\u00e7u des prestations temporaires d\u2019invalidit\u00e9, avait tent\u00e9 de retourner au travail, mais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de le faire. Elle a demand\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour incapacit\u00e9 permanente partielle et une aide sous forme de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle. Les deux demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es.\n[135] Les deux appelants ont port\u00e9 ces d\u00e9cisions en appel au Tribunal d\u2019appel de la WCB, et Martin a soutenu que l\u2019article 10B et certaines des r\u00e8gles de la Workers\u2019 Compensation Act contrevenaient au paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte. Le Tribunal d\u2019appel a conclu que la loi contrevenait \u00e0 la Charte et que Martin avait droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9 temporaire pour perte de salaire et \u00e0 des soins m\u00e9dicaux jusqu\u2019en octobre 1996. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a renvers\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision et l\u2019affaire est mont\u00e9e jusqu\u2019en Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[136] La principale question que la Cour supr\u00eame devait trancher \u00e9tait celle de savoir si le Tribunal d\u2019appel avait la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019appliquer la Charte. La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le Tribunal d\u2019appel avait cette comp\u00e9tence et qu\u2019il avait correctement conclu que la loi contest\u00e9e contrevenait \u00e0 la Charte. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Cour supr\u00eame a ordonn\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal d\u2019appel soit maintenue et que Martin re\u00e7oive les avantages qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9s.\n[137] Quant \u00e0 Laseur, le Tribunal d\u2019appel a refus\u00e9 de lui accorder les avantages qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9s parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas contest\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de la loi applicable. La Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer l\u2019affaire au Tribunal d\u2019appel pour qu\u2019il tranche la question de la Charte si elle la soulevait et qu\u2019il rende une d\u00e9cision au sujet de son droit aux avantages demand\u00e9s en tenant compte de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame.\n[138] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin, la Cour supr\u00eame a tranch\u00e9 trois questions. Premi\u00e8rement, elle a conclu que le Tribunal d\u2019appel avait comp\u00e9tence pour trancher des questions relatives \u00e0 la Charte et portant sur les dispositions de sa loi habilitante; deuxi\u00e8mement, que les dispositions vis\u00e9es violaient le paragraphe 15(1) de la Charte et n\u2019\u00e9taient pas sauvegard\u00e9es par l\u2019article premier; et troisi\u00e8mement, que les mesures de redressement constitutionnelles que le Tribunal d\u2019appel pouvait accorder se limitaient \u00e0 faire fi des dispositions contest\u00e9es et \u00e0 trancher la demande du demandeur comme si ces dispositions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas en vigueur. La Cour supr\u00eame n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de la question de savoir \u00e0 quel moment une indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9troactive devait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e.\n[139] Que ce soit parce que le Tribunal d\u2019appel n\u2019a pas appliqu\u00e9 les dispositions ou que la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient inop\u00e9rantes, le r\u00e9sultat pour l\u2019appelant Martin a \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00eame. Il a obtenu les avantages r\u00e9troactifs qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9s parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait plus de fondement l\u00e9gal pour lui refuser.\n[140] La situation de Vilven et Kelly est diff\u00e9rente. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la question de la Charte \u00e9tait que l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la LCDP ne pouvait \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fense par les intim\u00e9s. Cependant, cette conclusion n\u2019a entra\u00een\u00e9 aucune mesure de redressement. Elle ne fonctionnait pas de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que la d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Martin. Elle n\u2019accordait aux plaignants aucune mesure de redressement. C\u2019est ce que le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer.\n[141] Les faits dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop sont les suivants. Pour pouvoir obtenir une pension de survivant en vertu du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (le RPC), le survivant devait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9 au cotisant ou avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 un conjoint de fait du sexe oppos\u00e9 en relation conjugale au moment du d\u00e9c\u00e8s du cotisant.\n[142] S\u2019il \u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9, le survivant pouvait pr\u00e9senter une demande de pension de survivant qui lui serait payable \u00e0 chaque mois apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du cotisant. Si la demande n\u2019\u00e9tait pas re\u00e7ue dans les 12 mois suivant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du cotisant, les arr\u00e9rages qui pouvaient \u00eatre demand\u00e9s \u00e9taient limit\u00e9s aux 12 mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la r\u00e9ception de la demande.\n[143] En 2000, apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat M v. H, [1999] 2 R.C.S 3, le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a modifi\u00e9 le RPC pour que les avantages de survivant soient accord\u00e9s aux partenaires de m\u00eame sexe, en changeant la d\u00e9finition de conjoint de fait afin qu\u2019il n\u2019y ait aucune mention du sexe du partenaire.\n[144] En plus de cette modification, les paragraphes 44(1.1), 72(1) et 72(2) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s au RPC. Selon le paragraphe 44(1.1), un survivant de m\u00eame sexe ne pouvait pas obtenir de pension de survivant s\u2019il \u00e9tait devenu survivant le 1er janvier 1998 ou apr\u00e8s cette date. Le paragraphe 72(2) emp\u00eachait le paiement d\u2019une pension de survivant pour tous les mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant juillet 2000, peu importe le moment auquel le partenaire de m\u00eame sexe est devenu admissible \u00e0 la pension.\n[145] L\u2019effet de cette disposition \u00e9tait d\u2019interdire tout avantage r\u00e9troactif de survivant aux survivants de m\u00eame sexe, y compris la possibilit\u00e9 de demander des arr\u00e9rages de pension de 12 mois, que les survivants de sexe oppos\u00e9 pouvaient obtenir en application du paragraphe 72(1). Le paragraphe 72(2) a pris fin en juin 2001, parce que depuis cette date, les partenaires de m\u00eame sexe et de sexe oppos\u00e9 sont trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on en application du paragraphe 72(1).\n[146] L\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop \u00e9tait un recours collectif d\u2019un groupe qui \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que les survivants de m\u00eame sexe dont le conjoint cotisant \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le 17 avril 1985 devaient avoir droit \u00e0 des avantages r\u00e9troactifs jusqu\u2019au mois suivant le d\u00e9c\u00e8s du conjoint de m\u00eame sexe.\n[147] La Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que les paragraphes 44(1.1) et 72(2) contrevenaient \u00e0 la Charte et elle a ensuite examin\u00e9 la question de la mesure de redressement appropri\u00e9e. Au d\u00e9part, la Cour a not\u00e9 que, lorsque la disposition contest\u00e9e est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inconstitutionnelle, le r\u00e9sultat en vertu du paragraphe 52(1) de la Charte \u00e9tait l\u2019annulation du texte l\u00e9gislatif d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part. Dans un tel cas, les cours accordent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement des mesures de redressement r\u00e9troactives.\n[148] Cependant, lorsque la loi change en raison d\u2019une intervention judiciaire, il peut \u00eatre appropri\u00e9 pour une cour de limiter l\u2019effet r\u00e9troactif de son jugement, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019elle applique le principe de l\u2019immunit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e. Selon ce principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de droit public, en l\u2019absence de comportement clairement fautif, de mauvaise foi ou d\u2019abus de pouvoir, les tribunaux n\u2019accorderont pas de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour le pr\u00e9judice subi \u00e0 cause de la simple adoption ou application d\u2019une loi subs\u00e9quemment d\u00e9clar\u00e9e inconstitutionnelle. (Voir Makin et Guimond c. Qu\u00e9bec, [1996] 3 R.C.S 347, au paragraphe 78).\n[149] Pour que soit justifi\u00e9e une mesure de redressement pour l\u2019avenir seulement, la Cour supr\u00eame exigeait que le crit\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire d\u2019une modification fondamentale du droit soit satisfait. Lorsqu\u2019il est satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re, d\u2019autres facteurs tels que l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable, la bonne foi, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties et le respect du r\u00f4le du l\u00e9gislateur doivent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s.\n[150] Pour la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop, la modification fondamentale du droit \u00e9tait survenue dans la d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat M. c. H., que la Cour supr\u00eame a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un \u00e9cart marqu\u00e9 de la jurisprudence existante sur les droits d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 de conjoints du m\u00eame sexe. Avant l\u2019arr\u00eat M. c. H., la Cour supr\u00eame avait conclu que la Constitution n\u2019exigeait pas d\u2019avantages \u00e9gaux pour les couples de m\u00eame sexe.\n[151] Quant aux autres facteurs, la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le fait de refuser des avantages aux conjoints de m\u00eame sexe en application de l\u2019ancien RPC \u00e9tait raisonnable compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9tat pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de la jurisprudence en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 fond\u00e9e sur le paragraphe 15(1). Le gouvernement n\u2019avait pas agi de mauvaise foi en n\u2019accordant pas aux survivants de m\u00eame sexe les avantages du RPC avant l\u2019arr\u00eat M. c. H. Le fait d\u2019imposer une responsabilit\u00e9 pour le paiement d\u2019arr\u00e9rages qui pourraient remonter aussi loin qu\u2019en 1985, en l\u2019absence de mauvaise foi, d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation d\u00e9raisonnable ou de comportement fautif, minerait l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre la protection des droits constitutionnels et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 gouvernementale.\n[152] \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal du 28 ao\u00fbt 2009 repr\u00e9sente une modification fondamentale de l\u2019\u00e9tat existant du droit. Avant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, les employeurs pouvaient avoir recours \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) pour une demande pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la LCDP et selon laquelle une politique de retraite obligatoire \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[153] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada, depuis l\u2019arr\u00eat McKinney, a toujours conclu que les dispositions l\u00e9gales permettant la retraite obligatoire pouvaient se justifier en vertu de l\u2019article premier de la Charte (voir McKinney c. Universit\u00e9 de Guelph, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 229; Harrison c. Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie\u2011Britannique, [1990] 3 R.C.S 451; Dickason c. Universit\u00e9 de l\u2019Alberta [1992] 2 R.C.S. 1103; Stoffman c. Vancouver General Hospital, [1990] 3 R.C.S. 483).\n[154] \u00c0 l\u2019exception de la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour du banc de la Reine du Manitoba CKY\u2011TV c. C.EP. Local 816, 252, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans Vilven et Kelly, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et les arbitres ont accept\u00e9 que cette disposition constituait une d\u00e9fense valable.\n[155] En ce qui a trait aux autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 examiner, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation raisonnable, la bonne foi et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties, comme la Cour supr\u00eame l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop, l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation constitutionnelle qui permet de d\u00e9terminer, dans les cas qui s\u2019y pr\u00eatent, le moment o\u00f9 la r\u00e8gle de droit a chang\u00e9 facilite la protection des justifiables et des l\u00e9gislatures qui sont fi\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019ancienne r\u00e8gle de droit lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019appliquait. De la sorte, un \u00e9quilibre s\u2019\u00e9tablit entre la confiance l\u00e9gitime des d\u00e9cideurs que leur action s\u2019appuie sur une \u00e9valuation raisonnable du droit au moment consid\u00e9r\u00e9 et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server la capacit\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9volution de la jurisprudence constitutionnelle.\n[156] Compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9tat du droit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les intim\u00e9s ont agi de bonne foi et de fa\u00e7on raisonnable en appliquant la politique de retraite obligatoire aux plaignants. Quant aux facteurs de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties, \u00e0 mon avis, un \u00e9quilibre juste est \u00e9tabli, d\u2019une part en n\u2019imposant pas aux intim\u00e9s le fardeau des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour une politique qui \u00e9tait l\u00e9gale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et, d\u2019autre part, en accordant des indemnit\u00e9s aux plaignants \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 la politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e ill\u00e9gale.\n[157] Je conclus que l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que les plaignants ne devraient pas obtenir d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire avant le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009. Cela \u00e9tant, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de trancher la position alternative des intim\u00e9s selon laquelle la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre limit\u00e9e aux deux ans suivant la date de la retraite des plaignants.\nD. Conclusion sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 [158] Il est bien \u00e9tabli en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne que l\u2019objectif d\u2019accorder une mesure de redressement est d\u2019indemniser la victime de discrimination dans les circonstances appropri\u00e9es. Cela laisse entendre que Vilven et Kelly devraient obtenir l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qu\u2019ils auraient accumul\u00e9e s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas pris leur retraite, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il n\u2019existe une raison de diminuer leur anciennet\u00e9.\n[159] En fonction des calculs des plaignants, tels que d\u00e9taill\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de Vilven \u00e0 son r\u00e9tablissement en 2010 serait le 751, et celui de Kelly serait le 5. Les intim\u00e9s, se fondant sur l\u2019exclusion, ont conclu que les plaignants devraient revenir au travail avec le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 1222 dans le cas de Vilven et 176 dans le cas de Kelly.\n[160] Pour arriver \u00e0 cette conclusion, les intim\u00e9s suivent la logique suivante. Premi\u00e8rement, ils soutiennent que dans le monde des pilotes, la convention collective est fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et cela a des r\u00e9percussions sur la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. \u00c0 mesure qu\u2019un pilote avance en anciennet\u00e9, il aura la capacit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature pour travailler avec de l\u2019\u00e9quipement de plus haute cat\u00e9gorie, qui lui rapportera un salaire plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[161] Par cons\u00e9quent, les intim\u00e9s soutiennent que si l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, alors l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop devrait s\u2019appliquer. Le fait de permettre aux plaignants d\u2019accumuler de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 avant le 28 ao\u00fbt 2009 serait contraire au principe selon lequel les intim\u00e9s peuvent se fonder sur la loi telle qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait avant la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\n[162] Cependant, comme la preuve le d\u00e9montre, l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 d\u00e9termine aussi les avantages autres que la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration. Par exemple, la position du pilote (l\u2019\u00e9quipement, le statut et la base), les horaires mensuels, les horaires de vacances, les conditions de travail et les mises \u00e0 pied sont tous li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019anciennet\u00e9.\n[163] L\u2019anciennet\u00e9 donne aux pilotes des choix de vie. Certains peuvent se priver de la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour rester \u00e0 une base qu\u2019ils pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent ou pour obtenir de meilleurs horaires mensuels ou horaires de vacances. L\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop ne traitait pas de la question de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9troactive. Si l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 ne peut pas \u00eatre exclusivement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, alors l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop ne devrait pas s\u2019appliquer.\n[164] De plus, en limitant l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9troactive, l\u2019arr\u00eat Hislop exige que le Tribunal tienne compte de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les parties. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019\u00e9quilibre en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 est en faveur des plaignants. Les plaignants sont deux personnes. Aucune preuve ne permet de conclure que leur r\u00e9tablissement au niveau d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qu\u2019ils d\u00e9clarent aurait un effet n\u00e9gatif sur les activit\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019ACAP, le fait d\u2019accorder l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 Vilven et \u00e0 Kelly ne constitue pas pour eux un avancement. Ils ne font que maintenir leur position d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 comme s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas pris leur retraite. Certains membres de l\u2019ACAP peuvent \u00eatre insatisfaits, mais comme le Tribunal l\u2019a not\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, cela ne ferait que retarder la progression de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes plus jeunes.\n[165] Pour ces motifs, j\u2019ai conclu que Vilven et Kelly devraient \u00eatre r\u00e9tablis avec le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 751 dans le cas de Vilven et le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 5 dans le cas de Kelly.\nE. Les avantages financiers pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019obligation de retraite [166] Les intim\u00e9s demandent que toute indemnit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Vilven ou \u00e0 Kelly soient r\u00e9duites afin de refl\u00e9ter le fait que leur carri\u00e8re a progress\u00e9 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9e dans un environnement de travail o\u00f9 la retraite obligatoire s\u2019appliquait. Les pilotes actuels et pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents, tels que Vilven et Kelly, ont tir\u00e9 avantage du fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t et qu\u2019ils ont obtenu des promotions plus rapidement en raison de l\u2019existence de l\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite obligatoire.\n[167] Ils soutiennent que Vilven et Kelly ont la libert\u00e9 de travailler tant qu\u2019ils sont qualifi\u00e9s, sans endurer de d\u00e9lai de compensation. La question est donc la suivante : le fait que Vilven et Kelly n\u2019ont pas subi de d\u00e9lai de compensation dans la progression de leur carri\u00e8re devrait-il \u00eatre un facteur dans la d\u00e9termination de leur indemnit\u00e9? En d\u2019autres mots, devraient-ils obtenir les avantages sans en payer le prix?\n[168] Air Canada a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son t\u00e9moin expert, Mme Leslie, de chiffrer l\u2019avantage financier pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. Elle a reconnu qu\u2019un tel exercice serait hypoth\u00e9tique, parce qu\u2019il d\u00e9pend en grande partie de l\u2019\u00e2ge moyen des pilotes en l\u2019absence de l\u2019obligation de retraite, qui est inconnu.\n[169] Mme Leslie a suppos\u00e9 que, si la moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge augmentait de deux ans, les pilotes actuels auraient eu l\u2019avantage d\u2019une acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration de carri\u00e8re de deux ans. Les seuls faits qu\u2019elle a pu pr\u00e9senter sur cette question \u00e9taient que la moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite dans le r\u00e9gime des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada est 59,2 ans, et que la grande majorit\u00e9 des pilotes prennent leur retraite \u00e0 leur date normale de retraite. Ce qui est inconnu est la question de savoir, si l\u2019obligation de retraite \u00e9tait retir\u00e9e, combien de pilotes prendraient tout de m\u00eame leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans et combien d\u2019entre eux prendraient leur retraite plus tard, \u00e0 quel \u00e2ge, dans l\u2019avenir?\n[170] Mme Leslie a conclu que, en supposant que la moyenne d\u2019\u00e2ge de retraite \u00e9tait retard\u00e9e de deux ans, et compte tenu de la moyenne finale de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration ouvrant droit \u00e0 pension de Kelly de 224 000 $, une approximation raisonnable de l\u2019avantage financier qu\u2019il a obtenu en raison de l\u2019existence de l\u2019obligation de retraite serait d\u2019environ 450 000 $. Pour Vilven, dont la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration moyenne finale \u00e9tait de 167 000 $, en supposant une diff\u00e9rence de deux ans, Mme Leslie a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait tir\u00e9 un avantage d\u2019environ 334 000 $.\n[171] Mme Leslie a reconnu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait-l\u00e0 seulement d\u2019une approximation et que sa tentative de chiffrer l\u2019avantage avait des faiblesses. Elle a aussi reconnu qu\u2019elle ne sugg\u00e9rait pas que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 des plaignants soit r\u00e9duite en fonction de ces montants, mais seulement que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 devait \u00eatre r\u00e9duite. Air Canada a laiss\u00e9 au Tribunal la charge de calculer la d\u00e9duction.\nF. Conclusion sur l\u2019avantage financier pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent [172] Cet argument comporte des lacunes. M\u00eame si l\u2019on supposait qu\u2019il y avait eu un avantage financier, le fondement pour chiffrer le montant est tr\u00e8s faible. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019impressions plut\u00f4t que de faits. De plus, si la d\u00e9duction doit \u00eatre de moins de 100 p. 100, quelle devrait-elle \u00eatre? En l\u2019absence d\u2019une formule de la part des intim\u00e9s, il ne revient pas au Tribunal de supposer.\n[173] Enfin, \u00e0 mon avis, les intim\u00e9s exag\u00e8rent beaucoup en demandant cette diminution. En tentant de faire appliquer la r\u00e8gle Hislop, les intim\u00e9s ont r\u00e9ellement r\u00e9duit l\u2019indemnisation des plaignants d\u2019environ six ans et quatre ans respectivement, ce qui est beaucoup plus que les deux ans que Mme Leslie sugg\u00e9rait. Leur demande d\u2019une r\u00e9duction suppl\u00e9mentaire est rejet\u00e9e.\nX. Ordonnance [174] Le Tribunal ordonne :\nLes intim\u00e9s doivent cesser d\u2019appliquer l\u2019article 5.1 du R\u00e9gime de pension des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada ainsi que les dispositions correspondantes de la convention collective envers les plaignants; Les plaignants doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9tablis dans leur emploi comme pilotes au sein d\u2019Air Canada en date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision \u00e0 condition qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une licence de pilote valide, un certificat m\u00e9dical valide montrant qu\u2019ils sont en \u00e9tat de piloter un a\u00e9ronef commercial conform\u00e9ment aux normes m\u00e9dicales applicables de Transports Canada et une qualification de vol aux instruments \u00e0 jour; D\u00e8s leur r\u00e9tablissement, les plaignants doivent \u00eatre inscrits au prochain cours de formation disponible pour l\u2019\u00e9quipement qu\u2019ils ont le droit de piloter en fonction de leur anciennet\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019ils auront termin\u00e9 avec succ\u00e8s cette formation, ils seront inscrits \u00e0 l\u2019horaire de pilotage d\u00e8s la prochaine occasion d\u2019appels d\u2019offre mensuels et ils devront \u00eatre plac\u00e9s sur la liste de postes des pilotes; D\u00e8s leur r\u00e9tablissement, Vilven doit avoir le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 751 et Kelly, le num\u00e9ro d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 5 sur la liste d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 des pilotes; D\u00e8s leur r\u00e9tablissement, les plaignants doivent recevoir le salaire et les avantages d\u2019un employ\u00e9 actif, y compris la contribution continue aux fins de pension, selon les m\u00eames conditions qu\u2019avant leur retraite; Les plaignants doivent \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9s par les intim\u00e9s pour la perte de salaire pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er septembre 2009 \u00e0 la date de leur r\u00e9tablissement en tant qu\u2019employ\u00e9s actifs. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e en fonction du salaire mensuel du poste pour 81 heures de vol par mois, dont la moiti\u00e9 doit \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e au taux de jour et la moiti\u00e9 au taux de nuit, en plus de la prime pour le service outre-mer de 71 heures. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 comprendra toute prime et int\u00e9ressement pay\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Vilven aura une indemnit\u00e9 calcul\u00e9e au taux de salaire de A340 PO et Kelly, au taux de salaire de pilote B777 jusqu\u2019au 30 avril 2010 et, par la suite, au taux de salaire d\u2019un B777 PO; Les montants des prestations de retraite pay\u00e9es aux plaignants du 1er septembre 2009 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur date de r\u00e9tablissement seront d\u00e9duits de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire; Les intim\u00e9s doivent payer de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sur le montant net de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 partir du 1er septembre 2009 jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 soit pay\u00e9e. Le montant de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sera calcul\u00e9 en fonction de la base \u00e9tablie par Mme Leslie dans son rapport d\u2019expert (pi\u00e8ce AC\u201113, modifi\u00e9e par la pi\u00e8ce AC\u201113A) et que les plaignants ont accept\u00e9. Air Canada doit payer 50 p. 100 et l\u2019ACAP doit payer 50 p. 100 de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 nette, ainsi que de la prime et de l\u2019int\u00e9ressement, et les int\u00e9r\u00eats payables.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJ.

Lustig Date : Le 9 novembre 2010 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2010 TCDP 28\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision concernant la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance portant que la cause des plaignants en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce soit ajourn\u00e9e sine die ou, subsidiairement, jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011, en attendant l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113 qu\u2019\u00e9tudie actuellement la Chambre des communes.\n[2] Les plaignants, qui sont fr\u00e8res et s\u0153urs, ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 chacun une plainte quasi identique, all\u00e9guant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur endroit en leur refusant le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits comme Indien dans le registre des Indiens en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens. Les plaintes, sign\u00e9es le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2008, all\u00e8guent que le d\u00e9ni du droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit comme Indien est une pratique discriminatoire fond\u00e9e \u00e0 la fois sur [Traduction] [\u2026] les motifs de distinction illicite que sont la situation de famille et le sexe sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[3] Pour les besoins de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, il suffit de d\u00e9crire comme suit la situation des plaignants :\nles plaignants sont tous n\u00e9s avant 1985. Ils ont un grand-parent indien : une femme qui avait perdu son statut en \u00e9pousant un non-Indien avant 1985 et qui l\u2019a r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)c) de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adoption des modifications apport\u00e9es par le projet de loi C\u201131 en 1985. Aux termes de ces m\u00eames modifications, les enfants issus de son mariage avec un non\u2011Indien (dont un \u00e9tait le p\u00e8re des plaignants) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9put\u00e9s avoir droit au statut en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) de la Loi sur les Indiens. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les modifications apport\u00e9es en 1985 n\u2019accordaient le statut d\u2019Indien qu\u2019\u00e0 leur p\u00e8re en vertu du paragraphe 6(2) et que la m\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9tait pas indienne, les plaignants n\u2019ont jamais eu droit au statut. De ce fait, les enfants qu\u2019ils ont eus avec des non\u2011Indiens depuis 1985 n\u2019y ont pas droit non plus ; les plaignants ont \u00e9tabli et produit un tableau qui illustre les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de leur famille et de leur statut par rapport \u00e0 des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux hypoth\u00e9tiques qui sont identiques en tous points, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du sexe de leur grand-parent indien. Autrement dit, dans les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux hypoth\u00e9tiques, leur grand-parent indien est de sexe masculin, et non f\u00e9minin. Dans les deux sc\u00e9narios, les dates de naissance, de mariage et de d\u00e9c\u00e8s sont toutes les m\u00eames. Comme le montre le tableau, dans le sc\u00e9nario patrilin\u00e9aire hypoth\u00e9tique, les plaignants auraient le statut d\u2019Indien en vertu du paragraphe 6(1) de la Loi sur les Indiens et pourraient transmettre \u00e0 leurs enfants le statut que conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 6(2) ; les plaignants all\u00e8guent que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement, qui d\u00e9coule d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de discrimination figurant dans la Loi sur les Indiens, a deux grands effets n\u00e9gatifs : premi\u00e8rement, ils sont eux-m\u00eames priv\u00e9s du statut, ainsi que des avantages qui en d\u00e9coulent ; deuxi\u00e8mement, ils sont priv\u00e9s de la possibilit\u00e9 de transmettre le statut \u00e0 leurs enfants.\n[4] Le 9 novembre 2009, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes dont il est question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce au pr\u00e9sent Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 49 de la LCDP, pour audition.\n[5] Le 6 avril 2009, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans l\u2019affaire McIvor c. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs) (l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor), d\u00e9clarant que les alin\u00e9as 6(1)a) et c) de la Loi sur les Indiens sont inop\u00e9rants car ils violent tous deux le droit du demandeur, garanti \u00e0 l\u2019article 15 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s (la Charte), et que la violation n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e par l\u2019article premier de la Charte. La Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a suspendu son jugement d\u00e9claratoire pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an et a par la suite prolong\u00e9 la suspension \u00e0 deux reprises : la seconde a eu lieu le 5 juillet 2010, jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011, afin que le Parlement ait le temps voulu pour passer en revue et examiner de nouvelles modifications \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[6] L\u2019affaire McIvor avait trait \u00e0 la constitutionnalit\u00e9 de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, lequel \u00e9tablit le droit qu\u2019a une personne d\u2019\u00eatre inscrite comme Indien. C\u2019est cette m\u00eame disposition qui est en litige dans les plaintes soumises au Tribunal, car les plaignants contestent le fait que l\u2019office du Registre des Indiens (l\u2019ORI) refuse de les inscrire comme Indiens, malgr\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor.\n[7] Dans l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel du droit, les plaignants n\u2019ont pas le droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrits, et l\u2019ORI ne peut inscrire une personne que si celle-ci satisfait aux exigences l\u00e9gales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription. Donnant suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor, la Couronne a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le projet de loi C\u20113, intitul\u00e9 Loi favorisant l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 entre les sexes relativement \u00e0 l\u2019inscription au registre des Indiens en donnant suite \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique dans l\u2019affaire McIvor c. Canada (Registrar Of Indian and Northern Affairs), et il est actuellement \u00e9tudi\u00e9 au Parlement.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate le 7 avril 2010, demandant que l\u2019on ajourne l\u2019instruction de ces questions. La Commission et les plaignants ont tous deux d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et ont souscrit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en ajournement. Par une lettre transmise aux parties en date du 20 mars 2010, le Tribunal a convenu d\u2019ajourner l\u2019instance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une date figurant en juillet 2010, \u00e0 laquelle aurait lieu une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique tenue dans le cadre de la gestion de l\u2019instance pour faire le point sur la situation.\n[9] \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qui a eu lieu le 6 juillet 2010, les parties ont discut\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat du projet de loi C\u20113, dont le fait que celui-ci n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore adopt\u00e9 et que les travaux de la Chambre des communes, o\u00f9 le projet de loi en \u00e9tait encore au stade de l\u2019\u00e9tude en comit\u00e9, \u00e9taient ajourn\u00e9s jusqu\u2019au 20 septembre 2010. Les parties ont \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 du fait que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique avait accord\u00e9 une prorogation jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011 afin de permettre au Parlement de modifier la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e0 la suite de la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019elle avait rendue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor.\n[10] Voici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la mani\u00e8re dont le projet de loi C\u20113 a \u00e9volu\u00e9 depuis son introduction :\nle projet de loi C\u20113 a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re lecture \u00e0 la Chambre des communes le 11 mars 2010, et en deuxi\u00e8me lecture le 29 mars suivant ; apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me lecture, le projet de loi C\u20113 a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 au Comit\u00e9 permanent des affaires autochtones et du d\u00e9veloppement du Grand Nord (le Comit\u00e9) pour qu\u2019il l\u2019\u00e9tudie et l\u2019analyse plus en d\u00e9tail. Un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins qui ont comparu devant le Comit\u00e9 ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 leur avis le texte de loi, tel qu\u2019\u00e9bauch\u00e9, ne ferait pas dispara\u00eetre l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment r\u00e9siduel de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont fait express\u00e9ment \u00e9tat du maintien de la m\u00eame diff\u00e9rence de traitement que les plaignants soulignent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ; apr\u00e8s avoir pris en consid\u00e9ration les expos\u00e9s des t\u00e9moins et examin\u00e9 le texte de loi article par article, le Comit\u00e9 a convenu de pr\u00e9senter ses conclusions sur le projet de loi C\u20113 \u00e0 la Chambre des communes en les assortissant de divers amendements ; apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation des conclusions sur le projet de loi C\u20113 \u00e0 la Chambre des communes, le secr\u00e9taire parlementaire du leader du gouvernement a soulev\u00e9 une objection, faisant valoir que les amendements sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e9tendaient irr\u00e9guli\u00e8rement la port\u00e9e du projet de loi. Le 11 mai 2010, le pr\u00e9sident de la Chambre des communes a d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9 que les amendements sugg\u00e9r\u00e9s par le Comit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 2 du projet de loi C\u20113 exc\u00e9daient la port\u00e9e que la Chambre avait fix\u00e9e pour ce dernier en deuxi\u00e8me lecture, et que ces amendements \u00e9taient donc inadmissibles et nuls. Il a ordonn\u00e9 de plus que le projet de loi C\u20113 soit r\u00e9imprim\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il concorde avec sa d\u00e9cision ; m\u00eame si le rapport du Comit\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet d\u2019autres discussions \u00e0 la Chambre des communes le 25 mai 2010, le d\u00e9bat n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clos quand la Chambre a ajourn\u00e9 ses travaux pour l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 le 17 juin 2010, et ce, jusqu\u2019au 20 septembre suivant. La Chambre des communes n\u2019a pas touch\u00e9 au projet de loi depuis qu\u2019elle a repris ses travaux le 20 septembre 2010.\n[11] Comme les parties, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 6 juillet, ne s\u2019entendaient pas sur la question de savoir s\u2019il fallait ajourner de nouveau l\u2019examen de ces questions, ainsi que le demandait l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 instruction \u00e0 ce dernier de mettre en \u00e9tat sa requ\u00eate en ajournement en d\u00e9posant un avis de requ\u00eate, un affidavit et des observations \u00e9crites, a donn\u00e9 instruction aux plaignants et \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9poser leurs observations en r\u00e9ponse, et a donn\u00e9 instruction \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 ces observations.\n[12] \u00c0 la suite de ces instructions, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son avis de requ\u00eate sollicitant l\u2019ajournement susmentionn\u00e9, de m\u00eame que ses observations et son affidavit, les plaignants et la Commission ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs observations concernant leur opposition \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 ces observations.\n[13] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sont, en bref, les suivantes :\nl\u2019adoption du nouveau texte de loi, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire le projet de loi C\u20113, est susceptible de r\u00e9gler les plaintes ou, subsidiairement, d\u2019en transformer radicalement la nature, ce qui rendrait th\u00e9orique n\u2019importe quelle d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ; les plaintes, de la mani\u00e8re dont elles sont pr\u00e9sentement structur\u00e9es, obligeraient l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives que l\u2019on a jug\u00e9es inconstitutionnelles et qui seront remplac\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113; les recours que les plaignants sollicitent ne sont peut-\u00eatre pas possibles ; l\u2019inscription en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens ne constitue peut-\u00eatre pas un service au sens de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne ; l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9voit \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle que l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, relativement aux dispositions que l\u2019on a jug\u00e9es inconstitutionnelles et qui seront remplac\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113, durera plusieurs semaines, eu \u00e9gard \u00e0 la quantit\u00e9 des documents qui seront cens\u00e9ment communiqu\u00e9s et \u00e0 la nature historique qu\u2019une telle d\u00e9fense pourrait avoir ; pour s\u2019assurer que l\u2019on \u00e9tudie convenablement les plaintes et que l\u2019on utilise de la mani\u00e8re la plus appropri\u00e9e possible le temps pass\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, il faudrait ajourner les plaintes sine die ou, subsidiairement, jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011, afin de permettre l\u2019adoption du projet de loi C\u20113 qui est actuellement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude \u00e0 la Chambre des communes.\n[14] Les observations des plaignants sont, en bref, les suivantes :\nles plaignants sont conscients que l\u2019ORI ne peut pas les inscrire en vertu de la version de la Loi sur les Indiens qui est actuellement en vigueur. Ce n\u2019est pas une r\u00e9vision des politiques ou du protocole d\u2019inscription de l\u2019ORI qu\u2019ils sollicitent; ils demandent que le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne examine l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens et d\u00e9cide si cette disposition viole leurs droits, au sens de la LCDP ; le Tribunal ne devrait pas faire droit \u00e0 ce que son processus soit de nouveau retard\u00e9 en fonction de ce qui peut arriver ou non au projet de loi C\u20113 au sein de la Chambre des communes. Le Tribunal doit donner suite aux plaintes qui lui sont soumises, en fonction du droit et des lois qui sont actuellement en vigueur ; les plaignants sont d\u2019avis que le projet de loi C\u20113, dans la forme o\u00f9 il est actuellement soumis \u00e0 la Chambre des communes, ne r\u00e9glera pas enti\u00e8rement le fond de leurs plaintes ; le fait de retarder davantage le r\u00e8glement de l\u2019affaire continuera de porter pr\u00e9judice aux plaignants, et surtout en les privant encore du droit possible de faire reconna\u00eetre une identit\u00e9 ethnique qu\u2019on leur nie depuis leur naissance ; il ne faudrait accorder aucun poids \u00e0 l\u2019argument de rentabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9, eu \u00e9gard aux violations continues et s\u00e9rieuses dont les plaignants sont victimes sur le plan des droits de la personne. Ces derniers ne se soucient pas de la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audition potentielle et soutiennent que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a eu amplement de temps pour se pr\u00e9parer ; m\u00eame si les faits et les questions litigieuses que comporte l\u2019affaire des plaignants sont semblables \u00e0 ceux dont il \u00e9tait question dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor, il s\u2019agit n\u00e9anmoins de revendications distinctes qui sont poursuivies au sein de juridictions diff\u00e9rentes ; ces revendications sont assorties chacune de consid\u00e9rations, de politiques et de proc\u00e9dures qui leur sont propres et qu\u2019il convient de suivre et d\u2019appliquer.\n[15] Les observations de la Commission sont, en bref, les suivantes :\nLa Commission s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande actuelle d\u2019ajournement des proc\u00e9dures sine die ou jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011. Elle demande plut\u00f4t que le Tribunal \u00e9tablisse un \u00e9ch\u00e9ancier pour traiter de l\u2019argument pr\u00e9liminaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel le gouvernement ne fournit pas un service au sens de la LCDP lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9cide du droit d\u2019\u00eatre inscrit en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. C\u2019est cette approche-l\u00e0 qu\u2019il convient de privil\u00e9gier d\u2019apr\u00e8s la Commission car :\nelle \u00e9vite de prolonger le processus d\u2019audition par une s\u00e9rie de longs ajournements ; rien dans le projet de loi que le Parlement \u00e9tudie \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle n\u2019aurait une incidence sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou les arguments qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9gler la question des services ; cette approche favorise l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures en mettant l\u2019accent sur une question de comp\u00e9tence pr\u00e9liminaire distincte qui offre la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gler finalement les plaintes.\n[16] Il est \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence tr\u00e8s irritant et d\u00e9cevant pour les plaignants de voir l\u2019examen de leurs plaintes retard\u00e9 pendant que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor, attend que le Parlement du Canada l\u00e9gif\u00e8re en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ses conclusions selon lesquelles certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens sont inop\u00e9rants pour des motifs d\u2019ordre constitutionnel.\n[17] La d\u00e9cision que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a prise dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ne pas formuler un jugement d\u00e9claratoire qui mettrait en vigueur ses conclusions concernant la validit\u00e9 de certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens afin de permettre au Parlement du Canada d\u2019adopter des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives r\u00e9paratrices, signifie qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle l\u2019article 6, d\u2019un point de vue technique, demeure encore pleinement en vigueur mais que, d\u2019un point de vue pratique, il est d\u2019une validit\u00e9 suffisamment douteuse pour que le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal ne puisse \u00e0 ce stade-ci fonder sur lui une d\u00e9cision quelconque. Cela est d\u2019autant plus vrai que la Chambre des communes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 et soumis \u00e0 deux lectures le projet de loi C\u20113.\n[18] L\u2019un des buts et des objectifs du Tribunal consiste assur\u00e9ment \u00e0 r\u00e9gler de mani\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditive les plaintes qui lui sont soumises et \u00e0 \u00e9viter les retards inutiles et indus qui ont pour effet, en th\u00e9orie, de ne pas rendre justice. Il convient toutefois de mettre ce but et cet objectif en balance avec le but et l\u2019objectif tout aussi importants qu\u2019a le Tribunal de veiller \u00e0 ce que ses d\u00e9cisions soient justes et significatives, et non simplement rendues avec c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[19] Les parties reconnaissent toutes que l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens ne conf\u00e8re pas actuellement \u00e0 l\u2019ORI le pouvoir d\u2019inscrire une personne qui ne satisfait pas aux exigences l\u00e9gales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019inscription comme Indien que pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 6, car l\u2019ORI n\u2019a pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider si une personne satisfait \u00e0 ces exigences ou non.\n[20] Etches c. Canada (Registrar of Indian and Northern Affairs), 2009 ONCA 182\n[21] Quelle que soit la mesure dans laquelle, de l\u2019avis des plaignants et de la Commission, le libell\u00e9 actuel du projet de loi C\u20113 emp\u00eache d\u2019accorder aux plaignants les recours qu\u2019ils sollicitent, la Chambre des communes a donn\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor en d\u00e9posant le projet de loi C\u20113 et en le soumettant \u00e0 deux lectures. On ignore \u00e0 ce stade-ci ce que ce projet de loi permettra d\u2019accomplir en fin de compte, et il est purement conjectural de faire des pr\u00e9visions quant \u00e0 son libell\u00e9 d\u00e9finitif.\n[22] Tant les plaignants que la Commission sont d\u2019avis que le Tribunal, \u00e0 cause du retard de la Chambre des communes \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor ainsi que de l\u2019incertitude du libell\u00e9 actuel des dispositions r\u00e9paratrices propos\u00e9es dont la Chambre est actuellement saisie, devrait prendre une d\u00e9cision maintenant en se fondant sur l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, et ce, m\u00eame si la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor, que cette disposition est inop\u00e9rante, sous r\u00e9serve de la suspension temporaire de son jugement d\u00e9claratoire.\n[23] Je suis \u00e0 la fois nettement en faveur d\u2019un traitement exp\u00e9ditif en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et d\u00e9\u00e7u par le fait que le Parlement n\u2019ait pas adopt\u00e9 de dispositions l\u00e9gislatives r\u00e9paratrices, mais je ne puis voir aucune valeur ou aucun avantage r\u00e9els, d\u2019un point de vue pratique, \u00e0 fixer une audition, comme le demande la Commission, compte tenu des circonstances actuelles, en vue de d\u00e9cider si, aux termes de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, il existe un service d\u2019inscription en vertu de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens, alors que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat McIvor, a jug\u00e9 que l\u2019article 6 est inop\u00e9rant et que la loi, dans sa forme actuelle, ne permet pas d\u2019inscrire les plaignants. M\u00eame si cette audition pourrait donner l\u2019impression que les choses progressent, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, une telle audition, fond\u00e9e sur des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives d\u00e9j\u00e0 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme non valides, n\u2019est selon moi ni appropri\u00e9e ni concr\u00e8tement utile \u00e0 quiconque.\n[24] En d\u00e9finitive, pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je ferai droit \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en vue d\u2019obtenir un ajournement jusqu\u2019au 31 janvier 2011 et nous verrons ce que la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique ou le Parlement feront ensuite.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Divulgation additionnelle [1] Les questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce portent sur des droits fondamentaux de la personne. Les principes de la justice naturelle exigent que les deux parties puissent pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui soutiennent leur position. Cependant, cela ne permet pas aux parties de contester toutes les affirmations suppl\u00e9mentaires faites \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure (les R\u00e8gles) du Tribunal sont plus souples que celles d\u2019une instance judiciaire, cependant elles visent \u00e0 faire en sorte que les parties ne soient pas surprises par une divulgation de derni\u00e8re minute. Les articles 6 et 9 des R\u00e8gles exigent la divulgation de toutes les preuves potentiellement pertinentes :\n6 Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, divulgation, production\nExpos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions\n6(1) Chaque partie doit signifier et d\u00e9poser dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions indiquant :\nles faits pertinents que la partie cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa cause ; sa position au sujet des questions de droit que soul\u00e8ve la cause ; le redressement recherch\u00e9 ; les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession - pour lesquels aucun privil\u00e8ge de non divulgation n\u2019est invoqu\u00e9 - et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle; les divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession - pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge de non divulgation est invoqu\u00e9 - et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de cette r\u00e8gle; les noms des divers t\u00e9moins - autres que les t\u00e9moins experts - qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer ainsi qu\u2019un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu de chacun d\u2019eux.\nR\u00e9plique\n6(2) Le plaignant et la Commission doivent signifier et d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9plique dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur,\ns\u2019ils ont l\u2019intention de prouver des faits ou de soulever des questions afin de r\u00e9futer l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9; si ces faits ou questions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019ils ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 6(1).\nRapports des t\u00e9moins experts et rapports en r\u00e9ponse\n6(3) Chaque partie doit signifier \u00e0 toutes les autres parties et d\u00e9poser devant le Tribunal, dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 par le membre instructeur,\na) un rapport pour chaque t\u00e9moin expert qu\u2019elle a l\u2019intention de citer.

Sur permission du Tribunal, les parties peuvent pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments, mais il faut s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la divulgation de derni\u00e8re minute ait des d\u00e9savantages. Si la divulgation de derni\u00e8re minute est accord\u00e9e, l\u2019autre partie doit pouvoir se pr\u00e9parer suffisamment pour qu\u2019il soit satisfait aux principes de la justice naturelle. La partie qui a divulgu\u00e9 des preuves \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute subira une part des d\u00e9savantages.\n[3] Le 1er novembre 2010, la pi\u00e8ce C\u20111, onglet 18, a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la plaignante\u2011t\u00e9moin, mais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve parce qu\u2019une objection a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e. L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que ce document, soit une affiche d\u2019emploi et un curriculum vitae, ne leur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 que le matin m\u00eame et que, par cons\u00e9quent, ils n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de l\u2019examiner. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e profite de l\u2019occasion et examine le document pendant la soir\u00e9e afin de r\u00e9parer le pr\u00e9judice et de se pr\u00e9parer correctement. Le lendemain, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la plaignante une s\u00e9rie de documents qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s au pr\u00e9alable et qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve. L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a obtenu du temps pour examiner les documents avant de se prononcer \u00e0 leur sujet. Apr\u00e8s cet examen, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 voir l\u2019original du bar\u00e8me de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, ce qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9. Il a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 pouvoir discuter de ces nouveaux documents avec la plaignante\u2011t\u00e9moin qui est toujours sous serment, son interrogatoire principal n\u2019\u00e9tant pas termin\u00e9.\n[4] Apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte des observations des parties et de la r\u00e8gle d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, je conclus que la plaignante-t\u00e9moin n\u2019aura pas l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner les documents au pr\u00e9alable. Si l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e souhaite d\u00e9poser ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments en preuve, il peut le faire et pr\u00e9senter ces documents, y compris l\u2019original du bar\u00e8me de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, \u00e0 la plaignante et lui donner suffisamment de temps pour les examiner \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins.\nB. Ajout de t\u00e9moins [5] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a soulev\u00e9 la question du fait que la plaignante\u2011t\u00e9moin avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019entendait bien avec ses coll\u00e8gues. L\u2019avocat a expliqu\u00e9 que ce t\u00e9moignage l\u2019avait pris par surprise parce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante qu\u2019elle contesterait la validit\u00e9 de ses \u00e9valuations de rendement. L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a r\u00e9pondu en citant les paragraphes suivants de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de sa cliente\n[Traduction] Paragraphe 4 : La plaignante \u00e9tait une bonne employ\u00e9e, comp\u00e9tente, loyale et travaillante.\nParagraphe 21 : \u00c0 ce sujet, la plaignante soutient que, pour autant que soient valables les commentaires et les critiques dans ses \u00e9valuations de rendement de 2005 et de 2006, de tels commentaires et critiques sont directement attribuables aux sympt\u00f4mes du diab\u00e8te, dont la plaignante souffre.\nParagraphe 31 : Les \u00e9valuations de rendement de la plaignante, effectu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e9taient n\u00e9gatives en 2005 et en 2006. La principale critique dans ces \u00e9valuations de rendement portait sur des questions d\u2019attitude et de personnalit\u00e9, ainsi que sur des questions d\u2019\u00e9thique de travail et de charge de travail. La capacit\u00e9 inh\u00e9rente de la plaignante d\u2019effectuer son travail n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9e. Bien que la plaignante n\u2019e\u00fbt pas accept\u00e9 la validit\u00e9 de toutes les critiques dans son \u00e9valuation, au moment o\u00f9 elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crites, la plaignante reconna\u00eet que, pour autant que les critiques fussent valables, elles \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont elle se sentait en 2005 et en 2006.\n[6] Bien qu\u2019il ne soit peut\u2011\u00eatre pas \u00e9vident \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue que la plaignante avait l\u2019intention de contester la validit\u00e9 de ses \u00e9valuations de rendement, on peut d\u00e9duire ce fait \u00e0 la lecture des paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents.\n[7] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare que l\u2019intim\u00e9e et lui avaient avis\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de la plaignante de leur intention de possiblement appeler d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, mais le Tribunal note que cette lettre, comme l\u2019avocat de la plaignante l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue que le vendredi avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience.\n[8] Le fait que la plaignante\u2011t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019entendait bien avec ses coll\u00e8gues peut \u00eatre mis en doute, en fonction de ce que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9sente comme r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage anticip\u00e9. L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que, si le Tribunal acceptait que ces t\u00e9moins suppl\u00e9mentaires soient appel\u00e9s, il devrait r\u00e9\u00e9valuer son dossier et possiblement pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et appeler d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, ce qui serait pr\u00e9judiciable au processus.\n[9] Les deux parties peuvent demander l\u2019ajout de t\u00e9moins en pr\u00e9sentant au pr\u00e9alable des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s pr\u00e9cis des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s, y compris des d\u00e9clarations claires au sujet des questions qui seront trait\u00e9es dans les t\u00e9moignages, la pertinence quant \u00e0 l\u2019affaire et un estim\u00e9 du temps n\u00e9cessaire pour les t\u00e9moignages. Ils ne devraient pas \u00eatre redondants et ne devraient pas s\u2019\u00e9loigner de la question \u00e0 trancher. Ces r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s seront examin\u00e9s par le Tribunal, qui d\u00e9cidera ensuite si les t\u00e9moins peuvent t\u00e9moigner. Le Tribunal examinera la pertinence du contenu des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s et les r\u00e9percussions sur le processus complet avant d\u2019accorder les ajouts. Si les t\u00e9moins sont ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la liste des t\u00e9moins, le Tribunal s\u2019attend \u00e0 une divulgation compl\u00e8te de tout document \u00e0 l\u2019appui pour ces t\u00e9moins avant l\u2019audience.\n[10] Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 attentivement la nature de la preuve en question, les objections quant \u00e0 son admissibilit\u00e9, la pertinence de la preuve et le manque de fiabilit\u00e9 ou le pr\u00e9judice possibles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9s dans les objections.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon Membre du tribunal\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 3 novembre 2010\nTRIBUNAL canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1452\/7809\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Heather Lynn Grant c.

QUEL EST LE REDRESSEMENT APPROPRI\u00c9?\nI. INTRODUCTION : [1] La plaignante, qui est n\u00e9e le 29 juin 1944, all\u00e8gue avoir travaill\u00e9 durant une vingtaine d'ann\u00e9es au Minist\u00e8re des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res et Commerce international (MAECI), tant au Canada qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, elle apportait un soutien administratif \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s de niveau senior du gouvernement. \u00c0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, soit de 1989 \u00e0 1995, elle fut en cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 cause d'une fibromyalgie.\n[2] Le 5 janvier 2001 la plaignante demanda son transfert du MAECI \u00e0 l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux, qui \u00e9tait rattach\u00e9e \u00e0 la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres de la Commission de la Fonction publique du Canada. Elle y occupa alors le poste de Coordonnateur du portefeuille, consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un poste de nature cl\u00e9ricale et fut class\u00e9e au groupe et niveau CR-5.\n[3] Dans le but de moderniser sa structure, qui n'avait pas subi de transformation majeure depuis 1918, la Commission de la Fonction Publique effectua en 2003 de nombreuses modifications sans r\u00e9duire ses effectifs. De plus, elle prit soin d'agir en conformit\u00e9 avec les recommandations du Task Force sur la modernisation de la gestion des ressources humaines dans la fonction publique et dans le respect des changements l\u00e9gislatifs tels qu'\u00e9tablis par la Loi C-25.\n[4] Deux de ces transformations apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres eurent des cons\u00e9quences majeures pour la plaignante puisqu'ils entra\u00een\u00e8rent dans un premier temps la fermeture le 30 juin 2003 de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux o\u00f9 travaillait la plaignante. Cette fermeture provoqua automatiquement la suppression de 11 postes, dont celui de la plaignante.\n[5] Dans un second temps, soit le 31 octobre 2003, les dirigeants ferm\u00e8rent le reste de la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 renomm\u00e9e Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement, \u00e0 laquelle la plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e. Cette seconde fermeture entra\u00eena la disparition de 10 autres postes. Une fois de plus, le poste de la plaignante fut supprim\u00e9. Celle-ci se retrouva donc sans assignation pr\u00e9cise.\n[6] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode subs\u00e9quente et ce, jusqu'au d\u00e9but de 2005, la plaignante, qui avait le statut d'employ\u00e9e touch\u00e9e, occupa diff\u00e9rents postes au sein de la Commission de la Fonction publique, parfois avec assignation \u00e9crite et parfois sans assignation \u00e9crite ; elle passa \u00e9galement plusieurs mois en cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 au cours de cette p\u00e9riode. Le 13 janvier 2005, jugeant sa situation intenable, la plaignante d\u00e9missionna de la Fonction publique et prit sa retraite.\n[7] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2006, la plaignante d\u00e9posa une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9e, son ancien employeur, \u00e0 savoir la Commission de la Fonction publique. Elle y all\u00e9guait que l'intim\u00e9e avait fait montre de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard sur la base de son \u00e2ge et de sa d\u00e9ficience et ce, en contravention avec les articles 7 (Emploi) et 10 (Lignes de conduite discriminatoires) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[8] Elle y all\u00e9gua que sa sant\u00e9 s'\u00e9tait d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e principalement \u00e0 cause du comportement des agents de l'intim\u00e9e ; que pour ces motifs, elle fut oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9missionner de son travail. Sa retraite pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9e l'aurait emp\u00each\u00e9e de continuer de travailler 5 ans de plus et d'ajouter 5 autres ann\u00e9es de contributions \u00e0 son r\u00e9gime de retraite, contrairement \u00e0 son plan de carri\u00e8re. Elle d\u00e9clara en effet avoir pr\u00e9vu travailler jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans. Les cons\u00e9quences de sa retraite pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e en d\u00e9coulant furent tr\u00e8s dommageables sur les plans \u00e9conomiques et sant\u00e9. Cons\u00e9quemment, elle r\u00e9clama une compensation pour les dommages subis.\nA. LA PLAIGNANTE SE REPR\u00c9SENTE ELLE-M\u00caME : [9] La plaignante, au d\u00e9but de l'audience, le 14 septembre 2009, par le biais d'une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire, demande verbalement au pr\u00e9sident du tribunal la permission de reporter l'audience \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure, au motif qu'elle aurait besoin de plus de temps pour se constituer un nouveau procureur et mieux se pr\u00e9parer.\n[10] Elle informa alors le tribunal qu'au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, elle avait acc\u00e8s aux services d'un procureur que son syndicat lui avait offert de payer.\n[11] Elle aurait ensuite consult\u00e9 une non-avocate qui lui offrit de la repr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la condition qu'elle renonce \u00e0 faire affaires avec l'avocat du syndicat. La plaignante pr\u00e9f\u00e9ra suivre ce conseil et entreprendre le dossier assist\u00e9e de cette personne mais sans la pr\u00e9sence de l'avocat du syndicat.\n[12] Finalement, la plaignante informa le tribunal au d\u00e9but de juin 2009, quelques jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience pr\u00e9vue pour la fin de juin et d\u00e9but de juillet, que la conseill\u00e8re qui l'avait aid\u00e9e \u00e0 confectionner son dossier avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de cesser de la repr\u00e9senter et ce, pour des raisons de sant\u00e9.\n[13] Il fut alors entendu avec le tribunal que l'audience pr\u00e9vue pour la fin de juin et le d\u00e9but de juillet 2009 serait report\u00e9e \u00e0 la semaine du 14 au 18 septembre 2009 et ce, afin de donner du temps \u00e0 la plaignante de se constituer un nouveau procureur et de se pr\u00e9parer.\n[14] Pour justifier sa demande de remise formul\u00e9e le 14 septembre, alors que sa demande initiale de juin n'invoquait qu'un seul motif, \u00e0 savoir la sant\u00e9 de sa conseill\u00e8re qui ne lui aurait pas permis de continuer, elle ajouta un second motif : il y aurait eu m\u00e9sentente entre elle et sa repr\u00e9sentante quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on de piloter le dossier. C'est pour ces deux motifs qu'elle aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de poursuivre sans les services de cette conseill\u00e8re.\n[15] Pour renforcer cette seconde demande de remise, elle pr\u00e9cisa qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 si malade au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2009 qu'elle n'avait pu s'occuper de son dossier comme elle l'aurait voulu et qu'il lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour impossible de trouver un procureur qui aurait accept\u00e9 de la repr\u00e9senter moyennant un honoraire conditionnel.\n[16] Le Tribunal qui, conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de l'article 48.9 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, qui lui exige de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'instruction des plaintes de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, jugea que le d\u00e9lai additionnel de 2.5 mois d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour se pr\u00e9parer et pour se constituer un nouveau procureur avait \u00e9t\u00e9 amplement suffisant et respectait le principe de justice naturelle. Il ordonna donc la poursuite de l'audience sans autre d\u00e9lai.\n[17] Afin de faciliter la compr\u00e9hension du pr\u00e9sent jugement, nous commencerons par exposer \u00e0 la section II les faits et reproches \u00e0 l'origine de la plainte de la plaignante, en respectant la chronologie des \u00e9v\u00e9nements. Puis, \u00e0 la section III, nous ferons l'\u00e9tude des autres faits et reproches formul\u00e9s par la plaignante, que nous n'avons pu ins\u00e9rer dans cette chronologie, au motif qu'il s'agit de faits de nature prolong\u00e9e et continue. Nous nous pencherons ensuite \u00e0 la section IV sur les crit\u00e8res juridiques applicables puis \u00e0 la section V, proc\u00e9derons \u00e0 une analyse des questions en litige avant de terminer \u00e0 la section VI par nos observations sur le redressement appropri\u00e9 dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\nII. FAITS ET REPROCHES \u00c0 L'ORIGINE DE LA PLAINTE SELON UN ORDRE CHRONOLOGIQUE A. Fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux [18] Au d\u00e9but de janvier 2003, la vice-pr\u00e9sidente de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, r\u00e9unit les employ\u00e9s de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux qui \u00e9taient rattach\u00e9s \u00e0 sa direction, incluant la plaignante, pour les informer que, dans le cadre de la restructuration de la Commission de la fonction publique, leur unit\u00e9 fermerait ses portes le 30 juin suivant.\n[19] Elle les assura que suite \u00e0 cette r\u00e9organisation, personne ne perdrait son poste et que le bureau des ressources humaines, alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par son directeur, s'occuperait de leur situation en les assistant dans leurs d\u00e9marches pour se d\u00e9nicher un nouveau poste du m\u00eame groupe et niveau.\n[20] En mars 2003, la plaignante commen\u00e7a \u00e0 travailler pour la Vice-Pr\u00e9sidente de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement, en tant que soutien administratif. Lorsque le rempla\u00e7ant de la Vice-Pr\u00e9sidente entra en fonction le 1er avril 2003, il invita la plaignante \u00e0 continuer de travailler pour lui \u00e0 titre d'adjointe \u00e0 la correspondance ; elle continua d'offrir en m\u00eame temps un soutien administratif au directeur des projets sp\u00e9ciaux.\n[21] Selon la plaignante, des 11 personnes qui travaillaient \u00e0 la Direction, quelques-unes en ont profit\u00e9 pour prendre leur retraite et les autres, qui \u00e9taient toutes beaucoup plus jeunes qu'elle-m\u00eame, alors \u00e2g\u00e9e de 59 ans, ont toutes trouv\u00e9 un emploi avant la fin de juin 2003, sauf elle.\n[22] Selon les t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e, la version est un peu diff\u00e9rente. Ils all\u00e8guent que c'\u00e9tait \u00e9galement le cas de la plaignante et qu'elle continuait de profiter du statut d'employ\u00e9e touch\u00e9e.\nB. Fermeture de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement [23] Les dirigeants de la Commission de la fonction publique prirent \u00e9galement la d\u00e9cision de fermer ce qui restait de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement \u00e0 compter du 31 octobre 2003. La plaignante faisait partie de cette direction qui n'\u00e9tait alors compos\u00e9e que de 11 personnes.\n[24] Selon la plaignante, quelques-unes de ces personnes en ont profit\u00e9 pour prendre leur retraite et les autres, qui \u00e9taient toutes beaucoup plus jeunes que la plaignante, alors \u00e2g\u00e9e de 59 ans, ont toutes trouv\u00e9 un emploi. Seule la plaignante n'a pu se trouver un emploi.\n[25] \u00c0 nouveau, la version des t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e diff\u00e8re quelque peu. Ils insistent sur le fait que la plaignante a continu\u00e9 d'\u00eatre \u00e0 l'emploi de la Commission de la fonction publique et qu'elle continuait de profiter du statut d'employ\u00e9e touch\u00e9e.\nC. Abandon de la plaignante durant 6 semaines [26] La plaignante d\u00e9plora avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e seule au cours d'une p\u00e9riode de 6 semaines dans un grand espace devenu vacant au 21e \u00e9tage de l'Esplanade Laurier, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9part des employ\u00e9s de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement. Il en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi pour la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant au d\u00e9but de novembre et se terminant \u00e0 la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[27] Le directeur des ressources humaines, qui a reconnu que le service dont il avait la charge, devait s'occuper des personnes \u00e0 la recherche d'emploi dont l'Unit\u00e9 o\u00f9 la Direction avait \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9e d\u00e9clara avoir \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque ignor\u00e9 tout de la p\u00e9riode de six semaines que la plaignante all\u00e9gua avoir pass\u00e9 seule au 21e \u00e9tage de l'Esplanade Laurier.\n[28] Lorsque questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir s'il leur arrivait souvent de perdre des employ\u00e9s, il avoua que c'\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois, \u00e0 sa connaissance, qu'il entendait parler de ce cas et qu'il n'avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une telle situation auparavant. Ni lui ni les autres t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e ne furent en mesure d'apporter quelqu'\u00e9claircissement que ce soit \u00e0 cette situation.\n[29] Le directeur des ressources humaines pr\u00e9cisa que la plaignante a continu\u00e9 n\u00e9anmoins de recevoir son salaire au cours de cette p\u00e9riode et, par la suite, jusqu'au moment de sa retraite. Deux des t\u00e9moins entendus, qui avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 quitt\u00e9 les lieux pour travailler ailleurs \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, n'\u00e9taient pas en mesure de commenter ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 au cours de cette p\u00e9riode de six semaines.\nD. La plaignante occupe le poste de secr\u00e9taire administrative aupr\u00e8s de la Directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et e la diversit\u00e9 [30] La plaignante effectua des repr\u00e9sentations aupr\u00e8s du Conseiller strat\u00e9gique principal, gestionnaire qu'elle connaissait elle lui exposa sa situation et lui demanda de l'aider \u00e0 se trouver un nouveau poste. Gr\u00e2ce aux d\u00e9marches de celui-ci, elle put rapidement obtenir du travail \u00e0 court terme aupr\u00e8s de la Directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la direction de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la diversit\u00e9, \u00e0 titre d'adjointe administrative, o\u00f9 elle commen\u00e7a \u00e0 la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2003. Il s'agissait cependant \u00e0 nouveau d'une affectation temporaire.\nE. Invalidit\u00e9 de la plaignante [31] Le 19 janvier 2004, apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 pour la Directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la direction de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la diversit\u00e9 pendant environ un mois, la plaignante devint malade et tomba en invalidit\u00e9. Elle aurait alors eu des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre digestif ainsi que des probl\u00e8mes de m\u00e9moire. Selon la plaignante, ces sympt\u00f4mes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s principalement par son travail et l'inqui\u00e9tude qui la rongeait du fait qu'elle craignait de se retrouver sans emploi.\n[32] Alors que la plaignante all\u00e8gue que ces sympt\u00f4mes pouvaient s'expliquer principalement par les probl\u00e8mes qu'elle rencontrait \u00e0 son travail, les t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e exprim\u00e8rent l'id\u00e9e au cours de l'audience, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des rapports m\u00e9dicaux des m\u00e9decins de la plaignante : que le travail de madame n'\u00e9tait pas le seul \u00e9l\u00e9ment d\u00e9clencheur de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9; que des probl\u00e8mes d'ordre personnel pourraient \u00e9galement \u00eatre la cause d'une bonne partie de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, tel qu'il appara\u00eet dans les rapports m\u00e9dicaux, notamment de la psychiatre de la plaignante.\n[33] Le m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante est venu expliquer au tribunal que le stress qu'\u00e9prouvait la plaignante \u00e0 son travail n'\u00e9tait pas la cause de sa d\u00e9pression mais un des \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u00e9clencheurs importants.\n[34] Ce m\u00eame m\u00e9decin r\u00e9digea une note \u00e0 l'effet que la plaignante serait en cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode allant du 19 janvier au 1er mars 2004. La plaignante insiste sur le fait que cette note ne signifiait pas qu'elle serait disponible pour effectuer un retour au travail le 1er mars mais plut\u00f4t que sa situation m\u00e9dicale devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9vis\u00e9e \u00e0 la fin de cette p\u00e9riode d'invalidit\u00e9 et que jusqu'alors, elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e ce qui, d'ailleurs, fut confirm\u00e9 par le m\u00e9decin au cours de son t\u00e9moignage.\nF. L'offre du poste de Coordonnateur de programme janvier 2004 [35] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres de l'\u00e9poque, qui avait un poste \u00e0 combler, fit part aux ressources humaines de ses besoins. On lui proposa la candidature de la plaignante en lui expliquant la situation pr\u00e9caire dans laquelle elle se trouvait et qu'il \u00e9tait dans le plus grand int\u00e9r\u00eat de celle-ci d'accepter le poste qu'on pourrait lui offrir puisque le temps pouvait jouer contre elle. En effet, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu'elle avait le statut d'employ\u00e9e touch\u00e9e, elle devait appr\u00e9hender le jour o\u00f9 elle deviendrait employ\u00e9e exc\u00e9dentaire. Ce qui signifiait que dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9, elle deviendrait exc\u00e9dentaire et pourrait \u00e9ventuellement \u00eatre mise-\u00e0-pied. Les ressources humaines firent parvenir le curriculum vitae (C.V.) de la plaignante au Directeur du ressourcement des cadres.\n[36] Apr\u00e8s \u00e9tude du C.V. de la plaignante, Directeur du ressourcement des cadres consulta quelques personnes pour obtenir des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences sur celle-ci, dont le Directeur des projets sp\u00e9ciaux de l'\u00e9poque. Les r\u00e9ponses furent suffisamment favorables pour qu'il juge la candidature de la plaignante int\u00e9ressante.\n[37] Il lui t\u00e9l\u00e9phona donc le 20 janvier 2004, pour lui annoncer que le poste de Coordonnateur de programme aupr\u00e8s de la Direction du renouvellement du personnel de direction, qu'il dirigeait, \u00e9tait disponible et lui \u00e9tait offert, tout en pr\u00e9cisant qu'il s'agissait d'un poste du niveau CR-5.\n[38] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres est venu expliquer au tribunal qu'il avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 recruter du personnel et \u00e0 les garder. C'est pourquoi, il se donnait la peine de parler ou de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoner personnellement aux candidats \u00e9ventuels pour vendre sa salade en montrant beaucoup d'enthousiasme, dans le but bien \u00e9vident de les inciter \u00e0 venir travailler dans sa direction. Il faisait de son mieux pour les motiver. Et c'est ce qu'il fit au cours de cet appel.\n[39] Celui-ci aurait alors offert \u00e0 la plaignante le poste de Coordonnateur de programme qu'il qualifia alors de niveau administratif mais qui, en fait, selon la plaignante, n'\u00e9tait rien d'autre qu'un poste de nature cl\u00e9ricale o\u00f9 elle aurait d\u00fb principalement travailler devant un ordinateur environ 7 heures par jour et faire du travail genre copier\/coller.\n[40] La plaignante d\u00e9plora que ce poste ne correspondait nullement \u00e0 ses comp\u00e9tences et qualifications, qui \u00e9taient pourtant \u00e9tal\u00e9es dans son C.V., que le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres avait en main. Sans compter que ce genre de travail entrait en contravention avec la note r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par son m\u00e9decin de famille en 2001 (Voir R-1 onglet 5) qui \u00e9tait dans son dossier et qui faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de fibromyalgie. Elle aurait r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat pour un poste de nature administrative. Malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9action plus que ti\u00e8de de la plaignante, le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres aurait continu\u00e9 d'insister et tent\u00e9 de la rassurer quant \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d'effectuer un tel poste.\n[41] Il lui brossa un tableau de la liste des t\u00e2ches rattach\u00e9es au poste offert, tenta de la rassurer en lui indiquant que m\u00eame si elle n'avait pas d'exp\u00e9rience dans ce genre de travail, ils \u00e9taient en mesure de lui offrir de la formation. Il fit de son mieux pour lui faire sentir qu'il aimerait l'avoir dans sa direction.\n[42] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres lui aurait alors repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, d'une mani\u00e8re qualifi\u00e9e de mena\u00e7ante par la plaignante, qu'en n'acceptant pas le poste offert, il pourrait y avoir des cons\u00e9quences f\u00e2cheuses pour elle et que cela pourrait avoir pour effet qu'elle soit mise sur une liste de priorit\u00e9 et qu'au bout d'un an, elle en soit r\u00e9duite au ch\u00f4mage. Il aurait termin\u00e9 cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en lui demandant de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir s\u00e9rieusement \u00e0 sa proposition et qu'il la rappellerait dans deux semaines.\n[43] Pour sa part, ce t\u00e9moin est venu expliquer que ce n'est que lorsqu'il s'est rendu compte de la r\u00e9ticence de la plaignante \u00e0 accepter son offre et appr\u00e9hendant un refus de sa part, qu'il s'\u00e9tait risqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'informer des cons\u00e9quences de son refus \u00e9ventuel. Il lui aurait fait part de la situation telle qu'expos\u00e9e par les ressources humaines. Il jugea que c'\u00e9tait pour le plus grand int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante de l'informer du p\u00e9ril de sa situation.\n[44] Elle lui aurait expliqu\u00e9, au cours de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s malade et incapable de retourner au travail en ce moment et ne pouvait lui donner une date approximative de retour au travail. Elle all\u00e9gua lui avoir aussi parl\u00e9 de son probl\u00e8me de fibromyalgie et de ses craintes de r\u00e9cidive que le genre de travail propos\u00e9 pr\u00e9sentait pour une personne avec une telle condition.\n[45] Or, selon la plaignante, m\u00eame si elle \u00e9tait alors tr\u00e8s malade, elle aurait quand m\u00eame pris des notes de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique aussi fid\u00e8lement que possible. Elle les aurait transcrites imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s.\n[46] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres d\u00e9clare qu'en aucun moment au cours de cet appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, la plaignante ne lui a fait mention qu'elle aurait besoin d'arrangements particuliers \u00e0 cause de sa condition m\u00e9dicale particuli\u00e8re ; jamais elle n'a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de fibromyalgie. Il ajouta qu'en aucun autre moment, avant comme apr\u00e8s cette conversation, la plaignante et lui n'ont discut\u00e9 de ses besoins en la mati\u00e8re.\n[47] Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 avoir lui-m\u00eame travaill\u00e9 plusieurs ann\u00e9es dans le domaine des ressources humaines et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 quelques reprises \u00e0 des demandes d'accommodement de la part d'employ\u00e9s qui revenaient d'un cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme. Dans ces situations, il commen\u00e7ait par demander \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 de produire un certificat m\u00e9dical provenant soit du m\u00e9decin de l'employ\u00e9, soit de l'employeur, \u00e9tayant les besoins de l'employ\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'accommodements. Puis, sur r\u00e9ception de ce certificat, il discutait avec l'employ\u00e9 afin de voir comment il pourrait y avoir accommodement. \u00c0 ses yeux, cela allait de soi et qu'il fallait faciliter la t\u00e2che de l'employ\u00e9 et ainsi lui permettre de revenir au meilleur de sa condition.\n[48] Il ajouta cependant que si la plaignante lui avait fait part de son probl\u00e8me de fibromyalgie, c'est la ligne de conduite qu'il aurait suivie. Il pr\u00e9cisa qu'il ne se rendit jamais compte qu'elle pouvait avoir un handicap quelconque.\n[49] Malgr\u00e9 les r\u00e9ticences de la plaignante \u00e9nonc\u00e9es lors de l'appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 janvier, le 21 janvier 2004, elle signa le document R-2, onglet 6 sign\u00e9 par le Directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du ressourcement des cadres, portant la date du 16 janvier 2004, qui \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 R\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'offre de nomination ; cette lettre d'engagement pr\u00e9voyait qu'elle devait se pr\u00e9senter au travail le 1er mars 2004.\n[50] La plaignante d\u00e9clara qu'environ deux semaines plus tard, soit au d\u00e9but de f\u00e9vrier 2004, le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres la rappela, tel que convenu. Il aurait insist\u00e9 de nouveau pour qu'elle accepte son offre et lui fournisse une date de retour au travail. Elle r\u00e9it\u00e9ra qu'elle ne pouvait lui confirmer la date de son retour et que le poste offert n'\u00e9tait pas convenable pour une personne comme elle atteinte de fibromyalgie, et que de plus, on ne lui offrait aucun accommodement. Voici un extrait de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique que la plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir reproduite aussi fid\u00e8lement que possible en dactylographiant son contenu imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s avoir raccroch\u00e9. L'extrait de cette conversation provient de la pi\u00e8ce C-1, onglet 58 :\n... I told him that I still could not give him a date and re-stated that the job he was offering me dit not accommodate my disability and that I had serious doubts about taking it. Mr ( ... ) repeated his threat of my taking a huge risk of landing up unemployed at the end of one year and landing up on the street. This time he scared me much that I told him that I would take his job offer but did not feel that I could not return to the work place until early March. Therefore, despite reports from 2 specialists (Drs X and Y) that stated that they did not feel that I was well enough to return and were even doubtful that I could so with a gradual return of one or two days a week, out of sheer terror of being unemployed, I went back and accepted (...)'s job offer and started work in his shop, still quite ill on March 8, 2004...\n(Les soulign\u00e9s sont les n\u00f4tres)\n[51] Il est difficile d'imaginer cette conversation, que la plaignante all\u00e9gua avoir eue avec le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres en f\u00e9vrier 2004. Comment peut-elle dire This time he scared me much that I told him that I would take his job offer puisqu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sign\u00e9 la R\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'offre de nomination le 21 janvier pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ?\nG. Retour au travail de madame Gravel du 8 mars au 14 avril 2004 [52] Le 1er mars 2004, le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres aurait attendu en vain l'arriv\u00e9e au travail de la plaignante. Celle-ci, qui all\u00e9gua plus tard avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 encore malade au cours de la premi\u00e8re semaine de mars, ne se pr\u00e9senta finalement \u00e0 son nouveau poste que le 8 mars suivant. Elle y travailla jusqu'au 14 avril 2004 alors qu'elle dut cesser de travailler pour cause de maladie. Ce fut son dernier jour de travail. Cette p\u00e9riode d'invalidit\u00e9 qui allait se poursuivre sans arr\u00eat jusqu'au jour de sa d\u00e9mission et du commencement de sa retraite au d\u00e9but de 2005 fut appuy\u00e9e d'un s\u00e9rie de rapports et certificats m\u00e9dicaux.\n[53] Au cours de cette courte p\u00e9riode de travail du 8 mars au 14 avril 2004, de l'avis du Directeur du ressourcement des cadres, la qualit\u00e9 du travail de la plaignante laissait \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer. Sa p\u00e9riode d'apprentissage \u00e9tait p\u00e9nible. Elle prenait beaucoup de temps \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser les nouvelles t\u00e2ches de son poste. La plaignante reconnut elle-m\u00eame que son travail n'\u00e9tait pas satisfaisant et que, c'\u00e9tait suite \u00e0 l'insistance de son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat qu'elle \u00e9tait revenue au travail, bien \u00e9videmment trop rapidement.\nH. P\u00e9riode d'invalidit\u00e9 \u00e0 long terme de la plaignante [54] Le m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante r\u00e9digea une note le 20 mai 2004, produite au soutien des pr\u00e9sentes comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R-2, onglet 7, indiquant que sa patiente (la plaignante) serait en invalidit\u00e9 totale pour la p\u00e9riode allant du 28 avril 2004 jusqu'au 3 septembre 2004.\n[55] Le 10 juin, ce m\u00eame m\u00e9decin pr\u00e9cisa que sa patiente \u00e9tait dans un \u00e9tat de d\u00e9pression s\u00e9v\u00e8re et ne pr\u00e9voyait pas de retour avant le 3 septembre suivant.\n[56] Exception faite du psychiatre de la compagnie d'assurances les trois autres m\u00e9decins qui examin\u00e8rent la plaignante au cours des mois d'\u00e9t\u00e9 et\/ou de l'automne 2004, tous reconnurent que la d\u00e9pression de la plaignante la rendait compl\u00e8tement inapte au travail.\n[57] Dans une lettre du 15 octobre 2004, produite comme pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 11, la compagnie d'assurance accepta de verser \u00e0 la plaignante des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode du 28 juillet au 31 octobre 2004.\n[58] Dans une lettre du 21 janvier 2005, produite comme pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 13, la compagnie d'assurance accepta de verser \u00e0 la plaignante des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 pour la p\u00e9riode du 31 octobre 2004 au 31 mars 2005. Malheureusement, celle-ci avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 au moment de la r\u00e9ception de cette lettre.\n[59] Au d\u00e9but de septembre 2004, le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres d\u00e9clara avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante pour prendre de ses nouvelles. Celle-ci lui aurait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses m\u00e9decins ne voulaient pas qu'elle reprenne le travail.\nI. L'intim\u00e9e, qui \u00e9tait au courant de la d\u00e9pression de la plaignante, aurait d\u00fb en tenir compte et faire les ajustements n\u00e9cessaires lors de sa demande de retour au travail le 8 novembre 2004 [60] Pour sa part, la plaignante d\u00e9clara \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9poque qu'un changement de sa m\u00e9dication avait des effets positifs sur sa sant\u00e9 et qu'elle se sentait assez bien pour envisager en novembre un retour au travail progressif m\u00eame si cet avis n'\u00e9tait pas partag\u00e9 par la psychiatre qui la traitait. Au cours de l'audience, elle d\u00e9clara :\nDespite what Dr. (...) had stated that she was not sure I could do part time, I, the one, knew how I felt and I felt much better that I contacted Mr. (...) and asked him if I could do a gradual return to work.\n[61] Ainsi, la plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat le 8 novembre 2004 et lui aurait alors offert de revenir au travail de fa\u00e7on progressive, en proposant de travailler au d\u00e9but deux jours par semaine puis, plus tard en augmentant jusqu'\u00e0 cinq jours. Elle offrit notamment d'occuper le poste de t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniste alors occup\u00e9 par une employ\u00e9e temporaire et sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 d'inverser leurs t\u00e2ches ; ainsi, la r\u00e9ceptionniste aurait pu ex\u00e9cuter ses propres t\u00e2ches. A cette suggestion, il lui aurait oppos\u00e9 un refus cat\u00e9gorique : Non, non, absolument pas.\n[62] Cette r\u00e9action l'aurait laiss\u00e9e bouche b\u00e9e, d'autant plus qu'au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 elle avait travaill\u00e9 pour lui, elle avait retenu de lui ce qui suit : (extrait de ses notes prises \u00e0 la suite de cet appel du 8 novembre C-1, onglet 57) :\nN.B. : I am truly shocked at what Mr. (...) said and at the harshness of his words and his tone because for the short period of time that I did work for him he was always soft spoken, always calm, prim and proper and always behaved in a professional manner. A very distinguished gentleman ...\n[63] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 cet appel que la plaignante all\u00e9guait lui avoir fait le 8 novembre 2004, le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres d\u00e9clara n'en avoir aucun souvenir. Il rench\u00e9rit m\u00eame n'avoir aucun souvenir d'une demande d'accommodement formul\u00e9e par la plaignante que ce soit par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone ou autrement, ni ce jour ni \u00e0 aucun autre moment.\n[64] La preuve m\u00e9dicale ainsi que les lettres de la compagnie d'assurance d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au dossier sont \u00e0 l'effet que la plaignante aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 en invalidit\u00e9 totale du 14 avril 2004 jusqu'au 1er mars 2005.\n[65] L'extrait suivant, qui provient du dernier paragraphe de la page 2 du rapport m\u00e9dical du Dr. (...), qu'on retrouve \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce R-2, onglet 10, illustre ce que pense alors cette psychiatre relativement \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 d'un retour progressif au travail de la plaignante :\n...I do not feel she can currently return to the workplace full-time and I am not at all optimistic that that will ever be achieved for her given both her age and her past history and her current mechanism of coping. I doubt even that she will manage a part-time reintegration into the workplace to give that a trial. It may be possible but I would start at a low level such as half a day a week.\n[66] Par cons\u00e9quent, cette observation indique qu'au moment o\u00f9 la psychiatre a rencontr\u00e9 la plaignante en novembre 2004, elle n'a pas alors recommand\u00e9 un retour progressif au travail. Elle soulevait m\u00eame des doutes sur la possibilit\u00e9 d'un retour \u00e9ventuel au travail de la plaignante.\nJ. Dernier jour de travail, Lettre de D\u00e9mission et Retraite de la plaignante [67] Dans les faits, la plaignante a travaill\u00e9 jusqu'au milieu d'avril 2004 et aurait encore \u00e9t\u00e9 en invalidit\u00e9 par la suite jusqu'au jour o\u00f9 elle aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9missionner et de prendre sa retraite, en janvier 2005.\n[68] Le 10 janvier 2005, la plaignante fit parvenir \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat une lettre de d\u00e9mission (R-1, onglet 12) l'informant qu'elle allait prendre sa retraite le 13 janvier suivant. Dans cette lettre, la plaignante met le bl\u00e2me sur la compagnie d'assurance qui, en la privant de revenus et en refusant d'assumer le co\u00fbt d'un traitement qui aurait pu lui permettre de reprendre le travail en d\u00e9cembre 2004, comme le lui avait recommand\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin, elle s'est vue oblig\u00e9e de d\u00e9missionner pour pouvoir prendre sa retraite le plus rapidement possible.\n[69] Les motifs fournis par la plaignante pour justifier sa d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9missionner ne font aucune mention du r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par l'intim\u00e9e dans cette affaire et elle n'adresse aucun reproche \u00e0 son patron. Questionn\u00e9e sur l'absence de reproches adress\u00e9s aux repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e, elle r\u00e9pondit que c'\u00e9tait seulement une formule de diplomatie et qu'elle voulait quitter en bons termes. Que d'ailleurs, elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s diplomate dans ce monde qui ignorait tout de la diplomatie.\n[70] Voici la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette lettre de d\u00e9mission que r\u00e9digea son patron sous forme de note manuscrite appos\u00e9e sur la lettre de la plaignante :\nAnn\nI assume you mean January 13, 2005. If it is, I concur with your retirement at the end of the business day January 13, 2005. I wish you all the best and I thank you for your continued dedication.\n( ... ) (signature)\n01.01.12\n[71] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2006, la plaignante d\u00e9posa une plainte devant la Commission des droits de la personne du Canada.\nIII. LES AUTRES FAITS ET REPROCHES DE LA PLAIGNANTE A. Les ressources humaines ne firent rien pour aider la plaignante [72] La plaignante d\u00e9plora que les ressources humaines ne firent rien pour lui trouver un poste. Voici la r\u00e9plique des t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 ce reproche.\n[73] Selon plusieurs t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e, tous les moyens n\u00e9cessaires furent pris pour aider la plaignante \u00e0 se trouver un nouvel emploi.\n[74] Le chef des op\u00e9rations aux ressources humaines de la Commission de la fonction publique, qui connaissait bien la situation de la plaignante, est venu expliquer la fa\u00e7on de fonctionner des ressources humaines.\n[75] En vertu des r\u00e8gles de fonctionnement pr\u00e9vues en cas de r\u00e9affectation du personnel affect\u00e9 par la fermeture d'une unit\u00e9, il fallait d'abord tenter de trouver un emploi \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'unit\u00e9 de travail; ensuite, si aucun poste n'\u00e9tait disponible, il y avait tentative pour replacer l'employ\u00e9 au m\u00eame poste et niveau \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale puis dans le minist\u00e8re et ensuite \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du minist\u00e8re; le t\u00e9moin indiqua que pour comprendre cette approche, il suffit de visualiser quelques cercles concentriques; le plus petit de ces cercles repr\u00e9sentant l'unit\u00e9 de travail de l'employ\u00e9, le cercle suivant celui de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale puis celui du Minist\u00e8re puis le dernier cercle, l'ext\u00e9rieur du minist\u00e8re. Cette approche \u00e9tant privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e afin de d\u00e9ranger le moins possible l'employ\u00e9 et aurait l'avantage d'\u00eatre moins traumatisante pour les employ\u00e9s concern\u00e9s.\n[76] Le t\u00e9moin ajouta que la plaignante \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00eatre de niveau CR-5 et qu'il y avait toujours beaucoup de postes de ce niveau \u00e0 combler ; qu'\u00e0 chaque ann\u00e9e, il devait y avoir de 10 \u00e0 12 postes qui devenaient disponibles. Pour sa part, il n'avait aucune crainte qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 facile en tout temps de trouver un nouveau poste pour la plaignante.\n[77] Toutefois, les ressources humaines pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e8rent laisser aller les choses et ne rien pr\u00e9cipiter, c'est-\u00e0-dire laisser la plaignante effectuer elle-m\u00eame ses d\u00e9marches. D'ailleurs, elle avait manifest\u00e9 lors de la rencontre du mois de janvier 2003 avec la Vice-Pr\u00e9sidente de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement et plus tard au cours d'une seconde entrevue du directeur des ressources humaines et de la plaignante, une pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour un poste de niveau administratif, au motif que c'\u00e9tait davantage conforme \u00e0 ses qualifications et son exp\u00e9rience. En attendant de trouver ce qu'elle cherchait, elle continuait de recevoir un salaire et de travailler ; il n'y avait donc aucune urgence \u00e0 pr\u00e9cipiter les choses.\n[78] Le Directeur des ressources humaines est venu dire au tribunal qu'en donnant du temps \u00e0 la plaignante et en ne lui mettant aucune pression, elle aurait des chances de se trouver un poste qui pourrait davantage lui convenir.\n[79] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de la personne qui avait remplac\u00e9 la vice-pr\u00e9sidence de la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres, il faut au moins 6 mois avant qu'un employ\u00e9, qui a soumis des demandes d'emploi, puisse assister \u00e0 des entrevues, et obtenir des r\u00e9sultats. L'engagement de l'intim\u00e9e consistait \u00e0 aider les employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s par la fermeture de l'unit\u00e9 \u00e0 se trouver un poste de m\u00eame groupe et niveau et non \u00e0 leur trouver un emploi de niveau sup\u00e9rieur; or, la plaignante semblait davantage int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 un travail de niveau administratif, ce qu'elle jugeait \u00eatre plus conforme \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience et \u00e0 ses qualifications, mais, dans les faits, ceci signifiait qu'elle \u00e9tait davantage int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par un poste de niveau sup\u00e9rieur.\n[80] Il prit les moyens pour qu'une personne lui donne de la formation en mati\u00e8re de finances ; toutefois la plaignante se plaignit que cette formation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 insuffisante, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 le peu de disponibilit\u00e9 des formateurs.\n[81] Deux personnes ont accept\u00e9 de remettre une lettre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[82] Selon le directeur des ressources humaines, le nom de la plaignante fut mis sur une liste de priorit\u00e9 par les ressources humaines et les gestionnaires \u00e0 l'interne furent ainsi inform\u00e9s de sa disponibilit\u00e9.\n[83] La plaignante continua de travailler pour le vice-pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement jusqu'\u00e0 la fermeture de la Direction \u00e0 la fin d'octobre 2003. Avant son d\u00e9part, celui-ci signa le 30 septembre 2003 une Entente d'affectation couvrant la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er septembre au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[84] Le directeur des ressources humaines all\u00e9gua que, suite \u00e0 la fermeture \u00e0 la fin d'octobre 2003 de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement, les ressources humaines poursuivirent l'approche suivie lors de la fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux en ce qui concernait l'aide \u00e0 \u00eatre apport\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s qui avaient perdu leur emploi; c'est donc dire qu'ils laiss\u00e8rent les employ\u00e9s effectuer eux-m\u00eames des d\u00e9marches pour se trouver un nouveau poste. Il en fut ainsi pour la plaignante jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de 2003.\n[85] Voici d'ailleurs l'\u00e9clairage additionnel qu'un t\u00e9moin retrait\u00e9 depuis 2008, apr\u00e8s 37 ann\u00e9es \u00e0 la Fonction publique, \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Direction de la gestion int\u00e9gr\u00e9e est venu apporter lors de l'audience. Il expliqua quelle approche a privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 la Commission de la fonction publique et a mis de l'avant pour transformer et moderniser la CFP et que cette approche fut appliqu\u00e9e dans le cas de la plaignante.\n[86] Au moment de la r\u00e9organisation de la CFP, cette personne avait alors \u00e0 sa charge environ 1 400 employ\u00e9s. Avec son \u00e9quipe, il proc\u00e9da \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction des deux documents suivants : PSC Transformation Realigning for Modernization - Backgrounder R-1, onglet 2 et PSC Transformation Realigning for Modernization - Questions & Answers R-1, onglet 2.\n[87] Ce dernier document, qui indiquait sur sa page frontispice Pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le secr\u00e9tariat de la Transformation (Transformation Secretariate), 18 f\u00e9vrier 2003, fut distribu\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le personnel de la CFP et, normalement, il devrait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 la plaignante.\n[88] Il \u00e9tait clair pour tous les intervenants que la modernisation de la fonction publique ne passait pas par un processus de r\u00e9duction des effectifs en place. C'est l'assurance qu'ils transmirent \u00e0 tous. Voici un extrait pertinent de la page 10 des Questions et r\u00e9ponses (R-1, onglet 5 :\nQ. Will all PSC staff have jobs after the April 1 reorganization?\nA. The April 1 reorganization is not a job reduction exercise. In the unforeseen circumstance of reductions, we will identify opportunities for employment elsewhere in the PSC, opportunities for retraining, as well as provide employee assistance and career counselling. In some cases, we may also look to other departments. Although it is not anticipated, if it becomes necessary, the Treasury Board Workforce Adjustment Directives will apply....\n[89] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 les craintes soulev\u00e9es par la plaignante, qui d\u00e9plora avoir pass\u00e9 de longues p\u00e9riodes de temps sans avoir en main une Entente d'affectation \u00e9crite, le directeur des ressources humaines fut invit\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser sa position sur ce sujet.\n[90] Il indiqua que l'assignation \u00e9crite avait notamment un avantage purement d'ordre administratif en d\u00e9terminant qui de l'Organisme d'attache, de l'Organisme d'accueil ou de la r\u00e9serve corporative devait payer l'employ\u00e9. D'ailleurs, il s'empressa de pr\u00e9ciser que la plaignante continua de recevoir son salaire m\u00eame au cours des p\u00e9riodes o\u00f9 elle se trouva sans Entente d'affectation \u00e9crite. Dans les faits il suffit qu'il y ait une entente verbale entre l'employ\u00e9 et le gestionnaire de l'Organisme d'attache et de l'Organisme d'accueil.\n[91] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres a expliqu\u00e9 que l'absence d'Entente d'affectation \u00e9crite \u00e9tait normale et qu'il \u00e9tait courant d'accorder \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s des assignations non \u00e9crites. Il pr\u00e9cisa que les gestionnaires signaient parfois des assignations \u00e9crites afin de rassurer des employ\u00e9s inquiets ou lorsqu'il y avait une m\u00e9fiance entre gestionnaires.\n[92] Il fut d\u00e9montr\u00e9 au cours de l'audience que la plaignante a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'une Entente d'affectation \u00e9crite au cours des p\u00e9riodes allant du 1er avril au 30 juin 2003 et du 1er septembre au 31 d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[93] Lorsque questionn\u00e9 sur la fa\u00e7on avec laquelle les employ\u00e9s se trouvaient un nouvel emploi, le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de la Direction de la gestion int\u00e9gr\u00e9e de l'\u00e9poque pr\u00e9cisa qu'il y avait trois fa\u00e7ons :\nLe transfert en bloc d'un groupe de personnes et de leur fonction ; ce fut le cas des employ\u00e9s du Language training Canada, qui apr\u00e8s avoir fait partie de la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres furent transf\u00e9r\u00e9s en bloc ailleurs dans la Fonction publique. Les employ\u00e9s qui se trouvaient de l'emploi par leurs propres moyens ; ce fut le cas du personnel de l'unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux, sauf pour madame Gravel. Bien entendu, on apportait peu ou pas d'aide \u00e0 ces personnes. Les employ\u00e9s incapables de se trouver un emploi par leurs propres moyens, tels que madame Gravel, et qui, par cons\u00e9quent, avaient besoin d'un soutien additionnel.\n[94] Il expliqua qu'il fit avec madame Gravel ce qu'ils faisaient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pour les employ\u00e9s de cette derni\u00e8re cat\u00e9gorie. En plus du fait qu'elle continuait de recevoir son salaire, il lui donna moins de travail pour lui permettre de consacrer plus de temps et d'\u00e9nergies \u00e0 se d\u00e9nicher un nouvel emploi ; il lui donna acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un bureau ferm\u00e9 \u00e9quip\u00e9 d'un t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et d'un ordinateur avec acc\u00e8s au courrier \u00e9lectronique. Il lui donna une lettre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence (R-1, onglet 3). Aucune pression n'aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise sur la plaignante ; il se dit conscient que pour soumettre sa candidature \u00e0 une comp\u00e9tition, le processus pouvait prendre plus de six mois.\n[95] Dans les faits, la plaignante soumit sa candidature \u00e0 trois comp\u00e9titions ; malheureusement, elle ne put obtenir de poste par le biais de ces comp\u00e9titions.\n[96] Le t\u00e9moin d\u00e9clara n'\u00eatre pas en mesure d'indiquer de combien de temps disposait la plaignante pour se trouver un emploi. Cette question n'aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e avant son d\u00e9part de la Direction de la gestion int\u00e9gr\u00e9e, qui eut lieu \u00e0 la fin d'octobre 2003. Il ajouta n\u00e9anmoins qu'il imaginait qu'une p\u00e9riode d'un an ou plus serait normale.\n[97] Il n'y avait de pression financi\u00e8re ni sur la plaignante ni sur sa direction, puisque le salaire de la plaignante \u00e9tait assum\u00e9 par la r\u00e9serve corporative.\n[98] Questionn\u00e9 sur l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante, il r\u00e9pondit que cette question n'avait aucune importance pour lui. De toute fa\u00e7on, il ignorait l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante. Il lui arrivait souvent de conna\u00eetre l'\u00e2ge des employ\u00e9s puisqu'en tant qu'ing\u00e9nieur, il signait la demande de passeport de certains employ\u00e9s qui le lui demandaient mais, ce ne fut pas le cas de la plaignante.\n[99] Questionn\u00e9 sur sa relation avec la plaignante, il r\u00e9pondit que leur relation de travail fut plaisante mais peu fr\u00e9quente au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 5 mois o\u00f9 ils travaill\u00e8rent dans le m\u00eame bureau. Questionn\u00e9 sur sa performance, il pr\u00e9cisa que le travail demand\u00e9 \u00e9tait bien fait et ignorait qu'elle ait pu avoir un handicap quelconque. Il n'aurait jamais re\u00e7u de demande d'accommodement de sa part. Il n'a jamais eu besoin de consulter le dossier personnel de la plaignante et bien entendu, ignorait l'existence d'un certificat m\u00e9dical \u00e9mis en 2001 qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9 dans son dossier et qui aurait fait mention de la fibromyalgie de la plaignante. Il pr\u00e9cisa que ce n'\u00e9tait pas une pratique courante pour les gestionnaires d'aller consulter le dossier personnel des employ\u00e9s.\n[100] Toutefois, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de 2004, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le sort de la plaignante n'avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 scell\u00e9 et que celle-ci n'avait pu se d\u00e9nicher un emploi permanent par ses propres moyens, le bureau des ressources humaine d\u00e9cida de prendre la situation en main. Il songeait m\u00eame de d\u00e9clarer la plaignante employ\u00e9e exc\u00e9dentaire d\u00e8s mars 2004.\nB. Personne aux Ressources humaines ne r\u00e9pondait aux messages de la plaignante [101] La plaignante a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises et de diverses fa\u00e7ons qu'elle s'\u00e9tait adress\u00e9e r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement au bureau des ressources humaines pour avoir de l'aide de son directeur, en y laissant des messages t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, parfois quotidiennement, et des courriels, \u00e0 son attention mais que jamais personne n'aurait fait le suivi.\n[102] Elle d\u00e9clara s'\u00eatre rendue en personne au bureau des Ressources humaines et demand\u00e9 de l'aide. On lui aurait r\u00e9pondu que le directeur la rappellerait. Elle n'aurait par la suite re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse.\n[103] Lorsque le Directeur des ressources humaines fut confront\u00e9 \u00e0 cette accusation de la plaignante, il nia cat\u00e9goriquement avoir re\u00e7u des messages de la part de la plaignante et ne pas y avoir donn\u00e9 suite. Il pr\u00e9cisa que cette accusation n'avait pas de sens et que, s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 d'y r\u00e9pondre, il lui aurait suffi de transmettre le message \u00e0 un des employ\u00e9s et de lui demander de faire le suivi.\nC. Traitement d\u00e9favorable [104] La plaignante d\u00e9plora que les autres employ\u00e9s, plus jeunes qu'elle, qui se d\u00e9nich\u00e8rent un nouveau poste ont re\u00e7u un traitement privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 par rapport au sien.\n[105] Le tribunal se rend compte que la preuve recueillie ne lui a pas permis de conna\u00eetre le statut pr\u00e9cis des autres employ\u00e9s de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux : avaient-ils un statut d'employ\u00e9 touch\u00e9, travaillaient-ils en ayant en main une entente d'affectation \u00e9crite ou sans affectation, aucune preuve n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 cet effet.\n[106] La seule pr\u00e9cision que nous avons est celle du Directeur des ressources humaines qui est venu affirmer qu'\u00e0 sa connaissance, la plupart s'\u00e9taient trouv\u00e9 un emploi par leurs propres moyens.\n[107] Malgr\u00e9 les pr\u00e9cisions apport\u00e9es par l'employeur concernant l'\u00e2ge des autres employ\u00e9s de cette unit\u00e9, il appara\u00eet que tous et chacun de ces employ\u00e9s sauf ceux qui ont d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 pour prendre leur retraite, \u00e9taient plus jeunes que la plaignante et m\u00eame, pour la plupart beaucoup plus jeunes que la plaignante.\nD. Les ressources humaines ignor\u00e8rent l'exp\u00e9rience, les qualifications et les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la plaignante [108] La plaignante s'effor\u00e7a de d\u00e9montrer ses qualifications et son exp\u00e9rience, d'ailleurs \u00e9tal\u00e9es dans son Curriculum Vitae, et d\u00e9plora que les ressources humaines ne firent rien pour lui trouver un poste qui en aurait tenu compte.\n[109] Elle a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au tribunal, lettres de recommandation \u00e0 l'appui et d\u00fbment d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au dossier du tribunal, que son travail \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 de tous. Elle r\u00e9p\u00e9ta \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu'elle \u00e9tait fi\u00e8re de ses r\u00e9alisations.\n[110] Elle reconnut que son travail a pu laisser \u00e0 d\u00e9sirer mais seulement pour une courte de p\u00e9riode de temps de 4 \u00e0 5 semaines, \u00e0 partir du 8 mars 2004 ; elle se justifia en all\u00e9guant que, suite \u00e0 une invalidit\u00e9 qui avait dur\u00e9 du 19 janvier au 8 mars 2004, sous la pression du Directeur du ressourcement des cadres, elle \u00e9tait revenue au travail beaucoup trop rapidement. De plus, le poste de Coordonnateur de programme \u00e9tant nouveau pour elle, il lui fallait recevoir de la formation, ce qui ne fut pas fait \u00e0 son enti\u00e8re satisfaction, faute de disponibilit\u00e9 des formateurs.\n[111] Elle a notamment fait entendre un t\u00e9moin maintenant \u00e0 la retraite, qui est venu dire au tribunal qu'il avait connu la plaignante au MAECI \u00e0 compter de l'an 2000. Il pr\u00e9cisa qu'elle avait remplac\u00e9 son adjointe administrative et qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 enti\u00e8rement satisfait de ses services, tant et si bien que lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux en 2001, il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de le suivre, ce qu'elle fit. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 il a travaill\u00e9 avec elle, il n'a jamais entendu qui que ce soit se plaindre de la plaignante ou entendu dire que celle-ci aurait pu \u00eatre malhonn\u00eate.\n[112] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 4 \u00e0 5 semaines que la plaignante passa dans sa direction, soit entre le 8 mars et le 14 avril 2004, le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement retint d'elle qu'elle \u00e9tait toujours tr\u00e8s amicale m\u00eame lorsqu'il lui faisait des recommandations, respectueuse, positive, souriait beaucoup, offrait de l'aider, lui offrit m\u00eame d'\u00eatre son adjointe; il d\u00e9clara n'avoir pu donner suite \u00e0 cette demande, car d'autres arrangements avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 faits \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'organisation.\n[113] Les t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir le Directeur des ressources humaines, le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement et le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres de l'\u00e9poque \u00e9taient tous du m\u00eame avis, la plaignante \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche d'un poste de niveau administratif et non de nature cl\u00e9ricale, ce qu'elle jugeait \u00eatre davantage conforme \u00e0 son exp\u00e9rience et \u00e0 ses qualifications; la plaignante elle-m\u00eame l'a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises.\n[114] Or, selon ces m\u00eames t\u00e9moins, ce que la plaignante recherchait \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 une promotion alors que les r\u00e8gles adopt\u00e9es dans le cadre de la modernisation de la Commission de la fonction publique pr\u00e9voyaient le transfert des employ\u00e9s au m\u00eame groupe et niveau. La plaignante avait \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9e au niveau CR-5 : un niveau cl\u00e9rical.\nE. L'intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait au courant de la fibromyalgie de la plaignante et a refus\u00e9 de faire les accommodements n\u00e9cessaires [115] Le directeur des projets sp\u00e9ciaux de l'\u00e9poque a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet qu'en 2001, madame ( ... ), alors sa sup\u00e9rieure imm\u00e9diate, lui aurait demand\u00e9 de classer au dossier de la plaignante une note provenant du m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante, dat\u00e9e de juin 2001, faisant allusion \u00e0 sa fibromyalgie. Il se rappelle aussi que suite \u00e0 la production de cette note, celle-ci aurait modifi\u00e9 la t\u00e2che de travail de la plaignante pour tenir compte de sa fibromyalgie et lui aurait confi\u00e9 moins d'entr\u00e9es de donn\u00e9es et plus de travail de secr\u00e9tariat.\n[116] Questionn\u00e9 afin de savoir s'il lui \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 arriv\u00e9 d'\u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 une demande d'accommodement de la part d'un employ\u00e9 affect\u00e9 d'un handicap quelconque, il a r\u00e9pondu par l'affirmative en pr\u00e9cisant que \u00e7a s'\u00e9tait d'ailleurs produit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Toutefois, il a tenu \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser qu'il n'est pas suffisant d'\u00eatre \u00e0 l'\u00e9coute de son personnel et de l'observer mais qu'il fallait que l'employ\u00e9 s'adresse \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur et lui fasse part de son besoin en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement.\n[117] La plaignante d\u00e9plora que le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres, qui \u00e9tait au courant de sa fibromyalgie aurait refus\u00e9 d'en tenir compte lorsqu'on lui accorda le poste de Coordonnateur de programme. Pourtant ce poste qui exigeait beaucoup de travail de dactylographie n'\u00e9tait pas convenable pour une personne comme elle, qui avait une condition de fibromyalgie.\n[118] Elle all\u00e9gua avoir inform\u00e9 le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres lors de sa conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de janvier 2004 qu'il y avait dans son dossier personnel un certificat de son m\u00e9decin de famille r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 2001 all\u00e9guant sa fibromyalgie. Elle all\u00e9gua lui avoir parl\u00e9 de cet handicap au cours de leurs conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques de janvier et f\u00e9vrier 2004.\n[119] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres ignora avoir alors \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par la plaignante de l'existence de sa fibromyalgie.\nF. Le poste d'adjointe-administrative aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre offert \u00e0 la plaignante plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 madame C. J. [120] La plaignante d\u00e9plora ne pas s'\u00eatre fait offrir le poste d'Adjointe-administrative (Executive Assistant) aupr\u00e8s du vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement, alors que celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 madame C. J.. Elle pr\u00e9cisa que madame C. J. \u00e9tait plus jeune qu'elle. Elle aurait eu environ 28 ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et la plaignante 59.\n[121] Face \u00e0 ce reproche, le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident pr\u00e9cisa qu'il avait une meilleure connaissance de madame C. J. que de la plaignante, l'ayant vu fonctionner sur une p\u00e9riode de temps plus longue. Au cours des 5 mois qu'il passa la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement, il \u00e9tait en contact quotidien avec madame C. J.\n[122] \u00c0 cause de ses absences fr\u00e9quentes du bureau, il rencontra la plaignante beaucoup moins souvent. Il garda cependant d'elle le souvenir d'une personne plaisante qui a toujours bien fait son travail.\n[123] Il trouva que l'exp\u00e9rience de la plaignante, qui avait travaill\u00e9 principalement aux Affaires ext\u00e9rieures, \u00e9tait moins utile \u00e0 la Commission de la fonction publique qui avait r\u00e9duit quasi \u00e0 n\u00e9ant son implication en mati\u00e8re internationale.\n[124] Il se rappela que la Vice-Pr\u00e9sidente qui l'avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e avait emmen\u00e9 madame C. J. pour travailler dans sa direction en tant que CR-4 par int\u00e9rim. En f\u00e9vrier 2003, peu de temps avant son arriv\u00e9e,, elle avait nomm\u00e9e madame C. J. AS-5 par int\u00e9rim pour une p\u00e9riode d'un an.\n[125] Au cours des 5 mois qu'il passa \u00e0 la Direction, en tant que vice-pr\u00e9sident, madame C. J. coordonnait ses activit\u00e9s professionnelles (work life) et faisait un excellent travail.\n[126] En juillet 2003, il offrit \u00e0 madame C. J. d'agir comme AS-2 par int\u00e9rim pour quelques mois et elle accepta. Celle-ci accomplissait alors les fonctions du poste depuis qu'elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler pour la Vice-Pr\u00e9sidente, sans toutefois avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue comme tel.\n[127] Comme il s'agissait d'un poste d'une dur\u00e9e de quelques mois seulement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la Direction \u00e9tait \u00e0 la veille de fermer ses portes, et que ce poste \u00e9tait sans issue, il d\u00e9cida d'offrir le poste \u00e0 madame C. J. sans passer par le processus de la comp\u00e9tition, comme c'\u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement la pratique dans de tels cas. N\u00e9anmoins, il opta pour une p\u00e9riode d'appel de 3 semaines, alors qu'il aurait pu opter pour une p\u00e9riode plus courte. Ni la plaignante ni personne d'autre n'en appela.\n[128] Le poste qui fut confi\u00e9 \u00e0 madame C. J. en \u00e9tait un de niveau AS-2, alors que la plaignante d\u00e9tenait un CR-5 ; passer de CR-5 \u00e0 AS-2 repr\u00e9sentait une promotion. Or, les engagements pris par la CFP dans le cadre de la modernisation se limitaient au replacement des employ\u00e9s au m\u00eame groupe et niveau.\n[129] L'intim\u00e9e, bien que la plaignante \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e priorit\u00e9, n'\u00e9tait nullement oblig\u00e9e d'offrir le poste \u00e0 la plaignante puisqu'il s'agissait d'un poste d'un niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que celui de CR-5. Questionn\u00e9 \u00e0 savoir si la plaignante s'\u00e9tait montr\u00e9e int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par le poste confi\u00e9 \u00e0 madame C. J., le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident indiqua que la r\u00e9ponse n'\u00e9tait pas claire mais, qu'il se rappelait qu'elle aurait aim\u00e9 le suivre \u00e0 son nouveau bureau, \u00e0 Industrie Canada. Il ne put pr\u00e9ciser s'il elle avait exprim\u00e9 ce souhait de fa\u00e7on explicite ou non.\n[130] Finalement, le tribunal n'a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 aucun document ni entendu aucun t\u00e9moin qui aurait pu d\u00e9montrer que la plaignante avait fait une demande pour occuper le poste occup\u00e9 par madame C.J.. Il en sera ainsi pour le poste qu'occupera madame C.J. \u00e0 Industrie Canada.\n[131] Questionn\u00e9 sur le transfert de madame C.J., qui le suivit \u00e0 Industrie Canada, le Vice-Pr\u00e9sient pr\u00e9cisa que lorsqu'il se rendit \u00e0 Industrie Canada en septembre 2003, il d\u00e9cida d'observer d'abord les lieux et d'analyser la situation avant de d\u00e9cider du genre de personnel dont il pourrait avoir besoin.\n[132] Il se rendit compte qu'il aurait besoin d'une adjointe qui serait du type fonceur avec une exp\u00e9rience en affaires ; le milieu \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s difficile et les occasions de conflits fr\u00e9quentes. Il lui sembla que madame C.J. avait les qualit\u00e9s n\u00e9cessaires pour bien combler ce poste. Jusqu'alors, il n'aurait fait aucune promesse \u00e0 celle-ci. Ce n'est qu'apr\u00e8s son \u00e9valuation et qu'il \u00e9tait rendu \u00e0 Industrie Canada qu'il offrit le poste \u00e0 madame C.J..\n[133] Suite aux explications fournies par le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident, la plaignante se permit d'ajouter un commentaire, alors qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas en train de t\u00e9moigner mais de compl\u00e9ter son contre-interrogatoire :\nI would like to agree with your statement, now that you said the job was like at Industry Canada, knowing (C.J.) I agree with you completely.\n[134] En vertu des pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s au membre instructeur par l'article 50 (3) (c) de la Loi, j'admets en preuve ce commentaire de la plaignante qui m'a sembl\u00e9 signifier que la plaignante affirmait alors que madame C.J. lui semblait plus comp\u00e9tente qu'elle pour occuper ce poste.\n[135] Il serait utile ici de faire un rappel des explications d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournies par le Directeur des ressources humaines concernant l'approche concentrique pr\u00e9conis\u00e9e dans les r\u00e8gles de fonctionnement de la Commission de la fonction publique pour le replacement du personnel. Il fallait d'abord tenter de replacer l'employ\u00e9 dans son Unit\u00e9 de travail, puis dans sa Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, puis dans son Minist\u00e8re puis \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Minist\u00e8re.\n[136] Ainsi, le poste qui fut occup\u00e9 par madame C.J. \u00e0 Industrie Canada s'\u00e9tait ouvert \u00e0 l'ext\u00e9rieur du Minist\u00e8re. Par cons\u00e9quent, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9matur\u00e9 pour la plaignante de pr\u00e9tendre pouvoir exiger un poste \u00e0 Industrie Canada. De surcro\u00eet, le poste en question aurait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une promotion dans son cas.\nG. L'intim\u00e9e est responsable d'avoir faussement r\u00e9pandu la nouvelle de sa retraite [137] La plaignante a d\u00e9plor\u00e9 que le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres ait envoy\u00e9 au Directeur des ressources humaines le 13 mai 2004 un courriel, produit au dossier comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce C-1 (6) qui contenait une fausse information ; voici l'extrait de ce texte qu'elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre fausse :\nElle me dit vouloir prendre sa retraite d\u00e8s qu'elle aura 60 ans le 29 juin 2004, racheter 10 ans de service et ne pas pouvoir revenir travailler d'ici l\u00e0.\n[138] La plaignante tint \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser qu'elle n'avait pas fourni ce renseignement \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat puisqu'\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque elle n'avait pas encore pris la d\u00e9cision de d\u00e9missionner.\n[139] La plaignante fit \u00e9galement t\u00e9moigner une conseill\u00e8re en r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et avantages sociaux ; celle-ci est venu expliquer notamment que la plaignante lui avait demand\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sur son dossier mais n'avait nullement indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle lui avait fait part de sa d\u00e9cision de prendre sa retraite. Elle pr\u00e9cisa \u00e9galement que c'\u00e9tait d'ailleurs ce qui expliquait que la lettre qu'elle avait fait parvenir \u00e0 la plaignante le 28 mars 2004 ne portait pas d'en-t\u00eate officiel. Voir la pi\u00e8ce C-1, onglet 25.\n[140] Nous sommes d'avis que l'erreur que la plaignante a relev\u00e9e dans le courriel du Directeur du ressourcement des cadres n'a eu aucune cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9gative pour la plaignante. En effet, le poste qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 offert en janvier 2004 a \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenu jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la plaignante d\u00e9missionne en janvier 2005.\nH. L'intim\u00e9e est responsable de la d\u00e9mission de la plaignante [141] La plaignante reprocha \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de l'avoir trait\u00e9e, \u00e0 partir de la fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux puis de la Direction de l'apprentissage, de mani\u00e8re telle qu'elle fut forc\u00e9e de d\u00e9missionner en janvier 2005, soit 5 ans plus t\u00f4t qu'anticip\u00e9.\n[142] Pour bien \u00e9valuer cette accusation, nous devons avoir en t\u00eate que dans sa lettre de d\u00e9mission, la plaignante fait porter tout le bl\u00e2me sur la compagnie d'assurance. Elle ne porte alors aucune accusation contre son employeur \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de qui elle portera pourtant devant la Commission des droits de la personne de s\u00e9rieuses accusations de discrimination.\n[143] Au cours de l'audience, questionn\u00e9e sur ce fait jug\u00e9 \u00e9trange, la plaignante a tenu \u00e0 expliquer que si sa lettre de d\u00e9mission ne contenait aucune accusation contre l'intim\u00e9e, c'est qu'elle agissait par diplomatie dans un milieu qui pourtant ne connaissait pas ce mot. Il nous semble que la plaignante aurait pu d\u00e9missionner et faire preuve de diplomatie sans pour autant bl\u00e2mer la compagnie d'assurance.\n[144] O\u00f9 se trouve la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 : lorsque la plaignante a \u00e9crit sa lettre ou lorsqu'elle est venue t\u00e9moigner ? Nous croyons plus probable que la plaignante a identifi\u00e9 la cause de ses probl\u00e8mes au moment o\u00f9 elle a \u00e9crit sa lettre de d\u00e9mission. Ce n'est que lorsqu'elle aurait appris l'existence d'un recours \u00e0 la Loi sur les droits de la personne qu'elle s'est rendue compte que le recours n'\u00e9tait ouvert que contre l'employeur et non contre la compagnie d'assurance. Que de plus, ce recours ne lui \u00e9tait disponible qu'en autant que son employeur aurait pos\u00e9 un geste discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 interdit par cette loi.\nI. L'intim\u00e9e est responsable de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la sant\u00e9 de la plaignante [145] Au cours de l'audience, la plaignante d\u00e9plora que le traitement que lui avait fait subir l'intim\u00e9e, la Commission de la fonction publique, en 2003 et 2004 \u00e9tait la cause principale de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de sa sant\u00e9.\n[146] Pour mieux d\u00e9montrer cette affirmation, la plaignante fit t\u00e9moigner un membre de sa famille imm\u00e9diate. Celui-ci est venu raconter au tribunal que ce que la plaignante lui avait rapport\u00e9 suite \u00e0 quelques conversations t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques qu'elle aurait eues avec son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat. Il reconnut cependant n'avoir jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent lors de ces conversations. Il a d\u00e9crit l'\u00e9tat de la plaignante, \u00e0 la suite de ces conversations comme \u00e9tant celui d'une personne f\u00e2ch\u00e9e. Elle lui aurait expliqu\u00e9 que depuis la fermeture de son unit\u00e9 de travail, elle se trouvait dans une situation d'instabilit\u00e9 et que le poste qu'on lui avait offert ne lui convenait pas. Elle en serait ressortie boulevers\u00e9e.\n[147] D'autre part, le rapport m\u00e9dical du psychiatre de la plaignante, suite \u00e0 l'examen de sa patiente en novembre 2004, et produit au soutien des pr\u00e9sentes comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R-2, onglet 10 indique que d'autres facteurs d'ordre non professionnels peuvent expliquer en partie les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[148] Finalement, la lettre de d\u00e9mission de la plaignante produite comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 12 fait porter le bl\u00e2me sur les \u00e9paules de la compagnie d'assurance et n'adresse aucun reproche \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e. Voir plus haut ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit sur cette d\u00e9mission.\n[149] \u00c0 notre avis, les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de la plaignante peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 des facteurs d'ordre personnel et en grande partie aux difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es par la plaignante suite \u00e0 la fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux et de la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres. Reste \u00e0 voir s'il y eu faute de l'intim\u00e9e au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi.\nIV. CRIT\u00c8RES JURIDIQUES APPLICABLES [150] La plaignante, qui a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte de discrimination devant le Tribunal des droits de la personne, a dans un premier temps l'obligation de convaincre le tribunal de l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination de la part de l'intim\u00e9e. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et al. c. La municipalit\u00e9 d'Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202). Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, comme la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 discrimination bas\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge et la d\u00e9ficience, elle devra convaincre le tribunal que la preuve soumise, qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations faites, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante comme l'enseigne la Cour Supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28 :\n... Dans les instances devant un tribunal des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit faire une preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire qu'il y a discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9.\n[151] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, le tribunal doit se limiter \u00e0 l'analyse de la seule preuve tant testimoniale que documentaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante. Il doit faire abstraction de la preuve soumise par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9ponse. Voir \u00e0 cet effet Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd 2004 CAF 204 au par. 22 :\n[22] L'approche adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal et confirm\u00e9e par le juge du proc\u00e8s afin de d\u00e9cider si le demandeur avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination n'est pas appuy\u00e9e par la jurisprudence. La preuve prima facie produite par l'appelant \u00e9tablissait qu'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste de chef m\u00e9canicien sur le N.M. Princess of Acadia, qu'il poss\u00e9dait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour ce poste, qu'une autre personne avait obtenu le poste et que sa race avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e d'embaucher les autres candidats. Dans ces all\u00e9gations, l'appelant aurait pu \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, savoir une preuve : qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9 . Au lieu de d\u00e9cider si ces all\u00e9gations, si elles \u00e9taient crues, justifiaient un verdict favorable \u00e0 l'appelant, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement tenu compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e avant de conclure qu'une preuve prima facie n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Comme il d\u00e9coule clairement de l'arr\u00eat Etobicoke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 et de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, ce dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne joue aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[152] Si le tribunal juge qu'il y a absence d'une preuve prima facie par rapport \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel des all\u00e9gations ou juge la preuve soumise incompl\u00e8te ou insatisfaisante, il devra rejeter la plainte. Voir C.C.D.P. c. C.N. (2000) 38 C.H.R.R.D\/107 (C.F.). Dans les faits, c'est vraiment une question de savoir si chaque aspect essentiel de l'acte discriminatoire est appuy\u00e9 par un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[153] Par contre, s'il est d'avis qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, les cons\u00e9quences seront que le fardeau de la preuve se d\u00e9placera. Il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir des explications raisonnables ou satisfaisantes quant \u00e0 la pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire (Voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd, 2004 CAF 204 (CANLII), 2004 CAF 204, paragraphe 23 ; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (CANLII), 2005 caf 154, paragraphes 26 et 27).\n[154] Par ailleurs, la conduite d'un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire si celui-ci peut d\u00e9montrer que ses refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour qu'une pratique soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une EPJ, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[155] L'intim\u00e9e doit \u00e9galement prouver que la justification n'est pas un simple pr\u00e9texte pour masquer une pratique discriminatoire. Ainsi en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (P.G.) c. Lambie (1996) 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483.\n[156] Le degr\u00e9 de preuve exig\u00e9 pour juger de l'existence ou de la non-existence de la discrimination est celui qu'on exige dans les dossiers de nature civile, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de preuve. Les exigences d'une telle preuve sont moins grandes que celles exig\u00e9es devant un tribunal qui si\u00e8ge en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Voici ce que le tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Dawson c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes 2008 TCDP 41 au paragraphe 73 :\n[73] Cela dit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Wall c. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, [1997] C.C.D.P. no 6, la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination reste la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et, s'agissant de la preuve circonstancielle, le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carwell, 1987, page 142).\nV. QUELLES SONT LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [157] \u00c0 la lecture de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9e, qui porte sur la discrimination sur la base de son \u00e2ge et de sa d\u00e9ficience, voici ce qui nous appara\u00eet \u00eatre les questions en litige :\n1\u00e8re Question en litige\n\u00c0 l'occasion de la fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux le 30 juin 2003 et de la fermeture de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement le 31 Octobre 2003, l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi la plaignante en raison de son \u00e2ge au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi ?\n2e Question en litige\nAu moment o\u00f9 le poste de Coordonnateur de programme fut offert \u00e0 la plaignante et au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a occup\u00e9 ce poste, l'intim\u00e9e l'a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et, dans l'affirmative, a-t-elle satisfait \u00e0 son devoir d'accommodement au sens de l'article 15 de la Loi ?\n3e Question en litige\nEn novembre 2004, l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la plaignante en cours d'emploi sur la base de sa d\u00e9ficience, en ignorant ou en refusant d'acquiescer \u00e0 sa demande de reprendre le travail sur une base progressive et, dans l'affirmative, a-t-elle satisfait \u00e0 son devoir d'accommodement au sens de l'article 15 de la Loi?\n4e Question en litige\nL'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi la plaignante en raison de son \u00e2ge, en pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant accorder le poste d'adjointe-administrative \u00e0 madame C. J. plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 elle ? L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi la plaignante en raison de son \u00e2ge au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi ?\n5e Question en litige\nLes lignes de conduite de l'intim\u00e9e ont-elles annihil\u00e9 les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de la plaignante et ainsi ont-elles enfreint l'article 10 de la Loi ?\nA. 1\u00e8re Question en litige [158] \u00c0 l'occasion de la fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux le 30 juin 2003 et de la fermeture de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement le 31 octobre 2003, l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi la plaignante en raison de son \u00e2ge au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi ?\n(i) Preuve prima facie [159] Les repr\u00e9sentations de la plaignante sont \u00e0 l'effet qu'au 30 juin 2003, lorsque l'unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux fut ferm\u00e9e et au 31 octobre 2003, lorsque la Direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres de la C.F.P. ferma ses portes, elle continuait d'\u00eatre sans emploi alors que tous les autres employ\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'exception de ceux qui avaient pris leur retraite, tous beaucoup plus jeunes qu'elle, s'\u00e9taient trouv\u00e9 un emploi.\n[160] La plaignante d\u00e9montra que tous les autres employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'exception de ceux qui avaient pris leur retraite, \u00e9taient effectivement beaucoup plus jeunes qu'elle, qui avait 59 ans ; elle all\u00e9gua que tous, sauf elle, s'\u00e9taient trouv\u00e9 un emploi.\n[161] Elle d\u00e9montra, lettres de recommandation et t\u00e9moignages \u00e0 l'appui, que son travail ant\u00e9rieur tant au MAECI, qu'\u00e0 la Commission de la fonction publique, fut g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tr\u00e8s satisfaisant et que personne n'eut \u00e0 se plaindre de son rendement.\n[162] Elle all\u00e9gua \u00eatre d'avis que seul son \u00e2ge, 59 ans, avait jou\u00e9 contre elle et que de ce fait, l'intim\u00e9e avait fait preuve de discrimination sur la base de son \u00e2ge. Elle reprocha de plus \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de l'avoir n\u00e9glig\u00e9e, voire abandonn\u00e9e et avoir accord\u00e9 un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel aux autres employ\u00e9s plus jeunes qu'elle.\n[163] En l'absence d'explications pouvant justifier que la plaignante soit demeur\u00e9e sans emploi alors que son travail semblait pourtant satisfaisant, il nous appara\u00eet que l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante soit le seul motif pouvant expliquer cette situation.\n[164] Pour tous ces motifs, le tribunal est d'avis que la plaignante a fait une preuve prima facie que l'intim\u00e9e est responsable de discrimination sur la base de son \u00e2ge.\n(ii) La position de l'intim\u00e9e [165] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode commen\u00e7ant avec la fermeture de l'Unit\u00e9 des programmes internationaux et de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement et se terminant le jour o\u00f9 la plaignante a d\u00e9missionn\u00e9, celle-ci a continu\u00e9 de recevoir un salaire; elle a toujours occup\u00e9 un poste et s'est vue confier des t\u00e2ches jug\u00e9es \u00eatre de son niveau, sauf pour une p\u00e9riode de six semaines commen\u00e7ant au d\u00e9but de novembre et se terminant \u00e0 la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2003.\n[166] Il nous semble que cette p\u00e9riode de six semaines que la plaignante a pass\u00e9 seule dans un local vacant, qu'aucun des t\u00e9moins de l'intim\u00e9e incluant le chef des op\u00e9rations aux ressources humaines, n'a pu expliquer, repr\u00e9sente une situation des plus aberrante et inimaginable.\n[167] La preuve r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e ne nous permet cependant pas d'affirmer que cet incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e par l'un ou l'autre des agents de l'intim\u00e9e. N\u00e9anmoins, il s'agirait d'une maladresse et\/ou manquement impardonnable qui serait imputable aux ressources humaines. Compte tenu de tout ce que nous avons appris sur la plaignante, nous sommes d'avis qu'elle ne m\u00e9ritait certainement pas de subir un tel traitement.\n[168] Nous pouvons imaginer facilement l'angoisse et la d\u00e9prime que la plaignante peut avoir ressentie ou v\u00e9cue au cours de cette longue p\u00e9riode. Si un employeur voulait d\u00e9motiver ou d\u00e9truire un employ\u00e9, il n'y aurait pas de meilleure fa\u00e7on de le faire.\n[169] Malgr\u00e9 cette faute grave des agents de l'intim\u00e9e, nous ne pouvons relier ce geste ou plut\u00f4t cette absence de geste \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante.\n[170] Nous attachons peu d'importance au fait que la plaignante ait pass\u00e9 une grande p\u00e9riode de temps sans avoir en main une assignation \u00e9crite ; il nous est apparu que c'\u00e9tait une pratique courante qui, dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, n'entra\u00eena aucune cons\u00e9quence f\u00e2cheuse pour la plaignante.\n[171] Nous acceptons l'explication fournie par le directeur des ressources humaines \u00e0 l'effet que les ressources humaines ont accord\u00e9 une p\u00e9riode de temps d'environ un an \u00e0 la plaignante afin de lui permettre de trouver, par ses propres moyens, un nouveau poste, d'autant plus que le poste qui semblait l'int\u00e9resser le plus paraissait \u00eatre de la nature d'une promotion et que l'intim\u00e9e n'avait aucunement l'obligation d'agir en ce sens.\n[172] Nous consid\u00e9rons comme normal qu'apr\u00e8s s'\u00eatre rendues compte que l'approche suivie jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de 2003 n'avait pas permis \u00e0 la plaignante de se trouver un nouveau poste par ses propres moyens, les ressources humaines prirent la d\u00e9cision de prendre les choses en main et de mettre de la pression sur la plaignante pour lui trouver un nouveau poste. C'est ainsi que par l'entremise du Directeur du ressourcement des cadres, un poste fut offert \u00e0 la plaignante en janvier 2004.\n[173] L'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 l'effet que l'intim\u00e9e ne s'est pas occup\u00e9e d'elle et qu'on ne retournait pas ses appels nous para\u00eet loin d'\u00eatre exact. Nous tenons tout d'abord \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que l'intim\u00e9e ne peut agir que par son personnel. Pour ce motif, nous sommes d'avis que nous devons \u00e9valuer l'aide re\u00e7ue par la plaignante en prenant en consid\u00e9ration l'aide provenant de toutes ses sources, qu'il s'agisse des deux Vice-Pr\u00e9sidents \u00e0 la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et du perfectionnement, du conseiller strat\u00e9gique principal, de la Directrice g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Direction de l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la diversit\u00e9 et du Directeur du ressourcement des cadres.\n[174] Au cours de l'audience, nous avons \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de nous rendre compte qu'il y avait eu du travail d'effectu\u00e9 par les ressources humaines afin d'aider la plaignante \u00e0 se trouver un nouvel emploi. Bref, en admettant que les ressources humaines auraient pu ne pas avoir retourn\u00e9 les appels de la plaignante, ce qui fut contest\u00e9 par le directeur des ressources humaines, il nous semble que la plaignante a re\u00e7u de l'aide sous plusieurs formes.\n[175] Toutefois, nous sommes d'avis que la plaignante ne semblait pas en avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e en temps opportun.\n[176] C'est un fait que le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de la direction de l'apprentissage pour les cadres a affirm\u00e9 durant l'audience que tous les employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient sens\u00e9s avoir re\u00e7u le document PSC Transformation Realigning for Modernization - Questions & Answers pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet 2. Mais les ressources humaines se sont-elles donn\u00e9 la peine de rencontrer, de temps \u00e0 autre, la plaignante pour lui expliquer ce qu'ils avaient fait pour elle ? Lui ont-ils expliqu\u00e9 comment ils entendaient l'aider dans le futur ? Lui ont-ils bien expliqu\u00e9 la situation dans laquelle elle se trouvait ? Ont-ils offert de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses questions ? N'y a-t-il pas eu un probl\u00e8me de communication ?\n[177] Si tout ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit au cours de l'audience avait \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante en temps opportun, il n'y aurait probablement pas eu de plainte de d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ... ni d'audience et peut-\u00eatre que la plaignante aurait continu\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 la Fonction publique jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 65 ans.\n[178] Quant au traitement privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 aux autres employ\u00e9s qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 replac\u00e9s \u00e0 d'autres postes, aucune preuve n'en a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[179] En ce qui a trait au reproche adress\u00e9 par la plaignante \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l'effet qu'on aurait ignor\u00e9 ses exp\u00e9riences et ses qualifications. Il nous est apparu que ce reproche dissimulait le fait que la plaignante \u00e9tait davantage int\u00e9ress\u00e9e par un poste de niveau administratif que par un poste de niveau cl\u00e9rical ; il ne faut toutefois pas perdre de vue que la plaignante d\u00e9tenait un CR-5.\n[180] Elle ne pouvait donc pas reprocher \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de chercher \u00e0 lui accorder un poste de niveau cl\u00e9rical et de ne pas l'avoir aid\u00e9e \u00e0 se trouver un poste de niveau administratif. L'obligation de l'intim\u00e9e se limitait \u00e0 replacer la plaignante \u00e0 un poste de m\u00eame groupe et niveau.\n(iii) La conclusion [181] La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le tribunal est \u00e0 l'effet que l'intim\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait pas sans reproche. A titre d'exemple, la p\u00e9riode de 6 semaines que la plaignante a pass\u00e9 seule et le manque de communication, comme nous venons de l'expliquer.\n[182] Cependant, notre mandat ne nous permet pas d'agir dans de tels cas. Nous devons nous limiter \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu de la discrimination de la part de l'intim\u00e9e bas\u00e9e sur l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante, au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi.\n[183] Or, dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, nous concluons que l'intim\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 les reproches que nous lui avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 adress\u00e9s, n'a pas commis de discrimination sur la base de l'\u00e2ge de la plaignante.\nB. 2e Question en litige [184] Au moment o\u00f9 le poste de Coordonnateur de programme fut offert \u00e0 la plaignante et au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a occup\u00e9 ce poste, l'intim\u00e9e l'a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d'emploi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience et, dans l'affirmative, a-t-elle satisfait \u00e0 son devoir d'accommodement au sens de l'article 15 de la Loi ?\n(i) Preuve prima facie [185] La plaignante a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir inform\u00e9 le directeur du ressourcement des cadres au cours d'un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 janvier 2004 de l'existence de sa condition de fibromyalgie et que le poste qu'il lui offrait n'\u00e9tait pas compatible avec sa condition. Selon elle, il aurait ignor\u00e9 sa question. Elle l'aurait alors inform\u00e9 qu'il y avait dans son dossier une note de son m\u00e9decin de famille datant de 2001 \u00e0 l'effet qu'elle avait une condition de fibromyalgie.\n[186] Un des t\u00e9moins de la plaignante est venu d\u00e9clarer avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant de l'existence de cette note, l'ayant lui-m\u00eame d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au dossier de la plaignante. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, en 2001, la plaignante aurait b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d'arrangements sp\u00e9ciaux pour tenir compte de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[187] Craignant de perdre son emploi, la plaignante se sentit oblig\u00e9e d'accepter le poste offert et de retourner au travail. L'intim\u00e9e ne tint nullement compte de la demande d'accommodement de la plaignante.\n[188] Pour tous ces motifs, le tribunal est convaincu que la plaignante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a fait une preuve prima facie de discrimination bas\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) La position de l'intim\u00e9e [189] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres nia avoir entendu la plaignante faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 sa fibromyalgie lors de la conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 janvier 2004 ni en toute autre occasion. Il pr\u00e9cisa cependant ce qu'il aurait fait si la plaignante lui avait soumis une telle demande.\n[190] La plaignante d\u00e9clara lui avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 en f\u00e9vrier 2004, 2 semaines apr\u00e8s la conversation du 20 janvier. Elle donna l'impression qu'au cours de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique son interlocuteur l'a tellement effray\u00e9e qu'elle d\u00e9cida d'accepter son offre. Par contre, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la plaignante avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sign\u00e9 l'acceptation de ce poste le 21 janvier pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\n[191] \u00c9tant confront\u00e9 \u00e0 deux versions diam\u00e9tralement oppos\u00e9es, que faire ?\n[192] Pr\u00e9cisons en premier lieu que le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres \u00e9tant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 la retraite et en principe, n'ayant aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat en jeu, n'aurait pas int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 mentir d'autant plus que sa Direction a \u00e9t\u00e9 dissoute. Par contre, la plaignante a beaucoup \u00e0 gagner ou \u00e0 perdre.\n[193] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres aurait eu peu \u00e0 perdre en consentant des accommodements \u00e0 la plaignante. En fait, il aurait pu s'en faire une solide alli\u00e9e au moment de son retour au travail \u00e9ventuel.\n[194] Comment pouvait-elle dire dans cette m\u00eame lettre de f\u00e9vrier que le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres lui fit tellement peur au cours de cette conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu'elle aurait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retourner au travail et de signer le contrat de travail puisqu'elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 sign\u00e9 la R\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l'offre de nomination le 21 janvier pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent ?\n[195] Comment a-t-elle pu dans cette m\u00eame lettre de f\u00e9vrier, mentionner le nom des docteurs (X et Y), respectivement psychologue et psychiatre, alors qu'on discute d'accommodements reli\u00e9s \u00e0 la fibromyalgie de la plaignante ? Ce n'est qu'au cours de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 2004 que ces deux m\u00e9decins furent impliqu\u00e9s, une fois que le m\u00e9decin de famille de la plaignante aura indiqu\u00e9 que sa patiente \u00e9tait alors en d\u00e9pression.\n[196] Dans les circonstances, en pr\u00e9sence de deux versions contradictoire, nous retenons la version du Directeur du ressourcement des cadres puisque celle-ci nous semble plus cr\u00e9dible. Ainsi, nous sommes d'avis que la plaignante n'a pas inform\u00e9 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat que sa condition de fibromyalgie l'emp\u00eachait d'accomplir les t\u00e2ches du poste qu'on lui offrait et ne lui aurait pas demand\u00e9 d'accommodements.\n(iii) La conclusion [197] Dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, nous concluons que lorsque le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres a offert \u00e0 la plaignante le poste de Coordonnateur de programme, celle-ci ne l'a pas inform\u00e9 qu'elle ne pouvait remplir les fonctions rattach\u00e9es \u00e0 ce poste \u00e0 cause de sa fibromyalgie et n'a formul\u00e9 aucune demande d'accommodement. Nous tenons \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que la plaignante qui d\u00e9sire obtenir des accommodements a \u00e9galement des obligations \u00e0 remplir. Une de celles-ci \u00e9tant d'informer l'employeur de sa situation m\u00e9dicale et des besoins qui en d\u00e9coulent. Voir : Central Okanagan School District No. 23 v. Renaud (1992) 2 S.C.R. 970, pages 30 et 31.\n[198] Par cons\u00e9quent, nous jugeons que l'intim\u00e9e n'a pas fait preuve de discrimination sur la base de la d\u00e9ficience de la plaignante.\nC. 3e Question en litige [199] En novembre 2004, l'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la plaignante en cours d'emploi sur la base de sa d\u00e9ficience, en ignorant ou en refusant d'acquiescer \u00e0 sa demande de reprendre le travail sur une base progressive et, dans l'affirmative, a-t-elle satisfait \u00e0 son devoir d'accommodement au sens de l'article 15 de la Loi?\n(i) Preuve prima facie [200] La plaignante d\u00e9clara qu'au d\u00e9but de novembre 2004, les m\u00e9dicaments qu'elle prenait depuis quelque temps commen\u00e7aient \u00e0 avoir des effets positifs sur sa sant\u00e9. Les effets de sa d\u00e9pression commen\u00e7ant \u00e0 s'estomper.\n[201] Elle t\u00e9l\u00e9phona \u00e0 son sup\u00e9rieur imm\u00e9diat, le 8 novembre 2004, pour lui demander si elle pourrait reprendre le travail sur une base progressive, \u00e0 raison de 2 jours par semaine.\n[202] Celui-ci aurait refus\u00e9 cat\u00e9goriquement sa demande d'accommodement.\n[203] Pour tous ces motifs, le tribunal est d'avis que la plaignante a fait une preuve prima facie de la discrimination de l'intim\u00e9e bas\u00e9e sur sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) La position de l'intim\u00e9e [204] Le Directeur du ressourcement des cadres savait que la plaignante \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 d'invalidit\u00e9 pour cause de d\u00e9pression. Il all\u00e9gua lui avoir t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 en septembre 2004 pour s'enqu\u00e9rir de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Il se serait fait dire que ses m\u00e9decins ne voulaient pas qu'elle retourne au travail.\n[205] Toutefois, il nia avoir re\u00e7u un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de la plaignante le 8 novembre 2004.\n[206] Il r\u00e9it\u00e9ra ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par la plaignante qu'elle ne pouvait, \u00e0 cause de sa fibromyalgie, occuper le poste qu'il lui offrait et n'avoir re\u00e7u en aucun moment une demande d'accommodement de la plaignante.\n[207] Il d\u00e9clara n'avoir aucun souvenir que la plaignante aurait pu lui indiquer qu'elle se sentait assez bien pour retourner progressivement au travail en novembre et ce, malgr\u00e9 la recommandation de son psychiatre.\n[208] Aucun des rapports m\u00e9dicaux produits ne fut \u00e0 l'effet qu'au cours de la p\u00e9riode s'\u00e9tendant entre le mois de mai 2004 et le 31 mars 2005 la plaignante pouvait retourner au travail.\n[209] Aucun de ces rapports m\u00e9dicaux ne sugg\u00e9ra un retour progressif de la plaignante au travail.\n(iii) La conclusion [210] Les rapports m\u00e9dicaux de diff\u00e9rents m\u00e9decins d\u00e9montraient l'incapacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 travailler. Par cons\u00e9quent, les gestes pos\u00e9s par les repr\u00e9sentants de l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9taient justifi\u00e9s au sens de l'article 15 (2) de la Loi.\n[211] La plaignante n'a produit au dossier de la cour aucun rapport m\u00e9dical attestant sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 reprendre le travail de fa\u00e7on progressive au cours de la p\u00e9riode s'\u00e9coulant entre le mois de mai 2004 et le 31 mars 2005.\n[212] L'intim\u00e9e nie avoir re\u00e7u une demande de retour progressif suite \u00e0 sa d\u00e9pression et par cons\u00e9quent nie avoir refus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante une telle demande.\n[213] Pour ces motifs, nous sommes d'avis que la plaignante n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination sur la base de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nD. 4e Question en litige [214] L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi la plaignante en raison de son \u00e2ge, en pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant accorder le poste d'adjointe-administrative \u00e0 madame C. J. plut\u00f4t qu'\u00e0 elle ? L'intim\u00e9e a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 en cours d'emploi la plaignante en raison de son \u00e2ge au sens de l'article 7 de la Loi ?\n(i) La preuve prima facie [215] La plaignante d\u00e9plora ne pas s'\u00eatre fait offrir le poste d'Adjointe-administrative aupr\u00e8s du vice-pr\u00e9sident de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et de perfectionnement, alors que celui-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 Madame C.J., qui \u00e9tait plus jeune qu'elle. Madame C.J. aurait eu environ 28 ans \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque et la plaignante 59.\n[216] \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, le poste semble important. Madame C.J. est tr\u00e8s jeune pour occuper un tel poste. La plaignante a plusieurs ann\u00e9es d'exp\u00e9rience. La feuille de route de la plaignante semble avoir plus de poids.\n[217] Un seul facteur pourrait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 retenu contre elle : son \u00e2ge.\n[218] Pour tous ces motifs, le tribunal est d'avis que la plaignante a fait une preuve prima facie de la discrimination bas\u00e9e sur son \u00e2ge.\n(ii) La position de l'intim\u00e9e [219] Le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des programmes d'apprentissage et du perfectionnement all\u00e9gua ne pas se souvenir que la plaignante ait montr\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat quelconque pour le poste qui fut confi\u00e9e \u00e0 madame C.J. ; la plaignante n'a pas indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait soumis sa candidature \u00e0 ce poste ; elle ne serait pas pr\u00e9value du droit d'appel lorsque madame C.J. fut promue audit poste.\n[220] De par son statut d'employ\u00e9e touch\u00e9e, la plaignante n'\u00e9tait pas en mesure d'exiger de se faire accorder le poste de fa\u00e7on prioritaire puisqu'il s'agissait d'un poste de niveau plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le sien, donc, s'agissait d'une promotion.\n[221] Ce m\u00eame t\u00e9moin a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que madame C. J. avait la comp\u00e9tence pour occuper ce poste ainsi que celui qu'il a confi\u00e9 plusieurs semaines plus tard \u00e0 madame C. J. \u00e0 Industrie Canada. Dans ce dernier cas, la plaignante a m\u00eame ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 le choix du Vice-Pr\u00e9sident.\n[222] La plaignante ne pouvait pas invoquer le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait prioritaire \u00e0 Industrie Canada. Sa priorit\u00e9 se limitait au minist\u00e8re o\u00f9 elle travaillait.\n(iii) La conclusion [223] Pour ces motifs, nous sommes d'avis que la plaignante n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a fait preuve de discrimination sur la base de son \u00e2ge lorsque le Vice-Pr\u00e9sident a confi\u00e9 le poste \u00e0 madame C.J..\nE. 5e Question en litige [224] Les lignes de conduite de l'intim\u00e9e ont-elles annihil\u00e9 les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement de la plaignante et ainsi ont-elles enfreint l'article 10 de la Loi?\n(i) La preuve prima facie [225] La plainte sous \u00e9tude all\u00e9guait que l'intim\u00e9e avait fait montre de discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de la plaignante sur la base de son \u00e2ge et de sa d\u00e9ficience et ce, en contravention avec les articles 7 (Emploi) et 10 (Lignes de conduite discriminatoires) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[226] Au cours de l'audience de sa preuve, la plaignante n'a aucunement reproch\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 d'avoir appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard des lignes de conduite discriminatoires sur la base de l'\u00e2ge et de la d\u00e9ficience. En plus, elle n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve sugg\u00e9rant l'application de telles lignes de conduite de la part de l'intim\u00e9e.\n[227] Pour ces motifs, le tribunal est d'avis que la plaignante n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 par preuve prima facie que l'intim\u00e9e a appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard des lignes de conduite discriminatoires sur la base de son \u00e2ge ou de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n(ii) La conclusion [228] La plaignante n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l'intim\u00e9e a enfreint l'article 10 de la Loi.\nVI. QUEL EST LE REDRESSEMENT APPROPRI\u00c9? [229] Le tribunal a conclu que la plaignante n'a pu \u00e9tablir une preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9e, tant sur la base de son \u00e2ge que sur la base de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[230] Pour ce motif, le tribunal ne juge pas n\u00e9cessaire d'apporter quelque pr\u00e9cision que ce soit quant aux mesures de redressement.\nSign\u00e9 par R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 3 f\u00e9vrier 2010\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL :\nT1324\/5408\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE :\nShelley Ann Gravel c. la Commission de la fonction publique du Canada\nDATE ET LIEU DE L'AUDIENCE :\nle 14 au 18 septembre 2009\nOttawa (Ontario)\nDATE DE LA D\u00c9CISION DU TRIBUNAL :\nLe 3 f\u00e9vrier 2010\nONT COMPARU :\nShelley Ann Gravel\nPour elle m\u00eame\n(Aucune repr\u00e9sentation)\nPour la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne\nMarie Crowley Korinda McLaine\nPour l'intim\u00e9e",

La plainte Discrimination sur la base de son sexe - Traitement diff\u00e9rentiel - pratique discriminatoire.\n[1] La plaignante, Guylaine B\u00e9langer, est agente correctionnelle aupr\u00e8s du Service correctionnel du Canada (le SCC), un des deux intim\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et membre du Syndicat des agents correctionnels du Canada (le SACC), affili\u00e9 \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats nationaux (la CSN), l\u2019autre intim\u00e9.\n[2] La plaignante all\u00e9gua que le 26 juin 2006, au nom des agents correctionnels, le SACC a conclu avec le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor une convention collective et sign\u00e9 avec le SCC un document intitul\u00e9 Entente Globale; elle all\u00e9gua que cette Entente comportait une disposition discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des agentes correctionnelles comme elle qui, apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 aux services administratifs du SCC, sont devenues agentes correctionnelles aupr\u00e8s de ce m\u00eame organisme.\n[3] Elle all\u00e9gua que l\u2019adoption de l\u2019Entente Globale fut pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e d\u2019une campagne de d\u00e9nigrement dirig\u00e9e par des agents correctionnels masculins CX, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des femmes qui, comme elle, avaient d\u00e9tenu une classification CR avant de devenir agentes correctionnelles CX, ce qui aurait eu pour effet de les d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[4] La plaignante all\u00e9gua dans sa plainte qu\u2019en 1999, au moment o\u00f9 elle soumit sa candidature pour devenir agente correctionnelle, le SCC cherchait \u00e0 embaucher du personnel f\u00e9minin. Aucun document ne fut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au soutien de cet all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[5] Elle d\u00e9plora le fait que, suite \u00e0 la signature de l\u2019Entente Globale les ann\u00e9es de service pass\u00e9es aux services administratifs du SCC, jusque l\u00e0 reconnues par la Fonction Publique pour fins d\u2019octroi des vacances, cess\u00e8rent de lui \u00eatre reconnues; par la suite, seules ses ann\u00e9es de services comme agente correctionnelle lui furent reconnues.\n[6] Selon elle, l\u2019adoption de cette nouvelle r\u00e8gle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire sur la base de son sexe puisqu\u2019elle accorderait aux agents correctionnels CX, en large majorit\u00e9 des hommes, un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel favorable et ainsi discriminerait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes comme elle, ex-employ\u00e9es de bureau, qui d\u00e9tenaient une classification CR avant de recevoir une classification CX.\nII. Analyse des faits A. Les faits du pr\u00e9sent dossier (i) Historique de travail de la plaignante [7] Au moment o\u00f9 la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 20 novembre 2006, elle travaillait comme agente de correction avec classification CX au Centre R\u00e9gional de R\u00e9ception (CRR) \u00e0 Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines.\n[8] Elle avait d\u00e9but\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re au sein de la Fonction Publique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale (FP) le 16 avril 1989 au Service Correctionnel du Canada, pour le Minist\u00e8re du Solliciteur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. Elle travaillait alors comme commis de bureau et appartenait au groupe CR, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine.\n[9] En d\u00e9cembre 1999, elle r\u00e9orienta sa carri\u00e8re en se joignant, en tant qu\u2019agente correctionnelle, au groupe CX, \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, qui \u0153uvre pour le Service Correctionnel du Canada.\n[10] \u00c0 ses d\u00e9buts comme agente correctionnelle, en 1999, aux fins de partage des vacances, on lui reconnut toutes et chacune de ses ann\u00e9es de service consacr\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la FP depuis 1989. Il en fut ainsi jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2006. Elle continuait d\u2019\u00eatre membre de l\u2019Alliance de la Fonction Publique du Canada jusqu\u2019\u00e0 son remplacement par le SACC en 2001.\n(ii) Cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives du passage de CR \u00e0 CX [11] En 2001, les agents correctionnels avec classification CX du Canada, soit plus de 6 000, quitt\u00e8rent en bloc l\u2019Alliance de la Fonction Publique du Canada pour se joindre \u00e0 un nouveau syndicat affili\u00e9 \u00e0 la Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Syndicats Nationaux (CSN), connu et d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant le Syndicat des Agents Correctionnels du Canada (SACC).\n[12] Le SACC d\u00e9posa entre les mains du Conseil du tr\u00e9sor son projet de convention collective le 10 avril 2002.\n[13] Le 26 juin 2006, le SACC signait une premi\u00e8re convention collective avec le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et signait le m\u00eame jour avec le SCC un autre document identifi\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant l\u2019Entente Globale.\n[14] Les dispositions de l\u2019Entente Globale avaient pour objet de clarifier certaines dispositions de la convention collective des agents correctionnels CX.\n[15] Cette entente pr\u00e9voyait notamment une mesure qui est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, qu\u2019on retrouve \u00e0 l\u2019article 1-B-3, ci-apr\u00e8s reproduit:\n1-B-3\nLe choix des dates de vacances se fait selon toute m\u00e9thode qui fait l\u2019objet d\u2019entente au niveau local avant le 1er mars de chaque ann\u00e9e ou, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut d\u2019une entente, sur la base du nombre d\u2019ann\u00e9es de services depuis le moment o\u00f9 l\u2019employ\u00e9-e est devenu agent-e correctionel.\n[16] La plaignante \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que l\u2019article I-B-3 de l\u2019Entente Globale aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 suite aux pressions exerc\u00e9es sur le SACC par des agents masculins CX du CRR et que, pour sa part, le SCC aurait ferm\u00e9 les yeux sur ce tour de passe.\n[17] Elle all\u00e9gua qu\u2019au moment de prendre un vote sur le choix de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir les modalit\u00e9s de partage des vacances, les agents CX en majorit\u00e9 masculins, se seraient ligu\u00e9s pour voter contre les personnes anciennement CR, en tr\u00e8s grande majorit\u00e9 f\u00e9minines et que, dans un tel contexte, parce que les femmes \u00e9taient fortement minoritaires, elles n\u2019avaient aucune chance de faire valoir leur point de vue.\n[18] \u00c0 l\u2019automne de 2006, les membres du SACC de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du CRR, invit\u00e9s \u00e0 se prononcer sur le choix d\u2019une m\u00e9thode d\u2019application des cong\u00e9s annuels, tel que le pr\u00e9voyait l\u2019article 1-B-3 de l\u2019Entente Globale, adopt\u00e8rent une r\u00e9solution \u00e0 l\u2019effet que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la signature de la prochaine convention collective, seule l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 comme agent correctionnel serait reconnue. Il \u00e9tait alors entendu que cette nouvelle r\u00e8gle, parce qu\u2019adopt\u00e9e tardivement en 2006, serait toutefois appliqu\u00e9e seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 2007 et continuerait d\u2019\u00eatre en vigueur jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la convention collective pr\u00e9vue pour le 31 mai 2010.\n[19] Pour la plaignante ainsi que pour tous les autres agents correctionnels qui avaient eu une classification CR, les cons\u00e9quences furent telles que, pour la r\u00e9partition des jours de vacances, ils perdirent la reconnaissance de toutes et chacune de leurs ann\u00e9es de service reconnues par la FP avant de devenir agent de service correctionnel. De ce fait, ils reculaient de rang puisqu\u2019on ne leur reconnaissait plus que leurs ann\u00e9es comme agent correctionnel.\n[20] La plaignante d\u00e9plora \u00e9galement le fait que le contenu de l\u2019article 1-B-3 de l\u2019Entente Globale \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 \u00e0 varier d\u2019une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019autre et que, puisque les femmes sont minoritaires, leur vote avait tr\u00e8s peu de poids.\nCampagne de d\u00e9nigrement\n[21] La plaignante d\u00e9plora qu\u2019\u00e0 diff\u00e9rents moments, entre son arriv\u00e9e comme agente correctionnelle en 1999 et le vote d\u2019acceptation du projet de convention collective au printemps 2002, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019approche des assembl\u00e9es des membres o\u00f9 il devait y avoir un vote, il y eut une campagne de d\u00e9nigrement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes devenues CX apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9tenu ant\u00e9rieurement une classification CR.\n[22] Plusieurs agents correctionnels masculins, au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, en profit\u00e8rent pour tenir des propos injurieux et irrespectueux \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard; on leur reprochait principalement d\u2019avoir droit \u00e0 la reconnaissance de leurs ann\u00e9es de services en tant que CR.\n[23] Ces agents \u00e9taient d\u2019avis qu\u2019un tel traitement de faveur accord\u00e9 aux anciennes CR \u00e9tait injuste puisqu\u2019elles avaient, au cours de leurs ann\u00e9es pass\u00e9es \u00e0 la Fonction Publique, b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 de toutes leurs fins de semaines, de tous leurs cong\u00e9s statutaires, travaill\u00e9 seulement sur le quart de jour, sans avoir eu \u00e0 travailler dans un milieu dangereux comme eux, \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent correctionnel, d\u2019avoir pass\u00e9 leur temps \u00e0 servir le caf\u00e9, etc..\nB. Admission des faits par les 3 parties [24] Tant les repr\u00e9sentants du SACC que ceux du SCC furent d\u2019accord avec les d\u00e9clarations de la plaignante concernant son historique de travail, le changement d\u2019appartenance syndicale, la signature et le contenu de la convention collective ainsi que de l\u2019Entente Globale.\n[25] Tous partag\u00e8rent le m\u00eame point de vue quant aux cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1-B-3, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il a fait perdre aux agents correctionnels, tant hommes que femmes, la reconnaissance des ann\u00e9es de service accomplies aupr\u00e8s de la Fonction Publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel, peu importe la classification alors d\u00e9tenue.\n[26] Tous reconnurent que le SCC et le SACC avaient une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement et que la plaignante ne s\u2019en \u00e9tait pr\u00e9valu, sous r\u00e9serve de la justification fournie par la plaignante elle-m\u00eame ainsi que par son repr\u00e9sentant, tel qu\u2019il le sera expos\u00e9 plus loin.\nC. D\u00e9saccord sur les faits : (i) Le SCC \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de personnel f\u00e9minin. [27] Un des t\u00e9moins du SCC, apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification des normes de s\u00e9lection en vigueur le 14 septembre 1998, est venu t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la plaignante se trompait lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au moment de son embauche, en 1999, le SCC \u00e9tait \u00e0 la recherche de femmes pour combler ses effectifs. Ledit document, encore en vigueur en 1999, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve par ce m\u00eame t\u00e9moin ne faisait en aucune fa\u00e7on r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au sexe des candidats recherch\u00e9s. Rappelons que la plaignante n\u2019a produit aucune pi\u00e8ce au soutien de son all\u00e9gu\u00e9. De plus, les statistiques mises en preuve d\u00e9montr\u00e8rent que plusieurs hommes furent embauch\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n(ii) L\u2019origine de la clause 1-B-3 : uniformiser la proc\u00e9dure de distribution des cong\u00e9s. [28] En ce qui concerne la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, le syndicat nia que ses dirigeants aient pu en \u00eatre les auteurs ou m\u00eame y avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9s d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre. Il affirma de plus ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de cette campagne et ajouta qu\u2019il existe une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement. Il pr\u00e9cisa toutefois n\u2019avoir pu en faire b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier la plaignante puisqu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d\u2019aucune plainte \u00e0 cet effet.\n[29] Un des t\u00e9moins de la partie patronale, \u00e0 l\u2019emploi du Bureau des ressources humaines, est venu faire part au Tribunal qu\u2019en aucun moment avant le vote sur l\u2019adoption du projet de convention collective et de l\u2019Entente Globale, le SCC n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu de l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle campagne de d\u00e9nigrement. Elle ajouta que le SCC a aussi \u00e9tabli une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement mais, faute de d\u00e9nonciation de la part de la plaignante, n\u2019a pu r\u00e9agir en temps opportun.\n[30] Le syndicat, sans admettre l\u2019existence de la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t d\u2019avis que la plaignante a exag\u00e9r\u00e9 en se pla\u00e7ant au centre du d\u00e9bat et en pr\u00e9tendant que cette campagne pratiqu\u00e9e au CRR \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ex-secr\u00e9taires, autrefois CR, \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de la Fonction Publique, a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la clause 1-B-3.\n[31] Selon les t\u00e9moins du syndicat impliqu\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9paration, la n\u00e9gociation et la signature du projet de convention collective et de l\u2019Entente Globale, la demande concernant l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de proc\u00e9dures pour la r\u00e9partition des cong\u00e9s provenait tout simplement de l\u2019ensemble des membres des 54 \u00e9tablissements r\u00e9partis \u00e0 travers le Canada, qui trouvaient que le syst\u00e8me patronal, en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de l\u2019Alliance, \u00e9tait arbitraire et, par cons\u00e9quent, voulaient \u00e9tablir des r\u00e8gles claires et uniformes pour l\u2019ensemble des agents correctionnels du pays.\n[32] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019absence d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure applicable \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble du pays, avant l\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur de la nouvelle convention collective et l\u2019adoption de l\u2019Entente Globale en 2006, chaque \u00e9tablissement se donnait des r\u00e8gles pouvant diff\u00e9rer \u00e0 l\u2019infini et il en r\u00e9sultait que les membres manifestaient leur m\u00e9contentement. Il y avait entre autres, comme m\u00e9thode, le tirage au sort, l\u2019octroi des vacances par ordre alphab\u00e9tique ou par ann\u00e9e de service, etc.\n[33] La preuve syndicale \u00e9toff\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moignage de quelques t\u00e9moins impliqu\u00e9s tr\u00e8s \u00e9troitement dans la consultation en vue de la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019un nouveau projet d\u2019entente avec le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et le SCC a clairement d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019article 1-B-3 de l\u2019Entente Globale fut le fruit d\u2019une consultation au niveau national et r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 un besoin exprim\u00e9 par les membres \u00e0 travers le Canada.\n[34] Il est donc apparu aux n\u00e9gociateurs et \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des membres que l\u2019article 1-B-3 s\u2019av\u00e9rait \u00eatre une des m\u00e9thodes le plus susceptible de rallier le plus grand nombre de membres; en effet, selon eux, cet article jetait les bases d\u2019une r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019octroi des cong\u00e9s en tenant compte des ann\u00e9es d\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre d\u2019agent correctionnel, tout en laissant la porte entr\u2019ouverte pour les membres des \u00e9tablissements qui pourraient pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer une autre formule. Selon les t\u00e9moins entendus, la probl\u00e9matique des femmes ex-CR n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 au c\u0153ur des discussions au cours de la consultation.\n[35] De plus, il fut pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019\u00e0 chaque ann\u00e9e, les membres de chacun des \u00e9tablissements pouvaient, \u00e0 leur choix, demander la r\u00e9ouverture de cette entente et proposer une autre formule.\n[36] Dans les faits, certains des 54 \u00e9tablissements p\u00e9nitentiaires du Canada, selon les t\u00e9moins de la partie syndicale, ont profit\u00e9 de cette ouverture pour adopter une formule diff\u00e9rente. Ainsi, \u00e0 Kingston, on aurait opt\u00e9 pour l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 de la Fonction Publique, \u00e0 Donnacona et \u00e0 Archambault (selon un des t\u00e9moins de la plaignante dans le cas d\u2019Archambault) pour une clause grand-p\u00e8re.\n(iii) Le SCC partage le point de vue du syndicat. [37] Une employ\u00e9e du bureau de la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la gestion des ressources humaines du SCC qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans la n\u00e9gociation de la Convention collective et de l\u2019Entente Globale, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, que l\u2019article 1-B-3, tel que soumis par les repr\u00e9sentants du SACC, a sembl\u00e9 raisonnable aux yeux des n\u00e9gociateurs patronaux; que de plus, ils n\u2019y avaient vu aucun impact n\u00e9gatif.\n[38] Elle a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ignorait tout de la situation de la plaignante ainsi que de celles des autres personnes du CRR pouvant d\u00e9tenir une anciennet\u00e9 CR et n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venue en aucun moment de quelque probl\u00e8me que ce soit \u00e0 ce niveau.\n(iv) Efforts concert\u00e9s des agents masculins versus les agents f\u00e9minins [39] Les t\u00e9moins de la plaignante ont fait part de plusieurs incidents, qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits sur les lieux de travail. Les auteurs de ces incidents \u00e9tant des agents CX masculins qui tenaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes devenues CX apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9tenu ant\u00e9rieurement une classification CR, des propos injurieux et irrespectueux. Ces incidents se produisirent \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises et, principalement \u00e0 l\u2019approche des assembl\u00e9es o\u00f9 les membres \u00e9taient appel\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre un vote. Ils furent suffisamment fr\u00e9quents pour qu\u2019on les qualifie de campagne de d\u00e9nigrement.\n[40] Ces m\u00eames t\u00e9moins ne rapport\u00e8rent aucune irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 au cours des r\u00e9unions des membres ni n\u2019observ\u00e8rent des faits similaires \u00e0 ceux expos\u00e9s au paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\n[41] Les t\u00e9moins de la partie syndicale, pour leur part, ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 personnellement t\u00e9moins d\u2019incidents o\u00f9 de propos disgracieux de la part d\u2019agents correctionnels masculins \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des anciennes CR devenues CX, qui se seraient produits \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur ou au cours des r\u00e9unions des membres.\n[42] Plusieurs t\u00e9moins de la partie syndicale entendus ont assist\u00e9 aux assembl\u00e9es des membres, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des \u00e9tablissements du Centre r\u00e9gional de r\u00e9ception (CRR), de Leclerc, de La Macaza, de Joliette ou de Donnacona. Tous ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lors des r\u00e9unions concernant l\u2019acceptation du projet de n\u00e9gociation, de l\u2019adoption de la convention collective et de l\u2019Entente Globale et lors des rencontres qui ont port\u00e9 sur le choix d\u2019une m\u00e9thode pour \u00e9tablir la proc\u00e9dure de distribution des cong\u00e9s, dans chacun de ces \u00e9tablissements, les assembl\u00e9es se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordre et de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9mocratique.\n[43] Selon eux, les d\u00e9bats auraient parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 virils, mais toujours respectueux et sans d\u00e9bordement. Deux camps s\u2019affrontaient. D\u2019une part, il y avait les agents correctionnels oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on reconnaisse par convention collective ou autrement l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 que les travailleurs auraient pu accumuler \u00e0 la Fonction Publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel et d\u2019autre part, ceux qui demandaient la reconnaissance de leur anciennet\u00e9 Fonction publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel.\n[44] Dans aucun cas, la question du sexe n\u2019aurait fait l\u2019objet de d\u00e9bats. Ce sujet n\u2019aurait donc pu avoir aucun effet sur le r\u00e9sultat des diff\u00e9rents votes.\n(v) Effets de 1-B-3 pour les agents avec anciennet\u00e9 autre que CX [45] La preuve syndicale a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il est faux d\u2019affirmer, comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu la plaignante, que l\u2019impact de la clause 1-B-3 s\u2019est fait ressentir n\u00e9gativement en grande majorit\u00e9 sur les femmes CR.\n[46] Contrairement aux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019effet que 1-B-3 a affect\u00e9 n\u00e9gativement surtout les ex-employ\u00e9s de bureau, majoritairement des femmes, anciennement CR, les t\u00e9moins du syndicat et de l\u2019employeur ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les agentes correctionnelles avec classification CR n\u2019\u00e9taient pas la seule cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019employ\u00e9s affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par la clause 1-B-3. D\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories d\u2019employ\u00e9s le furent \u00e9galement.\n[47] Ainsi, selon eux, l\u2019impact s\u2019est fait ressentir n\u00e9gativement sur tous les agents correctionnels tant masculins que f\u00e9minins qui avaient cumul\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 la Fonction Publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel.\n[48] Voici une liste non exhaustive de cat\u00e9gories de travailleurs principalement masculins avec une exp\u00e9rience ant\u00e9rieure de la Fonction Publique d\u00e9tenant une qualification autre que CR avant de devenir agents correctionnels:\nPompiers (surtout hommes) D\u00e9fense Nationale (surtout hommes) Anciens militaires (surtout hommes) Entretien technique (surtout hommes) Ports nationaux (surtout hommes) Hommes de m\u00e9tiers (surtout hommes) Infirmiers (1 seul cas discut\u00e9 : homme)\n[49] Voici une autre liste de travailleurs dont la cat\u00e9gorie fut mentionn\u00e9e lors de l\u2019audience mais dont les discussions ne permirent pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir lequel des deux sexes \u00e9tait majoritaire :\nCuisine Lingerie Effets personnels\n[50] Les renseignements fournis au cours de l\u2019audience ne nous permettent pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir le sexe des travailleurs qui avaient cumul\u00e9 des ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 la Fonction Publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel dans les diff\u00e9rentes institutions carc\u00e9rales du Canada.\n[51] Tous ces employ\u00e9s, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur sexe, en provenance de plusieurs secteurs du travail et qui avaient eu de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience ailleurs dans la Fonction Publique avant de devenir CX au SCC auraient perdu la reconnaissance de ces ann\u00e9es de service. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon le Syndicat, il est \u00e9vident que 1-B-3 a eu un effet n\u00e9gatif non seulement sur les femmes avec une qualification CR, mais aussi sur les hommes avec une qualification CR ainsi que sur une foule d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories de travailleurs tant masculins que f\u00e9minins.\n[52] M\u00eame plus, non seulement les effets n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plus catastrophiques pour les femmes que pour les hommes, ils furent identiques pour les agents correctionnels des deux sexes.\nD. L\u2019analyse du dossier par les parties (i) La plaignante a limit\u00e9 son \u00e9tude au CRR [53] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Madame B\u00e9langer est bas\u00e9e sur ce qu\u2019elle a personnellement v\u00e9cu au Centre R\u00e9gional de R\u00e9ception (CRR) de Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines. Elle prend en consid\u00e9ration les agentes correctionnelles de cet \u00e9tablissement ainsi que les quelques hommes qui, comme elle, ont perdu les ann\u00e9es de services accumul\u00e9es avec la Fonction Publique f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[54] Or, dans cet \u00e9tablissement, plus qu\u2019ailleurs, semble-t-il que les agents correctionnels de sexe masculin auraient fait preuve d\u2019une grande agressivit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes CR et manqu\u00e9 de respect envers elles.\n[55] La perception de la plaignante est bas\u00e9e uniquement sur son exp\u00e9rience personnelle v\u00e9cue au Centre R\u00e9gional de R\u00e9ception. S\u2019appuyant sur des chiffres provenant de l\u2019employeur, non contest\u00e9s par le syndicat, le nombre de personnes du CRR affect\u00e9es n\u00e9gativement par la clause 1-B-3 fut le suivant :\nEn 2007, 2 hommes et 6 femmes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par la clause. En 2008, 9 hommes et 11 femmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9es n\u00e9gativement.\n[56] Le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que pour \u00e9valuer les effets de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1-B-3 et \u00e9tablir le nombre de personnes n\u00e9gativement affect\u00e9es, il fallait se placer au jour o\u00f9 les membres ont vot\u00e9 pour l\u2019adoption de l\u2019Entente Globale, soit le 26 juin 2006, et qu\u2019on ne devrait pas tenir compte de la fluctuation du nombre de membres au cours des ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes. Il justifie sa prise de position en pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019au moment de ce vote, les femmes \u00e9taient majoritaires.\n[57] Tel qu\u2019il sera d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans les paragraphes qui suivent, la plaignante et le syndicat n\u2019ont pas utilis\u00e9 la m\u00eame population ni la m\u00eame date pour faire leur analyse de la situation.\n(ii) Le syndicat se base sur les 54 institutions p\u00e9nitenci\u00e8res canadiennes. [58] Le syndicat reproche \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019avoir, d\u2019une part, \u00e9valu\u00e9 les effets de la clause 1-B-3 en ne tenant compte que du Centre R\u00e9gional de R\u00e9ception de Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines et, d\u2019autre part, de r\u00e9clamer l\u2019abolition de l\u2019article 1-B-3, qui, a pourtant \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par les membres de toutes les institutions p\u00e9nitentiaires du pays et s\u2019applique \u00e0 chacun d\u2019eux.\n[59] Il lui reproche \u00e9galement de se limiter \u00e0 la seule ann\u00e9e 2006 pour \u00e9valuer les effets de cette clause alors que la convention collective est d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Selon lui, il faut plut\u00f4t en \u00e9valuer les effets sur une p\u00e9riode couvrant chacune des ann\u00e9es de la convention collective.\n[60] Il reproche \u00e0 la plaignante de brandir le spectre de la discrimination du seul fait qu\u2019il y aurait une majorit\u00e9 de femmes au CRR qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9es par l\u2019application de 1-B-3. Selon lui, une simple majorit\u00e9 ne suffit pas. Il faut tenir compte d\u2019autres facteurs, comme il le sera expos\u00e9 plus loin par l\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019une jurisprudence appropri\u00e9e.\n[61] Selon le SACC, ce serait une grave erreur que d\u2019\u00e9tudier la plainte de la plaignante en se limitant \u00e0 analyser les effets de la clause 1-B-3 dans un seul \u00e9tablissement. Il all\u00e8gue qu\u2019il faut absolument examiner la situation en tenant compte du CRR, bien s\u00fbr, mais obligatoirement en se basant sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 dans les 53 autres institutions p\u00e9nitentiaires f\u00e9d\u00e9rales du Canada. Il y en avait 54 en 2006. La clause 1-B-3 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des plus de 6 000 agents correctionnels \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de tous les \u00e9tablissements p\u00e9nitentiaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux de l\u2019ensemble du pays.\n[62] Il d\u00e9clare que dans l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9tablissements examin\u00e9s, les femmes n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 majoritairement affect\u00e9es par cette clause; \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, il all\u00e8gue que le nombre d\u2019agents affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par la clause 1-B-3 aux \u00e9tablissements de:\nLa Macaza: en 2007, 13 hommes et 5 femmes et en 2009, 17 hommes et 7 femmes)\nLeclerc: en 2006, selon la pi\u00e8ce I-3, onglet (29), 15 hommes et 5 femmes auraient pu \u00eatre affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par la clause (bien qu\u2019elle ne soit entr\u00e9e en vigueur qu\u2019en 2007); en 2007, 11 hommes et 7 femmes et en 2008, 12 hommes et 7 femmes).\n[63] Il appara\u00eet que dans ces deux \u00e9tablissements, suite \u00e0 l\u2019adoption de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX, plus d\u2019hommes que de femmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement.\n[64] M\u00eame au Centre R\u00e9gional de R\u00e9ception (CRR), o\u00f9 travaillait la plaignante en 2007, 2 hommes et 6 femmes auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par la clause. En 2008, 9 hommes et 11 femmes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement; on se rend compte que la majorit\u00e9 de 2006 s\u2019est grandement effrit\u00e9e.\n[65] Il nie que les hommes, \u00e0 travers le pays, ont vot\u00e9 majoritairement pour l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX; \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple, \u00e0 Donnacona o\u00f9 les hommes sont majoritaires \u00e0 74%, ils ont opt\u00e9 pour une clause grand-p\u00e8re.\n[66] L\u2019adoption d\u2019une clause grand-p\u00e8re signifie qu\u2019il y a reconnaissance, pour fins de vacances, des ann\u00e9es de service pass\u00e9es \u00e0 la Fonction Publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel.\n[67] Il nie que si la majorit\u00e9 des membres \u00e9tait f\u00e9minine la situation serait diff\u00e9rente, comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9tendu la plaignante. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, \u00e0 Joliette, o\u00f9 les agents correctionnels sont majoritairement f\u00e9minins, l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX fut adopt\u00e9e. En 2007, 5 hommes et 27 femmes ont vot\u00e9 pour l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX et 1 homme et 6 femmes ont vot\u00e9 contre.\n[68] Il nie que les diff\u00e9rents votes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 orient\u00e9s par le sexe; comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9, la preuve a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que dans chacun des \u00e9tablissements analys\u00e9s en cours d\u2019audience, le sexe n\u2019aurait eu aucun impact au cours des d\u00e9bats qui eurent lieu \u00e0 chacun des endroits suivants : Leclerc, La Macaza, Joliette, Donnacona et m\u00eame au Centre r\u00e9gional de r\u00e9ception (CRR).\n(iii) Le SCC a parl\u00e9 pour l\u2019ensemble des institutions p\u00e9nitentiaires du Canada [69] Une employ\u00e9e du bureau de la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la gestion des ressources humaines du SCC, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des n\u00e9gociations, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question de tenir compte des besoins ou de la situation de l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des \u00e9tablissements p\u00e9nitentiaires en particulier, mais de l\u2019ensemble.\n[70] Elle ajouta n\u2019avoir re\u00e7u en aucun temps quelque demande que ce soit ni avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e d\u2019aucune situation particuli\u00e8re concernant le CRR, qui aurait pu justifier l\u2019inclusion d\u2019une clause particuli\u00e8re \u00e0 la convention collective ou \u00e0 l\u2019Entente Globale.\n[71] Elle d\u00e9clara qu\u2019en aucun moment avant la signature de la convention collective ou de l\u2019Entente Globale, elle n\u2019a entendu parler de la situation de la plaignante et de la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement.\n[72] Les n\u00e9gociateurs patronaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincus par les n\u00e9gociateurs du SACC que leur demande \u00e0 l\u2019effet de n\u00e9gocier les conditions d\u2019attribution des cong\u00e9s n\u2019avait qu\u2019un objectif, \u00e0 savoir uniformiser les conditions \u00e0 travers le pays.\n[73] Elle pr\u00e9cisa qu\u2019habituellement, les n\u00e9gociateurs de la partie patronale faisaient une \u00e9valuation de l\u2019impact des demandes syndicales \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des co\u00fbts et de la faisabilit\u00e9. Elle avoua toutefois ne pas avoir effectu\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9tude d\u2019impact concernant la clause 1-B-3.\n[74] Dans l\u2019ensemble, la demande syndicale concernant les conditions d\u2019attribution des cong\u00e9s, leur avait sembl\u00e9 raisonnable.\n[75] En ce qui concerne la notion d\u2019anciennet\u00e9, si ch\u00e8re aux syndicats, elle tint \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que cette notion n\u2019a pas cours \u00e0 la Fonction Publique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale. D\u2019ailleurs, cette notion ne fut pas incorpor\u00e9e dans la convention collective sign\u00e9e en juin 2006 avec le Syndicat.\n[76] Ce t\u00e9moin, sans toutefois s\u2019arr\u00eater longuement sur la distinction \u00e0 apporter entre les notions d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 et d\u2019ann\u00e9es de service, pr\u00e9cisa qu\u2019\u00e0 la Fonction Publique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale, on ferait plut\u00f4t usage de la notion d\u2019ann\u00e9es de service. De plus, on y reconna\u00eetrait le principe du m\u00e9rite.\n(iv) L\u2019analyse des parties n\u2019a pas le m\u00eame poids. [77] Apr\u00e8s un tel survol des positions adopt\u00e9es par la plaignante, la partie syndicale et la partie patronale, on se rend compte que la base de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence de chacune des parties est diff\u00e9rente et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas la m\u00eame envergure.\n[78] Retenons pour le moment que l\u2019\u00e9tude de la plaignante s\u2019est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement, \u00e0 savoir le Centre R\u00e9gional de R\u00e9ception de Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines o\u00f9 travaille la plaignante et que l\u2019\u00e9tude du SACC et du SCC a port\u00e9 sur les 54 \u00e9tablissements p\u00e9nitenciers canadiens.\n[79] Retenons \u00e9galement que le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante a affirm\u00e9 que pour \u00e9valuer les effets de l\u2019application de l\u2019article 1-B-3, il faut se placer au jour o\u00f9 les membres ont vot\u00e9 pour l\u2019adoption de l\u2019Entente Globale soit au 26 juin 2006 et qu\u2019on ne devrait pas tenir compte des ann\u00e9es subs\u00e9quentes. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que du fait qu\u2019une majorit\u00e9 de femmes a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e n\u00e9gativement dans son \u00e9tablissement, il en a r\u00e9sult\u00e9 qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination sur la base du sexe.\n[80] Pour sa part, le syndicat pr\u00e9tend plut\u00f4t que, pour en \u00e9valuer les effets, il faut tenir compte des effets produits au cours de chacune des ann\u00e9es de l\u2019Entente Globale et de la convention collective. Or, l\u2019une et l\u2019autre furent sign\u00e9es le 26 juin 2006 et demeureront en vigueur jusqu\u2019au 31 mai 2010. Et, dans les faits, ce n\u2019est qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 de 2007 que les nouvelles r\u00e8gles d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 applicable aux vacances furent appliqu\u00e9es. Par cons\u00e9quent, aux yeux du syndicat, la date de 2006 retenue par la plaignante n\u2019est pas justifiable. De plus, selon lui, il ne suffit pas de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019une majorit\u00e9 de femmes a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e n\u00e9gativement, il faut d\u00e9montrer que les effets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plus pr\u00e9judiciables aux femmes qu\u2019aux hommes, ce que la preuve de la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de faire dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier.\nIII. Crit\u00e8res juridiques applicables : A. L\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une cause prima facie [81] L\u2019article 7 (b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019employeur qui, en cours d\u2019emploi, d\u00e9favorise un employ\u00e9 en se fondant sur un des motifs de distinction \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2018article 3, pose un acte discriminatoire illicite; dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 comme acte discriminatoire.\n[82] L\u2019article 10 (b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019employeur et\/ou l\u2019organisation syndicale qui conclut des ententes susceptibles d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019individus, en se fondant sur un des motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2018article 3 pose un acte discriminatoire; dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9 comme acte discriminatoire.\n[83] Dans tout dossier concernant les droits de la personne port\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019attention du Tribunal, le plaignant a, dans un premier temps, l\u2019obligation de soumettre au Tribunal des faits d\u00e9montrant l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Il ne peut se limiter \u00e0 donner une opinion ou une impression de discrimination.\n[84] Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, comme la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 discrimination bas\u00e9e sur le sexe, elle doit fournir au Tribunal une preuve testimoniale et\/ou documentaire supportant les all\u00e9gations faites dans sa plainte, compl\u00e8te et suffisante, comme l\u2019enseigne la Cour Supr\u00eame dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28:\nDans les instances devant un tribunal des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit faire une preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire qu'il y a discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9.\n[85] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, le Tribunal doit se limiter \u00e0 l\u2019analyse de la seule preuve tant testimoniale que documentaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante. Il doit faire abstraction de la preuve soumise par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9ponse. Voir \u00e0 cet effet Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204 au par. 22:\n[22] L'approche adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal et confirm\u00e9e par le juge du proc\u00e8s afin de d\u00e9cider si le demandeur avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination n'est pas appuy\u00e9e par la jurisprudence. La preuve prima facie produite par l'appelant \u00e9tablissait qu'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste de chef m\u00e9canicien sur le N.M. Princess of Acadia, qu'il poss\u00e9dait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour ce poste, qu'une autre personne avait obtenu le poste et que sa race avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e d'embaucher les autres candidats. Dans ces all\u00e9gations, l'appelant aurait pu \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, savoir une preuve : qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9. Au lieu de d\u00e9cider si ces all\u00e9gations, si elles \u00e9taient crues, justifiaient un verdict favorable \u00e0 l'appelant, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement tenu compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e avant de conclure qu'une preuve prima facie n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Comme il d\u00e9coule clairement de l'arr\u00eat Etobicoke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 et de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, ce dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne joue aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[86] De plus, les all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de la plaignante doivent \u00eatre cr\u00e9dibles, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 supporter la conclusion \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019une preuve prima facie existe (Dhanjal c. CCDP (1997) CanLII 5751 (C.F.) au para. 6).\n[87] Enfin, si le Tribunal juge qu\u2019il y a absence d\u2019une preuve prima facie par rapport \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel des all\u00e9gations ou que la preuve soumise est incompl\u00e8te ou insuffisante, il devra rejeter la plainte. Voir C.C.D.P. c. C.N., (2000) 38 C.H.R.R.D\/107 (C.F.). Dans les faits, c\u2019est vraiment une question de savoir si chaque aspect essentiel de l\u2019acte discriminatoire est appuy\u00e9 par un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\nB. Les moyens de d\u00e9fense [88] Par contre, s\u2019il est d\u2019avis qu\u2019une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, les cons\u00e9quences seront que le fardeau de la preuve se d\u00e9placera. Il incombera alors aux intim\u00e9s de d\u00e9montrer que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par la plaignante est sans fondement parce que non existante ou que la conduite reproch\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire ou \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e. Dans ce dernier cas, les intim\u00e9s pourront fournir des explications raisonnables ou satisfaisantes quant \u00e0 la pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire. (Voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd, 2004 CAF 204 (CANLII), 2004 CAF 204, paragraphe 23; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (CANLII), paragraphes 26 et 27).\n[89] Toutefois, la conduite d\u2019un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire s\u2019il peut d\u00e9montrer que ses refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (alin\u00e9a 15(1)a) de la Loi). Pour qu\u2019une pratique soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une EPJ, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts et\/ou de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi).\n[90] L\u2019intim\u00e9e doit \u00e9galement prouver que la justification n\u2019est pas un simple pr\u00e9texte pour masquer une pratique discriminatoire. Ainsi en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (P.G.) c. Lambie, (1996) 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483.\nC. La preuve [91] Le degr\u00e9 de preuve exig\u00e9 pour juger de l\u2019existence ou de la non-existence de la discrimination est celui qu\u2019on exige dans les dossiers de nature civile, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de preuve. Les exigences d\u2019une telle preuve sont moins grandes que celles exig\u00e9es devant un tribunal qui si\u00e8ge en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Voici ce que le Tribunal avait \u00e0 dire sur ce sujet dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dawson c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2008 TCDP 41 au paragraphe 73 :\n[73] Cela dit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Wall c. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, [1997] C.C.D.P. no 6, la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination reste la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et, s'agissant de la preuve circonstancielle, le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carwell, 1987, page 142).\n[92] La jurisprudence a reconnu depuis longtemps la difficult\u00e9 que rencontre tout plaignant qui cherche \u00e0 faire la preuve de ses all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de discrimination.\n[93] Dans le cas sous \u00e9tude, la plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi sur la base de son sexe et\/ou que l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 1-B-3 de l\u2019Entente Globale est susceptible d\u2019annihiler ses chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement.\nIV. L\u2019Analyse A. La campagne de d\u00e9nigrement a-t-elle d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 Madame B\u00e9langer en cours d\u2019emploi? Art. 7 de la Loi. (i) La plaignante n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir une cause prima facie\nCampagne de d\u00e9nigrement\n[94] La plaignante all\u00e9gua que la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement de plusieurs agents correctionnels CX masculins du CRR dirig\u00e9e contre les agentes correctionnelles avec exp\u00e9rience CR reconnue par la Fonction publique l\u2019avait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi; selon elle, cette campagne aurait atteint son paroxysme surtout au d\u00e9but de la campagne de maraudage de 2001.\n[95] Malgr\u00e9 la proximit\u00e9 temporelle des campagnes de d\u00e9nigrement et de maraudage, la preuve entendue n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu un lien entre l\u2019une et l\u2019autre.\n[96] La plaignante ainsi que ses t\u00e9moins ont fait la preuve qu\u2019il y a v\u00e9ritablement eu une campagne de d\u00e9nigrement et qu\u2019en cons\u00e9quence, elle en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 humili\u00e9e.\n[97] La plaignante all\u00e9gua que cette campagne de d\u00e9nigrement a eu pour effet de la d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi. Elle n\u2019a toutefois fourni aucune explication ni donn\u00e9 aucun exemple pouvant expliquer comment cette campagne avait pu l\u2019affecter.\n[98] La preuve soumise nous a permis de juger que cette campagne de d\u00e9nigrement fut le fait d\u2019initiatives personnelles orchestr\u00e9es par des agents correctionnels CX masculins, frustr\u00e9s par la situation.\n[99] Cette preuve n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le SACC ou le SCC \u00e9tait derri\u00e8re cette campagne de d\u00e9nigrement ou la moussait ou simplement aurait ferm\u00e9 les yeux.\n[100] Pour leur part, les repr\u00e9sentants du SACC et du SCC ont affirm\u00e9 que cette campagne de d\u00e9nigrement a pu avoir lieu mais que si tel fut le cas, ce fut \u00e0 leur insu. Ils ni\u00e8rent que leurs repr\u00e9sentants ou agents aient pu y avoir quelqu\u2019implication que ce soit. De ce fait, ils se sont soustraits \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 65 de la Loi.\n[101] La plainte pour discrimination que la plaignante fit parvenir \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne fut dirig\u00e9e contre le SACC et le SCC. Il en r\u00e9sulte que le SACC et le SCC sont les seuls intim\u00e9s.\n[102] Quant aux individus consid\u00e9r\u00e9s responsables de cette campagne, ils n\u2019ont tout simplement pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9s comme intim\u00e9s.\n[103] Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame si la plaignante all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi par la campagne de harc\u00e8lement, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d\u2019en faire la preuve. Elle ne peut non plus en bl\u00e2mer le SACC et\/ou le SCC, car aucun de ses employ\u00e9s, mandataires, administrateurs ou dirigeants, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, dans le cadre de son emploi, n\u2019en est l\u2019auteur ni n\u2019y a consenti. Sans compter que chacun d\u2019eux, en adoptant une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement, a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 tout son personnel un message clair \u00e0 l\u2019effet que le harc\u00e8lement ne serait pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce furent l\u00e0 les mesures prises par l\u2019un et l\u2019autre pour emp\u00eacher de tels incidents de se produire \u00e0 nouveau. Ils ne peuvent donc \u00eatre tenus responsables de discrimination sur la base du sexe.\nHarc\u00e8lement\n[104] Les faits invoqu\u00e9s par la demanderesse pour all\u00e9guer l\u2019existence d\u2019une campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, qui l\u2019aurait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi, sont les m\u00eames que ceux sur lesquels elle s\u2019appuie pour all\u00e9guer harc\u00e8lement.\n[105] Or, bien qu\u2019elle connaissait l\u2019existence des politiques de harc\u00e8lement du SCC et du SACC, la plaignante jugea inutile de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir et de d\u00e9poser, \u00e0 l\u2019occasion ou \u00e0 la suite de la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, une plainte de harc\u00e8lement aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019un et de l\u2019autre. Elle indiqua qu\u2019elle ne croyait pas en leur efficacit\u00e9. Pour sa part, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante reconnut que les propos reproch\u00e9s au cours de cette campagne n\u2019\u00e9taient pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9s par le SCC, mais justifia l\u2019absence de plainte au motif qu\u2019aucune femme en particulier n\u2019en aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 la cible et qu\u2019ils escomptaient que la campagne de harc\u00e8lement cesserait.\n[106] Par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e0 d\u00e9faut de recevoir une plainte en bonne et due forme, tant le SACC que le SCC ne purent donner un appui quelconque \u00e0 la plaignante et ne peuvent ainsi \u00eatre accus\u00e9s de n\u00e9gligence ou de quelque manquement que ce soit. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une plainte, ils n\u2019eurent pas l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de tenter d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019article 65 de la Loi.\nImpact sur le processus d\u00e9cisionnel\n[107] Malgr\u00e9 l\u2019existence de la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, la plaignante n\u2019a pu faire la preuve qu\u2019au cours:\ndes r\u00e9unions exploratoires et\/ou d\u2019information sur la n\u00e9gociation, de la r\u00e9union de ratification de la convention collective ainsi que de l\u2019Entente globale, celle au cours de laquelle l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX fut adopt\u00e9e,\nce fut un vote des hommes dirig\u00e9 contre les femmes.\n[108] Elle n\u2019a pu d\u00e9montrer que lors de ces rencontres le processus d\u00e9mocratique ne fut respect\u00e9 ni fut orient\u00e9 contre les agentes correctionnelles anciennement CR ni que le sexe aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 au c\u0153ur des d\u00e9bats.\n[109] Bien qu\u2019il soit vraisemblable d\u2019imaginer que la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 les diff\u00e9rents votes des membres ait pu avoir prima facie un effet sur le processus d\u00e9mocratique, la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant nous ne nous permet pas d\u2019en \u00e9valuer les effets sur l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 1-B-3 et sur la d\u00e9cision prise par les membres du CRR d\u2019adopter l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX comme mode de partage des vacances. Il nous appara\u00eet que le d\u00e9roulement d\u00e9mocratique des assembl\u00e9es, qui eurent lieu de fa\u00e7on respectueuse, a pu annuler ou att\u00e9nuer consid\u00e9rablement les effets n\u00e9gatifs de la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement.\n[110] La preuve entendue ne nous permet de conclure que dans les 53 autres \u00e9tablissements correctionnels du pays, il y a eu campagne de d\u00e9nigrement comme au CRR, que le facteur sexe a eu un effet quelconque sur l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 1-B-3 et qu\u2019il y a eu un vote des hommes dirig\u00e9 contre les femmes.\n(ii) La plaignante a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e par rapport \u00e0 un autre groupe? [111] La plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019article 1-B-3 a eu un effet d\u00e9favorable surtout sur les femmes du CRR o\u00f9 elle travaillait. Dans les faits, comme on l\u2019a vu plus haut, cette affirmation s\u2019av\u00e8re plus ou moins exacte. Pour s\u2019en rendre compte, il suffit d\u2019examiner les statistiques fournies par la plaignante elle-m\u00eame (Pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 9), d\u2019ailleurs, admises par le SCC et le SACC.\n[112] En effet, on y voit que le nombre d\u2019hommes et de femmes affect\u00e9s n\u00e9gativement par l\u2019application de 1-B-3, au CRR, d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e de l\u2019application de la nouvelle m\u00e9thode de partage des vacances, en 2007, \u00e9tait presque le m\u00eame en 2008. En effet, pour \u00e9valuer les effets de l\u2019article 1-B-3, il faut tenir compte non seulement des femmes qui d\u00e9tenaient une qualification CR, mais aussi des autres hommes et femmes du CRR qui d\u00e9tenaient une classification autre avant d\u2019\u00eatre reconnus CX. \u00c0 la pi\u00e8ce P-1, onglet 9, on d\u00e9nombre 10 anciens avec qualification CR (9 femmes et 1 homme) et 9 avec un autre type de qualification (8 hommes et 1 femme).\n[113] De plus, le fait qu\u2019il y ait eu un peu plus de femmes que d\u2019hommes au CRR qui furent affect\u00e9s par 1-B-3, n\u2019est pas suffisant pour all\u00e9guer discrimination sur la base du sexe. \u00c0 l\u2019appui de cette affirmation, nous jugeons appropri\u00e9 de reproduire quelques extraits pertinents de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour F\u00e9d\u00e9rale d\u2019appel : Thibaudeau c. Sa Majest\u00e9 la Reine (1994) 2 D.F. 189:\nPage 9 \u2026\nDe fait, \u00e0 mon avis, ce n\u2019est pas parce que plus de femmes que d\u2019hommes subissent des effets pr\u00e9judiciables, mais parce que certaines femmes, si petit que soit leur groupe, subissent des effets plus pr\u00e9judiciables que le groupe d\u2019hommes \u00e9quivalent, qu\u2019on peut dire d\u2019une disposition qu\u2019elle cr\u00e9e une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n\u2026\nAussi me semble-t-il que l\u2019on ne puisse logiquement pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019une r\u00e8gle par ailleurs neutre cr\u00e9e une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe pour la simple raison que ses effets se font sentir sur un plus grand nombre de personnes d\u2019un sexe que de l\u2019autre \u2026 L\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment cl\u00e9 n\u2019est \u00e9videmment pas le nombre, mais la nature des effets; c\u2019est la qualit\u00e9 et non la quantit\u00e9 qui importe. (Soulign\u00e9 du Tribunal) Si la loi qui entra\u00eene des effets pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes a les m\u00eames effets pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des hommes, bien que ces derniers soient moins nombreux ou qu\u2019ils soient moins susceptibles d\u2019en souffrir, on ne peut soutenir logiquement que la discrimination est fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\nN.B. Cet arr\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 infirm\u00e9 par la CSC dans Thibaudeau c. Canada (1995) 2 RCS 627. Cet arr\u00eat aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 mais pour d\u2019autres motifs que ceux all\u00e9gu\u00e9s ci-haut.\n[114] La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suffisante pour d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie d\u2019actes discriminatoires au sens de l\u2019article 7 (b) de la Loi.\n[115] D\u2019une part, le nombre de femmes affect\u00e9es par les effets n\u00e9gatifs de 1-B-3 fut semblable \u00e0 celui des hommes. D\u2019autre part, les effets d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019application de la clause 1-B-3 furent identiques pour les agents des deux sexes.\n[116] La plaignante n\u2019a donc pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les effets furent plus pr\u00e9judiciables pour les femmes du CRR que pour les autres employ\u00e9s masculins du CRR qui d\u00e9tenaient une classification autre avant d\u2019\u00eatre CX. Tous et chacun ayant en effet perdu la reconnaissance de leurs ann\u00e9es de service pass\u00e9es \u00e0 la Fonction publique avant de devenir agent correctionnel.\n[117] La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant nous a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet qu\u2019il en \u00e9tait ainsi dans tous les \u00e9tablissements \u00e0 travers le pays.\n[118] Par cons\u00e9quent, la plaignante n\u2019a pas pu d\u00e9montrer par preuve prima facie qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi par rapport aux hommes qui se trouvaient dans une situation similaire \u00e0 la sienne.\nD\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi\n[119] Tel que mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, la preuve soumise n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 la plaignante en cours d\u2019emploi.\n[120] Nous avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9 que en \u00e9tions arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que (1) la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019aucun employ\u00e9, mandataire, administrateur ou dirigeant du SACC ou du SCC n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable, dans le cadre de son emploi, \u00e0 quelque degr\u00e9 que ce soit de la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement qu\u2019a d\u00fb subir la plaignante, (2) que l\u2019un et l\u2019autre ayant adopt\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles de conduite anti-harc\u00e8lement, ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher ce genre d\u2019abus et que, finalement, (3) la plaignante n\u2019ayant d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune plainte pour d\u00e9noncer ladite campagne, tant le SACC que le SCC n\u2019ont pu tenter d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets.\n[121] Il en d\u00e9coule que la plaignante n\u2019a pu d\u00e9montrer par preuve prima facie que les deux intim\u00e9s l\u2019ont d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination sur la base du sexe de la part des deux intim\u00e9s.\nB. L\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 1-B-3 a-t-il \u00e9t\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement de Madame B\u00e9langer, au sens de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi?\n(i) La plaignante n\u2019a pu \u00e9tablir une cause prima facie [122] Comme l\u2019expression chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement est un \u00e9l\u00e9ment important de l\u2019article 10 (b) de la Loi, nous jugeons appropri\u00e9 d\u2019utiliser le sens que lui en a donn\u00e9 l\u2019arr\u00eat suivant dont nous reproduisons un extrait que nous jugeons appropri\u00e9. Voici \u00e0 cet effet les paragraphes 97 et 98 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Walden et autres c. D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 13 d\u00e9cembre 2007, TCDP :\n[97] La version fran\u00e7aise de l'article 10 porte sur les lignes de conduite qui sont susceptibles d'annihiler les chances d'emploi ou d'avancement d'un individu ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie d'individus. Lorsque les versions fran\u00e7aise et anglaise de l'article 10 sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es ensemble, on en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'expression chances d'emploi ou d'avancement vise les conditions qui permettent l'emploi ou l'avancement d'une personne dans son domaine.\n[98] La jurisprudence du Tribunal refl\u00e8te cette interpr\u00e9tation. Le Tribunal a utilis\u00e9 l'expression chances d'emploi ou d'avancement pour parler de possibilit\u00e9s de transfert \u00e0 un autre poste (Gauthier c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, [1989] T.C.D.P. no 3 T.D. 3\/89); de possibilit\u00e9s de faire certains types de travail qui am\u00e9liorerait la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et les possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement de carri\u00e8re (O'Connell c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, [1988] T.C.D.P. no T.D. 9\/88); des possibilit\u00e9s de formation (Green c. Canada (Commission de la fonction publique), [1998] T.C.D.P. no T.D. 6\/98, contr\u00f4le judiciaire pour d'autres motifs : Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Green, [2000] 4 C.F. 629 (1re inst.)); et des possibilit\u00e9s d'emploi continu et ininterrompu (Hay c. Cameco, [1991] T.C.D.P. no 5 no T.D. 5\/91).\nN.B. Cette d\u00e9cision du TCDP dans Walden a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la CF, citation neutre 2010 FC 490. Un appel \u00e0 la CAF a \u00e9t\u00e9 interjet\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la d\u00e9cision de la CF : num. de dossier : A-219-10.\n[123] La plaignante a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019application de 1-B-3 n\u2019a eu qu\u2019un seul effet n\u00e9gatif, \u00e0 savoir celui de lui faire perdre la reconnaissance de son anciennet\u00e9 de la fonction publique aux fins de partage des jours de vacances. Elle n\u2019a pu d\u00e9montrer avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en aucune autre fa\u00e7on. Elle n\u2019a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 aucun effet n\u00e9gatif que 1-B-3 aurait pu avoir sur ses chances de promotions, sur l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 d\u2019une mise-\u00e0-pied, de transfert ou sur quelqu\u2019autre condition de travail que ce soit. Elle ne nous a pas convaincu que 1-B-3 constituait un acte discriminatoire bas\u00e9 sur son sexe.\n[124] Par cons\u00e9quent, sa preuve n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli une cause prima facie de discrimination sur la base de l\u2019article 10 (b) de la Loi en \u00e9tant incapable de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019adoption de 1-B-3 a \u00e9t\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019annihiler ses chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit.\n[125] Si nous en \u00e9tions arriv\u00e9s \u00e0 la conclusion que la plaignante a perdu une chance d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement, ce que la preuve n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9, il nous faudrait v\u00e9rifier si les intim\u00e9s se sont soustrait \u00e0 l\u2019exigence de pr\u00e9somption qui pesait contre eux en vertu de l\u2019article 65 de la Loi. Voici le texte de cet article :\n65 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019Association qui l\u2019emploie.\n(2) La personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s\u2019il \u00e9tablit que l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu\u2019il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets.\n[126] Le 1er paragraphe de l\u2019article 65 aurait pour effet que les intim\u00e9s SCC et SACC, en tant qu\u2019employeur des personnes qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, seraient pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s \u00eatre responsables des gestes de leurs membres ou employ\u00e9s.\n[127] Toutefois, en vertu du 2e paragraphe de cet article, ils peuvent se soustraire \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9somption en d\u00e9montrant avoir pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, ils ont tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets. La preuve entendue a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019effet que la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, que la plaignante a qualifi\u00e9e de harc\u00e8lement, a eu lieu \u00e0 l\u2019insu des intim\u00e9s; ceux-ci avaient pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir le harc\u00e8lement en ayant adopt\u00e9 des lignes de conduite anti-harc\u00e8lement, qui \u00e9taient connues de la plaignante. Toutefois, celle-ci, pour des raisons d\u00e9j\u00e0 expliqu\u00e9es, a pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 ne pas s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir. Pour ces motifs, les intim\u00e9s n\u2019ont pu tenter d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets et ainsi ont pu se soustraire \u00e0 la pr\u00e9somption de l\u2019article 65.\nDroits acquis ou individuels\n[128] Puisque la plaignante all\u00e9gua que, suite \u00e0 l\u2019application de 1-B-3, la cessation de la reconnaissance de ses ann\u00e9es de service autrefois reconnues par la Fonction Publique aux fins de partage des vacances, \u00e9tait une violation de ses droits acquis, nous jugeons important de clarifier les points suivants : (1) Sommes-nous vraiment en pr\u00e9sence de droits acquis? Et (2), qu\u2019en est-il du respect des droits acquis en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne?\n[129] Rappelons tout d\u2019abord qu\u2019avant l\u2019adoption de 1-B-3, toutes ses ann\u00e9es de service \u00e9taient reconnues par la Fonction Publique aux fins de partage des vacances. \u00c0 noter toutefois que cette reconnaissance n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 la convention collective sign\u00e9e entre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor et le syndicat de la Fonction publique, qui repr\u00e9sentait alors le personnel administratif du SCC, avant d\u2019\u00eatre remplac\u00e9 par le SACC affili\u00e9 \u00e0 la CSN. Tout au plus s\u2019agissait-il de droits individuels acquis au fil des ans et non de droits collectifs.\n[130] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet par ailleurs le droit de modifier les droits acquis des parties, notamment leur anciennet\u00e9. Voir \u00e0 cet effet : H\u00e9mond c. Coop\u00e9rative f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9e du Qu\u00e9bec, (1989) 2 R.C.S. 962 :\nBien qu'il soit possible dans certains cas d'interpr\u00e9ter une convention collective de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre des droits d'anciennet\u00e9 \u00e0 certains travailleurs, il n'est pas permis d'ignorer carr\u00e9ment les termes d'une telle convention pour conf\u00e9rer \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s des droits acquis en la mati\u00e8re. Les droits d'anciennet\u00e9, au m\u00eame titre que n'importe quel autre droit des employ\u00e9s, sont assujettis au processus de la n\u00e9gociation collective. Dans le contexte des relations ouvri\u00e8res, il serait, pour dire le moins, in\u00e9dit d'\u00e9lever ces droits, absolument et irr\u00e9m\u00e9diablement, au rang de droits acquis. Quand il existe une convention collective, les droits individuels sont \u00e0 toutes fins pratiques \u00e9cart\u00e9s. Comme l'affirme le juge en chef Laskin, \u00e0 la p. 725 de l'affaire McGavin Toastmaster Ltd. c. Ainscough, [1976] 1 R.C.S. 718, o\u00f9 on reprend un principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l'affaire Syndicat catholique des employ\u00e9s de magasins de Qu\u00e9bec Inc. v. Compagnie Paquet Lt\u00e9e, [1959] R.C.S. 206:\nLe droit commun applicable aux contrats individuels de travail ne vaut plus quand les relations employeur-employ\u00e9 sont r\u00e9gies par une convention collective qui traite, comme celle pr\u00e9sentement en cause, de licenciement, de cessation d'emploi, d'indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi et d'une foule d'autres choses qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9es entre le syndicat et la compagnie en tant que parties principales \u00e0 la convention.\n[131] Le droit commun applicable aux contrats individuels et collectifs continue d\u2019\u00eatre en vigueur m\u00eame dans les dossiers de droits de la personne, sous r\u00e9serve que, tel que pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Etobicoke pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, les parties ne peuvent pas, par contrat, renoncer aux dispositions des lois portant sur les droits de la personne.\n[132] Suite \u00e0 cette analyse, nous en concluons que premi\u00e8rement, la plaignante ne peut pr\u00e9tendre avoir perdu des droits acquis en mati\u00e8re de partage des vacances puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019en poss\u00e9dait pas avant l\u2019adoption de 1-B-3 et que, deuxi\u00e8mement, de toute mani\u00e8re, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de les modifier par une clause de la convention collective. Rappelons ici que les dispositions de l\u2019Entente Globale avaient pour objet de clarifier certaines dispositions de la convention collective des agents correctionnels CX. Troisi\u00e8mement, ni le SACC ni le SCC n\u2019aurait enfreint quelqu\u2019article que ce soit de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\n[133] La plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de droits acquis en mati\u00e8re d\u2019anciennet\u00e9. Elle n\u2019a pu donner un seul exemple d\u00e9montrant qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit en cours d\u2019emploi, au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, ni que ses chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement, au sens de l\u2019article 10, \u00e9taient susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre annihil\u00e9es. Il en r\u00e9sulte son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 prouver que le SACC et\/ou le SCC, dans le cadre de la campagne de harc\u00e8lement ou de l\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 1-B-3, a pos\u00e9 un geste discriminatoire sur la base du sexe de la plaignante qui l\u2019aurait d\u00e9favoris\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi ou qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019annihiler ses chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement.\n(ii) La justification fournie par le SACC et le SCC n\u2019est-elle qu\u2019un pr\u00e9texte? [134] M\u00eame si la plaignante avait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019existence d\u2019une preuve prima facie, nous serions d\u2019avis que la justification fournie par le SACC, appuy\u00e9e par le SCC, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un pr\u00e9texte. Les raisons avanc\u00e9es par les t\u00e9moins du SACC et du SCC nous ont sembl\u00e9 des raisons tout \u00e0 fait valables et raisonnables.\n[135] Il nous est apparu que tant la partie syndicale que patronale auraient agi en toute bonne foi. Nous tenons \u00e0 le mentionner m\u00eame si nous sommes conscients que la bonne foi n\u2019est pas d\u00e9terminante pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la nature raisonnable de l\u2019explication.\n[136] Le fait que chaque \u00e9tablissement a la possibilit\u00e9, en vertu de l\u2019article 1-B-3, d\u2019adopter une formule autre que l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 CX ne nous semble pas contradictoire avec la volont\u00e9 exprim\u00e9e par les dirigeants syndicaux d\u2019uniformiser le processus de distribution des cong\u00e9s. Tout au plus s\u2019agit-il pour les membres d\u2019un droit qui peut leur permettre, \u00e0 chaque ann\u00e9e, d\u2019adopter, au cours d\u2019une assembl\u00e9e des membres, une formule diff\u00e9rente qui r\u00e9pondrait mieux aux besoins de chacun des \u00e9tablissements \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9.\n[137] En accordant ce droit aux membres de chacun des \u00e9tablissements, on y voit l\u00e0 une volont\u00e9 d\u2019uniformiser le processus de distribution des cong\u00e9s, En ce sens, les r\u00e8gles \u00e0 appliquer sont uniformes partout au Canada. Nous sommes d\u2019avis que l\u2019uniformisation de ce processus \u00e9tait une justification valable et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un pr\u00e9texte.\nV. La d\u00e9cision [138] La campagne de d\u00e9nigrement bas\u00e9e sur le sexe, dont la plaignante a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, ne peut \u00eatre imput\u00e9e aux deux parties intim\u00e9es, \u00e0 savoir le Service correctionnel du Canada (le SCC) et le Syndicat des agents correctionnels du Canada (le SACC) pour les motifs suivants. La preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que leurs employ\u00e9s, mandataires, administrateurs ou dirigeants des deux intim\u00e9s, dans le cadre de leur emploi, n\u2019en \u00e9taient ni les auteurs ni les supporteurs, que les gestes pos\u00e9s l\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 sans leur consentement, qu\u2019ils avaient pris tous les moyens n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir de tels abus, notamment en adoptant une politique anti-harc\u00e8lement. Et, finalement, qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pu att\u00e9nuer ou annuler les effets de cette campagne tout simplement parce que la plaignante ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9value de son droit de d\u00e9poser une plainte.\n[139] De plus, la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la campagne de d\u00e9nigrement, acte discriminatoire reproch\u00e9 au SACC et au SCC, a eu pour effet de la d\u00e9favoriser en cours d\u2019emploi au sens de l\u2019article 7 (b) de la Loi ou m\u00eame a \u00e9t\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019annihiler ses chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement au sens de l\u2019article 10 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019un et l\u2019autre intim\u00e9 ne peuvent en \u00eatre tenus responsables.\n[140] L\u2019adoption de l\u2019article 1-B-3 de l\u2019Entente Globale par le SACC et le SCC n\u2019a aucunement constitu\u00e9 un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur le sexe; ce motif n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de d\u00e9favoriser la plaignante en cours d\u2019emploi au sens de l\u2019article 7 (b) de la Loi ni \u00e9t\u00e9 susceptible d\u2019annihiler ses chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement au sens de l\u2019article 10 (b) de la Loi. M\u00eame plus, la preuve soumise fut \u00e0 l\u2019effet que l\u2019adoption de 1-B-3 nous est apparue comme \u00e9tant justifi\u00e9e et raisonnable.\n[141] Les parties intim\u00e9es se sont soustraites \u00e0 l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9somption pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 65 de la Loi, tel que plus amplement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ailleurs dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[142] Pour tous ces motifs, la plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nR\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer Membre du tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario) Le 16 novembre 2010\nTRIBUNAL canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1419\/4509 et T1420\/4609\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Guylaine B\u00e9langer c.

Lustig Date : Le 24 novembre 2010 R\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2010 TCDP 31\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision concernant la requ\u00eate de la plaignante en modification de sa plainte pour y ajouter des motifs additionnels de discrimination illicites et une pratique discriminatoire suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[2] En ao\u00fbt 2004, la plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste d\u2019agente des services \u00e0 la client\u00e8le au bureau des services fiscaux de Vancouver de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (l\u2019ARC ou l\u2019intim\u00e9e). Dans sa demande, la plaignante a fourni son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, son adresse courriel et son adresse r\u00e9sidentielle \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[3] Le 28 juin 2005, la plaignante a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e dans un large bassin de candidats qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s qualifi\u00e9s pour le poste.\n[4] Par la suite, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a tent\u00e9 de communiquer avec la plaignante par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, en utilisant les coordonn\u00e9es qu\u2019elle avait fournies, pour lui offrir le poste. Cependant, la plaignante avait alors un nouveau num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et une nouvelle adresse courriel, mais r\u00e9sidait toujours \u00e0 la m\u00eame adresse. Il \u00e9tait impossible de la joindre en utilisant le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone qu\u2019elle avait inscrit dans sa demande.\n[5] Le bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s a expir\u00e9 le 27 juin 2007.\n[6] En septembre 2007, la plaignante a \u00e9crit une lettre \u00e0 Rod Quiney, sous\u2011commissaire r\u00e9gional (r\u00e9gion du Pacifique) pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lui demandant de l\u2019embaucher directement pour un poste semblable \u00e0 Victoria. Dans sa lettre, la plaignante s\u2019est plainte du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait d\u00fb utiliser son nouveau num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et sa nouvelle adresse courriel, mais elle n\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 aucune autre plainte.\n[7] En octobre 2007, M. Quiney a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre de la plaignante, refusant de l\u2019embaucher. Il a donn\u00e9 plusieurs raisons pour justifier son refus, y compris le fait que le poste pour lequel elle s\u2019\u00e9tait qualifi\u00e9e \u00e9tait pour le bureau de Vancouver et que le bassin dans lequel elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 plac\u00e9e \u00e9tait expir\u00e9.\n[8] Le 10 juin 2008, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, all\u00e9guant avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle soutient dans sa plainte que l\u2019acte discriminatoire a eu lieu \u00e0 Vancouver, de septembre 2005 au 29 octobre 2007.\n[9] La plaignante soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 de l\u2019embaucher en raison de sa relation avec son beau\u2011fr\u00e8re Chris Hughes, qui la repr\u00e9sente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et en repr\u00e9sailles pour une autre plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e auparavant. La plaignante soutient que plusieurs gestionnaires de l\u2019intim\u00e9e connaissent Chris Hughes, y compris Rod Quiney, parce que M. Hughes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aux affaires internes (qui impliquait en partie la plaignante), a intent\u00e9 des poursuites au civil, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, a demand\u00e9 des contr\u00f4les judiciaires en Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des griefs et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes au Conseil des relations de travail contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [Traduction] un divulgateur reconnu et l\u2019ennemi no 1 de l\u2019ARC.\n[10] Le 12 d\u00e9cembre 2009, la plaignante a envoy\u00e9 un deuxi\u00e8me formulaire de plainte \u00e0 la Commission (la plainte modifi\u00e9e). La plainte modifi\u00e9e \u00e9tait identique au formulaire de plainte original, sauf l\u2019ajout de deux paragraphes \u00e0 la fin, dans lesquels la plaignante (1) all\u00e9guait que l\u2019enqu\u00eate avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 une discrimination non\u2011intentionnelle dans la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e garde, met \u00e0 jour et utilise les coordonn\u00e9es et (2) d\u00e9clarait que la plaignante s\u2019\u00e9tait [Traduction] auto-identifi\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant une minorit\u00e9 visible, avait fourni un passeport qui montrait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9e au Vietnam, qu\u2019elle est d\u2019origine chinoise et que sa couleur de peau est jaune comme une asiatique. Dans la plainte modifi\u00e9e, la plaignante demandait \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019enqu\u00eater dans ce dossier [Traduction] en tenant compte des motifs de distinction illicites additionnels suivants : l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la race et la couleur, et en tenant compte de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a), en plus des repr\u00e9sailles et du motif de distinction illicite de la situation de famille.\n[11] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la plainte modifi\u00e9e, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission, Dean Steacy, aurait dit au repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante (Chris Hughes) que la plainte modifi\u00e9e serait [Traduction] hors d\u00e9lai et causerait [Traduction] un long d\u00e9lai dans le dossier.\n[12] Le 25 f\u00e9vrier 2010, M. Hughes, au nom de la plaignante, a retir\u00e9 la plainte modifi\u00e9e.\n[13] Le 16 juillet 2010, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte d\u2019origine au Tribunal pour instruction, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP). La plainte modifi\u00e9e ne faisait pas partie du renvoi.\n[14] Dans son avis de requ\u00eate, la plaignante d\u00e9clare :\n[Traduction]\nMaintenant que le dossier est devant le Tribunal, nous demandons que le Tribunal accueille la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pour ajouter les motifs suivants, qui viennent s\u2019ajouter au motif actuel fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille et aux repr\u00e9sailles :\nsexe (f\u00e9minin), origine nationale ou ethnique, race, couleur (car la plaignante est une femme) d\u2019origine chinoise\/asiatique n\u00e9e au Vietnam) ;\net l\u2019alin\u00e9a 10a), en raison des pratiques et des politiques d\u2019embauche de l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui ont emp\u00each\u00e9 une femme pleinement qualifi\u00e9e et appartenant \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible de recevoir une offre d\u2019emploi.\n[15] Les observations de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate, dat\u00e9es du 16 septembre 2010, et en r\u00e9ponse aux observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dat\u00e9es du 24 octobre 2010, se r\u00e9sument comme suit :\nLe Tribunal a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de modifier une plainte afin de traiter des motifs additionnels de distinction illicite et des all\u00e9gations additionnelles, tant que le fond de la plainte d\u2019origine est respect\u00e9 et qu\u2019un avis suffisant ait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e pour qu\u2019elle puisse se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement. La plainte n\u2019ajoute aucun nouvel \u00e9v\u00e9nement, mais ne fait qu\u2019ajouter des motifs de discrimination illicite \u00e0 la plainte d\u2019origine. La Commission a commis une erreur en avisant la plaignante que sa requ\u00eate en modification de la plainte \u00e9tait [Traduction] hors d\u00e9lai. Le fond de la plainte d\u2019origine est respect\u00e9, puisque les motifs de distinction illicites additionnels peuvent \u00eatre d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de renseignements que la plaignante a fournis dans sa demande d\u2019emploi et dans la plainte d\u2019origine. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne subit pas de pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9sentation des motifs additionnels de distinction illicite.\nDans sa r\u00e9ponse aux observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la plaignante a retir\u00e9 l\u2019origine ethnique des motifs additionnels.\n[16] Les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dat\u00e9es du 15 octobre 2010, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la plaignante, se r\u00e9sument ainsi :\nLa modification propos\u00e9e ne divulgue pas le fond des all\u00e9gations. La comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal ne lui permet pas d\u2019instruire de nouvelles plaintes. La modification change fondamentalement les all\u00e9gations et constitue une nouvelle plainte. L\u2019objectif de l\u2019ajout de nouvelles all\u00e9gations n\u2019est pas atteint en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le fait d\u2019accepter la modification causerait un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[17] Les faits \u00e9tablis dans la plainte d\u2019origine sont r\u00e9sum\u00e9s au paragraphe 9 des pr\u00e9sentes. Ce sont les faits au sujet desquels la Commission a fait enqu\u00eate et a fait rapport, qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 le renvoi de la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9crit au paragraphe 13 des pr\u00e9sentes. \u00c0 mon avis, il n\u2019est pas possible de lier de fa\u00e7on logique ces faits aux all\u00e9gations de motifs additionnels de distinction illicite et aux all\u00e9gations de pratique discriminatoire additionnelle que la plaignante propose d\u2019ajouter par la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, comme ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crits dans la plainte modifi\u00e9e et au paragraphe 10 des pr\u00e9sentes, ainsi que dans l\u2019avis d\u2019appel et au paragraphe 14 des pr\u00e9sentes. En l\u2019absence d\u2019un tel lien, il n\u2019existe aucun pouvoir l\u00e9gal pour que le renvoi au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP s\u2019applique \u00e0 la modification propos\u00e9e, qui est la seule fa\u00e7on dont le Tribunal obtient le pouvoir de tenir une instruction. Lorsqu\u2019un nouveau motif propos\u00e9 est plus qu\u2019une simple modification et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit essentiellement d\u2019une nouvelle plainte, ce qui \u00e0 mon avis est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, on ne peut pas dire que la Commission a demand\u00e9 l\u2019instruction de cette plainte et alors, le Tribunal ne peut pas proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une instruction. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), [1991] A.C.F. no 334 [Q.L.], 43 F.T.R.\nPour ce motif, le Tribunal a correctement \u00e9tabli la limite suivante pour les modifications :\nLa Commission, lorsqu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal, doit avoir examin\u00e9 la situation essentielle qui constitue le sujet de l\u2019affaire \u00e0 instruire. Cela cr\u00e9e certaines limites \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des modifications qui doivent avoir leur historique dans les circonstances soumises \u00e0 la Commission. Gaucher c.

Comme les modifications propos\u00e9es constituent une nouvelle plainte sur laquelle la Commission n\u2019a pas enqu\u00eat\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, elle outrepasse la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\n[19] Pour toutes ces raisons, la requ\u00eate en modification est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Agence canadienne du d\u00e9veloppement international et Sant\u00e9 Canada et Jonathon Wheatcroft c. Agence canadienne du d\u00e9veloppement international.\n[2] La plaignante, Mme Cruden, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes \u00e0 la Commission le 8 novembre 2008 bas\u00e9es sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience. Elle soutient que Sant\u00e9 Canada a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP) et que l\u2019ACDI a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Le 26 avril 2010, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire les deux plaintes. Le plaignant, M. Wheatcroft, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte \u00e0 la Commission le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2009 bas\u00e9e sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience. Il soutient que l\u2019ACDI a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 son \u00e9gard au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la LCDP. Le 27 avril 2010, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 44(3)a) de la LCDP, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte. La Commission participera pleinement aux auditions des plaintes Cruden et Wheatcroft. Le 21 octobre 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, l\u2019ACDI, a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de tenir une instruction commune des deux causes. Les deux plaignants s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la jonction de leurs causes.\n[3] Le 21 octobre 2010, Mme Shirish P. Chotalia, c.r., la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate serait tranch\u00e9e sur pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019observations \u00e9crites. La soussign\u00e9e fut d\u00e9sign\u00e9e pour statuer sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[4] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e se r\u00e9sume comme suit :\nLe Tribunal peut ordonner l\u2019instruction commune de plusieurs plaintes qui comportent essentiellement les m\u00eames questions de faits et de droit. Les plaintes ont des questions de faits et de droit communes et la grande majorit\u00e9 de la preuve sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La tenue d\u2019une instruction commune \u00e9vitera la possibilit\u00e9 que des d\u00e9cisions incoh\u00e9rentes soient rendues, elle sera plus efficace et permettra \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal de r\u00e9duire les co\u00fbts qui seraient attribuables \u00e0 la tenue de deux audiences. Il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, puisqu\u2019ils sont fonctionnaires, de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 une seule audience plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 deux, et il est aussi dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur du public d\u2019\u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des instances. Bien que Mme Cruden, qui est enceinte, ait des raisons valides de souhaiter que l\u2019audition de sa plainte ait lieu avant qu\u2019elle accouche, le pr\u00e9judice envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9coulant du rejet de la demande pour une instruction commune l\u2019emporte sur le pr\u00e9judice qui d\u00e9coulerait d\u2019un report de 90 jours des dates d\u2019audience.\nAnalyse [5] Les deux questions dont je suis saisie sont les suivantes :\n[6] Premi\u00e8rement, comme membre du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, ai-je le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019ordonner la jonction des deux causes et, deuxi\u00e8mement, si j\u2019ai ce pouvoir, est-il appropri\u00e9 de rendre une telle ordonnance dans les circonstances en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce ?\n[7] En ce qui concerne la premi\u00e8re question, pour d\u00e9terminer si j\u2019ai le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019ordonner la jonction des causes, il est utile d\u2019examiner les dispositions applicables de la LCDP.\n[8] Le paragraphe 40(4) traite pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment de la capacit\u00e9 de la Commission de joindre des plaintes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par diff\u00e9rents plaignants contre le m\u00eame intim\u00e9, lorsque la Commission est convaincue que les plaintes comportent essentiellement les m\u00eames questions de faits et de droit. Dans de tels cas, la Commission peut aussi demander que le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne ordonne une instruction commune.\n[9] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission n\u2019a pas eu recours au paragraphe 40(4) de la LCDP pour joindre les plaintes de Mme Cruden et de M. Wheatcroft ou pour demander, lors du renvoi des plaintes au Tribunal, que celles-ci fassent l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction commune, m\u00eame si les dates de renvoi ne diff\u00e8rent que d\u2019une journ\u00e9e. La plainte de Mme Cruden a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e le 26 avril 2010 et celle de M. Wheatcroft a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e le 27 avril 2010. Cependant, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses observations \u00e9crites qu\u2019elle souscrivait \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019ACDI en jonction des deux causes.\n[10] Dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal Lattey c. Compagnie de chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique, 2002 CanLII 45928 (T.C.D.P.), les remarques de l\u2019ancienne pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, Anne Mactavish, sont instructives :\n[11] Bien qu\u2019elle fournisse des pr\u00e9cisions quant au pouvoir de la Commission de joindre des plaintes, la Loi est muette en ce qui concerne le pouvoir du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne de joindre ou de s\u00e9parer des plaintes dont il est saisi. \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision de tenir une ou plusieurs audiences rel\u00e8ve de la proc\u00e9dure. En l\u2019absence de directives pr\u00e9cises dans la Loi, il est loisible au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre. [Renvois omis.]\n[11] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je suis convaincue, quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question, que j\u2019ai le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider si ces plaintes devraient faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction commune.\n[12] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me question, je dois maintenant examiner s\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la jonction des causes.\n[13] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 attentivement toutes les preuves qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et j\u2019ai tenu compte de la jurisprudence que toutes les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[14] La d\u00e9cision Lattey est aussi instructive, puisqu\u2019elle cible les facteurs dont il faut tenir compte pour d\u00e9terminer si les affaires devraient \u00eatre jointes, notamment :\nL\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu\u2019il y a \u00e0 \u00e9viter la multiplicit\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures, y compris la r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts, des d\u00e9lais, des inconv\u00e9nients pour les t\u00e9moins, du besoin de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter la preuve et du risque de parvenir \u00e0 des r\u00e9sultats incoh\u00e9rents; Le pr\u00e9judice que pourrait causer aux intim\u00e9s [en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants, qui s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la jonction des causes] une audience unique, notamment en raison du prolongement de la dur\u00e9e de l\u2019audience pour chaque intim\u00e9, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner des questions propres \u00e0 l\u2019autre intim\u00e9, ainsi que du risque de confusion que pourrait engendrer la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ayant peut\u2011\u00eatre pas rapport aux all\u00e9gations mettant en cause particuli\u00e8rement l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre intim\u00e9; L\u2019existence de questions de fait ou de droit communes.\n[15] M\u00eame si les principes de la d\u00e9cision Lattey sont instructifs, je note que l\u2019ancienne pr\u00e9sidente Mactavish n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans sa d\u00e9cision que son \u00e9num\u00e9ration des facteurs pertinents constitue une liste exhaustive. De plus, on ne peut pas faire abstraction des distinctions entre les faits de l\u2019affaire Lattey et les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Dans l\u2019affaire Lattey, l\u2019ancienne pr\u00e9sidente n\u2019\u00e9tait pas confront\u00e9e, comme je le suis, \u00e0 deux plaignants distincts qui en sont \u00e0 de tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal et qui s\u2019opposent \u00e0 l\u2019audition commune de leurs plaintes.\n[16] Comme je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un facteur suppl\u00e9mentaire pertinent quant \u00e0 mon analyse, j\u2019expliquerai plus en d\u00e9tails la question des \u00e9tapes diff\u00e9rentes de chaque affaire devant le tribunal et des consid\u00e9rations connexes: Mme Cruden a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 toutes ses preuves au Tribunal, elle est pr\u00eate \u00e0 aller de l\u2019avant et les dates d\u2019audience sont pr\u00e9vues d\u00e8s le 17 janvier 2011. Elle esp\u00e8re que l\u2019audience sera termin\u00e9e avant son accouchement, qui est pr\u00e9vu en f\u00e9vrier 2011. Dans l\u2019affaire Wheatcroft, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son Expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, qui doit \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au plus tard le 20 d\u00e9cembre 2010. Bien que Mme Cruden subirait le pr\u00e9judice le plus important s\u2019il y avait jonction des causes, M. Wheatcroft, qui s\u2019y oppose \u00e9galement, ne subirait aucun pr\u00e9judice si les affaires \u00e9taient instruites s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\n[17] Si la requ\u00eate est accueillie et que la solution offerte par l\u2019intim\u00e9e est retenue, l\u2019audience sera in\u00e9vitablement divis\u00e9e en deux en raison de la date d\u2019accouchement de Mme Cruden; l\u2019audition d\u2019une partie de sa plainte serait retard\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle accouche ou bien son audience serait retard\u00e9e, cr\u00e9ant de nouvelles difficult\u00e9s pour elle. Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je ne vois pas comment la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e r\u00e9pond ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de l\u2019audience. Il faut examiner cette question en fonction de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public envers le traitement exp\u00e9ditif des plaintes de discrimination (Bell Canada c. Syndicat canadien des communications, de l\u2019\u00e9nergie et du papier, (1997) A.C.F. no 207 (C.F. 1re inst.); voir aussi LCDP, paragraphe 48.9(1)). Cela m\u2019am\u00e8ne au caract\u00e8re opportun de la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Bien que les plaintes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es pour instruction en avril 2010, la requ\u00eate en jonction des deux causes n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e avant la fin octobre. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne m\u2019a pas convaincue de la raison pour laquelle la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 ce moment dans la proc\u00e9dure, et non plus t\u00f4t. Si je proc\u00e9dais de la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e me le demande, cela ajouterait \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9 du processus d\u2019audience et ne prendrait pas suffisamment en compte le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux plaignants, qui s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\n[18] Je reconnais qu\u2019il peut y avoir un certain recoupement de la preuve qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les deux cas au nom de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que la majeure partie du t\u00e9moignage en interrogatoire principal de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans la premi\u00e8re affaire sera r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e dans la deuxi\u00e8me. Cependant, cette r\u00e9p\u00e9tition pourrait possiblement \u00eatre r\u00e9duite par une requ\u00eate ult\u00e9rieure visant \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal, dans la deuxi\u00e8me audience, des transcriptions du t\u00e9moignage en interrogatoire principal de la premi\u00e8re audience. (Bien entendu, une telle requ\u00eate devrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e sur le fond par le membre pr\u00e9sidant \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me audience, probablement apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des observations de toutes les parties.)\n[19] \u00c0 titre d\u2019observation suppl\u00e9mentaire, bien que je reconnaisse qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas d\u00e9sirable pour le Tribunal de rendre des d\u00e9cisions incoh\u00e9rentes ou contradictoires au sujet de la m\u00eame question, je tiens \u00e0 noter qu\u2019une ordonnance visant la jonction des causes Cruden et Wheatcroft n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas la seule fa\u00e7on d\u2019\u00e9viter une telle incoh\u00e9rence. En effet, le besoin d\u2019\u00e9viter les r\u00e9sultats incoh\u00e9rents faisait partie du d\u00e9bat de la Cour supr\u00eame sur la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Toronto (Ville) c. S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63, [2003] 3 R.C.S. 77.\n[20] Ultimement, le pr\u00e9judice que Mme Cruden subirait si ses plaintes n\u2019\u00e9taient pas instruites selon le calendrier \u00e9tabli l\u2019emporte sur les inefficacit\u00e9s qui pourraient d\u00e9couler si des instructions distinctes des affaires \u00e9taient tenues.\n[21] Ma d\u00e9cision aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente si les deux affaires \u00e9taient \u00e0 la m\u00eame \u00e9tape de la divulgation avant l\u2019audience et au m\u00eame degr\u00e9 de pr\u00e9paration pour l\u2019audience. Je souligne l\u2019importance d\u2019une approche en fonction de chaque cas.\n[22] L\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal est assujetti aux r\u00e8gles de la justice naturelle et au r\u00e9gime pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP. L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 comment le r\u00e9sultat qu\u2019elle souhaite obtenir r\u00e9pond mieux \u00e0 la justice naturelle, ni comment il favorise les objectifs pr\u00e9vus par la loi concernant le processus d\u2019instruction, en particulier la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9 et l\u2019obligation de donner \u00e0 toutes les parties l\u2019occasion pleine et enti\u00e8re de participer (LCDP, paragraphe 50(1)).\n[23] Pour tous les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s, la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en jonction des causes est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nSophie Marchildon Juge administrative\nOTTAWA (Ontario) Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2010\nTRIBUNAL canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T1466\/1210 et T1471\/1710\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nBronwyn Cruden c.

Collins, est un d\u00e9tenu incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de Bath (l'\u00e9tablissement) situ\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de Kingston (Ontario). L\u2019\u00e9tablissement est un p\u00e9nitencier \u00e0 s\u00e9curit\u00e9 moyenne g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Service correctionnel du Canada (le SCC). M. Collins souffre de douleurs chroniques et aigu\u00ebs au dos qui limitent sa mobilit\u00e9. Le SCC a une politique qui exige que les d\u00e9tenus se l\u00e8vent et soient compt\u00e9s par des agents de correction au moins une fois par jour, politique qui porte le nom de proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout. M. Collins a demand\u00e9 une exemption de l\u2019exigence de se lever, en raison de la douleur li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience. Il soutient dans sa plainte qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 cet accommodement et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP).\n[2] Plusieurs semaines avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition de la plainte, le SCC a reconnu que M. Collins avait une d\u00e9ficience pour laquelle aucune mesure d\u2019accommodement n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise lors de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le SCC a avis\u00e9 le Tribunal qu\u2019une exemption m\u00e9dicale avait r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Collins gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 laquelle il n\u2019avait plus l\u2019obligation de se lever pour \u00eatre compt\u00e9.\n[3] M. Collins reconna\u00eet que des mesures d\u2019accommodement pour sa d\u00e9ficience ont bien \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre. Cet accommodement \u00e9tait l\u2019une des mesures de redressement qu\u2019il demandait. N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019audience a eu lieu afin de traiter des autres mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es en application de la LCDP, notamment une indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e)) et une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3)).\nI. Les faits A. La d\u00e9ficience de M. Collins [4] Lorsque M. Collins \u00e9tait jeune homme, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 bless\u00e9 dans un violent accident de motocyclette qui l\u2019a gravement bless\u00e9 \u00e0 la colonne vert\u00e9brale. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des ann\u00e9es suivantes, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019autres accidents de v\u00e9hicules motoris\u00e9s qui ont caus\u00e9 d\u2019autres blessures \u00e0 sa colonne vert\u00e9brale. Par cons\u00e9quent, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir des douleurs au dos et au cou qui ont augment\u00e9 avec le temps. Sa mobilit\u00e9 s\u2019en est trouv\u00e9e diminu\u00e9e. Ses maux diagnostiqu\u00e9s m\u00e9dicalement \u00e0 ce jour comptent notamment des disques intervert\u00e9braux herni\u00e9s et des canaux rachidiens r\u00e9tr\u00e9cis. Bien que la douleur soit constante, il est capable de se lever et de marcher. Le fait de passer d\u2019une position couch\u00e9e ou assise \u00e0 la position debout peut \u00eatre en soi particuli\u00e8rement douloureux. L\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente plainte a d\u00fb \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9e une fois parce que la douleur que M. Collins ressentait ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait tellement vive qu\u2019il \u00e9tait incapable de se lever du lit et de marcher jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la chapelle de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, o\u00f9 l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roulait.\n[5] M. Collins est d\u00e9tenu dans des \u00e9tablissements du SCC depuis environ 1982. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, le SCC lui a permis d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9 par plusieurs m\u00e9decins, y compris un certain nombre de sp\u00e9cialistes. Le SCC lui a aussi fourni divers articles pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 g\u00e9rer sa douleur, tels que des matelas offrant un soutien dorsal, des chaises et des bureaux adapt\u00e9s, des coussins chauffants et des coussins de massage, ainsi que des attelles cervicales et des corsets lombaires. De plus, le SCC lui a attribu\u00e9 certains types d\u2019emplois pour d\u00e9tenus qu\u2019il pouvait occuper malgr\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience.\nB. La proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout [6] La plainte de M. Collins porte sur une politique du SCC obligeant les d\u00e9tenus \u00e0 se lever et \u00e0 \u00eatre compt\u00e9s par des agents de correction. Selon Ian Chinnery, qui a un certain temps g\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019unit\u00e9 dans laquelle M. Collins \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu, cette proc\u00e9dure a \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9e en vertu d\u2019une directive du commissaire du SCC (CD\u2011566\u20114), qui pr\u00e9voyait qu\u2019au moins un d\u00e9nombrement debout doit \u00eatre effectu\u00e9 chaque jour dans tous les \u00e9tablissements et les centres correctionnels communautaires du SCC.\n[7] M. Chinnery a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la politique exigeant le d\u00e9nombrement debout a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e \u00e0 la suite de plusieurs incidents malheureux lors desquels des agents de correction avaient v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence des d\u00e9tenus dans leurs cellules sans remarquer que les d\u00e9tenus \u00e9taient malades, bless\u00e9s, ou m\u00eame morts. Cette m\u00e9prise aurait pu \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9e si tous les d\u00e9tenus avaient d\u00fb se lever pour \u00eatre compt\u00e9s.\n[8] L\u2019objectif du d\u00e9nombrement debout \u00e9tait donc l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une norme pour effectuer le d\u00e9nombrement des d\u00e9tenus afin de surveiller leurs all\u00e9es et venues en tout temps et de garantir que tous les d\u00e9tenus [\u2026] sont vivants au moment du d\u00e9nombrement, comme le pr\u00e9cisait la version de la directive d\u2019avant ao\u00fbt 2006. Le d\u00e9nombrement debout a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini comme un d\u00e9nombrement pendant lequel le d\u00e9tenu doit se tenir debout, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de sa cellule ou de la pi\u00e8ce o\u00f9 se trouve son lit. Comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus tard dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, la d\u00e9finition a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e dans une version ult\u00e9rieure de la CD\u2011566\u20114, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9e le 8 ao\u00fbt 2006.\n[9] M. Collins a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement mettait en \u0153uvre la directive et effectuait un d\u00e9nombrement debout par jour, les agents de correction du SCC n\u2019exigeaient pas qu\u2019il se l\u00e8ve en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Bien qu\u2019aucune directive ou politique officielle n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e pour qu\u2019il soit dispens\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, le SCC l\u2019accommodait effectivement. M. Collins soutient que cette pratique a soudainement cess\u00e9 le 30 novembre 2005, lorsque l\u2019une des agentes de correction du SCC lui a ordonn\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois de se lever sans soutien et d\u2019\u00eatre compt\u00e9 (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire sans qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019appuyer sur un objet pour se tenir debout). M. Collins a avis\u00e9 l\u2019agente de correction qu\u2019il \u00e9tait m\u00e9dicalement incapable de se lever \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Elle l\u2019a avis\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une exemption de la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout aupr\u00e8s du directeur de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, sinon il risquait d\u2019\u00eatre accus\u00e9 de manquement \u00e0 la discipline lorsqu\u2019il ne se levait pas pour le d\u00e9nombrement.\n[10] M. Collins a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019accusations dans le dossier de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9tenu, que le d\u00e9tenu en soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 coupable ou non, peut avoir des r\u00e9percussions importantes sur le d\u00e9tenu. Par exemple, elles peuvent affecter la cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du d\u00e9tenu, l\u2019emp\u00eachant ainsi d\u2019obtenir l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 moindre. Elles peuvent m\u00eame entra\u00eener le d\u00e9placement du d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 un \u00e9tablissement o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. On peut aussi refuser des privil\u00e8ges au d\u00e9tenu et ses chances d\u2019obtenir une lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle peuvent aussi \u00eatre affect\u00e9es.\n[11] Par cons\u00e9quent, comme il ne souhaitait pas risquer qu\u2019on l\u2019accuse de manquement \u00e0 la discipline, M. Collins a imm\u00e9diatement demand\u00e9 une exemption au directeur de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. Le m\u00eame jour o\u00f9 il a discut\u00e9 avec l\u2019agente de correction (le 30 novembre 2005), il a envoy\u00e9 une lettre au directeur expliquant l\u2019incident et exprimant ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet du fait que des accusations pouvaient \u00eatre port\u00e9es contre lui. Selon M. Collins, le directeur lui a conseill\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une recommandation m\u00e9dicale aupr\u00e8s du m\u00e9decin de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement. M. Collins a suivi ce conseil et a demand\u00e9 un rendez-vous avec le m\u00e9decin.\n[12] Le 21 d\u00e9cembre 2005, le chef des Services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, Brian Blasko, a appris par un autre employ\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement que M. Collins souhaitait demander une exemption m\u00e9dicale de la proc\u00e9dure du d\u00e9nombrement debout. M. Blasko est un infirmier et il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler comme chef des Services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement deux mois plus t\u00f4t. Ses fonctions comprenaient la gestion de la clinique de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et la garantie de l\u2019acc\u00e8s des d\u00e9tenus aux soins m\u00e9dicaux essentiels. Il coordonnait et supervisait les contrats de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement avec les m\u00e9decins et les dentistes pour la fourniture de services aux d\u00e9tenus. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, entre autres fonctions, il devait s\u2019assurer que les recommandations m\u00e9dicales respectaient les politiques du SCC.\n[13] Lorsqu\u2019il a eu vent de l\u2019intention de M. Collins, M. Blasko a \u00e9crit un courriel en r\u00e9ponse au m\u00eame employ\u00e9, le 22 d\u00e9cembre 2005, dans lequel il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne voyait aucune raison pour laquelle M. Collins ne pouvait pas se tenir debout [Traduction] pendant quelques secondes pour \u00eatre compt\u00e9. M. Blasko a ajout\u00e9 que si M. Collins avait besoin d\u2019une canne ou d\u2019un autre appareil pour s\u2019aider \u00e0 se tenir debout, il pouvait en faire la demande au bureau des Services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement.\n[14] Entre-temps, le 27 d\u00e9cembre 2005, suivant le conseil du directeur, M. Collins a rencontr\u00e9 la Dre Diana Wyatt, un m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste. Elle se consacre exclusivement \u00e0 la fourniture de services m\u00e9dicaux aux d\u00e9tenus dans un certain nombre d\u2019\u00e9tablissements du SCC. Cependant, elle n\u2019est pas une employ\u00e9e du SCC. Le SCC a recours \u00e0 ses services \u00e0 titre d\u2019entrepreneure.\n[15] La Dre Wyatt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lors de sa rencontre avec M. Collins, il a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il souhaitait obtenir une recommandation m\u00e9dicale quant \u00e0 savoir si on devait exiger qu\u2019il se l\u00e8ve pendant la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout. Selon son avis m\u00e9dical, il \u00e9tait plus simple si son patient n\u2019avait pas \u00e0 se lever. Elle a \u00e9crit une note \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard dans le dossier m\u00e9dical de M. Collins. Elle y a aussi inscrit une autre note pr\u00e9cisant que le chef des Services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement (M. Blasko) r\u00e9glerait la question. La Dre Wyatt a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il est pratique courante qu\u2019elle attribue l\u2019application de ses recommandations au chef des Services de sant\u00e9.\n[16] M. Collins croyait, apr\u00e8s sa rencontre avec la Dre Wyatt, qu\u2019elle ferait une recommandation \u00e9crite pour qu\u2019il soit dispens\u00e9 de l\u2019obligation de se lever.\n[17] M. Blasko a vu la note de la Dre Wyatt dans le dossier m\u00e9dical de M. Collins quelques jours plus tard. Ce que M. Blasko savait de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 de M. Collins \u00e0 partir de son dossier m\u00e9dical, c\u2019est que M. Collins n\u2019utilisait pas de fauteuil roulant, qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas paralys\u00e9 et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t mobile. Tenant compte des exigences de la directive CD\u2011566\u20114, il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de discuter avec la Dre Wyatt \u00e0 ce sujet. La Dre Wyatt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne connaissait pas les directives du commissaire et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait re\u00e7u aucune formation \u00e0 leur sujet. Avant de rencontrer M. Collins, elle n\u2019avait aucune connaissance au sujet de la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout.\n[18] M. Blasko a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Dre Wyatt la politique du d\u00e9nombrement debout et son objectif visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des d\u00e9tenus. Il lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il serait acceptable pour M. Collins de devoir se tenir debout tout en pouvant s\u2019appuyer sur un mur ou une chaise. Selon M. Blasko, elle a convenu que cette exigence ne poserait aucun probl\u00e8me \u00e0 M. Collins.\n[19] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 11 janvier 2006, le sous-directeur a officiellement r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la demande d\u2019exemption m\u00e9dicale de M. Collins en d\u00e9clarant que les Services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement avaient confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune raison m\u00e9dicale pour laquelle il ne pouvait pas se tenir debout sans aide pendant [Traduction] quelques secondes pendant le d\u00e9nombrement. N\u00e9anmoins, le 13 janvier 2006, les Services de sant\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement ont \u00e9mis une recommandation \u00e9crite permettant \u00e0 M. Collins [Traduction] d\u2019utiliser un objet lorsqu\u2019il doit se tenir debout pendant des p\u00e9riodes prolong\u00e9es, tel que le mur ou un bureau.\n[20] La recommandation \u00e9tait \u00e9crite \u00e0 la main par M. Blasko. Il a inscrit le nom de la Dre Wyatt au bas en lettres moul\u00e9es, au-dessus de la ligne o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit [Traduction] m\u00e9decin. Il a appos\u00e9 sa propre signature au-dessus de la ligne o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait \u00e9crit [Traduction] infirmier. La Dre Wyatt a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une pratique courante pour elle et les autres m\u00e9decins, soit de donner des instructions ou des recommandations \u00e0 un infirmier, qui par la suite les \u00e9crit, en particulier lorsqu\u2019elle doit quitter pour s\u2019occuper d\u2019un autre cas et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas le temps de terminer et de signer la recommandation elle-m\u00eame.\n[21] M. Blasko a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important qu\u2019il existe un document confirmant que M. Collins pouvait se tenir debout en s\u2019appuyant sur un mur ou une chaise. Si un tel document n\u2019existait pas, les agents de correction qui effectuaient le d\u00e9nombrement pourraient par erreur supposer qu\u2019il s\u2019appuyait sur des objets parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait bless\u00e9 et qu\u2019il ne pouvait donc pas se tenir debout sans aide. M. Blasko a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u2019avis que le fait d\u2019accorder la permission \u00e0 M. Collins d\u2019utiliser un appui lorsqu\u2019il se tenait debout \u00e9tait une forme d\u2019accommodement.\n[22] Il n\u2019est pas clair si on a exig\u00e9 que M. Collins se tienne debout pendant le d\u00e9nombrement au cours des semaines suivant imm\u00e9diatement la note, mais le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2006, M. Collins a eu un autre rendez-vous avec la Dre Wyatt. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame se tenir debout en s\u2019appuyant sur un mur lui posait probl\u00e8me, parce qu\u2019il devait parfois se tenir debout pendant le d\u00e9nombrement de tous les d\u00e9tenus, une p\u00e9riode qui pouvait durer de 20 \u00e0 30 minutes. La Dre Wyatt a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait de se tenir debout aussi longtemps, m\u00eame en se tenant sur un mur, serait extr\u00eamement douloureux.\n[23] La Dre Wyatt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, elle ne connaissait toujours pas les d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis de la fa\u00e7on dont le d\u00e9nombrement debout \u00e9tait effectu\u00e9 et que, alors, en fonction du r\u00e9cit de M. Collins, elle a chang\u00e9 sa recommandation et a \u00e9crit une nouvelle note au gestionnaire de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de M. Collins (M. Chinnery) dans laquelle elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[Traduction] La recommandation suivante a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e :\nIl peut y avoir des occasions lors desquelles, en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, le d\u00e9tenu doit rester couch\u00e9 ou assis, ou doit se tenir debout en se soutenant pendant le d\u00e9nombrement debout.\n[24] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la note de la Dre Wyatt, M. Chinnery a discut\u00e9 avec M. Blasko \u00e0 ce sujet. Ils \u00e9taient d\u2019avis que la recommandation entra\u00eenait une certaine ambig\u00fcit\u00e9.\n[25] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2006, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la note de la Dre Wyatt, M. Chinnery lui a envoy\u00e9 une note en r\u00e9ponse dans laquelle il exprimait des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de sa recommandation, parce qu\u2019elle laissait entendre que M. Collins pouvait d\u00e9cider s\u2019il \u00e9tait en mesure de se tenir debout pour le d\u00e9nombrement. Selon M. Chinnery, en raison de la recommandation, il \u00e9tait difficile pour l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019appliquer la directive CD\u2011566\u20114. Il a fait remarquer \u00e0 la Dre Wyatt que ses recommandations m\u00e9dicales \u00e9taient assujetties aux exigences de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du SCC et que le d\u00e9nombrement debout \u00e9tait l\u2019une de ces exigences. Par cons\u00e9quent, sa recommandation n\u2019\u00e9tait [Traduction] simplement [\u2026] pas conforme aux directives du SCC. M. Chinnery a affirm\u00e9 que si, \u00e0 un certain moment, M. Collins \u00e9tait incapable de se lever, il pouvait demander une intervention m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 et \u00eatre transf\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la clinique pour diagnostic et traitement.\n[26] M. Chinnery a donc pr\u00e9par\u00e9 une note pour la Dre Wyatt dans laquelle il lui a demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9examiner et de modifier sa recommandation afin qu\u2019elle ne dise plus que M. Collins peut devoir rester assis ou couch\u00e9, mais qu\u2019elle dise plut\u00f4t que parfois, il avait besoin d\u2019aide pour rester debout.\n[27] Avant d\u2019envoyer la note \u00e0 la Dre Wyatt, M. Chinnery a envoy\u00e9 une \u00e9bauche, dans une pi\u00e8ce jointe \u00e0 un courriel, au sous-directeur de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, lui demandant ses commentaires et son approbation. Dans son courriel, M. Chinnery a \u00e9crit qu\u2019il aimerait obtenir une r\u00e9ponse rapidement [Traduction] afin que Collins ne se mette pas \u00e0 jouer des tours lors du d\u00e9nombrement. M. Chinnery a expliqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il voulait dire par l\u00e0 que si M. Collins se tenait debout lors d\u2019un d\u00e9nombrement, et ne se levait pas lors d\u2019un autre, cela pouvait inciter les agents de correction \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des accusations contre lui ou pouvait entra\u00eener une confrontation entre M. Collins et les agents. M. Chinnery \u00e9tait convaincu que l\u2019application de la recommandation de la Dre Wyatt aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s perturbateur pour l\u2019unit\u00e9 dans laquelle M. Collins \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu.\n[28] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la note de M. Chinnery, la Dre Wyatt a discut\u00e9 avec M. Blasko. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui avait donn\u00e9 deux nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments d\u2019information qu\u2019elle ignorait jusque-l\u00e0. Premi\u00e8rement, le fait qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, M. Collins et les autres d\u00e9tenus ne devaient pas se tenir debout pendant 20 minutes comme M. Collins l\u2019avait laiss\u00e9 entendre, mais plut\u00f4t pendant deux minutes tout au plus. Deuxi\u00e8mement, la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en place comme mesure de protection de la sant\u00e9 et de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des d\u00e9tenus, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019un incident eut lieu dans un autre \u00e9tablissement : un d\u00e9tenu qui \u00e9tait malade avait \u00e9t\u00e9 compt\u00e9, sans que les agents de correction n\u2019aient r\u00e9alis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait besoin de soins m\u00e9dicaux urgents.\n[29] Apr\u00e8s cette conversation, la Dre Wyatt a pr\u00e9vu un autre rendez-vous m\u00e9dical avec M. Collins. Ils se sont rencontr\u00e9s le 2 mars 2006 et la Dre Wyatt l\u2019a avis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle allait r\u00e9ajuster sa recommandation pour qu\u2019elle se lise comme suit :\n[Traduction] Il peut y avoir des moments o\u00f9 le dos de M. Collins rende la position debout ou assise difficile. Cependant, je reconnais que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 prime et, par cons\u00e9quent, M. Collins sait qu\u2019actuellement, il doit se tenir debout d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre pendant le d\u00e9nombrement.\n[30] La Dre Wyatt a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que personne ne l\u2019avait forc\u00e9e \u00e0 changer sa recommandation et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019aise avec sa d\u00e9cision. Elle se souvient que M. Collins a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il devait se tenir debout pendant toute la dur\u00e9e du d\u00e9nombrement, mais elle lui a r\u00e9pondu que, selon ce qu\u2019elle avait compris, il ne se tenait debout que pendant une courte p\u00e9riode. Tant la Dre Wyatt que M. Blasko, qui \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 la rencontre, ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Collins n\u2019a pas r\u00e9agi, ni de fa\u00e7on positive, ni de fa\u00e7on n\u00e9gative, \u00e0 cette mise au point.\n[31] La Dre Wyatt a de nouveau rencontr\u00e9 M. Collins lors d\u2019un rendez-vous m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9vu, le 23 mai 2006. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien que la discussion ait principalement port\u00e9 sur sa gestion de la douleur, il lui avait aussi demand\u00e9 de changer sa recommandation au sujet du d\u00e9nombrement debout. Elle a refus\u00e9.\nC. Des accusations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es deux fois [32] Selon la preuve dont le Tribunal est saisi, des accusations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es contre M. Collins pour son d\u00e9faut de se lever par deux fois, le 28 mai 2007 et le 19 novembre 2007. L\u2019issue de ces accusations n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve.\nD. M. Collins a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des griefs [33] En application de la Loi sur le syst\u00e8me correctionnel et la mise en libert\u00e9 sous condition, L.C. 1992, ch. 20, le CSC offre un recours aux d\u00e9linquants. Le 25 avril 2006, M. Collins a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief en application de cette proc\u00e9dure, soutenant que M. Chinnery s\u2019\u00e9tait interpos\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on indue dans les recommandations m\u00e9dicales de la Dre Wyatt. Sa plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Insatisfait de ce r\u00e9sultat, M. Collins a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief au premier palier (au niveau de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement) le 23 mai 2006, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure pr\u00e9vue. Il soutenait que M. Chinnery faisait preuve de partialit\u00e9 contre lui et avait agi [Traduction] d\u2019une fa\u00e7on punitive, qui [Traduction] visait d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e0 infliger des douleurs et des pr\u00e9judices \u00e0 M. Collins.\n[34] Le 12 juin 2006, le sous-directeur de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement a rejet\u00e9 le grief, concluant que M. Chinnery avait agi correctement. M. Collins a alors pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un grief au deuxi\u00e8me palier (r\u00e9gional) le 20 juin 2006. Il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Chinnery avait [Traduction] d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui causer des douleurs et des pr\u00e9judices. Ce grief a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 3 avril 2007, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait not\u00e9 que M. Chinnery avait agi correctement en avisant la Dre Wyatt que sa premi\u00e8re recommandation entrait en confli avec la politique du d\u00e9nombrement debout.\n[35] M. Collins a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief au troisi\u00e8me palier (national) apr\u00e8s cette d\u00e9cision, dans lequel il a non seulement r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 ses all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes contre M. Chinnery, mais s\u2019est aussi plaint du temps qu\u2019il avait fallu avant que la d\u00e9cision ne soit rendue. M. Collins a not\u00e9 dans son grief que M. Chinnery, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, travaillait \u00e0 la Division des recours des d\u00e9linquants \u00e0 l\u2019administration r\u00e9gionale, d\u2019o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue. M. Chinnery a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2006 et en 2007, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tach\u00e9 aux divisions des recours des d\u00e9linquants, tant \u00e0 l\u2019administration r\u00e9gionale qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019administration nationale du SCC. Cependant, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais servi d\u2019analyste dans les griefs de M. Collins.\n[36] La d\u00e9cision nationale au dernier palier concluait que la note de M. Chinnery \u00e0 la Dre Wyatt ne pouvait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une tentative d\u2019ing\u00e9rence malicieuse ou de harc\u00e8lement, et cette partie du grief a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Cependant, il a aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 qu\u2019en raison des retards attribu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 des griefs trait\u00e9s au niveau r\u00e9gional, M. Collins n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse dans un d\u00e9lai appropri\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette partie du grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 accueillie. M. Chinnery a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il y avait eu de graves retards \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque dans le traitement de tous les griefs \u00e0 l\u2019administration r\u00e9gionale de l\u2019Ontario. L\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles on lui avait demand\u00e9 d\u2019aller travailler \u00e0 la Division des recours des d\u00e9linquants \u00e9tait qu\u2019il devait aider \u00e0 \u00e9liminer cet arri\u00e9r\u00e9.\nE. Les changements \u00e0 la directive CD-566-4 [37] \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 on a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 demander \u00e0 M. Collins de se lever pour le d\u00e9nombrement, en novembre 2005, la directive CD-566-4 d\u00e9finissait le d\u00e9nombrement debout comme un d\u00e9nombrement pendant lequel le d\u00e9tenu doit se tenir debout, \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur ou \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de sa cellule ou de la pi\u00e8ce o\u00f9 se trouve son lit. Il n\u2019y avait aucune disposition dans la directive quant aux personnes pour lesquelles une d\u00e9ficience pouvait les emp\u00eacher de se lever.\n[38] Cependant, la directive CD-566-4 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e le 8 ao\u00fbt 2006 et comprend depuis une d\u00e9finition diff\u00e9rente du d\u00e9nombrement debout, qui pr\u00e9voit la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un d\u00e9tenu soit incapable de se lever en raison d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 physique ou de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 :\nD\u00e9nombrement debout : D\u00e9nombrement officiel des d\u00e9tenus, qui doivent se tenir debout et faire face \u00e0 l'employ\u00e9 proc\u00e9dant au d\u00e9nombrement afin de permettre leur identification physionomique, sauf dans les cas o\u00f9 des exemptions pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales ou \u00e0 cause de limitations physiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9es.\n[39] La directive d\u00e9crit aussi maintenant un autre moyen par lequel les d\u00e9tenus exempt\u00e9s peuvent \u00eatre compt\u00e9s :\nLes d\u00e9tenus qui, pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales ou \u00e0 cause de limitations physiques, ne sont pas en mesure, selon le chef des Services de sant\u00e9 ou le titulaire d'un poste \u00e9quivalent, d'ob\u00e9ir \u00e0 un ordre de se tenir debout donn\u00e9 dans le cadre d'un d\u00e9nombrement ne sont pas tenus de le faire. Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, le d\u00e9tenu doit toutefois \u00eatre \u00e9veill\u00e9 et doit signaler sa pr\u00e9sence au personnel d'une autre fa\u00e7on, habituellement par un signe de la main.\n[40] Cependant, la modification \u00e0 la directive n\u2019a eu aucun effet sur M. Collins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 peu de temps avant l\u2019audience, auquel moment, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, le SCC a reconnu que M. Collins avait une d\u00e9ficience. Il a obtenu une exemption m\u00e9dicale et a \u00e9t\u00e9 accommod\u00e9 conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la directive.\nF. L\u2019interaction de M. Collins avec M. Chinnery et l\u2019administration du SCC [41] M. Collins soutient que le SCC, et M. Chinnery en particulier, en exigeant qu\u2019il se tienne debout, ont agi d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui et sa d\u00e9ficience. Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, M. Collins a soutenu dans son grief que M. Chinnery faisait preuve de partialit\u00e9 envers lui et qu\u2019il avait agi de fa\u00e7on [Traduction] punitive. M. Collins a soulev\u00e9 une objection \u00e0 l\u2019[Traduction] ing\u00e9rence malicieuse de M. Chinnery dans ses efforts d\u2019obtenir une exemption m\u00e9dicale du d\u00e9nombrement debout. Comme je l\u2019ai aussi mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, M. Collins soutient que cette partialit\u00e9 a aussi touch\u00e9 le traitement de son grief, puisque M. Chinnery travaillait \u00e0 la Division des recours des d\u00e9linquants pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle le grief de M. Collins a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9.\n[42] M. Collins a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que ses interactions avec les employ\u00e9s du SCC ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tendues tout au long de son incarc\u00e9ration. En 1994, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement correctionnel de Joyceville, par exemple, il soutient qu\u2019on lui a refus\u00e9 des privil\u00e8ges parce qu\u2019il avait accus\u00e9 un agent de correction de lui avoir vol\u00e9 quelque chose. M. Collins a aussi soutenu qu\u2019un certain nombre de fausses accusations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es contre lui au cours des ann\u00e9es, accusations dont il a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 exon\u00e9r\u00e9. Entre-temps, cependant, les employ\u00e9s du SCC qui traitaient avec lui \u00e0 tous les jours avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 percevoir de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9favorable ses plaintes. M. Blasko travaillait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de Joyceville alors que M. Collins s\u2019y trouvait.\n[43] Une autre tension entre M. Collins et le personnel du SCC a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de caricatures controvers\u00e9es et d\u2019autres dessins qu\u2019il a faits vers 1998, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans des expositions publiques et qui ont fait la manchette dans certains journaux. Certains des dessins critiquaient les employ\u00e9s du SCC et les policiers, ce qui a particuli\u00e8rement attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention compte tenu du fait que M. Collins purge une peine pour le meurtre d\u2019un policier.\n[44] Entre 1999 et 2001, M. Chinnery a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019agent de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement pour M. Collins. M. Chinnery a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsque M. Collins est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, il existait des appr\u00e9hensions au sujet de ses interactions ant\u00e9rieures avec les employ\u00e9s du SCC, en particulier au sujet de ses caricatures et de ses dessins. Le directeur \u00e9tait inquiet de la mauvaise image donn\u00e9e des policiers et de la publicit\u00e9 que les dessins feraient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et \u00e0 M. Collins, compte tenu du crime pour lequel il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 condamn\u00e9. M. Chinnery a reconnu que pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle il \u00e9tait l\u2019agent de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle de M. Collins, il avait personnellement \u00e9t\u00e9 humili\u00e9 par l\u2019un des dessins de M. Collins, qui \u00e0 son avis \u00e9tait un portrait bien net de lui qui le pr\u00e9sentait de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9savantageuse. M. Chinnery nie cat\u00e9goriquement, cependant, avoir us\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles contre M. Collins d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelconque, y compris dans ses actions au sujet de la question du d\u00e9nombrement debout.\n[45] M. Collins soutient aussi que le SCC lui a refus\u00e9 l\u2019utilisation d\u2019un d\u00e9ambulateur pour se d\u00e9placer dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et il a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage une d\u00e9claration que M. Chinnery avait faite dans sa note \u00e0 la Dre Wyatt du 14 f\u00e9vrier 2006, selon laquelle il d\u00e9ployait tous les efforts pour fournir \u00e0 M. Collins un support de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision qui lui permettrait de regarder l\u2019\u00e9cran de fa\u00e7on plus confortable. M. Collins soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u le support de t\u00e9l\u00e9vision. Il soutient aussi que la d\u00e9cision de M. Blasko de discuter de la recommandation m\u00e9dicale de la Dre Wyatt avec le directeur et d\u2019autres personnes constitue une divulgation non autoris\u00e9e de ses renseignements personnels et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit ainsi d\u2019un manquement \u00e0 la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels. M. Collins soutient que ces actes d\u00e9montrent que M. Blasko avait [Traduction] des probl\u00e8mes de longue date avec lui, qui remontaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de Joyceville au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 M. Blasko y travaillait.\n[46] M. Collins soutient, par cons\u00e9quent, que l\u2019animosit\u00e9 personnelle de M. Chinnery envers lui et sa relation difficile avec M. Blasko et avec les employ\u00e9s du SCC en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019on a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\nII. La plainte est fond\u00e9e [47] Le SCC a reconnu que M. Collins a une d\u00e9ficience. En raison de cette d\u00e9ficience, comme M. Collins l\u2019a dit pendant l\u2019audience, le fait de se lever pour le d\u00e9nombrement lui cause des douleurs physiques et de l\u2019inconfort. Le SCC a aussi reconnu que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 peu de temps avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, il n\u2019avait pas pris de mesure d\u2019accommodement pour la d\u00e9ficience de M. Collins pour la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout. M. Collins soutient que ce d\u00e9faut d\u2019accommodement constitue une distinction illicite dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public, distinction fond\u00e9e sur le motif de la d\u00e9ficience, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP. Le SCC n\u2019a pas ni\u00e9 ni r\u00e9fut\u00e9 cette all\u00e9gation.\n[48] Compte tenu des circonstances, le Tribunal conclut que la plainte est fond\u00e9e.\nIII. Redressements A. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral (alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP) [49] L'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu'\u00e0 l'issue de l'instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e peut ordonner \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d'un acte discriminatoire d'indemniser jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral en raison de l'acte discriminatoire. M. Collins demande le montant maximal de 20 000 $.\n[50] En raison du d\u00e9faut du SCC d\u2019accommoder M. Collins pour sa d\u00e9ficience, ce dernier a d\u00fb se lever pour le d\u00e9nombrement debout. Le SCC soutient que M. Collins souffre de douleurs chroniques en raison de blessures au dos qui datent d\u2019avant son incarc\u00e9ration, qu\u2019il se l\u00e8ve ou non. Par cons\u00e9quent, le SCC soutient qu\u2019il ne devrait pas avoir \u00e0 indemniser M. Collins pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Cependant, je suis convaincu par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Collins, qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit \u00e0 ce sujet, que le fait de se lever lui cause des douleurs suppl\u00e9mentaires. C\u2019est cette aggravation de sa douleur chronique qui n\u00e9cessitait un accommodement. Si le fait de se lever ne lui causait aucun probl\u00e8me, la Dre Wyatt n\u2019aurait pas inscrit une note dans son dossier m\u00e9dical et n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9mis de recommandation. Je suis convaincu que le fait d\u2019exiger que M. Collins se l\u00e8ve lui causait des douleurs suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents degr\u00e9s, selon son \u00e9tat ce jour\u2011l\u00e0, par rapport aux douleurs qu\u2019il aurait ressenties s\u2019il \u00e9tait rest\u00e9 assis ou couch\u00e9.\n[51] J\u2019accepte aussi le t\u00e9moignage de M. Collins selon lequel il a v\u00e9cu un certain niveau d\u2019angoisse en raison de la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre vis\u00e9 par des accusations ou d\u2019autres repr\u00e9sailles s\u2019il ne se conformait pas aux ordres des agents de correction qui voulaient qu\u2019il se l\u00e8ve pour le d\u00e9nombrement.\n[52] Compte tenu des circonstances, je conclus que M. Collins a droit \u00e0 7 000 $ en indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP.\nB. Indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale (paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP) [53] Le paragraphe 53(3) pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ s'il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l'acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9. M. Collins demande le montant maximal de 20 000 $. Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Johnstone c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2010 TCDP 20, au paragraphe 379, le montant maximal est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux cas les plus graves.\n[54] M. Collins soutient que le SCC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui tant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e qu\u2019inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[55] Un des facteurs importants dont je dois tenir compte pour d\u00e9terminer si le SCC a agi de fa\u00e7on inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans son acte discriminatoire est ax\u00e9 sur les interventions de MM. Blasko et Chinnery dans les \u00e9valuations du m\u00e9decin de M. Collins, la Dre Wyatt, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Selon M. Blasko, M. Collins \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t mobile et il croyait que, comme M. Collins ne se d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait pas en chaise roulante et n\u2019\u00e9tait pas paralys\u00e9, le fait de se lever pour le d\u00e9nombrement ne devrait pas \u00eatre un probl\u00e8me. M. Chinnery croyait que la recommandation de la Dre Wyatt, bien qu\u2019elle fut fond\u00e9e sur son expertise m\u00e9dicale, posait des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement quant \u00e0 l\u2019application de la directive CD\u2011566\u20114. \u00c0 son avis, la recommandation m\u00e9dicale n\u2019\u00e9tait [Traduction] simplement pas conforme aux directives. Cet avis ne tenait cependant pas compte du fait que M. Collins avait une d\u00e9ficience et que, selon la Dre Wyatt, il avait besoin d\u2019accommodement. La pr\u00e9occupation principale de M. Chinnery \u00e9tait l\u2019application correcte de la directive et non l\u2019accommodement de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Collins.\n[56] Le SCC note que m\u00eame si la motivation de MM. Blasko et Chinnery \u00e9tait d\u2019appliquer les directives appropri\u00e9es, la Dre Wyatt, de son avis professionnel, \u00e9tait [Traduction] \u00e0 l\u2019aise avec les changements propos\u00e9s par les deux employ\u00e9s du SCC. Par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019accommoder M. Collins. Cependant, cet argument ne concorde pas avec l\u2019admission du SCC (et, ultimement, la conclusion du Tribunal) selon laquelle il n\u2019a pas accommod\u00e9 M. Collins et sa d\u00e9ficience. Le renversement de la recommandation du m\u00e9decin est, en fonction de la preuve, enti\u00e8rement explicable. Comme M. Collins l\u2019a not\u00e9, bien que la Dre Wyatt ne f\u00fbt pas officiellement une employ\u00e9e, durant les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, elle travaillait essentiellement et exclusivement pour le SCC. Comme elle n\u2019avait aucune connaissance personnelle pr\u00e9alable de la directive du commissaire au sujet du d\u00e9nombrement debout, elle a fait preuve d\u2019un haut niveau de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence envers les renseignements et les conseils fournis par les employ\u00e9s du SCC, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire MM. Blasko et Chinnery.\n[57] Par cons\u00e9quent, il est \u00e9vident que les employ\u00e9s du SCC, MM. Blasko et Chinnery, se sont efforc\u00e9s de faire annuler la recommandation initiale du m\u00e9decin de M. Collins et de la faire remplacer par des conditions qui seraient conformes \u00e0 la directive. Le SCC souligne que cela n\u2019existe que dans le contexte unique d\u2019un \u00e9tablissement de correction \u00e0 s\u00e9curit\u00e9 moyenne et que d\u2019autres questions sont en jeu que celles qui existent normalement dans des cas plus typiques d\u2019accommodement. Cependant, le SCC n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve et n\u2019a pas soutenu qu\u2019il existait un motif justifiable pour la diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable de M. Collins, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) de la LCDP. Le SCC n\u2019a pas non plus soutenu que le fait d\u2019accommoder M. Collins lui aurait impos\u00e9 une contrainte excessive, au sens du paragraphe 5(2). De plus, je note que la directive CD\u2011566\u20114 m\u00eame a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e pour pr\u00e9ciser qu\u2019un d\u00e9tenu peut \u00eatre dispens\u00e9 de l\u2019exigence de se lever pour le d\u00e9nombrement pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame le SCC a finalement reconnu officiellement la raisonnabilit\u00e9 du type d\u2019accommodement que M. Collins cherchait \u00e0 obtenir.\n[58] Compte tenu de toutes ces circonstances, je conclus que MM. Blasko et Chinnery n\u2019ont pas suffisamment tenu compte de la douleur physique possible qui pouvait \u00eatre caus\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Collins lorsqu\u2019ils ont tent\u00e9 de faire renverser les recommandations initiales de la Dre Wyatt et qu\u2019ils ont r\u00e9ussi. Ils ont plut\u00f4t tir\u00e9 leurs propres conclusions au sujet de sa capacit\u00e9 de se tenir debout pour le d\u00e9nombrement et ont r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire changer d\u2019avis la Dre Wyatt. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils n\u2019ont pas tenu compte de la demande de M. Collins et de son besoin d\u2019accommodement et s\u2019en sont tenus \u00e0 la politique du d\u00e9nombrement debout du SCC. Ces employ\u00e9s du SCC auraient d\u00fb savoir que le fait d\u2019agir de cette fa\u00e7on constituait une pratique discriminatoire. Il \u00e9tait tout de m\u00eame inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de leur part d\u2019agir de cette fa\u00e7on.\n[59] D\u2019autre part, je ne suis pas convaincu que la pratique discriminatoire \u00e9tait intentionnelle. Bien que la preuve fasse \u00e9tat du fait que M. Chinnery n\u2019\u00e9tait pas particuli\u00e8rement heureux de certaines activit\u00e9s de M. Collins (en particulier en ce qui a trait aux caricatures), et que les employ\u00e9s du SCC au cours des ann\u00e9es ont parfois vu M. Collins comme un d\u00e9tenu difficile, la preuve n\u2019est pas suffisante pour appuyer une conclusion selon laquelle le SCC ou ses employ\u00e9s ont agi intentionnellement de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers M. Collins. L\u2019all\u00e9gation de ce dernier selon laquelle M. Chinnery \u00e9tait motiv\u00e9 par le d\u00e9sir de d\u00e9cider personnellement du moment pendant lequel M. Collins serait debout et de lui causer des douleurs suppl\u00e9mentaires n\u2019est pas du tout fond\u00e9e. Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de douter du t\u00e9moignage de M. Chinnery selon lequel sa seule intention, \u00e0 toutes les p\u00e9riodes pertinentes, \u00e9tait d\u2019appliquer les directives du SCC. Je ne rel\u00e8ve aucun fondement non plus aux doutes de M. Collins selon lesquels M. Chinnery se serait immisc\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on quelconque dans le traitement de son grief ou qu\u2019il y aurait caus\u00e9 un retard, alors que des retards affectaient apparemment tous les dossiers, et non seulement celui de M. Collins.\n[60] Compte tenu des circonstances, je conclus qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale de 2 500 $, en application du paragraphe 53(3) de la LDCP, est appropri\u00e9e.\nC. Autres mesures de redressement [61] Dans ses observations finales, M. Collins a demand\u00e9 diverses autres mesures de redressement. Ces mesures comprennent le fait que le SCC soit oblig\u00e9 de fournir des si\u00e8ges dans la salle de visite, la salle de courrier et la salle de biblioth\u00e8que de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et que des rampes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 soient ajout\u00e9es dans les toilettes et dans les douches. Il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve au sujet de sa demande. De plus, M. Collins demande qu\u2019on lui donne un d\u00e9ambulateur. Bien qu\u2019il ait mentionn\u00e9 parfois dans son t\u00e9moignage ses demandes pour obtenir un tel appareil de soutien, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question enti\u00e8rement parall\u00e8le aux questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, de toute fa\u00e7on, la mention dans la preuve n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisante pour soutenir une conclusion \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[62] Enfin, M. Collins a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le SCC soit [Traduction] oblig\u00e9 de garantir qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura pas de repr\u00e9sailles subreptices ou directes. M. Collins a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que depuis que le SCC a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accommoder officiellement pendant la proc\u00e9dure de d\u00e9nombrement debout, il avait senti que certains des agents de correction du SCC se sentaient [Traduction] diminu\u00e9s, ce qui les a encourag\u00e9s \u00e0 passer des commentaires \u00e0 son sujet. Il a exprim\u00e9 l\u2019espoir que ces commentaires cessent. La preuve ne justifie pas que je rende une ordonnance telle que le demande M. Collins dans ses observations finales. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision devrait donner \u00e0 toutes les parties des indications suffisantes sur la fa\u00e7on dont elles doivent se comporter en ce qui a trait aux questions en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Si quelqu\u2019un use de repr\u00e9sailles ou d\u2019intimidation quelconque au sens des articles 14.1 et 59 de la LCDP, un recours distinct peut \u00eatre disponible en application de ces dispositions.\n[63] Pour ces motifs, la demande de M. Collins pour ces autres mesures de redressement est rejet\u00e9e.\nIV. Ordonnance [64] Le Tribunal ordonne au SCC de payer \u00e0 M. Collins une indemnit\u00e9 de 7 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP et une indemnit\u00e9 de 2 500 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale au sens du paragraphe 53(3).\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios D.

Introduction [1] Le 16 avril 2008, le membre du Tribunal Karen A. Jensen a conclu, dans Tahmourpour c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), que la plainte de discrimination dont il \u00e9tait question dans cette cause \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e.\n[2] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a infirm\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du membre Jensen, mais celle\u2011ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9tablie par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, sauf en ce qui concerne l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration no (iv) \u00e9nonc\u00e9e ci\u2011dessous. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de r\u00e9examiner cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\n[3] Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Jensen de r\u00e9examiner l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration, mais celle\u2011ci a respectueusement refus\u00e9, et le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal m\u2019a confi\u00e9 cette t\u00e2che.\nII. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures [4] Le 21 mars 2001, M. Ali Tahmourpour a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne contre la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC). Il pr\u00e9tend que la GRC a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers lui, en contravention des articles 7 et 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la Loi). La plainte de M. Tahmourpour a \u00e9t\u00e9 instruite devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le TCDP) en ao\u00fbt et septembre 2007. Dans une d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 16 avril 2008, le membre Jensen a conclu que la plainte \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs \u00e9gards. En vertu du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 53(2) de la Loi, le membre Jensen a rendu les ordonnances de r\u00e9paration suivantes :\nSauf entente contraire, l'intim\u00e9e offrira \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour la chance de s'inscrire au prochain Programme d'instruction des cadets de la GRC au D\u00e9p\u00f4t ; Si M. Tahmourpour accepte l'offre de r\u00e9admission, l'intim\u00e9e \u00e9valuera \u00e9quitablement ses habilet\u00e9s d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but du programme de formation dans le but de d\u00e9terminer les domaines dans lesquels il a besoin de formation ; L'intim\u00e9e versera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire et les avantages sociaux qu'il aurait touch\u00e9s durant les premiers deux ans et douze semaines de travail en tant que policier de la GRC apr\u00e8s l'obtention du dipl\u00f4me au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L'indemnit\u00e9 sera diminu\u00e9e de 8 % ; L'intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l'industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l'\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu'il aurait touch\u00e9 en tant que policier de la GRC jusqu'\u00e0 ce que M. Tahmourpour accepte ou rejette l'offre de r\u00e9admission au programme de formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L'intim\u00e9e versera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le montant moyen pay\u00e9 pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires aux autres agents dipl\u00f4m\u00e9s du D\u00e9p\u00f4t en 1999, sauf entente contraire entre les parties. L'indemnit\u00e9 sera diminu\u00e9e de 8 % ; L\u2019'indemnit\u00e9 doit tenir compte d'une promotion au rang de caporal apr\u00e8s 7 ans ; Les parties tenteront de s'entendre sur les mesures \u00e0 prendre et le calendrier de mise en oeuvre relativement aux questions pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans la section redressement syst\u00e9mique de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Si les parties sont incapables de s'entendre sur cette partie de l'adjudication dans les trois mois suivant la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal rendra une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive ; L\u2019intim\u00e9e versera 9 000 $ \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 par les actes discriminatoires ; L\u2019'intim\u00e9e versera 12 000 $ \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la Loi ; L\u2019intim\u00e9e versera 9 500 $ \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses qu'il a engag\u00e9es pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes. L'intim\u00e9e indemnisera \u00e9galement M. Tahmourpour pour les frais juridiques engag\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce ; L\u2019intim\u00e9e paiera les int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnit\u00e9s accord\u00e9es en l'esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment aux modalit\u00e9s susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[5] La GRC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de contr\u00f4ler judiciairement la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal et, le 6 octobre 2009, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a annul\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision et a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal afin qu\u2019elle soit entendue par un autre membre (2009 CF 1009). M. Tahmourpour a interjet\u00e9 appel du jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et, le 19 juillet 2010, la Cour d\u2018appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9tabli la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards, sauf en ce qui concerne l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration no (iv), laquelle pr\u00e9voit une indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire pour pertes de salaire futures :\n[L]\u2019appel [est accueilli], exception faite de la question du plafonnement ou de la limite \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire accord\u00e9e dans l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration. [...] les paragraphes 2 et 3 du jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [sont annul\u00e9s] et [sont remplac\u00e9s] par les suivants ;\n2. La demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire n\u2019est accueillie qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la premi\u00e8re phrase de l\u2019alin\u00e9a iv) du paragraphe 267 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne en date du 16 avril 2008, et elle est rejet\u00e9e \u00e0 tous autres \u00e9gards.\n3. L\u2019affaire est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il r\u00e9examine la premi\u00e8re phrase de l\u2019alin\u00e9a iv) du paragraphe 267 conform\u00e9ment aux motifs de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rendue dans le dossier A\u2011453\u201109.\nIII. Extraits tir\u00e9s des proc\u00e9dures ant\u00e9rieures [6] Les extraits suivants tir\u00e9s du jugement de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et de la d\u00e9cision rendue par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en contr\u00f4le judiciaire sont pertinents dans le cadre du r\u00e9examen de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\nLa Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale\n[40] La partie pertinente de l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration est ainsi con\u00e7ue (paragraphe 267 de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal) :\n(iii) l\u2019intim\u00e9e versera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour une indemnit\u00e9 pour le salaire et les avantages sociaux qu\u2019il aurait touch\u00e9s durant les premiers deux ans et douze semaines de travail en tant que policier de la GRC apr\u00e8s l\u2019obtention du dipl\u00f4me au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. L\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sera diminu\u00e9e de 8 %.\n(iv) l\u2019intim\u00e9e paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l\u2019industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l\u2019\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu\u2019il aurait touch\u00e9 en tant que policier de la GRC jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que M. Tahmourpour accepte ou rejette l\u2019offre de r\u00e9admission au programme de formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t. [\u2026]\n[41] Telle que je la comprends, cette partie de l\u2019ordonnance \u00e9tablit deux p\u00e9riodes diff\u00e9rentes pour ce qui est de l\u2019indemnisation p\u00e9cuniaire. La premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode, que les parties appellent parfois p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce, d\u2019une dur\u00e9e de 2 ans et 12 semaines, d\u00e9bute \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle M. Tahmourpour aurait obtenu son dipl\u00f4me du D\u00e9p\u00f4t si son contrat n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9sili\u00e9. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette p\u00e9riode, M. Tahmourpour avait droit \u00e0 un montant \u00e9quivalent au salaire qu\u2019il aurait touch\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019agent de la GRC, moins 8 %.\n[42] La deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode commence tout de suite apr\u00e8s la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce et se termine \u00e0 la date de l\u2019acceptation ou du rejet d\u2019une offre de r\u00e9admission par M. Tahmourpour. Pour cette p\u00e9riode, M. Tahmourpour a droit \u00e0 une autre indemnit\u00e9 que j\u2019appellerai compl\u00e9mentaire, dont le montant \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen vers\u00e9 dans l\u2019industrie au Canada aux personnes de son \u00e2ge pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein et le salaire qu\u2019il aurait touch\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode en tant que policier de la GRC, moins 8 %. (L\u2019ordonnance pr\u00e9voit un ajustement suppl\u00e9mentaire pour tenir compte de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que M. Tahmourpour aurait touch\u00e9 une r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et aurait eu une promotion au cours de la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode, mais il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de s\u2019y arr\u00eater pour les besoins de notre analyse).\n[43] Puisque la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode se termine n\u00e9cessairement apr\u00e8s la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, le 16 avril 2008, il s\u2019ensuit que sa dur\u00e9e serait n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019au moins six ans (de 2002 jusqu\u2019au 16 avril 2008, au moins).\n[44] Le dossier n\u2019indique pas clairement si la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode a pris fin ni \u00e0 quel moment elle pourrait vraisemblablement se terminer. Si l\u2019on interpr\u00e8te de fa\u00e7on litt\u00e9rale cette partie de la r\u00e9paration, la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode pourrait durer ind\u00e9finiment si M. Tahmourpour s\u2019abstient simplement d\u2019accepter ou de rejeter une offre de r\u00e9admission, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019elle ne soit assortie d\u2019une condition portant qu\u2019elle sera r\u00e9put\u00e9e rejet\u00e9e si elle n\u2019est pas accept\u00e9e dans un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9termin\u00e9, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 lors de l\u2019audition de l\u2019appel.\n[45] La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a accept\u00e9 l\u2019argument de la GRC selon lequel l\u2019octroi de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire contrevient au principe de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien causal entre l\u2019acte discriminatoire et la perte (voir Chopra (pr\u00e9cit\u00e9), au paragraphe 37). M. Tahmourpour soutient que l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire est raisonnable et que le juge a erron\u00e9ment tir\u00e9 la conclusion contraire).\n[46] De toute \u00e9vidence, le Tribunal connaissait l\u2019arr\u00eat Chopra et les principes qui y \u00e9taient formul\u00e9s concernant les dommages\u2011int\u00e9r\u00eats. Voici un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des conclusions de fait formul\u00e9es sur ce point par le Tribunal :\nLa discrimination dont la GRC a fait preuve \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Tahmourpour a emp\u00each\u00e9 celui\u2011ci de terminer sa formation au D\u00e9p\u00f4t et de gagner sa vie comme agent de la GRC. Il doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la perte du salaire qu\u2019il aurait touch\u00e9. La probabilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussite des cadets n\u2019appartenant pas \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible \u00e9tant de 93 %, il y a lieu de r\u00e9duire l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 (ce qui justifie une r\u00e9duction de 7 %), et une r\u00e9duction suppl\u00e9mentaire de 1 % s\u2019impose du fait que le taux moyen d\u2019attrition des membres r\u00e9guliers au cours des 20 premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d\u2019emploi est de 1 %. Il n\u2019y a pas lieu de pr\u00e9voir de r\u00e9duction suppl\u00e9mentaire pour tenir compte du fait que les lacunes d\u00e9montr\u00e9es de M. Tahmourpour augmentaient la probabilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9choue, parce qu\u2019il est impossible de savoir dans quelle mesure elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par le traitement discriminatoire. Il s\u2019impose de prendre en compte l\u2019obligation d\u2019att\u00e9nuation des pertes de M. Tahmourpour. Celui\u2011ci ne s\u2019est pas suffisamment efforc\u00e9 d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ses pertes entre le moment o\u00f9 il a quitt\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t et le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. De 2000 \u00e0 2002, toutefois, il lui \u00e9tait difficile de travailler \u00e0 cause des r\u00e9percussions psychologiques de son exp\u00e9rience au D\u00e9p\u00f4t et parce qu\u2019il devait n\u00e9cessairement consacrer du temps \u00e0 sa plainte. C\u2019est pourquoi la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie \u00e0 2 ans et 12 semaines. Apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, toutefois, il aurait pu travailler. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[47] Suivant ma lecture de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas tenu compte d\u2019autres faits pour \u00e9tablir le montant de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 p\u00e9cuniaire. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ne permet pas de d\u00e9terminer pourquoi il a retenu la date du rejet ou de l\u2019acceptation d\u2019une offre de r\u00e9admission comme date de fin de la deuxi\u00e8me p\u00e9riode au lieu d\u2019\u00e9tablir une date ant\u00e9rieure. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion du juge que le Tribunal ne s\u2019est pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 la question du moment auquel la discrimination subie par M. Tahmourpour avait cess\u00e9 d\u2019agir sur sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019occuper un emploi r\u00e9mun\u00e9rateur, apr\u00e8s la fin de la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce. En l\u2019absence d\u2019explication du Tribunal, on ne saurait juger raisonnable la partie de l\u2019ordonnance relative \u00e0 l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[48] Puisque je partage l\u2019avis du juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un motif d\u2019appel, se pose la question de savoir si la r\u00e9paration ordonn\u00e9e par le juge (le renvoi de l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal pour qu\u2019il la r\u00e9entende) doit \u00eatre maintenue. \u00c0 mon avis, la question du plafond ou de la limite \u00e0 \u00e9tablir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire revient au Tribunal. En cons\u00e9quence, je suis d\u2019avis de lui renvoyer l\u2019affaire afin qu\u2019il examine uniquement la question du plafonnement ou de la limitation de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9.\u201d [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nLe contr\u00f4le judiciaire effectu\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale [84] Le demandeur a \u00e9galement soutenu qu\u2019il devrait y avoir une limite d\u2019environ deux ans quant \u00e0 l\u2019indemnisation pour perte de salaire. Le demandeur se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal d\u2019appel de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne et l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Morgan c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes), [1990] D.C.D.P. no 10 (QL); inf. [1992] 2 C.F. 401 (C.A.F.).\n[85] Dans l\u2019affaire Morgan, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que l\u2019on avait refus\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Morgan un poste au sein des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes en raison d\u2019actes discriminatoires exerc\u00e9s par les Forces, par opposition \u00e0 la simple perte d\u2019une occasion d\u2019emploi. La majorit\u00e9 du Tribunal d\u2019appel a conclu que, lorsqu\u2019une ordonnance de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration est prononc\u00e9e, l\u2019indemnisation doit se poursuivre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que l\u2019ordonnance soit respect\u00e9e. La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019a pas souscrit \u00e0 cette conclusion. Elle a estim\u00e9 que le Tribunal d\u2019appel avait commis une erreur en ne fixant pas une limite \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnisation ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9int\u00e9gration. La Cour d\u2019appel a souscrit \u00e0 l\u2019observation du membre minoritaire du Tribunal d\u2019appel selon lequel il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la p\u00e9riode d\u2019indemnisation co\u00efncide avec la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration, peu importe quand elle a lieu , et elle a conclu que la majorit\u00e9 avait commis une erreur en ne fixant pas une limite. \u2026 [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[86] Le membre minoritaire, dont la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, a conclu que les Forces arm\u00e9es auraient d\u00fb raisonnablement pr\u00e9voir que les cons\u00e9quences des actes discriminatoires s\u2019\u00e9tendraient sur une p\u00e9riode d\u2019environ trois ans et demi.\n[87] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal n\u2019a fait aucune analyse quant \u00e0 une p\u00e9riode limite, et il n\u2019a pas non plus effectu\u00e9 quelque analyse que ce soit quant \u00e0 savoir si la p\u00e9riode pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019\u00e9tendre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de sa d\u00e9cision, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue pr\u00e8s de huit ans et demi apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9siliation du contrat de cadet de M Tahmourpour.\n[88] Le Tribunal a commis une erreur en n\u2019effectuant pas cette analyse. Les dommages et int\u00e9r\u00eats pr\u00e9vus par la Loi ne peuvent s\u2019accumuler ind\u00e9finiment et, comme la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l\u2019a mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morgan, [le bon sens impose] qu\u2019il y a une limite \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019auteur du pr\u00e9judice quant aux cons\u00e9quences de son acte [discriminatoire].\n[91] Je conclus que le Tribunal : [\u2026] d) a commis une erreur en accordant une indemnisation pour perte de salaire payable jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration dans le programme de formation sans avoir effectu\u00e9 d\u2019analyse quant \u00e0 savoir si cette p\u00e9riode pouvait raisonnablement s\u2019\u00e9tendre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date de la r\u00e9int\u00e9gration.\nIV. Extraits de la d\u00e9cision du tribunal [7] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 attentivement la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, notamment les extraits suivants :\nFaut-il indemniser M. Tahmourpour pour la perte de salaire due \u00e0 l'occasion perdue de terminer la formation en raison de la conduite discriminatoire de la GRC ?\n[218] Oui. La conduite discriminatoire de la GRC a priv\u00e9 M. Tahmourpour de l'occasion de terminer la formation et de gagner sa vie comme agent de la GRC. Il doit \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 pour la perte du salaire qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9.\nComment faut-il calculer la perte de salaire r\u00e9sultant de l'occasion perdue ?\n\u201c[219] La Cour d'appel a jug\u00e9 que l'approche adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans Chopra, consistant \u00e0 indemniser la perte de salaire tout en tenant compte de toute incertitude quant \u00e0 l'obtention du poste, constituait une mani\u00e8re acceptable d'indemniser pour une chance perdue (Chopra, au paragraphe 43). J'adopterai la m\u00eame approche. \u2026\nPour quelle p\u00e9riode M. Tahmourpour doit-il \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 ?\n[224] M. Tahmourpour a demand\u00e9 qu'on lui paye le salaire et les avantages sociaux perdus de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9troactive, de 1999 jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'\u00e0 sa nomination comme agent de la GRC ou, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision si elle est accompagn\u00e9e d'une autre ordonnance pr\u00e9voyant la compensation des pertes futures au cas o\u00f9 la nomination ne serait pas ordonn\u00e9e.\n[225] D'abord, pour ce qui est du paiement r\u00e9troactif du salaire et des avantages sociaux perdus, la Cour d'appel, dans l'arr\u00eat Chopra, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans l'exercice qu'il fait du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) d'indemniser la victime de la totalit\u00e9 ou de la fraction des pertes de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte discriminatoire, le Tribunal peut bien \u00eatre d'avis que les principes qui sous-tendent la doctrine de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes dans d'autres contextes s'appliquent aussi dans un contexte comme celui-ci. La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 encourager l'efficience \u00e9conomique en exigeant que les personnes qui ont subi des pertes prennent des mesures pour minimiser leur perte, puisqu'il n'est pas dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat public de permettre que des membres de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 maximisent leur perte au d\u00e9triment d'autres personnes, m\u00eame si celles-ci sont responsables de la perte. Aussi un tribunal peut-il, bien qu'il n'y soit pas tenu, appliquer la doctrine de l'att\u00e9nuation des pertes dans l'exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fixer l'indemnit\u00e9 qui devra \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 un plaignant.\n[226] J'estime qu'il convient en l'esp\u00e8ce d'examiner si M. Tahmourpour a pris des mesures pour minimiser ses pertes. La preuve de M. Tahmourpour \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e9tait faible. [\u2026] [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[231] J'estime que M. Tahmourpour n'a pas fait suffisamment d'efforts pour att\u00e9nuer ses pertes de la date o\u00f9 il a quitt\u00e9 le D\u00e9p\u00f4t jusqu'au d\u00e9but de l'audience en ao\u00fbt 2007. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[232] [\u2026] Je ne suis pas convaincue que M. Tahmourpour a r\u00e9ellement tent\u00e9 de se trouver un emploi lucratif qui aurait diminu\u00e9 ses pertes. En fait, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait le faire parce que sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne prenait tout son temps. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[233] Je ne crois pas que travailler \u00e0 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne exigeait de M. Tahmourpour un effort \u00e0 temps plein [\u2026] Par cons\u00e9quent, j'estime qu'il n'est pas raisonnable que M. Tahmourpour n'ait pu travailler du tout (sauf pour vendre une propri\u00e9t\u00e9 et obtenir un contrat de traduction) de janvier 2002 jusqu'\u00e0 aujourd'hui. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[236] La GRC paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le salaire \u00e0 temps plein et les avantages sociaux qu'il aurait re\u00e7us pendant deux ans \u00e0 compter de janvier 2000 [\u2026] En plus, la GRC paiera \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour le salaire et les avantages sociaux qu'il aurait re\u00e7us pour 480 autres heures de travail.\n[237] Sauf pour la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle M. Tahmourpour ne pouvait travailler pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 et pour des raisons li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte, j'estime que M. Tahmourpour aurait pu travailler jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 son argument voulant que le travail exig\u00e9 par sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne l'ait emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler \u00e0 temps plein depuis le moment o\u00f9 il s'est senti suffisamment bien pour travailler jusqu'au d\u00e9but de l'audience, en ao\u00fbt 2007. Les gens prennent toutes sortes de mesures et de moyens pour exercer des activit\u00e9s importantes m\u00eame s'ils travaillent \u00e0 temps plein. M. Tahmourpour aurait pu faire de m\u00eame. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[238] La GRC ne devrait payer que la diff\u00e9rence entre ce que M. Tahmourpour aurait gagn\u00e9 comme employ\u00e9 \u00e0 temps plein et ce qu'il aurait gagn\u00e9 en tant que policier de la GRC, de la date \u00e0 laquelle s'est termin\u00e9e la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce li\u00e9e aux questions de sant\u00e9 et au travail sur la plainte jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision. Par cons\u00e9quent, la GRC doit payer la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l'industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l'\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu'il aurait re\u00e7u en tant que policier de la GRC pour cette p\u00e9riode. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\nFaut-il rendre une ordonnance pour les pertes de salaire futures ?\n[242] Rien ne prouve que l'acte discriminatoire a endommag\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re permanente la capacit\u00e9 de travailler de M. Tahmourpour. [\u2026] [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[243] Par cons\u00e9quent, jusqu'\u00e0 ce que M. Tahmourpour re\u00e7oive une offre lui permettant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le programme de formation, il doit lui \u00eatre vers\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence entre le salaire moyen pour un travail \u00e0 temps plein dans l'industrie au Canada pour les personnes de l'\u00e2ge de M. Tahmourpour et le salaire qu'il aurait re\u00e7u en tant que policier de la GRC jusqu'\u00e0 la date de l'offre de formation. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[244] D\u00e8s qu'elle offre \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour une place en formation, l'obligation de la GRC d'indemniser M. Tahmourpour pour la chance perdue de terminer la formation en 1999 s'\u00e9teint. Aucune autre indemnit\u00e9 ne doit \u00eatre vers\u00e9e \u00e0 ce titre.\nV. R\u00e9examen [8] Les motifs du Tribunal concernant la p\u00e9riode \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de laquelle M. Tahmourpour devrait \u00eatre indemnis\u00e9 comportent un certain nombre de contradictions. Au d\u00e9but, le Tribunal conclut que la GRC devrait verser \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour une indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 compter de la date \u00e0 laquelle s'est termin\u00e9e la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce jusqu'\u00e0 la date de sa d\u00e9cision (voir le paragraphe 238). Le Tribunal conclut ensuite que l\u2019 indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire devrait \u00eatre vers\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la GRC offre une formation \u00e0 M. Tahmourpour (voir le paragraphe 243). Enfin, l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration no (iv) pr\u00e9voit que la GRC verse une indemnit\u00e9 compl\u00e9mentaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que M. Tahmourpour accepte ou rejette l'offre de r\u00e9admission au programme de formation de la GRC.\n[9] Compte tenu des d\u00e9cisions rendues par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Morgan et Chopra, et apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le jugement du Tribunal sur cette question, notamment la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle M. Tahmourpour aurait pu travailler entre la date de l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce et la date de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, compte tenu que rien ne prouve que l'acte discriminatoire a nui de mani\u00e8re permanente \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de travailler de M. Tahmourpour, et compte tenu que M. Tahmourpour ne s\u2019est pas suffisamment efforc\u00e9 d\u2019att\u00e9nuer ses pertes, selon moi, aucun fait, aucun motif et aucun lien de causalit\u00e9 ne justifie l\u2019ordonnance de r\u00e9paration no (iv) et le versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode de gr\u00e2ce de deux ans et douze semaines.\nSign\u00e9e par\nWallace G.

INTRODUCTION [1] Voici les motifs de d\u00e9cision au sujet de la plainte de James Peter Hughes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e contre \u00c9lections Canada (EC). M. Hughes soutient qu'on l'a priv\u00e9 d'un lieu de scrutin accessible, en contravention des alin\u00e9as 5a) et 5b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, telle que modifi\u00e9e (la LCDP), et qu'on a fait preuve de distinction d\u00e9favorable envers lui en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience lorsqu'il est all\u00e9 voter \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil dans la circonscription Toronto Centre, au centreville de Toronto, \u00e0 deux reprises sur une p\u00e9riode de sept mois (pour l'\u00e9lection partielle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du 17 mars 2008 et pour l'\u00e9lection f\u00e9d\u00e9rale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du 14 octobre 2008). Sa plainte porte aussi sur le fait qu'EC n'a pas effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate appropri\u00e9e et n'a pas pris de mesures apr\u00e8s qu'il ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites.\nII. LA PLAINTE [2] M. Hughes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) le 5 juin 2008. Comme la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e quatre mois avant l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du 14 octobre, le formulaire de plainte ne portait que sur l'incident qui a eu lieu lors de l'\u00e9lection partielle du 17 mars. La Commission a fait enqu\u00eate et a renvoy\u00e9 le fond de la plainte au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2008. Entre temps, le deuxi\u00e8me incident, celui de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du 14 octobre, avait eu lieu. Ce deuxi\u00e8me incident et la fa\u00e7on dont EC a trait\u00e9 les deux incidents constituent le sujet dont le Tribunal est saisi. Ni l'une ni l'autre partie n'a remis cela en cause.1\nIII. Les questions pr\u00e9liminaires Non participation de la Commission\n[3] Tr\u00e8s t\u00f4t apr\u00e8s avoir renvoy\u00e9 la plainte, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle participerait \u00e0 l'audience. Une semaine avant l'audience sur le fond, elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu'elle n'y participerait plus ; cependant, elle garde le statut de partie. L'avocat de la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 par \u00e9crit que la Commission participerait \u00e0 l'application de toute mesure de redressement syst\u00e9mique, y compris le contr\u00f4le d'EC, si de telles mesures \u00e9taient accord\u00e9es par le Tribunal.\nRequ\u00eate pour agir en qualit\u00e9 de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e\n[4] Avant l'audience, le Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences (CCD) a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'intervenant ou de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Le plaignant a appuy\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de CCD et EC a accept\u00e9, en pr\u00e9sentant certaines conditions. Le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate. CCD a obtenu la permission de pr\u00e9senter des arguments oraux et \u00e9crits. L'intitul\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence. La participation du CCD \u00e0 l'audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 utile. Le CCD est un organisme multidisciplinaire pancanadien \u00e0 but non lucratif qui couvre une vaste gamme de d\u00e9ficiences. Il a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses causes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne qui ont fait jurisprudence, y compris des causes qui se sont rendues en Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\nIV. LES QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [5] Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, l'avocat d'EC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son client \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 admettre certaines choses au sujet de sa responsabilit\u00e9. Les autres parties ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que d'autres faits, qu'EC n'a pas admis, engagent aussi sa responsabilit\u00e9 et sont d'une nature aggravante et pertinente quant aux mesures de redressement personnelles et syst\u00e9miques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9es. J'examinerai dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs la port\u00e9e de la responsabilit\u00e9 d'EC et les mesures de redressement qui sont appropri\u00e9es.\nV. LA D\u00c9CISION [6] Le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9.\nVI. LISTE DES T\u00c9MOINS Les personnes suivantes ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 :\nM. James Peter Hughes - le plaignant; Professeure Catherine Frazee - experte en droits des personnes handicap\u00e9es et en accessibilit\u00e9; M. Michel Roussel - directeur principal, Gestion et pr\u00e9paration des donn\u00e9es \u00e9lectorales, EC; M. Robert Topping - architecte et expert en accessibilit\u00e9, design universel et am\u00e9nagement \u00e0 acc\u00e8s facile.\nVII. LES FAITS [7] Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint limit\u00e9 des faits. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, au d\u00e9but de l'audience, EC a reconnu certains faits qui, combin\u00e9s, comme EC le reconna\u00eet, engagent sa responsabilit\u00e9 en application de alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP. La reconnaissance de la responsabilit\u00e9 comprenait l'admission de certains faits au sujet du chemin pour se rendre \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2 et de l'entr\u00e9e no 2 ellem\u00eame. EC a accept\u00e9 de ne plus utiliser l'\u00e9glise St. Basil comme lieu de scrutin. Il existe de nombreux lieux tout pr\u00e8s qui sont mieux adapt\u00e9s et qui sont enti\u00e8rement accessibles. Il y a eu quelques d\u00e9saccords au sujet de certains faits. J'expose cidessous mes conclusions de fait, y compris au sujet des faits qui se trouvent dans l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et ceux que EC a reconnus.\n[8] M. James Peter Hughes et son \u00e9pouse ont habit\u00e9 de nombreuses ann\u00e9es aux \u00c9tats Unis. Ils sont revenus au Canada \u00e0 leur retraite. M. Hughes souffre du syndrome postpoliomy\u00e9lite et il utilise une chaise roulante ou une marchette. Ils habitent dans un condo au centreville de Toronto, \u00e0 quelques rues de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil, le lieu de scrutin qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 lors des deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9lectoraux dont il est question en l'esp\u00e8ce. M. Hughes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que l'\u00e9lection partielle de mars 2008 \u00e9tait sa premi\u00e8re exp\u00e9rience depuis de vote dans une \u00e9lection canadienne depuis les ann\u00e9es 1970 quand il habitait au Qu\u00e9bec. Il s'agissait d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement important pour lui. Malheureusement, l'exp\u00e9rience \u00e9lectorale qu'il a v\u00e9cue \u00e9tait loin de ce qu'il attendait.\nLe vote lors de l'\u00e9lection partielle du 17 mars\n[9] Le 17 mars 2008, M. Hughes s'est rendu, \u00e0 l'aide de sa marchette, \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil pour voter. L'\u00e9glise se trouve dans un beau vieil immeuble au centreville de Toronto. Elle poss\u00e8de trois entr\u00e9es : l'entr\u00e9e no 1 (l'entr\u00e9e principale, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 sud), l'entr\u00e9e no 2 (l'entr\u00e9e arri\u00e8re, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 nord) et l'entr\u00e9e no 3 (sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9, du c\u00f4t\u00e9 ouest). J'expliquerai plus en d\u00e9tail ces trois entr\u00e9es plus loin dans mes motifs.\n[10] De la rue, le plaignant a suivi un long chemin sinueux qui grimpait une colline jusqu'\u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 1. \u00c0 la porte d'entr\u00e9e se trouvait [traduction] une rampe pour handicap\u00e9s parfaitement acceptable , selon le plaignant. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il a trouv\u00e9 des affiches d'EC [traduction] jaunes et sibyllines , qui pointaient vers l'entr\u00e9e no 3 plut\u00f4t que vers l'entr\u00e9e no 1. L'entr\u00e9e no 1 \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e. La pr\u00e9sence de ces affiches indique qu'EC (ou du moins le responsable qui a install\u00e9 les affiches) \u00e9tait au courant que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e et ne pouvait donc pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e comme entr\u00e9e accessible pour les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients et non d\u00e9ficients. M. Hughes a contourn\u00e9 l'immeuble pour se rendre \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 3. Lorsqu'il a ouvert la porte, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris d'y trouver un escalier descendant. Ce n'\u00e9tait clairement pas une entr\u00e9e accessible.\n[11] M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de descendre les marches sans aide. Il a cri\u00e9 pour que quelqu'un vienne l'aider et une personne est venue le rejoindre. Cette personne \u00e9tait un responsable d'EC et lui a dit qu'il pouvait soit descendre l'escalier ou se rendre de l'autre c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l'immeuble (\u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2). Il a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'affronter un obstacle connu plut\u00f4t que de risquer de faire face \u00e0 des obstacles inconnus. Le responsable a descendu sa marchette et M. Hughes a ensuite descendu les marches [traduction] sur les fesses . Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s humili\u00e9. Il avait aussi peur de tomber. Ils ont ensuite d\u00e9pli\u00e9 la marchette et il s'est rendu aux bureaux de scrutin de l'\u00e9lection dans le hall du soussol.\n[12] Son exp\u00e9rience quant \u00e0 l'inaccessibilit\u00e9 ne s'est pas termin\u00e9e l\u00e0. Lorsqu'il est arriv\u00e9 dans le hall, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de voter dans l'isoloir parce que les tables \u00e9taient plac\u00e9es trop pr\u00e8s les unes des autres, bloquant ainsi le chemin. Les responsables d'EC ont d\u00fb r\u00e9arranger les tables. Une personne utilisant une marchette ou une chaise roulante n'avait aucun chemin direct pour se rendre \u00e0 l'isoloir.\n[13] Alors qu'il se trouvait dans le hall du soussol de l'\u00e9glise, M. Hughes a racont\u00e9 \u00e0 un responsable masculin d'EC son [traduction] exp\u00e9rience \u00e9lectorale difficile . Il ne se souvient pas du nom du responsable. M. Hughes a affirm\u00e9 que la personne lui a r\u00e9pondu que le manque d'accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait d\u00fb \u00e0 des questions financi\u00e8res et que [traduction] lors d'une \u00e9lection partielle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il n'y a pas suffisamment de fonds pour assurer que le bureau de scrutin sera accessible . M. Hughes \u00e9tait horrifi\u00e9 . EC a affirm\u00e9 que si cela a bel et bien eu lieu, le responsable avait tort et n'\u00e9tait pas en position de faire de tels commentaires. Rien n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait au sujet de sa plainte verbale. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[14] M. Hughes a finalement pu voter ce jourl\u00e0. Cependant, son d\u00e9part a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout aussi difficile. Plut\u00f4t que de remonter \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 3, bourr\u00e9e d'obstacles, les responsables d'EC ont offert d'aider cet \u00e9lecteur d\u00e9ficient \u00e0 quitter par la porte arri\u00e8re, l'entr\u00e9e no 2, qui se trouvait \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 du stationnement. M. Hughes a d\u00fb grimper \u00e0 pied une [traduction] rampe \u00e9troite et abrupte . Il lui \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00e0 peine possible d'utiliser sa marchette. Les deux portes qui menaient au stationnement \u00e9taient ferm\u00e9es. Il n'y avait aucun m\u00e9canisme d'ouverture automatique des portes. M. Topping, qui a effectu\u00e9 une inspection des lieux au nom d'EC et qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage d'expert \u00e0 l'audience, a reconnu qu'il s'agissait de lourdes portes d'acier. Une seule des deux portes pouvait \u00eatre ouverte. M. Hughes a donc d\u00fb replier sa marchette pour sortir. \u00c0 l'ext\u00e9rieur des portes, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 \u00e0 de la neige sur le sol, qui n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e correctement. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la largeur du chemin qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9neig\u00e9 semblait tenir compte de personnes ambulatoires seulement. Le chemin \u00e9tait \u00e0 peine assez large pour les roues de sa marchette et certainement pas assez large pour une personne en chaise roulante. Il y avait une rampe inclin\u00e9e vers le bas. Il a d\u00e9crit cette rampe comme \u00e9tant abrupte et glissante. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes selon lequel il n'aurait pas pu sortir par l'entr\u00e9e no 2 sans aide.\n[15] M. Hughes a d\u00e9crit l'entr\u00e9e \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re de l'\u00e9glise comme une [traduction] entr\u00e9e de chargement ou d'urgence . \u00c0 son avis, c'\u00e9tait humiliant et sans consid\u00e9ration. Il a mentionn\u00e9 que l'utilisation de cette entr\u00e9e n'affirme pas la nature humaine d'une personne, mais donne plut\u00f4t l'impression qu'elle devrait \u00eatre trait\u00e9e comme de la marchandise. J'accepte qu'il s'est senti ainsi. Les avocats ont d\u00e9battu \u00e0 savoir s'il s'agissait d'une entr\u00e9e s\u00e9gr\u00e9g\u00e9e, qui rappelait le sud des \u00c9tatsUnis dans le temps de la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation raciale. Je n'ai tir\u00e9 aucune conclusion \u00e0 ce sujet. Il est \u00e9vident que l'entr\u00e9e arri\u00e8re n'\u00e9tait pas id\u00e9ale, ou m\u00eame acceptable, dans les circonstances. Aucune des trois entr\u00e9es de l'\u00e9glise n'\u00e9tait accessible pour M. Hughes. L'entr\u00e9e no 1 \u00e9tait ferm\u00e9e, l'entr\u00e9e no 2 \u00e9tait pleine d'obstacles (physiques et symboliques) et l'entr\u00e9e no 3 \u00e9tait inaccessible en raison des escaliers.\nLes plaintes de M. Hughes et l'enqu\u00eate d'EC\n[16] En plus de la plainte verbale qu'il a formul\u00e9e le jour de l'\u00e9lection, M. Hughes a envoy\u00e9 une plainte \u00e9crite \u00e0 EC le 20 mars 2008.2 Il a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 cette plainte avec l'aide de son avocat. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 l'attention du directeur des \u00e9lections \u00e0 \u00c9lections Canada \u00e0 Ottawa. Pour une raison inexpliqu\u00e9e, la lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise au mauvais responsable \u00e0 EC. Cette erreur a \u00e9t\u00e9 relev\u00e9e lorsque l'avocat du plaignant a re\u00e7u une r\u00e9ponse le 26 mars de l'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du commissaire aux \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. L'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception de la lettre, mais a expliqu\u00e9 que le sujet de la plainte ne relevait pas de la comp\u00e9tence du commissaire, qui est responsable du respect et de l'application de la Loi \u00e9lectorale du Canada, L.C., 2000, ch. 9, telle que modifi\u00e9e (la LCE). L'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 la lettre \u00e0 la Direction des services juridiques d'EC. M. Hughes a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait d'avis que la lettre qu'on lui a envoy\u00e9e rejetait sa plainte. EC n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d'expliquer la raison pour laquelle la lettre de M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e au mauvais bureau de son administration nationale \u00e0 Ottawa. La lettre avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la bonne personne.\n[17] M. Hughes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'EC n'a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites (sauf pour la lettre de l'avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du commissaire mentionn\u00e9e dans le paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent) jusqu'\u00e0 ce que la Commission re\u00e7oive, le 6 ao\u00fbt 2008, une lettre d'EC. Le 5 juin 2008, M. Hughes avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte en vertu de la LCDP \u00e0 la Commission. La lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt constituait la r\u00e9ponse d'EC \u00e0 la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la LCDP. M. Roussel a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 des responsables d'enqu\u00eater au sujet de la plainte de M. Hughes, mais il ne leur a pas parl\u00e9 directement \u00e0 ce sujet et n'a pas parl\u00e9 personnellement au directeur du scrutin (DS) de la circonscription de Toronto Centre ni \u00e0 d'autres responsables d'EC qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents au bureau de vote de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil.\nLe vote \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du 14 octobre\n[18] Le 14 octobre 2008, les Canadiens ont \u00e9t\u00e9 convi\u00e9s aux urnes dans le cadre d'une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. M. Hughes a re\u00e7u une carte d'information de l'\u00e9lecteur, indiquant que son lieu de scrutin se trouvait une fois de plus \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil. La carte portait m\u00eame le symbole universel d'accessibilit\u00e9. M. Hughes esp\u00e9rait que les choses se d\u00e9rouleraient diff\u00e9remment cette foisci et qu'EC avait tenu compte de sa plainte.\n[19] \u00c0 sa d\u00e9ception, le plaignant soutient qu'il a v\u00e9cu le m\u00eame manque d'accessibilit\u00e9 lors du vote du 14 octobre, \u00e0 l'exception de la neige sur le sol. Lorsqu'il s'est rendu \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil, la porte de devant (l'entr\u00e9e no 1), qui avait une rampe accessible, \u00e9tait une fois de plus verrouill\u00e9e. Cette foisci, il s'est rendu \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2, o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9couvert que l'une des portes \u00e9tait tenue entrouverte par une roche bris\u00e9e. Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'il ne pouvait pas ouvrir la lourde porte d'acier seul. Avec de l'aide, il est entr\u00e9e par la porte no 2, a vot\u00e9 et a quitt\u00e9 l'\u00e9glise de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. M. Hughes soutient qu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9 du fait que, malgr\u00e9 ses plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites \u00e0 EC sept mois plus t\u00f4t et sa plainte de juin 2008 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission, EC n'avait pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me en fournissant des installations \u00e0 acc\u00e8s facile o\u00f9 il pourrait exercer son important droit d\u00e9mocratique de vote. Il croyait qu'au mieux, EC \u00e9tait incomp\u00e9tent, ou qu'au pire, il avait agi de fa\u00e7on volontaire ou malintentionn\u00e9e.\nApr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du 14 octobre\n[20] Apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection, la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 le sujet de la plainte au Tribunal, le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2008. En mars 2009, EC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'architecte et expert en accessibilit\u00e9 Robert Topping d'effectuer une inspection sur les lieux de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil et de faire un rapport sur certains probl\u00e8mes d'accessibilit\u00e9. Le rapport de M. Topping a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en preuve et ce dernier a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience en octobre 2009. Il a soulign\u00e9 certains des probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil du point de vue de la facilit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e8s. En raison de la plainte de M. Hughes, du rapport de M. Topping, de l'inclinaison abrupte et de l'existence d'autres lieux plus appropri\u00e9s dans la r\u00e9gion, avant l'audience, M. Roussel, dans son affidavit, a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'EC n'utiliserait plus l'\u00e9glise St. Basil comme lieu de scrutin, malgr\u00e9 certains de ses [traduction] avantages importants (p. ex., le stationnement, l'utilisation communautaire et l'utilisation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente lors d'une \u00e9lection). En date de l'audience, M. Roussel ne savait pas si un autre lieu avait \u00e9t\u00e9 choisi.\nVII. EC : SA STRUCTURE, SON R\u00d4LE ET SON TRAVAIL EN MATI\u00c8RE D'ACCESSIBILIT\u00c9 [21] La d\u00e9claration de t\u00e9moin de Michel Roussel et son t\u00e9moignage de vive voix ont d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail la structure, le r\u00f4le et le travail d'EC en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9. Au sommet d'EC se trouve le directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral des \u00e9lections du Canada (DGE), qui est un agent du Parlement. Sous le niveau du DGE se trouvent des cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, dont fait partie M. Roussel. Le bureau national d'EC \u00e0 Ottawa est responsable, entre autres, des politiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales et de la formation des responsables des \u00e9lections ainsi que de la supervision des \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9lectoraux f\u00e9d\u00e9raux (\u00e9lections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, \u00e9lections partielles et r\u00e9f\u00e9rendums). Il existe aussi un commissaire aux \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales ind\u00e9pendant qui est responsable du respect de la LCE et qui recommande, si n\u00e9cessaire, la poursuite judiciaire dans les cas de contravention \u00e0 la LCE.\n[22] Le Canada a 308 circonscriptions \u00e9lectorales municipales, aussi connues sous le nom de divisions \u00e9lectorales ou circonscriptions, dont la taille physique et la population varient. La plus grande circonscription est celle du Nunavut (20 % de la masse terrestre du Canada). Par comparaison, la Ville de Toronto comprend 22 circonscriptions. Chaque circonscription a un DS, nomm\u00e9 par le DGE. Le DS est responsable de la pr\u00e9paration et du d\u00e9roulement d'une activit\u00e9 \u00e9lectorale dans sa circonscription et en supervise l'ex\u00e9cution. Sous le DS se trouve un directeur adjoint du scrutin. Ces deux responsables sont des agents permanents et continuent leur travail entre les \u00e9lections. De nombreux employ\u00e9s temporaires \u00e0 temps partiel et \u00e0 temps plein se rapportent \u00e0 eux - le scrutateur, le superviseur de centres de scrutin, les greffiers du scrutin, etc.\n[23] Chaque circonscription a des lieux de scrutin et dans chaque lieu de scrutin se trouvent des bureaux de scrutin. La circonscription de Toronto Centre a 75 lieux de scrutin (St. Basil en fait partie) et 271 bureaux de scrutin. Dans tout le pays, lors de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 2008, il y a eu plus de 20 000 lieux de scrutin, 63 000 bureaux de scrutin et plus de 200 000 responsables temporaires. Cela pr\u00e9sente un d\u00e9fi formidable au niveau de l'organisation et de la logistique pour EC, puisqu'une grande partie du travail ne peut \u00eatre faite, selon la Loi, que lorsque le d\u00e9cret est \u00e9mis et que l'\u00e9lection est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e. Cela comprend l'embauche de la plupart de ces 200 000 employ\u00e9s et la signature des baux pour les lieux de scrutin. Je reconnais qu'une grande partie du travail est effectu\u00e9e aussi avant et apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection. Je tiens compte des restrictions en mati\u00e8re de logistique et de temps auxquelles EC est confront\u00e9e. Les DS et les autres employ\u00e9s sont extr\u00eamement occup\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode d'\u00e9lection de 36 jours.\nExigences d'accessibilit\u00e9\n[24] Le Parlement a pr\u00e9vu des exigences en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 des \u00e9lections dans de nombreux articles de la LCE, y compris au paragraphe 121(1), qui pr\u00e9voit que [l]e bureau de scrutin doit fournir un acc\u00e8s de plainpied . Le terme acc\u00e8s de plainpied n'est pas d\u00e9fini dans la Loi. Dans le guide du SCS d'EC, ce terme est d\u00e9fini comme un acc\u00e8s plat . Des directives, non pr\u00e9vues par la Loi, indiquent que la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour la pente d'une rampe est de 1:12 (une augmentation de 1 po pour chaque 12 po de longueur). Je reconnais que l'acc\u00e8s de plainpied est une souscat\u00e9gorie de l'acc\u00e8s facile. Bien que le manque d'acc\u00e8s de plainpied soit un obstacle majeur, ce n'est en aucun cas le seul obstacle auquel les personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite font face.\n[25] De plus, la LCE n'emp\u00eache pas EC de fournir des accommodements plus importants que le simple acc\u00e8s de plainpied et EC s'est pr\u00e9value de cette possibilit\u00e9, comme le d\u00e9montrent ses politiques, ses directives, ses manuels, son mat\u00e9riel de formation et son site Web, qui pr\u00e9voient des accommodements \u00e0 acc\u00e8s facile qui d\u00e9passent l'acc\u00e8s de plainpied pour les personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite et pour les personnes souffrant de d\u00e9ficiences qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la mobilit\u00e9. La Politique d'EC en mati\u00e8re de libre acc\u00e8s pr\u00e9voit : Les bureaux de scrutin et les autres bureaux dont les directeurs du scrutin doivent assurer l'am\u00e9nagement et l'entretien en vue d'un scrutin doivent \u00eatre faciles d'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 tous \u00e9gards. [soulign\u00e9 dans l'original]. Dans son module sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 de la formation des DS, sur l'une des diapositives PowerPoint, EC explique que l'un des buts de la formation est de pr\u00e9parer les DS afin qu'ils soient en mesure d' assurer un libre acc\u00e8s au processus \u00e9lectoral . Le feuillet de renseignements sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 d'EC pour l'\u00e9glise St. Basil \u00e9num\u00e8re de nombreux crit\u00e8res, y compris des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 autres que l'acc\u00e8s de plainpied , telles que les affiches et le chauffage ad\u00e9quats. M. Roussel a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'EC tient compte de nombreux autres facteurs, en plus de l'acc\u00e8s de plainpied ou de l'acc\u00e8s plat des lieux, lorsqu'il d\u00e9termine le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat des bureaux de scrutin, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 121(1) de la LCE, y compris des facteurs qui, selon moi, portent sur l'acc\u00e8s facile.\n[26] Le Parlement a aussi pr\u00e9vu une exception dans la LEC \u00e0 l'exigence d'acc\u00e8s de plainpied, au paragraphe 121(2). Ce paragraphe \u00e9tablit la proc\u00e9dure par laquelle un DS peut obtenir une exemption \u00e0 l'exigence, \u00e0 condition d'obtenir l'approbation pr\u00e9alable du DGE, s'il est incapable de trouver des lieux \u00e0 acc\u00e8s de plainpied. M. Roussel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que la demande d'une telle exemption se fait en dernier recours et est rare. Toutes les exemptions de ce genre sont d\u00e9clar\u00e9es dans le rapport sur l'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le DGE au Parlement. EC paie plut\u00f4t pour l'installation de rampes temporaires, et, par le pass\u00e9, de rampes permanentes, pour r\u00e9gler les probl\u00e8mes d'obstacles. Lors de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 2008, 122 rampes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9es au Canada, dont le co\u00fbt total \u00e9tait de 127 000 $.\nS\u00e9lection des lieux de scrutin\n[27] Le DS a la responsabilit\u00e9 de s\u00e9lectionner les nombreux lieux de scrutin dans la circonscription. Comme M. Roussel en a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, les DS effectuent des \u00e9valuations sur place au meilleur de leurs capacit\u00e9s. Il existe un registre, ou une base de donn\u00e9es \u00e9lectronique, de plus de 27 000 lieux au Canada. La derni\u00e8re inspection sur place de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite le 20 mai 2002. Le document indique que l'\u00e9glise satisfaisait aux exigences d'acc\u00e8s de plainpied de l'article 121 de la LEC. M. Roussel a aussi soutenu que les DS ne sont pas des architectes ni des \u00e9valuateurs en construction et qu'ils n'ont pas les outils n\u00e9cessaires pour v\u00e9rifier les mesures exactes au sujet de certains crit\u00e8res, tels que la pente d'une rampe. Le t\u00e9moin expert et architecte Robert Topping a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'un profane aurait certainement besoin d'\u00e9quipement sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 et de formation pour pouvoir \u00e9valuer l'accessibilit\u00e9.\n[28] M. Roussel a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les DS se fondent sur les renseignements existants dans la base de donn\u00e9es pour pr\u00e9parer avant l'\u00e9lection leur plan au sujet des lieux de scrutin qui seront utilis\u00e9s. Il soutient qu'en raison des restrictions de temps qui existent lorsqu'une \u00e9lection est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e, les DS n'ont pas le temps d'effectuer une visite sur place de chaque lieu. C'est sans doute pourquoi les DS sont form\u00e9s pour [traduction] s\u00e9lectionner des lieux de scrutins appropri\u00e9s longtemps avant le d\u00e9clenchement de l'\u00e9lection . Dans le manuel du DS, \u00e0 la page 12, un tableau divise les fonctions du DS en colonnes Avant, Pendant, et Apr\u00e8s les scrutins . Dans la colonne Avant , pour la t\u00e2che portant sur les lieux de scrutin, il est \u00e9crit, entre autres : Visiter les bureaux de scrutin potentiels et \u00c9valuer l'accessibilit\u00e9 des emplacements \u00e9ventuels .\n[29] Dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, les DS confirment la disponibilit\u00e9 du lieu avec les locateurs par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone lorsque le d\u00e9cret est \u00e9mis. Les DS devraient peut\u00eatre confirmer avec les locateurs, \u00e0 ce momentl\u00e0, les caract\u00e9ristiques en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 des lieux de scrutin ainsi que leur fonctionnement lors d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement \u00e9lectoral (p. ex. le fait que les entr\u00e9es accessibles seront d\u00e9verrouill\u00e9es).\nAccessibilit\u00e9 : Ce qu'EC a fait en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n[30] Comme le t\u00e9moin expert Robert Topping l'a expliqu\u00e9, de nombreux d\u00e9veloppements technologiques et changements d'attitude au sujet de l'acc\u00e8s facile et de l'accessibilit\u00e9 ont eu lieu depuis les ann\u00e9es 1980. EC a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de nombreux efforts pour garantir un acc\u00e8s facile aux \u00e9lections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment reconnu ce fait dans la d\u00e9cision Association canadienne des parapl\u00e9giques c. \u00c9lections Canada et al., [1992] D.C.D.P. no 2 (ACP) : c'est-\u00e0-dire [...] des mesures positives importantes adopt\u00e9es par \u00c9lections Canada apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection de 1984 [...] , \u00e0 la page 27 et [c]ompte tenu des mesures qu'\u00c9lections Canada a adopt\u00e9es depuis 1984 pour am\u00e9liorer l'accessibilit\u00e9 des bureaux de scrutin [...] \u00e0 la page 28. Cette affaire portait sur neuf plaintes de personnes d\u00e9ficientes qui n'avaient pas pu voter en raison de lieux de scrutin remplis d'obstacles ou avaient vot\u00e9 avec difficult\u00e9 lors de l'\u00e9lection f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de 1984 au Manitoba. Ces plaintes ont motiv\u00e9 EC \u00e0 agir, avant que le Tribunal rende sa d\u00e9cision en 1992. EC a cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 1988, avec l'aide de Barrier-free Design Consultants, le livret Lieux accessibles : Comment rendre le vote plus accessible du manuel DS.\n[31] EC a aussi \u00e9tabli un r\u00e9pertoire national, ou base de donn\u00e9es, de plus de 27 000 lieux accessibles qui ont tous fait l'objet d'une \u00e9valuation des lieux. EC a cr\u00e9\u00e9 une grille d'\u00e9valuation de l'accessibilit\u00e9 pour chaque lieu de scrutin qui doit \u00eatre inscrit au R\u00e9pertoire des installations \u00e9lectorales. Dans le Manuel du DS : Guide pour la tenue des scrutins f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 81 que les DS doivent d\u00e9terminer les domaines qui posent probl\u00e8me de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 prendre \u00c0 L'AVANCE les mesures correctives appropri\u00e9es . De plus, EC a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 partager ses donn\u00e9es recueillies sur les lieux de scrutin avec des groupes internes et externes afin que les renseignements puissent \u00eatre complets et exacts.\n[32] Il existe aussi un Manuel pour les superviseurs de centre de scrutin. Dans les fonctions \u00e0 effectuer avant le jour du scrutin, \u00e0 la page 12, le manuel pr\u00e9cise que les SCS devraient examine[r] la configuration des locaux et signale[r] tout probl\u00e8me . Je sugg\u00e8re qu'EC mentionne pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment les questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 dans cette partie du manuel pour souligner leur importance. EC utilise aussi ce libell\u00e9 dans le Manuel pour les agents r\u00e9viseurs et le Manuel pour les greffiers du scrutin. EC a m\u00eame un Manuel pour le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la formation qui comprend une section sur des trucs ou des le\u00e7ons pour aider un \u00e9lecteur ayant une d\u00e9ficience .\n[33] Je ne saurais passer sous silence l'excellent site Web d'EC. Il comprend beaucoup de renseignements utiles, y compris de nombreux rapports et documents. On y trouve beaucoup de renseignements au sujet de l'accessibilit\u00e9, y compris une section intitul\u00e9e L'accessibilit\u00e9 au syst\u00e8me \u00e9lectoral . Je recommande que, pour faciliter la recherche, EC ajoute un lien sur sa page principale du site Web sous Renseignements pour vous intitul\u00e9 [traduction]\u00c9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients , sous les liens actuels pour les \u00c9lecteurs , Jeunes \u00e9lecteurs et \u00c9lecteurs autochtones .\n[34] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, EC apporte aussi des modifications permanentes ou temporaires aux lieux de scrutin pour fournir un acc\u00e8s de plainpied (p. ex. des rampes). M. Roussel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'EC ne refuse jamais de telles demandes des DS.\n[35] EC fournit aussi une formation pour ses responsables, des DS \u00e0 l'arm\u00e9e de 200 000 employ\u00e9s temporaires qui travaillent le jour de l'\u00e9lection. Il forme aussi les formateurs. Une partie de la formation porte sur des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9.\n[36] EC offre aux personnes d\u00e9ficientes diff\u00e9rents moyens de voter. En plus des exigences en mati\u00e8re d'acc\u00e8s de plainpied aux lieux de scrutin, de lieux de scrutin pour le vote par anticipation, des bureaux des DS et des bureaux de r\u00e9vision, EC fournit diff\u00e9rents moyens de voter. Par exemple, un certificat de transfert peut \u00eatre \u00e9mis pour voter \u00e0 un bureau de scrutin accessible qui se trouve \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 si le bureau de scrutin local n'est pas accessible. De plus, des dispositions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour que des responsables d'EC se pr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 la maison d'un \u00e9lecteur d\u00e9ficient pour lui permettre de voter. Des bulletins de vote sp\u00e9ciaux, y compris les bulletins de vote par la poste, peuvent aussi \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s.\nCe qu'EC a fait depuis que M. Hughes a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en vertu de la LCDP?\n[37] M. Roussel soutient qu'EC a tir\u00e9 beaucoup de le\u00e7ons de l'exp\u00e9rience de vote n\u00e9gative de M. Hughes lors de l'\u00e9lection partielle et de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 2008 et qu'EC s'est am\u00e9lior\u00e9. Par exemple, EC a chang\u00e9 ses affiches jaunes pour agrandir les lettres et y a ajout\u00e9 le symbole universel d'accessibilit\u00e9. L'avocat du plaignant soutient que cela aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre fait plus t\u00f4t, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision ACP de 1992.\n[38] L'avocat d'EC souligne aussi que son client a reconnu sa responsabilit\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l'audience. Cependant, l'avocat du plaignant r\u00e9plique que, compte tenu des faits en l'esp\u00e8ce, ces admissions sont venues trop tard. Peu importe le d\u00e9lai, les admissions ont permis d'\u00e9conomiser du temps \u00e0 l'audience et ont facilit\u00e9 l'atmosph\u00e8re de coop\u00e9ration entre les parties lors de l'audience.\n[39] Par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Roussel et par les observations de son avocat, EC a accept\u00e9 plusieurs demandes de redressement du demandeur, en tout ou en partie. Ces redressements seront pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans la section sur le redressement des pr\u00e9sents motifs de d\u00e9cision.\nIX. L'IMPORTANCE DES \u00c9LECTIONS [40] Le droit de vote est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, \u00e0 l'article 3. Il s'agit d'un droit, et j'ajouterais m\u00eame, d'une responsabilit\u00e9 ou d'un devoir des citoyens du pays. L'\u00c9tat a le devoir l\u00e9gal d'assurer que tous les obstacles, autant que possible, soient enlev\u00e9s pour que les citoyens puissent voter. Cela est d'autant plus important pour les personnes d\u00e9ficientes. La professeure Frazee a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 avec \u00e9loquence les obstacles auxquels les personnes d\u00e9ficientes font face dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9, du point de vue de la structure et de l'attitude, y compris les subtilit\u00e9s des d\u00e9savantages de la d\u00e9ficience. Elle pr\u00e9cise le contexte en fonction de ce qui affecterait une personne d\u00e9ficiente qui tente de voter, notamment, les r\u00e9percussions sur les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients qui se rendent \u00e0 des installations [traduction] s\u00e9par\u00e9es mais \u00e9gales pour exercer leur droit ou \u00e0 des installations dont seule la porte arri\u00e8re leur est accessible. Il ne devrait exister aucune hi\u00e9rarchie de la citoyennet\u00e9 en ce qui a trait au vote au Canada, aucun \u00e9lecteur de seconde classe. Le t\u00e9moignage d'expert de la professeure Frazee et le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 les r\u00e9percussions dommageables sur les personnes d\u00e9ficientes qui quittent le lieu de scrutin en croyant que leur pr\u00e9sence \u00e9tait, au mieux, impr\u00e9vue et, au pire, importune.\n[41] Je note aussi la preuve tir\u00e9e du rapport de 2006 de Statistique Canada qui fait \u00e9tat du nombre de personnes atteintes de diverses d\u00e9ficiences au Canada : 4,4 millions de Canadiens ont une limitation d'activit\u00e9s, ce qui signifie un taux de d\u00e9ficience de 14,3 %. Encore plus criante est l'augmentation de la d\u00e9mographie des Canadiens qui atteignent le statut de [traduction] personne du troisi\u00e8me \u00e2ge et l'augmentation connexe des personnes d\u00e9ficientes au Canada, y compris des personnes \u00e0 mobilit\u00e9 r\u00e9duite.\nX. DISPOSITIONS L\u00c9GISLATIVES [42] La plainte de M. Hughes porte sur la violation des alin\u00e9as 5a) et 5b) de la LCDP :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d'installations ou de moyens d'h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\nd'en priver un individu; de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l'occasion de leur fourniture.\nXI. LE statut unique des lois portant sur les droits de la personne [43] Pas plus tard qu'en 2005, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Chambre des communes) c. Vaid3, au paragraphe 81 : [...] la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne est un texte quasi constitutionnel, qui commande que toute exception \u00e0 son application soit \u00e9nonc\u00e9e clairement.\n[44] Dans Conseil des Canadiens avec d\u00e9ficiences c. VIA Rail4, la Cour supr\u00eame a expliqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 115 :\nDans l'arr\u00eat Winnipeg School Division5, le juge McIntyre a confirm\u00e9 que, en cas de conflit entre une loi sur les droits de la personne et une autre loi particuli\u00e8re, la loi sur les droits de la personne, en tant qu'\u00e9nonc\u00e9 collectif d'une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, doit pr\u00e9valoir \u00e0 moins qu'une exception ne soit cr\u00e9\u00e9e. Il s'ensuit naturellement que, lorsqu'une disposition l\u00e9gislative est susceptible de plus d'une interpr\u00e9tation, elle doit \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux principes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. L'Office est donc tenu d'appliquer les principes de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6, lorsqu'il d\u00e9finit et rel\u00e8ve des obstacles abusifs dans le contexte du transport.\nXII. Les principes l\u00e9gaux portant sur la responsabilit\u00e9 [45] Dans le cadre de plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en vertu de la LCDP, il incombe d'abord au plaignant ou \u00e0 la Commission d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'intim\u00e9 : Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28. Une fois cela \u00e9tabli, c'est \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9 qu'il incombe d'\u00e9tablir une justification ou une explication de l'acte discriminatoire. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en compte dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination : Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204, au paragraphe 22.\n[46] Les cours et les tribunaux ont conclu que la discrimination peut \u00eatre, mais n'est pas toujours, intentionnelle.6 Il faut aussi tenir compte des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives ou de l'effet d'un acte neutre \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue et de politiques neutres \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue sur un individu ou un groupe d'individus en ce qui a trait aux motifs de discrimination illicite.\n[47] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination avec des preuves directes. La discrimination est souvent pratiqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s subtile et cach\u00e9e. La discrimination ouverte est rare : Basi c. Chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (no 1) (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 5038. En fait, le Tribunal a la t\u00e2che de tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s'il existe, comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit dans l'affaire Basi, de subtiles odeurs de discrimination .\n[48] La norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination est la norme civile habituelle, \u00e0 savoir la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Selon cette norme, on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible : Premakumar c. Air Canada (No 2) (2002), 42 C.H.R.R. D\/63 (T.C.D.P.), au paragraphe 81.\nXIII. Les principes l\u00e9gaux portant sur le redressement [49] La partie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale portant sur le redressement de la LCDP se trouve \u00e0 l'article 53. Les paragraphes 53(1) \u00e0 53(4) pr\u00e9cisent les indemnit\u00e9s et les ordonnances discr\u00e9tionnaires que le Tribunal peut rendre contre un intim\u00e9 lorsqu'il est conclu que la plainte est fond\u00e9e. On y trouve l'ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire, l'indemnisation jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ pour la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral, l'indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale jusqu'\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ pour les pertes encourues en raison d'un acte d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 de la part de l'intim\u00e9, ainsi que l'indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l'acte, sauf pour les frais juridiques et les d\u00e9penses encourues lors de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.7 Le Tribunal peut aussi ordonner la prise de mesures de redressement pour corriger l'acte discriminatoire ou pour emp\u00eacher que le m\u00eame acte ou des actes semblables soient pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'avenir.\n[50] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a donn\u00e9 aux tribunaux des droits de la personne une certaine latitude dans la prise d'ordonnances de redressement.8 Cela correspond aux objectifs et aux buts des lois interdisant la discrimination. Bien entendu, les ordonnances de redressement doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9es9 au litige ou au sujet de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e fond\u00e9e : le cadre de la plainte ou le sujet r\u00e9el .10 Le redressement doit \u00eatre \u00e9gal \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire. Les ordonnances doivent aussi \u00eatre raisonnables11 et le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en mati\u00e8re de redressement doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 en fonction de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.12\n[51] Les ordonnances de redressement peuvent aussi comprendre la participation de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ou d'autres parties en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la consultation ou \u00e0 la nomination d'un contr\u00f4leur pour l'application de l'ordonnance.13 La participation d'autres acteurs d\u00e9montre que les cours et les tribunaux ont un r\u00f4le juridictionnel et que le processus officiel se traduit mal dans les aspects techniques ou sp\u00e9cifiques de l'application d'une ordonnance, qui affecte souvent le fonctionnement au jour le jour d'un gouvernement intim\u00e9 ou d'une entreprise intim\u00e9e.\nXIV. Analyse Alin\u00e9as 5a) et 5b) de la LCDP\n[52] Le plaignant et le CCD soutiennent que les deux alin\u00e9as de l'article 5 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 viol\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce. EC soutient que l'affaire porte sur l'alin\u00e9a 5b) et que le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 traiter de l'alin\u00e9a 5a). Je conclus qu'il y a eu contravention aux deux alin\u00e9as en cause.\n[53] Premi\u00e8rement, je suis convaincu qu'EC fournit un service et une installation destin\u00e9s au public au sens de l'article 5. Il ne s'agit pas simplement de l'espace physique dans lequel on vote. EC fournit un service public - qui est primordial - par lequel il fournit le moyen au public d'exercer son droit de vote. Le service comprend le fait de fournir des renseignements publics, des lieux de scrutin et des bureaux de scrutin \u00e0 acc\u00e8s facile, une interaction polie de ses responsables avec les \u00e9lecteurs et la facilitation du vote accessible pour tous, y compris pour les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients.\n[54] Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de applique le raisonnement de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l'arr\u00eat Watkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral)14, qui est l'affaire la plus r\u00e9cente portant sur les services au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP. Cette affaire portait sur une plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e contre Sant\u00e9 Canada et dans laquelle on soutenait qu'il y avait eu discrimination dans la r\u00e9glementation des produits \u00e0 base d'herbes m\u00e9dicinales en raison de l'origine ethnique. La Cour a conclu que les actes d'ex\u00e9cution de Sant\u00e9 Canada ne constituaient pas un service au sens de l'article 5. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que tous les actes gouvernementaux ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement des services au sens de la LCDP. Au paragraphe 28, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : Les pouvoirs publics peuvent fournir des services pour s'acquitter des fonctions que la loi leur confie. Elle a ensuite \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 plusieurs exemples de services fournis par les minist\u00e8res et les organismes gouvernementaux. La tenue des \u00e9lections par EC pourrait facilement se trouver dans cette liste. Au paragraphe 31, la Cour ajoute : [...] je suis d'accord pour dire que, comme les mesures du gouvernement sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement prises au profit du public, l'exigence pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l'article 5, suivant laquelle elles doivent \u00eatre destin\u00e9es au public est habituellement satisfaite dans les affaires mettant en cause une discrimination attribuable \u00e0 des mesures prises par le gouvernement [...]\n[55] En l'esp\u00e8ce, diverses conclusions de responsabilit\u00e9 rel\u00e8vent de l'un ou l'autre, ou des deux alin\u00e9as susmentionn\u00e9s. Le fait que M. Hughes a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de voter ne prot\u00e8ge pas EC de l'alin\u00e9a 5a) : priver un individu [d'un bien, d'un service ou d'une installation destin\u00e9s au public] , c'est\u00e0dire le fait qu'il a d\u00fb descendre les escaliers [traduction] sur les fesses et qu'il a eu besoin d'aide pour entrer et sortir de l'immeuble.\nResponsabilit\u00e9 d'EC\n[56] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, EC n'a reconnu au d\u00e9but de l'audience que sa responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP. Le plaignant et CCD soutiennent qu'EC est aussi responsable en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 5a). EC soutient que sa responsabilit\u00e9 est fond\u00e9e sur l'effet combin\u00e9 de divers points :\nle long sentier inclin\u00e9 menant \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2; les affiches insuffisantes menant \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2; l'inclinaison pour se rendre \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2 \u00e9tait de 1:8,8 (ou de 11,4 %), qui est beaucoup plus abrupte que la norme de 1:12 (ou 8,25 %) \u00e9tablie dans le livret sur les lieux accessibles de EC; les portes de l'entr\u00e9e no 2 \u00e9taient lourdes et s'ouvraient difficilement; une seule porte \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2 pouvait s'ouvrir de l'ext\u00e9rieur; comme il n'y avait qu'une seule porte ouverte, l'entr\u00e9e no 2 \u00e9tait trop \u00e9troite pour qu'une chaise roulante puisse passer;\nil s'agit d'un lieu de scrutin au centreville de Toronto. De meilleurs lieux existent.\nPendant ses observations orales, l'avocat d'EC a mentionn\u00e9 quelques faits de plus au sujet de la responsabilit\u00e9 :\nla porte de l'entr\u00e9e no 2 \u00e9tait bloqu\u00e9e le jour de l'\u00e9lection partielle; la neige n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enlev\u00e9e sur la pente; la rampe \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur de l'\u00e9glise \u00e9tait inad\u00e9quate; il y avait une marche \u00e0 descendre et aucune main courante lors des deux \u00e9lections; l'espace entre les tables des isoloirs \u00e9tait inad\u00e9quat lors des deux \u00e9lections; EC accepte la description de M. Hughes de l'humiliation qu'il a ressentie et son t\u00e9moignage en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, mais n'accepte pas ce qu'il a qualifi\u00e9 de [traduction] s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation .\nL'avocat du plaignant et CCD soulignent qu'aucune des admissions cidessus, dans les points 1 \u00e0 12, n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans l'expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits ou avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience.\n[57] Je suis d'accord avec M. Hughes que la lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt ne r\u00e9pondait pas \u00e0 sa plainte. Pour l'essentiel, cette lettre expliquait que :\nl'\u00e9glise St. Basil offrait un acc\u00e8s de plain-pied tel que requis par le paragraphe 121(1) de la LCE. Comme nous le savons maintenant, ce n'\u00e9tait pas le cas, puisque l'entr\u00e9e no 1 \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e; EC a men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate [traduction] approfondie au sujet de la plainte de M. Hughes, notamment en questionnant les responsables de l'\u00e9lection et en effectuant une inspection des lieux de scrutin. La lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt contient de nombreuses erreurs de fait, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 des conclusions erron\u00e9es; [traduction] [l'\u00e9glise St. Basil] a trois portes d'entr\u00e9e qui \u00e9taient d\u00e9verrouill\u00e9es lors des heures de vote, dont deux offrent un acc\u00e8s de plain-pied. . Une fois de plus, seule l'entr\u00e9e no 1 offre un acc\u00e8s facile, et elle \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e; M. Hughes n'a pas vu les affiches. EC n'a pas t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 au DS ou \u00e0 un autre responsable d'EC qui \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil ce jourl\u00e0 pour qu'il t\u00e9moigne, et n'a pas inclus de preuve dans le rapport d'enqu\u00eate. J'ai le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes au sujet des affiches et je l'accepte; tous les efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour que les rampes soient d\u00e9neig\u00e9es lors des jours de vote par anticipation et de vote pour l'\u00e9lection partielle. J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage contraire de M. Hughes, selon lequel les efforts \u00e9taient insuffisants; [traduction] d'autres \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients ont utilis\u00e9 ces acc\u00e8s de plain-pied [les entr\u00e9es] sans difficult\u00e9 [...] ; l'\u00e9glise St. Basil a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9e lors des \u00e9lections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales de 2004 et de 2006 et EC n'a aucune trace de toute autre plainte en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 au sujet du lieu de scrutin. Bien entendu, il n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement possible de savoir si une plainte en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, puisque M. Roussel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'EC n'a pas de syst\u00e8me pour l'enregistrement de telles plaintes; aucun des responsables interrog\u00e9s ne se souvenait du commentaire du responsable \u00e0 qui M. Hughes a parl\u00e9, commentaire portant sur le manque de fonds pour l'accessibilit\u00e9 lors d'\u00e9lections partielles. En effet, il n'y a eu aucune mention de la plainte verbale de M. Hughes ce jourl\u00e0. Comme je l'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, j'accepte la version de M. Hughes de cette situation.\n[58] M. Hughes a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s boulevers\u00e9 par la lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt d'EC. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la r\u00e9ponse d'EC, ou, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, l'absence de r\u00e9ponse, l'avait boulevers\u00e9 autant que ses exp\u00e9riences de vote frustrantes. Il a soutenu que la lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt \u00e9tait m\u00e9prisante et laissait entendre qu'il \u00e9tait incomp\u00e9tent ou incapable de lire des affiches : [traduction] La lettre \u00e9tait un d\u00e9ni total de mon exp\u00e9rience . Je reconnais que le ton de la lettre est quelque peu m\u00e9prisant. Par contre, de fa\u00e7on plus importante, une grande partie des \u00e9nonc\u00e9s de faits qui s'y trouvent sont clairement fautifs : en particulier, le fait que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 (la seule des trois entr\u00e9es qui \u00e9tait accessible) aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 ouverte le jour de l'\u00e9lection partielle. Je trouve difficile d'accepter qu'apr\u00e8s avoir questionn\u00e9 ces responsables qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil et apr\u00e8s avoir enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur la question, EC croyait que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 avait pu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e le jour de l'\u00e9lection partielle. Cela donne \u00e0 penser que, malgr\u00e9 les affiches qui pointaient \u00e0 l'oppos\u00e9 de l'entr\u00e9e no 1, personne n'avait avis\u00e9 l'enqu\u00eateur d'EC que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 verrouill\u00e9e ce jourl\u00e0. La preuve ne me permet pas de d\u00e9terminer si EC, lors de son enqu\u00eate, a communiqu\u00e9 avec les responsables de l'\u00e9glise pour v\u00e9rifier quelles entr\u00e9es \u00e9taient d\u00e9verrouill\u00e9es ce jourl\u00e0. \u00c0 tout le moins, l'enqu\u00eate d'EC \u00e9tait vici\u00e9e.\n[59] Je conclus que les aspects suivants engagent la responsabilit\u00e9 d'EC en l'esp\u00e8ce :\n1. EC n'a pas offert au plaignant un acc\u00e8s facile au vote, tant pour l'\u00e9lection partielle que pour l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 2008, parce qu'aucune entr\u00e9e n'\u00e9tait accessible pour une personne atteinte de la d\u00e9ficience de M. Hughes;\n2. EC a priv\u00e9 le plaignant d'un service et a fait preuve de distinction d\u00e9favorable contre lui dans l'enqu\u00eate inf\u00e9rieure aux normes qu'il a effectu\u00e9e au sujet des plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites du plaignant. EC n'a m\u00eame pas pris en note sa plainte verbale relative \u00e0 l'\u00e9lection du 17 mars. La r\u00e9ponse d'EC \u00e0 sa plainte \u00e9crite et \u00e0 sa plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la LCDP \u00e9tait tardive et inexacte, et son ton \u00e9tait m\u00e9prisant. Il est d\u00e9cevant que dans sa lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt \u00e0 la Commission, traitant de la plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la LCDP (cinq mois apr\u00e8s les plaintes du plaignant \u00e0 EC), EC ait fait autant d'erreurs factuelles. La plus scandaleuse de ces erreurs \u00e9tait le fait qu'EC a affirm\u00e9 que les trois entr\u00e9es [traduction] \u00e9taient d\u00e9verrouill\u00e9es pendant les heures de vote . Malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'EC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans sa lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt qu'au cours de son examen de la plainte, [traduction] les responsables de l'\u00e9lection ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9s et une inspection des lieux de scrutin a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e , personne \u00e0 l'administration centrale d'EC \u00e0 Ottawa n'a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que la seule entr\u00e9e accessible (la porte principale no 1) \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e le jour de l'\u00e9lection, jusqu'en novembre 2008, auquel moment l'enqu\u00eate s'est termin\u00e9e, selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Roussel. Cependant, la lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt indique que l'enqu\u00eate d'EC \u00e9tait alors termin\u00e9e. Si EC avait effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate s\u00e9rieuse plus t\u00f4t, ce fait aurait certainement \u00e9t\u00e9 remarqu\u00e9 et rectifi\u00e9 \u00e0 temps pour l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'octobre 2008, soit par la communication \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil pour v\u00e9rifier que la porte soit d\u00e9verrouill\u00e9e le jour de l'\u00e9lection ou par la location d'un autre immeuble (accessible). J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes selon lequel le fait qu'EC a mal trait\u00e9 ses plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites ainsi que sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission, y compris le ton et le contenu de la lettre du 6 ao\u00fbt, l'ont boulevers\u00e9 autant, sinon plus, que les deux situations de vote elles-m\u00eames.\n[60] Compte tenu de la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, je suis convaincu que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie et que l'intim\u00e9 n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune explication, d\u00e9fense ou exemption raisonnable en ce qui a trait aux faits additionnels qui ont entra\u00een\u00e9 une responsabilit\u00e9 qu'EC n'a pas reconnue. L'intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] des erreurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises et qu'il avait tir\u00e9 des le\u00e7ons de ces incidents.\nXV. LES MESURES DE REDRESSEMENT [61] Comme j'ai conclu \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 d'EC, je me pencherai maintenant sur la question des mesures de redressement, question qui a occup\u00e9 une grande partie de l'audience.\nIndemnit\u00e9 et int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[62] Le plaignant a demand\u00e9 10 000 $ en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP \u00e0 titre d'indemnit\u00e9 pour le pr\u00e9judice moral dont il a souffert, plus int\u00e9r\u00eats. L'avocat du demandeur a cit\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision que j'ai rendue alors que j'\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sident de la Commission d'enqu\u00eate de l'Ontario sur les droits de la personne, dans une affaire portant sur le d\u00e9ni du droit \u00e0 l'\u00e9galit\u00e9 de traitement et sur les services \u00e0 des personnes d\u00e9ficientes qui tentaient d'aller au cin\u00e9ma. Dans cette affaire, Turnbull, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, j'ai accord\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 pour les pertes entra\u00een\u00e9es par la violation des droits des plaignants, indemnit\u00e9s qui ont vari\u00e9 de 8 000 $ \u00e0 10 000 $. L'avocat du plaignant soutient que le droit de vote est aussi important, sinon plus, que celui d'aller au cin\u00e9ma. De plus, M. Hughes a d\u00fb subir cet affront deux fois. L'avocat d'EC sugg\u00e8re qu'il serait plus appropri\u00e9 d'accorder entre 2 500 $ et 5 000 $. J'accorde \u00e0 M. Hughes 10 000 $ en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e). Les points suivants sont pertinents :\nle droit de vote est l'un des droits les plus sacr\u00e9s du citoyen, et cela comprend le droit de voter dans un contexte accessible; la contravention aux droits de M. Hughes a eu lieu lors de deux \u00e9lections distinctes sur une p\u00e9riode de sept mois; EC a aussi contrevenu au droit de M. Hughes \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate s\u00e9rieuse et prompte ainsi qu'au traitement de ses plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites.\n[63] J'accorde aussi des int\u00e9r\u00eats pour le montant susmentionn\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et au paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP.\nMesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques\n[64] L'avocat du plaignant et CCD m'encouragent \u00e0 ordonner des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques importantes. Ils sont d'avis que de nombreuses erreurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commises par plus d'un individu, que les erreurs visaient le syst\u00e8me complet et qu'il ne s'agissait pas d'une simple erreur isol\u00e9e.\n[65] EC n'est pas d'avis qu'il y a un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique en l'esp\u00e8ce et, par cons\u00e9quent, soutient qu'aucune ordonnance du genre ne devrait \u00eatre rendue. Compte tenu des excuses qu'EC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Hughes lors de l'audience, dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Roussel, ainsi que de sa promesse de ne plus utiliser l'\u00e9glise St. Basil, une telle ordonnance, d'apr\u00e8s EC, n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire.\n[66] L'avocat d'EC a aussi mentionn\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de courriels entre avocats, dans laquelle l'avocat de la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 qu'il ne croyait pas que [traduction] le dossier donne lieu \u00e0 des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques . Il a aussi \u00e9crit que, peu importe, la Commission serait pr\u00eate \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler toute mesure de redressement syst\u00e9mique ordonn\u00e9e par le Tribunal : [traduction] La Commission participera toujours \u00e0 des mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques, en particulier si le Tribunal nous demande d'y participer . J'appr\u00e9cie la volont\u00e9 de la Commission de contr\u00f4ler toute mesure de redressement que je pourrait ordonner.\n[67] Je tiens \u00e0 ajouter qu'EC, dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Roussel et dans les conclusions finales de son avocat, a consenti, en tout ou en partie, \u00e0 de nombreuses ordonnances syst\u00e9miques [traduction] de pratiques futures que le plaignant et CCD ont demand\u00e9es.15 Je reconnais la franchise et l'approche coop\u00e9rative dont EC a fait preuve au sujet de la question du redressement.\n[68] Les conclusions que j'ai tir\u00e9es indiquent clairement un probl\u00e8me syst\u00e9mique. L'\u00e9change suivant a eu lieu lors des conclusions finales, entre l'avocat d'EC et moim\u00eame :\n[traduction]\nAVOCAT : Mais il ne s'agit pas d'un cas o\u00f9 quelque chose est arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 cause du syst\u00e8me. Il s'agit d'un cas o\u00f9 quelque chose est arriv\u00e9 en raison de personnes qui n'ont pas fait tout \u00e0 fait les bonnes choses dans le syst\u00e8me.\nTRIBUNAL : Mais cela fait partie du syst\u00e8me aussi. Le syst\u00e8me est fait de personnes.\nAVOCAT : C'est vrai... Nous voyions \u00e7a, au fond, comme un cas d'erreur humaine.\nDans le cas d'EC, le syst\u00e8me est une large pyramide , de l'\u00e9chelon du haut (le DGE et la gestion \u00e0 Ottawa) jusqu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9chelon du bas, soit les 200 000 responsables actifs le jour de l'\u00e9lection. Il n'y a aucune divisibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 EC : l'entit\u00e9 gouvernementale est responsable des actions de tous ses responsables et employ\u00e9s, qu'ils soient \u00e0 temps plein ou \u00e0 temps partiel, permanents ou temporaires, qui agissent en cours d'emploi.16 La d\u00e9claration d'EC selon laquelle l'\u00e9glise St. Basil ne sera plus utilis\u00e9e comme lieu de scrutin n'est pas une mesure de redressement suffisante pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire dont je suis saisi ou n'emp\u00eachera pas que cet acte se reproduise, suivant l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la LCDP.\n[69] Je tiens compte de l'importance du fait que les cours et les tribunaux doivent \u00eatre sensibles \u00e0 leur r\u00f4le d'arbitre judiciaire et quasi judiciaire, respectivement. En particulier, du fait qu'il faut s'abstenir d'usurper les fonctions des autres branches du gouvernement : Doucet-Boudreau c. Nouvelle\u00c9cosse (Ministre de l'\u00c9ducation), [2003] 3 S.C.R. 3, au paragraphe 6. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a aussi not\u00e9 que : [l]e r\u00f4le des tribunaux varie en fonction du droit en cause et du contexte de chaque affaire .17 Mon ordonnance vise \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes discriminatoires semblables dans l'avenir, tout en respectant le mandat que le Parlement du Canada a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9.\n[70] J'ai mentionn\u00e9 qu'en pr\u00e9parant ces mesures de r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9miques, je tenterais d'atteindre un \u00e9quilibre juste - ni exag\u00e9r\u00e9 ni insuffisant . Il s'agit d'un art et non d'une science. L'avocat d'EC m'a demand\u00e9 de ne pas [traduction] utiliser la m\u00e9thode forte des mesures de redressement au premier tour . Le plaignant et CCD ont soutenu qu'il s'agissait plut\u00f4t du troisi\u00e8me tour - l'affaire ACP en 1992, qui comporte de nombreuses similitudes frappantes avec la plainte de M. Hughes, et les deux \u00e9v\u00e9nements dans le cas de M. Hughes. Je suis d'accord. Cependant, EC a fait de nombreux progr\u00e8s en mati\u00e8re de vote accessible avant (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de 1988) et apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision ACP de 1992. N\u00e9anmoins, il est d\u00e9cevant qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque o\u00f9 les droits en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9ficience et d'accessibilit\u00e9 sont si vivement d\u00e9fendus, alors que nous entrons dans la deuxi\u00e8me d\u00e9cennie du 21e si\u00e8cle, M. Hughes ait \u00e0 vivre l'humiliation et la honte de ces deux exp\u00e9riences de vote, sur une p\u00e9riode de sept mois, suivis par une enqu\u00eate tardive, des conclusions inexactes et le mauvais traitement de ses plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites. Il convient particuli\u00e8rement de noter que, suite aux plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites de M. Hughes au sujet de l'incident lors de l'\u00e9lection partielle, EC n'a pas am\u00e9lior\u00e9 l'accessibilit\u00e9 du lieu de scrutin pour l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale qui a eu lieu sept mois plus tard. Donc, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'EC a pris de nombreuses bonnes mesures au sujet de l'accessibilit\u00e9, les d\u00e9fauts mentionn\u00e9s en l'esp\u00e8ce donnent \u00e0 penser qu'il reste du chemin \u00e0 faire, ce qui justifie une ordonnance pour des pratiques futures .\n[71] Pour atteindre un \u00e9quilibre appropri\u00e9 lors de la d\u00e9termination de la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, il faut se demander : quel \u00e9tait l'acte discriminatoire, quelle en \u00e9tait la gravit\u00e9, quelle en \u00e9tait la source et comment peutil \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9? Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le probl\u00e8me n'est pas tellement les normes ou les politiques en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9, ou la formation d'EC \u00e0 ce sujet. Elles peuvent s\u00fbrement \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9es, mises \u00e0 jour, etc. EC a indiqu\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 d'effectuer ces am\u00e9liorations et de demander la participation des autres parties, et c'est tout \u00e0 son honneur. Le probl\u00e8me est plut\u00f4t dans la nature des politiques et des directives, et dans le fait que la formation n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie ou appliqu\u00e9e par les responsables d'EC. Il y a aussi un probl\u00e8me marqu\u00e9 dans le m\u00e9canisme interne d'EC en ce qui a trait au traitement des plaintes portant sur des obstacles \u00e0 l'acc\u00e8s des personnes d\u00e9ficientes lors d'un vote.\n[72] Je conclus aussi qu'il y a un manque de communication des renseignements entre le [traduction] personnel sur le terrain - les responsables au lieu de scrutin de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil - et le DS de Toronto Centre, entre le DS et l'administration centrale d'EC \u00e0 Ottawa et entre diverses parties de l'administration centrale (le bureau du commissaire, la Direction des services juridiques d'EC, etc.). L'exemple le plus criant est la conclusion inexacte d'EC, apr\u00e8s un examen approfondi de la question, que toutes les entr\u00e9es \u00e9taient d\u00e9verrouill\u00e9es et que deux des trois entr\u00e9es \u00e9taient accessibles. De plus, la Direction des services juridiques d'EC a seulement conclu en novembre 2008 que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 verrouill\u00e9e, huit mois apr\u00e8s que M. Hughes ait soulev\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me et un mois apr\u00e8s une nouvelle \u00e9lection inaccessible \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil, lors de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Plus t\u00f4t, j'ai conclu que, compte tenu des affiches jaunes d'EC qui pointaient \u00e0 l'oppos\u00e9 de l'entr\u00e9e no 1, l'un des responsables d'EC savait \u00e9videmment que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e. Cependant, cette information ne s'est pas rendue au DS ou \u00e0 l'administration centrale \u00e0 Ottawa. Malheureusement, contrairement \u00e0 l'audience ACP en 1990, ni le DS ni un autre responsable pr\u00e9sent au lieu de scrutin en question n'a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant moi.\n[73] Le plaignant, avec l'aide de CCD, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une liste de cinq pages des redressements qu'il demande. L'avocat d'EC y a r\u00e9pondu verbalement et par \u00e9crit. M. Roussel a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des diverses mesures de redressement qu'EC serait pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter ou \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, y compris la coop\u00e9ration et la consultation avec les autres parties. Je suis impressionn\u00e9 par le nombre de mesures de redressement qu'EC a accept\u00e9 en tout ou en partie. Bien entendu, EC n'a pas accept\u00e9 et s'est fortement oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 certaines des mesures. Il y a un certain chevauchement entre les mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es par le plaignant et CCD et celles accept\u00e9es par EC.\n[74] Mon ordonnance quant aux mesures de redressement syst\u00e9miques ou de pratiques futures , rendue apr\u00e8s un examen attentif des observations de toutes les parties est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ci-dessous. L'application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance d\u00e9pendra de la collaboration et de la coop\u00e9ration de toutes les parties et, en particulier, d'EC puisqu'il s'agit de l'organisme intim\u00e9 envers qui l'ordonnance est dirig\u00e9e. Compte tenu de l'attitude positive d'EC \u00e0 l'audience et de l'interaction non contradictoire et coop\u00e9rative entre les parties \u00e0 l'audience, je suis convaincu que l'ordonnance sera efficace. Bien entendu, je resterai \u00e0 la disposition des parties si elles souhaitent discuter et je rendrai des directives ou d'autres ordonnances au besoin, traitant de l'application de l'ordonnance en l'esp\u00e8ce.\nContr\u00f4le, consultation, etc.\n[75] Le plaignant et CCD m'ont demand\u00e9 de nommer un contr\u00f4leur qui traitera de l'application de mon ordonnance, de fa\u00e7on semblable \u00e0 mon r\u00f4le \u00e0 titre de contr\u00f4leur dans l'affaire Lepofsky, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e (note en bas de page 13) du Tribunal des droits de la personne de l'Ontario. Ils citent aussi la d\u00e9cision McKinnon, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e \u00e0 la note en bas de page 13), dans laquelle la Commission des droits de la personne de l'Ontario a ordonn\u00e9 la cr\u00e9ation d'un Comit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le et la nomination d'une tierce partie pour \u00e9laborer et contr\u00f4ler les programmes de formation. Ils ont aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que la Commission et CCD participent \u00e0 divers aspects de l'ordonnance, participation qui s'\u00e9tend au plaignant aussi. EC soutient qu'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire de nommer un contr\u00f4leur, que la Commission pourrait prendre un r\u00f4le semblable \u00e0 celui d'un contr\u00f4leur et qu'EC et la Commission feraient rapport au Tribunal.\n[76] J'ai examin\u00e9 avec attention les observations des parties \u00e0 ce sujet. Je me trouve aussi dans une position unique puisque je suis le contr\u00f4leur dans l'affaire Lepofsky depuis 2005. Je suis d'avis qu'un contr\u00f4leur externe n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il ne s'agit pas ici d'une affaire comme Lepofsky ou McKinnon. En particulier, je note les mesures positives qu'EC a prises pendant l'audience, y compris l'admission de sa responsabilit\u00e9, son consentement \u00e0 de nombreuses mesures de redressement propos\u00e9es, en tout ou en partie, son accord quant \u00e0 la participation de la Commission apr\u00e8s l'audience et \u00e0 la consultation avec CCD ou d'autres groupes portant sur la d\u00e9ficience, ainsi qu'avec le plaignant, et la coop\u00e9ration entre toutes les parties au cours de l'audience. Si des \u00e9v\u00e9nements futurs me d\u00e9montrent que je me suis tromp\u00e9, je me r\u00e9serve le droit de nommer un contr\u00f4leur externe.\n[77] Plut\u00f4t que de nommer une tierce partie comme contr\u00f4leur, j'accepte l'offre de la Commission de contr\u00f4ler l'application de mon ordonnance. Cet exercice devrait en \u00eatre un de collaboration. EC consultera les autres parties (c'est-\u00e0-dire la Commission, le plaignant et le CCD) au sujet de divers aspects de mon ordonnance, y compris son application. EC paiera les d\u00e9penses raisonnables de CCD et du plaignant pour leur participation dans la phase d'application, mais ne paiera pas les frais juridiques de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure : voir Mowat, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, note en bas de page 7.\n[78] S'il y a un d\u00e9saccord entre EC et une autre des parties lors de la phase d'application, cette partie pourra me pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate. Bien entendu, la collaboration et la coop\u00e9ration sont essentielles pour que l'application fonctionne. Je m'attends \u00e0 ce qu'une partie demande l'aide de la Commission ou d'un m\u00e9diateur du Tribunal avant de me pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate.\nDavantage de consultation avec les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients\n[79] Je crois qu'une plus grande consultation de la part d'EC avec les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients et les groupes de personnes d\u00e9ficientes, comme le CCD, permettra de pr\u00e9venir de tels actes discriminatoires \u00e0 l'avenir. Des personnes et groupes de ce genre pourraient grandement aider EC dans presque tous les domaines vis\u00e9s par mon ordonnance en mati\u00e8re de mesures de redressement : par exemple le choix des lieux et des bureaux de scrutin, les normes d'accessibilit\u00e9, l'affichage, les manuels de formation et les programmes. Ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de se distingue, et ne contredit pas, la conclusion de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale selon laquelle le devoir d'accommodement ne comprend pas de devoir juridique de consultation.18\n[80] M. Roussel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des divers groupes qu'EC a consult\u00e9s au sujet des lieux de scrutin, tels que les d\u00e9put\u00e9s, les a\u00een\u00e9s autochtones, les leaders \u00e9tudiants, etc. Pourquoi ne pas aussi consulter des personnes d\u00e9ficientes et des groupes de personnes d\u00e9ficientes? M. Roussel \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s ouvert aux diverses suggestions au sujet d'une plus grande participation et consultation des personnes d\u00e9ficientes et des groupes de personnes d\u00e9ficientes par EC. Il a aussi t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des nombreux sondages, \u00e9tudes et bilans effectu\u00e9s par EC apr\u00e8s chaque \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Par exemple, EC effectue un Sondage aupr\u00e8s des a\u00een\u00e9s et des jeunes autochtones . Pourquoi ne pas aussi effectuer un Sondage aupr\u00e8s des personnes d\u00e9ficientes et des groupes de personnes d\u00e9ficientes ? EC examinera la suggestion pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, en discutera avec les autres parties, en particulier avec le CCD, et formulera un plan de consultation dans les six mois \u00e0 venir.\nOrdonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire\n[81] EC cessera de situer des bureaux de scrutin dans des lieux qui n'offrent pas un acc\u00e8s facile, dans toutes les circonscriptions du Canada, en application de l'article 5 de la LCDP. Cette ordonnance est assujettie \u00e0 la norme de la justification de bonne foi et du devoir d'accommodement jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP, respectivement, lorsqu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[82] Rien dans mes motifs ou mon ordonnance ne vise \u00e0 gouverner l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du DGE pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 121(2) de la LCE permettant l'exemption d'un lieu de scrutin de l'exigence d'acc\u00e8s de plainpied. En l'esp\u00e8ce, aucune exemption au sens du paragraphe 121(2) n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e par le DGE pour l'\u00e9glise St. Basil. Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t dans mes motifs, EC fournit d\u00e9j\u00e0 un meilleur accommodement dans le domaine de l'accessibilit\u00e9 que l'acc\u00e8s de plainpied (c'est-\u00e0-dire un acc\u00e8s plat, sans escaliers). Je ne me pr\u00e9occupe pas de ce que la LCE exige en mati\u00e8re d'accommodements pour la d\u00e9ficience et d'accessibilit\u00e9, mais plut\u00f4t de ce que la LCDP exige. EC reconna\u00eet que la LCDP s'applique \u00e0 elle. Cependant, dans sa d\u00e9claration d'ouverture, l'avocat d'EC a mentionn\u00e9 la s\u00e9paration des pouvoirs. Sans contester la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal en l'esp\u00e8ce, il a mentionn\u00e9 que [traduction] certaines choses devraient \u00eatre laiss\u00e9es au Parlement et \u00e0 ses organismes .\nR\u00e9pertoire des installations \u00e9lectorales\n[83] Le plaignant et CCD me demandent d'ordonner \u00e0 EC d'examiner ce r\u00e9pertoire de plus de 27 000 lieux de scrutin au Canada, de le mettre \u00e0 jour et d'en faire rapport. EC soutient qu'une telle v\u00e9rification dans tout le pays de chacun des lieux de scrutin serait extr\u00eamement difficile du point de vue logistique. L'avocat d'EC mentionne correctement que le plaignant n'a pas prouv\u00e9 l'existence d'une erreur dans le r\u00e9pertoire \u00e9lectronique, sauf en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'\u00e9glise St. Basil. Il soutient que l'erreur n'\u00e9tait pas due aux renseignements au sujet de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil dans le r\u00e9pertoire ni \u00e0 la structure physique de l'\u00e9glise. Plut\u00f4t, l'erreur \u00e9tait due au fait que l'entr\u00e9e no 1 \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e lors des deux \u00e9lections.\n[84] Je conviens que le fait de v\u00e9rifier 27 000 lieux de scrutin est une t\u00e2che \u00e9norme. Cependant, M. Roussel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'EC avait pour habitude de visiter chaque lieu (actuel et \u00e9ventuel), avant les \u00e9lections r\u00e9centes des gouvernements minoritaires. La derni\u00e8re v\u00e9rification nationale a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e en 2002. Les directives et les manuels exigent que les DS examinent les lieux avant qu'une \u00e9lection soit d\u00e9clench\u00e9e et en assurent la location apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9clenchement de l'\u00e9lection. Le r\u00e9pertoire national est un outil ou un moyen d'atteindre l'objectif de l'acc\u00e8s facile au vote pour les Canadiens. Je n'ordonnerai pas \u00e0 EC d'effectuer une telle v\u00e9rification ni de pr\u00e9senter un rapport public \u00e0 ce sujet. L'acte discriminatoire dont est accus\u00e9e EC n'\u00e9tait pas caus\u00e9 par les donn\u00e9es inscrites pour l'\u00e9glise St. Basil dans le r\u00e9pertoire des installations \u00e9lectorales. Cependant, je note qu'EC accepte, dans les six mois \u00e0 venir, de [traduction] mettre en place une proc\u00e9dure pour la v\u00e9rification de l'accessibilit\u00e9 des installations le jour d'une \u00e9lection . EC effectuera cette v\u00e9rification et consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nNormes d'accessibilit\u00e9\n[85] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question des normes d'accessibilit\u00e9, il ne s'agissait pas d'une source de responsabilit\u00e9 pour EC en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il n'y avait pas suffisamment de liens avec l'acte discriminatoire. Bien entendu, les normes changent et \u00e9voluent, en termes de philosophies, d'attitudes et de technologies. Par cons\u00e9quent, je recommande, mais je n'ordonne pas, \u00e0 EC d'examiner les normes d'accessibilit\u00e9 qu'il utilise et de consulter les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet. Ces normes sont comprises, mais ne se limitent pas, \u00e0 la page 2, paragraphe 4, de la liste r\u00e9vis\u00e9e des mesures de redressement demand\u00e9es par le plaignant.\nPolitiques et directives\n[86] Les politiques et les directives d'EC au sujet de l'accessibilit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9es et mises \u00e0 jour, mais elles n'\u00e9taient pas un facteur important dans mes conclusions de responsabilit\u00e9. Cependant, EC accepte, dans les 12 mois \u00e0 venir, de [traduction] r\u00e9viser le livret sur les lieux accessibles, la grille d'\u00e9valuation de l'accessibilit\u00e9 et les sections portant sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 dans les manuels des directeurs de scrutin et des cat\u00e9gories susmentionn\u00e9es de responsables des \u00e9lections [SCS, agents r\u00e9viseurs, greffiers du scrutin, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'information et directeurs du scrutin] . J'ordonne \u00e0 EC de le faire et de consulter les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nBail normalis\u00e9 pour les lieux de scrutin\n[87] Le plaignant et CCD me demandent d'ordonner \u00e0 EC de r\u00e9viser son bail normalis\u00e9 pour les lieux de scrutin afin que celuici comprenne l'exigence que les lieux lou\u00e9s aient un acc\u00e8s facile. Si le bail de l'\u00e9glise St. Basil avait compris une telle condition, cela aurait pu entra\u00eener une discussion au sujet de l'entr\u00e9e no 1 et pr\u00e9venir le fait qu'elle \u00e9tait verrouill\u00e9e le jour de l'\u00e9lection partielle et de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Une telle disposition augmente la conscience du locateur et du locataire au sujet des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 et pourrait raisonnablement pr\u00e9venir un acte semblable dans l'avenir. J'ordonne \u00e0 EC d'effectuer cette r\u00e9vision dans les six mois \u00e0 venir et de consulter les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nAffichage dans les lieux de scrutin et les bureaux de scrutin\n[88] J'accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Hughes au sujet de l'insuffisance de l'affichage lors de l'\u00e9lection partielle et de l'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. EC a aussi admis l'insuffisance des affiches menant \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e no 2. L'affichage est particuli\u00e8rement important puisque la majorit\u00e9 des \u00e9lecteurs conna\u00eetront moins bien la disposition de leur lieu de scrutin que celle de leur maison ou de leur lieu de travail. EC accepte la demande du plaignant que le Tribunal ordonne l'affichage suffisant et appropri\u00e9 lors des \u00e9lections, affichage qui doit comprendre le symbole universel d'accessibilit\u00e9 afin que les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients puissent facilement trouver le chemin le plus rapide et le plus appropri\u00e9 \u00e0 toutes les entr\u00e9es accessibles d'un lieu de scrutin. J'ordonne \u00e0 EC de le faire et de consulter les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nFormation\n[89] Le mat\u00e9riel et les protocoles de formation peuvent toujours \u00eatre am\u00e9lior\u00e9s. En l'esp\u00e8ce, le probl\u00e8me portait plus sur les responsables qui n'ont pas suivi les instructions, plut\u00f4t que sur la formation m\u00eame. Par exemple, M. Roussel a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le superviseur du Centre de scrutin avait le devoir de v\u00e9rifier si les bureaux de scrutin fonctionnaient correctement le jour de l'\u00e9lection, y compris de v\u00e9rifier si l'entr\u00e9e no 1 (la seule entr\u00e9e accessible) \u00e9tait ouverte. Cependant, le nonrespect par les responsables des instructions qui leur sont donn\u00e9es lors de la formation est aussi un facteur de la fa\u00e7on dont ils sont form\u00e9s. Une meilleure formation, y compris son application, pourrait pr\u00e9venir de tels commentaires comme celui que le responsable d'EC a fait \u00e0 M. Hughes au sujet du manque de financement suffisant pour rendre les installations accessibles lors des \u00e9lections partielles, ainsi que du manque d'espace suffisant entre les tables des bureaux de scrutin.\n[90] Une formation au sujet des plaintes en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 et du traitement appropri\u00e9 de ces plaintes par les responsables des lieux de scrutin et l'administration centrale devrait aussi \u00eatre offerte. J'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Roussel au sujet du manque de formation portant sur les questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 pour une grande partie des fonctionnaires \u00e0 l'administration centrale d'EC, qui traitent, de pr\u00e8s ou de loin, des questions de d\u00e9ficience et d'accessibilit\u00e9.\n[91] Le plaignant et CCD demandent une ordonnance visant l'examen et la mise \u00e0 jour du mat\u00e9riel de formation et des programmes de formation pour tous les gestionnaires, les employ\u00e9s et les responsables, qu'ils soient \u00e0 temps plein ou \u00e0 temps partiel, permanents ou temporaires, qui ont \u00e0 traiter des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9. Cela comprend le DGE qui se trouve au sommet de la pyramide d'EC, jusqu'aux 200 000 responsables employ\u00e9s le jour de l'\u00e9lection. Ils demandent aussi que le mat\u00e9riel de formation comprenne les pr\u00e9sents motifs de d\u00e9cision (ou un r\u00e9sum\u00e9) et que la d\u00e9cision fasse partie d'une \u00e9tude de cas lors de s\u00e9ances de formation. Je note qu'EC tient une s\u00e9ance interactive constitu\u00e9e d'\u00e9tudes de cas lors de la formation des DS. EC accepte, dans les 12 mois \u00e0 venir, d'examiner son mat\u00e9riel et ses programmes de formation pour les DS et les responsables subordonn\u00e9s, mais s'inqui\u00e8te de l'extension de cette formation au DGE. EC est aussi pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par les complexit\u00e9s logistiques de la formation de 200 000 responsables temporaires qui travaillent le jour de l'\u00e9lection.\n[92] Le mat\u00e9riel et les programmes de formation, ou les s\u00e9ances de formation, devraient \u00eatre examin\u00e9s, r\u00e9vis\u00e9s et mis \u00e0 jour en ce qui a trait aux questions d'accessibilit\u00e9. La formation devrait \u00eatre offerte \u00e0 chaque responsable ou employ\u00e9 qui traite de questions de d\u00e9ficience ou d'accessibilit\u00e9, y compris le DGE et les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, les responsables de l'accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'administration centrale, les DS et les autres responsables dans les circonscriptions (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'arm\u00e9e de 200 000 responsables qui travaillent le jour de l'\u00e9lection). Je note que dans l'affaire Lepofsky, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 la formation de tous les responsables appropri\u00e9s et employ\u00e9s, y compris les commissaires et les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs de la Toronto Transit Commission. La formation peut \u00eatre ajust\u00e9e en fonction de la personne, selon ses responsabilit\u00e9s \u00e0 EC. J'accepte aussi la demande que le mat\u00e9riel de formation comprenne mes motifs de d\u00e9cision ou un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 et qu'une \u00e9tude de cas soit pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de ma d\u00e9cision.\nProcessus de plaintes en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9\n[93] Le mauvais traitement des plaintes \u00e9crites et verbales de M. Hughes, y compris l'enqu\u00eate d'EC, a engag\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 d'EC, et je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la situation. EC accepte, dans les six mois \u00e0 venir, de [traduction] mettre en place une proc\u00e9dure pour la r\u00e9ception, l'enregistrement et le traitement de plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites au sujet du manque d'accessibilit\u00e9.\n[94] Je conviens qu'un processus de plaintes public doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli par EC pour des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9. Ce processus devrait aussi faire l'objet d'une publicit\u00e9 appropri\u00e9e (p. ex. dans les lieux de scrutin, sur le site Web d'EC et sur la carte d'information de l'\u00e9lecteur). Il devrait comprendre le suivi des plaintes et leur r\u00e8glement. Le nombre de plaintes re\u00e7ues au sujet des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 devraient faire l'objet d'un rapport public, possiblement dans le rapport suivant l'\u00e9lection du DGE. Bien entendu, les employ\u00e9s d'EC doivent \u00eatre form\u00e9s \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[95] Il est important d'effectuer des rapports au sujet des plaintes de manque d'accessibilit\u00e9 dans les lieux de scrutin et dans les bureaux de scrutin. EC accepte [traduction] de faire de tels rapports pendant une p\u00e9riode de trois cycles complets d'\u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, si cette exigence peut \u00eatre mise en uvre d'une fa\u00e7on qui convient \u00e0 ses restrictions op\u00e9rationnelles . Les plaintes en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 feront partie du rapport du DGE au Parlement apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection. J'ordonne \u00e0 EC d'effectuer un tel rapport, conform\u00e9ment aux conditions \u00e9tablies dans la lettre de l'avocat au Tribunal du 23 octobre 2009.\nExemptions en vertu du paragraphe 121(2) de la LCE\n[96] Le plaignant me demande d'ordonner que de telles exemptions soient examin\u00e9es avec des consultants de groupes locaux de personnes d\u00e9ficientes et, s'il est conclu que l'exemption est valide, qu'elle soit publiquement annonc\u00e9e et qu'elle comprenne les options de rechange pour les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients. Pr\u00e9sentement, le DGE \u00e9num\u00e8re dans son rapport au Parlement apr\u00e8s l'\u00e9lection le nombre d'exemptions accord\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe 121(2) lors de la campagne \u00e9lectorale. Ni le plaignant, ni CCD ne contestent la validit\u00e9 du paragraphe 121(2). Je ne crois pas que l'acte discriminatoire d'EC en l'esp\u00e8ce d\u00e9coulait d'une exemption au sens du paragraphe 121(2) et, par cons\u00e9quent, je ne rends aucune ordonnance de pratiques futures \u00e0 ce sujet.\nSuspension de trois mois si une \u00e9lection est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e\n[97] J'accepte la demande d'EC que les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances et les activit\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant des mesures de redressement pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes soient suspendues pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois si une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e. Il s'agit d'une demande raisonnable compte tenu de la preuve qui m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au sujet de l'horaire charg\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de l'administration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale d'EC et des responsables des circonscriptions lorsqu'une \u00e9lection est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e. Bien entendu, cette ordonnance n'affecte pas l'octroi de l'indemnit\u00e9, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat et l'ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire.\nRapports au Tribunal\n[98] EC me pr\u00e9sentera des rapports \u00e0 un intervalle d'au plus trois mois au sujet du progr\u00e8s de l'application de mon ordonnance. J'encourage la Commission, mais je ne l'oblige pas, \u00e0 me pr\u00e9senter un rapport p\u00e9riodique au sujet de toute question portant sur son contr\u00f4le de l'application de mon ordonnance.19\nLe Tribunal restera saisi de l'affaire\n[99] Les parties acceptent que le Tribunal reste saisi de l'affaire. Je resterai saisi de l'affaire jusqu'\u00e0 ce que mon ordonnance soit compl\u00e8tement appliqu\u00e9e, y compris les ordonnances ou les directives suppl\u00e9mentaires que je pourrais rendre, au besoin. Cependant, EC, dans la lettre de son avocat au Tribunal du 23 octobre 2009, a accept\u00e9 l'application par phase d'un syst\u00e8me de rapports complet sur un cycle de trois \u00e9lections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales. Cela pourrait se terminer en 2020. Je ne crois pas qu'il serait sage de rester saisi de l'affaire pour une si longue p\u00e9riode. Par cons\u00e9quent, je resterai saisi de l'affaire jusqu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re date du rapport qui sera pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 apr\u00e8s la prochaine \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de l'application des autres parties de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, y compris toute application de toute autre ordonnance que je pourrais rendre, au besoin.\nXVI. Ordonnance [100] Comme j'ai conclu qu'EC a fait preuve d'acte discriminatoire au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP, la plainte de James Peter Hughes est fond\u00e9e et je rends l'ordonnance suivante :\nIndemnit\u00e9 et int\u00e9r\u00eats\n1. EC paiera \u00e0 M. Hughes 10 000 $ pour le pr\u00e9judice moral dont il a souffert en raison de l'acte discriminatoire, au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP, plus int\u00e9r\u00eats, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et au paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP.\nContr\u00f4le, consultation, etc.\n2. Comme la Commission l'a offert, elle contr\u00f4lera l'application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance et l'application de toute ordonnance subs\u00e9quente. EC consultera les autres parties (c'est-\u00e0-dire la Commission, le plaignant et CCD) au sujet de divers aspects de mon ordonnance, y compris son application. EC paiera les d\u00e9penses raisonnables de CCD et du plaignant pour leur participation \u00e0 la phase d'application, mais ne paiera pas les frais juridiques relatifs \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\nMeilleure consultation des \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients\n3. Dans les six mois \u00e0 venir, EC formulera un plan visant une meilleure consultation des \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients et des groupes de personnes d\u00e9ficientes, en consultant les autres parties.\nOrdonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire\n4. EC arr\u00eatera de placer des bureaux de scrutin dans des lieux qui n'offrent pas un acc\u00e8s facile, dans toutes les circonscriptions du Canada, suivant l'article 5 de la LCDP. Cette ordonnance est assujettie \u00e0 la norme de la justification de bonne foi et au devoir d'accommodement jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 15(1)g) et du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP, respectivement, lorsqu'une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nV\u00e9rification de l'accessibilit\u00e9 des installations\n5. Dans les six mois \u00e0 venir, EC mettra en place une proc\u00e9dure de v\u00e9rification de l'accessibilit\u00e9 des installations le jour d'une \u00e9lection et consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nPolitiques et directives\n6. Dans les 12 mois \u00e0 venir, EC examinera le livret sur les lieux accessibles, la grille d'\u00e9valuation de l'accessibilit\u00e9 et les sections sur l'accessibilit\u00e9 des manuels des directeurs de scrutins et des autres cat\u00e9gories de responsables des \u00e9lections (c'est-\u00e0-dire les DAS, SCS, DS, greffiers du scrutin, pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l'information et directeurs du scrutin). EC consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nBail normalis\u00e9 pour les lieux de scrutin\n7. Dans les six mois \u00e0 venir, EC r\u00e9visera son bail normalis\u00e9 pour les lieux de scrutin afin d'ajouter l'exigence selon laquelle les lieux lou\u00e9s doivent fournir un acc\u00e8s de plain-pied et un acc\u00e8s facile. EC consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nAffichage aux lieux et aux bureaux de scrutin\n8. EC fournira un affichage suffisant et appropri\u00e9 aux \u00e9lections, qui comprendra le symbole universel d'accessibilit\u00e9, afin que les \u00e9lecteurs d\u00e9ficients puissent facilement trouver la route la plus courte et la plus appropri\u00e9e pour se rendre aux entr\u00e9es accessibles des lieux de scrutin. EC consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nFormation\n9. Dans les 12 mois \u00e0 venir, EC examinera, r\u00e9visera et mettra \u00e0 jour son mat\u00e9riel et ses programmes de formation portant sur des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 pour les DS et les responsables subordonn\u00e9s. La formation devrait \u00eatre offerte \u00e0 tous les responsables ou les employ\u00e9s qui traitent des questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 et de d\u00e9ficience, y compris le DGE et les cadres sup\u00e9rieurs, les responsables de l'accessibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l'administration centrale, les DS et les autres employ\u00e9s dans les circonscriptions. La formation pourra \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la personne, en fonction de ses responsabilit\u00e9s au sein d'EC. Les responsables d'EC seront aussi form\u00e9s au sujet du nouveau processus de plaintes public. Le mat\u00e9riel de formation comprendra aussi les pr\u00e9sents motifs de d\u00e9cision, ou un r\u00e9sum\u00e9, et une \u00e9tude de cas pr\u00e9par\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de la d\u00e9cision pour les fins de la formation. EC consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nProcessus de plaintes en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9\n10 Dans les six mois \u00e0 venir, EC mettra en place une proc\u00e9dure pour la r\u00e9ception, l'enregistrement et le traitement de plaintes verbales et \u00e9crites au sujet du manque d'accessibilit\u00e9. Ce processus devrait aussi \u00eatre publicis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e (p. ex. dans les lieux de scrutin, sur le site Web d'EC et sur la carte d'information de l'\u00e9lecteur). Le processus devrait comprendre le suivi des plaintes et leur r\u00e8glement. Le nombre de plaintes re\u00e7ues au sujet de questions d'accessibilit\u00e9 devra faire l'objet d'un rapport public. EC s'acquittera de cette exigence en mati\u00e8re de rapport pour une p\u00e9riode de trois cycles complets d'\u00e9lections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales, dans le rapport suivant l'\u00e9lection du DGE au Parlement et conform\u00e9ment aux conditions \u00e9tablies dans la lettre de l'avocat d'EC au Tribunal du 23 octobre 2009. EC consultera les autres parties \u00e0 ce sujet.\nSuspension de trois mois si une \u00e9lection est d\u00e9clench\u00e9e\n11. Les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances et les activit\u00e9s pour les mesures de redressement susmentionn\u00e9es seront suspendues pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois si une \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale devait \u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9e, sauf en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'indemnit\u00e9 et les int\u00e9r\u00eats, ainsi qu'\u00e0 l'ordonnance de mettre fin \u00e0 l'acte discriminatoire.\nRapport d'EC au Tribunal\n12. EC fera rapport au Tribunal \u00e0 des intervalles d'au plus trois mois au sujet du progr\u00e8s de l'application de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\nLe Tribunal restera saisi de l'affaire\n13. Le Tribunal restera saisi de l'affaire jusqu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re date du rapport sur les plaintes en mati\u00e8re d'accessibilit\u00e9 d'EC apr\u00e8s la prochaine \u00e9lection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de l'application des autres parties de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance, y compris toute ordonnance suppl\u00e9mentaire, au besoin.\nSign\u00e9 par\nMatthew D.

LA D\u00c9CISION\nI. LA PLAINTE A. D\u00e9ficience physique - Emploi [1] Mme Roopnarine a travaill\u00e9 pour la Banque de Montr\u00e9al (BMO) pendant 31 ans. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9e par BMO en 1975, alors qu'elle avait 20 ans, et a occup\u00e9 divers postes, d'op\u00e9ratrice de machine de contr\u00f4le \u00e0 commis \u00e0 la saisie de donn\u00e9es, d'agente de recouvrement \u00e0 enqu\u00eateure en mati\u00e8re de fraude. BMO l'a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2007 et lui a donn\u00e9 une indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 autoris\u00e9, \u00e0 titre d'accommodement pour une blessure au poignet. Ce cong\u00e9 devait \u00eatre prolong\u00e9 sur pr\u00e9sentation d'un rapport m\u00e9dical \u00e0 cet effet. BMO a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine avant que ce rapport n'ait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Mme Roopnarine soutient qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[2] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, Mme Roopnarine pr\u00e9sente les arguments suivants : son rendement, jusqu'\u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement, \u00e9tait satisfaisant et ses \u00e9valuations de rendement avant 2003 en faisaient \u00e9tat; ses \u00e9valuations de rendement subs\u00e9quentes \u00e9taient erron\u00e9es et injustes; le processus et le contenu de ses \u00e9valuations ne respectaient pas la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tablie et les gestionnaires ne lui ont pas mentionn\u00e9 de probl\u00e8mes de rendement; alors qu'elle souffrait d'une blessure au poignet, BMO s'est servie de ces \u00e9valuations comme pr\u00e9texte pour la cong\u00e9dier, alors que le v\u00e9ritable motif derri\u00e8re son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait que BMO ne souhaitait pas prendre de mesures d'accommodement pour sa blessure au poignet.\nII. LES CONCLUSIONS FACTUELLES A. Conclusions en l'esp\u00e8ce Ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents professionnels\n[3] En janvier 2002, Mme Roopnarine a tent\u00e9 d'obtenir une promotion. Elle souhaitait quitter le service de recouvrement et obtenir un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'enqu\u00eateure en mati\u00e8re de fraude. Elle s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'entrevue pour ce poste, mais elle n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue. Puis, toujours en janvier 2002, elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa candidature pour un poste d'analyste en mati\u00e8re de fraude et elle a obtenu une mutation lat\u00e9rale \u00e0 ce poste.\n[4] Elle travaillait dans le volet de fraude hypoth\u00e9caire connu sous le nom de Gemini, dans l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9tection des fraudes. Son travail consistait \u00e0 mener des enqu\u00eates et des analyses sur les demandes qui \u00e9taient possiblement li\u00e9es \u00e0 de la fraude hypoth\u00e9caire. Par exemple, si l'identit\u00e9 d'un client qui tentait d'obtenir une hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait mise en doute, Mme Roopnarine devait prendre des mesures afin de d\u00e9terminer si la demande d'hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait frauduleuse ou satisfaisante. Cette enqu\u00eate comprenait un examen des renseignements \u00e0 l'ordinateur, une discussion avec l'employeur du demandeur pour v\u00e9rification, un examen visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir si le num\u00e9ro d'assurance sociale et l'adresse du demandeur correspondaient, ainsi qu'une analyse des renseignements de cr\u00e9dit. Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate approfondie, elle devait d\u00e9terminer s'il y avait fraude. S'il n'y avait pas de fraude, la demande d'hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e. La demande \u00e9tait envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre \u00e9quipe, qui avisait le demandeur que sa demande \u00e9tait satisfaisante. Si Mme Roopnarine d\u00e9terminait \u00e0 tort que la demande d'hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait insatisfaisante, alors qu'elle aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e, BMO perdait un client, puisque la demande \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e. BMO avait 24 heures pour aviser le demandeur d'hypoth\u00e8que que sa demande \u00e9tait accept\u00e9e ou rejet\u00e9e.\n[5] L'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9tection de fraude de BMO comportait cinq volets, dont Gemini et CRDS. Le volet CRDS visait \u00e0 d\u00e9tecter la prise de contr\u00f4le de comptes. Il s'agissait du volet de base dans lequel les nouveaux employ\u00e9s et les \u00e9tudiants recevaient leur formation de d\u00e9part.\n[6] Lorsque Mme Roopnarine a \u00e9t\u00e9 mut\u00e9e en 2002, elle a conserv\u00e9 son \u00e9chelon et son niveau de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration et elle est devenue l'employ\u00e9e qui occupait l'\u00e9chelon le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 et qui recevait la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration la plus importante de toute l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9tection de fraude. D\u00e8s la date de sa mutation, elle a re\u00e7u beaucoup de formation continue au cours des ann\u00e9es, tant dans le volet Gemini que dans le volet CRDS. Cependant, en mai 2006, elle n'avait toujours pas acquis les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour effectuer les t\u00e2ches d'une analyste en mati\u00e8re de fraude dans ces deux volets. Quant \u00e0 elle, Mme Roopnarine croyait qu'elle m\u00e9ritait une promotion \u00e0 un poste plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d'enqu\u00eateure en mati\u00e8re de fraude depuis 2002. Pourtant, m\u00eame jusqu'en janvier 2007, elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable d'acqu\u00e9rir l'ensemble de comp\u00e9tences de base pour travailler dans deux des cinq volets, ou elle avait refus\u00e9 de le faire. Ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 document\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de l'\u00e9valuation de rendement de la fin d'ann\u00e9e 2003-2004.\n[7] Dans un examen semestriel de son rendement, pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er novembre 2003 au 30 avril 2004, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 qu'elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 avec sa productivit\u00e9 et sa comp\u00e9tence. Mme Roopnarine a contest\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation et, dans son \u00e9valuation de fin d'ann\u00e9e pour la p\u00e9riode du 1er novembre 2003 au 31 octobre 2004, elle a re\u00e7u la cote [traduction] r\u00e9pond aux attentes . Dans cette \u00e9valuation de fin d'ann\u00e9e, on reconnaissait qu'elle avait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 l'ensemble de sa productivit\u00e9 depuis juillet, auquel moment ses gestionnaires lui ont retir\u00e9 certaines de ses t\u00e2ches r\u00e9guli\u00e8res pour qu'elle puisse se concentrer sur un plan de formation complet en mati\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tences. Cependant, l'\u00e9valuation faisait aussi \u00e9tat de sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 suivre les normes prescrites, du fait qu'elle devait am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences et augmenter l'efficacit\u00e9 et l'efficience de l'\u00e9quipe et du fait qu'elle recevait et appliquait la r\u00e9troaction \u00e0 contrecur. Plut\u00f4t que d'accepter qu'elle devait s'am\u00e9liorer, Mme Roopnarine a adopt\u00e9 une attitude d\u00e9fensive. Elle a d'abord refus\u00e9 de signer son \u00e9valuation de rendement de 2003-2004, malgr\u00e9 ses nombreuses discussions avec les employ\u00e9s de BMO et leurs commentaires. Elle a finalement sign\u00e9 son \u00e9valuation et y a annex\u00e9 ses notes personnelles au sujet de son rendement.\n[8] BMO a continu\u00e9 de lui fournir de la formation et du soutien. Dans son \u00e9valuation de fin d'ann\u00e9e pour 2004-2005, elle a de nouveau re\u00e7u la cote [traduction] r\u00e9pond aux attentes et l'\u00e9valuation en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tait plus positive que celle de l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Il y \u00e9tait confirm\u00e9 qu'elle avait une connaissance approfondie du volet Gemini et une connaissance fonctionnelle du volet CRDS. Par contre, il y \u00e9tait aussi pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'il \u00e9tait essentiel que Mme Roopnarine re\u00e7oive plus de formation afin de mettre l'importance sur la formation continue et l'am\u00e9lioration de ses comp\u00e9tences et qu'il \u00e9tait obligatoire qu'elle satisfasse aux exigences minimales du service. Elle a sign\u00e9 et accept\u00e9 cette \u00e9valuation.\nProbl\u00e8mes de rendement - avant la blessure au poignet\n[9] En avril 2006, Mme Jamie Khan est devenue gestionnaire de l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9tection de la fraude. Mme Khan travaillait pour BMO depuis 24 ans et elle avait de l'exp\u00e9rience dans les pr\u00eats, les hypoth\u00e8ques, la d\u00e9tection de la fraude et les services d'enqu\u00eate.\n[10] Dans le cadre de son initiative de gestion, elle a rencontr\u00e9 personnellement chacun des 15 employ\u00e9s de l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9tection de la fraude pour discuter de leurs comp\u00e9tences et de leurs objectifs. De tous les 15 membres, Mme Khan a observ\u00e9 que, sauf pour Mme Roopnarine, chaque membre \u00e9tait capable de travailler dans au moins trois des cinq volets et que bon nombre d'entre eux \u00e9taient capables de travailler dans quatre des cinq volets. Pourtant, Mme Roopnarine avait travaill\u00e9 principalement dans un seul volet, soit Gemini.\n[11] Mme Khan a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine vers avril 2006. Mme Roopnarine lui a dit qu'elle \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s qualifi\u00e9e et qu'elle occupait un \u00e9chelon \u00e9lev\u00e9. Elle lui a aussi dit qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7ue de ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour la promotion au poste d'enqu\u00eateure en mati\u00e8re de fraude dans un autre domaine en 2002. Mme Khan lui a dit qu'il lui ferait plaisir de l'aider \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer et \u00e0 \u00e9tendre son ensemble de comp\u00e9tences pour qu'elle soit plus qualifi\u00e9e lorsqu'une occasion se pr\u00e9senterait \u00e0 l'avenir. Par cons\u00e9quent, pour am\u00e9liorer sa connaissance d'autres volets et pour ramener son ensemble de comp\u00e9tences au niveau de ses coll\u00e8gues moins anciens, Mme Khan a dit \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine qu'elle la transf\u00e8rerait au volet CRDS. Mme Khan a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsque Mme Roopnarine aurait ma\u00eetris\u00e9 les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour ce volet et qu'elle y travaillerait de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante, elle retournerait au volet Gemini pour y am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences. Mme Khan a transf\u00e9r\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine au volet CRDS le 11 mai 2006.\n[12] Pour le volet CRDS, Mme Khan a offert \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine une formation intensive du 12 au 16 mai 2006, pendant laquelle un formateur s'est assis avec elle \u00e0 son bureau pour la guider et lui a montr\u00e9 comment produire des rapports CRDS, comment traiter les retraits internationaux et comment faire des rapports au sujet de son travail dans des t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements aux gestionnaires. Mme Roopnarine devait enqu\u00eater et relever les cas d'\u00e9cr\u00e9mage dans les comptes des clients. L'\u00e9cr\u00e9mage est un type de fraude de carte de cr\u00e9dit par lequel les criminels retirent de l'argent des comptes bancaires. L'analyste de jour a la responsabilit\u00e9 de t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le syst\u00e8me \u00e0 8 h, midi et 16 h et d'examiner les comptes cibl\u00e9s pour v\u00e9rifier s'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cr\u00e9m\u00e9s .\n[13] Tant le volet Gemini que le volet CRDS n\u00e9cessitent de la part de l'analyste qu'il mette un ordinateur en marche et qu'il utilise un clavier et une souris pour examiner les comptes cibl\u00e9s. L'analyste doit inscrire un num\u00e9ro pour obtenir les renseignements. Il y a tr\u00e8s peu de diff\u00e9rences entre les exigences physiques des deux postes. Cependant, plus de comptes doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9s dans le volet CRDS. Alors qu'elle travaillait dans le volet CRDS, Mme Roopnarine continuait de travailler de temps \u00e0 autres dans le volet Gemini. Malgr\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u de la formation pour le volet CRDS et de l'encadrement continu de Mme Khan, Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait incapable de travailler dans le volet CRDS ou elle ne souhaitait pas le faire. Elle ne respectait pas les proc\u00e9dures. Elle ne traitait pas le nombre minimal de comptes et ne suivait pas l'horaire de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement.\n[14] Mme Roopnarine a reconnu ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement et, quelques mois apr\u00e8s son transfert dans l'\u00e9quipe du CRDS, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khan d'\u00eatre retransf\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 celle de Gemini, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait plus difficile d'\u00e9valuer son mauvais rendement. Mme Roopnarine a continu\u00e9 de se plaindre \u00e0 Mme Khan du fait qu'elle \u00e9tait d\u00e9\u00e7ue de ne pas avoir obtenu d'augmentation de salaire ni de promotion.\n[15] Entre mai 2006 et octobre 2006, Mme Khan et Mme Roopnarine se sont rencontr\u00e9es de nombreuses fois, parfois en pr\u00e9sence de Mme Coupland, la gestionnaire de Mme Khan. Mme Khan a souvent offert \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine des critiques constructives, tant au sujet du volet CRDS que du volet Gemini. Mme Khan lui a dit qu'elle n'enqu\u00eatait pas pleinement les cas suspects de fraude et qu'elle travaillait au hasard plut\u00f4t que de fa\u00e7on syst\u00e9matique, comme on lui demandait. En m\u00eame temps, elle a aussi offert \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine de la formation et du soutien continus de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 l'aider. Le 1er juin 2006, Mme Roopnarine s'est entendue avec Mme Khan que d\u00e8s qu'elle satisferait aux attentes en mati\u00e8re de rendement pour volet CRDS, Mme Khan la transf\u00e8rerait au volet Gemini. Malgr\u00e9 cette entente, Mme Roopnarine a continu\u00e9 de se plaindre, jusqu'en septembre 2006, du fait que son exp\u00e9rience, ses connaissance et ses comp\u00e9tences ne co\u00efncidaient pas avec son r\u00f4le dans le volet CRDS et qu'elle souhaitait retourner au volet Gemini. Elle ne s'est pas plainte de ses t\u00e2ches par rapport \u00e0 une quelconque blessure au poignet.\n[16] Apr\u00e8s cinq mois dans le volet CRDS, malgr\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u de la formation et de l'encadrement approfondis, de la r\u00e9troaction et du soutien continu, Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait incapable d'effectuer le travail. Elle avait des probl\u00e8mes techniques et une mauvaise productivit\u00e9 : elle traitait 7,5 comptes par heure, alors que la norme du service \u00e9tait de 25 \u00e0 35 comptes par heure. Plusieurs fois, elle a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 de suivre toute la proc\u00e9dure du volet CRDS et elle travaillait au hasard. Elle avait aussi des probl\u00e8mes techniques. Par exemple, en juin 2006, elle a de nouveau fait glisser un fichier ma\u00eetre du volet CRDS dans le mauvais dossier, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une perte de productivit\u00e9 pour les autres analystes, qui ne pouvaient pas le trouver et qui ne pouvaient donc pas travailler sur d'autres comptes. Lorsque Mme Khan a confront\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine au sujet de ces probl\u00e8mes, cette derni\u00e8re a continu\u00e9 d'insister qu'elle voulait retourner dans le volet Gemini. Elle n'a re\u00e7u aucune prime de rendement et aucune augmentation de son salaire de base en 2006.\nDouleurs au poignet, avant l'accommodement\n[17] Au cours de son emploi, Mme Roopnarine a eu un certain nombre de d\u00e9ficiences qui n\u00e9cessitaient un accommodement. BMO est un employeur de grande envergure et, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses politiques d'accommodement g\u00e9r\u00e9es par Oncidium Health Group (Oncidium), elle a accommod\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine en 2003 lorsqu'elle a demand\u00e9 une modification \u00e0 son poste de travail en raison d'une blessure, modification qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e. BMO avait un contrat avec un tiers pour la gestion des d\u00e9ficiences et ce tiers travaillait en collaboration avec Oncidium. Oncidium \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer les demandes d'accommodement et de v\u00e9rifier que toutes les demandes d'accommodement \u00e9taient \u00e9valu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et impartiale.\n[18] La premi\u00e8re fois que Mme Roopnarine a dit \u00e0 Mme Khan qu'elle ressentait de la douleur au poignet \u00e9tait le 5 octobre 2006, lors d'une conversation g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque, Mme Roopnarine avait inscrit cette conversation dans son journal. En r\u00e9ponse, Mme Khan lui a dit de pr\u00e9senter un rapport m\u00e9dical \u00e0 l'appui d'une demande d'accommodement et qu'elle respecterait l'avis du m\u00e9decin. Mme Roopnarine a communiqu\u00e9 avec les Ressources humaines et Oncidium et a re\u00e7u le 11 octobre 2006 les formulaires m\u00e9dicaux que son m\u00e9decin devait remplir. Mme Roopnarine a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 Oncidium l'\u00e9valuation du m\u00e9decin le 17 octobre 2006. L'\u00e9valuation faisait \u00e9tat de douleurs chroniques et aigu\u00ebs au poignet et sugg\u00e9rait que BMO limite \u00e0 quatre heures par jour le temps que Mme Roopnarine passait \u00e0 l'ordinateur. La dur\u00e9e de cet accommodement n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9e. Cependant, il \u00e9tait expliqu\u00e9 dans l'\u00e9valuation que le m\u00e9decin avait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine \u00e0 un neurologue. Mme Roopnarine a trait\u00e9 directement avec Oncidium au sujet de ses douleurs au poignet. Mme Khan n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation de la demande d'accommodement.\n\u00c9valuation de rendement de 2006\n[19] \u00c0 titre de gestionnaire de Mme Roopnarine, Mme Khan devait pr\u00e9parer son \u00e9valuation de rendement de 2006 quant au travail effectu\u00e9 du 1er novembre 2005 au 31 octobre 2006. Mme Khan a suivi la politique de BMO pour pr\u00e9parer l'\u00e9valuation. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine de lui pr\u00e9senter ses commentaires. \u00c0 la mi-octobre 2006, Mme Khan a de nouveau rencontr\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine pour l'aviser qu'elle n'atteignait pas les normes et pour lui donner de l'encadrement afin qu'elle les atteigne.\n[20] Malheureusement, le 19 octobre 2006, Mme Roopnarine a \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans un accident de voiture et a d\u00fb s'absenter du travail en raison des blessures qu'elle a subies lors de cet accident. Elle a touch\u00e9 des prestations d'invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e (ICD). Elle est retourn\u00e9e au travail le 14 novembre 2006. Le 16 novembre 2006, Oncidium a avis\u00e9 Mme Khan que les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux que Mme Roopnarine avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e9taient insuffisants pour qu'elle re\u00e7oive un accommodement pour sa blessure au poignet. Apr\u00e8s son retour au travail, Mme Roopnarine s'est plainte de fa\u00e7on informelle \u00e0 Mme Khan au sujet de son poignet. Mme Khan savait que Mme Roopnarine traitait avec Oncidium au sujet d'un accommodement pour son poignet. Mme Khan attendait des directives de la part d'Oncidium. \u00c0 cette \u00e9poque, Mme Roopnarine traitait directement avec Oncidium et elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son m\u00e9decin d'envoyer \u00e0 la compagnie ses dossiers complets.\n[21] Le 16 novembre 2006, Mme Khan a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine de pr\u00e9parer une auto\u00e9valuation de son rendement. Mme Roopnarine a \u00e9crit une auto\u00e9valuation \u00e9logieuse en utilisant un langage abstrait qui comprenait des phrases telles que [traduction] n\u00e9gocie pour atteindre une situation favorable \u00e0 tous en influen\u00e7ant des strat\u00e9gies personnalis\u00e9es aux situations d'entreprises et en mettant en place des ententes pour atteindre les objectifs des deux parties . Elle n'a pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 sa performance en des termes concrets au sujet du nombre de comptes qu'elle examinait et t\u00e9l\u00e9chargeait, ni dans le volet Gemini ni dans le volet CRDS, et elle n'a pas abord\u00e9 la qualit\u00e9 de ses enqu\u00eates. Son auto\u00e9valuation \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 comprendre et inexacte.\n[22] Mme Khan a aussi consult\u00e9 les anciens gestionnaires de Mme Roopnarine pour \u00e9valuer la premi\u00e8re moiti\u00e9 de l'exercice financier, puisqu'elle n'\u00e9tait gestionnaire que depuis avril 2006. Compte tenu de la r\u00e9troaction qu'elle a obtenue, Mme Khan a \u00e9valu\u00e9 les difficult\u00e9s ant\u00e9rieures de Mme Roopnarine dans le volet Gemini comme suit : [traduction] Tara a eu des probl\u00e8mes avec la pr\u00e9sentation, l'att\u00e9nuation et l'analyse des demandes. Ses demandes ne faisaient [traduction] pas l'objet d'une enqu\u00eate approfondie et il n'y [avait] pas de suivi en temps opportun. Souvent, les demandes [\u00e9taient] plac\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9tape impossible d'att\u00e9nuer , ce qui a caus\u00e9 une perte de client\u00e8le \u00e0 BMO. Malgr\u00e9 l'encadrement, Mme Roopnarine n'a pas pris de [traduction] mesures correctives pour am\u00e9liorer son rendement. Apr\u00e8s avril 2006, Mme Khan a \u00e9valu\u00e9 que malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'elle avait obtenu cinq mois de formation, Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait toujours dans la cat\u00e9gorie en apprentissage du volet CRDS. Elle avait [traduction] de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter l'horaire et les t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements du volet CRDS .\n[23] Essentiellement, Mme Roopnarine ne respectait pas l'horaire de t\u00e9l\u00e9chargement, cr\u00e9ait des probl\u00e8mes techniques, ne traitait pas l'ensemble complet des comptes bancaires et travaillait au hasard plut\u00f4t que syst\u00e9matiquement, comme elle le devait. Par cons\u00e9quent, il y avait des lacunes dans son travail et le travail des quarts suivants en \u00e9tait affect\u00e9. Bien que Mme Roopnarine ait re\u00e7u quelques courriels de f\u00e9licitations au sujet de son travail pendant l'exercice financier, dont deux venaient de Mme Khan, il s'agissait de courriels envoy\u00e9s dans le cadre d'un programme d'encouragement connu sous le nom de Bravo qui ne refl\u00e9tait pas le rendement individuel des employ\u00e9s. Mme Roopnarine n'avait pas acquis les comp\u00e9tences n\u00e9cessaires pour travailler aux volets CRDS et Gemini. Cela allait \u00e0 l'encontre des objectifs de BMO qui visaient \u00e0 s'assurer que tous les analystes pouvaient travailler dans la majorit\u00e9 des volets, permettant ainsi une flexibilit\u00e9 des horaires ainsi qu'une analyse et une connaissance compl\u00e8te du service. Pour cette raison, Mme Khan a \u00e9valu\u00e9 que le travail de Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de ses pairs. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle lui a donn\u00e9 la cote [traduction] contribution inf\u00e9rieure aux attentes .\n[24] Plus tard, Mme Khan a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Coupland pour discuter de l'\u00e9valuation de rendement. Mme Coupland l'a sign\u00e9e le 30 novembre 2006 et a \u00e9crit [traduction] concentrez-vous sur les occasions de d\u00e9veloppement et acceptez l'encadrement [d'un] point de vue positif . Mme Khan a ensuite sign\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2006 et a rencontr\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine le m\u00eame jour, auquel moment elle lui a donn\u00e9 une copie papier de l'\u00e9valuation pour en discuter. Mme Khan avait r\u00e9serv\u00e9 une heure pour discuter de l'\u00e9valuation. Cependant, apr\u00e8s deux minutes, Mme Roopnarine a annonc\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Khan qu'elle ne souhaitait en discuter qu'avec Mme Coupland. Mme Roopnarine a refus\u00e9 de signer l'\u00e9valuation. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle voulait une copie \u00e9lectronique du document. Mme Khan a refus\u00e9 de lui donner de copie \u00e9lectronique parce que Mme Roopnarine avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 modifi\u00e9 et r\u00e9\u00e9crit des portions de courriels qu'elle lui avait envoy\u00e9s. Mme Khan ne voulait pas que son \u00e9valuation originale soit modifi\u00e9e. Mme Khan a accept\u00e9 d'organiser une r\u00e9union avec Mme Coupland.\n[25] Par la suite, les probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Roopnarine ont continu\u00e9. Tout au long de d\u00e9cembre 2006, Mme Khan a continu\u00e9 de recevoir des courriels d'autres gestionnaires qui se plaignaient du rendement de Mme Roopnarine. Par exemple, en d\u00e9cembre 2006, 39 des comptes bancaires de BMO ont \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9s par une attaque frauduleuse, c'est-\u00e0-dire que de l'argent a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9cr\u00e9m\u00e9 dans ces comptes. Pourtant, Mme Roopnarine avait conclu qu'aucun de ces comptes ne n\u00e9cessitait une enqu\u00eate pour fraude possible. Son mauvais rendement s'est poursuivi. Par exemple, \u00e0 la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2006, lors d'une journ\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, elle n'a travaill\u00e9 que 28 minutes dans toute la journ\u00e9e.\nProcessus d'accommodement\n[26] Entre temps, le m\u00e9decin de Mme Roopnarine a envoy\u00e9 un rapport \u00e9crit \u00e0 Oncidium le 27 d\u00e9cembre 2006 dans lequel il r\u00e9sumait la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin de Mme Roopnarine et il mentionnait que le travail de Mme Roopnarine devait \u00eatre modifi\u00e9 afin qu'elle ne travaille que quatre heures par jour avec un clavier et une souris. Le 2 janvier 2007, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u le rapport du m\u00e9decin de Mme Roopnarine, Oncidium a avis\u00e9 BMO qu'il approuvait l'accommodement pour la blessure au poignet de la plaignante pour la p\u00e9riode du 2 janvier 2007 au 4 f\u00e9vrier 2007. Oncidium a aussi avis\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine et BMO que des renseignements suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 jour devaient lui \u00eatre envoy\u00e9s pour justifier un accommodement apr\u00e8s le 4 f\u00e9vrier.\n[27] Mme Khan a imm\u00e9diatement accommod\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine en approuvant une r\u00e9duction de travail \u00e0 l'ordinateur de 7,5 heures \u00e0 4 heures cons\u00e9cutives par jour de travail dans le volet CRDS. Comme l'\u00e9quipe de d\u00e9tection de la fraude \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement informatis\u00e9e, BMO n'a pas offert \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine des t\u00e2ches suppl\u00e9mentaires pour les 3,5 heures restantes, mais elle l'a pay\u00e9e pour la journ\u00e9e enti\u00e8re. De plus, en janvier 2007, BMO a modifi\u00e9 l'horaire de travail de Mme Roopnarine pour lui permettre de se rendre \u00e0 des rendez-vous de physioth\u00e9rapie pour les blessures qu'elle avait subies lors de son accident de voiture.\nRencontre avec Mme Coupland\n[28] Comme Mme Roopnarine l'avait demand\u00e9, le 10 janvier 2007, Mme Coupland et Mme Khan l'ont rencontr\u00e9e pour discuter de l'\u00e9valuation de 2006. Mme Roopnarine a continu\u00e9 de se plaindre au sujet de ses cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es d'emploi et du fait qu'elle n'avait pas obtenu de promotion. Il y a eu tr\u00e8s peu de discussion au sujet de l'\u00e9valuation. Quelques minutes apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la rencontre, Mme Roopnarine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Coupland [traduction] Jamie est une menteuse , en parlant de Mme Khan. Mme Khan et Mme Coupland ont toutes les deux \u00e9t\u00e9 choqu\u00e9es. En cons\u00e9quence, Mme Khan est rest\u00e9e silencieuse pendant le reste de la rencontre. Apr\u00e8s environ une heure de discussion, Mme Coupland s'est impatient\u00e9e et a dit \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine d'en [traduction] venir \u00e0 l'objet de la rencontre, en pointant la table. Apr\u00e8s la rencontre, Mme Coupland a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine dans lequel elle d\u00e9clarait [traduction] votre comportement lors de notre rencontre aujourd'hui, lorsque vous avez accus\u00e9e Jamie d'\u00eatre une menteuse, \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement inacceptable. Vous n'avez formul\u00e9 aucune excuse au cours de la rencontre. Jamie a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps avec vous depuis son arriv\u00e9e au poste de gestionnaire et elle a fait preuve d'une patience extraordinaire envers vous, au point o\u00f9 elle a pass\u00e9 moins de temps avec les autres membres de votre \u00e9quipe. Mme Coupland a ajout\u00e9 que Mme Roopnarine continuait de regarder vers le pass\u00e9 et continuait de bl\u00e2mer les autres pour son propre rendement. Ces comportements avaient constitu\u00e9 90 p. 100 de la rencontre.\n[29] Le m\u00eame jour, Mme Roopnarine a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 \u00e0 la gestionnaire de Mme Coupland, Mme Penny, pour lui demander de la rencontrer. Entre temps, Mme Khan, malgr\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 accus\u00e9e d'\u00eatre une menteuse, a continu\u00e9 de traiter Mme Roopnarine de fa\u00e7on positive et utile.\n[30] Cependant, comme Mme Roopnarine ne s'est jamais excus\u00e9e de son comportement, ni pendant la rencontre, ni apr\u00e8s le courriel de Mme Coupland, cette derni\u00e8re et Mme Penny ont pris la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l'emploi de Mme Roopnarine. Les politiques d'emploi du BMO permettaient le cong\u00e9diement soit pour un motif suffisant ou avec un avis et une indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi en guise de pr\u00e9avis. Les politiques disciplinaires comprenaient une approche en plusieurs \u00e9tapes pour les cong\u00e9diements pour motif suffisant, mais donnaient aux gestionnaires un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour le cong\u00e9diement sans pr\u00e9avis dans certains cas. Comme Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e de longue date et qu'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 difficile de la cong\u00e9dier pour un motif suffisant, au sens l\u00e9gal du terme, BMO a choisi de la cong\u00e9dier en lui donnant une indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi et une indemnit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9avis.\n[31] Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2007, juste avant la date de cong\u00e9diement, Oncidium a avis\u00e9 Mme Khan qu'aucun autre document m\u00e9dical n'avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 l'appui d'une prolongation d'accommodement apr\u00e8s le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2007 et que la compagnie attendait un rapport m\u00e9dical puisqu'elle savait que Mme Roopnarine devait avoir un rendez-vous avec un sp\u00e9cialiste dans un avenir rapproch\u00e9.\n[32] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2007, Mme Coupland a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine et lui a envoy\u00e9 une lettre de cong\u00e9diement qui portait la date du jour m\u00eame. Mme Khan n'a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision. La lettre de Mme Coupland pr\u00e9cisait que [traduction] la pr\u00e9sente confirme que votre emploi \u00e0 la BMO prendra fin, avec indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi, en date du 15 f\u00e9vrier 2007 . Comme il l'\u00e9tait mentionn\u00e9 dans la lettre, BMO a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine une indemnit\u00e9 de maintien de salaire pour 95 semaines, du 16 f\u00e9vrier 2007 au 12 d\u00e9cembre 2008. La valeur du versement de salaire \u00e9tait de 86 955 $. Mme Roopnarine a aussi re\u00e7u un paiement de 2 952 $, qui repr\u00e9sentait la prime de rendement correspondant \u00e0 son indemnit\u00e9 de maintien de salaire. Ce montant devait \u00eatre pay\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de maintien de salaire. Ses avantages sociaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 maintenus, ainsi que ses cotisations \u00e0 son fonds de pension, pendant les 95 semaines et elle a eu droit \u00e0 des services de consultation aux fins du replacement.\nApr\u00e8s le cong\u00e9diement\n[33] Mme Roopnarine a vu le neurologue en janvier 2007. Le neurologue a envoy\u00e9 son rapport, dat\u00e9 du 13 mars 2007, \u00e0 Oncidium vers la fin mars. Le rapport confirmait qu'elle souffrait de microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s et qu'il n'y avait aucun signe de syndrome du canal carpien.\n[34] Mme Roopnarine a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 impliqu\u00e9e dans un deuxi\u00e8me accident de voiture le 19 avril 2007. Elle a intent\u00e9 une poursuite civile contre le propri\u00e9taire et conducteur d'un autre v\u00e9hicule impliqu\u00e9 dans la collision, dans laquelle poursuite elle demandait des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats de 1 500 000 $ (600 000 $ en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et 900 000 $ en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux). Elle soutenait qu'elle avait subi des blessures physiques importantes.\n[35] En date de l'audience, soit le 25 janvier 2010, Mme Roopnarine n'avait pas encore trouv\u00e9 d'emploi depuis son cong\u00e9diement de BMO. Elle a tent\u00e9 d'att\u00e9nuer sa perte de salaire en se cherchant un autre emploi.\nB. Les faits non contest\u00e9s et l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice [36] Gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une active gestion pr\u00e9paratoire \u00e0 l'audience et une exploration des questions avec les avocats au d\u00e9but de l'audience, les avocats ont convenu d'un certain nombre de faits. Cette entente au sujet des faits a acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 le processus d'audience et a probablement entra\u00een\u00e9 une r\u00e9duction des co\u00fbts des parties en ce qui a trait aux frais juridiques. Ceci est particuli\u00e8rement important compte tenu de l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Mowat, 2009 CAF 309, dans lequel la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le Tribunal n'a pas comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des frais juridiques au plaignant qui obtient gain de cause, et compte tenu du fait qu'il n'existe aucune disposition portant sur l'attribution de frais juridiques aux intim\u00e9s ou aux plaignants qui n'obtiennent pas gain de cause. L'entente a aussi permis au Tribunal de pr\u00e9ciser la teneur de l'audience et de r\u00e9duire le nombre de questions \u00e0 trancher. De plus, la preuve m\u00e9dicale du m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste et du neurologue a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e sans que des assignations \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner ne soient envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 ces m\u00e9decins, qui \u00e9taient r\u00e9ticents \u00e0 l'id\u00e9e de participer \u00e0 l'audience, ce qui a aussi \u00e9conomis\u00e9 des frais aux parties, qui auraient probablement eu \u00e0 couvrir les frais n\u00e9cessaires pour que les m\u00e9decins t\u00e9moignent. L'affidavit du m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Roopnarine a plut\u00f4t \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour \u00e9tablir la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son contenu et BMO a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de contre-interroger le m\u00e9decin. Enfin, les parties ont convenu que seulement deux t\u00e9moins compara\u00eetraient : Mme Roopnarine et Mme Khan.\nC. D\u00e9saccord au sujet des questions de fait [37] En arrivant aux conclusions de fait ci-dessus, j'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement toute la preuve. Il y avait des divergences surprenantes entre le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Roopnarine et celui de Mme Khan au sujet des questions de rendement, du comportement de Mme Roopnarine et du cong\u00e9diement. J'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'accepter le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Khan lorsqu'il y avait divergence avec le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Roopnarine pour diff\u00e9rentes raisons. Malgr\u00e9 le contre-interrogatoire long et exhaustif de l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine, Mme Khan est rest\u00e9e calme et franche. En g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, j'ai trouv\u00e9 que Mme Khan \u00e9tait sinc\u00e8re, claire et coh\u00e9rente. Elle \u00e9tait juste et \u00e9quilibr\u00e9e. Par exemple, elle a reconnu que Mme Roopnarine lui avait parl\u00e9 de ses douleurs au poignet en novembre 2006. J'ai remarqu\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Khan concordait avec la preuve documentaire. Elle a fait preuve d'ind\u00e9pendance en ce sens que, bien qu'elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 la gestionnaire de Mme Roopnarine et qu'elle ait \u00e9valu\u00e9 son rendement en de\u00e7\u00e0 des attentes, elle n'a pas pris la d\u00e9cision finale de la cong\u00e9dier. Cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par sa gestionnaire, Mme Coupland. J'ai aussi remarqu\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moignage ne faisait \u00e9tat d'aucune agitation ou hostilit\u00e9 envers Mme Roopnarine, lorsqu'elle a expliqu\u00e9 comment Mme Roopnarine l'avait qualifi\u00e9e de menteuse . Dans l'ensemble, j'ai conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Khan \u00e9tait compl\u00e8tement coh\u00e9rent.\n[38] Cependant, j'ai eu de la difficult\u00e9 avec le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Roopnarine pour diverses raisons. M. McKillop est un avocat comp\u00e9tent et j'ai trouv\u00e9 que son contre-interrogatoire de Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait juste et respectueux. Il lui a constamment donn\u00e9 l'occasion de modifier son t\u00e9moignage et il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de r\u00e9els efforts pour comprendre son t\u00e9moignage et s'assurer qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re inexacte. Pourtant, Mme Roopnarine a souvent refus\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre franchement \u00e0 des questions banales, en ne r\u00e9pondant que par oui ou non . Par exemple, lorsqu'on lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa description d'emploi, elle a refus\u00e9 de confirmer qu'il s'agissait bien des t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 son poste jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on lui demande de nombreuses fois. Elle a refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre que le fait qu'elle signale qu'une demande d'hypoth\u00e8que \u00e9tait possiblement frauduleuse entra\u00eenait le rejet de cette demande, jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'on lui pose de nombreuses questions \u00e0 ce sujet. Elle a agi de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9serv\u00e9e et d\u00e9fensive tout au long du contre-interrogatoire. Elle a finalement reconnu qu'elle n'avait avis\u00e9 Mme Khan de sa blessure au poignet qu'en octobre 2006. \u00c0 la fin du contre-interrogatoire, elle a reconnu que ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement en 2004 et en 2005, ainsi que ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement dans le volet Gemini pendant les six premiers mois de 2006, n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa blessure au poignet.\n[39] J'ai aussi remarqu\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Roopnarine comportait de nombreuses incoh\u00e9rences. Par exemple, elle a modifi\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage de nombreuses fois en contre-interrogatoire, apr\u00e8s qu'on lui a donn\u00e9 l'occasion de le faire. Elle a ni\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u beaucoup de formation pour le volet CRDS et, lorsqu'on lui a montr\u00e9 les notes d\u00e9taill\u00e9es de la formation de quatre semaines donn\u00e9e en mai 2006 \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues, elle a finalement accept\u00e9 qu'elle avait re\u00e7u une partie de cette formation. Elle ne se souvenait pas avoir re\u00e7u une partie de la formation et elle a ni\u00e9 avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 une grande partie de la formation. J'ai compar\u00e9 ce t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 celui de Mme Khan au sujet du fait que la formation a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, t\u00e9moignage qui co\u00efncidait avec les notes du formateur d\u00e9crivant les instructions concr\u00e8tes qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es. Pour une autre question, Mme Roopnarine a ni\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9contente de l'\u00e9valuation de rendement de 2006, m\u00eame si elle s'en est plainte aupr\u00e8s de Mme Coupland, puis de Mme Penny.\n[40] Mme Roopnarine a d'abord ni\u00e9, dans son t\u00e9moignage en interrogatoire principal et en contre-interrogatoire, qu'elle avait eu des probl\u00e8mes de rendement. Puis, plus tard en contre-interrogatoire, elle a reconnu qu'elle avait fait des erreurs en 2004. Cependant, elle a imm\u00e9diatement insist\u00e9 sur la diff\u00e9rence entre insouciance et erreur . Elle a d'abord ni\u00e9 avec v\u00e9h\u00e9mence le fait qu'elle ait pu avoir des probl\u00e8mes de rendement depuis 2004. M. McKillop lui a fait le r\u00e9cit de 25 incidents et, en contre-interrogatoire, elle en a reconnu une partie. Par exemple, elle avait sign\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuation de rendement de 2005 et avait accept\u00e9 qu'elle devait am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences pour satisfaire aux normes de base du service. Au d\u00e9part, elle a ni\u00e9 le fait qu'elle ne respectait pas les directives et la proc\u00e9dure, mais elle a ensuite reconnu ce fait. Apr\u00e8s un interrogatoire intensif, elle a finalement reconnu qu'elle avait accept\u00e9 la recommandation de son formateur en juin 2006 selon laquelle elle devait se concentrer sur son travail dans le volet CRDS pour maintenir une constance dans les t\u00e9l\u00e9chargements et l'envoi d'alertes. Elle a finalement accept\u00e9 qu'on l'a avis\u00e9e, en juin 2006, qu'elle avait fait glisser un fichier ma\u00eetre du volet CRDS dans le mauvais dossier, mais a ni\u00e9 que cela avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes importants pour ses coll\u00e8gues, qui ne pouvaient pas y avoir acc\u00e8s. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me technique avait \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9 en 15 \u00e0 20 minutes par le service de TI, alors que Mme Khan a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le probl\u00e8me avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solu apr\u00e8s une journ\u00e9e et demie.\n[41] De fa\u00e7on plus importante, Mme Roopnarine a ni\u00e9 avoir qualifi\u00e9 Mme Khan de menteuse, malgr\u00e9 le fait que Mme Coupland avait envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 Mme Penny, courriel dont une copie conforme avait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Khan peu apr\u00e8s la rencontre et dont une copie papier avait \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine. Elle n'a pas prouv\u00e9 que le courriel n'\u00e9tait pas fiable. En contre-interrogatoire, Mme Roopnarine a d'abord refus\u00e9 de reconna\u00eetre que le fait de qualifier un gestionnaire de menteur \u00e9tait grave, mais elle a ensuite admis qu'un tel comportement serait inacceptable.\n[42] Elle a exag\u00e9r\u00e9 son t\u00e9moignage. Par exemple, elle a sous-entendu qu'elle \u00e9tait responsable de la cr\u00e9ation d'une partie du processus dans le volet Gemini, alors qu'il n'existait aucune preuve qu'une personne de son niveau ait pu participer \u00e0 la conception. Un autre point qui m'a frapp\u00e9e est son auto\u00e9valuation \u00e9logieuse de 2006 : elle a utilis\u00e9 un niveau de langue soutenu et abstrait pour d\u00e9crire son travail, plut\u00f4t que de pr\u00e9senter des exemples concrets de ses comp\u00e9tences. Je suis d'avis que cet effort de donner une allure positive \u00e0 son rendement \u00e9tait malhonn\u00eate. J'ai aussi eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 croire qu'elle n'avait pas vu sa d\u00e9claration pour son action au civil, au sujet de son accident survenu en avril 2007, et qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas au courant de l'\u00e9tat de cette action. D'ailleurs, lors d'une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire \u00e0 l'audience, j'avais demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine, en sa pr\u00e9sence, de communiquer avec l'avocat qu'elle avait retenu pour son action au civil afin d'obtenir et de pr\u00e9senter les documents pertinents. Dans l'ensemble, j'ai conclu que Mme Roopnarine n'\u00e9tait pas cr\u00e9dible. J'ai relev\u00e9 de nombreuses incoh\u00e9rences dans son t\u00e9moignage.\nD. Nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au sujet de compressions [43] L'avocat de Mme Roopnarine n'avait pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 d'argumentation \u00e9crite \u00e0 la fin de l'audience et a demand\u00e9 l'occasion de d\u00e9poser des observations \u00e9crites. J'ai accept\u00e9. Dans ces observations et dans des courriels, l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine a soutenu que M. McKillop ne pouvait pas soutenir que Mme Roopnarine avait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une politique de BMO de cong\u00e9dier les employ\u00e9s dont le rendement \u00e9tait mauvais, compte tenu de la situation \u00e9conomique, parce que cet argument n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de BMO. Je conviens avec l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine que l'argument des compressions n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois qu'\u00e0 l'audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n'accorde aucun poids \u00e0 cet aspect de l'argumentation de BMO.\nE. Le rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission [44] En l'esp\u00e8ce, le rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sur consentement. Bien que les arguments de l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine \u00e9taient fond\u00e9s sur des conclusions de fait et des conclusions tir\u00e9es du rapport d'enqu\u00eate de la Commission, je n'accorde aucun poids aux conclusions de fait et aux conclusions de la Commission. Je me fonde sur la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience.\nIII. LE DROIT A. \u00c9tablissement d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination [45] L'article 7 de la Loi dispose que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait de refuser d'employer ou de continuer d'employer un individu. La d\u00e9ficience fait partie de la liste des motifs de discrimination illicites \u00e9tablie \u00e0 l'article 3 de la Loi. Selon l'article 25, d\u00e9ficience , aux fins de l'application de la Loi, signifie [...] d\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu'elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l'alcool ou la drogue .\n[46] Dans une affaire portant sur les droits de la personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination. La preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la partie plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. La r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9 ne devrait pas \u00eatre prise en compte dans la d\u00e9cision \u00e0 savoir si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination. (Voir Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne) et O'Malley c. Simpson Sears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, et Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd., 2004 CAF 204.) Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 que les affirmations du plaignant doivent \u00eatre cr\u00e9dibles pour qu'on autorise la conclusion selon laquelle il existait une preuve prima facie, Dhanjal c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), (1997) 139 F.T.R. 37, au paragraphe 6).\nB. R\u00e9ponse [47] Une fois que la preuve prima facie de discrimination est \u00e9tablie, le fardeau de la preuve incombe par la suite \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9, qui doit montrer que l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne s'est pas produit tel qu'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ou que l'acte \u00e9tait d'une mani\u00e8re ou d'une autre non discriminatoire ou justifi\u00e9. (Maillet c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 48, au paragraphe 4; LCDP, article 15.). Voir aussi Canada c. Lambie, 1996 CanLii 3940 (C.F.). Lorsqu'on examine une action, plut\u00f4t qu'une transaction d\u00e9coulant d'une politique existante, il faut commencer par examiner si la transaction entre les parties, dans son ensemble, entra\u00eene un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur des motifs de distinction illicites (Hutchinson c. Canada (Ministre de l'Environnement) (C.A.), 2003 CAF 133, [2003] 4 C.F. 580). Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit l'unique raison de l'acte reproch\u00e9 pour qu'une plainte soit accueillie. Il suffit que la discrimination ne soit que l'une des raisons de l'acte ou de la d\u00e9cision. (Holden c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (1990), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12 (C.A.F.).)\nC. La preuve [48] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet la difficult\u00e9 d'\u00e9tablir des all\u00e9gations de discrimination au moyen d'une preuve directe. Comme le Tribunal l'a not\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada (1988), 9 C.H.R.R. D\/5029 (T.C.D.P.), la discrimination n'est pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste ouvertement, comme on serait port\u00e9 \u00e0 le croire. Il est rare en effet qu'on puisse d\u00e9montrer par des preuves directes qu'un acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis intentionnellement. On doit plut\u00f4t tenir compte de l'ensemble des circonstances afin de d\u00e9terminer s'il existe de subtiles odeurs de discrimination.\n[49] Essentiellement, cependant, la plaignante en l'esp\u00e8ce doit \u00e9tablir un lien entre sa d\u00e9ficience et la d\u00e9cision de l'employeur de la cong\u00e9dier (Mills c. Culp Transport Inc. 2009 TCDP 17). (Voir aussi Benoit c. Bell Canada, 2005 CF 926, aux paragraphes 15 et 16).\nIV. Analyse A. Mme Roopnarine a-t-elle \u00e9tabli qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination? (i) Licenciement a) Preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie [50] BMO a reconnu qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque du cong\u00e9diement, Mme Roopnarine souffrait d'une d\u00e9ficience, soit sa blessure au poignet caus\u00e9e par des microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, et qu'un rapport de sp\u00e9cialiste visant le prolongement de la p\u00e9riode d'accommodement devait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sous peu. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 ses autres blessures, Mme Roopnarine n'a pas pr\u00e9tendu qu'elle n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accommod\u00e9e pour les blessures qu'elle a subies lors de son accident de voiture du 19 octobre 2006. En effet, elle a reconnu qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 et qu'elle avait re\u00e7u des prestations d'ICD. Dans ses observations \u00e9crites, l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine a mentionn\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait bless\u00e9e au cou, aux \u00e9paules, \u00e0 la main et aux doigts lorsqu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e. Cependant, la seule preuve m\u00e9dicale pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Roopnarine ne portait que sur ses blessures \u00e0 la main et au poignet. Lors des conf\u00e9rences pr\u00e9paratoires \u00e0 l'audience, les deux avocats ont convenu que la seule blessure en question pour l'audience \u00e9tait la blessure au poignet caus\u00e9e par des microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s.\n[51] L'argument fondamental de Mme Roopnarine, tel qu'\u00e9tabli dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au d\u00e9but de l'audience, est que BMO l'a cong\u00e9di\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on soudaine et inattendue alors qu'elle souffrait d'une blessure au poignet, qu'elle \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d'accommodement pour cette blessure, qu'elle faisait de la physioth\u00e9rapie pour soigner sa d\u00e9ficience et qu'elle attendait un rapport d'un sp\u00e9cialiste pour que la p\u00e9riode d'accommodement soit prolong\u00e9e. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque de son cong\u00e9diement, elle souffrait de douleurs caus\u00e9es par des microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s. Aucune analyse fonctionnelle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e.\n[52] Comme BMO n'a r\u00e9ellement contest\u00e9 aucun de ces faits, je conclus que Mme Roopnarine a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience.\nb) Explication raisonnable, qui n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte, \u00e9tablie [53] Cependant, je conclus que BMO a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une explication raisonnable qui n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte pour le cong\u00e9diement. La blessure au poignet de Mme Roopnarine n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier. Mme Roopnarine \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t une employ\u00e9e difficile qui croyait qu'elle avait droit \u00e0 une promotion et \u00e0 une augmentation de salaire en raison de ses ann\u00e9es de services et de son \u00e9chelon salarial. Elle avait pour objectif d'\u00eatre promue \u00e0 un poste d'enqu\u00eateure principale en mati\u00e8re de fraude. Cependant, elle ne voulait pas atteindre les normes de base pour le poste d'analyste subalterne en mati\u00e8re de fraude, ou elle en \u00e9tait incapable. Elle ne voulait ou ne pouvait pas ma\u00eetriser les comp\u00e9tences de base du volet CRDS. Elle refusait d'accepter la critique constructive. Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Roopnarine a tent\u00e9 de retourner au volet Gemini, o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait plus difficile de remarquer ses lacunes en mati\u00e8re de rendement. M\u00eame dans le volet Gemini, elle n'avait pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 effectuer des \u00e9valuations compl\u00e8tes et satisfaisantes des demandes d'hypoth\u00e8ques et elle avait besoin de formation suppl\u00e9mentaire pour y arriver. Elle a refus\u00e9 de signer son \u00e9valuation de rendement de 2006. Elle a refus\u00e9 de discuter de ses lacunes avec Mme Khan. Elle a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une plainte \u00e0 la gestionnaire de Mme Khan. Abruptement, elle a ouvert la rencontre en d\u00e9clarant [traduction] Jamie est une menteuse , en parlant de Mme Khan. M\u00eame si la rencontre a dur\u00e9 une heure, elle ne s'est jamais excus\u00e9e, \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0 ou apr\u00e8s, pour cette remarque. Mme Khan avait trait\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine avec une patience perp\u00e9tuelle et lui avait offert du soutien personnel quotidien, ainsi que de la formation continue et exhaustive. Mme Coupland a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que BMO ne tol\u00e9rerait pas un tel manque de respect de la part d'un employ\u00e9 envers un gestionnaire comp\u00e9tent, sympathique et intelligent. Je conclus que cette d\u00e9cision n'\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire.\n[54] Tout au long de son emploi, BMO a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Roopnarine de la r\u00e9troaction au sujet de son rendement.\n[55] En raison du comportement de Mme Roopnarine lors de la rencontre du 10 janvier 2007, ainsi que de ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement et de sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 respecter les proc\u00e9dures, BMO a choisi de la cong\u00e9dier. Comme elle \u00e9tait une employ\u00e9e de longue date, BMO a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui donner un avis et une indemnit\u00e9 de cessation d'emploi.\n[56] Les probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Roopnarine n'\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa blessure au poignet et \u00e9taient ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 celle-ci. Mme Roopnarine a voulu retourner au volet Gemini, o\u00f9 son mauvais rendement \u00e9tait plus difficile \u00e0 \u00e9valuer. Elle ne souhaitait pas y retourner parce que l'utilisation du clavier y \u00e9tait moindre et parce qu'un tel accommodement \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour sa blessure au poignet. Bien qu'il ait pu y avoir une utilisation moins importante du clavier dans le volet Gemini, la preuve n'est pas suffisante pour d\u00e9montrer que le transfert au volet Gemini \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire comme mesure d'accommodement pour la blessure au poignet. Le m\u00e9decin de famille de Mme Roopnarine n'a pas demand\u00e9 un tel accommodement. BMO a respect\u00e9 les mesures d'accommodement recommand\u00e9es par le m\u00e9decin de Mme Roopnarine dans le volet CRDS.\n[57] BMO a accept\u00e9 sa responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'accommodement envers Mme Roopnarine. En effet, BMO a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour elle apr\u00e8s son accident de voiture du 19 octobre 2006. En raison de probl\u00e8mes m\u00e9dicaux d\u00e9coulant de cet accident, elle s'est absent\u00e9e du travail et a re\u00e7u des prestations d'ICD. En janvier 2007, BMO a modifi\u00e9 l'horaire de travail de Mme Roopnarine afin de lui permettre de se rendre \u00e0 des rendez-vous de physioth\u00e9rapie pour traiter ses blessures subies lors de l'accident de voiture. Rien ne porte \u00e0 croire que les efforts d'accommodement de BMO en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'accident de voiture \u00e9taient insuffisants. Du 2 janvier 2007 jusqu'\u00e0 la date de cong\u00e9diement, BMO a pris des mesures d'accommodement pour la blessure au poignet de Mme Roopnarine en r\u00e9duisant \u00e0 quatre heures par jour son temps d'utilisation d'un ordinateur, comme le m\u00e9decin l'avait recommand\u00e9. De plus, le comportement de Mme Khan et de Mme Coupland n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 par le processus d'\u00e9valuation d'Oncidium.\n[58] Il ne s'agit pas non plus en l'esp\u00e8ce d'un cas o\u00f9 il faut d\u00e9terminer si Mme Roopnarine avait les capacit\u00e9s physiques lui permettant d'effectuer son travail. Ses capacit\u00e9s physiques n'ont jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de BMO de la cong\u00e9dier. Les seuls facteurs dans cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9taient son rendement et son comportement.\n[59] Bref, je conclus que le comportement de BMO et son explication pour le cong\u00e9diement sont raisonnables et ne sont pas li\u00e9s \u00e0 la blessure au poignet de Mme Roopnarine; ils \u00e9taient de bonne foi et n'\u00e9taient pas un pr\u00e9texte. J'ai examin\u00e9 attentivement la preuve pour y relever l'odeur subtile de la discrimination, afin de d\u00e9terminer si BMO a utilis\u00e9 le mauvais rendement de Mme Roopnarine comme pr\u00e9texte pour la cong\u00e9dier et afin de d\u00e9terminer si les probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Roopnarine \u00e9taient caus\u00e9s ou aggrav\u00e9s par sa blessure au poignet. Ni l'un ni l'autre n'\u00e9tait le cas en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il n'est pas interdit \u00e0 un employeur de cong\u00e9dier un employ\u00e9 ayant une d\u00e9ficience pour des motifs non discriminatoires, comme le mauvais rendement qui n'est pas li\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9ficience. (Voir Crouse c. Canadian Steamship Lines Inc., 2001 CanLII 8493 (T.C.D.P.) et Coulter c. Purolator Courier Ltd., 2004 TCDP 37. Voir aussi Desormeaux c. Ottawa, 2005 CAF, 311.) Compte tenu de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, les limites physiques de Mme Roopnarine n'ont jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de BMO de la cong\u00e9dier.\n(ii) Traitement diff\u00e9rent pr\u00e9judiciable en milieu de travail a) Aucune preuve prima facie \u00e9tablie [60] La plainte de Mme Roopnarine portait sur le licenciement et sur la fa\u00e7on dont le comportement qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 celui-ci a entra\u00een\u00e9 un cong\u00e9diement discriminatoire. Mme Roopnarine n'a pas soutenu dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu'elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d'un traitement diff\u00e9rent pr\u00e9judiciable avant son cong\u00e9diement. Cependant, j'ai mentionn\u00e9 cette p\u00e9riode aux deux avocats \u00e0 l'audience. Comme ils n'arrivaient pas \u00e0 s'entendre \u00e0 ce sujet, j'ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d'aborder cette question dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision afin d'en assurer l'int\u00e9gralit\u00e9.\n[61] Je ne conclus pas que Mme Roopnarine a \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination pour la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant son cong\u00e9diement, soit \u00e0 partir du mois d'octobre 2006. L'alin\u00e9a 7b) interdit le traitement diff\u00e9rent en milieu de travail. Pour d\u00e9terminer s'il y a eu acte discriminatoire, la perception ou la conviction de Mme Roopnarine n'est pas suffisante : Filgueira c. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2005 TCDP 32, au par. 41, conf. 2006 CF 785.\n[62] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 toute la preuve pour y relever l'odeur subtile de discrimination, je conclus que BMO n'a pas agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers Mme Roopnarine pendant son emploi et apr\u00e8s qu'elle ait avis\u00e9 Mme Khan de sa blessure au poignet, le 5 octobre 2006. Au contraire, Mme Khan a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 tous les efforts pour l'aider \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences afin de faciliter ses futures possibilit\u00e9s d'avancement de carri\u00e8re. Les probl\u00e8mes de rendement de Mme Roopnarine et son comportement \u00e9taient une pr\u00e9occupation pour BMO depuis 2004. Mme Roopnarine a refus\u00e9 d'accepter la critique et les directives et, malgr\u00e9 avoir re\u00e7u de la formation, elle n'a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s'am\u00e9liorer dans un poste de niveau d'entr\u00e9e dans le volet CRDS. Selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, sa blessure au poignet d'octobre 2006 n'a jou\u00e9 aucun r\u00f4le dans les efforts continus de Mme Khan de l'aider et de lui donner des directives.\n[63] Pendant l'audience, j'ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 aux avocats si la demande d'Oncidium visant l'obtention de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9tait une question r\u00e9elle en l'esp\u00e8ce. L'avocat de Mme Roopnarine a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'il s'agissait d'une question r\u00e9elle en ce sens que BMO aurait raisonnablement d\u00fb savoir que Mme Roopnarine avait une d\u00e9ficience depuis mai 2006, du moins depuis octobre 2006, que des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux suppl\u00e9mentaires n'auraient pas d\u00fb \u00eatre demand\u00e9s et que BMO aurait d\u00fb prendre des mesures d'accommodement plus t\u00f4t. Malgr\u00e9 les observations orales de l'avocat de Mme Roopnarine, la question n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Roopnarine. BMO a toujours cru que l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce portait sur le cong\u00e9diement et a exprim\u00e9 de la surprise lors de la communication tardive de cette question. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle ne m'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e correctement. Contrairement \u00e0 l'avis de son avocat, Mme Roopnarine a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle \u00e9tait satisfaite du processus de communication d'Oncidium.\n[64] De plus, le processus d'accommodement de BMO correspondait \u00e0 son devoir d'accommoder un employ\u00e9 qui d\u00e9clare avoir une d\u00e9ficience. La plaignante avait le devoir de faciliter son accommodement, devoir qui comprenait l'obligation de se conformer \u00e0 la demande raisonnable de l'employeur de fournir des renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents : Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 TCDP 8. D\u00e8s qu'Oncidium a re\u00e7u le rapport m\u00e9dical, la compagnie a transmis les renseignements aux employ\u00e9s de BMO, qui ont mis en place les mesures d'accommodement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es par le m\u00e9decin de Mme Roopnarine. (Voir aussi Wong c. Banque Royale du Canada, 2001 CanLII 8499 (T.C.D.P.))\n[65] Oncidium et BMO ont agi de bonne foi dans leurs interactions avec Mme Roopnarine.\n[66] Mme Roopnarine a soutenu \u00e0 l'audience et dans ses observations \u00e9crites pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es apr\u00e8s l'audience qu'Oncidium avait unilat\u00e9ralement impos\u00e9 la date d'expiration du 4 f\u00e9vrier 2007 pour la p\u00e9riode d'accommodement. Je ne crois pas que cette restriction \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable compte tenu du fait que le m\u00e9decin de Mme Roopnarine avait confirm\u00e9 dans son rapport du 17 octobre 2006 qu'elle devait voir un sp\u00e9cialiste. Comme sa lettre du 27 d\u00e9cembre 2006 a confirm\u00e9 que Mme Roopnarine avait un rendez-vous avec le sp\u00e9cialiste le 18 janvier 2007, il n'\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9raisonnable qu'Oncidium s'attende \u00e0 recevoir le rapport avant le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2007 afin de d\u00e9terminer si l'accommodement devait se poursuivre. De plus, cette question n'a aucune incidence en l'esp\u00e8ce puisque BMO n'a pas mis fin \u00e0 l'accommodement le 4 f\u00e9vrier 2007, mais a plut\u00f4t continu\u00e9 d'accommoder Mme Roopnarine jusqu'\u00e0 son cong\u00e9diement.\n[67] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gation de Mme Roopnarine selon laquelle BMO n'a pas effectu\u00e9 d'analyse fonctionnelle avant de la cong\u00e9dier, j'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que BMO ne l'avait pas cong\u00e9di\u00e9e en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, mais plut\u00f4t en raison de son mauvais rendement et de son comportement.\n[68] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 son argument selon lequel BMO aurait d\u00fb la transf\u00e9rer au volet Gemini, o\u00f9 elle aurait eu un meilleur accommodement pour sa blessure au poignet, la preuve m\u00e9dicale ne permet pas d'\u00e9tablir qu'un retour au volet Gemini l'aurait aid\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9duire sa douleur au poignet. Son m\u00e9decin a restreint son utilisation prolong\u00e9e de la souris et du clavier, d\u00e9finissant utilisation prolong\u00e9e comme une utilisation de plus de quatre heures. Mme Khan a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, pour des raisons de gestion raisonnables, que Mme Roopnarine devait parfaire ses comp\u00e9tences au niveau d'entr\u00e9e dans le volet CRDS et elle a accommod\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine de fa\u00e7on raisonnable dans son poste au CRDS en respectant les restrictions. Mme Roopnarine a continu\u00e9 \u00e0 demander d'\u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au volet Gemini parce qu'elle ne r\u00e9ussissait pas dans le volet CRDS et que son travail \u00e9tait plus difficile \u00e0 surveiller dans le volet Gemini. Comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, sa demande d'\u00eatre retourn\u00e9e au volet Gemini n'\u00e9tait pas une demande d'accommodement pour sa blessure au poignet.\n[69] \u00c0 partir du 2 janvier 2007, Mme Roopnarine n'a travaill\u00e9 que quatre heures par jour, qui en comptait normalement 7,5. BMO lui payait son salaire pour les trois heures o\u00f9 elle ne travaillait pas. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'argument de Mme Roopnarine selon lequel BMO aurait d\u00fb lui donner du travail non informatis\u00e9 suppl\u00e9mentaire pour le reste de la journ\u00e9e, le rapport m\u00e9dical ne mentionnait pas un tel accommodement. Il y \u00e9tait seulement pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu'elle ne devait pas utiliser un clavier et une souris pendant plus de quatre heures par jour. Mme Roopnarine n'a pas avis\u00e9 BMO, avant l'audience, qu'elle souhaitait que ces quatre heures de travail soient \u00e9tal\u00e9es sur la journ\u00e9e compl\u00e8te de 7,5 heures. Elle a ainsi manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation d'aviser BMO de l'accommodement qu'elle souhaitait obtenir et de pr\u00e9senter les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux pertinents pour cette demande. (Voir Tweten c. RTL Robinson Enterprises Ltd., 2005 TCDP 8.) De plus, bien que le processus d'accommodement soit personnalis\u00e9, la plaignante ne peut pas s'attendre \u00e0 une solution parfaite : Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill (H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al) c. Syndicat des employ\u00e9s de l'H\u00f4pital g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Montr\u00e9al, 2007 CSC 4, [2007] 1 R.C.S. 161, au paragraphe 22. On ne ma pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de jurisprudence \u00e0 lappui de largument selon lequel BMO avait une obligation en vertu de la LCDP de cr\u00e9er du travail pour la plaignante.\n[70] Enfin, Mme Roopnarine a soutenu que BMO n'avait mentionn\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes de rendement qu'apr\u00e8s qu'elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle souffrait d'une blessure au poignet. Cette all\u00e9gation est contraire \u00e0 la preuve selon laquelle Mme Roopnarine avait des probl\u00e8mes de rendement qui inqui\u00e9taient BMO depuis 2004 et que ces probl\u00e8mes se sont poursuivis jusqu'\u00e0 la date de cong\u00e9diement. Mme Khan a agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable et patiente avec Mme Roopnarine dans toutes leurs interactions. Elle \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement pr\u00eate \u00e0 aider Mme Roopnarine en prenant des mesures d'accommodement. Elle lui a donn\u00e9 de la r\u00e9troaction constructive et de la formation continue pour l'aider \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer ses comp\u00e9tences. Je n'accepte pas l'argument selon lequel Mme Coupland a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers Mme Roopnarine.\nb) Explication raisonnable \u00e9tablie [71] M\u00eame si la preuve a permis d'\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, BMO a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une explication raisonnable qui n'est pas un pr\u00e9texte pour ses actions d'octobre 2006 jusqu'au cong\u00e9diement, comme je l'ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t.\nc) Aucun droit distinct \u00e0 l'accommodement [72] Enfin, la plaignante ne peut pas soulever un argument distinct selon lequel BMO a agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en ne prenant pas de mesures d'accommodement pour sa blessure au poignet. Le d\u00e9faut de prendre des mesures d'accommodement n'est ni un motif de distinction illicite ni une pratique discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. La LCDP ne pr\u00e9voit aucun droit distinct \u00e0 l'accommodement. L'obligation d'accommodement n'existe que dans le contexte du paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP et seulement lorsque l'intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente une justification de bonne foi \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9fense \u00e0 une all\u00e9gation de discrimination. [Graham c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes 2007 TCDP 40.]\nV. LA D\u00c9CISION [73] Pour les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je conclus que BMO a cong\u00e9di\u00e9 Mme Roopnarine en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de rendement. Sa d\u00e9ficience, soit la blessure au poignet caus\u00e9e par des microtraumatismes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s, n'\u00e9tait pas un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de la cong\u00e9dier.\n[74] En ce qui a trait aux questions de l'accommodement avant le cong\u00e9diement, je conclus que BMO a tent\u00e9 d'accommoder Mme Roopnarine et a pris des mesures d'accommodement appropri\u00e9es au sujet de sa blessure au poignet. BMO lui a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter un rapport m\u00e9dical qui pr\u00e9cisait le type d'accommodement requis. D\u00e8s que BMO a re\u00e7u ce rapport, des mesures d'accommodement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour que Mme Roopnarine ne travaille pas plus de quatre heures par jour avec une souris et un clavier. Les employ\u00e9s de BMO n'ont pas agi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers elle en cours d'emploi.\n[75] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette la plainte puisqu'elle n'est pas fond\u00e9e. J'ai examin\u00e9 la preuve, tant chacun de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments que l'ensemble qu'ils forment collectivement, et je n'y ai relev\u00e9 aucune contravention \u00e0 l'article 7 de la LCDP.\nSign\u00e9e par Shirish P.

Introduction [1] La compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux (CN) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate le 19 janvier 2010, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 3(1) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, demandant au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) de rouvrir l'audience dans les affaires Kasha A. Whyte c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux et Cindy Richards c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux, afin que CN puisse [traduction] pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires qui n'\u00e9taient pas disponibles au moment de l'audience .\nII. Les faits pertinents quant \u00e0 la requ\u00eate A. Les plaintes de Cindy Richards et de Kasha Whyte [2] Cindy Richards et Kasha Whyte ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes dans lesquelles elles all\u00e9guent que CN a contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la LCDP), pour le motif de distinction illicite fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille. Sur consentement, les deux plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9unies pour l'audience devant le Tribunal. L'audience a eu lieu du 22 au 24 septembre, du 6 au 9 octobre, le 22 octobre, du 26 au 30 octobre et les 12 et 13 novembre, 2009. Sauf le 22 octobre, auquel moment l'audience a eu lieu \u00e0 Ottawa afin d'accommoder un des t\u00e9moins de CN, l'audience s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e \u00e0 Jasper (Alberta).\n[3] Bien que la requ\u00eate ne traite pas directement de cette affaire, il est important de noter que CN \u00e9tait aussi intim\u00e9e dans une autre audience tenue \u00e0 Jasper, dans laquelle une autre plaignante, Denise Seeley, avait soulev\u00e9 des questions semblables \u00e0 celles des affaires Whyte et Richards. L'affaire Seeley a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue du 10 au 14 ao\u00fbt et les conclusions finales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues le 21 septembre 2009, le jour pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but de l'audience des affaires Whyte et Richards.\n[4] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience des affaires Whyte et Richards sera trait\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail dans la d\u00e9cision sur le fond. Cependant, pour comprendre les questions de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, le Tribunal croit qu'il est important de pr\u00e9senter un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 d'une partie de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'audience. Mme Whyte, Mme Richards et Mme Seeley \u00e9taient des chefs de train travaillant pour CN. Vers le milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 pied. En f\u00e9vrier 2005, avec 45 autres employ\u00e9s mis \u00e0 pied, elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9es afin de combler une p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver. All\u00e9guant des probl\u00e8mes avec leurs familles respectives, elles ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 Vancouver. Compte tenu du fait qu'elles ne se sont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au travail, CN les a cong\u00e9di\u00e9es. Mme Richards, Mme Whyte et Mme Seeley ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en vertu de la LCDP. CN a d\u00e9fendu sa d\u00e9cision en soutenant d'abord que la situation de ces employ\u00e9es n'\u00e9tait pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP et, subsidiairement, que si leur situation \u00e9tait vis\u00e9e par la LCDP, CN avait pris des mesures d'accommodement pour elles en leur donnant plus de temps pour se rendre \u00e0 Vancouver, afin qu'elles puissent d'abord r\u00e9gler leurs situations personnelles. CN a aussi pr\u00e9tendu que le fait d'accorder aux plaignantes le redressement qu'elles demandent lui causerait une contrainte excessive parce que cela \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 leur accorder une super anciennet\u00e9 simplement en raison de leur statut de parent.\n[5] \u00c0 l'audience Seeley, CN \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le m\u00eame avocat qui la repr\u00e9sentait dans l'affaire Whyte et Richards, et l'avocate de la Commission \u00e9tait aussi la m\u00eame. Mme Seeley \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat diff\u00e9rent de celle de Mme Whyte et de Mme Richards. Ni Mesdames Whyte et Richards ni leur avocate, n'a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 l'audience dans l'affaire Seeley, bien que le Tribunal n'ait rendu aucune ordonnance ou directive les emp\u00eachant d'y assister. Pour l'essentiel, sauf quelques distinctions mineures, la m\u00eame preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les deux audiences et, sauf pour un t\u00e9moin, CN a appel\u00e9 les m\u00eames t\u00e9moins dans les deux affaires.\nB. Les dossiers du syst\u00e8me d'attribution des \u00e9quipes et de contr\u00f4le des pr\u00e9sences (CATS) [6] Afin de comprendre le fond de la requ\u00eate, il est important de traiter, avec un certain d\u00e9tail, de l'historique de la divulgation des dossiers qui sont en question en l'esp\u00e8ce en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, lorsque c'est appropri\u00e9, \u00e0 la transcription des t\u00e9moignages et au dossier de l'audience.\n[7] La requ\u00eate de CN fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des renseignements qui se trouvent sur des feuilles de calcul Excel qui ont d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l'audience de l'affaire Seeley, puis \u00e0 l'audience des affaires Richards et Whyte. CN d\u00e9crit ces renseignements comme \u00e9tant [traduction] les donn\u00e9es originales .\n[8] Selon la preuve incontest\u00e9e pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission, ces documents ont d'abord \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s dans les renseignements communiqu\u00e9s par CN une semaine avant l'audience de l'affaire Seeley. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s au Tribunal le 3 ao\u00fbt 2009 par l'avocat de CN, et des copies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Renouf, l'avocat de Mme Seeley, et \u00e0 la Commission. Dans la lettre accompagnant les documents, l'avocat de CN a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction]\nEn raison de l'audience \u00e0 venir dans l'affaire susmentionn\u00e9e [l'affaire Seeley] et de la lettre du 28 juillet 2009 de l'avocat de la plaignante [M. Renouf], CN a l'intention de pr\u00e9senter les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires suivants au Tribunal :\nLa politique d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi du CN et les rapports d\u00e9taill\u00e9s d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d'emploi pour les ann\u00e9es 1996 \u00e0 2008. Ces rapports sont des documents publics affich\u00e9s sur le site Web de Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada;\nDes extraits du syst\u00e8me de gestion du personnel SAPS de CN qui d\u00e9taillent, pour l'ann\u00e9e 2005, le statut des employ\u00e9s portant le nom AB, HI, P, U et Y mentionn\u00e9s dans l'expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de CN . [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[9] La lettre expliquait aussi la raison motivant cette communication :\n[traduction]\nAucun de ces documents n'ajoute de faits suppl\u00e9mentaires au d\u00e9bat, et leur communication vise seulement \u00e0 faciliter la pr\u00e9sentation de faits et de t\u00e9moignages d\u00e9j\u00e0 produits au sujet, respectivement, du statut d'emploi des femmes au sein de CN et du fait \u00e9nonc\u00e9 au paragraphe 40c) de l'expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de CN. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[10] Le paragraphe 40c) de l'expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de CN dans l'affaire Seeley mentionne cinq (5) employ\u00e9s \u00e0 qui on a permis de ne pas se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver et qui sont rest\u00e9s employ\u00e9s de CN par la suite. Ce m\u00eame paragraphe est aussi reproduit dans l'expos\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de CN pour les affaires Whyte et Richards.\n[11] Le 5 ao\u00fbt 2009, l'avocate de la Commission a \u00e9crit \u00e0 l'avocat de CN pour demander que CN pr\u00e9sente les m\u00eames renseignements pour tous les autres employ\u00e9s qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver. Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 M. Renouf le 7 ao\u00fbt 2009. Les dossiers des 42 autres employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 copi\u00e9s dans une feuille de calcul Excel et contenaient de nombreuses pages de renseignements au sujet du statut de ces employ\u00e9s pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les plaintes.\n[12] Le 11 septembre 2009, l'avocate de la Commission a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 l'avocat de CN pour lui demander si les documents pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s le 7 ao\u00fbt 2009 seraient aussi communiqu\u00e9s dans les affaires Whyte et Richards. Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s en temps utile \u00e0 l'avocate de Mme Whyte et de Mme Richards.\n[13] Comme je l'ai mentionn\u00e9, l'audience des plaintes Whyte et Richards a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 22 septembre 2009, le jour suivant les conclusions finales dans l'affaire Seeley. L'audience a continu\u00e9 pendant presque 15 jours, \u00e0 diverses dates au cours de l'automne. Selon la liste des pi\u00e8ces de l'intim\u00e9e , CN a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les dossiers CATS de cinq employ\u00e9s (voir la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglets 27 \u00e0 31, inclusivement) et deux autres dossiers CATS (voir les pi\u00e8ces R-10 et R-11). Ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s en preuve par Mme Elaine Storms, directrice principale du Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes du Centre d'exploitation de l'Ouest de CN \u00e0 Edmonton, un t\u00e9moin important de CN.\n[14] Quant \u00e0 elle, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve les dossiers CATS de quinze (15) autres employ\u00e9s (voir pi\u00e8ces HR-1, onglets 5 \u00e0 10 inclusivement, et HR-2, onglets 23 \u00e0 30 inclusivement). Ces documents ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s en preuve par Mme Storms.\n[15] Le reste des dossiers CATS a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en preuve par l'avocate des plaignantes (voir pi\u00e8ce C-33), mais pas dans le format dans lequel CN les avait communiqu\u00e9s. Pendant le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Storms le 26 octobre 2009, Mme Chahley, l'avocate des plaignantes, a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle avait cr\u00e9\u00e9 un nouveau format en r\u00e9organisant les renseignements qui se trouvaient dans la feuille de calcul Excel que CN avait originalement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Ce nouveau document \u00e9tait organis\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 montrer quels employ\u00e9s rappel\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver \u00e9taient disponibles \u00e0 une date donn\u00e9e en 2005.\n[16] M. Paquette, l'avocat de CN, a soulev\u00e9 une objection au sujet de la production de ce document dans le format cr\u00e9\u00e9 par Mme Chahley. Le passage pertinent de la transcription \u00e0 ce sujet est le suivant :\n[traduction]\nM. PAQUETTE : Je dois soulever une objection quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont ce document est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au t\u00e9moin. Comme Mme Chahley l'a mentionn\u00e9, beaucoup de renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effac\u00e9s du document et je m'inqui\u00e8te de la possibilit\u00e9 qu'il soit pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 essentiellement, pardonnez le terme, comme un choix des entr\u00e9es o\u00f9 il est seulement inscrit disponible . Le t\u00e9moin n'a pas de contexte \u00e0 partir duquel il est possible de formuler une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te.\n[17] Le Tribunal a tranch\u00e9 cette objection comme suit :\n[traduction]\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : [...] Je laisserai Mme Chahley proc\u00e9der avec ce document. [...] Si vous avez de la difficult\u00e9 avec les renseignements qui y sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, vous pourrez certainement inclure dans votre r\u00e9plique tout renseignement additionnel qui vous semble n\u00e9cessaire pour compl\u00e9ter le document, et je vous permettrai de le faire \u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0. Ou, si le t\u00e9moin en arrive \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 elle dit je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9e, je n'arrive pas \u00e0 suivre les renseignements de la fa\u00e7on dont ils sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s , nous reviendrons au document complet. [...] Le t\u00e9moin peut certainement se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer au document complet si elle souhaite le faire. Ou, si elle croit qu'elle n'est pas capable de r\u00e9pondre aux questions, elle [le] dira certainement. Ou si vous souhaitez compl\u00e9ter le document, si vous croyez qu'il est incomplet et que les renseignements ne s'y trouvent pas tous, vous pourrez le faire dans votre r\u00e9plique.\n[18] L'avocat de CN n'a soulev\u00e9 aucune autre objection pendant le contre-interrogatoire de son t\u00e9moin au sujet du document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par Mme Chahley. Pendant le r\u00e9interrogatoire de son t\u00e9moin, M. Paquette ne lui a pas pos\u00e9 de questions au sujet de ce document et il n'a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ou mentionn\u00e9 d'autres renseignements qui auraient pu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s pour compl\u00e9ter ou expliquer le document.\n[19] Le contre-interrogatoire de Mme Storms montre qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail par les avocates des plaignantes et de la Commission au sujet des dossiers du CATS. Compte tenu des questions soulev\u00e9es par CN dans sa requ\u00eate, il convient de reproduire les extraits suivants de la transcription de son t\u00e9moignage :\n[traduction]\nMME CHAHLEY : D'accord. Donc, pour ces feuilles du CATS, je crois que vous avez dit hier que lorsqu'il est inscrit disponible pour un employ\u00e9, \u00e7a signifie qu'il est inscrit au tableau, mais qu'il ne travaille pas ce jour l\u00e0, est-ce correct?\nMME STORMS : \u00c7a signifie qu'il est inscrit au tableau, mais qu'il ne travaille pas ce jour l\u00e0, oui.\nMME CHAHLEY : Et qu'il serait disponible pour un rappel de deux heures, c'est \u00e7a?\nMME STORMS : En fait, dans ce document, il pourrait \u00eatre en p\u00e9riode de repos ou - ce document ne contient pas certains des d\u00e9tails qui seraient inscrits dans un registre de travail. Donc, je devrais comparer avec un registre de travail pour v\u00e9rifier, mais en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, disponible signifie que l'employ\u00e9 est disponible pour un rappel.\n[...]\nMME CHAHLEY : Donc, nous savons qu'un employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler au moins un de ces deux jours, et possiblement les deux jours, c'est bien \u00e7a?\nMME STORMS : Une fois de plus, c'est tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 dire sans le dossier de travail complet.\nMME CHAHLEY : Eh bien, Mme Storm, CN ne m'a pas donn\u00e9 le dossier de travail complet. C'est tout --\nMME STORMS : Je comprends \u00e7a.\nMME CHAHLEY : -- ce que j'ai [...] Et j'ai cru que CN me donnait le document qui me donnait l'information. Donc, travaillons avec ce que nous avons ici. Me dites-vous que c'est impossible de faire une d\u00e9claration sans avoir le dossier de travail complet?\nMME STORMS : Bien, parce que ce type de document est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une capture d'\u00e9cran \u00e0 une heure pr\u00e9cise, je dis que \u00e7a serait difficile de vous le dire, oui.\nMME CHAHLEY : Donc, nous ne pouvons pas supposer qu'un de ces employ\u00e9s \u00e9tait disponible l'un de ces jours?\nMME STORMS : Non - c'est difficile \u00e0 dire. Disons que la capture d'\u00e9cran a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 quatre heures du matin et que l'employ\u00e9 para\u00eet disponible, mais qu'il travaillait \u00e0 huit heures, je ne le verrais pas dans ce document.\nMME CHAHLEY : Il ne serait pas indiqu\u00e9 qu'il travaille, si l'employ\u00e9 a travaill\u00e9 pendant la journ\u00e9e?\nMME STORMS : Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9e oui, vous avez raison.\n[...]\nMME CHAHLEY : Maintenant, corrigez-moi si j'ai tort, mais ce que je vois, c'est qu'un employ\u00e9, lorsqu'il travaille, a la cote B au lieu de A.\nMME STORMS : Oui, c'est exact.\nMME CHAHLEY : Et il est \u00e9crit travaille ?\nMME STORMS : C'est \u00e7a. S'il a travaill\u00e9 pendant cette p\u00e9riode, c'est exact.\nMME CHAHLEY : Et, parce que c'est par jour, je suppose, et corrigez moi si j'ai tort, que \u00e7a signifie \u00e0 un certain moment au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 24 heures pendant laquelle il a travaill\u00e9?\nMME STORMS : Oui.\n[...]\nMME CHAHLEY : [...] Si la personne travaille au cours de la p\u00e9riode de 24 heures, le syst\u00e8me, comme il semble configur\u00e9, montrerait qu'elle travaille -\nMME STORMS : C'est exact.\nMME CHAHLEY : Donc, si le syst\u00e8me montre que l'employ\u00e9 est disponible -\nMME STORMS : Il est soit en repos, soit disponible. Je ne peux pas voir quel autre statut il aurait.\n[...]\nMME CHAHLEY : Ma question \u00e9tait : pouvez-vous expliquer ce qui se passe? J'ai sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que, m\u00eame avec la meilleure intention, il y a eu des moments o\u00f9 des employ\u00e9s n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s efficace, et que des gestionnaires ont travaill\u00e9 m\u00eame si des conducteurs \u00e9taient disponibles, et vous avez dit : \u00c7a ne peut pas arriver . Je vous explique que c'est bien arriv\u00e9.\nMME STORMS : Et je ne dis pas que \u00e7a ne pourrait pas arriver, je dis juste que ce serait tr\u00e8s inhabituel, que \u00e7a a pu se produire, mais que \u00e7a serait inhabituel. C'est tout ce que je dis.\nMME CHAHLEY : Pouvez-vous expliquer pourquoi l'employ\u00e9 Monsieur M. \u00e9tait encore disponible et qu'il ne travaillait pas?\nMME STORMS : Non, je ne peux pas.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n(Extraits du t\u00e9moignage d'Elaine Storms, 26 octobre 2009).\n[20] Le matin du 12 novembre 2009, le jour o\u00f9 les parties devaient commencer \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter leurs conclusions finales, deux questions pr\u00e9judicielles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es. La premi\u00e8re, soulev\u00e9e par Me Paquette, \u00e9tait une demande d'ajournement afin que les parties puissent discuter de la possibilit\u00e9 d'un r\u00e8glement. Le Tribunal a refus\u00e9 cette demande, indiquant que l'audience avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pass\u00e9 de beaucoup le temps qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vu. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les parties pouvaient, si elles le d\u00e9siraient, opter pour le m\u00e9canisme du r\u00e8glement, mais que le Tribunal ne croyait pas qu'il \u00e9tait dans leur int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur d'accorder un ajournement \u00e0 une date aussi tardive.\n[21] La deuxi\u00e8me question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e par Me Chahley :\n[traduction]\nMME CHAHLEY : Monsieur, je me trouve en mauvaise posture. Je dois discuter d'une question avec vous. Mon ami l'a indiqu\u00e9, Me Paquette a une autre question qu'il a soulev\u00e9e il y a quelques minutes au sujet de probl\u00e8mes possibles quant \u00e0 l'exactitude de certains documents de CN. Je ne peux pas, comme officier de justice, continuer sans que la question soit au moins mentionn\u00e9e au d\u00e9but de l'audience aujourd'hui. Je crois qu'il est important que le Tribunal soit au courant d'o\u00f9 nous nous trouvons en ce qui a trait au d\u00e9roulement, m\u00eame s'il est n\u00e9cessaire de contre-interroger plus longuement le m\u00eame t\u00e9moin, et il n'est pas appropri\u00e9 de laisser la question en suspens \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape.\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Quelle est cette question?\nM. PAQUETTE : Monsieur, il s'agit des dossiers du CATS qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s \u00e0 l'audience. Tard hier soir, ou t\u00f4t ce matin, selon votre interpr\u00e9tation, j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 que les dossiers du CATS pourraient \u00eatre inexacts en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de disponible par rapport \u00e0 travaille .\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Eh bien, je dois certainement entendre - CN est une entreprise de haute technicit\u00e9 et c'est maintenant rendu \u00e0 un point o\u00f9 je suis dans une position o\u00f9 je n'arrive pas vraiment \u00e0 comprendre ce qui se passe. Des documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits en preuve par la personne responsable du syst\u00e8me CATS, des membres du CN ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9s pendant une semaine et demie au sujet de ces documents et vous me dites maintenant que vous n'avez appris qu'hier soir que ces documents pourraient \u00eatre inexacts?\nM. PAQUETTE : Oui Monsieur.\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Est-ce qu'ils - les nouveaux renseignements qui viennent de para\u00eetre -\nMME CHAHLEY : Nous ne savons pas encore ce que c'est, Monsieur, mais je voudrais aussi noter que ces documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s dans l'affaire Seeley aussi.\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Oui, je sais.\nMME CHAHLEY : Je veux dire, nous sommes abasourdis et ...\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Moi aussi.\nMME CHAHLEY : Mais je ne pouvais pas garder cela sous silence. Nous ne pouvons pas terminer aujourd'hui, puis avoir de nouveaux - il faut r\u00e9gler la question.\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Bien, c'est not\u00e9 et les plaignantes composeront avec les documents tels qu'ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, et les renseignements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s seront les renseignements existants. Je ne peux pas accepter, aussi tard, que l'avocat me dise qu'il n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que tard hier soir. Je ne doute pas que c'est le cas, mais vous aviez des t\u00e9moins qui connaissaient tr\u00e8s bien le fonctionnement du syst\u00e8me CATS.\nM. PAQUETTE : Ce n'est pas une question du syst\u00e8me CATS comme tel, mais plut\u00f4t de la fa\u00e7on dont les rapports ont \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s.\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Eh bien, c'est quelque chose qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 quand la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e. Malheureusement, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9s en preuve environ trois semaines apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l'audience, avec les renseignements qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9s, et nous devons accepter \u00e7a. Je le mentionnerai certainement dans ma d\u00e9cision \u00e0 un certain point.\nM. PAQUETTE : Je comprends et -\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : Et, encore, encore ces renseignements devront aussi \u00eatre communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 M. Renouf dans l'affaire Seeley.\nM. PAQUETTE : Si je peux me permettre, Monsieur, en ce moment, il n'y a pas vraiment de renseignement comme tel. Ce que j'ai compris de la question -\nMEMBRE INSTRUCTEUR : L'information que vous venez de me donner, qu'il pourrait y avoir - je veux que ce soit fait parce que je traiterai la question dans la d\u00e9cision de l'affaire Seeley aussi, cette information doit \u00eatre envoy\u00e9e - vous avez avis\u00e9 les deux avocates ce matin, la Commission et Mme Chahley. J'ordonne que vous envoyiez une lettre \u00e0 M. Renouf pour lui donner les m\u00eames renseignements, avec copie conforme au Tribunal.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[22] Comme la transcription le d\u00e9montre clairement, Me Paquette n'a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune requ\u00eate ce matin-l\u00e0 au sujet des nouveaux renseignements et n'a jamais pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d'explication au sujet de ces renseignements et de la personne qui les avait fournis. De plus, la transcription de l'\u00e9change de ce matin-l\u00e0 contredit clairement et simplement le souvenir de Me Paquette tel qu'il para\u00eet au paragraphe 9 de la requ\u00eate de CN. Dans ce paragraphe, apr\u00e8s avoir expliqu\u00e9 qu'il avait port\u00e9 cette information \u00e0 l'attention des avocates des plaignantes et de la Commission, Me Paquette d\u00e9clare : [traduction] L'avocat de CN a aussi expliqu\u00e9 la divergence \u00e0 Michel Doucet, le membre du Tribunal saisi de l'affaire. L'avocat de CN a expliqu\u00e9 que, selon les indications fournies par Mme Rusnak la nuit pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, les donn\u00e9es originales pouvaient \u00eatre trompeuses en ce qui a trait aux circonstances pour lesquelles des employ\u00e9s seraient class\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant disponibles pour le travail. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[23] Les extraits de la transcription reproduits ci-dessus montrent clairement que le souvenir de Me Paquette n'est pas enti\u00e8rement exact. Il n'a jamais donn\u00e9 d' explication au Tribunal au sujet de ce qu'il d\u00e9crit comme une divergence dans la preuve. Au plus, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] [t]ard hier soir, ou t\u00f4t ce matin il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] avis\u00e9 que les dossiers du CATS pourraient \u00eatre inexacts en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de disponible par rapport \u00e0 travaille , sans donner d'autre explication ou d\u00e9tail. Il a m\u00eame ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] en ce moment, il n'y a pas vraiment de renseignement comme tel . Il n'a certainement jamais mentionn\u00e9 que ces renseignements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis par Mme Rusnak, nom que le Tribunal n'a vu pour la premi\u00e8re fois que dans l'affidavit de Mme Storm, ni m\u00eame que ces renseignements lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Mme Storms.\n[24] Dans son affidavit, Mme Storms a donn\u00e9 une explication plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de ce qui s'est produit le soir du 11 novembre 2009. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 qu'elle n'a pas cr\u00e9\u00e9 les feuilles de calcul Excel au sujet desquelles elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9e et contre-interrog\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail. Elle a soutenu aussi qu'elle a vu ces documents pour la premi\u00e8re fois alors qu'elle se pr\u00e9parait pour son t\u00e9moignage dans l'affaire Seeley. Selon son affidavit, les feuilles de calcul Excel ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9es \u00e0 partir du programme CATS de CN par un employ\u00e9 du Resources Management Group de CN (groupe de gestion des ressources), mais le nom de l'employ\u00e9 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9cis\u00e9. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] Cependant, parce que je n'ai pas pr\u00e9par\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es originales et que j'ai vu des rapports semblables par le pass\u00e9, j'ai suppos\u00e9 au moment de mon t\u00e9moignage, tant \u00e0 l'audience Seeley qu'\u00e0 l'audience des affaires Whyte et Richards, que [la feuille de calcul Excel] \u00e9tait un document complet portant sur les registres de travail complets des 47 employ\u00e9s. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[25] Au paragraphe 7 de son affidavit, elle a ajout\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nLe soir du 11 novembre 2009, pendant l'audience des affaires Richards et Whyte, j'ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Michelle Rusnak, une superviseure d'\u00e9quipe au Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes, d'examiner les registres de travail de chacun des 47 employ\u00e9s. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, je voulais v\u00e9rifier o\u00f9 se trouvaient les 47 employ\u00e9s les jours o\u00f9 les donn\u00e9es originales indiquaient qu'ils n'\u00e9taient pas disponibles (en raison de cong\u00e9s, de vacances, de maladie, de cong\u00e9s autoris\u00e9s, etc.) afin d'aider M. Paquette \u00e0 possiblement expliquer pourquoi ces employ\u00e9s avaient travaill\u00e9 moins souvent que pr\u00e9vu. En menant cet examen, Mme Rusnak m'a avis\u00e9e que les donn\u00e9es originales semblaient incompl\u00e8tes.\n[26] Mme Storms a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'elle avait imm\u00e9diatement avis\u00e9 Me Paquette de cette divergence aux petites heures du matin le 12 novembre 2009. Elle a ensuite \u00e9crit que le matin du 12 novembre 2009, Me Paquette a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette information \u00e0 Me Chahley et Me Osborne-Brown, l'avocate de la Commission. Elle a aussi ajout\u00e9 que [traduction] M. Paquette a aussi avis\u00e9 M. Michel Doucet, le membre du Tribunal saisi de l'affaire, de cette divergence. Malheureusement, la transcription de l'audience n'appuie pas cette pr\u00e9tention. Ce n'est pas Me Paquette qui a soulev\u00e9 la question devant le Tribunal, mais bien Me Chahley, et lorsque Me Paquette a abord\u00e9 le sujet, il n'a pas expliqu\u00e9 ce que cette divergence \u00e9tait, mais a seulement mentionn\u00e9 que les renseignements des feuilles de calcul Excel \u00e9taient incomplets, sans donner de d\u00e9tails. Il a m\u00eame ajout\u00e9 [traduction] en ce moment, il n'y a pas vraiment de renseignement comme tel.\n[27] Enfin, Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s la conclusion de l'audience Richards et Whyte, elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l'exactitude des registres de travail des 47 employ\u00e9s soit examin\u00e9e par le groupe de gestion des ressources de CN. Selon son affidavit, les registres de travail complets des 47 employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 extraits [traduction] de divers syst\u00e8mes informatis\u00e9s et [traduction] un nouveau document Excel a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 qui constituait [traduction] le dossier le plus exact pour l'ann\u00e9e 2005, dans lequel on retrouve le terminal dans lequel chacun des 47 employ\u00e9s a travaill\u00e9 et combien de quarts de travail chacun des 47 employ\u00e9s a assur\u00e9.\nIII. La question en litige [28] La seule question en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est celle de savoir si le Tribunal devrait accorder la requ\u00eate de CN et lui permettre de rouvrir l'affaire pour pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui, comme le soutient CN, n'\u00e9taient pas disponibles \u00e0 l'audience.\n[29] La Commission a soulev\u00e9 une autre question. Elle soutient que le Tribunal est dessaisi parce qu'il a [traduction] d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9 la question au sujet du fait que les documents du CATS \u00e9taient pr\u00e9tendument incomplets. Un examen attentif de la transcription du 12 novembre 2009 montre clairement que ce n'est pas une description correcte de ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 ce matin-l\u00e0. Le 12 novembre, aucune requ\u00eate n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal pour qu'il tranche [traduction] la question du caract\u00e8re incomplet des documents du CATS . Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune ordonnance ne peut avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 ce sujet. La seule ordonnance rendue ce matin-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait celle enjoignant \u00e0 Me Paquette d'aviser Me Renouf, l'avocat de Mme Seeley, des nouveaux d\u00e9veloppements concernant les documents du CATS.\nIV. LE DROIT [30] La seule jurisprudence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les parties pour la question en litige est la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l'affaire Vermette c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada [1994] D.C.D.P. n\u00b0 14 (conf. [1996] A.C.F. no 1274). Dans cette d\u00e9cision, le Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans Gass c. Childs (1958), 43 M.P.R. 87, pour justifier la r\u00e9ception d'un nouvel \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve :\nDans l'affaire Gass v. Childs, (1958) 43 M.P.R. 87, \u00e0 la p. 93, le juge Ritchie \u00e9nonce trois crit\u00e8res dont un tribunal doit v\u00e9rifier l'existence avant d'exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rouvrir une preuve :\n[traduction]\nLes trois conditions \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es ci-dessous doivent \u00eatre r\u00e9unies pour qu'un tribunal soit justifi\u00e9 d'accepter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou d'ordonner un nouveau proc\u00e8s :\n1. il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli que m\u00eame en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable il n'aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d'obtenir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour pr\u00e9sentation au proc\u00e8s;\n2. les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doivent \u00eatre susceptibles d'influer substantiellement sur l'issue de l'affaire, quoiqu'ils n'aient pas \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9terminants;\n3. les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve doivent \u00eatre vraisemblables ou, autrement dit, ils doivent para\u00eetre cr\u00e9dibles m\u00eame s'il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu'ils soient irr\u00e9cusables.\n[31] Dans Vermette, le Tribunal a aussi mentionn\u00e9 d'autres d\u00e9cisions qui portaient sur une demande de r\u00e9ouverture de dossier :\nDans leur ouvrage The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases, MM. Sopinka et Lederman d\u00e9crivent ainsi les principes applicables \u00e0 l'exercice de ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans les cas o\u00f9 la demande de r\u00e9ouverture est soumise apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision :\n[traduction] Hors les cas de fraude ou de surprise, il doit s'agir d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve r\u00e9cemment obtenus qui n'auraient pas pu \u00eatre d\u00e9couverts pendant l'instruction, m\u00eame en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable, et dont la nature fait qu'ils auraient pu constituer un facteur d\u00e9terminant dans la d\u00e9cision (\u00e0 la p. 542).\nDans les cas o\u00f9 la demande de r\u00e9ouverture est soumise avant que la d\u00e9cision soit rendue, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu que les tribunaux disposent de plus de latitude. Dans l'ouvrage pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, MM. Sopinka et Lederman indiquent que la r\u00e9ouverture peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e [TRADUCTION] lorsque l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice le requiert (\u00e0 la p. 541). \u00c0 l'appui de cette affirmation, ils citent notamment l'affaire Sunny Isle Farms v. Mayhew (1972), 27 D.L.R. (3d) 323 (C.S.\u00ce.-.P.-\u00c9.), dans laquelle le juge Nicholson a fait siens les propos suivants tenus par le juge Boyle dans l'affaire Sales v. Calgary Stock Exchange, [1931] 3 W.W.R. 392, \u00e0 la p. 394 (C.A.Alb.) :\n[traduction] Rouvrir un proc\u00e8s une fois que toute la preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue est, selon moi, un geste tr\u00e8s grave. Cela ne devrait jamais \u00eatre fait \u00e0 moins qu'il ne semble imp\u00e9ratif, dans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice, de rouvrir la preuve pour y ajouter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments.\n[32] Dans sa requ\u00eate, CN soutient que l'ordonnance qu'elle demande devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e parce que la situation soulev\u00e9e satisfait aux volets du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans la d\u00e9cision Vermette. Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal conclut que CN n'a pas satisfait \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re et que la requ\u00eate de CN est donc rejet\u00e9e. Le Tribunal traitera chacun des volets du crit\u00e8re, bien que le d\u00e9faut de satisfaire \u00e0 un seul des volets soit suffisant pour rejeter la requ\u00eate.\n(i) Aurait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 possible, en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable, d'obtenir la preuve pour pr\u00e9sentation \u00e0 l'audience, avant ou pendant l'audience? [33] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ce volet est oui . La requ\u00eate de CN et l'affidavit de Mme Storms \u00e0 l'appui de la requ\u00eate, ainsi que la transcription de l'audience, montrent clairement que les renseignements que CN souhaite maintenant pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal pouvaient \u00eatre obtenus avant et pendant les deux audiences.\n[34] Examinons d'abord l'affidavit de Mme Storms : il est clair que si CN avait fait preuve de diligence raisonnable pendant l'audience Seeley, ou imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s cette audience, et m\u00eame apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Storms \u00e0 l'audience des affaires Whyte et Richards, elle aurait facilement pu obtenir les renseignements. \u00c0 ce sujet, Mme Storms a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 7 de son affidavit :\n[traduction]\nPendant mon t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience des affaires Whyte et Richards, l'avocate des plaignantes a not\u00e9 que les donn\u00e9es originales semblaient indiquer que plusieurs des 47 employ\u00e9s n'avaient pas r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9 pendant plusieurs jours de suite en 2005, alors qu'ils paraissaient comme disponibles (pour CN, cela signifie qu'un employ\u00e9 peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9, mais qu'il n'est pas pr\u00e9sentement au travail). Cela m'a surpris parce que j'\u00e9tais \u00e0 Vancouver g\u00e9rant la p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin 2005 et qu'il s'agissait d'un terminal tr\u00e8s occup\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque. De plus, CN avait demand\u00e9 aux employ\u00e9s de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 Vancouver en raison d'une des p\u00e9nuries d'employ\u00e9s les plus importantes que CN ait v\u00e9cue. \u00c0 mon avis, les employ\u00e9s auraient d\u00fb avoir plus de quarts de travail inscrits dans les donn\u00e9es originales. Cependant, j'ai souvent travaill\u00e9 avec des documents semblables \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit et j'ai cru que le rapport \u00e9tait complet.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[35] Ce paragraphe laisse perplexe pour de nombreuses raisons. D'abord, le fait que Mme Storms se soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9e [traduction] surprise que les [traduction] donn\u00e9es originales semblent indiquer que plusieurs des employ\u00e9s n'avaient pas r\u00e9ellement travaill\u00e9 pendant la p\u00e9nurie \u00e0 Vancouver ne para\u00eet pas dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience. Par exemple, pendant le contre-interrogatoire men\u00e9 par Me Chahley le 26 octobre 2009, on lui a demand\u00e9 directement si elle pouvait expliquer pourquoi des employ\u00e9s seraient disponibles \u00e0 Vancouver, sans travailler. Sa r\u00e9ponse a \u00e9t\u00e9 : [traduction] je ne dis pas que \u00e7a ne pourrait pas arriver, je dis juste que ce serait tr\u00e8s inhabituel, que \u00e7a a pu se produire, mais que \u00e7a serait inhabituel. C'est tout ce que je dis. Puis, lorsque Me Chahley lui a demand\u00e9 : [traduction] Pouvez-vous expliquer pourquoi l'employ\u00e9 Monsieur M. \u00e9tait encore disponible et qu'il ne travaillait pas? , elle a r\u00e9pondu [traduction] Non, je ne peux pas. Rien n'indique qu'\u00e0 ce moment l\u00e0, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] surprise par cette information et qu'elle tenterait de trouver une explication. Rien ne montrait non plus qu'elle doutait de la validit\u00e9 de l'information. Au contraire, elle n'a pas rejet\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 que l'information \u00e9tait exacte, elle a seulement ajout\u00e9 que c'\u00e9tait [traduction] inhabituel , mais que [traduction] \u00e7a a pu se produire .\n[36] L'autre probl\u00e8me que je rel\u00e8ve au paragraphe 7 de l'affidavit de Mme Storms est la derni\u00e8re phrase, qui se lit comme suit : [traduction] Cependant, j'ai souvent travaill\u00e9 avec des documents semblables \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit et j'ai cru que le rapport \u00e9tait complet. Si je comprends bien cette phrase, Mme Storms nous dit qu'elle a suppos\u00e9 que le rapport \u00e9tait complet et exact parce qu'elle avait [traduction] souvent travaill\u00e9 avec des documents semblables . Son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience et la fa\u00e7on dont elle a r\u00e9pondu aux questions qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es en interrogatoire et en contre-interrogatoire corroborent cette conclusion. Lorsqu'elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9, elle n'avait aucun doute au sujet de l'exactitude des documents. Si Mme Storms avait dout\u00e9 de l'exactitude, elle aurait certainement fait les v\u00e9rifications n\u00e9cessaires et soulev\u00e9 la question imm\u00e9diatement aupr\u00e8s de l'avocat de CN, elle n'aurait pas attendu jusqu'au 11 novembre, soit quatorze jours apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l'audience Whyte et Richards et plus d'un mois et demi apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage dans l'affaire Seeley, pour soulever ses inqui\u00e9tudes. Elle n'explique pas dans son affidavit pourquoi elle n'a pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 et n'a pas pos\u00e9 de questions avant le soir du 11 novembre 2009, ni pourquoi elle a senti le besoin de le faire le 11 novembre.\n[37] Il ressort aussi de son affidavit que l'examen des [traduction] registres de travail ne n\u00e9cessitait pas beaucoup d'heures de travail. Au paragraphe 8, elle d\u00e9clare que [traduction] le soir du 11 novembre 2009 , elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Michelle Rusnak, une superviseure d'\u00e9quipe, d'examiner les [traduction] registres de travail des 47 employ\u00e9s. Mme Rusnak a rapidement relev\u00e9 les [traduction] divergences , parce que le m\u00eame soir, elle a avis\u00e9 Mme Storms que [traduction] les donn\u00e9es originales pour plusieurs des 47 employ\u00e9s \u00e9taient incompl\u00e8tes . Plus tard ce soir l\u00e0, ou t\u00f4t le lendemain matin, Mme Storms a avis\u00e9 Me Paquette.\n[38] Quant \u00e0 savoir si CN \u00e9tait au courant qu'il y avait plus de renseignements dans le CATS que ce qu'elle avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de produire en preuve, une fois de plus les r\u00e9ponses de Mme Storms lors de son contre-interrogatoire sont r\u00e9v\u00e9latrices. Dans une partie de son contre-interrogatoire, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 reproduite ci-dessus, elle soul\u00e8ve elle-m\u00eame la possibilit\u00e9 que les renseignements complets ne se trouvaient pas tous dans la feuille de calcul Excel originale. Ci-dessous se trouvent ces extraits de la transcription :\n[traduction]\nMME CHAHLEY : Donc, nous savons qu'un employ\u00e9 \u00e9tait disponible pour travailler au moins un de ces deux jours, et possiblement les deux jours, c'est bien \u00e7a?\nMME STORMS : Une fois de plus, c'est tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 dire sans le dossier de travail complet.\nMME CHAHLEY : Eh bien, Mme Storm, CN ne m'a pas donn\u00e9 le dossier de travail complet. C'est tout --\nMME STORMS : Je comprends \u00e7a.\nMME CHAHLEY : -- ce que j'ai [...] Et j'ai cru que CN me donnait le document qui me donnait l'information.\n[39] De plus, Mme Storms mentionne aussi dans son contre-interrogatoire que ces renseignements \u00e9taient une [traduction] capture d'\u00e9cran de donn\u00e9es compil\u00e9es par le logiciel vers environ quatre heures du matin. Une fois de plus, il est important de reproduire l'\u00e9change entre Mme Storms et Mme Chahley \u00e0 ce sujet :\n[traduction]\nMME STORMS : Bien, parce que ce type de document est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement une capture d'\u00e9cran \u00e0 une heure pr\u00e9cise, je dis que \u00e7a serait difficile de vous le dire, oui.\nMME CHAHLEY : Donc, nous ne pouvons pas supposer qu'un de ces employ\u00e9s \u00e9tait disponible l'un de ces jours?\nMME STORMS : Non - c'est difficile \u00e0 dire. Disons que la capture d'\u00e9cran a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 quatre heures du matin et que l'employ\u00e9 para\u00eet disponible, mais qu'il travaillait \u00e0 huit heures, je ne le verrais pas dans ce document.\nMME CHAHLEY : Il ne serait pas indiqu\u00e9 qu'il travaille, si l'employ\u00e9 a travaill\u00e9 pendant la journ\u00e9e?\nMME STORMS : Je suis d\u00e9sol\u00e9e oui, vous avez raison.\n[40] Cet \u00e9change contredit clairement la d\u00e9claration de CN au paragraphe 6 de sa requ\u00eate, o\u00f9 elle soutient : [traduction] Cependant, sans que CN ne le sache au moment de l'audience, les donn\u00e9es originales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compil\u00e9es par le logiciel, qui effectue une capture d'\u00e9cran de la journ\u00e9e de travail d'un employ\u00e9 vers environ quatre heures du matin. [Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.] Si CN ne le savait pas, son t\u00e9moin principal \u00e0 ce sujet le savait certainement.\n[41] Mme Storms a beaucoup d'exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de directrice du Centre de gestion des \u00e9quipes et elle a d\u00e9montr\u00e9, tout au long de son t\u00e9moignage, ses connaissances du fonctionnement de CN en ce qui a trait au recrutement d'\u00e9quipes. Elle avait une tr\u00e8s bonne compr\u00e9hension du CATS et des dossiers que le syst\u00e8me pouvait g\u00e9n\u00e9rer. CN n'a pas choisi Mme Storms comme t\u00e9moin au hasard, mais l'a plut\u00f4t choisie en raison de sa bonne connaissance de la gestion des \u00e9quipes.\n[42] Si CN y avait mis des efforts, elle aurait pu obtenir cette preuve \u00e0 temps pour l'audience. L'affidavit de Mme Storms donne clairement \u00e0 penser que CN avait les renseignements en sa possession. Cette conclusion est confirm\u00e9e par le fait que Mme Rusnak, qui, selon l'affidavit de Mme Storm, a effectu\u00e9 un examen des registres de travail des employ\u00e9s le soir du 11 novembre 2009, n'a pas sembl\u00e9 avoir de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 recueillir les renseignements. Le Tribunal est d'avis que le fait d'attendre \u00e0 la veille des conclusions finales pour essayer de trouver une explication n'est pas une preuve de la diligence raisonnable n\u00e9cessaire pour satisfaire au premier volet du crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans Vermette. Le Tribunal conclut donc que CN n'a pas satisfait au premier volet du crit\u00e8re.\n[43] Cette conclusion serait suffisante pour trancher la requ\u00eate, mais comme les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments exhaustifs au sujet des deux autres volets du crit\u00e8re, le Tribunal les traitera.\n(ii) L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve influerait-il substantiellement sur l'issue de l'affaire, sans qu'il n'ait \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9terminant? [44] Dans sa requ\u00eate, CN d\u00e9clare que sans la [traduction] nouvelle preuve [...] le Tribunal pourrait conclure que le rappel au travail n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire et que, par cons\u00e9quent, le cong\u00e9diement des plaignantes n'aurait jamais d\u00fb survenir ou qu'il n'\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9 au refus de se pr\u00e9senter au travail pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s. Cette all\u00e9gation est, au mieux, hasardeuse. Il serait tr\u00e8s surprenant que le Tribunal conclue que le rappel au travail pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la p\u00e9nurie d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 Vancouver n'\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire.\n[45] L'autre raison pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par CN pour expliquer pourquoi [traduction] la nature des donn\u00e9es mises \u00e0 jour pourrait avoir [traduction] un effet d\u00e9terminant est que [traduction] le Tribunal pourrait tirer des conclusions erron\u00e9es au sujet de la capacit\u00e9 de CN en 2005 d'accommoder les plaignantes jusqu'\u00e0 contrainte excessive. La requ\u00eate de CN ne fournit aucune raison qui explique comment ces [traduction] donn\u00e9es mises \u00e0 jour pourraient affecter son argument au sujet de la contrainte excessive.\n[46] CN n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 dans sa requ\u00eate de quelle fa\u00e7on le contenu de la nouvelle feuille de calcul influerait substantiellement sur l'issue de l'affaire.\n(iii) La preuve para\u00eet-elle cr\u00e9dible? [47] CN demande une ordonnance lui permettant de rouvrir l'affaire afin de pr\u00e9senter des preuves pr\u00e9tendument plus exactes au sujet d'un document qu'elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9, qui faisait partie de ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et qui porte sur des renseignements au sujet desquels elle avait le contr\u00f4le total.\n[48] CN avait le fardeau d'\u00e9tablir les faits n\u00e9cessaires afin d'aider le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la preuve para\u00eet cr\u00e9dible. Dans son affidavit, Mme Storms a expliqu\u00e9 sommairement comment les nouveaux renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 recueillis. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s l'audience des affaires Richards et Whyte, elle a demand\u00e9 que les registres de travail des 47 employ\u00e9s soient examin\u00e9s par le groupe de gestion des ressources de CN pour en d\u00e9terminer l'exactitude. Elle n'a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 ce qu'est le groupe de gestion des ressources ni qui dans ce groupe, \u00e0 part Mme Rusnak, \u00e9tait charg\u00e9 d'effectuer l'examen. En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la m\u00e9thodologie suivie pour ce travail, elle explique seulement dans son affidavit que les [traduction] registres de travail complets ont \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] extraits de divers syst\u00e8mes informatis\u00e9s , sans donner plus de d\u00e9tails.\n[49] Ces renseignements tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9s ne donnent pas au Tribunal le contexte factuel n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9tablir si la nouvelle preuve para\u00eet cr\u00e9dible . CN a reproduit cette nouvelle preuve dans l'affidavit de Mme Storms, mais \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, le Tribunal n'a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les renseignements sont cr\u00e9dibles, compte tenu du fait que le Tribunal n'a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 d'entendre le t\u00e9moignage des personnes qui ont pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le document et que ces personnes n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9es. \u00c0 cette \u00e9tape pr\u00e9liminaire, CN a le devoir de pr\u00e9senter une preuve suffisante pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les renseignements paraissent cr\u00e9dibles, ce qu'elle n'a pas fait.\n[50] M\u00eame si le Tribunal donnait le b\u00e9n\u00e9fice du doute \u00e0 CN pour ce volet, il n'ordonnerait tout de m\u00eame pas la r\u00e9ouverture de l'affaire, parce que CN n'a pas satisfait aux deux autres volets du crit\u00e8re Vermette.\nV. Conclusion [51] Dans ses arguments, CN d\u00e9clare que le fait de rouvrir l'affaire ne causerait aucun pr\u00e9judice aux autres parties et que la question soulev\u00e9e dans la requ\u00eate est fondamentalement une question d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers CN. CN doit comprendre que l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 est juste et convenable et qu'elle joue dans les deux sens. Les plaignantes et la Commission ont le droit d'\u00eatre trait\u00e9es et jug\u00e9es avec la m\u00eame \u00e9quit\u00e9 que CN. CN avait le contr\u00f4le des renseignements. CN a eu deux occasions d'interroger Mme Storms et ses autres t\u00e9moins au sujet des documents. Les t\u00e9moins de CN ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail au sujet de ces documents. CN a eu enti\u00e8rement l'occasion de corriger les renseignements s'ils \u00e9taient inexacts. Elle ne l'a fait qu'\u00e0 la derni\u00e8re journ\u00e9e d'audience, lorsque son avocat a soulev\u00e9 le fait que certains des renseignements pouvaient \u00eatre inexacts, sans donner de d\u00e9tails. CN ne peut pas maintenant soutenir que le rejet de sa requ\u00eate serait in\u00e9quitable envers elle.\n[52] Apr\u00e8s un examen attentif des documents et des arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, le Tribunal est d'avis que CN n'a pas satisfait au crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans la jurisprudence pour la r\u00e9ouverture d'une audience dans le but de pr\u00e9senter de nouvelles preuves. En particulier, elle n'a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'elle a fait preuve de diligence raisonnable pour obtenir la preuve \u00e0 temps pour l'audience.\n[53] Pour ces motifs, la requ\u00eate de CN est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par Michel Doucet OTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 23 mars 2010\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1354\/8408 et T1356\/8608\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Kasha A.

Chotalia, Q.C. 2010 TCDP 7 2010\/03\/24\n[1] Le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la requ\u00eate du Conseil Mushkegowuk (l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e) visant l'obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, ainsi que les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse et la r\u00e9ponse de l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 ces observations, et il a examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence cit\u00e9e par les parties.\nPouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires [2] L'article 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) donne au Tribunal le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d'accorder, \u00e0 l'instruction, le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 des gouvernements, des organismes et des personnes.\n[3] Le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que l'instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[4] L'article 8 des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne pr\u00e9voit qu'une partie peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate afin d'\u00eatre reconnue comme partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\nDe quelle fa\u00e7on l'expertise aide-t-elle le Tribunal? [5] L'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e dans l'instance semble d\u00e9couler principalement d'une instance distincte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 laquelle elle participe, dont les faits sont diff\u00e9rents - notamment le financement et la prestation de services policiers (la plainte portant sur les services policiers).\n[6] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traiter la plainte portant sur les services policiers, et cette d\u00e9cision fait pr\u00e9sentement l'objet d'une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l'intim\u00e9.\n[7] L'affaire en l'instance, qui porte sur les services \u00e0 l'enfance et \u00e0 la famille, comprend six participants, y compris la CCDP, deux organismes plaignants et deux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. De plus, la requ\u00eate de l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e beaucoup plus tard que les requ\u00eates des parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es confirm\u00e9es.\n[8] La position de l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e au sujet des questions de services et de comparaisons est d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien d\u00e9fendue par les deux organismes plaignants. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte portant sur les services policiers n'est pas assimilable \u00e0 une expertise qui aiderait le Tribunal au del\u00e0 de l'expertise d\u00e9j\u00e0 fournie par les parties et les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es confirm\u00e9es. Compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il dispose, le Tribunal n'est pas convaincu que l'intervention propos\u00e9e apporterait d'importants nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments \u00e0 la position des parties existantes. Les parties en l'esp\u00e8ce traiteront ad\u00e9quatement cette position.\nPossibilit\u00e9 de prolonger l'instance [9] Pour la pr\u00e9sente instance, le Tribunal doit examiner une grande quantit\u00e9 de mat\u00e9riel concret, m\u00eame pour trancher la requ\u00eate de l'intim\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de comp\u00e9tence.\n[10] La participation de l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e9largirait l'\u00e9tendue des faits \u00e0 examiner en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[11] La pr\u00e9sentation d'observations \u00e9crites de l'\u00e9ventuelle partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, sans comparution, soul\u00e8ve un tout autre ensemble de d\u00e9fis en mati\u00e8re de logistique, qui causeraient des retards: p. ex. le Tribunal ne pourrait pas interroger les avocats, il devrait demander des r\u00e9ponses \u00e9crites et ensuite fournir du temps aux parties et aux parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es confirm\u00e9es pour qu'elles y r\u00e9pondent, ce qui prolongerait n\u00e9cessairement la proc\u00e9dure et retarderait le r\u00e8glement de l'affaire.\n[12] La pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure comprend d\u00e9j\u00e0 des obstacles importants et exceptionnels en mati\u00e8re de gestion de l'instance, pour les parties autant que pour le Tribunal. Le fait d'accorder le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ne ferait qu'augmenter ces obstacles.\n[13] De plus, tout avantage pr\u00e9tendu est neutralis\u00e9 par le retard raisonnablement anticip\u00e9 dans la tenue des audiences pr\u00e9liminaires et de toute audience sur le fond.\n[14] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate visant l'obtention du statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e.\nSigned by Shirish P.

INTRODUCTION [1] En d\u00e9cembre 2008, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne renvoie au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne la plainte #20060812 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Monsieur Ramanan Thambiah \u00e0 l'encontre de l'Association des Employeurs Maritimes (l'AEM) le 2 janvier 2007.\n[2] Par cette plainte, le plaignant se dit victime de discrimination sur la base de son ethnicit\u00e9 , de son \u00e2ge et de sa situation familiale .\n[3] Ces trois motifs de discrimination pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l'article (2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne sont proscrits par l'article (7) de cette m\u00eame Loi.\n[4] En janvier 2006, au moment o\u00f9 se produisent les faits en litige, le plaignant travaille comme d\u00e9bardeur au Port de Montr\u00e9al depuis sept ans; il a jusqu'alors accumul\u00e9 plus de 10 000 heures de travail.\n[5] En octobre 2005, il devient admissible \u00e0 un poste dans la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien pouvant \u00e9ventuellement lui donner la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi.\n[6] En d\u00e9cembre 2005, il passe avec succ\u00e8s le test OLIFT, ce qui le qualifie pour la conduite du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur, premier des deux tests permettant l'acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve.\n[7] Le second test est connu comme \u00e9tant le OTUGM, qui permet \u00e0 un candidat de se qualifier pour conduire un camion.\n[8] Il \u00e9choue le 25 janvier 2006 le premier examen pour le camion et all\u00e8gue que l'\u00e9valuateur, en tenant une cam\u00e9ra interf\u00e9rait ainsi avec ses mouvements et que d'autre part, il l'a fait changer de direction \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute, ce qui a caus\u00e9 l'incident reproch\u00e9. Il reproche \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuateur d'avoir agi de la sorte dans le seul dessein de saboter son examen.\n[9] \u00c0 quelques reprises, il admet avoir heurt\u00e9 un conteneur avec son camion au cours de ce premier examen et \u00e0 quelques reprises nie avoir heurt\u00e9 ledit conteneur; dans ce dernier cas, il accuse le formateur d'avoir frapp\u00e9 l'arri\u00e8re de son camion avec un marteau ou un \u00e9metteur-r\u00e9cepteur portatif, pour cr\u00e9er un bruit et pouvoir ensuite l'accuser d'avoir heurt\u00e9 le conteneur. Il admet ne pas avoir vu le formateur poser ce geste, mais c'est ce qu'il en d\u00e9duit.\n[10] Il \u00e9choue le 26 janvier 2006 le second examen pour la conduite du camion au motif que les reflets du soleil dans les miroirs du camion l'ont emp\u00each\u00e9 de r\u00e9ussir certaines manuvres et que les freins de la remorque \u00e9taient d\u00e9fectueux.\n[11] Il d\u00e9plore que, malgr\u00e9 ses demandes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es, l'\u00e9valuateur de l'AEM refuse de lui donner la permission de se soumettre \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me test, au motif que la politique de l'entreprise limite \u00e0 deux le nombre des examens et qu'il ne peut aller \u00e0 l'encontre de celle-ci.\n[12] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue avoir ignor\u00e9 tout de cette politique qui n'autorisait pas le droit \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me examen, qu'on l'a induit en erreur en lui faisant croire que le nombre de reprises \u00e9tait illimit\u00e9; il d\u00e9plore que cette politique ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie dans le seul but de le couler.\n[13] Il all\u00e8gue qu'il est de notori\u00e9t\u00e9 publique parmi les d\u00e9bardeurs du Port de Montr\u00e9al que beaucoup de candidats ont pu obtenir un poste de d\u00e9bardeur \u00e0 cause des liens de famille qui les unissent avec des membres influents de l'AEM.\n[14] Pour d\u00e9montrer cette affirmation, il rapporte le cas d'un candidat qui, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises le test du camion, aurait eu droit \u00e0 une troisi\u00e8me reprise, uniquement parce qu'il \u00e9tait le conjoint d'une employ\u00e9e qui travaille dans les bureaux de l'AEM.\n[15] Il all\u00e8gue qu'\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son absence de lien familial avec un membre de l'AEM, on l'a fait \u00e9chouer les deux tests du camion; il conclue faire l'objet d'un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel et discriminatoire.\n[16] Il all\u00e8gue appartenir \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible, \u00eatre \u00e2g\u00e9 de plus de cinquante ans et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de propos racistes.\n[17] Il affirme que les cons\u00e9quences du refus de le laisser se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me examen sont dramatiques pour lui sur le plan financier; cela signifie qu'il ne pourra jamais avoir droit \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi du poste de d\u00e9bardeur et ne pourra pas profiter des avantages, notamment p\u00e9cuniaires accord\u00e9s aux d\u00e9bardeurs avec s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi.\n[18] \u00c0 titre de redressement, le plaignant demande notamment une modification des politiques d'embauche et d'\u00e9valuation de l'AEM, l'annulation du r\u00e9sultat de ses deux premiers tests pour le camion ainsi que le droit \u00e0 une compensation mon\u00e9taire.\n[19] Avant de s'interroger sur le fond de la plainte, c'est-\u00e0-dire sur la violation possible, par l'intim\u00e9e de l'article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, le Tribunal fera l'examen des demandes pr\u00e9liminaires qui lui furent soumises au d\u00e9but de l'audience.\nII. L'OBJET DE LA PLAINTE [20] Dans sa plainte, le plaignant affirme \u00eatre victime de discrimination sur la base de son ethnicit\u00e9 , de son \u00e2ge et de sa situation familiale ; ce dernier motif prenant la forme de n\u00e9potisme, au motif que l'AEM aurait rejet\u00e9 sa candidature au profit de candidats li\u00e9s par des liens familiaux \u00e0 des membres du personnel de direction de l'AEM;\n[21] Au cours de son expos\u00e9 initial, Me Deborah Mankovitz, procureure du plaignant, indique qu'elle entend faire la d\u00e9monstration de chacun des trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte de son client.\n[22] Cependant, \u00e0 la fin de l'interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins des parties et imm\u00e9diatement avant de commencer son plaidoyer, apr\u00e8s r\u00e9flexion et consultation avec son client, Me Mankovitz informe le tribunal qu'elle a pris la d\u00e9cision de laisser tomber la partie de la plainte portant sur l'ethnicit\u00e9 et sur l'\u00e2ge .\n[23] Elle pr\u00e9cise que son plaidoyer portera donc sur un seul motif de discrimination, c'est-\u00e0-dire la situation de famille , qu'elle qualifie tout au cours de l'audience comme \u00e9tant rien d'autre que du n\u00e9potisme.\nIII. DEMANDES PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES [24] Le 6 janvier 2010, cinq jours avant le d\u00e9but de l'audience pr\u00e9vue pour la semaine du 11 au 15 janvier 2009, le Syndicat canadien de la Fonction Publique, repr\u00e9sentant du Syndicat des D\u00e9bardeurs du Port de Montr\u00e9al, demande par \u00e9crit au Tribunal le droit d'\u00eatre reconnu comme personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Il justifie sa demande en all\u00e9guant qu'il vient \u00e0 peine de prendre connaissance de la tenue de l'audience du dossier Ramanan Thambiah v. l'AEM devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne.\n[25] Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, Me Edith Laperle, procureure du Syndicat, pr\u00e9cise que son client, pour le moment, revendique le droit d'assister \u00e0 l'audience en tant que personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e et de recevoir copie des documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve, sans demander d'\u00eatre entendu, sans r\u00e9clamer le droit de faire entendre des t\u00e9moins et sans droit de contre interroger les t\u00e9moins des deux parties.\n[26] Elle ajoute cependant que, dans l'\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 des accusations seraient port\u00e9es contre le Syndicat des d\u00e9bardeurs, celui-ci soumettrait alors une demande au Tribunal pour pouvoir administrer de la preuve.\n[27] Me Deborah Mankovitz, procureure du plaignant, et Me Daniel Leduc, procureur de l'intim\u00e9e, consentent \u00e0 la demande de Me Laperle.\n[28] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ne participe pas \u00e0 l'audience.\n[29] Le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment au droit qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l'article 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, satisfait de l'explication fournie par Me Laperle justifiant sa demande d'intervention tardive et les motifs la justifiant, reconna\u00eet donc le Syndicat comme personne int\u00e9ress\u00e9e avec le pouvoir d'\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent au cours de l'audience. Il se r\u00e9serve aussi le droit de prendre tout autre d\u00e9cision concernant la possibilit\u00e9 d'\u00e9largir ce pouvoir, sur demande du syndicat, selon les circonstances.\n[30] La demande d'exclusion des t\u00e9moins formul\u00e9e d'un commun accord par les procureurs des deux parties est accord\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal.\nIV. R\u00d4LE DE L'AEM, MAIN D'UVRE DE L'AEM & ACCESSION \u00c0 LA 2e & 1\u00e8re R\u00c9SERVE DE SOUTIEN [31] Afin de comprendre la nature de la revendication du plaignant, d\u00e9bardeur de profession au Port de Montr\u00e9al et le contexte dans lequel \u00e9volue celui-ci, il est essentiel de comprendre a) la raison d'\u00eatre de l'AEM, b) la main d'uvre utilis\u00e9e par l'AEM au port de Montr\u00e9al et c) l'accession \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me et \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien.\n[32] Le procureur de l'intim\u00e9e, aux paragraphes (1.1) \u00e0 (1.22) de son Expos\u00e9 des faits, produit avant l'audience, explicite justement avec multes d\u00e9tails les 3 \u00e9l\u00e9ments ci-haut mentionn\u00e9s.\n[33] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les deux parties, au d\u00e9but de l'audience se sont mis d'accord sur la justesse de chacun des paragraphes (1.1) \u00e0 (1.22), il y a lieu de les lire; ceux-ci sont donc reproduits textuellement ci-dessous :\nA- LES FAITS PERTINENTS\n1. L'ASSOCIATION DES EMPLOYEURS MARITIMES\na) La raison d'\u00eatre de l'Association des employeurs maritimes\n1.1 L'Association des employeurs maritimes (AEM) est une association dont fait partie l'ensemble des compagnies qui uvrent dans le domaine du d\u00e9bardage de diff\u00e9rents ports de 1'Est du Canada, dont le Port de Montr\u00e9al.\n1.2 Ainsi, sur une base journali\u00e8re, l'AEM re\u00e7oit de chaque compagnie de d\u00e9bardage dans le Port de Montr\u00e9al, sa commande de main-d'uvre pour la journ\u00e9e qui va suivre, laquelle commande sp\u00e9cifie la classification requise, eu \u00e9gard au travail \u00e0 effectuer chez cette compagnie.\n1.3 Dans ce contexte, 1'AEM a pour principale mission de proc\u00e9der au recrutement, \u00e0 la formation et au d\u00e9ploiement de la main-d'uvre chez les diff\u00e9rentes compagnies uvrant dans le domaine du d\u00e9bardage dans le Port de Montr\u00e9al.\nb) La main d'uvre\n1.4 Pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins desdites compagnies, 1'AEM se doit de d\u00e9tenir un bassin de main-d'uvre d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9.\n1.5 I1 existe trois cat\u00e9gories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d'employ\u00e9s \u00e0 l'emploi de 1'AEM. Elles sont : les employ\u00e9s couverts par la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi (plus ou moins huit cent quatre-vingt (880) employ\u00e9s), les employ\u00e9s de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien (plus ou moins quatre-vingt-dix (90) employ\u00e9s) et les employ\u00e9s de la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien (plus ou moins trente (30) employ\u00e9s).\n1.6 Un nouvel employ\u00e9 qui acc\u00e8de \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien passera, sujet \u00e0 l'obtention de certaines classifications, \u00e0 plus ou moins long terme \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien et, enfin, au groupe couvert par la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi.\n1.7 Les employ\u00e9s de l'AEM, peu importe leur cat\u00e9gorie, ex\u00e9cutent tous une seule fonction, soit celle de d\u00e9bardeur, cette fonction est par ailleurs divis\u00e9e en diff\u00e9rentes classifications.\n1.8 La liste de la presque totalit\u00e9 des classifications constituant le travail de d\u00e9bardage se retrouve aux pages 66 & 69 de la convention collective entre l'Association des employeurs maritimes et le Syndicat des d\u00e9bardeurs, Section local 375, expiration : 31 d\u00e9cembre 2008 (Convention collective ).\n1.9 Certaines classifications susmentionn\u00e9es sont obligatoires pour les employ\u00e9s qui acc\u00e8dent \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien et \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien, \u00e0 savoir :\nClassifications obligatoires :\n2\u00e8me r\u00e9serve PCALE : EPAND : ELING : OLASH : SCHRP : pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 la cale; \u00e9pandeur; \u00e9lingueur; pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 au s\u00e9curage; charpentier de seine;\n1\u00e8re r\u00e9serve les m\u00eames classifications que pour la 2\u00e8me r\u00e9serve plus les suivantes :\nOLIFT : op\u00e9rateur de chariot-\u00e9l\u00e9vateur - 13 tonnes et moins;\nPLIFT : op\u00e9rateur de chariot-\u00e9l\u00e9vateur - 13 tonnes et moins dans la cale;\nOBLOC : op\u00e9rateur de chariot-\u00e9l\u00e9vateur - 13 tonnes et moins et pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux blocs;\nOTUGM : op\u00e9rateur de camion.\n1.10 L'obligation des employ\u00e9s de la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien d'obtenir les classifications d'op\u00e9rateur de chariot-\u00e9l\u00e9vateur et d'op\u00e9rateur de camion sont notamment pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l'article 13.08 de la Convention collective.\n1.11 La classification d'op\u00e9rateur de camion qui est une condition sine qua non \u00e0 l'accession \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien fait partie des formations dispens\u00e9es par 1'AEM.\n1.12 En plus des trois cat\u00e9gories g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d'employ\u00e9s mentionn\u00e9es au paragraphe 1.5, 1'AEM utilise les services de personnes d\u00e9tentrices d'une carte blanche afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins ponctuels de main-d'uvre.\n1.13 La carte blanche est une pi\u00e8ce d'identit\u00e9 qui permet \u00e0 son d\u00e9tenteur de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 la salle d'embauche de 1'AEM dans l'espoir d'obtenir du travail de d\u00e9bardeur pour une journ\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, advenant que les d\u00e9bardeurs couverts par la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi et\/ou que les d\u00e9bardeurs de la premi\u00e8re et deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien soient en nombre insuffisant pour satisfaire aux besoins du jour en mati\u00e8re de d\u00e9bardage.\n1.14 La proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre consiste pour chacun des d\u00e9tenteurs d'une carte blanche (plus ou moins cent (100) d\u00e9tenteurs) qui d\u00e9sirent du travail, de se pr\u00e9senter la salle d'embauche de 1'AEM au d\u00e9but d'un quart de travail et d'offrir ses services en pr\u00e9sentant sa carte blanche , qui n'est rien d'autre qu'une carte d'identification permettant \u00e0 1' AEM d'identifier la personne qui offre ses services.\nc) L'accession \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me et \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien\n1.15 Lorsqu'une place se lib\u00e8re sur la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien, 1'AEM doit s'en remettre \u00e0 une Liste des candidats aux r\u00e9serves de soutien .\n1.16 Cette Liste est pr\u00e9par\u00e9e par le Syndicat des d\u00e9bardeurs, SCFP, section locale 375 (Syndicat ) et les noms qui y apparaissent peuvent ou ne peuvent pas \u00eatre d\u00e9tenteurs d'une carte blanche .\n1.17 Ainsi, \u00e0 chaque fois que 1'AEM a un ou des postes \u00e0 combler \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien, le Syndicat fait parvenir une lettre \u00e0 l'AEM, d\u00fbment sign\u00e9e par le candidat admissible, l'informant de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du candidat \u00e0 postuler pour un poste \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien.\n1.18 Sur r\u00e9ception de cette lettre d\u00fbment sign\u00e9 1'AEM initie le processus d'embauche, qui implique notamment :\n1.18.1 assujettissement des candidats \u00e0 des tests d'aptitude;\n1.18.2 assujettissement \u00e0 un examen m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9embauche afin de v\u00e9rifier si le candidat rencontre les exigences psychologiques, physiques et m\u00e9dicales lui permettant d'occuper la fonction de d\u00e9bardeur; et\n1.18.3 v\u00e9rification des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents criminels.\n1.19 Ces exigences sont notamment pr\u00e9vues a l'article 13.07 de la Convention collective.\n1.20 L'accession \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien se fait essentiellement par attrition, \u00e0 savoir des d\u00e9missions volontaires, des cong\u00e9diements et la retraite des employ\u00e9s couverts par la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d'emploi.\n1.21 Le bassin de main-d'uvre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 pour un poste \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien sont les employ\u00e9s sur la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve de soutien.\n1.22 L'accession \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien, tel que mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 1.10 est conditionnelle \u00e0 la d\u00e9tention des classifications, d'op\u00e9rateur de chariot-\u00e9l\u00e9vateur et d'op\u00e9rateur de camion.\nV. CRIT\u00c8RES JURIDIQUES APPLICABLES [34] Le plaignant, suite \u00e0 sa plainte, a dans un premier temps l'obligation de convaincre le tribunal de l'existence d'une preuve prima facie de discrimination de la part de l'intim\u00e9e. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et al. c. La municipalit\u00e9 d'Etobicoke, [1982] 1 R.C.S. 202). Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, comme le plaignant a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 discrimination bas\u00e9e sur la situation de famille , qui peut se pr\u00e9senter sous la forme de n\u00e9potisme, il devra convaincre le tribunal que la preuve soumise se rapportant aux all\u00e9gations faites, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante comme l'enseigne la Cour Supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O'Malley c. Simpson-Sears Ltd. [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, paragraphe 28 :\nDans les instances devant un tribunal des droits de la personne, le plaignant doit faire une preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire qu'il y a discrimination. Dans ce contexte, la preuve suffisante jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9.\n[35] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision \u00e0 cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape, le tribunal doit se limiter \u00e0 l'analyse de la seule preuve tant testimoniale que documentaire d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant. Il doit faire abstraction de la preuve soumise par l'intim\u00e9e \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9ponse. Voir \u00e0 cet effet Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd2004 CAF 204 au par. 22 :\n[22] L'approche adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal et confirm\u00e9e par le juge du proc\u00e8s afin de d\u00e9cider si le demandeur avait \u00e9tabli une preuve prima facie de discrimination n'est pas appuy\u00e9e par la jurisprudence. La preuve prima facie produite par l'appelant \u00e9tablissait qu'il avait pos\u00e9 sa candidature \u00e0 un poste de chef m\u00e9canicien sur le N.M. Princess of Acadia , qu'il poss\u00e9dait les qualit\u00e9s requises pour ce poste, qu'une autre personne avait obtenu le poste et que sa race avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de l'intim\u00e9e d'embaucher les autres candidats. Dans ces all\u00e9gations, l'appelant aurait pu \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, savoir une preuve : qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de l'employeur intim\u00e9. Au lieu de d\u00e9cider si ces all\u00e9gations, si elles \u00e9taient crues, justifiaient un verdict favorable \u00e0 l'appelant, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement tenu compte de la r\u00e9ponse de l'intim\u00e9e avant de conclure qu'une preuve prima facie n'avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Comme il d\u00e9coule clairement de l'arr\u00eat Etobicoke, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9 et de l'arr\u00eat O'Malley, ce dernier \u00e9l\u00e9ment ne joue aucun r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination de la question de savoir si une preuve prima facie de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[36] Si le tribunal juge qu'il y a absence d'une preuve prima facie par rapport \u00e0 un \u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel des all\u00e9gations ou juge la preuve soumise incompl\u00e8te ou insatisfaisante, il devra rejeter la plainte. Voir C.C.D.P. c. C.N. (2000) 38 C.H.R.R.D\/107 (C.F.). Dans les faits, c'est vraiment une question de savoir si chaque aspect essentiel de l'acte discriminatoire est appuy\u00e9 par un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve.\n[37] Pour \u00e9tablir cette preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant doit offrir davantage que des g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations h\u00e2tives. Voir \u00e0 cet effet, la d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans Singh c. Canada (Statistiques Canada) (1998) D.C.D.P. no 7, au paragraphe 197.\n[38] Il n'est pas suffisant de se dire victime de discrimination et d'en \u00eatre convaincu pour conclure \u00e0 la discrimination sans en \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. Voir \u00e0 cet effet, la d\u00e9cision du tribunal dans Singh c. Canada (Statistiques Canada) (1998) D.C.D.P. no 7, au paragraphe 206.\n[39] Par contre, s'il est d'avis qu'une preuve prima facie a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite, les cons\u00e9quences seront que le fardeau de la preuve se d\u00e9place. Il incombe alors \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e de fournir des explications raisonnables ou satisfaisantes quant \u00e0 la pratique par ailleurs discriminatoire (Voir Lincoln c. Bay Ferries Ltd, 2004 CAF 204 (CANLII), 2004 CAF 204, paragraphe 23; Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 CAF 154 (CANLII), 2005 caf 154, paragraphes 26 et 27).\n[40] Par ailleurs, la conduite d'un employeur ne sera pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant discriminatoire si celui-ci peut d\u00e9montrer que ses refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences d\u00e9coulent d'exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es (EPJ) (alin\u00e9a 15 (1) a) de la Loi). Pour qu'une pratique soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une EPJ, il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d'une personne ou d'une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (paragraphe 15 (2) de la Loi).\n[41] L'intim\u00e9e doit \u00e9galement prouver que la justification n'est pas un simple pr\u00e9texte pour masquer une pratique discriminatoire. Ainsi en a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Canada (P.G.) c. Lambie (1996) 29 C.H.R.R. D\/483.\n[42] Le degr\u00e9 de preuve exig\u00e9 pour juger de l'existence ou de la non-existence de la discrimination est celui qu'on exige dans les dossiers de nature civile, c'est-\u00e0-dire la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de preuve. Les exigences d'une telle preuve sont moins grandes que celles exig\u00e9es devant un tribunal qui si\u00e8ge en mati\u00e8re criminelle. Voici ce que le tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l'arr\u00eat Dawson c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes 2008 TCDP 41 au paragraphe 73 :\n[73] Cela dit, comme on peut le lire dans la d\u00e9cision Wall c. Kitigan Zibi Education Council, [1997] C.C.D.P. no 6, la norme de preuve dans les affaires de discrimination reste la norme civile ordinaire de la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s et, s'agissant de la preuve circonstancielle, le crit\u00e8re est le suivant : on peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination quand la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appui rend cette conclusion plus probable que n'importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se (B. Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Carwell, 1987, page 142).\n[43] Dans les faits, les plaignants se voient confront\u00e9s \u00e0 une dure r\u00e9alit\u00e9. En l'absence d'une preuve directe, ils doivent s'en remettre \u00e0 une preuve circonstancielle. Voir \u00e0 cet effet la d\u00e9cision Basi c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, (1988) D.C.D.P. no 2.\n[44] Le plaignant, pour avoir gain de cause, doit \u00e9galement \u00e9tablir un lien de causalit\u00e9 entre les \u00e9checs subis \u00e0 l'occasion des deux examens portant la conduite du camion et le motif de discrimination invoqu\u00e9, c'est-\u00e0-dire la situation de famille (n\u00e9potisme). Voir \u00e0 cet effet la d\u00e9cision Chopra c. Canada (P.G.), 2007 CAF 268.\nVI. CR\u00c9DIBILIT\u00c9 DU PLAIGNANT [45] Nous relevons un grand nombre de contradictions dans le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant et jugeons utile de reproduire dans le pr\u00e9sent jugement quelques-unes de celles-ci jug\u00e9es plus importantes.\n[46] Le plaignant admet \u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 ses \u00e9checs lors des deux examens du camion, les nie \u00e0 un autre moment donn\u00e9 et finalement tente de les justifier en formulant des hypoth\u00e8ses non v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es ni v\u00e9rifiables qui fluctuent avec le temps.\n[47] Jugeant les cons\u00e9quences de son \u00e9chec tellement disproportionn\u00e9es par rapport \u00e0 la faute reproch\u00e9e, il cherche d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment \u00e0 trouver des solutions pour se sortir de cette impasse.\n[48] Il laisse l'impression d'une personne d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par les cons\u00e9quences de son \u00e9chec, qui tente d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment de comprendre ce qui a bien pu lui arriver. Au cours de l'audience, il expose tout haut le fruit de cette r\u00e9flexion. Il en arrive \u00e0 formuler un certain nombre d'hypoth\u00e8ses.\n[49] Selon lui, la discrimination et le sabotage de la part du formateur et de l'\u00e9valuateur expliqueraient en partie ses deux \u00e9checs. Plusieurs facteurs externes expliqueraient \u00e9galement ces m\u00eames \u00e9checs. Lorsqu'il t\u00e9moigne, il tire donc dans toutes les directions. Ses hypoth\u00e8ses sont parfois difficilement imaginables et encore moins v\u00e9rifiables.\n[50] Finalement, le plaignant formule peu de faits concrets pour soutenir sa position et se r\u00e9fugie principalement derri\u00e8re des hypoth\u00e8ses ou sur du ou\u00ef-dire.\n[51] Par son t\u00e9moignage, le plaignant d\u00e9montre clairement avoir de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 distinguer entre les faits de son cas et les hypoth\u00e8ses qui pourraient expliquer ces faits.\n[52] En dernier ressort, il est difficile d'accorder beaucoup de poids \u00e0 la version du plaignant lorsque celle-ci est confront\u00e9e \u00e0 celle d'un t\u00e9moin qui t\u00e9moigne sur des faits dont il a une connaissance personnelle.\n[53] Bref, selon nous, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant est tr\u00e8s faible.\n[54] Nous proc\u00e9dons maintenant \u00e0 l'analyse des diff\u00e9rentes questions de fond qui se sont pos\u00e9es au cours de l'audience.\nVII. QUESTIONS DE FOND [55] Il est important de v\u00e9rifier ce qui s'est pass\u00e9 les 25 et 26 janvier 2006, au cours des deux examens de conduite du camion effectu\u00e9s par le plaignant.\n[56] Les deux seules personnes qui t\u00e9moignent sur ces deux examens furent messieurs le plaignant, et Monsieur M., le pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuation, \u00e9galement directeur des relations de travail et de la main d'uvre chez l'AEM.\n[57] Le plaignant explique ce qui s'est produit au cours de ses deux examens et pourquoi il a demand\u00e9 de pouvoir subir un troisi\u00e8me examen qui lui fut refus\u00e9 par le repr\u00e9sentant de l'AEM.\nA. Analyse du 1er \u00e9chec (25 janvier 2006) [58] Dans une lettre du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2006 adress\u00e9e au vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'AEM, produite comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R1, onglet 7, le plaignant reconna\u00eet qu'au cours de sa premi\u00e8re tentative, soit le 25 janvier 2006, ... j'ai accroch\u00e9 un conteneur. Par contre, il met le bl\u00e2me sur Monsieur M., l'\u00e9valuateur qui aurait mis la main sur le devant de son camion et lui aurait demand\u00e9 de changer de direction.\n[59] Dans le Bref r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits produit par son procureur, on y lit au paragraphe (6) ce qui suit :\n6. Sa premi\u00e8re tentative a \u00e9t\u00e9 infructueuse. Au cours du test, l'\u00e9valuateur tenait une cam\u00e9ra qui interf\u00e9rait avec ses mouvements.\n[60] Dans une lettre du 19 octobre 2007 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e de la CCDP, en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'incident du 25 janvier 2006 produite comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R1, onglet 11, \u00e0 la page 2, il \u00e9crit de nouveau: there was an accrochage but no containers had moved only a claque sound .\n[61] Par contre, lors de l'audience, il nie avoir heurt\u00e9 le conteneur, mais reconna\u00eet qu'il y a eu un bruit. Il ne voit qu'une seule explication pour expliquer ce bruit: Monsieur L., le formateur, qui \u00e9tait derri\u00e8re le camion, aurait ass\u00e9n\u00e9 un coup de marteau ou un coup avec son walkie-talkie sur l'arri\u00e8re de son camion. Il explique \u00e9galement avoir vu Monsieur L., par la suite, remettre son marteau en place.\n[62] Il affirme que Monsieur L. lui aurait alors dit : Tu as accroch\u00e9 .\n[63] Au cours de l'audience, le plaignant a laiss\u00e9 entendre que s'il avait heurt\u00e9 le conteneur avec son camion, celui-ci aurait boug\u00e9 car il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s facile de le faire bouger puisqu'il \u00e9tait sur la glace. Que m\u00eame lui aurait pu le faire bouger \u00e0 la main.\n[64] Le t\u00e9moin M. est venu dire qu'un homme aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de d\u00e9placer le conteneur \u00e0 la main, parce que celui-ci p\u00e8se plusieurs milliers de livres, qu'il \u00e9tait sur place depuis tr\u00e8s longtemps, que ses pattes devaient \u00eatre ancr\u00e9es dans l'asphalte \u00e0 cause de sa pesanteur et parce que la chaleur de l'\u00e9t\u00e9 ramollit l'asphalte et finalement, qu'au moment de l'incident, le conteneur \u00e9tait pris dans la glace.\n[65] Le tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de v\u00e9rifier cette derni\u00e8re explication lors de la visualisation de la vid\u00e9o et est d'avis que le conteneur aurait difficilement pu bouger m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 heurt\u00e9 par un camion.\n[66] Monsieur M., qui \u00e9tait devant le camion, est venu dire qu'il avait entendu le bruit, tout comme Monsieur Thambiah, d'ailleurs.\n[67] Il pr\u00e9cisa que Monsieur L., qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 ses c\u00f4t\u00e9s lors de l'incident, n'avait pas de marteau avec lui et qu'il est impensable de frapper un conteneur avec un walkie-talkie puisque celui-ci est fabriqu\u00e9 de plastic et aurait pu briser facilement.\n[68] Monsieur M. ajouta que la r\u00e9putation de Monsieur L., qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'approche de la retraite, \u00e9tait sans tache; qu'aucun reproche ni plainte n'apparaissait \u00e0 son dossier, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s avoir particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des centaines d'examens.\n[69] Pour Monsieur M., il est clair que le plaignant avait heurt\u00e9 le conteneur avec son camion.\n[70] Quant \u00e0 l'examen de la vid\u00e9o de cet incident, puisqu'il n'y a pas d'audio, il est impossible de faire de commentaire sur le bruit qu'il pourrait y avoir eu. Mais ceci ne pose aucun probl\u00e8me puisque m\u00eame le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir entendu le bruit.\n[71] Il est \u00e9galement impossible de dire, suite \u00e0 la visualisation de la vid\u00e9o, de fa\u00e7on certaine si effectivement le camion a heurt\u00e9 ou non le conteneur; chose certaine, il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s du conteneur.\n[72] Par contre, nous sommes d'avis que Monsieur M. \u00e9tait bien plac\u00e9 pour voir ce qui s'est produit et affirmer que le plaignant avait heurt\u00e9 le conteneur. Nous retenons sa version.\n[73] De plus, Monsieur M. est venu dire au tribunal que lorsqu'un candidat \u00e0 un examen heurte un conteneur, la r\u00e8gle est que le candidat \u00e9choue automatiquement.\nB. Analyse du 2e \u00e9chec (26 janvier 2006) [74] Dans sa lettre du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2006 adress\u00e9e \u00e0 Monsieur Jean B\u00e9dard, vice-pr\u00e9sident de l'AEM, produite comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R1, onglet 7, le plaignant justifie son 2e \u00e9chec subi 26 janvier 2006 de la fa\u00e7on suivante :\nLa deuxi\u00e8me fois (vers deux heures) \u00e0 cause du soleil qui allait coucher, le soleil \u00e9tait 45 Degr\u00e9 de sol et avait perpendiculairement dans mes yeux. Il m'a emp\u00each\u00e9e de voir le miroir correctement. Apr\u00e8s des quatre fois de tentatives de recul, Je ne me suis pas arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 reculer m\u00eame une seule foi!!\n[75] Nous avons examin\u00e9 attentivement la vid\u00e9o de l'examen du 26 janvier, en portant un il attentif sur le sol afin d'y d\u00e9celer des indices nous permettant de tirer une conclusion quant \u00e0 la position du soleil. Ne voyant aucune ombre autour d'objets tels que les c\u00f4nes d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au sol, il est difficile de pr\u00e9tendre qu'il y avait \u00e0 ce moment pr\u00e9sence du soleil. Du moins, nous ne croyons pas que le soleil pouvait \u00eatre aveuglant.\n[76] Le t\u00e9moin M. est venu d\u00e9clarer qu'il prit connaissance que le plaignant invoquait le soleil comme cause de l'\u00e9chec de son 2e examen seulement lorsqu'il lut la lettre du 7 mars 2006 du plaignant, lettre produite au dossier du tribunal comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R1 onglet 2.\n[77] Le t\u00e9moin M. ne s'est pas rendu compte, au cours de l'examen, que le soleil aurait pu \u00eatre une cause de d\u00e9rangement pour le plaignant. Il all\u00e9gua que le plaignant ne fit alors aucune allusion au probl\u00e8me que lui causait le soleil ni durant ni apr\u00e8s l'examen.\n[78] Et si le soleil avait \u00e9t\u00e9 si d\u00e9rangeant, pourquoi le plaignant n'en a-t-il pas alors fait mention \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuateur? Pourquoi n'a-t-il pas demand\u00e9 d'arr\u00eater l'examen ou encore demand\u00e9 de pouvoir reculer \u00e0 un autre endroit o\u00f9 le soleil ne l'aurait pas d\u00e9rang\u00e9?\n[79] Et pourquoi n'en a-t-il pas fait mention \u00e0 la fin de l'examen lorsque l'\u00e9valuateur lui fit part de l'\u00e9chec de l'examen?\n[80] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement tent\u00e9 d'expliquer son 2e \u00e9chec, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage devant le tribunal, par la d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 des freins de la remorque.\n[81] Le plaignant avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait mention de ce facteur dans un document fourni par le plaignant au Conseil Canadien des Relations de Travail. Voir \u00e0 cet effet la pi\u00e8ce R1, onglet 12, page 6, dont nous reproduisons l'extrait suivant :\nOn the January 26th, I was deliberately provided with the faulty truck where the brakes were partially applied on to the remorque. As a result I wasn't able to reverse on straight line. This resulted in a failure in the second driving test. The sequence of events came to light only after the video footage of the evenements released by the employer (Maritime employers association).\n[82] En r\u00e9action \u00e0 cette mention, le t\u00e9moin M. a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l'effet que cet all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ne pouvait tenir la route parce que ce genre de remorque que conduisait le plaignant n'a pas de freins. Par contre, le camion avait n\u00e9cessairement des freins. Au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, aucun autre candidat ne s'est plaint du mauvais \u00e9tat des freins de ce camion et aucune r\u00e9paration ne fut faire aux dits freins.\n[83] De plus, le plaignant a lui-m\u00eame reconnu que le matin du 26 janvier, le camion fonctionnait bien. Voici ce qu'il a \u00e9crit \u00e0 cet effet dans sa lettre du 7 mars 2006 adress\u00e9e au directeur de la formation, directeur de la formation \u00e0 l'AEM, produite au dossier comme \u00e9tant la pi\u00e8ce R1, onglet 2 :\nJe suis \u00e9chou\u00e9 le camion le jeudi 26 janvier 2006. Quand j'ai pratiqu\u00e9 les matins, je n'avais aucun probl\u00e8me avec le camion.\n[84] Pour notre part, apr\u00e8s un examen attentif de la vid\u00e9o, celle-ci ne nous semble pas corroborer l'affirmation du plaignant \u00e0 l'effet que la vid\u00e9o aurait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu'il y avait un probl\u00e8me avec les freins.\n[85] Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu'a affirm\u00e9 le plaignant, nous sommes d'avis qu'il n'aurait fait aucune mention \u00e0 l'\u00e9valuateur, tant au cours de l'examen qu'imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s, de la d\u00e9fectuosit\u00e9 des freins.\n[86] Nous ne pouvons donc consid\u00e9rer que l'\u00e9tat des freins du camion peut justifier l'\u00e9chec de l'examen de conduite du plaignant.\n[87] Quant \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 du plaignant retrouv\u00e9 dans la citation mentionn\u00e9e plus haut, c'est-\u00e0-dire que I was deliberately provided with the faulty truck where the brakes... , nous sommes d'avis qu'il n'est bas\u00e9 sur rien, si ce n'est sur l'imagination du plaignant qui recherche d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9ment une excuse pour justifier son \u00e9chec.\n[88] Rien dans la preuve soumise ne nous permet de croire que les repr\u00e9sentants de l'AEM aient pu poser quelque geste d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce soit afin de nuire ou de faire \u00e9chouer le plaignant dans son examen.\n[89] Nous tenons plut\u00f4t \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que le plaignant, au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, est venu dire qu'apr\u00e8s avoir r\u00e9ussi l'examen du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur, l'\u00e9valuateur l'avait f\u00e9licit\u00e9 et lui avait donn\u00e9 une tape dans le dos en montrant qu'il \u00e9tait content pour lui. Aucune preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant nous pourrait expliquer pourquoi l'attitude de ce m\u00eame \u00e9valuateur aurait pu changer au point qu'il aurait cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 saboter l'examen du plaignant.\nC. La r\u00e8gle des 2 essais maximums [90] Le plaignant ainsi que le t\u00e9moin P-1 sont venus dire au tribunal qu'ils ignoraient l'existence de la r\u00e8gle des deux essais maximums. Les deux ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que s'ils l'avaient su, ils se seraient pr\u00e9par\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence. Le t\u00e9moin P-1 a, pour sa part, affirm\u00e9 qu'il aurait pris la chose plus au s\u00e9rieux. Les deux ont affirm\u00e9 n'avoir re\u00e7u aucun avis des repr\u00e9sentants de l'AEM \u00e0 cet effet.\n[91] Le t\u00e9moin M., pour sa part, est venu affirmer que cette r\u00e8gle existait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e0 son arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 l'AEM en 1998 mais qu'il ignorait depuis quand elle \u00e9tait en existence.\n[92] Il ajouta que cette r\u00e8gle, non \u00e9crite \u00e0 ses d\u00e9buts, fut mise par \u00e9crite plusieurs mois plus tard, apr\u00e8s l'incident Thambiah, une fois que la p\u00e9riode d'embauche massive fut termin\u00e9e et qu'ils eurent le temps de le faire.\n[93] Confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration du plaignant \u00e0 l'effet qu'il n'avait en aucune occasion \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9venu de l'existence de cette r\u00e8gle, il d\u00e9clara que cette mise en garde \u00e9tait toujours faite durant l'expos\u00e9 th\u00e9orique, tant celui du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur que du camion; cependant, dans chacun de ces cas, il n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sent puisque la formation ne relevait pas de lui.\n[94] Il ajouta que cette mise en garde apparaissait d'ailleurs dans le manuel qui \u00e9tait remis \u00e0 chacun des candidats produit au dossier du tribunal aux pages 14 et 15 de la pi\u00e8ce R-1, onglet (15); pour notre part, nous sommes d'avis que cet all\u00e9gu\u00e9 n'\u00e9tait pas suffisamment clair pour que les candidats puissent s'en rendre compte. De plus, nous croyons que le plaignant aurait re\u00e7u un manuel qui ne comprenait pas cette page 14 et qui diff\u00e9rait du document produit en preuve par le t\u00e9moin M..\n[95] Il d\u00e9clara avoir fait cette mise en garde personnellement au plaignant le 25 janvier et lors du d\u00e9briefing et \u00e0 l'occasion du 1er \u00e9chec subi par le plaignant lors de l'examen du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur.\n[96] \u00c9tant confront\u00e9 aux d\u00e9clarations contradictoires du plaignant et celles du t\u00e9moin M., \u00e9valuateur au dossier, nous optons pour la version de l'\u00e9valuateur. Comme nous l'avons expliqu\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement, la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du plaignant est tr\u00e8s faible.\n[97] Suite aux d\u00e9clarations faites par le plaignant et par quelques-uns de ses t\u00e9moins, \u00e0 l'effet que quelques candidats auraient eu droit \u00e0 3 essais, le t\u00e9moin M. pr\u00e9cisa qu'il n'y eut en fait qu'un seul candidat qui eut droit \u00e0 trois essais, soit celui de Monsieur C-1 dont le cas sera \u00e9tudi\u00e9 plus loin dans le pr\u00e9sent jugement.\n[98] Le tribunal se permet \u00e0 ce moment-ci de pr\u00e9ciser qu'il n'est pas de son ressort, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la nature de la plainte, de se pencher sur la justesse ou la validit\u00e9 de la r\u00e8gle des deux essais maximums.\n[99] En effet, tous les cas soumis pour \u00e9tude au tribunal, incluant celui du plaignant, ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle de deux essais maximum a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e ind\u00e9pendamment de l'\u00e2ge, de l'ethnicit\u00e9 et du lien de famille de ces candidats avec des membres de l'AEM. Par cons\u00e9quent, la r\u00e8gle des deux essais minimums a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e sans discrimination \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du plaignant.\n[100] Le Tribunal, qui, en quelques occasions, a indiqu\u00e9 ne pas vouloir s'ing\u00e9rer dans le processus de dotation \u00e0 moins qu'il n'y ait discrimination, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 deux affaires faisant valoir le principe que toute irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de dotation n'est pas n\u00e9cessairement preuve concluante de discrimination. Ce principe a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9 subs\u00e9quemment dans plusieurs autres d\u00e9cisions (Voir la d\u00e9cision Folch, cit\u00e9e plus r\u00e9cemment dans l'affaire Morin c. Canada (P.G), 2005 CHRT 41. http:\/\/www.canlii.org\/fr\/ca\/tcdp\/doc\/2005\/2005tcdp41\/2005tcdp41.html; la d\u00e9cision Kibale, cit\u00e9e plus r\u00e9cemment dans l'affaire Chopra v. Canada (Sant\u00e9 et Bien-\u00eatre), 2001 CanLII 8492 (T.C.D.P) http:\/\/www.canlii.org\/en\/ca\/chrt\/doc\/2001\/2001canlii8492\/2001canlii8492.html)\nD. Existence du n\u00e9potisme \u00e0 l'AEM [101] Nous ferons maintenant l'\u00e9tude des diff\u00e9rents cas soumis au tribunal afin d'\u00e9valuer s'il y a eu ou non n\u00e9potisme.\n(i) Cas de NS (candidat d'origine maghr\u00e9bine) [102] Quelques-uns des t\u00e9moins entendus, dont le plaignant, font allusion \u00e0 la situation d'un certain candidat d'origine maghr\u00e9bine, que nous identifions comme \u00e9tant Monsieur C-1, mari\u00e9 \u00e0 une employ\u00e9e de bureau de l'AEM, qui, apr\u00e8s deux \u00e9checs, aurait eu droit \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me essai.\n[103] Le t\u00e9moin de l'AEM, Monsieur M., a reconnu que Monsieur C-1 fut le seul candidat \u00e0 avoir droit \u00e0 3 essais et explique ce qui s'est pass\u00e9.\n[104] Apr\u00e8s les deux \u00e9checs subis il rencontra Monsieur C-1 et l'informa qu'en vertu de la r\u00e8gle des deux essais maximums, il n'avait pas droit \u00e0 un troisi\u00e8me essai.\n[105] Par apr\u00e8s, des repr\u00e9sentations furent faites par M. C-1 lui-m\u00eame et par des repr\u00e9sentants du syndicat pour convaincre l'\u00e9valuateur que Monsieur C-1 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9rang\u00e9 au cours de son examen par la pr\u00e9sence d'un autobus qui avait circul\u00e9 sur le terrain o\u00f9 se d\u00e9roulait l'examen, \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 du camion conduit par Monsieur C-1.\n[106] L'\u00e9valuateur accepta de visualiser la vid\u00e9o prise au cours du test de Monsieur C-1. Apr\u00e8s visualisation et apr\u00e8s avoir consid\u00e9r\u00e9 les arguments des intervenants, l'\u00e9valuateur en vint \u00e0 la conclusion qu'effectivement Monsieur avait pu \u00eatre d\u00e9rang\u00e9 par cet incident.\n[107] Attendu que normalement les autres candidats n'ont pas \u00e0 composer avec la pr\u00e9sence de v\u00e9hicules sur le terrain de l'examen, tels que la circulation d'autobus, l'\u00e9valuateur d\u00e9cida d'annuler ce deuxi\u00e8me essai au motif qu'il s'agissait d'une situation particuli\u00e8re et de donner au candidat S.N. un autre essai.\n[108] Celui-ci refit l'examen et le r\u00e9ussit. C'est ainsi qu'AEM lui accorda le droit de conduire un camion au port de Montr\u00e9al.\n[109] Nous sommes satisfaits des explications fournies par le repr\u00e9sentant de l'AEM. Il n'y aurait eu aucune irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de la part de l'AEM dans ce cas.\n(ii) Cas de MB (dame de race blanche) [110] Le t\u00e9moin P-3 a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 devant le tribunal que selon ce qu'il avait entendu, bien qu'il n'e\u00fbt pas une connaissance personnelle de l'incident, Madame C-2 aurait \u00e9chou\u00e9 les tests pour le chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur et quelque temps plus tard, il l'avait vue conduire un camion.\n[111] Le t\u00e9moin P-1, concernant l'incident reli\u00e9 au cas de Madame C-2, et sans pr\u00e9ciser ses sources d'information, est venu dire qu'elle aurait perdu son permis de conduite pour le chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur et le camion et qu'apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u une nouvelle formation, aurait repris son permis pour conduire le camion, quelques mois plus tard.\n[112] Le t\u00e9moin M. d\u00e9clare \u00eatre personnellement au courant de ce dossier, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 l'\u00e9valuateur de cette candidate. Il affirme que Madame C-2 avait r\u00e9ussi dans un premier temps l'examen du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur et dans un second temps, soit le 4 d\u00e9cembre 2006, l'examen du camion. Toutefois, suite \u00e0 un accident qu'elle aurait subi en conduisant le camion, on lui aurait retir\u00e9 sa classification. Elle reprit sa formation et, quelques jours plus tard, on lui redonna sa classification.\n[113] Les t\u00e9moins des deux parties ont fait des d\u00e9clarations contradictoires. Puisque les t\u00e9moins du plaignant n'ont pas eu une connaissance personnelle de l'incident, alors que le t\u00e9moin M., en ayant eu une connaissance personnelle, \u00e9tait le mieux plac\u00e9 pour discuter du dossier de Madame C-2, nous retenons sa version. Il n'y aurait eu aucune irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de la part de l'AEM dans ce cas.\n(iii) Cas de C-4 (dame) [114] Le t\u00e9moin P-2 a racont\u00e9 au tribunal que le conjoint de Madame C-4, une d\u00e9bardeur sur la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve, lui aurait dit que son \u00e9pouse avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test \u00e0 deux reprises. Deux semaines plus tard, il all\u00e8gue l'avoir vu en train de conduire un camion sur le port de Montr\u00e9al. \u00c0 remarquer que c'est dans une grande confusion que ce t\u00e9moin finit par situer l'incident de Madame C-4 dans le temps.\n[115] Le t\u00e9moin M. est venu d\u00e9clarer \u00eatre personnellement au courant de ce dossier. Toutefois, il jugea n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9ciser qu'il connaissait le nom du mari de Madame C-4, et que le t\u00e9moin P-2 n'utilisait pas le bon nom pour identifier cette candidate. Enfin, il pr\u00e9cisa que, contrairement \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gu\u00e9 du paragraphe pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, cette dame, apr\u00e8s avoir subi un premier \u00e9chec du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur le 11 avril 2006, passa avec succ\u00e8s le deuxi\u00e8me examen le 12 avril de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.\n[116] Nous ne pouvons donner foi aux renseignements fournis par ce t\u00e9moin qui, en plus de fournir des dates et des renseignements inexacts, n'a pas eu une connaissance personnelle de l'incident alors que le t\u00e9moin M. \u00e9tait le mieux plac\u00e9 pour discuter du dossier de Madame C-2, puisqu'il l'avait \u00e9valu\u00e9e. De nouveau, il ne nous semble pas qu'il y ait eu irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 de la part de l'AEM dans ce cas.\n(iv) Cas de AM (homme de race blanche) [117] Le t\u00e9moin P-3 a racont\u00e9 au tribunal que Monsieur C-3 aurait \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises les tests pour la conduite du camion. Que le p\u00e8re de ce candidat se serait rendu dans la salle d'embauche de l'AEM pour crier sa frustration \u00e0 Monsieur G.C. et all\u00e9guer l'\u00e9chec de son fils \u00e0 l'examen de conduite du camion. Qu'il \u00e9tait mieux de le laisser passer. Que suite \u00e0 cette d\u00e9marche, Monsieur C-3 aurait r\u00e9ussi l'examen, d'ailleurs, il d\u00e9clare l'avoir vu lui-m\u00eame conduire le camion.\n[118] Le t\u00e9moin M. est venu d\u00e9clarer avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 Monsieur A.M pour la conduite du camion le 28 mars 2006 et qu'il avait r\u00e9ussi du premier coup.\n[119] Nous pr\u00e9f\u00e9rons donner foi au t\u00e9moin M., qui, en plus d'\u00eatre au courant du dossier, nous a sembl\u00e9 plus cr\u00e9dible.\n(v) Cas du fr\u00e8re d'une employ\u00e9e de bureau de l'AEM [120] Le t\u00e9moin M., afin de d\u00e9montrer l'absence de n\u00e9potisme \u00e0 l'AEM, est venu d\u00e9clarer avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 le fr\u00e8re de l'\u00e9pouse du candidat maghr\u00e9bin, celui qui avait eu droit \u00e0 une 3e reprise. Il ajouta que celui-ci \u00e9choua son examen, bien que sa sur \u00e9tait \u00e0 l'emploi de l'AEM.\n(vi) Cas de personnes qui ont subi des \u00e9checs [121] Le t\u00e9moin, M., en tant que directeur des relations de travail et la main d'uvre \u00e0 l'AEM, lorsque questionn\u00e9 sur le nombre de personnes qui auraient subi des \u00e9checs au cours des examens \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de pr\u00e9ciser qu'il n'y avait eu que quelques cas sur plusieurs centaines de candidats qu'il avait \u00e9valu\u00e9s.\n[122] Press\u00e9 de fournir des noms, il fut en mesure d'en fournir quelques-uns. Il pr\u00e9cisa que ce fut le cas :\nde Monsieur C-7 qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur \u00e0 deux reprises; s'agissait d'un individu de plus de 50 ans, non de minorit\u00e9 visible et qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 par le syndicat; de Monsieur C-5, qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test du camion \u00e0 deux reprises, qui avait entre 30 et 40 ans, non de minorit\u00e9 visible et croyait qu'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 par le syndicat; de madame C-6, qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test du camion \u00e0 deux reprises, qui avait environ 50 ans, non de minorit\u00e9 visible et \u00e9tait r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e par le syndicat; de Monsieur C-8, qui a \u00e9chou\u00e9 le test du camion \u00e0 deux reprises; s'agissait d'un individu de plus de 50 ans, non de minorit\u00e9 visible et n'\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9 par le syndicat.\n[123] Enfin, il pr\u00e9cisa que chacun de ces d\u00e9bardeurs a continu\u00e9 de travailler dans la deuxi\u00e8me r\u00e9serve m\u00eame apr\u00e8s son \u00e9chec.\nE. Document du Comit\u00e9 des listes [124] Suite \u00e0 ce que le t\u00e9moin P-1 est venu exposer devant le tribunal concernant un document qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 affich\u00e9 \u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e 2005, dont une partie traitait de l'\u00e2ge des futurs candidats au poste de d\u00e9bardeur, nous jugeons n\u00e9cessaire de pr\u00e9ciser notre position quant \u00e0 ce document.\n[125] Au cours de l'audience, Monsieur R., membre du Syndicat est venu pr\u00e9ciser qu'il s'agissait seulement d'un document de travail r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le Comit\u00e9 des listes du Syndicat. En aucun moment, ce document ne fut adopt\u00e9 par le Syndicat ni fit l'objet de discussions avec les repr\u00e9sentants de l'AEM.\n[126] Pour ces motifs, nous tenons \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que ce document ne fait pas partie des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve retenus pour rendre notre d\u00e9cision.\nVIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE [127] Notre analyse des nombreuses questions de fond \u00e9tant compl\u00e9t\u00e9e, nous sommes maintenant en mesure de nous pencher sur la question en litige.\n[128] Au d\u00e9but de l'audience, Me Deborah Mankovitz, apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e par le pr\u00e9sident du tribunal \u00e0 examiner attentivement la Question en litige qui appara\u00eet \u00e0 \u00e0 la page 6 de l'Expos\u00e9 de l'intim\u00e9e, telle que r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Me Daniel Leduc et \u00e0 la commenter, se d\u00e9clara d'accord avec sa formulation telle que reproduite ci-apr\u00e8s:\nLe plaignant a-t-il fait l'objet de discrimination en vertu de son \u00e2ge, sa situation de famille et\/ou son origine nationale ou ethnique par l'intim\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation de sa capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9tenir la classification d'op\u00e9rateur de camion, qui est une condition sine qua non \u00e0 l'accession \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien?\n[129] Compte tenu de la d\u00e9cision prise par Me Mankovitz, avant de faire son plaidoyer, de laisser tomber la partie de la plainte portant sur l'ethnicit\u00e9 et sur l'\u00e2ge , la nouvelle question en litige devient alors la suivante :\nLe plaignant a-t-il fait l'objet de discrimination en vertu de sa situation de famille par l'intim\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation de sa capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9tenir la classification d'op\u00e9rateur de camion, qui est une condition sine qua non \u00e0 l'accession \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien?\n[130] Le tribunal fait sienne la question en litige, telle que pos\u00e9e par les procureurs des deux parties.\nIX. PREUVE PRIMA FACIE [131] La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant, faisant abstraction de la preuve soumise par l'intim\u00e9e, est \u00e0 l'effet que les repr\u00e9sentants de l'AEM ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le plaignant avait \u00e9chou\u00e9 \u00e0 deux reprises l'examen du camion et qu'il n'avait pas le droit \u00e0 une troisi\u00e8me reprise.\n[132] Le plaignant est en d\u00e9saccord avec le r\u00e9sultat des deux examens et accuse l'intim\u00e9e d'avoir fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard sur la base de son absence de liens de famille avec le personnel de l'AEM.\n[133] Il est d'avis que le formateur ainsi que l'\u00e9valuateur ont tout fait pour saboter son \u00e9valuation.\n[134] Le plaignant ne peut accepter le fait qu'on a refus\u00e9 de lui donner droit \u00e0 plus de deux essais pour r\u00e9ussir l'examen de conduite du camion.\n[135] Il affirme que la r\u00e8gle de deux essais maximum est n\u00e9e le jour o\u00f9 il a subi son deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9chec.\n[136] Le plaignant ainsi que certains de ses t\u00e9moins racontent au tribunal que des d\u00e9bardeurs auraient eu droit \u00e0 plus de deux essais pour r\u00e9ussir l'examen du chariot \u00e9l\u00e9vateur et du camion.\n[137] Ils d\u00e9clarent que des liens de famille reliant certains de ces candidats \u00e0 des employ\u00e9s du bureau de l'AEM expliquent pourquoi ces candidats n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis aux m\u00eames r\u00e8gles que les autres, tel le plaignant.\n[138] Le plaignant ainsi que ses t\u00e9moins reconnaissent toutefois ne pas avoir eu une connaissance personnelle des faits qu'ils rapportent au tribunal. Ils avouent tenir ces renseignements de personnes avec qui elles auraient discut\u00e9.\n[139] Bien qu'une grande partie des renseignements fournis par le plaignant et par ses t\u00e9moins repose sur du ou\u00ef-dire , nous sommes d'avis que le plaignant a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 faire une preuve prima facie de discrimination.\nX. CONCLUSION [140] En ce qui a trait au premier examen pour la conduite du camion, qui eut lieu le 25 janvier 2006. Nous ne pouvons retenir les explications fournies par le plaignant. Nous retenons que le plaignant a heurt\u00e9 le conteneur avec son camion et refusons de croire que le bruit entendu a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par un outil utilis\u00e9 par le formateur. Nous n'acceptons pas l'id\u00e9e que le repr\u00e9sentant de l'AEM puisse avoir voulu saboter l'examen du plaignant. L'examen s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on normale et le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9.\n[141] En ce qui a trait au second examen, qui eut lieu le 26 janvier 2006, nous ne pouvons retenir la version du plaignant qui all\u00e8gue avoir subi un \u00e9chec \u00e0 cause du soleil pas plus que l'existence des freins d\u00e9fectueux du camion. Nous n'acceptons pas l'id\u00e9e que le repr\u00e9sentant de l'AEM puisse avoir voulu saboter l'examen du plaignant. L'examen s'est d\u00e9roul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on normale et le plaignant a \u00e9chou\u00e9.\n[142] En ce qui concerne la r\u00e8gle de deux essais maximum. Selon nous, la r\u00e8gle, bien que verbale, existait depuis au moins 1998. Elle est devenue \u00e9crite apr\u00e8s l'incident impliquant le plaignant mais pas \u00e0 cause de lui. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e \u00e0 tous les cas soumis \u00e0 notre \u00e9tude et non seulement au plaignant. Cette r\u00e8gle n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 aucunement appliqu\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire \u00e0 l'encontre du plaignant.\n[143] En ce qui concerne le n\u00e9potisme \u00e0 l'AEM. La preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant nous n'a pu d\u00e9montrer l'existence du n\u00e9potisme au sein de l'embauche par l'AEM. Nous n'avons pris connaissance d'aucun cas o\u00f9 un d\u00e9bardeur a pu obtenir la classification camion \u00e0 cause des liens de famille qui ont pu le lier \u00e0 des membres, dirigeants ou actionnaires de l'AEM.\n[144] Nous basant sur la preuve soumise, nous devons r\u00e9pondre par la n\u00e9gative \u00e0 la question en litige d\u00e9j\u00e0 pos\u00e9e, c'est-\u00e0-dire :\nLe plaignant a-t-il fait l'objet de discrimination en vertu de sa situation de famille par l'intim\u00e9e dans le cadre de l'\u00e9valuation de sa capacit\u00e9 de d\u00e9tenir la classification d'op\u00e9rateur de camion , qui est une condition sine qua non \u00e0 l'accession \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re r\u00e9serve de soutien?\n[145] Par cons\u00e9quent, nous rejetons la plainte de discrimination d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant.\nXI. QUEL EST LE REDRESSEMENT APPROPRI\u00c9? [146] Au cours de l'audience, le tribunal a inform\u00e9 les parties qu'advenant le cas o\u00f9 le plaignant aurait gain de cause dans sa plainte, il se r\u00e9servait le droit de recevoir \u00e9ventuellement toute preuve n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9valuer le redressement demand\u00e9.\n[147] Le tribunal ayant conclu que le plaignant n'a pu \u00e9tablir une preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l'encontre de l'intim\u00e9e, nous ne jugeons pas n\u00e9cessaire d'apporter \u00e0 ce stade quelque pr\u00e9cision que ce soit quant aux mesures de redressement.\nSign\u00e9 par R\u00e9jean B\u00e9langer\nOTTAWA (Ontario)\nLe 15 avril 2010\nPARTIES AU DOSSIER\nDOSSIER DU TRIBUNAL : T1365\/9508\nINTITUL\u00c9 DE LA CAUSE : Ramanan Thambiah c.

Conclusion\n[1] La plaignante Cathy Murphy a \u00e9t\u00e9 fonctionnaire f\u00e9d\u00e9rale de 1981 \u00e0 1994. L'autre plaignante, l'Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (AFPC), \u00e9tait son syndicat. En 2000, Mme Murphy, ainsi que de nombreux autres fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux qui \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s dans des groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine, a re\u00e7u des paiements du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada comme mesure de redressement pour deux plaintes de discrimination salariale que l'AFPC avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9es conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (LCDP).\n[2] Les paiements (commun\u00e9ment appel\u00e9s r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale) comprenaient une indemnit\u00e9 r\u00e9troactive concernant les revenus des employ\u00e9s \u00e0 partir de 1985. Ces paiements forfaitaires constituaient un revenu d'emploi aux fins de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de l'ann\u00e9e 2000, m\u00eame s'ils visaient un emploi qui avait eu lieu des ann\u00e9es auparavant. Le taux marginal d'imp\u00f4t de Mme Murphy a \u00e9t\u00e9 plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 en 2000 que pour les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, alors elle soutient qu'elle a en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 re\u00e7u moins d'argent que ce qu'elle aurait re\u00e7u si les paiements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 faits chacune de ces ann\u00e9es.\n[3] La Loi de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.) (LIR), comprend une s\u00e9rie de dispositions qui pr\u00e9voient un all\u00e9gement fiscal pour les personnes qui re\u00e7oivent des paiements forfaitaires portant sur un revenu gagn\u00e9 dans les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. L'intim\u00e9e, l'Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC), voit \u00e0 l'application des lois fiscales du Canada, y compris le m\u00e9canisme d'all\u00e9gement fiscal. Les plaignantes soutiennent que la fa\u00e7on dont l'ARC a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9, appliqu\u00e9 et administr\u00e9 ce syst\u00e8me, dans la [traduction] grande majorit\u00e9 des cas , a emp\u00each\u00e9 les prestataires de paiements de revenu r\u00e9troactifs portant sur la parit\u00e9 salariale, comme Mme Murphy, de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de l'all\u00e9gement fiscal.\n[4] Les plaignantes soutiennent que l'ARC a donc contrevenu \u00e0 l'article 5 de la LCDP en agissant de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire envers Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires du r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale sur le fondement du sexe, dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public. Les plaignantes soutiennent que l'ARC a aussi fait preuve de distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur le sexe en cours d'emploi envers Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP. Pour les motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision suivante, je conclus que la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nI. HISTORIQUE DE L'ORGANISATION DE L'ARC [5] La responsabilit\u00e9 de l'administration du syst\u00e8me fiscal du Canada a chang\u00e9 au cours des ann\u00e9es. Le minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Revenu Canada) a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9 en 1927 et s'est vu attribuer la responsabilit\u00e9 d'administrer les lois du Canada portant sur l'imp\u00f4t ainsi que sur les douanes et l'accise.\n[6] Le 1er novembre 1999, la Loi sur l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada, L.C. 1999, ch. 17, est entr\u00e9e en vigueur (SI\/99-111), transformant le minist\u00e8re en un organisme ind\u00e9pendant responsable du revenu national, appel\u00e9 l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada (ADRC). En d\u00e9cembre 2005, le nom de l'ADRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9 \u00e0 l'Agence du revenu du Canada, et la nouvelle Agence des services frontaliers du Canada est devenue responsable des op\u00e9rations de douane du Canada. Au long de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j'utiliserai g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement l'acronyme ARC pour faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l'intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame dans le cas d'\u00e9v\u00e9nements qui sont survenus avant le changement r\u00e9cent de nom.\nII. LES DOSSIERS D'\u00c9QUIT\u00c9 SALARIALE [7] Pendant la majorit\u00e9 de sa carri\u00e8re \u00e0 la fonction publique, Mme Murphy a \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9e \u00e0 Revenu Canada. Elle a occup\u00e9 des postes qui \u00e9taient principalement classifi\u00e9s dans le groupe professionnel CR (commis aux \u00e9critures et r\u00e8glements). L'AFPC \u00e9tait le syndicat du groupe d'employ\u00e9s CR. En 1984 et en 1990, l'AFPC, au nom des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux de six groupes professionnels, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en vertu de l'article 11 de la LCDP contre le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor du Canada (les plaintes en vertu de l'article 11). Dans les plaintes, il \u00e9tait all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les employ\u00e9s de ces six groupes professionnels \u00e9taient \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et qu'ils gagnaient des salaires moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux gagn\u00e9s par des fonctionnaires employ\u00e9s dans des groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine qui effectuaient du travail de valeur \u00e9gale.\n[8] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes en vertu de l'article 11 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) en octobre 1990, et les audiences ont d\u00e9but\u00e9 un an plus tard. En juillet 1998, les parties aux plaintes en vertu de l'article 11 savaient que le Tribunal allait bient\u00f4t rendre une d\u00e9cision. Les membres de l'AFPC avaient commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer des inqui\u00e9tudes \u00e0 leur syndicat au sujet des r\u00e9percussions fiscales de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. L'une de ces inqui\u00e9tudes portait sur la question de savoir si les paiements forfaitaires feraient augmenter la tranche d'imposition des prestataires pour l'ann\u00e9e lors de laquelle ils seraient pay\u00e9s. En pr\u00e9vision de cette possibilit\u00e9, des repr\u00e9sentants de l'AFPC, y compris l'agente \u00e0 la classification et au salaire \u00e9gal de l'AFPC Margaret Jaekl, ont rencontr\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants de Revenu Canada pour leur poser un certain nombre de questions, y compris quel serait le traitement fiscal des ajustements de parit\u00e9 salariale.\n[9] Revenu Canada a avis\u00e9 l'AFPC qu'en application du paragraphe 5(1) de la LIR, tout paiement forfaitaire de salaire doit \u00eatre enti\u00e8rement inclus dans les revenus de l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u. Aucune loi n'existait qui permettait l'imposition d'un paiement de salaire r\u00e9troactif dans les ann\u00e9es auxquelles il se rapportait ou l'imposition de ce paiement \u00e0 un taux sp\u00e9cial.\n[10] Le 29 juillet 1998, le Tribunal a conclu que les plaintes en vertu de l'article 11 \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es et il a \u00e9tabli une m\u00e9thodologie pour le calcul de l'\u00e9cart salarial entre les groupes professionnels \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance f\u00e9minine et ceux \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine, \u00e9cart qui \u00e9tait la source de discrimination (Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor) (1998), 32 C.H.R.R. D\/349). Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor d'effectuer des paiements r\u00e9troactifs d'ajustement de salaire aux fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux touch\u00e9s de 1985 jusqu'\u00e0 la date de la d\u00e9cision. Le Tribunal a aussi ordonn\u00e9 au Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor de payer de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat simple calcul\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on semestrielle au taux des obligations d'\u00e9pargne du Canada pour les ajustements des salaires.\n[11] Le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais la Cour a maintenu la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal le 19 octobre 1999 (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada [2000] 1 C.F. 146 (C.F. 1re inst.)).\n[12] Quelques jours apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 du jugement de la Cour, des repr\u00e9sentants de l'AFPC et du Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter dans l'espoir d'en arriver \u00e0 une entente pour toutes les questions laiss\u00e9es en suspens, y compris la d\u00e9termination des montants exacts de l'ajustement salarial. Le Tribunal n'avait pas directement trait\u00e9 cette question dans la d\u00e9cision de 1998, l'ayant plut\u00f4t d\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 une phase d'audience subs\u00e9quente portant le nom de Phase III. D'apr\u00e8s Mme Jaekl, qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la majorit\u00e9 de ces discussions, le Secr\u00e9tariat du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor s'est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re journ\u00e9e de r\u00e9union et a [traduction ] pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 les conditions [du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor] au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont les n\u00e9gociations se d\u00e9rouleraient. On a dit aux repr\u00e9sentants de l'AFPC que si ces conditions n'\u00e9taient pas accept\u00e9es, le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor mettrait fin aux discussions et porterait la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en appel. Ces conditions comprenaient l'\u00e9tablissement d'une entente au plus tard \u00e0 midi le troisi\u00e8me jour (un mercredi). De plus, les avocats des parties ne devaient pas participer aux discussions au sujet de l'entente.\n[13] Mme Jaekl a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien qu'elle n'\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 toutes les discussions entre les repr\u00e9sentants, \u00e0 sa connaissance, l'AFPC n'avait pas soulev\u00e9 la question des [traduction ] r\u00e9percussions fiscales pendant les rencontres. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que la priorit\u00e9 du syndicat \u00e9tait d'en arriver \u00e0 une entente sur l'application de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, qui soulevait \u00e0 elle seule de nombreuses questions, et qu'il n'y avait pas suffisamment de temps pour examiner des questions qui ne faisaient pas partie de la d\u00e9cision.\n[14] Les n\u00e9gociations ont port\u00e9 fruit et un protocole d'entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli et sign\u00e9 le 29 octobre 1999. L'article 13 du document \u00e9tait intitul\u00e9 Entente et pr\u00e9cisait que les parties conviennent que les dispositions de cette entente r\u00e8glent toutes les questions de la phase II et de la phase III des plaintes . Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, la phase III portait sur la d\u00e9termination du montant d'ajustement salarial.\n[15] Le 16 novembre 1999, l'avocat de l'AFPC, la Commission et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l'entente au Tribunal. Les membres du Tribunal ont pos\u00e9 des questions et ont demand\u00e9 des clarifications sur certaines parties de l'entente, puis le Tribunal a approuv\u00e9 l'entente et a rendu une ordonnance sur consentement (ordonnance sur consentement).\n[16] En 2000, les minist\u00e8res f\u00e9d\u00e9raux responsables des fonctionnaires actuels et des anciens fonctionnaires vis\u00e9s par l'ordonnance sur consentement ont appliqu\u00e9 les ajustements n\u00e9cessaires et ont effectu\u00e9 les paiements avec int\u00e9r\u00eat. Des ch\u00e8ques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mis en trois ou quatre versements entre avril et novembre 2000.\nIII. \u00c0 QUEL MOMENT ET DE QUELLE FA\u00c7ON LES DISPOSITIONS DE LA LIR EN QUESTION EN L'ESP\u00c9CE ONT-ELLES \u00c9T\u00c9 ADOPT\u00c9ES? [17] Le 16 f\u00e9vrier 1999, le ministre des Finances f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a annonc\u00e9 que dans le cadre du prochain budget f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, la LIR serait modifi\u00e9e afin d'ajouter une nouvelle approche au calcul de l'imp\u00f4t pour certains paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs. Cette proposition budg\u00e9taire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crite dans le Plan budg\u00e9taire, un document pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re des Finances que le ministre avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Parlement. Dans le cadre du syst\u00e8me d'imp\u00f4t progressif du Canada, les taux d'imposition augmentent en fonction de l'augmentation du revenu imposable. Le Plan budg\u00e9taire faisait remarquer qu'en raison de cette progressivit\u00e9, la dette fiscale d'une personne pour des paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que ce qu'elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si les paiements avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s, et impos\u00e9s, ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e alors que le revenu augmentait. Cette obligation fiscale plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e repr\u00e9sentait une augmentation de revenus pour le gouvernement.\n[18] Afin de garantir que le gouvernement ne tirerait pas un avantage indu de la progressivit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me d'imposition personnelle, le budget proposait l'application du m\u00e9canisme de paiement forfaitaire r\u00e9troactif admissible (PFRA). Un paiement forfaitaire r\u00e9troactif admissible serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme la portion principale (c'est-\u00e0-dire sans int\u00e9r\u00eat) d'un paiement re\u00e7u une ann\u00e9e, mais qui vise l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. Le m\u00e9canisme ne s'appliquerait que pour les paiements forfaitaires de 3 000 $ ou plus, provenant de certaines sources pr\u00e9cises, y compris le revenu d'emploi ou le revenu re\u00e7u en raison d'une cessation d'emploi, d'un jugement d'une cour, d'une d\u00e9cision arbitrale ou d'une transaction ayant mis fin \u00e0 une poursuite. Les paiements forfaitaires re\u00e7us par Mme Murphy en application de l'entente au sujet des plaintes en vertu de l'article 11 et de l'ordonnance sur consentement subs\u00e9quente portaient sur son emploi et d\u00e9passaient les 3 000 $. Par cons\u00e9quent, les paiements forfaitaires \u00e9taient admissibles aux fins du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA.\n[19] Donald Wilson \u00e9tait un conseiller en politiques au minist\u00e8re des Finances pendant la p\u00e9riode au cours de laquelle le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9. Il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00e9tabli au paragraphe 5(1) de la LIR, soit que le revenu est imposable dans l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u, avait toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 une source de pr\u00e9occupation pour beaucoup de contribuables, en particulier pour ceux qui avaient des revenus in\u00e9gaux , tels que les artistes. Ces personnes demandaient souvent un all\u00e9gement du traitement de leurs imp\u00f4ts.\n[20] Cependant, au cours de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l'annonce du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA dans le budget, le minist\u00e8re des Finances avait re\u00e7u de nombreuses demandes d'all\u00e9gement de membres de deux groupes d'employ\u00e9s pr\u00e9cis. Le premier groupe \u00e9tait constitu\u00e9 de 25 000 enseignants de l'Ontario qui recevaient des prestations de retraite qu'ils auraient d\u00fb recevoir dans les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Le deuxi\u00e8me groupe \u00e9tait compos\u00e9 de d\u00e9bardeurs du Qu\u00e9bec qui avaient obtenu des paiements r\u00e9troactifs de salaire en vertu d'une ordonnance de la cour. M. Wilson a reconnu que le minist\u00e8re des Finances savait aussi \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque que l'entente de parit\u00e9 salariale et les paiements forfaitaires qui en d\u00e9coulaient \u00e9taient [traduction ] en cours . Cependant, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA n'\u00e9tait pas con\u00e7u [traduction ] sur mesure \u00e0 l'avantage d'un groupe en particulier, mais qu'il avait simplement \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u apr\u00e8s un examen des donn\u00e9es particuli\u00e8res aux diff\u00e9rentes affaires qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9es \u00e0 l'attention du minist\u00e8re.\nIV. COMMENT LE M\u00c9CANISME DE PFRA DEVAIT-IL FONCTIONNER? [21] Comme il l'a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 dans le budget, le m\u00e9canisme pr\u00e9voyait un calcul sp\u00e9cial d'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique qui serait effectu\u00e9 en attribuant les paiements forfaitaires admissibles r\u00e9troactivement aux ann\u00e9es auxquelles ils se rapportaient et en calculant l'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique suppl\u00e9mentaire pour ces ann\u00e9es. Cependant, l'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique n'\u00e9tait pas seulement compos\u00e9 de l'imp\u00f4t qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pay\u00e9 au cours de ces ann\u00e9es. Il comprenait aussi un montant pour les int\u00e9r\u00eats qui refl\u00e9taient le retard dans le paiement des imp\u00f4ts pour les paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs. Le Plan budg\u00e9taire notait que les gouvernements encouraient des frais de financement lorsqu'ils recevaient des revenus d'imp\u00f4t plus tard que la date \u00e0 laquelle le paiement \u00e9tait d\u00fb.\n[22] La composante d'int\u00e9r\u00eat de l'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique devait \u00eatre calcul\u00e9e en fonction des taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat prescrits pour le remboursement d'imp\u00f4t, c'est-\u00e0-dire le taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat que le ministre paye lorsqu'il rembourse des imp\u00f4ts \u00e0 un contribuable. Depuis le 1er octobre 1989, le taux prescrit pour les remboursements en vertu de la LIR est calcul\u00e9 au taux des bons du Tr\u00e9sor de 90 jours plus 2 p. 100 (R\u00e8glement de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, C.R.C., ch. 945, art. 4301). Depuis le 1er janvier 1987, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est calcul\u00e9 quotidiennement de fa\u00e7on compos\u00e9e (article 164 et paragraphe 248(11) de la LIR).\n[23] Le 10 septembre 1999, l'\u00e9bauche de la loi modifiant la LIR, qui comprenait les dispositions portant sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au Parlement (projet de loi C-25). Les dispositions sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur le 29 juin 2000 (articles 110.2 et 120.31, dont le libell\u00e9 complet se trouve \u00e0 l'annexe 1 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision). Les dispositions en vigueur ne comprenaient aucune diff\u00e9rence importante par rapport \u00e0 la proposition dans le plan budg\u00e9taire de 1999. L'ARC avait cibl\u00e9 une erreur \u00e9vidente dans l'\u00e9bauche sur la fa\u00e7on dont le calcul serait effectu\u00e9, qui ne co\u00efncidait clairement pas avec la proposition du plan budg\u00e9taire. L'ARC a mentionn\u00e9 l'erreur au minist\u00e8re des Finances, qui a ensuite confirm\u00e9 que l'observation de l'ARC \u00e9tait juste. L'ARC a donc appliqu\u00e9 les dispositions de la fa\u00e7on correcte , m\u00eame si le Parlement n'a toujours pas modifi\u00e9 la disposition afin de corriger l'erreur.\n[24] Mme Jaekl a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que lorsque le budget a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois au Parlement en f\u00e9vrier 1999, elle a pris connaissance de l'existence du m\u00e9canisme propos\u00e9 de PFRA, mais elle ne s'est pas renseign\u00e9e \u00e0 ce sujet et n'a pas tent\u00e9 d'obtenir des d\u00e9tails. Par exp\u00e9rience, elle savait que le fait qu'un projet soit annonc\u00e9 au Parlement ne signifiait pas n\u00e9cessairement que le projet deviendrait loi. Cependant, elle a compris que si le m\u00e9canisme \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9, il pouvait \u00eatre avantageux pour les prestataires de r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale. Elle n'a obtenu une meilleure compr\u00e9hension du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA que lors d'une conf\u00e9rence \u00e0 laquelle elle a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 Halifax le 8 mars 2000, au cours de laquelle un des conf\u00e9renciers avait fourni une explication d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on dont le m\u00e9canisme fonctionnerait. Cette conf\u00e9rence a eu lieu plus de quatre mois apr\u00e8s que l'AFPC et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor aient n\u00e9goci\u00e9 l'entente pour les plaintes en vertu de l'article 11.\n[25] Aucune preuve ne m'a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e d\u00e9montrant que Mme Murphy ou un repr\u00e9sentant de l'AFPC avait communiqu\u00e9 avec l'ARC avant de signer l'entente de parit\u00e9 salariale en vue d'obtenir des d\u00e9tails au sujet du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, ni que quelqu'un avait communiqu\u00e9 avec le minist\u00e8re des Finances ou tout autre repr\u00e9sentant du gouvernement pour demander un changement \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont le m\u00e9canisme fonctionnerait.\nV. COMMENT L'ARC A-T-ELLE APPLIQU\u00c9 LE M\u00c9CANISME DE PFRA? [26] Depuis que les dispositions portant sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur, les contribuables qui ont re\u00e7u des paiements forfaitaires admissibles ont pu pr\u00e9senter une demande \u00e0 l'ARC afin de savoir s'ils pouvaient se pr\u00e9valoir de cet all\u00e9gement fiscal. Sheila Barnard est la gestionnaire de la section de la l\u00e9gislation de la Direction du traitement des d\u00e9clarations et des paiements des particuliers de l'ARC, qui est responsable de l'\u00e9tablissement des processus utilis\u00e9s pour le calcul de l'imp\u00f4t personnel. Elle a not\u00e9 que la disposition portant sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA permettait aux contribuables de d\u00e9clarer leurs paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactivement jusqu'\u00e0 1978. L'ARC a reconnu que peu de gens gardent leurs dossiers d'imp\u00f4t aussi longtemps et que l'Agence, quant \u00e0 elle, poss\u00e8de ces donn\u00e9es dans un syst\u00e8me informatique.\n[27] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'ARC \u00e9tait en mesure d'effectuer le calcul des PFRA pour les contribuables et d'\u00e9tablir un processus afin d'en arriver \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat. Elle a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un formulaire sp\u00e9cial (T1198), que les contribuables pouvaient annexer \u00e0 leur d\u00e9claration de revenus. Le formulaire est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement rempli par l'employeur. Si les contribuables font une d\u00e9claration de revenus par voie \u00e9lectronique, les donn\u00e9es du formulaire T1198 y sont inscrites. Le nom du prestataire de paiements forfaitaires appara\u00eet sur le formulaire T1198, ainsi que l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle le paiement forfaitaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u. Le montant est divis\u00e9 entre le principal et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Il y a ensuite une s\u00e9rie d'espaces vides, inscrits par ann\u00e9e \u00e0 partir de 1978 (la premi\u00e8re ann\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA s'applique) jusqu'\u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e actuelle d'imposition. Le montant du principal pour chaque ann\u00e9e est inscrit dans les espaces vides appropri\u00e9s. Pour le r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale des fonctionnaires f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, l'employeur a \u00e9mis un formulaire T1198 pour chacun des prestataires.\n[28] Mme Barnard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que d\u00e8s que l'ARC re\u00e7oit une d\u00e9claration de revenus \u00e0 laquelle un formulaire T1198 est annex\u00e9 ou une d\u00e9claration \u00e9quivalente produite par voie \u00e9lectronique, le syst\u00e8me d'\u00e9valuation effectue automatiquement un calcul normal de l'imp\u00f4t et un calcul sp\u00e9cial de l'imp\u00f4t en appliquant le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, \u00e0 condition que la partie du principal visant des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes soit d'un montant d'au moins 3 000 $.\n[29] Mme Barnard a expliqu\u00e9 que le calcul sp\u00e9cial de l'imp\u00f4t selon le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA est effectu\u00e9 comme suit :\nLe montant du paiement forfaitaire r\u00e9troactif admissible est d\u00e9duit dans le calcul du revenu imposable de l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle le paiement forfaitaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9 (l'ann\u00e9e courante). L'imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base est calcul\u00e9 pour le revenu imposable r\u00e9duit de l'ann\u00e9e courante, selon les taux d'imp\u00f4t et les cr\u00e9dits d'imp\u00f4t non remboursables applicables \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e courante. Un rajustement d'imp\u00f4t (qui s'ajoute \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base) est calcul\u00e9 en additionnant :\ntous les montants qui constituent une augmentation de l'imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base pour chaque ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, calcul\u00e9s comme si les portions vis\u00e9es du paiement forfaitaire avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ues dans l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle elles se rapportent, l'int\u00e9r\u00eat calcul\u00e9 sur l'augmentation de l'imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base pour chacune des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, selon le taux de remboursement prescrit, \u00e0 partir du 1er mai de l'ann\u00e9e suivant l'ann\u00e9e \u00e0 laquelle la partie du paiement forfaitaire est li\u00e9e jusqu'\u00e0 la fin de l'ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle le paiement forfaitaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7u.\nLe rajustement d'imp\u00f4t est ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base pour le revenu imposable r\u00e9duit de l'ann\u00e9e courante.\n[30] Lorsque l'ARC termine ce calcul, elle compare ensuite les r\u00e9sultats du calcul normal de l'imp\u00f4t (c'est-\u00e0-dire l'imposition du paiement forfaitaire en entier pour l'ann\u00e9e courante) avec le calcul sp\u00e9cial du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA afin de d\u00e9terminer quelle m\u00e9thode est la plus avantageuse pour le contribuable. Si le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA est plus avantageux, l'ARC l'utilise pour \u00e9tablir la cotisation de l'ann\u00e9e courante. Si le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA n'est pas avantageux, l'ARC \u00e9tablit la cotisation en fonction du calcul normal de l'imp\u00f4t. L'ARC produit ensuite un avis de cotisation ou un avis de nouvelle cotisation ainsi qu'une explication indiquant si le calcul de l'imp\u00f4t en fonction du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA \u00e9tait avantageux, suivi d'une lettre au contribuable expliquant le calcul et la comparaison en d\u00e9tail.\n[31] En des termes simples, l'exercice consiste \u00e0 recalculer l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de l'ann\u00e9e courante sans le paiement forfaitaire, puis d'ajouter \u00e0 cet imp\u00f4t le montant d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre pay\u00e9 si les montants du paiement forfaitaire avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s dans les ann\u00e9es auxquelles ils se rapportent. Si le paiement forfaitaire a plac\u00e9 le contribuable dans une tranche d'imposition plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans l'ann\u00e9e courante, alors logiquement, l'\u00e9tablissement de la cotisation \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard du contribuable en fonction du taux marginal d'imposition inf\u00e9rieur qu'il payait lors des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes entra\u00eenerait une r\u00e9duction de l'imp\u00f4t \u00e0 payer. Cependant, il faut tenir compte d'un autre facteur - l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui fait aussi partie du calcul. Lorsque l'int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9 est ajout\u00e9, l'effet probable est que tout avantage d\u00e9coulant du calcul de l'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu payable pour les paiements r\u00e9troactifs au taux marginal d'imposition inf\u00e9rieur est diminu\u00e9, \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents degr\u00e9s, par l'int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9 qui est inclus dans le calcul. Pour cette raison, les contribuables ayant re\u00e7u des paiements r\u00e9troactifs remontant \u00e0 six ans ou plus ne seront probablement pas avantag\u00e9s par le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA.\nVI. QUEL \u00c9TAIT L'EFFET DU CALCUL DU M\u00c9CANISME DE PFRA SUR LE TRAITEMENT DE L'IMP\u00d4T DE MME MURPHY? [32] Apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 la fonction publique en 1994, Mme Murphy est devenue une employ\u00e9e de l'AFPC. Au moment o\u00f9 elle a re\u00e7u ses paiements forfaitaires pour la parit\u00e9 salariale en 2000, son revenu avait augment\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on importante par rapport \u00e0 celui qu'elle gagnait lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait fonctionnaire. Sa tranche d'imposition \u00e9tait maintenant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e. Elle a re\u00e7u trois ch\u00e8ques en vertu de l'ordonnance sur consentement, deux ch\u00e8ques repr\u00e9sentant le principal de l'ajustement salarial (soit un total de 16 282,26 $) et un autre ch\u00e8que repr\u00e9sentant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat auquel elle avait droit, d'un montant de 9 266,03 $. Lorsque ces montants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 son revenu en 2000, son revenu total \u00e9tait de 93 452 $.\n[33] L'ARC a produit un avis de cotisation pour l'ann\u00e9e 2000 \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard de Mme Murphy le 18 avril 2001, dans lequel on l'avisait qu'elle \u00e9tait admissible au calcul de l'imp\u00f4t du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA. Le 25 avril 2001, l'ARC lui a envoy\u00e9 une lettre dans laquelle elle expliquait que ce calcul ne lui \u00e9tait pas avantageux. Le calcul normal de l'imp\u00f4t \u00e9tait plus avantageux, m\u00eame si son taux marginal d'imposition \u00e9tait maintenant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle travaillait pour la fonction publique. Le tableau accompagnant la lettre, qui expliquait le calcul, d\u00e9montrait que lorsque les montants du paiement forfaitaire de parit\u00e9 salariale (l'ajustement de revenu et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat) \u00e9taient inclus \u00e0 son revenu imposable pour l'an 2000, son imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base \u00e9tait de 15 433,23 $. Le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 un imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de base du montant de 18 494,65 $.\n[34] Par cons\u00e9quent, bien que le revenu de Mme Murphy soit maintenant plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, imposable en fonction d'un taux marginal d'imposition plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, elle ne pouvait pas profiter d'un all\u00e9gement fiscal en vertu du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA. Elle trouvait cela injuste. Si elle avait r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7u l'ajustement salarial dans les ann\u00e9es auxquelles il se rapportait, elle aurait pay\u00e9 de l'imp\u00f4t \u00e0 un taux marginal d'imposition moins \u00e9lev\u00e9. Elle \u00e9tait particuli\u00e8rement contrari\u00e9e par le fait que le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA comportait des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9tablis au taux du remboursement et que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9taient compos\u00e9s, surtout parce que l'ordonnance sur consentement n'avait pr\u00e9vu que le paiement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat simple. Elle \u00e9tait d'avis que dans cette situation, l'ARC calculait de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat sur les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s portant sur un revenu qu'elle n'avait jamais re\u00e7u.\n[35] Mme Murphy n'\u00e9tait pas la seule \u00e0 \u00eatre constern\u00e9e. De nombreux prestataires de paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale ont communiqu\u00e9 avec l'AFPC pour se plaindre du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA. Le 2 avril 2001, l'AFPC a publi\u00e9 un bulletin pour ses membres dans lequel elle indiquait qu'elle examinait la possibilit\u00e9 d'intenter une [traduction ] contestation \u00e0 cette pratique pour des motifs portant sur les droits de la personne . Le 21 juin 2001, le pr\u00e9sident de l'AFPC a \u00e9crit au ministre du Revenu national au sujet de ces questions, all\u00e9guant que la [ traduction ] pratique \u00e9tait [traduction ] discriminatoire . Le 12 juillet 2001, un haut repr\u00e9sentant du minist\u00e8re a r\u00e9pondu par une lettre, d\u00e9clarant que ces calculs font partie int\u00e9grante de la loi portant sur les paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs telle qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e par le Parlement, et qu'ils n'entra\u00eenaient pas toujours une r\u00e9duction de l'imp\u00f4t pour les prestataires de paiements forfaitaires. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l'ARC avait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 tous les efforts en 1999 et en 2000 pour s'assurer que les prestataires de paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale \u00e9taient avis\u00e9s que le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA ne fournirait pas n\u00e9cessairement un r\u00e9sultat avantageux. Les publications de l'ARC faisaient \u00e9tat qu'en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, plus les ann\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieures vis\u00e9es par le paiement r\u00e9troactif \u00e9taient \u00e9loign\u00e9es, moins l'\u00e9conomie fiscale \u00e9tait importante, si \u00e9conomie il y avait. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du calcul d'imp\u00f4t pour les paiements forfaitaires r\u00e9troactifs relevaient d'une politique en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t qui est la responsabilit\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re des Finances. L'ARC est simplement responsable de l'application de la loi.\n[36] Mme Murphy a communiqu\u00e9 avec Mme Jaekl et a exprim\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter sa situation comme fondement pour une cause type . Par cons\u00e9quent, le 11 mars 2002, l'AFPC et Mme Murphy ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Dans la plainte, elles soutenaient que l'ARC a recours \u00e0 la pratique discriminatoire suivante :\n[traduction]\n[...] l'imposition d'int\u00e9r\u00eats compos\u00e9s \u00e0 des taux \u00e9lev\u00e9s sur les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s d'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique, qui d\u00e9coulent de l'attribution d'un revenu re\u00e7u en vertu de l'ordonnance du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dat\u00e9e du 16 novembre 1999. Cette pratique discriminatoire est fond\u00e9e sur le sexe (f\u00e9minin) parce qu'elle emp\u00eache les personnes touch\u00e9es de recevoir un salaire \u00e9gal pour un travail de valeur \u00e9gale, comme l'exige l'article 11 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, en r\u00e9duisant la valeur r\u00e9elle des paiements ordonn\u00e9s, en violation de l'article 5 et de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces pratiques ont eu l'effet de r\u00e9duire les paiements effectu\u00e9s en application de l'article 11 de la Loi aux personnes touch\u00e9es, ce qui contrevient \u00e0 l'article 11 de la Loi.\n[37] Malgr\u00e9 la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans la plainte \u00e0 l'article 11, les plaignantes n'ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 devant le Tribunal que l'ARC avait viol\u00e9 cette disposition.\nVII. ANALYSE [38] Lorsqu'il s'agit de r\u00e9gler une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne, le plaignant doit d'abord \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qu'il y a eu discrimination (Comm. ont. des droits de la personne c. SimpsonsSears Ltd., [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, au paragraphe 28 (O'Malley)). Dans ce contexte, la preuve prima facie est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur du plaignant, en l'absence de r\u00e9plique de la partie intim\u00e9e. Si le plaignant \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il incombe alors \u00e0 la partie intim\u00e9e de r\u00e9futer les all\u00e9gations ou de prouver qu'il y a une explication raisonnable justifiant la pratique qui semble discriminatoire. Si l'intim\u00e9 fournit une explication raisonnable, il incombe au plaignant de d\u00e9montrer que cette explication n'est qu'un pr\u00e9texte \u00e0 la discrimination.\n[39] Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire que la discrimination soit le seul motif derri\u00e8re le comportement en question pour que la plainte soit justifi\u00e9e. Il suffit que la discrimination soit l'un des facteurs qui aient compt\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision ou l'action contest\u00e9e (Holden c. Compagnie nationale de chemins de fer (1991), 14 C.H.R.R. D\/12, au paragraphe 7 (C.A.F.); Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Uzoaba, [1995] 2 C.F. 569 (C.F. 1re inst.)).\nA. La pratique cens\u00e9ment discriminatoire d\u00e9coulant du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA a-t-elle eu lieu dans le cadre de la fourniture de services au sens de l'article 5? [40] Les plaignantes et la Commission soutiennent que l'ARC a agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public, au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP, qui se lit comme suit :\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d'installations ou de moyens d'h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d'en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l'occasion de leur fourniture.\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[41] Les plaignantes n'ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation ou preuve \u00e0 l'effet qu'on a [traduction] priv\u00e9 Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires du r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale d'un service. J'en conclus que l'all\u00e9gation de discrimination est fond\u00e9e sur l'alin\u00e9a 5b) -le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu \u00e0 l'occasion de la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public.\n[42] Qu'est-ce qu'un [traduction] service destin\u00e9 au public, en particulier en ce qui a trait aux activit\u00e9s d'organismes publics comme l'ARC? Les pratiques des agents du gouvernement dans l'ex\u00e9cution de leurs devoirs pr\u00e9vus par la loi sont-elles toutes des [traduction] services au sens de l'article 5, comme le Tribunal l'a laiss\u00e9 entendre dans la d\u00e9cision Bailey c. Ministre du Revenu national (1980), 1 C.H.R.R. D\/193, \u00e0 D\/214? La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, dans l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Watkin, 2008 CAF 170, a explicitement rejet\u00e9 cette opinion. La Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, aux paragraphes 31 et 32, que les actions du gouvernement dans l'ex\u00e9cution d'une fonction pr\u00e9vue par la Loi ne constituent pas tous des [traduction] services simplement parce qu'elles sont entreprises par la fonction publique pour le bien du public. Le terme services vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 5 s'entend de quelque chose d'avantageux qui est offert au public ou mis \u00e0 sa disposition .\n[43] Les plaignantes soutiennent que la d\u00e9cision de l'ARC \u00e0 savoir si un contribuable peut profiter de l'application des dispositions portant sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, en particulier compte tenu de l'objectif du Parlement d'augmenter l'\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de r\u00e9duire le fardeau fiscal des Canadiens par l'application des modifications au budget de 1999, vise \u00e0 fournir un avantage au public. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignantes soutiennent que l'ARC a fourni un service aux prestataires de parit\u00e9 salariale comme Mme Murphy.\n[44] Les plaignantes soutiennent que les d\u00e9marches de l'ARC au sujet des dispositions du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA sont [traduction] formul\u00e9es en termes d'actions \u00e0 l'avantage des contribuables. L'ARC a \u00e9labor\u00e9 un logiciel permettant d'effectuer les calculs pr\u00e9vus par ces dispositions. Les plaignantes ont not\u00e9 que dans au moins un des documents indiquant aux concepteurs de logiciels comment le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA fonctionne, les contribuables y sont appel\u00e9s [traduction] clients . L'ARC a effectu\u00e9 des tests pour v\u00e9rifier la justesse du logiciel lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9labor\u00e9. Elle a form\u00e9 ses employ\u00e9s qui traitaient les questions du public afin qu'ils avisent les contribuables de la fa\u00e7on dont le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA fonctionne. L'ARC a aussi \u00e9mis des bulletins de renseignements pour le public dans lesquels elle expliquait ce m\u00e9canisme.\n[45] Lorsque l'ARC re\u00e7oit les formulaires T1198 d'un contribuable, ses employ\u00e9s inscrivent les donn\u00e9es dans leur syst\u00e8me d'information. L'ARC cible et \u00e9limine les demandeurs qui n'ont pas re\u00e7u un paiement forfaitaire admissible \u00e0 l'all\u00e9gement fiscal (p. ex. de moins de 3 000 $). Le syst\u00e8me informatique de l'ARC effectue les calculs pr\u00e9vus par la LIR et produit les r\u00e9sultats qui sont ensuite inscrits dans les tableaux et les lettres qui sont envoy\u00e9s aux contribuables afin de les aviser si l'utilisation du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA leur est plus avantageuse que le traitement r\u00e9gulier de leurs imp\u00f4ts en ce qui a trait aux paiements forfaitaires.\n[46] Les plaignantes soutiennent que les actions susmentionn\u00e9es de la part de l'ARC rel\u00e8vent de la d\u00e9finition de [traduction] services destin\u00e9s au public vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l'article 5. Elles font valoir que, bien que l'arr\u00eat Watkin ait rejet\u00e9 l'opinion exprim\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Bailey, selon laquelle toute activit\u00e9 du gouvernement est un service, la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n'a pas rejet\u00e9 la conclusion pr\u00e9cise dans la d\u00e9cision Bailey selon laquelle l'exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre du Revenu de refuser de nombreuses retenues d'imp\u00f4t constitue un service.\n[47] De plus, les plaignantes ont cit\u00e9 un autre passage de l'arr\u00eat Watkin, au paragraphe 28, dans lequel la Cour a donn\u00e9 des exemples d'actions du gouvernement qui pouvaient constituer un service vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 5 :\nLes pouvoirs publics peuvent fournir des services pour s'acquitter des fonctions que la loi leur confie. Ainsi,l'Agence des douanes et du revenu du Canada offre un service lorsqu'elle communique des d\u00e9cisions anticip\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu; Environnement Canada fournit un service lorsqu'elle publie des bulletins m\u00e9t\u00e9orologiques et des rapports sur l'\u00e9tat des routes; Sant\u00e9 Canada offre un service lorsqu'elle incite les Canadiens \u00e0 s'occuper activement de leur sant\u00e9 en s'adonnant davantage \u00e0 l'exercice physique et en s'alimentant mieux; Immigration Canada fournit un service lorsqu'elle informe les immigrants sur la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour devenir un r\u00e9sident canadien. Ceci \u00e9tant dit, ce ne sont pas toutes les interventions gouvernementales qui sont des services. Avant que la Cour puisse accorder une r\u00e9paration pour cause de discrimination dans la fourniture de services , il faut d\u00e9montrer que les actes pr\u00e9cis reproch\u00e9s constituent des services [...].\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l'original.]\n[48] Il n'est pas surprenant que les plaignantes ne voient aucune distinction r\u00e9elle entre la d\u00e9cision anticip\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu et l'\u00e9valuation du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA. Dans les deux cas, un contribuable demande \u00e0 l'ARC d'effectuer un calcul. Mme Barnard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que les d\u00e9cisions anticip\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu sont fournies aux contribuables \u00e0 un certain prix, pour les aider \u00e0 d\u00e9cider de la voie \u00e0 suivre compte tenu des cons\u00e9quences fiscales qui en d\u00e9couleraient. Une circulaire d'information publi\u00e9e par l'ARC pr\u00e9cise que les d\u00e9cisions anticip\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu sont fournies \u00e0 titre de [traduction] service administratif , mais qu'il n'existe aucune exigence l\u00e9gale quant \u00e0 leur production. Cependant, l'ARC a soutenu que, par opposition, l'\u00e9tablissement, en application de la LIR, des cotisations \u00e0 l'\u00e9gard des contribuables pour l'imp\u00f4t qu'ils doivent r\u00e9ellement en vertu de la LIR n'est pas un outil optionnel; il s'agit plut\u00f4t de l'application ultime de la LIR en vue du recouvrement de l'imp\u00f4t. L'ARC soutient qu'il existe par cons\u00e9quent une distinction entre le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA fourni par l'ARC et les d\u00e9cisions anticip\u00e9es en mati\u00e8re d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu.\n[49] Quant \u00e0 elle, la Commission souscrit \u00e0 l'argument selon lequel l'\u00e9tablissement de cotisations est un service. La Commission a not\u00e9 qu'un contribuable a l'obligation de se conformer \u00e0 la LIR et de payer tout imp\u00f4t qu'il puisse devoir. L'avantage que l'ARC fournit aux contribuables comme Mme Murphy lorsqu'elle effectue le calcul pr\u00e9vu par le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA et lorsqu'elle fournit les r\u00e9sultats au contribuable est que ce contribuable est ensuite en mesure de se conformer \u00e0 ses obligations en vertu de la LIR et de payer le montant appropri\u00e9 d'imp\u00f4t f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sur le revenu. Le fait d'aider les contribuables \u00e0 satisfaire \u00e0 leur devoir de payer de l'imp\u00f4t est le service que l'ARC fournit et met \u00e0 la disposition du public.\n[50] Cependant, \u00e0 mon avis, la question de savoir si le calcul en vertu des dispositions sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA ou m\u00eame l'\u00e9tablissement des cotisations d'imp\u00f4t constitue ou non un service n'est pas pertinente quant \u00e0 la question v\u00e9ritable portant sur l'article 5. M\u00eame si ces activit\u00e9s constituent r\u00e9ellement un service, elles ne sont pas la question en litige en l'esp\u00e8ce. Plut\u00f4t, ce sont les conditions de la LIR et de ses r\u00e8glements qui sont en question en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[51] En ce sens, les circonstances de l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce sont semblables \u00e0 celles de l'affaire Forward c. Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada, 2008 TCDP 5. Les plaignants dans cette affaire \u00e9taient deux fr\u00e8res am\u00e9ricains. Leur m\u00e8re est citoyenne canadienne et ils ont tent\u00e9 d'obtenir la citoyennet\u00e9 canadienne gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 de leur m\u00e8re. Leur demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada parce qu'\u00e0 l'\u00e9poque de leur naissance, ni l'un ni l'autre de leurs parents n'\u00e9taient citoyens canadiens. Ils \u00e9taient donc inadmissibles \u00e0 la citoyennet\u00e9 au sens des dispositions sur l'affiliation de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9, L.R.C., 1985, ch. C-29.\n[52] Dans l'affaire Forward, les plaignants ont soutenu que le rejet de leurs demandes de citoyennet\u00e9 constituait une distinction illicite dans la fourniture de services destin\u00e9s au public (alin\u00e9a 5b)). Dans leurs observations, ils ont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la question en litige n'\u00e9tait pas la citoyennet\u00e9 en tant que telle, mais plut\u00f4t le droit qu'a une personne demandant la citoyennet\u00e9 de voir sa demande examin\u00e9e et trait\u00e9e d'une fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire. Par cons\u00e9quent, l'examen des demandes de citoyennet\u00e9 \u00e9tait un service.\n[53] Aux paragraphes 27 et 38, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 cette interpr\u00e9tation, en notant que la preuve et les arguments de cette affaire ne visaient pas le comportement de repr\u00e9sentants minist\u00e9riels, l'exercice d'un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ou l'application de politiques et de pratiques minist\u00e9rielles. L'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avait comme seule origine le libell\u00e9 de la Loi sur la Citoyennet\u00e9. Le Tribunal a not\u00e9 qu'en examinant une demande de citoyennet\u00e9, les fonctionnaires appliquaient des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gaux explicites \u00e0 des faits incontest\u00e9s, ni plus, ni moins. Toute contestation du processus d'examen d'une demande constituait en fait une contestation de la Loi sur la Citoyennet\u00e9.\n[54] \u00c0 mon avis, ces conclusions sont aussi applicables \u00e0 l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce. M\u00eame si les t\u00e2ches entreprises par l'ARC lors du traitement de demandes pour l'application du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA constituent un service, elles ne sont pas le fondement de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte. La pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a comme seule origine le libell\u00e9 des articles 100.2 et 120.31 de la LIR. Aucune des preuves qui m'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es n'\u00e9tablit le fait que la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e d\u00e9coule du comportement des responsables de l'ARC ou de l'application discr\u00e9tionnaire de politiques ou de pratiques de l'ARC. L'ARC applique la formule telle qu'\u00e9tablie dans la LIR en utilisant les renseignements fiscaux de chaque contribuable qui fait une demande. Pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment, des contribuables qui poss\u00e8dent leurs propres renseignements fiscaux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents pouvaient effectuer l'exercice math\u00e9matique par euxm\u00eames, sans l'intervention de l'ARC.\n[55] Rien ne donne \u00e0 penser que l'ARC n'a pas effectu\u00e9 les calculs en application du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA pour Mme Murphy conform\u00e9ment aux articles 110.2 et 120.31 de la LIR. Comme l'ARC poss\u00e8de d\u00e9j\u00e0 tous les renseignements fiscaux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents d'un contribuable, ainsi que les ressources technologiques pour effectuer efficacement le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, elle a entrepris ce travail. On pourrait faire valoir que l'ARC exerce un certain pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection pour l'application du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA en d\u00e9terminant si un paiement forfaitaire est admissible au sens des dispositions. Ce n'est pas la question en l'esp\u00e8ce, cependant. L'ARC a accept\u00e9 que les paiements forfaitaires de Mme Murphy et des autres prestataires \u00e9taient admissibles dans la mesure o\u00f9, bien entendu, les montants d\u00e9passaient les 3 000 $.\n[56] Les plaignantes ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l'ARC aurait pu, de fa\u00e7on discr\u00e9tionnaire, renoncer \u00e0 la portion de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA. Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA de la LIR, cependant, la portion d'int\u00e9r\u00eat est consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant de l'imp\u00f4t. Mme Barnard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'en vertu des dispositions d'\u00e9quit\u00e9 applicables, l'ARC ne peut renoncer qu'\u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, et non \u00e0 l'imp\u00f4t (paragraphe 220(3.1) de la LIR). L'ARC ne pouvait pas exercer de pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[57] En somme, la source de la pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n'est pas, en tout ou en partie, les activit\u00e9s de l'ARC, qu'il s'agisse d'un service destin\u00e9 au public ou non, mais plut\u00f4t exclusivement la loi elle-m\u00eame. Dans la d\u00e9cision Wignall c. Canada (Minist\u00e8re du Revenu national (Imp\u00f4t), 2003 CF 1280, au paragraphe 30, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a not\u00e9 que le comportement de Revenu Canada ne pouvait pas \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 de discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP, alors qu'il s'agissait plut\u00f4t de la contestation d'une disposition de la LIR.\n[58] Par cons\u00e9quent, si l'acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9, comme c'est le cas en esp\u00e8ce, d\u00e9coule seulement du libell\u00e9 de la LIR et non pas des activit\u00e9s de l'ARC, il ne d\u00e9coule pas de la fourniture de services de la part de l'ARC, au sens de l'article 5 de la LCDP. Par cons\u00e9quent, une preuve prima facie de discrimination au sens de cet article ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9tablie.\n[59] Cependant, si je me trompe et que la pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e constitue r\u00e9ellement un service au sens de l'article 5, je conclus tout de m\u00eame que les plaignantes n'ont pas \u00e9tabli une preuve de distinction illicite dans la fourniture de ce service, pour les motifs que j'\u00e9noncerai plus loin dans la d\u00e9cision.\nB. L'application du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA par l'ARC peut-elle \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en cours d'emploi au sens de l'alin\u00e9a 7b)? [60] L'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects, de d\u00e9favoriser un employ\u00e9 en cours d'emploi :\n7. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s'il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, par des moyens directs ou indirects :\n(...)\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser en cours d'emploi.\n7. It is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly,\n(...)\n(b) in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[61] Les plaignantes soutiennent que dans son application des dispositions portant sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, l'ARC a affect\u00e9 le r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale de Mme Murphy et des autres prestataires en diminuant leur revenu net par rapport au montant qu'ils auraient re\u00e7u si le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor s'\u00e9tait conform\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 11 de la LCDP d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part et leur avait pay\u00e9 un salaire \u00e9quitable. En d'autres mots, les actions de l'ARC ont eu l'effet de r\u00e9duire les portions de leurs salaires (le r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale) qui visaient autrement \u00e0 les indemniser. Les plaignantes soutiennent que cela constitue une forme indirecte de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel en cours d'emploi pour Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires, en contravention de l'alin\u00e9a 7b).\n[62] Bien que Mme Murphy ait travaill\u00e9 \u00e0 Revenu Canada pendant sa carri\u00e8re dans la fonction publique, sa plainte \u00e0 l'encontre de l'ARC ne d\u00e9coule pas de cette relation, mais d\u00e9coule plut\u00f4t de l'\u00e9valuation que l'ARC a faite de ses paiements forfaitaires en vertu de son r\u00f4le \u00e0 titre d'administrateur de la LIR.\n[63] Dans sa capacit\u00e9 d'administrateur du syst\u00e8me d'imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, peut-on conclure que l'ARC a d\u00e9favoris\u00e9 Mme Murphy en cours d'emploi ? Les plaignantes soutiennent que l'alin\u00e9a 7b) n'exige pas que l'intim\u00e9 soit l'employeur direct du plaignant. Elle fait valoir que la port\u00e9e de la disposition devrait \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on large, fondant cet argument sur l'arr\u00eat de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale Canadian Pacific Limited c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1991] 1 C.F. 571, dans lequel il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que dans le contexte de l'article 7, le terme emploi devrait se voir accorder un sens plus large que l'acception qui lui est attribu\u00e9e dans une relation ma\u00eetre-pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 .\n[64] Cependant, dans cette d\u00e9cision et dans d'autres d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es par les plaignantes dans leurs conclusions finales (Yukon (Human Rights Commission) c. Yukon (Human Rights Board of Adjudication), 2009 YKSC 44; Tulk c. Newfoundland (Ministry of Health and Community Services), [2002] N.J. no 65 (Nfld.S.C.T.D.)(QL)), bien que les intim\u00e9s n'\u00e9taient pas officiellement les employeurs des personnes qui avaient d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu qu'elles avaient [ traduction] utilis\u00e9 leurs services. Dans les d\u00e9cisions Canadian Pacific et Yukon, les plaignants \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s par des entrepreneurs qui avaient \u00e9tabli des ententes avec les intim\u00e9s pour la fourniture de services. Dans Tulk, le minist\u00e8re intim\u00e9 avait fourni du financement \u00e0 une personne pour qu'elle embauche le plaignant, mais le minist\u00e8re avait gard\u00e9 un certain contr\u00f4le sur la relation, y compris le droit de retenir le financement pour la r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration du fournisseur de services, ce qui aurait effectivement entra\u00een\u00e9 son renvoi.\n[65] L'\u00e9l\u00e9ment commun de toutes ces affaires est que les intim\u00e9s ont [traduction] utilis\u00e9 les services des plaignants, m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on indirecte. Cependant, \u00e0 titre de contribuables, Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires du r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale n'avaient pas une relation semblable avec l'ARC. En appliquant les dispositions au sujet du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA \u00e0 Mme Murphy et aux autres prestataires, l'ARC n'a pas utilis\u00e9 leurs services.\n[66] Les observations des plaignantes au sujet de l'article 7 ne tiennent pas compte des conclusions de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans une affaire qui, \u00e0 mon avis, est beaucoup plus pertinente et persuasive, l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bouvier, 1998 CanLII 7409 (C.A.F.). Les plaignants dans cette affaire \u00e9taient des personnes \u00e0 qui on avait refus\u00e9 un emploi de serrefreins\/agents de triage ou d'agents de train dans des compagnies ferroviaires parce qu'ils ne satisfaisaient pas aux normes d'acuit\u00e9 visuelle \u00e9tablies par les r\u00e8gles f\u00e9d\u00e9rales en mati\u00e8re de transport. Ils ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne contre le minist\u00e8re des Transports en all\u00e9guant, entre autres, que le minist\u00e8re avait indirectement refus\u00e9 de les embaucher, en contravention de l'article 7 de la LCDP. Ils ont soutenu que la notion d'utilisation des services d'un employ\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre \u00e9largie afin de comprendre le minist\u00e8re des Transports. Parmi les motifs cit\u00e9s \u00e0 l'appui de leur argument se trouvait le r\u00f4le que le minist\u00e8re des Transports joue dans l'adoption et l'application des r\u00e8glements qui \u00e9taient la source de la discrimination, ainsi que le statut quasi constitutionnel qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la Loi sur les droits de la personne.\n[67] La Cour a conclu, au paragraphe 4, que bien que ces arguments puissent sembler convaincants, les cours et les tribunaux n'avaient pas le pouvoir de reformuler la LCDP. L'article 7 ne pouvait pas \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 d'une fa\u00e7on qui aurait \u00e9tendu sa d\u00e9finition au minist\u00e8re des Transports, qui n'est pas responsable en dernier ressort de l'existence des r\u00e8glements et qui ne peut pas d\u00e9terminer leur effet juridique. La Cour a ensuite d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que un minist\u00e8re ne peut pas \u00eatre tenu responsable envers la Commission [des droits de la personne] d'une disposition discutable d'un r\u00e8glement pour la seule raison que le l\u00e9gislateur le charge d'appliquer la loi en vertu de laquelle ce r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement pris par le gouverneur en conseil . Je note en passant que cette derni\u00e8re citation de la Cour va dans le m\u00eame sens que le raisonnement des d\u00e9cisions Forward et Wignall, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es.\n[68] L'ARC n'utilise pas plus les services de Mme Murphy et des autres prestataires du r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale que le minist\u00e8re des Transports ne l'a fait pour les plaignants dans l'arr\u00eat Bouvier. La d\u00e9finition de l'article 7, de fa\u00e7on similaire, ne peut pas \u00eatre \u00e9largie pour inclure les actions de l'ARC en mati\u00e8re d'application de la LIR au revenu d'emploi re\u00e7u par les prestataires de parit\u00e9 salariale. Tout comme le minist\u00e8re des Transports, le r\u00f4le de l'ARC est d'appliquer une loi du Parlement (c'est-\u00e0-dire la LIR) et ses r\u00e8glements valablement pris. Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la conclusion de la Cour dans Bouvier, je ne vois pas comment l'article 7 peut \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[69] Les plaignantes ont cit\u00e9 une d\u00e9cision de la Colombie-Britannique dans laquelle il \u00e9tait conclu que le fait qu'une autorit\u00e9 charg\u00e9e de d\u00e9livrer les licences ait refus\u00e9 d'accorder des licences aux plaignants dans cette affaire pouvait engager sa responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu des dispositions portant sur l'emploi de la Loi sur les droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique (Mans c. British Columbia Council of Licensed Practical Nurses [1990] B.C.C.H.R.D. no 38 (B.C.C.H.R.)(QL), conf. pour d'autres motifs [1993] B.C.J. no 371 (B.C.C.A.)(QL)). La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e avec approbation par le British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision Bitonti c. College of Physicians & Surgeons of British Columbia, [1999] B.C.H.R.T.D. no 60 (B.C.H.R.T.)(QL)), bien que le tribunal ait finalement conclu, au paragraphe 84, que l'interpr\u00e9tation de la disposition propos\u00e9e par le plaignant dans cette affaire [traduction] \u00e9largirait la disposition beaucoup plus que ce que le l\u00e9gislateur aurait raisonnablement voulu. Comme la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale l'a mentionn\u00e9 dans Bouvier, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que bien que les lois en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on large et t\u00e9l\u00e9ologique, cela ne permet pas la [traduction] r\u00e9\u00e9criture des lois .\n[70] Mans est une d\u00e9cision d'un tribunal administratif qui porte sur une disposition l\u00e9gale diff\u00e9rente que l'article de la LCDP en question en l'esp\u00e8ce, sans mentionner qu'elle pr\u00e9c\u00e8de les conclusions dans l'arr\u00eat Bouvier, qui, \u00e0 mon avis, sont plus pertinentes. De fa\u00e7on plus importante, l'arr\u00eat Bouvier est une d\u00e9cision de la Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui, par cons\u00e9quent, lie le Tribunal. Je ne suis pas d'avis que la d\u00e9cision Mans soit une jurisprudence persuasive en l'esp\u00e8ce.\n[71] Pour ces motifs, je conclus que les all\u00e9gations des plaignantes en l'esp\u00e8ce, m\u00eame si elles \u00e9taient cr\u00e9dibles, ne peuvent pas engager la responsabilit\u00e9 de l'ARC en vertu de l'alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e9tation de la LIR. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucune preuve prima facie fond\u00e9e sur cet aspect de la plainte n'a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\nC. La preuve d\u00e9montre-t-elle que l'ARC a agit de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire fond\u00e9e sur le sexe envers Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires des paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale? [72] Comme je l'ai expliqu\u00e9 plut\u00f4t, lorsque les calculs du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9s pour la d\u00e9claration de revenus de Mme Murphy, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les dispositions portant sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA de la LIR ne lui offraient aucun all\u00e9gement fiscal. Il \u00e9tait plus avantageux pour elle d'utiliser le calcul normal d'imp\u00f4t pour l'ann\u00e9e 2000, malgr\u00e9 le fait qu'elle paierait de l'imp\u00f4t \u00e0 un taux marginal plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 que lorsqu'elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la fonction publique.\n[73] Elle n'\u00e9tait pas la seule parmi les prestataires de paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale pour qui c'\u00e9tait le cas. Mme Barnard a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le calcul du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA \u00e9tait plus avantageux pour seulement 7 % de tous les demandeurs pour l'exercice financier 2000, dont la grande majorit\u00e9 \u00e9tait des prestataires de parit\u00e9 salariale. Ces donn\u00e9es concordent avec la preuve selon laquelle il est peu probable qu'un calcul d'imp\u00f4t par le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA serait avantageux pour tout prestataire d'un paiement forfaitaire (d\u00e9coulant de la parit\u00e9 salariale ou pour toute autre raison) qui remonte \u00e0 plus de six ans. L'ordonnance sur consentement pr\u00e9voyait une indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire qui, selon la p\u00e9riode d'emploi du demandeur dans le poste affect\u00e9, pouvait s'\u00e9tendre bien au-del\u00e0 de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[74] Les plaignantes ont soutenu que Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires ont r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 oblig\u00e9s de payer de l'imp\u00f4t sur le paiement forfaitaire de parit\u00e9 salariale en fonction du calcul habituel de l'imp\u00f4t en 2000, \u00e0 des taux marginaux d'imposition \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, ils ont eu \u00e0 payer une plus grande partie de leur revenu en imp\u00f4t que les fonctionnaires qui travaillaient dans des postes \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine lors des ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es par les paiements forfaitaires.\n[75] Afin de d\u00e9montrer cette distinction illicite dont Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires de paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment victimes, les plaignantes ont produit la preuve d'expert de Gary S. Katz, un comptable agr\u00e9\u00e9 dont la pratique porte principalement sur des questions fiscales. Il a effectu\u00e9 une analyse des renseignements fiscaux et financiers de Mme Murphy et a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des sc\u00e9narios de ce qui serait arriv\u00e9 si Mme Murphy avait re\u00e7u le salaire additionnel au cours des ann\u00e9es auxquelles ils se rapportent, et a compar\u00e9 ces r\u00e9sultats avec le sc\u00e9nario actuel o\u00f9 elle a re\u00e7u les paiements forfaitaires en 2000.\n[76] Au fond, M. Katz a voulu d\u00e9terminer \u00e0 quel point Mme Murphy aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 avantag\u00e9e ou d\u00e9savantag\u00e9e si elle avait re\u00e7u les paiements au cours des ann\u00e9es auxquelles ils se rapportent, sans int\u00e9r\u00eat, plut\u00f4t qu'en un paiement forfaitaire auquel des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9taient appliqu\u00e9s en 2000, ce que, selon les plaignantes, l'ARC l'a oblig\u00e9e \u00e0 faire en d\u00e9clarant que les dispositions du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA ne lui \u00e9taient d'aucun avantage.\n[77] M. Katz a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport initial, qu'il a ensuite modifi\u00e9 dans un addenda, afin de tenir compte de certains commentaires de l'expert dans le domaine de l'imp\u00f4t que l'ARC a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner, la comptable agr\u00e9\u00e9e Martha Skeggs. M. Katz a examin\u00e9 cinq sc\u00e9narios possibles :\nMme Murphy aurait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des revenus additionnels au cours des ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 elle les a re\u00e7us; Mme Murphy aurait imm\u00e9diatement investi la totalit\u00e9 des revenus suppl\u00e9mentaires dans des bons du Tr\u00e9sor de six mois, ce qui, selon M. Katz, aurait refl\u00e9t\u00e9 ce qu'il percevait comme \u00e9tant le [traduction] profil de risque conservateur de Mme Murphy; Mme Murphy aurait investi seulement 15 % des revenus additionnels dans des bons du Tr\u00e9sor de six mois. Les 85 % restants auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement; Mme Murphy aurait imm\u00e9diatement investi la totalit\u00e9 des revenus additionnels dans un r\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d'\u00e9pargne-retraite (REER), en tenant compte des montants maximaux qu'elle pouvait investir au cours de ces ann\u00e9es (c'est-\u00e0-dire son [ traduction] droit de cotisation \u00e0 un REER ). L'instrument de placement utilis\u00e9 pour ce sc\u00e9nario \u00e9tait, une fois de plus, des bons du Tr\u00e9sor de six mois; Mme Murphy aurait investi seulement 15 % des revenus additionnels dans des bons du Tr\u00e9sor de six mois dans son REER. Les 85 % restants auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement.\n[78] Les trois premiers sc\u00e9narios ont \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9s avec la situation actuelle de Mme Murphy, c'est-\u00e0-dire que le principal et l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des paiements forfaitaires sont impos\u00e9s en 2000 en fonction du calcul d'imp\u00f4t normal. Le quatri\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario a \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9 \u00e0 une situation hypoth\u00e9tique, dans laquelle on supposait que Mme Murphy avait investi la totalit\u00e9 du principal et de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des paiements forfaitaires dans un REER. En fait, la preuve d\u00e9montre que Mme Murphy n'a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucune portion de son paiement forfaitaire dans un REER lorsqu'elle l'a re\u00e7u en 2000. Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, le cinqui\u00e8me sc\u00e9nario a \u00e9t\u00e9 compar\u00e9 \u00e0 la situation hypoth\u00e9tique dans laquelle 15 % du paiement forfaitaire de 2000 aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 investi dans un REER alors que le restant du montant aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pens\u00e9.\n[79] Selon le sc\u00e9nario no 1, dans lequel Mme Murphy aurait d\u00e9pens\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des revenus suppl\u00e9mentaires, M. Katz a conclu que Mme Murphy avait en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 tir\u00e9 avantage d'environ 10 % (1 507 $) du fait qu'elle avait re\u00e7u un paiement forfaitaire (y compris les int\u00e9r\u00eats) et que ce montant avait \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9 en 2000, par opposition au sc\u00e9nario o\u00f9 elle aurait re\u00e7u les revenus additionnels au cours des ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es.\n[80] Selon le sc\u00e9nario no 2, dans lequel Mme Murphy aurait \u00e9pargn\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des revenus additionnels au fur et \u00e0 mesure qu'elle les aurait gagn\u00e9s au cours des ann\u00e9es, M. Katz a conclu qu'elle aurait subi un d\u00e9savantage de 4 % (533 $) du fait qu'elle avait re\u00e7u un paiement forfaitaire.\n[81] Selon le sc\u00e9nario no 3, dans lequel elle \u00e9pargne seulement 15 % des revenus additionnels, M. Katz a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 qu'elle avait tir\u00e9 un avantage de 8 % (1 201 $) du fait qu'elle avait re\u00e7u des paiements forfaitaires.\n[82] Selon le sc\u00e9nario no 4, dans lequel Mme Murphy aurait investi tous les revenus additionnels dans son REER, en fonction de son droit de cotisation maximale \u00e0 un REER au cours des ann\u00e9es, M. Katz a conclu qu'elle avait subi un d\u00e9savantage de 77 % (12 043 $) du fait qu'elle avait re\u00e7u des paiements forfaitaires en 2000, par rapport \u00e0 l'hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle elle aurait investi le montant maximal admissible dans un REER en 2000.\n[83] Enfin, selon le sc\u00e9nario no 5, dans lequel seulement 15 % des revenus additionnels auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 investis dans des REER au cours des ann\u00e9es, M. Katz a conclu que Mme Murphy aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 financi\u00e8rement [ traduction] au pair , puisqu'il n'y avait eu aucun avantage ou d\u00e9savantage pour elle d\u00e9coulant du fait qu'elle a re\u00e7u des paiements forfaitaires en 2000.\n[84] Par cons\u00e9quent, seuls les sc\u00e9narios no 2 et no 4 de M. Katz pr\u00e9sentaient un d\u00e9savantage du fait que les paiements forfaitaires de Mme Murphy aient \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9s en 2000, au sujet desquels les plaignantes soutiennent que l'ARC est responsable parce qu'elle n'a pas permis \u00e0 Mme Murphy de profiter des dispositions du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA.\n[85] L'all\u00e9gation selon laquelle le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA aurait eu un impact n\u00e9gatif sur les finances de Mme Murphy, ou m\u00eame des autres prestataires de paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale, est loin d'\u00eatre une preuve convaincante et ne permet pas d'\u00e9tablir que ces cons\u00e9quences constituent une distinction illicite fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[86] N\u00e9anmoins, m\u00eame si j'acceptais que cette preuve \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie que Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires de parit\u00e9 salariale ont subi un impact financier n\u00e9gatif d\u00e9coulant de l'application du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA, bien que dans seulement deux des cinq sc\u00e9narios, je conclus que l'ARC a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 cette preuve de fa\u00e7on satisfaisante.\nD. Quelle est la preuve de l'ARC en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la preuve d'expert des plaignantes? [87] L'ARC soutient que les deux sc\u00e9narios (no 2 et no 4) dans lesquels M. Katz a relev\u00e9 un d\u00e9savantage sont [ traduction] suspects . Mme Skeggs a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'apr\u00e8s avoir analys\u00e9 le rapport de M. Katz, elle a conclu que les deux sc\u00e9narios ne m\u00e9ritaient que tr\u00e8s peu de poids, puisque ni l'un ni l'autre ne semblait r\u00e9aliste \u00e0 son avis.\n[88] Les deux sc\u00e9narios supposaient que Mme Murphy aurait \u00e9conomis\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des revenus additionnels (dans un REER ou non). Mme Skeggs et l'ARC ont not\u00e9 les probl\u00e8mes suivants au sujet de cette supposition :\nLes Canadiens \u00e9conomisent de moins en moins. Mme Skeggs a produit des renseignements d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de Statistique Canada indiquant que les taux d'\u00e9pargne ont diminu\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par le r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale (1985 \u00e0 1999). Au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980, le pourcentage d'\u00e9pargne personnelle par rapport au revenu disponible personnel \u00e9tait d'environ 15 %, mais au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1990, l'\u00e9pargne personnelle \u00e9tait d'environ 9 % et a chut\u00e9 \u00e0 environ 5 % en 2001. Par cons\u00e9quent, elle a conclu qu'un taux d'\u00e9pargne de 100 % est probablement irr\u00e9aliste. C'est en raison de sa preuve \u00e0 ce sujet que M. Katz a ajust\u00e9 son rapport initial et a inclus des sc\u00e9narios qui tenaient compte d'un taux d'\u00e9pargne de 15 % (les sc\u00e9narios no 3 et no 5). Il a conclu que Mme Murphy n'avait pas subi de d\u00e9savantage du fait qu'elle a re\u00e7u des paiements forfaitaires dans ces sc\u00e9narios.\nLes ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents r\u00e9els de Mme Murphy n'indiquent pas un taux important d'\u00e9pargne alors qu'elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la fonction publique. Mme Murphy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 des investissements ou un revenu d'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour seulement une des ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es (111 $ en 1990).\nAvant 1991, Mme Murphy n'avait contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 aucun REER alors qu'elle \u00e9tait employ\u00e9e \u00e0 la fonction publique. En tant que fonctionnaire, elle contribuait de 5 % \u00e0 6 % de son revenu au R\u00e9gime de pension agr\u00e9\u00e9 du gouvernement. Selon les donn\u00e9es de Statistique Canada pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Mme Skeggs, cette tendance de contribution correspondait aux contributions moyennes aux r\u00e9gimes de retraite et aux REER pour les femmes qui se trouvaient dans le m\u00eame quintile de revenu que Mme Murphy pendant cette p\u00e9riode. Par cons\u00e9quent, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable de supposer qu'elle n'aurait fait aucune autre contribution \u00e0 un REER. Ce n'est que lorsqu'elle a chang\u00e9 d'employeur et qu'elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 gagner un revenu beaucoup plus important que Mme Murphy a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 investir de fa\u00e7on plus importante dans ses REER, le plus pr\u00e8s possible du montant maximum auquel elle avait droit. Il serait d\u00e9raisonnable de supposer qu'elle aurait contribu\u00e9 100 % des revenus diff\u00e9rentiels \u00e0 un REER, ce qui n'aurait pas co\u00efncid\u00e9 avec ses tendances de contribution avant 1991. Il convient de noter qu'elle n'a contribu\u00e9 aucun montant de ses paiements forfaitaires \u00e0 son REER en 2000.\nLes montants additionnels de parit\u00e9 salariale, lorsqu'ils sont distribu\u00e9s au cours des 10 ann\u00e9es auxquelles ils se rapportent, sont relativement petits, certains sont aussi bas que 39 $ et 74 $ par ann\u00e9e. Cinq montants sont entre 1 107 $ et 1 781 $ (soit de 21 $ \u00e0 34 $ par semaine), et le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 est de 3 247 $ (pour l'ann\u00e9e 1989). Par cons\u00e9quent, m\u00eame le montant annuel le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 ne lui aurait rapport\u00e9 qu'un peu plus de 62 $ de plus par semaine. Avec de tels montants, il est peu probable qu'une personne \u00e9conomise la totalit\u00e9 des revenus additionnels de chaque ch\u00e8que de paye. Mme Murphy a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu'elle aurait [ traduction] peut-\u00eatre pu payer un peu plus pour rembourser son hypoth\u00e8que \u00e0 l'\u00e9poque, si elle avait re\u00e7u le revenu additionnel, malgr\u00e9 le fait que dans les ann\u00e9es 1980, \u00e9conomiser aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] difficile en raison des d\u00e9penses associ\u00e9es au fait qu'elle \u00e9levait ses enfants adolescents.\nL'analyse de M. Katz ne tenait pas compte de l'effet fiscal des contributions au REER. \u00c0 un certain moment, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 la retraite, les montants des REER sont retir\u00e9s, auquel moment ils sont impos\u00e9s comme un revenu. M. Katz a reconnu qu'il n'avait pas tenu compte de cet effet dans ses calculs. Le d\u00e9savantage relev\u00e9 dans son rapport au sujet du sc\u00e9nario no 4 serait donc grandement r\u00e9duit, en fonction du taux marginal d'imposition de Mme Murphy lorsqu'elle liquidera le REER. Mme Skeggs a calcul\u00e9 l'effet si Mme Murphy avait liquid\u00e9 son REER en 2000, au taux marginal le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans sa province (46 %). Les r\u00e9sultats ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que Mme Murphy aurait tir\u00e9 un avantage appr\u00e9ciable (de 22 %) en raison des paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale qu'elle a re\u00e7us en 2000. Bien que peu de personnes liquident leurs REER alors qu'ils re\u00e7oivent un salaire impos\u00e9 au taux marginal le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9, ce r\u00e9sultat donne \u00e0 penser que m\u00eame lorsqu'on tient compte de l'effet fiscal sur le REER au taux marginal le moins \u00e9lev\u00e9, les paiements forfaitaires causeraient un d\u00e9savantage beaucoup moins important, et pourraient m\u00eame entra\u00eener un avantage, que ce que M. Katz a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans sa preuve.\n[89] Ces arguments sont persuasifs. Il est fortement improbable que Mme Murphy ou tout autre Canadien dans sa situation au moment pertinent aurait \u00e9conomis\u00e9 la totalit\u00e9 des revenus additionnels diff\u00e9rentiels. Le d\u00e9faut de tenir compte de l'effet fiscal en ce qui a trait au sc\u00e9nario d'investissement de 100 % dans un REER soul\u00e8ve des doutes importants au sujet de toute autre conclusion de M. Katz aussi. Ni l'un ni l'autre des sc\u00e9narios cens\u00e9ment n\u00e9gatifs (no 2 et no 4) n'est r\u00e9aliste.\n[90] Les plaignantes soutiennent que l'affaire n'est pas seulement fond\u00e9e sur les renseignements financiers de Mme Murphy. Le rapport de M. Katz analysait la situation d'un autre fonctionnaire qui a re\u00e7u un paiement forfaitaire de parit\u00e9 salariale. Cependant, cette personne n'a pas t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des donn\u00e9es sur lesquelles le rapport est fond\u00e9. De plus, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Katz a \u00e0 peine touch\u00e9 aux sc\u00e9narios de cette personne. De plus, bien que M. Katz ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un addenda \u00e0 son rapport initial afin d'y apporter plusieurs corrections quant \u00e0 sa m\u00e9thodologie et \u00e0 ses calculs, ces ajustements n'ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s qu'au sujet de Mme Murphy. Il n'a pas appliqu\u00e9 les changements \u00e0 l'autre personne. Par cons\u00e9quent, les omissions et les erreurs dans le rapport initial qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9es dans l'addenda n'ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9es au sujet de l'autre personne. Ces conclusions ne sont donc pas fiables.\n[91] De plus, M. Katz a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que s'il avait ajust\u00e9 ses calculs pour l'autre personne comme il l'avait fait pour Mme Murphy, les [traduction] chiffres auraient [traduction] diminu\u00e9 , mais il \u00e9tait convaincu que ses conclusions seraient rest\u00e9es les m\u00eames au sujet du caract\u00e8re avantageux des paiements forfaitaires, de fa\u00e7on semblable \u00e0 ce qui est arriv\u00e9 pour les donn\u00e9es de Mme Murphy. Cependant, j'ai conclu que ces r\u00e9sultats au sujet des deux sc\u00e9narios des d\u00e9savantages que Mme Murphy aurait subis ne sont pas persuasifs et, par cons\u00e9quent, je ne suis pas convaincu, en particulier compte tenu de la preuve limit\u00e9e dont je suis saisi, que les r\u00e9sultats au sujet de l'autre personne auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 plus persuasifs.\n[92] Par cons\u00e9quent, il n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que Mme Murphy ou tout autre prestataire de parit\u00e9 salariale a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de distinction illicite du fait d'avoir re\u00e7u le r\u00e8glement sous la forme d'un paiement forfaitaire, et encore moins que cette pr\u00e9tendue distinction illicite \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur le sexe.\n[93] Mme Skeggs a expliqu\u00e9 une des raisons probables de ce d\u00e9roulement dans son t\u00e9moignage. Elle a not\u00e9 qu'en vertu de l'ordonnance sur consentement, tous les prestataires avaient droit \u00e0 l'int\u00e9r\u00eat pour les sommes qui leur \u00e9taient dues. Les taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9tablis par l'AFPC et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor (soit 90 % des taux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis au d\u00e9part dans la d\u00e9cision du tribunal - variant de 3,5 % (1998) jusqu'\u00e0 11,25 % (1985)) d\u00e9passaient de beaucoup le taux d'inflation pour la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode (qui \u00e9tait d'entre 1,65 % et 2,8 %).\n[94] Par cons\u00e9quent, comme c'\u00e9tait le cas dans le sc\u00e9nario no 1 (le sc\u00e9nario o\u00f9 le montant total \u00e9tait d\u00e9pens\u00e9), si on examine seulement le principal, sans l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, Mme Murphy aurait \u00e9videmment \u00e9t\u00e9 plus avantag\u00e9e par le paiement de ses revenus additionnels de fa\u00e7on diff\u00e9rentielle au cours des ann\u00e9es, alors que son revenu total \u00e9tait moindre et que, par cons\u00e9quent, elle payait de l'imp\u00f4t \u00e0 des taux marginaux moins \u00e9lev\u00e9s que ceux en 2000 alors que son revenu \u00e9tait beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. Le d\u00e9savantage aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 3 510 $ selon le taux de 2000 (c'est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de l'inflation). Cependant, le paiement forfaitaire comprenant les int\u00e9r\u00eats que Mme Murphy a re\u00e7u en 2000, apr\u00e8s imp\u00f4t, \u00e9tait de plus de 5 000 $. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat garantissait qu'il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable pour elle de recevoir son indemnit\u00e9 par paiement forfaitaire en 2000, plut\u00f4t que de l'avoir re\u00e7u par tranches au cours des ann\u00e9es.\n[95] La Commission et les plaignantes soutiennent que l'\u00e9tablissement de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat n'est pas pertinent quant aux questions en l'esp\u00e8ce. Il s'agit d'un redressement distinct et s\u00e9par\u00e9 dont on ne peut pas tenir compte dans l'examen \u00e0 savoir si l'\u00e9tablissement d'une cotisation \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[96] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette affirmation. La question, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l'analyse, est celle de d\u00e9terminer, avec l'aide de preuves d'experts, s'il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus avantageux pour Mme Murphy de recevoir son revenu par tranches au cours des ann\u00e9es ou s'il lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus avantageux de les recevoir par paiement forfaitaire en 2000. Afin d'effectuer correctement cette analyse, on ne peut pas \u00e9carter le fait que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 ses revenus lorsqu'elle les a re\u00e7us par paiements forfaitaires en 2000.\n[97] L'int\u00e9r\u00eat qui fait partie de l'entente entre l'AFPC et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor a \u00e9t\u00e9 calcul\u00e9 en fonction des taux des bons d'\u00e9pargne du Canada par le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision de 1998. Au paragraphe 477, le Tribunal a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un extrait de l'arr\u00eat Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Morgan, [1992] 2 C.F. 401 (C.A.F.), dans lequel la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat vise \u00e0 compenser les pertes . Si l'exercice auquel nous participons consiste \u00e0 \u00e9valuer si la plaignante a subi un d\u00e9savantage du fait qu'elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 indemnis\u00e9e sous forme de paiements forfaitaires, nous ne pouvons pas simplement ignorer la portion d'int\u00e9r\u00eats de cette indemnit\u00e9 que Mme Murphy a r\u00e9ellement re\u00e7ue, qui apr\u00e8s tout visait \u00e0 [ traduction] compenser les pertes entra\u00een\u00e9es par la discrimination salariale. Si ces pertes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 plus qu'enti\u00e8rement compens\u00e9es par les int\u00e9r\u00eats (dans le cas de Mme Murphy, il s'agit d'un exc\u00e8s de plus de 1 500 $), comment peut-elle soutenir qu'elle a subi un d\u00e9savantage? Cela n'a aucun sens.\n[98] De toute fa\u00e7on, cette question soul\u00e8ve une portion de l'affaire des plaignantes que j'ai de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 accepter. Elle porte sur le fait que les paiements forfaitaires, y compris l'int\u00e9r\u00eat, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Murphy et aux autres prestataires en raison d'une entente n\u00e9goci\u00e9e lors de la proc\u00e9dure des plaintes en vertu de l'article 11.\nE. La pr\u00e9sente plainte vise-t-elle \u00e0 \u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences normales et anticip\u00e9es de l'entente? [99] L'ARC a vigoureusement fait valoir que la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e9tait r\u00e9ellement une tentative de la part des plaignantes d'\u00e9viter les cons\u00e9quences normales et anticip\u00e9es de l'entente et de l'ordonnance sur consentement afin de discuter r\u00e9troactivement du traitement fiscal des paiements forfaitaires du r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re de parit\u00e9 salariale. Bien que je ne sois pas convaincu, comme l'ARC le soutient, qu'il s'agit ici d'un abus de proc\u00e9dure, je souscris \u00e0 la perception g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'ARC de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Compte tenu de mes conclusions pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes selon lesquelles la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e, mes commentaires \u00e0 ce sujet ne seront \u00e9tablis que sous la forme d'une observation.\n[100] Le 29 octobre 1999, l'AFPC et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor ont n\u00e9goci\u00e9 et sign\u00e9 un protocole d'entente dans le but d'appliquer la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne dat\u00e9e du 29 juillet 1998 . L'entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal le 16 novembre 1999. Le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 aux parties l'ordonnance sur consentement qu'elles demandaient, dans laquelle il \u00e9tait not\u00e9 que les parties avaient avis\u00e9 le Tribunal que les questions portant sur les diverses phases des proc\u00e9dures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solues gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 l'entente.\n[101] Comme l'ARC le mentionne, en tout temps, y compris lorsque l'entente a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9goci\u00e9e et sign\u00e9e, la LIR pr\u00e9voyait que les paiements forfaitaires comme ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pay\u00e9s en vertu de l'entente seraient impos\u00e9s dans l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us (paragraphe 5(1) de la LIR). Selon Mme Jaekl, l'AFPC est l'un des plus grands syndicats du Canada, qui a des bureaux dans tout le pays et qui embauche des avocats. Le syndicat a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 de nombreuses poursuites et ententes au sujet de l'emploi, de la parit\u00e9 salariale et des droits de la personne. Il a demand\u00e9 la v\u00e9rification de ces renseignements fiscaux aupr\u00e8s de Revenu Canada plus d'un an avant que la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal ne soit rendue, et il l'a obtenue. C'est cette r\u00e8gle fiscale qui a finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e aux paiements forfaitaires de Mme Murphy. Cette cons\u00e9quence fiscale n'\u00e9tait donc ni impr\u00e9vue, ni impr\u00e9visible.\n[102] Mme Jaekl a mentionn\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor avait mis beaucoup de pression sur l'AFPC pour en arriver \u00e0 une entente au courant de cette semaine de novembre 1999, apr\u00e8s que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ait rendu son jugement. Je ne suis pas certain si elle tentait de sugg\u00e9rer que l'AFPC avait \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de signer l'entente et qu'elle ne devrait donc pas \u00eatre li\u00e9e par les cons\u00e9quences de l'entente. Compte tenu du niveau de perfectionnement susmentionn\u00e9 de l'AFPC et du fait que ces n\u00e9gociations ont eu lieu apr\u00e8s un jugement de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale rendu en sa faveur, je suis d'avis que l'argument serait, \u00e0 tout le moins, douteux. De toute fa\u00e7on, l'endroit appropri\u00e9 pour soulever ce type d'observation aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 devant le tribunal qui a entendu les parties \u00e0 l'entente et qui a rendu l'ordonnance sur consentement, plut\u00f4t que devant le Tribunal qui entend la pr\u00e9sente plainte contre l'ARC.\n[103] Comme l'ARC l'a aussi mentionn\u00e9 dans ses observations, l'AFPC n'aurait pas d\u00fb \u00eatre surprise du fait que le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA avait des avantages limit\u00e9s pour ses membres. \u00c0 l'\u00e9poque de l'entente, la disposition sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 annonc\u00e9e dans le Plan budg\u00e9taire de f\u00e9vrier 1999 et avait fait l'objet d'un projet de loi devant le Parlement. La disposition qui est finalement entr\u00e9e en vigueur \u00e9tait identique en tout point \u00e0 ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 dans le Plan budg\u00e9taire de 1999, y compris le fait que l'imp\u00f4t th\u00e9orique calcul\u00e9 en vertu de la disposition comprend l'int\u00e9r\u00eat calcul\u00e9 au taux prescrit de remboursement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. Depuis 1989, la LIR pr\u00e9voit que la m\u00e9thode pour le calcul de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat est la capitalisation.\n[104] L'ARC note correctement qu'il est de pratique normale pour les parties de tenter d'att\u00e9nuer les r\u00e9percussions fiscales de redressements lorsqu'elles pr\u00e9sentent des observations sur le redressement devant le Tribunal. Par exemple, le Tribunal peut ordonner que les r\u00e9percussions fiscales sur le plaignant soient trait\u00e9es par une majoration du redressement (Green c. Canada (Commission de la fonction publique), 2003 TCDP 34, au paragraphe 7; Cashin c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, 1990 CanLII 650 (T.C.D.P.)). Les parties discutent souvent des r\u00e9percussions fiscales au cours de la m\u00e9diation et d'autres formes de discussion d'\u00e9ventuels r\u00e8glements, et souvent une r\u00e9solution au sujet de ces r\u00e9percussions fait partie des conditions du r\u00e8glement.\n[105] L'entente que l'AFPC a \u00e9tablie avec le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor mentionnait express\u00e9ment les r\u00e9percussions fiscales des montants de l'entente. La clause 12 stipulait que les parties avaient conjointement entrepris de pr\u00e9senter des renseignements en temps opportun aux employ\u00e9s au sujet des r\u00e9percussions fiscales li\u00e9es aux paiements forfaitaires.\n[106] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'ARC soutient que compte tenu du libell\u00e9 de l'entente, le fait que l'AFPC avait pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 et re\u00e7u des r\u00e9ponses de Revenu Canada au sujet des r\u00e9percussions fiscales des paiements forfaitaires, et compte tenu du niveau de perfectionnement de l'AFPC en tant que plaideur, il faut conclure qu'elle a accept\u00e9 le traitement fiscal des paiements forfaitaires qu'elle a n\u00e9goci\u00e9s. Soit la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et r\u00e9gl\u00e9e au cours de la n\u00e9gociation, soit l'AFPC aurait d\u00fb soulever la question.\n[107] Je suis d'accord. L'entente de r\u00e8glement entre l'AFPC et le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor r\u00e9solvait de fa\u00e7on compl\u00e8te et finale la plainte de parit\u00e9 salariale de prestataires. Comme il s'agit d'une entente, des n\u00e9gociations et des compromis ont d\u00fb avoir lieu. Mme Jaekl a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que bien que l'AFPC ait eu gain de cause devant le Tribunal et devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, elle avait int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre la question rapidement pour le bien de ses membres, en particulier puisque le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor avait mentionn\u00e9 son intention de porter la d\u00e9cision en appel si aucune entente n'\u00e9tait \u00e9tablie. N\u00e9anmoins, si l'AFPC croyait que le traitement fiscal des paiements forfaitaires aurait un impact n\u00e9gatif sur les prestataires de parit\u00e9 salariale, elle aurait pu refuser ces conditions ou n\u00e9gocier un autre type d'entente avec des cons\u00e9quences fiscales diff\u00e9rentes.\n[108] La Cour canadienne de l'imp\u00f4t a tir\u00e9 une conclusion semblable dans l'affaire Burrows c. La Reine, 2005 CCI 761. Dans cette affaire, la plaignante avait port\u00e9 en appel la cotisation d'imp\u00f4t sur la portion de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de ses paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale. Elle a soutenu que l'imposition de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat avant jugement \u00e9tait discriminatoire au sens de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s. La Cour a rejet\u00e9 sa demande pour d\u00e9faut de comp\u00e9tence, mais a ajout\u00e9, au paragraphe 47, que comme les deux parties \u00e0 l'entente de r\u00e8glement savaient que l'int\u00e9r\u00eat avant jugement est imposable en vertu de la LIR, elles pouvaient n\u00e9gocier un autre type de r\u00e8glement, tel que les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Puisqu'elle a consenti \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement comprenant des int\u00e9r\u00eats avant jugement, il faut consid\u00e9rer que l'AFPC a reconnu que ces int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e9taient imposables en vertu de la LIR.\n[109] Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, il faut consid\u00e9rer que l'AFPC a accept\u00e9 le fait que les paiements forfaitaires de parit\u00e9 salariale seraient impos\u00e9s dans l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us et que si le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA \u00e9tait finalement incorpor\u00e9 \u00e0 la LIR, la port\u00e9e de ses avantages serait limit\u00e9e.\nF. Le fondement de base de la plainte [110] Enfin, je souhaite traiter de ce qui, \u00e0 mon avis, est le fondement de base de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Les plaignantes ont soutenu que les conceptions d'\u00e9galit\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre incluses dans tous les contextes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et ne doivent pas \u00eatre limit\u00e9es \u00e0 des domaines pr\u00e9cis d'activit\u00e9, comme l'emploi. Elles soutiennent que comme le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA a entra\u00een\u00e9 le paiement d'un pourcentage plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de revenu en imp\u00f4t pour les prestataires de parit\u00e9 salariale, ces personnes ont souffert de discrimination. L'ARC avait l'obligation, d'apr\u00e8s les plaignantes, de prendre des mesures et de modifier l'effet de la disposition du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA en renon\u00e7ant ou en \u00e9tablissant \u00e0 la baisse le taux d'int\u00e9r\u00eat compos\u00e9 ou en prenant une autre mesure pour \u00e9liminer cette r\u00e9percussion.\n[111] J'ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que les impacts financiers n\u00e9gatifs all\u00e9gu\u00e9s du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA n'\u00e9taient pas fond\u00e9s. Cependant, m\u00eame s'il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli que Mme Murphy et les autres prestataires avaient subi un d\u00e9savantage, l'argument des plaignantes n'est pas justifi\u00e9. Il s'agit essentiellement du m\u00eame argument qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 dans l'affaire Sveinson c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2003 CAF 259, aux paragraphes 15 \u00e0 17. La plaignante dans cette affaire \u00e9tait aussi prestataire d'un paiement forfaitaire. Elle a soutenu que ce paiement forfaitaire aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre ajout\u00e9, pour les fins de l'assurance-emploi, \u00e0 son revenu pour les ann\u00e9es vis\u00e9es par le paiement, plut\u00f4t que pour l'ann\u00e9e au cours de laquelle le paiement forfaitaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. Les parall\u00e8les avec l'affaire en l'esp\u00e8ce sont \u00e9vidents.\n[112] La plaignante dans cette affaire soutenait que la disposition du R\u00e8glement sur l'assurance-emploi, DORS\/96-332, en question aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d'une fa\u00e7on qui s'\u00e9loignait du libell\u00e9 l\u00e9gal clair, parce que le d\u00e9faut de le faire minait le but de la LCDP, \u00e0 savoir, de mettre ceux qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 ill\u00e9galement sous-pay\u00e9s dans la m\u00eame situation financi\u00e8re que celle dans laquelle ils auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 si le gouvernement n'avait pas viol\u00e9 l'article 11 de la LCDP . La Cour d'appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que cet argument \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t un argument selon lequel une loi qui ne rectifie pas toutes les cons\u00e9quences indirectes d'une discrimination illicite par un employ\u00e9 serait elle-m\u00eame une violation de la LCDP. En rejetant cet argument, la Cour a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ce n'est pas ce genre d'incoh\u00e9rence qui fait en sorte qu'on doive rendre une l\u00e9gislation par ailleurs valide inop\u00e9rante .\n[113] Dans un m\u00eame ordre d'id\u00e9es, les plaignantes soutiennent que la disposition sur le m\u00e9canisme de PFRA de la LIR ne rectifie pas la cons\u00e9quence indirecte de l'imposition du salaire de Mme Murphy \u00e0 un taux marginal plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 parce qu'elle a re\u00e7u son salaire sous forme d'un paiement forfaitaire de parit\u00e9 salariale. Conform\u00e9ment au raisonnement de la Cour dans l'affaire Sveinson, cependant, je conclus aussi que le d\u00e9faut du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA de rectifier cette pr\u00e9tendue discrimination ne constitue pas le genre d'incoh\u00e9rence qui fait en sorte que l'ARC doive prendre des mesures afin de rendre la portion du calcul de PFRA sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat inop\u00e9rante .\nVIII. Conclusion [114] Pour tous ces motifs, j'estime que la plainte n'est pas fond\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par Athanasios D.
