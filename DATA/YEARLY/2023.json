The Tribunal found that the RCMP did not discriminate against Constable Desson.\nConstable Desson had a seizure. He was diagnosed with epilepsy. He started taking medications for his epilepsy. He did not have any more seizures. He did not think he was likely to have another seizure.\nAfter his seizure, the RCMP limited Constable Desson\u2019s work. He was not allowed to do frontline police work. He was only allowed to do desk work. The RCMP policy allowed Constable Desson to return to frontline police work after five years without a seizure.\nConstable Desson said this RCMP policy was discriminatory because it did not consider that he was very unlikely to have another seizure. He said he lost overtime work because of the policy. He also said he was not promoted because of the policy. The Tribunal agreed Constable Desson lost overtime work because of his epilepsy. The Tribunal did not agree he missed promotions because of his epilepsy.\nThe RCMP said it needed its epilepsy policy to keep police officers and the public safe. The Tribunal agreed. The policy reduces the risk of a police officer having a seizure in a dangerous situation. Medical evidence shows the risk is very small after five years. The RCMP policy is similar to policies for other jobs with similar safety risks. The RCMP fairly considered Constable Desson\u2019s medical history when it applied the policy. The RCMP tried to find Constable Desson meaningful desk work he could do until he could return to frontline policing.\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation: 2023 CHRT 1\nDate: January 10, 2023\nFile No.:\nT2276\/3118\nBetween:\nMichael Eric Desson\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police\nRespondent\nDecision\nMember:\nMarie Langlois\nTable of Contents\nI.

Decision\n[1] The Tribunal dismisses the complaint of discrimination on the basis of disability of Constable Michael Eric Desson (the Complainant). The Tribunal finds that while the evidence establishes that the Complainant was treated adversely because of his disability, the RCMP justified its discriminatory actions by establishing that the standard applied to the Complainant was a bona fide occupational requirement.\n[2] As for the Complainant\u2019s request for compensation in relation to the Respondent\u2019s alleged abusive or obstructive behaviour during the hearing, the Tribunal rejects it in the absence of a demonstration of abusive or obstructive behaviour on the part of the RCMP.\nII. Overview\n[3] Constable Desson was hired as a constable with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the Respondent) on January 28, 2008. He was posted to the Burnaby, British Columbia detachment as a constable where, after completing his training, he was able to work independently as of October 2008.\n[4] On July 14, 2010, on the way to work, he suffered an epileptic seizure while driving his personal vehicle, resulting in a traffic accident.\n[5] He was absent from work due to illness until his gradual return to work on November 6, 2010. At that time, he was relieved of his operational duties and assigned to administrative duties.\n[6] Pursuant to a policy of the Respondent (referred to as the 5 Year Policy), he can only return to operational duties five years after the last epileptic seizure, with or without taking epilepsy-related medication. In fact, he returned to operational duties just before the end of the five-year period, in May 2015, while continuing to take medication.\n[7] The period between November 2010 and May 2015 was punctuated by absences due to psychiatric illness which the Complainant assumed was related to his reaction to the 5 Year Policy preventing him from returning to operational duties prior to 2015. A subsequent period of psychiatric leave between 2017 and 2021 is also allegedly related to the Complainant\u2019s reaction to the 5 Year Policy, he argues.\n[8] The Complainant considers the 5 Year Policy to be prejudicial to him and discriminatory in that it applies to him without regard to his personal characteristics and his own specific risk of a recurrence of seizures.\n[9] He argues that the policy applies to any person who has had seizure episodes regardless of whether the seizure was caused by illness or by the use of certain stimulants, as he claims was the case here. According to him, having stopped taking these stimulants after the July 2010 seizure, he would have been able to resume his operational functions within a timeframe of six months, as was recommended by his physician Dr. John Diggle, a neurologist. Since he is required to take medication to control his condition for the rest of his life, he considers the original policy on this matter to be even more unfavourable to him, even though the revised policy was actually applied to him. We will come back to this.\n[10] The application of this policy also deprived him of training and career advancement opportunities, which allegedly had and is still having a significant financial impact.\n[11] The RCMP argues that the Complainant has not discharged his burden of proving prima facie discrimination. It questions the credibility and probative value of the Complainant\u2019s testimony. It contends that the Complainant suffered no adverse effect as a result of the employer\u2019s policy. The Respondent adds that the Complainant\u2019s timeframe for returning to work is attributable to his inability to acknowledge and admit his pathological condition of epilepsy and his fear of being judged unfavourably by his peers and superiors. The Respondent also argues that the Complainant has demonstrated his perceived bias of discriminatory conduct.\n[12] Alternatively, the Respondent argues that the employer\u2019s policy was applied to the Complainant in light of his particular circumstances and that it was justified by important safety considerations for the individual himself, his co-workers and the general public in light of the highly dangerous work of an RCMP officer who performs operational duties. In sum, in the RCMP\u2019s view, the 5 Year Policy is a bona fide occupational requirement under subsections 15(1) and 15(2) of the Act.\n[13] In addition, in his written submissions, the Complainant seeks costs for abusive and obstructive behaviour on the part of the RCMP because the Respondent failed to disclose certain documents until the hearing was already underway.\nIII. Issues\n[14] The issues are as follows:\nDoes the Complainant have one or more characteristics protected under the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 (the Act or CHRA)?\nIf so, did he experience an adverse impact with respect to his employment with the Respondent?\nIf so, were the protected characteristic or characteristics a factor in the Respondent\u2019s decision to with respect to removing the Complainant from operational duties?\nIf so, has the Respondent justified its decision under section 15 of the Act?\nIf not, what are the applicable remedies?\nHas the RCMP engaged in abusive and obstructive conduct by only disclosing some documents during the course of the hearing?\nIf so, is the Complainant entitled to financial compensation?\nIV. Legal Framework\n[15] The Complainant alleges that he was discriminated against in employment on the basis of disability contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Act.\n[16] Disability is one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination enumerated in section 3 of the Act. It is defined in section 25 as follows:\nDisability means any previous or existing mental or physical disability and includes disfigurement and previous or existing dependence on alcohol or a drug.\n[17] Paragraph 7(b) of the Act provides, among other things, that it is a discriminatory practice to differentiate adversely in the course of employment if the decision is based on a prohibited ground or grounds of discrimination under section 3 of the Act. Section 10 makes it a discriminatory practice to deprive an individual of employment or advancement opportunities if the decision is based on a prohibited ground of discrimination under section 3 of the Act.\n[18] Before addressing the issues in this case, it should be noted that the Complainant has the burden of showing that the practice to which he was subjected was, on its face, discriminatory (prima facie case). This proof is that which \u201ccovers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent\u2011employer\u201d (Ont. Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para 28 (\u201cSimpsons-Sears\u201d).\n[19] The case law recognizes the difficulty in proving allegations of discrimination by direct evidence given that discrimination is not a practice which one would expect to see displayed directly or overtly. The Tribunal\u2019s role, therefore, is to consider all the circumstances and to determine on a balance of probabilities whether there is discrimination or whether there is, as described in Basi (Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT)), the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d. In short, the Tribunal can draw an inference of prima facie discrimination when the evidence before it renders such an inference more probable than the other possible inferences or hypotheses (Beatrice Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada (Toronto: Carswell, 1987) at 142. See also Khiamal v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), 2009 FC 495 at para 60).\n[20] Thus, to discharge his burden, the Complainant has to show, on a balance of probabilities (Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Centre), 2015 SCC 39, at para 67 (\u201cBombardier\u201d), that he has a characteristic protected under the Act, that he experienced an adverse impact with respect to his employment and that the protected characteristic (referred to as a \u201cprohibited ground of discrimination\u201d by the Act) was a factor in the adverse impact (Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61 at para 33).\n[21] In making his case, the Complainant is not required to prove that the Respondent intended to discriminate against him, given that, as the Supreme Court of Canada noted in Bombardier, some discriminatory conduct involves multiple factors or is unconscious (Bombardier at paras 40, 41). Thus, the intent to discriminate should not be a governing factor. It is the result, namely the adverse effect, which is significant (Simpsons-Sears at paras 12, 14).\n[22] In addition, it is not essential that the connection between the prohibited ground of discrimination and the impugned decision be an exclusive one, or a causal one, given that it will suffice if the prohibited ground played a role in the decisions or conduct complained of. In short, the evidence must establish that the prohibited ground of discrimination was a factor in the impugned decision (Bombardier at paras 45-52).\n[23] Moreover, it is sufficient that the Complainant\u2019s disability was one factor in the Respondent\u2019s decision to remove him from operational duties for five years (A.B. v. Eazy Express Inc., 2014 CHRT 35 (CanLII) at para16).\n[24] If that is the case, once this proof of prima facie discrimination is established, the employer could justify its decision by showing, also on a balance of probabilities, that it flows from a bona fide operational requirement under section 15 of the Act. The burden of proof then shifts to the employer (Peel Law Association v Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396 (CanLII) at para 67).\n[25] Sections 15(1) and 15 (2) of the Act reads as follow:\n15 (1) It is not discriminatory practice if\n(a) any refusal, exclusion, expulsion, suspension, limitation, specification or preference in relation to any employment is established by an employer to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement.\n(b) (\u2026)\n(c) (\u2026)\n(d) (\u2026)\n(e) (\u2026)\n(f) (\u2026)\n(g) (\u2026)\n15 (2) For any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) to be considered to be based on a bona fide occupational requirement and for any practice mentioned in paragraph (1)(g) to be considered to have a bona fide justification, it must be established that accommodation of the needs of an individual or a class of individuals affected would impose undue hardship on the person who would have to accommodate those needs considering health, safety and cost.\n[26] The Supreme Court of Canada developed a three step test to determine whether there is a bona fide occupational requirement in the sense of sections 15(1) and 15(2) of the Act. The test is set out in Meiorin [British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3, para. 54 as follows:\n54 Having considered the various alternatives, I propose the following three-step test for determining whether a prima facie discriminatory standard is a BFOR. An employer may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the balance of probabilities:\n(1) that the employer adopted the standard for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job;\n(2) that the employer adopted the particular standard in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfilment of that legitimate work-related purpose; and\n(3) that the standard is reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of that legitimate work-related purpose. To show that the standard is reasonably necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is impossible to accommodate individual employees sharing the characteristics of the claimant without imposing undue hardship upon the employer.\n[27] As stated in Air Canada Pilots Association v Kelly, 2011 FC 120, para 356 to 358 (Kelly) :\n356 The first and second steps of the Meiorin test require an assessment of the legitimacy of the standard\u2019s general purpose, and the employer\u2019s intent in adopting it. This is to ensure that, when viewed both objectively and subjectively, the standard does not have a discriminatory foundation. The third element of the Meiorin test involves the determination of whether the standard is required to accomplish a legitimate purpose, and whether the employer can accommodate the complainant without suffering undue hardship: McGill University Health Centre v. Syndicate des employe-e-s de l\u2019Hopital general de Montreal, 2000 (SCFP-FTQ) 2007 SCC 4, 1 S.C.R 161, at para.14.\n357 As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in Hydro-Quebec v Syndicat des employe-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro-Quebec, section locale 2000 (SCFP \u2013FTQ), 2007 SCC 43, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 561, the use of the word \u201cimpossible\u201d in connection with the third element of the Meiorin test had led to a certain amount of confusion. The Court clarified that what is required is \u201cnot proof that it is impossible to integrate an employee who does not meet a standard, but proof of undue hardship, which can take as many forms as there are circumstances\u201d: at para.12.\n358 As to the scope of the duty to accommodate, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cThe employer does not have a duty to change working conditions in a fundamental way, but does have a duty, if it can do so without undue hardship, to arrange the employee\u2019s workplace or duties to enable the employee to do his or her work\u201d: Hydro Quebec, at para. 16.\u201d\n[28] Further, commenting on subsection 15(2) of the CHRA, the Federal Court in Kelly stated that it should be interpreted as limiting the factors to be taken into account in an accommodation analysis to health, safety and cost.\nV. Analysis\nA. Does the Complainant have one or more characteristics protected under the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 (the Act or CHRA)?\n[29] The Tribunal finds that there is no doubt that the Complainant has a disability within the meaning of section 3 of the Act.\n[30] Indeed, the evidence on file and the testimony of the Complainant and his attending physician, Dr. Diggle, allow us to conclude that over the years, since 2005, the Complainant has suffered several episodes of epileptic seizures (grand mal seizures).\n[31] In 2005, according to the notes from Dr. Diggle\u2019s first consultation with him on July 27, 2010, his then wife noticed \u201ca sudden onset, at night when the patient was sleeping, of stiffness of all 4 extremities, and then shaking, diffuse myalgia, petechial hemorrhage, and tongue biting\u201d.\n[32] At the hearing, Cst. Desson explained that in 2008, during a trip to Las Vegas for a friend\u2019s bachelor party, he had consumed a lot of alcohol and had stayed in the sun most of the day. The friend he was sharing the hotel room with told him that he saw him having generalized convulsions, described by Dr. Singh, neurologist , in his report from February 8, 2011.\n[33] Dr. Diggle indicates in his July 27, 2010 report that on May 8, 2010, another incident occurred when Cst. Desson was alone at his home. He felt \u201ca sudden onset of anxiety, went to look out the window, and then felt \u201cfixated\u201d developed \u201ctunnel vision\u201d. His left arm started shaking, he developed \u2018tunnel vision\u2019, and he woke up, at least one hour of time has passed. He had a cut above his right eye. He did seek medical attention for stitches, but no medication were started for seizure prophylaxis.\u201d\n[34] Then came the epileptic seizure on July 14, 2010, which caused the car accident.\n[35] The Tribunal\u2019s file also contains medical certificates from Dr. Fasihy, the treating physician, after July 14, 2010 with the diagnosis of \u201cseizures\u201d.\n[36] Paraclinical exams such as electroencephalography (EEG) were determined to be abnormal with demonstration of left anterior to mid-temporal spikes compatible with focal epilepsy. That is the diagnostic confirmed by Dr. Diggle. During the first consultation, on July 27, 2010 he wrote in his report:\nIMPRESSION\nFocal epilepsy, with pressured thoughts, anxiety as his aura. I suspect that the episodes of anxiety or focal seizures, and with secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures admixed. I suspect that they are arising from the left temporal region, given the spikes on his EEG. The main differential would be a focal epilepsy from the right hemisphere, given the left arm numbness, and it is possible to have bitemporal foci, though uncommon.\n[37] In light of this evidence, the Tribunal finds that the diagnosis of \u201cfocal epilepsy\u201d constitutes a disability within the meaning of section 3 of the Act and a prohibited ground of discrimination within the meaning of sections 7 and 10 of the Act. The Complainant therefore has a protected characteristic under the Act.\n[38] The answer to question A must therefore be in the affirmative. Cst. Desson has a disability under section 3 of the Act.\nB. If so, did he experience an adverse impact with respect to his employment?\n[39] The Tribunal is of the opinion that Cst. Desson suffered a detrimental effect in relation to his employment.\n[40] Indeed, after the epileptic seizure and the car accident of July 14, 2010, as soon as the Complainant was able to return to work in November 2010, the Respondent changed his status to non-operational. He was assigned administrative duties.\n[41] The Complainant testified that he could do very little or no overtime while doing administrative duties. Had he continued to perform his operational duties, his evidence is that he would have gained a substantial amount of overtime and experience that would have been very beneficial for his career advancement.\n[42] The evidence also demonstrates that his base salary did not depend on whether he was on full duties in category O2, on sick leave in the category O6 or on administrative duty in the O4 category (the category system will be explained later). During the whole period of medical leave between July 2010 and May 2015 when he was back on category O2, full operational duties, he maintained the same basic pay plus progression through pay scale increments.\n[43] His testimony is corroborated by his Notices of Assessment from the CRA and the pay stubs from the periods prior to and after May 2015. It is obvious that as soon as he was allowed to perform operational duties, he started to add overtime to his normal work week, sometimes as much as 20 or 25 hours extra per week, which substantially increased his remuneration.\n[44] That is sufficient to conclude that the Complainant suffered a financial prejudice. The Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to discuss the other prejudices that the complainant argued, for example the missed opportunities for promotion or the important psychological effect that the 5 Year Policy had on him.\n[45] The answer for question B is therefore yes, Cst. Desson suffered a detrimental effect.\n[46] The Tribunal also noticed that Cst. Desson testified of his perception of discrimination all through this period of 5 years. As examples, the cause of his motor vehicle accident on July 14, 2010, i.e. epilepsy seizure, was disclosed to his colleagues and that caused him anger and humiliation. He also mentioned that a colleague asked how his head was when he came back to work in November 2010. He perceived this as humiliating that people would know that he had had a seizure. For him, it was an embarrassing personal weakness.\n[47] He explained that at the police station in Burnaby, the constables who were part of the detachment but not present at the station because they were off duty sick on long term, or other reasons, had their pictures on a wall. He considered it to be the \u201cwall of shame\u201d and did not want to be part of it. During his testimony, he added that Sgt. Cathy Shepherd, the Career Development and Resource Advisor, during a meeting belittled him when she told him that she had lost her husband and got back to her feet, implying he should do the same. He felt again humiliated and discriminated against. He also recounted that being considered one of Sgt. Shepherd\u2019s seizure people was extremely disturbing.\n[48] These perceptions were certainly felt by Cst. Desson and he had the impression that they were discriminatory comments. But the Tribunal finds that these comments were more likely than not compassionate comments and a reasonable person would have perceived them as so. As for the \u201cwall of shame\u201d, Cst. Desson\u2019s perception might be the result of his own distorted view of colleagues that were absent from work. It is not useful at this point of the analysis to distinguish between the personal perceptions of the different people and how it affected Cst. Desson. This analysis might be relevant in the remedial stage assessing damages for pain and suffering.\nC. Were the protected characteristic or characteristics a factor in the Respondent\u2019s decision with respect to removing the Complainant from operational duties?\n[49] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the fact that Cst. Desson suffered epileptic seizures and has been diagnosed with Focal Epilepsy is the cause of the application of the 5 Year Policy that restrained him from operational duties for 5 years after his last epilepsy episode.\n[50] There can be no doubt, then, that the policy applied to the Complainant that removed him from his operational duties caused him significant financial harm, even though he maintained his base salary throughout the period in question. Indeed, he was not given the opportunity to work overtime and be compensated accordingly.\n[51] The complainant\u2019s disability is the reason why the Respondent removed him from operational duties, which caused a significant financial detriment to him. As such, there is a link between the disability and the adverse impact on the Complainant\u2019s job.\n[52] The answer to question C must therefore be in the affirmative, and the Complainant must be found to have made a prima facie case of discrimination on the balance of probabilities.\n[53] The question remains as to whether, as the RCMP contends, the decision to keep the Complainant out of operations between July 2010 and May 2015 constitutes a bona fide occupational requirement. This will be discussed in the next section.\nD. Did the Respondent justify its decision under section 15 of the Act by establishing that the standards applicable to Cst. Desson were a bona fide occupational requirement?\n[54] Although Cst. Desson\u2019s inability to perform operational duties is prima facie discriminatory, as determined in the previous section, it is not a discriminatory practice if RCMP establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the 5 Year Policy restricting him from operational duties is a bona fide requirement (BFOR) within the meaning of section 15(1) and 15(2) of the CHRA. In order to determine if the Respondent has met its burden of proof, the Tribunal has to answer the following questions:\nQuestion 1: Has the 5 Year Policy been adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job and is the policy reasonably necessary?\nQuestion 2: Has the 5 Year Policy been adopted in honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to fulfill that legitimate purpose?\nQuestion 3: Has the Complainant been accommodated to the point of undue hardship under the 5 Year Policy?\n[55] Before answering the first two questions, the Tribunal deems necessary to summarize the tasks of a General Duty Constable and the Medical Profile System with the grading of the Occupational limitations.\n(a) The tasks of a General Duty Constable\n[56] As a constable, Cst. Desson\u2019s tasks are described in the Integrated Task Bank for General Duty Constable outlined in a document called APP II-1-6 . They include the following:\na. Pursue fleeing suspect on foot or by appropriate vehicle (task 2.11);\nb. Apprehend\/restrain fleeing or resistant suspects, violent or deranged persons (chase, tackle or grapple with them, handcuff them, use deadly force and draw on physical ability, vision and hearing, training, knowledge of legal limitations in use of force as well as personal judgment to apprehend the suspect by using only as much force as necessary (task 2.12);\nc. Carry out enforcement patrols in problem areas (task 3.3);\nd. Respond to a call by radio, telephone or in person, requesting assistance for a sick, injured or drowning person (task 4.1);\ne. Respond to radio calls or citizens requesting assistance to locate a lost child, lost hunter, skier, hiker, confused or elderly person who wandered away from residence, or runaway youth (task 4.2);\nf. Respond to general requests for assistance made in person or received by radio, e.g. drive intoxicated persons home, rescue stranded motorists, drawing upon knowledge for community, personal discretion and positive concern in order to provide general assistance to the community (task 5.1);\ng. Enhance highway Safety by stopping or giving pursuit in a police vehicle (task 7.2);\nh. Act on one\u2019s initiative or on information from dispatch and undertake to stop a motor vehicle and the vehicle fails to stop (task 7.3) ;\ni. Pursue vehicle at speeds up to 240 km\/hour (task 7.4);\nj. If dispatch informs officer of warrant, suspension, or outstanding fine, approach driver\/occupant explaining the situation, arrest, towing if driver is suspended (task 7.7)\n(b) The Medical Profile System\n[57] The Medical Profile System of the employer is described in the documents as :\nThe medical profile system describes the member\u2019s occupational fitness or limitations in relation to his\/her ability to perform the tasks that define his\/her duties, in a manner that does not compromise the safety of coworkers, the public or the member.\n[58] Five aspects are evaluated : Visual capacity (V); Color Vision (CV); Hearing (H); Geographic availability of health care (G); and Occupational Restrictions (O).\n[59] The Occupational factor (O) describes a member\u2019s occupational capacity based on the tasks analysis for a General Duty Constable.\n[60] The grading for the Occupational Restrictions is described as follow:\n\u00b7 01: The member is capable of performing all the tasks of a general duty Cst. [Constable] defined in APP II-1-6 [Task Analysis for General Duty Constable] and is also capable of performing specific tasks beyond his level. (\u2026)\n\u00b7 02: (Recruit Minimum): This is the entry level for a Cst. An applicant or member must perform all the tasks of the general duty CsT outlined in App. II-1-6 in a manner that does not jeopardize his\/her safety, or that of coworkers and the public.\n1. An RM [Regular Member] who is 02 must be able to participate fully in an operational call out and must not suffer from any condition that carries an increased risk of sudden incapacitation.\n2. For a CM [Civil Member], O2 requires that the applicant or CM not suffer from any condition that might interfere with the ability to do the job for which he\/she is hired without compromising his\/her safety, that of coworkers or the public.\n\u00b7 03: This applies to a member or applicant for RM status who suffers from a condition that may interfere with the performance of policing duties but does not jeopardize safety\n1 The individual\u2019s limitations and restrictions must be clearly stated.\n2 The individual must not suffer from a condition that carries an increased risk of sudden incapacitation.\n3 The individual will be subject to operational call out where the defined occupational limitations and restrictions will apply.\n4 For a CM, the 03 profile describes an individual with a condition that affects ability to do the job for which he\/she is hired but does not prevent him\/her from doing the job and does not compromise safety.\n\u00b7 04: This applies to a member or applicant for RM status who suffers from a condition incompatible with the safe performance of police work as outlined in APP II-1-6\n1 The 04 factor will be assigned to an individual at increased risk of sudden incapacitation.\n2 This factor applies to an individual who suffers from a condition which may result in an occurrence that threatens his\/her safety or that of a coworker or the public. Limitations and restrictions must be clearly stated so that no such threat to safety occurs.\n3 An 04 individual is not subject to operational call out.\n4 This factor applies to a CM who suffers from a condition which prevents the safe performance of the tasks for which he\/she was engaged\n\u00b7 O5: This applies to an individual capable of performing only sedentary duties\n\u00b7 O6: This applies to an individual not considered employable by the RCMP in any capacity because of physical or mental condition.\n(c) The 5 Year Policy\n[61] The policy in litigation in the present case is the RCMP profile assignment for general constable who has been diagnosed as having epilepsy or who has had two or more seizures. The original 5 Year Policy states that this person will be assigned profile O4 i.e. non-operational. If the person requires medication to control the seizures, he will remain O4 for the rest of his career. If a person is off medication and seizure free for five years, profile O2 i.e. unrestricted duties may be appropriate. Therefore, according to the original written policy, a person like Cst. Desson who would require medication indefinitely (as we will see later) would have to stay on profile O4, i.e. non-operational duties, for the rest of his career.\n[62] According to the testimony of Dr. Ross, Dr. Johnson, Dr. Fieschi, and Dr. Beaulieu, that will be described in more details later, a change of that original policy was discussed in 2010 and finally applied to Cst. Desson. This change permitted him to return to operational duties within the 5 year period even if he was taking medication for his epilepsy condition indefinitely. The written policy has yet to be modified accordingly.\n[63] The complainant\u2019s focus and some of his actions may have been motivated by the written 1995 policy, but what applied to him was the revised policy i.e. the return to operational duties after 5 years even if the person is still taking medication.\n[64] As there was never a time when Cst. Desson was barred from operational duties under the original policy but would have been able to work under the revised policy, the Tribunal will therefore concentrate most of its analysis on the revised policy\nQuestion 1: Has the 5 Year Policy been adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job and is the 5 Year Policy reasonably necessary?\n[65] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the original and the revised 5 Year Policy has been adopted for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job. Further, the 5 Year Policy is reasonably necessary.\n[66] In order to analyse the question, the Tribunal took into consideration the general purpose of the 5 Year Policy, the legitimacy of the general purpose or, in other words, what is it designed to achieve? The Tribunal also considered whether there was any indication that these objectives could be accomplished some other means.\n(a) The Facts\n[67] The employer\u2019s 5 Year Policy is a specific Policy of maintaining a police officer on administrative duties for five years in the case of an individual with epilepsy. The applicable profile is the Profile App. II-1-5 that is specific to medical conditions of the Central nervous system. That is the profile that was applied to Cst. Desson. The rationale for the profile is explained in the document as follows:\nIn assigning the appropriate profiles for a neurological condition, it is necessary to determine whether the condition presents a safety risk to the member, coworkers or the public. If the condition may cause sudden incapacitation, assigning the factor is not difficult. The effect of uncontrolled affective disorders on judgment is obvious, as is the effect of paralysis. The effect of extreme cognitive impairment is apparent, but for mild impairment, the line between medical disability and performance inadequacy may be difficult.\nSome guidance in this area can be obtained from the Canadian Medical Association guide for driver examination, since driving is such an integral part of police work. Driving a police vehicle requires a class 4 license. This is not the only issue where public safety is threatened by sudden incapacitation but serves as a useful guide. A history of febrile convulsions limited to early childhood can be ignored, as can seizures attributable to a toxic illness from which the person has completely recovered. A person who has spontaneous seizures should undergo neurological investigation. If no epileptiform focus is found, the person must be seizure free, and on no drug for one year before returning to unrestricted duties. In the interim, the person will be assigned profile G2 to G4, O4.\nA person who has been diagnosed as having epilepsy or who had two or more seizures will be assigned profile O4. A person who requires medication to control seizures will remain O4. If a person is off medication and seizure free for five years, profile 02 may be appropriate. A person who has seizures only during sleep or immediately on waking for at least five years and who has at least two normal waking EEGs may be assigned profile O2 or O3. A person who has undergone surgery to prevent seizures must be seizure free and on no medication for at least five years before duty restrictions are removed.\nUnexplained and recurrent syncopal episodes are treated in a manner analogous to seizure disorders.\n(emphasis added)\n[68] The 5 Year Policy (profile App. II-1 5) specifies the relation to tasks for General- Diseases of the Central Nervous System as follow:\nDiseases of the central nervous system impact on police work in a number of ways: epilepsy carries a risk of sudden incapacitation; Alzheimer\u2019s \u2026\u2026\u2026 The impact of the disease on police work will depend on the results of the condition.\nFor the first Seizure Epileptiform Type:\nEpilepsy is impossible to detect if the epileptic event is not witnessed or the person denies the condition. Nevertheless, it is associated with sudden incapacitation. The occurrence of a seizure while pursuit driving or engaged in a task critical to the public safety could be disastrous and a person with an increased probability of such an occurrence must have duties restricted in a manner that will ensure public safety. Relevant tasks include: 2.11, 2,12, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 7.2, 7.4 and 7.7 [A description is at paragraph 56 of this decision]. It is important to consider not only the potential ill effects of a seizure while performing a task, but also the consequences of the person\u2019s sudden absence.\n[69] For the second Seizure-Epileptiform Type:\nOnce a person has had two spontaneous seizures, the person can be considered epileptic and must not be employed where sudden incapacitation can adversely impact public safety. If the seizure is due to some other pathology, then the permanence of the duty restrictions are determined by the curability and sequelae of the other pathology.\n[70] In summary, the reason expressed in the written policy is the safety risk to the member, coworkers and the public because of the risk of sudden incapacitation associated with the disorder. The 5 Year Policy is partly inspired from the Canadian Medical Association Guide for driver examination, since driving is such an integral part of police work.\n[71] The evidence also includes a document from the Canadian Council of Motor Transport Administrator (CCMTA) that includes the medical standards for drivers with different health conditions, notably seizures and epilepsy (Chapter 17).\n[72] The Complainant argues that the section of the CCMTA document on commercial driving, is not relevant as the RCMP does not require a commercial driver license (taxis, limousines, ambulances) (Class 4 in British Columbia) from their constables. It requires only a non-commercial driver license (Class 5 in British Columbia).\n[73] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the section on commercial driving of the CCMTA is highly relevant. Even if the RCMP does not require a Class 4 driver\u2019s license, the risk associated with the kind of driving a police officer does on a Code 3 appears closer to the risk or even higher than a commercial driver and more comparable to an ambulance driver. Indeed, the evidence shows that a police officer on a Code 3 driving task may have to pursue a fleeing suspect in a vehicle while in contact with the dispatch and trying to read a license plate or check for a criminal record meanwhile not losing the fleeing suspect for example. The pursuit is done at speeds up to 240 km\/hour. The cognitive demands of a pursuit while driving are very significant and certainly completely different from non-commercial driving. Therefore, the CCMTA guidelines for commercial drivers are relevant for the present case.\n[74] The Tribunal also accepted this evidence because of the reliability of the document. Indeed, the CCMTA is an organization comprising representatives of provincial, territorial and federal governments of Canada, which, through the collective consultative process, makes decisions on administration and operational matters dealing with licensing, registration and control of motor vehicle transportation and highway safety.\n[75] In Chapter 17, it explains seizure and epilepsy, its prevalence, the adverse driving outcomes, its effect on functional ability to drive, compensation and a guideline for assessment.\n[76] It states that:\nThe primary consideration for drivers with epilepsy is the potential for a seizure causing a sudden impairment of cognitive, motor or sensory functions, or a loss of consciousness while driving.\n(emphasis added)\n[77] It adds that:\nThe estimated risk of a recurrence after an initial unprovoked seizure ranges from 2.3% to 71% with an average risk recurrence for adults being 43%. If the cause of the seizure is unknown and the individual\u2019s EEG is normal, the risk of recurrence is reduced. Individuals who experience a partial seizure and have an abnormal EEG or other neurological abnormality, have an increased risk of seizure recurrence. A family history of epilepsy also increases the risk of recurrence.\n[78] The CCMTA adds that the general approach of the guideline for drivers with epilepsy or who experience seizures is that \u201cseizures must be controlled as a prerequisite for driving.\u201d Most of the guidelines include a requirement for a seizure-free period. The purpose of this requirement for an unprovoked seizure is \u201cto allow time to assess the cause, and where epilepsy is diagnosed, to establish the likelihood that a therapeutic drug level has been achieved and maintained, the drug being used will prevent further seizures, and there are no side effects that may affect the driver\u2019s ability to drive safely.\u201d (emphasis added)\n[79] For a commercial driver that has epilepsy, the CCMTA states that they are eligible for a licence if they have not had a seizure with or without medication for 5 years and the conditions for maintaining a licence are met (i.e. routinely follow treatment regime and the physician\u2019s advice regarding prevention of seizures and if they cease driving and report to the authority and physician if a seizure occurs).\n[80] For a non-commercial driver with epilepsy, eligibility for a licence is acquired 6 months after the seizure occurred with or without medication and if the conditions for maintaining a licence are met as for the commercial drivers.\n[81] If the medication changed, the commercial driver is eligible for a licence if it had been 6 months since the prescribed change or withdrawal and they have not had a seizure during this time and if the conditions for maintaining a licence are met. For the non-commercial drivers, in the same conditions, the period is 3 months.\n[82] Doctor Naomi Ross, occupied the function of Health Service Officer (HSO), occupational specialist, for the RCMP full-time at the pertinent time of the complaint. Her role was to assess member\u2019s fitness for duties, disability case management and regular health assessment for members of the British Columbia region. She testified at the hearing. She referred to an email sent on December 11, 2013 to Jeff Hurry the officer in charge of the Health Services of the RCMP and to Patti Parker, occupational health nurse, saying that the 5 Year Policy applicable to Cst. Desson was consistent with safety sensitive industry occupational guidelines for driving.\n[83] She specified that the RCMP 5 Year Policy was adopted in 1995 and she learned in December 2010, after talking to Dr. Beaulieu, neurologist specialized in epilepsy and National Health Advisor for the RCMP, that the policy was in the process of being reviewed and the restriction of being off medication before returning to operational duties was to be removed and replaced by \u201cbeing on or off medication\u201d. She added that the 5 Year Policy was aligned with the Canadian Medical Association Guidelines for Determining Fitness to Operate Vehicles (CMA), that were rather recent as they have been adopted in 2009. She added that the 5 Year Policy was also similar to the Canadian Railway Medical Rules Handbook and the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Law Enforcement Officers Guide (ACOEM).\n[84] She identified the risk of sudden incapacitation for a police officer and gave an example that the member can hurt himself, if he is alone in a confrontation with a violent offender, he can get hurt and his colleagues could be put in a situation where they would have to decide to look after their incapacitated colleague or attend the critical situation and protect the public. It could lead to catastrophic results.\n[85] Dr. Ross added that commercial driving is a high risk activity, the risk being similar to a police officer Code 3 driving (driving at high speed with the siren on) therefore the comparison with the CMA guidelines for determining fitness to operate vehicles is accurate.\n[86] Commenting on Doctor Diggle\u2019s report from July 27, 2010 on the seizure prophylaxis of a 98% chance to have a recurrence of seizure without medication considering that Cst. Desson had had 4 seizures in the past, she commented that RCMP tolerated a 1% risk of sudden incapacitation that comes after 5 years without any recurrence of seizures. The fact that Cst. Desson had an abnormal EEG confirming the diagnostic of epilepsy increased the risk of recurrence. She recommended that Cst. Desson was put on the O4 Profile (administrative duties).\n[87] Dr. Ross added that if an individual were operational and had to change his medication, then he would be restricted from operational duties for a period of 6 months following the change in medication. She added that it was the same rule from the CMA guides, the Canadian Railway Workers medical rules and the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine Law Enforcement Officers medical guides(ACOEM).\n[88] Doctor Krista Johnson, was also a Health Service Officer with the RCMP Health Service during the pertinent time of the complaint. She was in charge of Cst. Desson\u2019s case for a period of May 2011 to September 2012, after which, Dr. Ross again became the responsible HSO for his dossier. Her role amongst others would be to determine the fitness for work for police officers at the RCMP. At the hearing, she stated that the risk of seizure for a person suffering epilepsy was higher in the first 5 years after the seizure. She added that Cst. Desson had stopped taking his medication and the period of 5 years away from operational duties would restart thus the end of the 5 year period would now be on June 27, 2017. The discontinuance of the medication would have the effect that the period of 5 years would restart. She explained that the stop of medication worsened the risk of recurrence of seizures.\n[89] Doctor Isabelle Fieschi was, as Dr. Ross and Dr. Johnson, an HSO at RCMP. She was involved in Mr. Desson\u2019s case in 2014 and 2015. She testified that when determining an occupational status, the risk of an inadequate response to an emergency situation is taken into account. A seizure can cause a loss of consciousness and can be potentially very dangerous. The postictal confusion following the seizure and the impairment could impact the safe performance of the police officer\u2019s duty. She adds that data shows that the risk of recurrence gradually declines with time. After 5 years, the risk is reduced to an acceptable level, as it would be for a person who never had epilepsy. According to her understanding, the change of medication would be followed by a period of 6 months without operational duties. Contrary to Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony, she testified that it may prolong the clock, but does not restart it. Therefore, the period of 5 years would not restart after a change of medication. In fact, Cst. Desson\u2019s period of 5 years did not restart after he had stopped taking his medication for a period of time.\n[90] Dr. Marc-Andr\u00e9 Beaulieu is a neurologist with a subspecialty of epilepsy. At the relevant time of the complaint, he was the National Health Advisor for the RCMP. He testified at the hearing that the rationale for restricting the police officer who had 2 or more seizures from operational duties for a period of 5 years is the risk of sudden incapacitation and postictal confusion provoked by the disease and the fact that the police officer has a safety-critical job. He explains the danger of having a seizure while driving, especially for a police officer. In a pursuit or on Code 3 driving, a seizure could have dramatic effects. He adds that a police officer who would become incapacitated during a physical altercation with a suspect in the midst of doing an arrest could also be catastrophic for the officer and the public. Also, there is a serious safety consideration of carrying a firearm and being incapacitated. He adds that not only the incapacitation stage is critical, but the postictal stage when the person is totally confused could have very dramatic effect. He adds also that police officers need to be pretty sharp in what they do because they have major decisions to make in a very short time. They can be flight or fight-type decisions, critical decisions.\n[91] Dr. Beaulieu explained that the risk of sudden incapacitation diminishes with time if the individual does not suffer more seizures. After one year, for a person who had 2 or more seizures, the risk of having another one is 73%, after the third year, it drops to 8%, after the fourth it is 5% and the fifth year, it drops again to 3% and at the beginning of the sixth year, it is 2% or 1%. Therefore, after 5 years seizure free, for an individual who had not suffered another seizure, with or without medication, the risk of recurring seizures is reduced to an acceptable level of 2% to 1%. The original 5 Year Policy would permit an individual with epilepsy to go back to operational duties after 5 years without new seizures if he did not need medication. If medication was needed, the person would remain on administrative duties for the rest of their career. This aspect of the policy was changed in the course of 2010-2011 to allow a person who was taking medication to return to operational duties after 5 years.\n[92] Dr. Beaulieu explained that the RCMP adopted the 5 Year Policy and revised it after reviewing other policies. He added that the RCMP, being a policing organization, does not have the resources to redo the work that the main regulators do, so RCMP looked at other policies as best practices. It took into consideration the policy of the Canadian Medical Association and other safety-sensitive industry regulators, such as CCMTA which requires commercial drivers diagnosed with epilepsy to be seizure free for 5 years with or without medication before returning to commercial driving. He added that they also looked at other groups like the Canadian National Railway driving guidelines. Dr. Beaulieu also noted that other policing agencies, such as the Ontario Provincial Police, had a similar 5 Year Policy. He added that in other jurisdiction like Australia, United Kingdom, United States and Europe, the benchmark for returning to commercial driving was 10 years, some allowing drivers to be on or off medication while others required drivers to be off medication.\n[93] Dr. John Diggle is a neurologist with a subspecialty in epilepsy and the treating physician of Cst. Desson for the period of 2010 to 2016. He wrote in his July 27, 2010 report that Cst. Desson had 4 seizures in the past and he had a risk of recurrence seizure of 98%, therefore, he prescribed an anticonvulsive medication Tegretol.\n[94] He testified through an affidavit and cross-examination at the hearing. He explained the 98% risk of further seizures as follows:\nThis is based on well known aggregate data from medical literature which provides statistics on the rate of recurrent seizures in individuals with epilepsy diagnosis. Other neurologists aware of this medical data may conclude the risk as high as 100% or as low as 90%. The same medical data informed my conclusion that Mr. Desson had an 85% chance of achieving \u201cseizure freedom\u201d or no further seizure- by taking a single anticonvulsant medication indefinitely.\n[95] He added \u201cThe medical data has established that approximately 15% of patients like Cst. Desson with epilepsy will have a further seizure even when following a single medication\u201d. In the course of his cross-examination, he explained that this would be called a breakthrough seizure, i.e. a seizure that would happen as the patient is under medication care. Certain patients will need 2 different medications while some others will need a third medication and \u201ca small percentage of patients with epilepsy will not achieve seizure freedom in their lifetime, regardless of the medication regime they follow.\u201d\n[96] Dr. Diggle indicated that \u201cthe risk of recurrence cannot be individualized and is generalized for all patients who receive a diagnosis of epilepsy. Only the passage of time without a recurrent seizure will reveal how and when a patient achieves seizure freedom and whether, ultimately, that patient will fall into the category of 85% of patients on a single medication without further seizure or the category of 15% of patients who will experience further seizures\u201d. His perspective was mostly on a clinical level i.e. deciding if one or two or three medications were necessary to help avoid a recurrent seizure episode.\n[97] He explained:\nThe risk of seizure recurrence in patients with epilepsy like Mr. Desson is front-loaded. As time passes without a further seizure, the patient\u2019s risk of recurrence diminishes. At the time, given Mr. Desson\u2019s circumstances, medical profile and my knowledge of statistics in the medical literature, I would have considered the risk of Mr. Desson having a breakthrough seizure after 3-5 years seizure-free on medication as very small.\n[98] During his testimony, he explained the front-loaded risk of epilepsy, specifying that the risk of a recurrence is highest in the first six months. Then there is an exponential decline in somebody\u2019s lifetime risk that gets less and less and less over somebody\u2019s lifetime. So the longer that somebody is seizure free, the less likely they are to have a breakthrough seizure. On medication people have a very small risk of recurrence at three years and five years if they\u2019ve sustained seizure freedom over that time.\n[99] Dr. Diggle also explained that it is common for individuals with epilepsy to suffer from postictal confusion and disorientation shortly after suffering a seizure and may also suffer temporary cognitive defects for a period of time (hours or even days) such as poor attention, poor concentration, poor short-term memory and retrograde amnesia in relation to a period of time (hours or rarely up to a day or more).\n[100] Dr. Diggle did not comment on the 5 Year Policy, saying that he is not in a position to agree or support or negate or refute an internal guideline. He said that if it were an airplane pilot who has had a seizure, it would be for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to know what the specific risk tolerance is. It is the same thing with the RCMP Policy.\n[101] Cst. Desson admitted that as a police officer, a sudden incapacitation was a safety risk as amongst other things, there was a risk of being disarmed. He also explained that a Code 3 driving means to drive with the siren on, not obeying the rules of the road, driving over the speed limit, and at the same time, driving defensively and radioing the dispatch, reading the license plate, asking the dispatch for a criminal record, etc. At that time, the stress level of the police officer is quite high. It was his opinion that it is different and more risky than driving a commercial or private vehicle.\n[102] He also testified that he did some research on his own to discover that the Edmonton Police policy for officers that had seizure would be a restriction from operational duties for a period of 10 years seizure free and 5 years without medication. The Toronto Police would be 5 years with or without medication.\n(b) The Analysis\n[103] Firstly, the Tribunal is satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that the police officer\u2019s job is a safety sensitive job. The role of a police officer as described in the Integrated Task Bank for General Duty Constable is essentially to protect the public. As seen before, an officer could pursue, apprehend and restrain fleeing or resistant suspects, violent or deranged persons; carry out enforcement patrols in problem areas; give assistance for a sick, injured or drowning person; locate a lost, confused or runaway person; respond to general requests for assistance; enhance highway safety by stopping or giving pursuit and proceed to arrest a suspect.\n[104] These specific tasks demonstrate the very safety sensitive nature of a police officer\u2019s job.\n[105] Secondly, the Tribunal accepts, given the evidence, that the 5 Year policy is rationally connected to its goal of safety for the member, the co-workers and the public. Indeed, the risk of incapacitation and the postictal state after the seizure due to epilepsy is well demonstrated by the testimonies of two neurologists, specialized in epilepsy, Dr. Diggle and Dr. Beaulieu and by Dr. Ross, Dr. Johnson and Dr. Fieschi, HSO at RCMP. The CCMTA document, also explains the risk of sudden incapacitation due to epilepsy while driving, which is an important part of a police officer\u2019s job in the RCMP.\n[106] Even Mr. Desson admitted that sudden incapacitation, during for example a fight with a suspect, could be extremely dangerous for the member, his coworkers and the public.\n[107] The Tribunal considers probative the fact that, as established in the CCMTA document, seizures must be controlled as a prerequisite for restarting driving after a seizure. In order to achieve this goal, a seizure-free period is needed.\n[108] The duration of 5 years during which a police officer is restricted to administrative duties is also related to the performance of the job, as the risk diminishes with time and the absence of new seizures and the compliance of the patient to his doctor\u2019s advice on medication. For an epileptic, after a seizure, the evidence shows that the risk of a recurrence diminishes to 15% if the patient is compliant with his medication and goes down to 3% or 2% after 3 to 5 years or even to 1% after 5 years.\n[109] Doctors Ross, Johnson, Fieschi, Diggle and Beaulieu all share the same opinion on that subject, a 1% risk occurs after 5 years.\n[110] The RCMP has chosen to accept a risk of 1%. This decision is compatible with other jurisdictions that have adopted similar policies for the same purpose, some being even more restrictive and prolongating the period to 10 years.\n[111] This evidence supports that the 5 Year Policy is rationally connected to the safety sensitive nature of policing work.\n[112] The Tribunal adds that no contradictory evidence to suggest that the probability of a recurring seizure decreased to 1% before the 5 years mark. Moreover, there was no evidence that a 1% risk of reoccurrence was an unreasonably low threshold for the RCMP to adopt.\n[113] The Tribunal also considers that the 5 Year Policy is reasonably necessary for the performance of the job. The same evidence of safety risks demonstrates that the 5 Year Policy is rationally connected to the performance of the job also demonstrates that the 5 Year Policy is reasonably necessary to maintain appropriate safety standards for RCMP officers. The evidence demonstrates that an officer experiencing a seizure during their job would be a real risk to the officer, the public and their colleagues.\n[114] The 5 Year Policy only restricts operational duty when this risk is above a certain threshold, which is about 1%. The Tribunal accepts that the RCMP is entitled to choose a reasonable level of risk that it is willing to accept and that this level is reasonable given the potential for very significant consequences if a seizure occurs in many operational settings. The 5 Year Policy is specifically tailored to this risk by tailoring the restrictions to individual circumstances, as medical knowledge allows. It does this by limiting the 5 year restriction to individuals whose seizures do not have a trigger that indicates that they are unlikely to reoccur. Further, the 5 year restriction cannot be further tailored to an individual officer\u2019s risk as there was no evidence presented that an individual officer can be accurately assessed to determine if they have a lower risk of a recurrence.\n[115] Nonetheless, the evidence also demonstrates that the 5 Year Policy was applied flexibly to consider individual circumstances. Despite a lack of amendment to the original written policy, the medical experts applying the policy accepted that 5 years seizure free would be sufficient even if the officer was on medications to control seizures during that time. Further, as will be seen, Cst. Desson was ultimately individually assessed and allowed to return to full operational status slightly before 5 years had passed. As also seen in Dr. Fieschi\u2019s December 29, 2014 note commenting on the possibility of a return to full operational status after three years and from the February 13, 2014 HSO Panel review, the policy allowed the RCMP to consider the officer\u2019s individual medical circumstances rather than rely exclusively on the policy.\n[116] The 5 Year Policy is reasonably necessary because it is necessary to manage the severe safety risk of an officer becoming incapacitated from a seizure during operational work. It does this in a manner that accounts for an individual officer\u2019s circumstances and limits operational activities as little as possible given that it allows an individualized application of an officer\u2019s specific medical circumstances.\n[117] Thus, the Tribunal answers yes to the first question and concludes that the Respondent adopted the 5 Year Policy for a purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job and that the 5 Year Policy is reasonably necessary.\nQuestion 2: Has the 5 Year Policy been adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to fulfill that legitimate purpose?\n[118] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the 5 Year Policy has been adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to fulfill its legitimate purpose.\n[119] In order to answer this question, the Tribunal must consider whether the 5 year Policy was adopted by the RCMP for a discriminatory ulterior motive. This addresses the subjective element of the test.\n[120] As the Supreme Court of Canada has enunciated in Meiorin [para 60-61], even if the general purpose is rationally connected to the performance of the job as we saw in the previous section, here we have to verify if the reasoning has some connection with targeting epileptic persons, or even Cst. Desson himself, or other people with similar characteristics.\n[121] The original 5 Year Policy was adopted in 1995, a long time before Cst. Desson joined the RCMP and the revised policy was to Cst. Desson\u2019s advantage as it allowed him to come back to operative duties. Therefore, the Policy could not have been adopted to target Cst. Desson.\n[122] The 5 Year Policy is similar to many policies in a safety sensitive industries. Indeed, the evidence demonstrates that there is a broad consensus across similar industries that the risk of subsequent seizures is sufficiently serious that it requires managing. No evidence was provided of any reasons for these policies not related to the job.\n[123] The question is whether the RCMP adopted the standard in good faith. Here again, there can be no doubt that the RCMP satisfied the requirement. No one suggested that the RCMP had any motive for the standard it chose other than to maintain safety in the police force.\n[124] The complainant argues that Dr. Ross did not approve of the 5 Year Policy as she was of the opinion that he could return to operational duties in January 2011 with the exception of operational driving. According to his view, she demonstrated bad faith when she informed him that he had to be off of all operational duties for a period of 5 years.\n[125] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the reason for Dr. Ross\u2019s mistake was her lack of knowledge of the 5 Year Policy in 2010 and it does not constitute evidence of bad faith from the RCMP towards Cst. Desson. The Tribunal concludes that no evidence was provided to demonstrate that the original or the revised Policy was adopted in bad faith, in order to exclude people suffering from epilepsy, or Cst. Desson directly or arbitrarily from his operational job.\n[126] On the contrary, the evidence shows good faith and necessary to fulfill the legitimate security purpose. Indeed, the reasons for adopting the 5 Year Policy relates to the real risk of sudden incapacitation and postictal confusion that come from epilepsy for the reasons security of the member, the coworkers and the public.\n[127] The Tribunal concludes that the 5 Year Policy has been adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to fulfill the legitimate purpose to protect the safety of the member, his coworkers and the public. The Tribunal answer yes to the question 2.\nQuestion 3: Has the Complainant been accommodated to the point of undue hardship under the 5 Year Policy?\n[128] The Tribunal finds that the RCMP accommodated Cst. Desson to the point of undue hardship.\n[129] As mentioned before, the 5 Year Policy that applied to Cst. Desson was the revised 5 Year Policy allowing him to return to operational duties after 5 years without a seizure, even if he was taking medication indefinitely.\n[130] Between July 14, 2010 and May 6, 2015, Cst. Desson was put in in category O6, complete medical leave, and in the O4 category, when he was able to perform administrative tasks, as follow:\nJuly 14, 2010 to November 2010: category O6, complete medical leave;\nNovember 2010 to January 2011: category O4, administrative duties;\nJanuary 2011 to February 2013: category O6, complete medical leave;\nFebruary 2013 to May 2015: category O4, administrative duties;\nFrom May 6, 2015: category O2, all tasks including operational duties.\n[131] The complainant is of the opinion that when he was given administrative duties during the period of November 2010 and January 2011, he was not given any significant work that could help him in the development of his career. He believes that the respondent did not make sufficient efforts to support and accommodate him. He maintains that the Respondent applied the 5 Year Policy in a blanket fashion without taking into account his personal situation, the recommendation from Dr Fasihy and Dr Diggle, and the fact that his seizures were triggered by his use of ephedra, dieting, lack of sleep or overexercising.\n[132] He is also pleading that between January 2011 and February 2013, he was on complete medical leave because of a psychiatric condition that he attributes to being informed of the 5 Year Policy. He added that during that period, the RCMP should have put him back on operational duties, which would have reduced his medical absence due to a mental health situation.\nJuly 2010 to January 2011\n(a) The Facts\n[133] As seen earlier, on July 14, 2010, Cst. Desson had a seizure while driving his personal car to work. He was not wearing his uniform, but carried his service firearm, rounds of ammunition and handcuffs. He hit a cement rail and the car stopped without hitting anything else or hurting anybody. A bystander witnessed that accident and went to the vehicle to provide help. He noticed that Cst. Desson was shaking uncontrollably. An ambulance was called and Cst. Desson was brought to the hospital.\n[134] The ambulance report stated that the RCMP was on the scene and took the weapon and handcuffs from the complainant. It reported that the complainant was driving on the highway and had a minor motor vehicle accident due to a seizure. \u201cPt [patient] stated before getting on the Hwy [highway] he had an anxiety attack, L [left] hand had gone numb. Pt stated I should have pulled over\u201d. The diagnostic is identified as Seizure-Postictal [altered state of consciousness after an epileptic seizure].\n[135] Cst. Desson testified that on his way to the hospital he realized that he was going to be late for work and informed his college Justin Guiel by text message. When waiting at the emergency room at the hospital, Corporal Fluegal (Operations officer) and Corporal Stephane Hamel (District manager) showed up. He confided in Corporal Hamel, that he had had convulsions episodes in the past (a few months before when he was at home and also 5 years earlier and, at that time, his driving license was removed for 3 months).\n[136] The emergency room treatment assessment specified that Cst. Desson had no recollection of the seizure and post seizure, and he had postictal confusion. The seizure lasted approximately 20 minutes. The emergency room doctor urgently referred Cst. Desson to a neurologist. He wrote \u201cThank you for seeing this 39 years old male police officer urgently who has had 2 seizures in 2 months, once while driving.\u201d The doctor added that the CT scan of the head was normal. In fact the CT scan showed no acute intracranial abnormality. Cst. Desson was released from the hospital.\n[137] That night, he was informed that Sargent Rob Lemon disclosed to the night shift crew what had happened to him, i.e. the seizure and motor vehicle accident. Cst. Desson testified that he was super angry that this information was now known to his colleagues. He was embarrassed for having had a seizure that had caused an accident. He was afraid to be judged by his coworkers. He did not want anybody to know.\n[138] On July 16, 2010, Cst. Desson was informed by Dr. Ross during a telephone call that he cannot do operational driving for 12 months and cannot do administrative driving for 3 months. She informed his managers (Jane Baptista and Walt Sutherland) that his medical profile was updated to O4 with duties solely in law-enforcement support or administration, not subjected to mobilization call out until July 12, 2011 and no administrative driving until a review on October 13, 2010.\n[139] An electroencephalogram (EEG) was performed on July 27, 2010. It was considered abnormal with \u201cspikes arising from the left temporal lobe suggesting a focal predisposition towards seizures arising from left temporal lobe\u201d.\n[140] On July 27, 2010, the complainant\u2019s family doctor, Dr. Ellie Fasihy, declared him unfit for duty until July 30, 2011.\n[141] After reviewing the EEG report, on July 27, 2010, Doctor John Diggle, neurologist, examined Mr. Desson. At the hearing, and via an affidavit he specified that he got the medical history information directly from Cst. Desson and did not have access to previous medical records. The neurologist noted in his July 27, 2010 report that Cst. Desson had recurrent seizures over his lifetime. The first one occurred in 2005 in Ontario. The doctor qualified the episode as a \u201cgrand mal seizure\u201d. His then wife described \u201ca sudden onset, at night when the patient was sleeping, of stiffness of all 4 extremities, and then shaking, diffuse myalgia, petechial hemorrhage, and tongue biting\u201d. He may have had another one in 2007, but never sought medical attention. Another one occurred on May 8, 2010 but no medical attention was provided for the seizure. At that date, \u201cHe felt a sudden unset of anxiety, went to look out the window, and then felt \u201cfixated\u201d developed \u201ctunnel vision\u201d. His LEFT arm started shaking, he developed tunnel vision, and he woke up, at least one hour of time had passed. He had a cut above his right eye. He did seek medical attention for stitches, but no medications were started for seizure prophylaxis.\u201d\n[142] In his affidavit, Dr. Diggle specified that he made the diagnostic of focal epilepsy based on the results of the July 27, 2010 EEG (abnormal and indicative of epileptiform activity); the ambulance report and the emergency room report showing post seizure states; the history of four seizures in the previous 5 years; and the description of the symptoms he experienced or that were witnessed at the onset of his seizures. He added that Cst. Desson suffered from clear postictal confusion. He explained that it is common for individuals with epilepsy to suffer from confusion and disorientation shortly after suffering a seizure. This means a patient may be conscious and in control of their bodily functions but may not be appropriately oriented to their surroundings. Following a seizure, an individual may suffer temporary cognitive defects for a period of time (hours or even days) such as poor attention, poor concentration, poor short-term memory and retrograde amnesia in relation to the period of time (hours or rarely up to a day or more) prior to the seizure.\n[143] Dr. Diggle described the July 14, 2010 seizure event when Cst. Desson was driving:\nAgain, he felt a sudden rush of anxiety, developed a significant tunnel vision and weird, racing thoughts, like pressure of his thoughts. His left arm went numb and then he developed loss of consciousness. The next thing he knew, ambulance attendants, and RCMP were around him; he had bit his tongue in the right rear. He did not lose control of his bladder. He was diffusely myalgic, confused, and disoriented.\n[144] After performing his medical exam, Dr. Diggle wrote his impression as:\nFocal epilepsy, with pressured thoughts, anxiety as his aura. I suspect that the episodes of anxiety or focal seizures, and with secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizures admixed. I suspect that they are arising from the left temporal region, given the spikes on his EEG. The main differential would be a focal epilepsy from the right hemisphere, given the left arm numbness, and it is possible to have bitemporal foci, though uncommon.\n[145] Dr. Diggle\u2019s recommendations included:\n1 MRI Scan of his brain, ? mesial temporal sclerosis\n2 No driving for one year. If he is seizure-free and compliant with medicine, patient can resume driving safely at the 6 month mark, but we will make this ascertainment closer to that time.\n3 He cannot carry a firearm or operate in a position of responsibility for public safety, over the next 6 months. This may place him on short-term disability, unless significant alternate duties (i.e. desk duties) can be found. If they cannot be found, I would consider him medically disabled. If they can be found, he could return to work, with modified duties.\n4 Seizure prophylaxis, He has now had 4 seizures. Some 98% chance of recurrence. I have put him on Tegretol (\u2026)\n5 Disposition. I will see him in follow up in 3 months (\u2026)\n[146] At the hearing, Dr. Diggle added that while triggers may well have played a part in his history of seizures, it did not change his predisposition to seizures due to his temporal lobe epilepsy seen on the EEG. He told Cst. Desson that removing the identified triggers through lifestyle modification was important but would not offer adequate control against future seizures, therefore, he would have to take anticonvulsant medication indefinitely.\n[147] On July 28, 2010, Dr. Ross completed a note in the Health Services Management System (HSMIS) that reads as follow:\nTelephone call with member\nHe had the EEG yesterday. It did show some seizure activity in the left temporal lobe. The neurologist has restricted his driving license (including private) for 6 months. His family doctor has declared him totally unfit for duty for one year.\nHe believes the family doctor made this prognosis because of stress \u2026 he is in the middle of a divorce proceedings, he hates living in BC and now the thought of standing at a bus stop is totally insulting and will likely result in a major depression episode. He has had minor depression episode in the past.\nHe is resentful that his health situation was discussed openly at work (unsubstantiated by writer) and has some difficulties with some of his managers.\nHe has seen Dr Schimpf in the past.\nP; Writer suggested contacting Dr Bowman to formulate a plan and develop coping strategies. Writer explained to member the difference between removal of a firearm for medical reasons and the removal of a firearm for administrative reasons.\n[148] The complainant testified that he was very upset that he could not go back to his regular duties and could not drive a vehicle for a long period. He felt a large amount of stress. He could not picture himself stuck behind a desk on administrative duty and was embarrassed he would have to take the bus to go anywhere.\n[149] On August 17, 2010, Dr. Fasihy, wrote in an Evaluation of Disability Questionnaire from the Respondent that there was a risk of collision if Cst. Desson has a recurring seizure while driving. In the section of Objective Findings, the doctor noted the seizure and the difficulty concentrating. In the section for restrictions and limitations, she noted \u201cPatient states he is unable to concentrate and he is unable to do his regular job duties\u201d. She added that he will be able to return to his regular duties if he is free of seizures for 6 months.\n[150] On September 17, 2010, Dr. Roland Bowman, regional psychologist with the RCMP wrote to Staff Sargent Regina Lyon to inform her that Dr. Schimpf, the treating psychologist, supported a return to work with restriction to administrative duties. He wrote that the complainant would feel more comfortable returning to his own section and was asking where she could best use his services.\n[151] On September 27, 2010, Cst. Desson wrote to his direct supervisor, Corporal Babak Dabiri, that during his last medical appointment, it was decided that he would be returning to work on November 1st, 2010.\n[152] At the hearing Cst. Desson testified that he felt very uncomfortable disclosing his medical information. He explained that when he first started in Burnaby, there were pictures on the wall of people who don\u2019t come to the office because they are off work. He said that this is the \u201cwall of shame\u201d and he does not want his picture on that wall. The Tribunal considers that this was his own perception but no evidence was presented to support that there was a generally stigmatized view of constables\u2019 medical restrictions.\n[153] On September 29, 2010, Staff Sargent Labossi\u00e8re said in an email that Cst. Desson was supposed to come back to work on November 1, 2010 on administrative duties assisting Corporal Clark with the exhibit review.\n[154] In October 2010, Dr. Fasihy wrote that \u201cHe has been unable to work the last few months due to increasing anxiety, recurrent seizures as a result of anxiety, insomnia, headaches and neck pain. His seizure recurrence has increased recently and he has been unable to drive to work.\u201d Dr Fasihy noted that \u201cHe reports increase in his anxiety and stress since 2009 when his ex-wife, Heidi called him demanding money and making threats that she would call his workplace and report him to his employer that he has had seizures in the past and cause his termination from his work\u201d.\n[155] On October 22, 2010, Dr. Diggle wrote that Cst. Desson has had four tonic-clonic (Grand Mal) unprovoked seizures. He specified that there are probable triggers or precipitance that have been sleep deprivation, possible fasting, excessive exercise and ephedrine use. However, his EEG has shown spikes arising from left temporal lobe. He recommends continuing taking the medication Tegretol indefinitely and that he continues to address the triggers that he has identified as doing lifestyle modification. Dr. Diggle wrote:\nI tried to explain the difference between a predisposition towards seizures and triggers for the seizures. I think he is absolutely correct in identifying the triggers and he has gotten a number of different pieces of advice from a nutritionist, alternative health care providers and his own research. Again, I think the information that he has about triggers is absolutely correct; however, he does have an underlying\/latent predisposition towards seizures and he should continue on the anticonvulsant even if he is controlling seizures adequately. (\u2026) He is seizure free and he is compliant with his medication on stable dose of Tegretol. He can resume driving as of January 14, 2011, 6 months after his last seizure.\n[156] Dr. Diggle wrote that Cst. Desson may resume driving as of January 14, 2011.\n[157] On November 6, 2010, Cst. Desson started a gradual return to work on administrative duties at the Burnaby Department. Some of his colleague asked him how his head was doing or how he felt, if he was OK, and even if he had anymore seizures. Cst. Desson testified that it was then clear to him that his medical information had been disclosed and that its confidentiality had been breached. He also testified that the work assigned to him at that time, i.e. preparing orientation packages for incoming members, was a mindless job that was humiliating to him and had no value for the advancement of his career.\n[158] On November 18, 2010, Corporal Ferron sent an email to different people on the return-to-work arrangements for Cst. Desson. Being restricted from driving, carpooling was organized with a colleague, Constable Guiel. His work was set at the Burnaby department under the supervision of Corporal Clark for the review of exhibits and on spare time for orientation packages for incoming members. The work on the exhibits review assignment actually started on November 16, 2010.\n[159] On November 25, 2010, Dr. Fasihy completed a medical certificate indicating that Cst. Desson had been seizure free since July 14, 2010. She added \u201cable to resume full police duty Jan 14, 2011 -pathology resolved\u201d.\n[160] On December 7, 2010, Dr. Ross informed Cst. Desson she had received Dr. Fasihy\u2019s recommendation and wrote in the HSMIS \u201cwe are going to clear you for all duties, except operational driving.\u201d She added: \u201cWhen there is a diagnosis of epilepsy, the guidelines are 5 years seizure-free with a proviso (recommendations for individual patients may differ on an exceptional basis)\u201d..\n[161] On December 10, 2010, Dr. Ross informed Cst. Desson that in order to benefit from the proviso she will need a written letter from Dr. Diggle to specify that he is cleared to do operational driving and why he does not need to wait the recommended 5 years.\n[162] At that time, Cst. Desson informed Sargent Baptista that he will restart his full duties rapidly. Sgt. Baptista answered then that he has not been cleared for driving a police vehicle.\n[163] On December 23, 2010, Dr. Ross informed Cst. Desson that she had a teleconference with someone from Ottawa (Dr. Marc-Andr\u00e9 Beaulieu) about the policy and would like to meet with him to discuss it. The meeting subsequently occurred on January 6, 2011.\n[164] On January 4, 2011, Dr. Fasihy declared Cst. Desson unfit for duty until January 14, 2011. Then she declared Cst. Desson unfit for duty for the period of January 14 to February 29, 2011 because of \u201cdizziness, can\u2019t concentrate\/stress\/anxiety\u201d. The absence was extended until 2013.\n[165] Meanwhile, Dr. Diggle had a telephone conversation with Cst. Desson on January 6, 2011. His report of January 6, 2011, stipulated that according to what Cst. Desson had said to him, every seizure had been preceded by stimulant use (ephedra and ephedra based products). He wrote:\nWhile his EEG does suggest a lower seizure threshold than most other individuals, there are identifiable and proximate triggers to each of the seizures that he has had. While I would feel that the EEG suggest a predisposition, his MRI scan shows no structural abnormalities and his neurologic examination is normal.\n[166] At the hearing, Dr. Diggle explained in his affidavit, that \u201cFocal epilepsy is caused by a structural or inflammatory abnormality in the patient, although it is not uncommon \u2013 as is true in Mr. Desson\u2019s case- for such abnormality to be too small for detection on medical imaging such as CT and MRI scans.\u201d He added that \u201cMr. Desson carries a persistently elevated lifetime risk of seizures.\u201d(emphasis added).\n[167] The doctor recommended that Cst. Desson continues to take the anticonvulsant medication (Tegretol) indefinitely, avoiding triggers, so he can return to full functional duties and a full class 5 license.\n[168] He added:\nI think the differentiating point between proximate triggers for this man\u2019s seizures would be important. Clearly, the EEG does suggest a predisposition, but unlike in many patients with seizures, his did not rise unprovoked. They were each associated with a proximate trigger, being a differentiating point between spontaneous seizures and provoked seizures. As the EEG suggests the disposition, therefore the Tegretol.\n[169] Dr. Diggle added that he was willing to discuss the case \u201cgiven the unusual situation of having proximate triggers, which is a remediation factor in this particular case\u201d.\n[170] At the hearing, through his affidavit, Dr. Diggle added that not all individuals who suffer one or more seizures have epilepsy. For example, those individuals who suffer a seizure for reasons such as alcohol withdrawal, drug intoxication or an infection such as meningitis which do not leave any lasting abnormality on the brain may not have epilepsy. He added that Cst. Desson had four unprovoked seizures and the presence of certain triggers or precipitating factors \u201cdoes not change the conclusion that Mr. Desson\u2019s seizures were unprovoked\u201d.\n[171] On the same day, January 6, 2011, at 15:12, Dr. Ross had a telephone conversation with Dr. Diggle. Her notes indicate that Dr. Diggle agrees with the revised 5 Year Policy, then in draft format.\n[172] At the hearing, Dr. Diggle testified that he does not remember the details of that conversation, but it would be unlikely for him to agree or disagree on an internal guideline for return-to-work, as it is not his responsibility to comment on employers\u2019 policies. His duty is a medical one, making sure that his patient receives the best care possible to avoid a recurrence of future seizures.\n[173] Later on January 6, 2011, Dr. Ross sent a copy of the note to Cst. Desson and had a telephone conversation with him. She explained that contrary to what she had told him on December 7, 2010, the 5 Year Policy does not allow him to return to his full duties on January 14, 2011 as he was previously informed, but he would have to wait 5 years with administrative duties according to the policy.\n[174] Cst. Desson was extremely disappointed with this news. He became suspicious and lost some trust in Dr. Ross.\n[175] Cst. Desson testified that he also had a conversation with Dr Diggle on January 6, 2011 and reported that the doctor told him that he did not see any reason why he should not go back to work on full duties as of January 14, 2011, as previously decided.\n[176] At the hearing, Dr. Diggle added that when he agreed to return Cst. Desson to his duties in January 2011, he did not decide what those duties were, if they were to be administrative duties or full police duties with Code 3 driving etc. This decision does not belong to him.\n[177] Dr. Diggle explained that Cst. Desson had a 15% chance of having no further seizures if he was compliant with his medication:\n[I]n light of Mr. Desson\u2019s history of 4 prior seizures and abnormal EEG readings, without medication, he faced a 98% risk of further seizure. This is based on well-known aggregate data from medical literature which provides statistic on the rate of recurrent seizures in individuals with an epilepsy diagnosis. Other neurologists aware of this medical data may conclude the risk as hign as 100% or as low as 90%. Individuals such as Mr. Desson who have had multiple seizures are at higher risk of further seizure. The same medical data informed my conclusion that Mr. Desson had an 85% chance of achieving \u2018seizure freedom\u2019- or no further seizures \u2013 by taking a single anticonvulsant medication indefinitely.\nThe medical data has established that approximately 15% of patients like Mr. Desson with epilepsy will have a further seizure even when following a single medication.\n[178] He added that the risk of recurrence cannot be individualized and is generalized for all patients who receive a diagnosis of epilepsy. Only the passage of time without a recurrent seizure will reveal how and when a patient achieves seizure freedom and whether, ultimately, that patient will fall into the category of 85% of patients on a single medication without further seizure or the category of 15% of patients who will experience further seizures:\n17. (\u2026) As time passes without a further seizure, the patient\u2019s risk of recurrence diminishes. At the time, given Mr. Desson\u2019s circumstances, medical profile and my knowledge of statistics in the medical literature, I would have considered the risk of Cst Desson having a breakthrough seizure after 3-5 years seizure-free and on medication as very small.\n18. Based on Mr. Desson\u2019s self-reporting, I initially identified that there could be triggering factors or events that may have precipitated Mr. Desson\u2019s previous seizures. However, I ultimately concluded that these triggers did not cause Mr. Desson\u2019s seizures; rather, they may have further lowered Mr. Desson\u2019s seizure threshold. Epileptics such as Mr. Desson are already more vulnerable to seizures than the general population \u2013 thus, having a lower seizure threshold \u2013 and are at much higher risk of sudden incapacitation due to seizure. Certain triggers may exacerbate that higher risk of a seizure, such as stimulant use, exercise\/hyperventilation and sleep deprivation. I concluded that avoidance of any suspected triggers \u2013 such as the use of stimulant, Ephedra, fasting or excessive exercise - alone would not offer reasonable control of Mr. Desson\u2019s medical condition given the number and nature of his prior seizures. Accordingly, I prescribed Cst Desson an anticonvulsant medication \u2013 Tegretol, otherwise known as Carbamazepine \u2013 and throughout Mr. Desson\u2019s treatment, maintained the recommendation that he remain on seizure-controlling medication indefinitely.\n[179] On January 7, 2011, Cst. Desson met with Dr. Ross, Sargent Whitworth and Inspector Schwartz. Dr. Ross explained again that she had made a mistake in their previous conversation about returning to full police duties and that he would have to be on administrative duties for a 5 year period. Cst. Desson said he could not imagine doing administrative duties and thought that his career was ruined. Dr. Ross indicated in her notes that career options were discussed.\n[180] On January 14, 2011, Cst. Desson ceased his administrative duties and went on sick leave for stress and anxiety for two years, until January 2013.\n(b) The Analysis\n[181] In light of this evidence, for the period of July 2010 to January 2011, the Tribunal concludes that Cst. Desson, contrary to his perception, was assessed individually and the 5 Year Policy was not applied as a blanket policy. The evidence also demonstrates that RCMP made numerous efforts to accommodate him in his return to work during that period.\n[182] Indeed, Cst. Desson testified that he refused to admit that he suffers from epilepsy despite the opinion of the Dr. Diggle. His perception of his medical condition is that he had seizures, but they were entirely related to triggers that he had identified as Ephedra, overexercising, and sleep deprivation. He even said to Dr. Ross in a communication in July 2010, that the reason why his own doctor\u2019s prognostic of Dr. Fasihy. of being absent from work for one year was related to stress (divorce, hates living in BC plus taking the bus is insulting) and will likely result in a major depression episode. He did not acknowledge that he suffers from epilepsy. His opinion remained the same even after Dr. Diggle, a neurologist that specializes in epilepsy, confirmed without a doubt that Cst. Desson has epilepsy and will need anti-convulsant medication for the rest of his life even if he avoids those triggers. The source of the seizures is the predisposition for epilepsy that was shown on the EEG.\n[183] In its application of the 5 Year Policy, the RCMP took into account the fact that Cst. Desson had a predisposition of epilepsy shown on the EEG and the diagnostic of Dr. Diggle. RCMP analyzed and made decisions based on Cst. Desson\u2019s specific case. The 5 Year Policy distinguishes between different seizures and the origin of those and when the origin is epilepsy, there is a specific application. That was done in Cst. Desson\u2019s case. The Tribunal also notes Dr. Diggle\u2019s explanation that the risk of recurrences of seizures cannot be individualized and only the passage of time can tell if a person will or will not have a recurrent epileptic seizure episode.\n[184] Facing the reality that he would have to do administrative work and would not be allowed to drive a car for a period of time, Cst. Desson testified that not only was he disappointed, but he felt insulted and humiliated. That was also his reaction when he heard that some colleagues had been informed that he had had a motor vehicle accident and a seizure. His perception was that he would be put on the \u201cwall of shame\u201d and seen that way by his colleagues. As seen earlier, the Tribunal is of the opinion that there is no evidence supporting Cst. Desson\u2019s self-stigmatizing view.\n[185] Despite Cst. Desson\u2019s refusal to accept his condition, and his attitude towards administrative duties, the RCMP tried to accommodate him in many different ways. Indeed, when Cst. Desson informed Dr. Ross that the situation of not being operational and not driving might bring him to a major depression, she suggested contacting Dr. Bowman, psychologist, to formulate a plan and develop coping strategies, which was done and psychologic care followed. In his communications with Staff Sgt. Lyon about the return to work, Dr. Bowman took into account that Cst. Desson would feel more comfortable returning to his own section, as his psychologist Dr. Schimpf recommended. This recommendation was followed as Cst. Desson started a gradual return-to-work on administrative duties at the Burnaby Detachment. Due to the fact that Cst. Desson could not drive, an arrangement was made by the RCMP for carpooling with a colleague. Schedules were organized accordingly.\n[186] Cst. Desson testified that the administrative job that was provided at the Burnaby Detachment (review of exhibits and orientation packages for new members) was mindless, humiliating and did not add any value to the advancement of his career. Cst. Desson is of the impression that his career was ruined by those decisions. The Tribunal is of the opinion that Cst. Desson\u2019s perception is not accurate.\n[187] The Tribunal is of the opinion that RCMP attempted to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s needs to the point of undue hardship. The RCMP made an honest effort to provide all opportunities they could short of undue hardship considering they could not provide operational duties in application of the 5 Year Policy. Instead, RCMP provided him administrative duties in his own detachment during this two month period of November and December 2010.\n[188] On another note, the Tribunal notes that Dr. Ross had made an important error when she told Cst. Desson that his only restrictions would be operational driving for 5 years starting in January 2011. After verifying with Dr. Beaulieu, she then explained that she had made a mistake and that the 5 Year Policy said that he would be restricted for all operational duties, not only operational driving, for 5 years.\n[189] The error made by Dr. Ross affected Cst. Desson. He became suspicious and lost some trust in Dr. Ross. Dr. Ross then suggested that another HSO could continue with Cst. Desson\u2019s file in order to restore the trust necessary between the employee and the HSO. Again the RCMP responded to the situation for the benefit and wellbeing of Cst. Desson.\n[190] Moreover, it was the 5 Year Policy itself that had a very big impact on Cst. Desson\u2019s mental health condition. His ordeal became even more important, as he was on medical leave for almost 2 years after the announcement. The next section will discuss that period.\nJanuary 14, 2011 to January 2013\n(a) The Facts\n[191] During the period of January 14, 2011 to January 2013, Cst. Desson saw Dr. Fasihy and Dr. Schimpf on a regular basis, about once a month.\n[192] On February 23, 2011, Dr. Bowman, regional psychologist with RCMP, noticed the fact that when Cst. Desson returned to work administrative duties at the Burnaby Detachment, he had found it very distressing to be in an operational department while being restricted to administrative duties. Dr. Bowman wrote an email to Sgt. Cathy Shepherd, Career Development and Resource Advisor, to inform her of that. He stated:\nMike is not currently psychologically fit to work. However, he told me that he felt it could speed his recovery if a suitable work placement could be identified now so that he could focus himself on a goal. This makes good sense to me from a clinical perspective.\n[193] On May 18, 2011, Dr. Myron Schimpf, treating psychologist, wrote in his Progress Report that Cst. Desson \u201cwill have considerable difficulty working in a police setting in which he is constantly reminded of that which he is no longer capable of, but at the same time, finding some type of suitable alternate duties will ultimately benefit the member\u201d. Therefore, Dr. Schimpf recommended that Cst. Desson not be posted to a detachment setting in which the presence of operational (in-uniform) police officers would likely remind him of his situation and worsen his status.\n[194] On August 15, 2011, Dr. Bowman reported that he had a long conversation with Cst. Desson and suggested to talk to Staff Sargent Edna Dechant, who manages Burnaby staffing matters, to discuss a non-detachment placement.\n[195] On October 6, 2011, Sgt. Shepherd asked Dr. Bowman and Dr. Johnson if Cst. Desson was ready to go back to a gradual return-to-work, saying that John Bruer was looking for a member at review services. The person would be looking at sensitive expenditures such as payments to intelligence sources.\n[196] On October 7, 2011, Dr. Bowman noted that Cst. Desson does not think that he could go back to work anytime soon. He just could not accept the decision that he was unfit for operational duties. Dr. Bowman noted that Cst. Desson had unilaterally stopped taking his anticonvulsant medication and other medication. Dr. Bowman recommended that he sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Babbage.\n[197] Dr. Bowman then informed Sgt. Shepherd that Cst. Desson was not ready to begin a gradual return-to-work.\n[198] On November 1, 2011, Dr. Johnson informed Cst. Desson that there was a proposal to review the 5 Year Policy allowing a member to return to operational duties if the member is \u201con or off\u201d the medication plus the other criteria. Cst. Desson then said that he will restart his medication with the guidance of a physician.\n[199] On November 2, 2011, Dr. Johnson noted that Cst. Desson received a call from the psychiatrist to make an appointment, but declined the opportunity. He also informed her that he had conducted some research and decided not to take his medication.\n[200] On November 3, 2011, Cst. Desson informed Dr. Johnson, Dr. Schimpf and Dr. Bowman during a conference call that it would be embarrassing and difficult to do a return-to-work at the Burnaby Detachment because people knew that he had a seizure disorder. He would be too ashamed to go back there.\n[201] Dr. Bowman then wrote to Sgt. Shepherd to ask her to take into consideration that Cst. Desson could not go back to the Burnaby Detachment and should be place in a non-operational environment. He added \u201cI would appreciate if you could give some priority to this member: he is understandably finding it very difficult to tolerate the uncertainty of his current situation\u201d.\n[202] On November 16, 2011, Dr. Johnson noted that Cst. Desson had a conversation with Sgt. Shepherd to discuss the positions he would be interested in.\n[203] On December 29, 2011, Dr. Bowman noted that he had a conversation with Cst. Desson\u2019s care provider who indicated that he was fit to work within his assigned occupational restrictions.\n[204] On January 12, 2012, Cst. Desson informed Dr. Johnson that his care provider recommended that he remains off work until March 30, 2012. He also informed her that he does not want to take his medication because he states that he prefers the \u201cnatural\u201d approach.\n[205] At the beginning of 2012, Cst. Desson met with Sgt. Shepherd to discuss a gradual return-to-work. During the meeting, according to Cst. Desson\u2019s testimony, she addressed him as \u201cone of my seizure people\u201d. Cst. Desson was very upset and did not want to be identified that way. Cst. Desson testified that Sgt Shephed even told him that her husband had passed away and she went back to work early, trying to give him hope and encouraging him to go back to work. Cst. Desson testified that she was undermining him and treated him with condescendence. Sgt. Shepherd testified that he was crying, frustrated and very emotional. She had the best intentions and was working to find duties that would be rewarding for him. She was trying to encourage him to get back to work and willing to put the effort towards that goal. Cst. Desson said he was not cleared to go back to work.\n[206] On January 17, 2012, Sgt. Shepherd indicated that she received a request from the integrated proceeds of crime group that she thought would be suitable for Cst. Desson. She was asked when he would be returning to work. Dr. Bowman left a message with his care provider to verify the suitability of the proposed project.\n[207] On February 22, 2012, Dr. Bowman made a new request for Cst. Desson to be seen by Dr. Babbage, psychiatrist.\n[208] On February 28, 2022, Sgt. Shepherd wrote to Cst. Desson saying that she received several requests to staff a gradual return-to-work position. One of them was for the major crimes unit. She is asked if he was cleared to return to work.\n[209] The next day, Cst. Desson wrote that he has not been medically cleared for a gradual return-to-work yet. He wrote \u201cPlease be advised that I will not be discussing any personal medical details with you, or answering questions about my personal medical history, as you know this is confidential\u201d.\n[210] On March 6, 2012, Cst. Desson was assessed by Dr. Babbage, psychiatrist, for the first time. He indicated his impression: 1. Rule out major depression, mild superimposed on dysthymia; 2. Rule out depression due to epilepsy; 3. Rule out medication affecting mood; and 4. Rule out generalized anxiety disorder. Dr. Babbage continued to treat Cst. Desson regularly afterwards.\n[211] On March 14, 2012, Dr. Bowman informed Sgt. Shepherd that Cst. Desson would not be able to return-to-work in any capacity for 3 to 6 months.\n[212] In his May 8, 2012 report, Dr Schimpf identified the occupational restrictions as:\nThere are no psychological restrictions with reference to full operational duties, but of course there is medical prohibition with reference to same (see above). The issue of light\/alternate duties is complex, as the member has been medically cleared for same, but it is here that psychological limitations become relevant. More specifically, the member has long defined himself in terms of physical and athletic prowess (having been a competitive body builder and very active in in various sport-based activities), and being restricted from that which drew him to policing in the first place, is extremely difficult for him. As was pointed out in previous reports, he will have considerable difficulty working in a police setting in which he is constantly reminded of that which he is no longer capable of, but at the same time, finding suitable alternate duties will ultimately benefit the member. Therefore, careful planning and communication (which involves the member) maintains imperative. The writer would reiterate the recommendation that the member not be posted to a detachment setting in which the presence of operational (uniform) police officers would likely remind him of his situation and worsen his status.\n(emphasis added)\n[213] On May 17, 2012, Dr. Bowman contacted the new staffing officer in charge of Cst. Desson\u2019s placement, Sgt. Dawn Parker (Return to work\/Medical Discharge Facilitator, Workplace relations Services, E Division, Headquarters). He advised her that Cst. Desson\u2019s care provider cleared him for administrative duties in a non-uniform environment.\n[214] On May 29, 2022, there was a meeting in Dr. Bowman\u2019s office involving Cst. Desson and Sgt. Parker. Dr. Bowman noted that \u201cit is clear that Mike is still finding it very difficult to adapt to his non-operational status\u201d. He did not want a gradual return-to-work, but a full-time position because he felt a gradual return-to-work would single him out in a negative way. He wanted to work in a federal section but he agreed to try to keep an open mind to consider detachment placements. It was agreed, however, that at this point his care providers are recommending that he not work in a uniform environment and a non-detachment setting is preferable.\n[215] On June 6, 2012, Sgt. Parker wrote to Cst. Desson informing him that if a position were presented to him within his limitations and restrictions and he did not accept it, he \u201cwill have to provide rationale as to why it is not suitable\u201d, as the process cannot go on indefinitely. She invited him to consider what was presented to him very carefully.\n[216] On June 13, 2012, Supt. Aubry (OIC Client Services in Burnaby Detachment) wrote to Dave Nassichuck, that Cst. Desson is a young officer who has aspirations to contribute as a front-line officer in a position that would accommodate his disability and has expressed his interest for accommodation in an operational role. \u201cI believe that he may be a good candidate for further consideration for Special O where he could be accommodated conducting surveillance\u201d.\n[217] On July 3, 2012, Sgt. Parker asked Dr. Krista Johnson, the HSO in charge of Cst. Desson\u2019s file at that moment, about Cst. Desson\u2019s restrictions and limitations. She reported that in the medical profile, the only restriction identified was to administrative duties. In contrast, Dr. Bowman indicated that Cst. Desson\u2019s care provider suggested that it may be too difficult for him psychologically to work in a uniform environment and recommended a non-detachment setting. She asked if Dr. Johnson supported it as an actual restriction.\n[218] On July 13, 2012, Dr. Johnson met with Dr. Bowman, Sgt. Parker and other individuals to discuss parameters for Cst. Desson\u2019s return-to-work.\n[219] More discussions continued with Dr. Schimpf, Dr. Bowman and Sgt. Parker to find a satisfactory position for Cst. Desson and to try to accommodate his desire not to do a gradual return-to-work and not to be in an environment where uniformed personnel are present.\n[220] On September 4, 2012, there was a meeting in Dr. Schimpf\u2019s office (Cst. Desson\u2019s treating psychologist) with Sgt. Parker, Dr. Bowman and Cst. Desson. Cst. Desson stipulated that he would consider jobs in federal positions, in Special O (Special Operations) or have a support position on an ERT (Emergency Response Team), or a position in community policing in Surrey. Sgt. Parker was to undertake to get back to Cst. Desson after doing more research on available jobs.\n[221] In a written conversation with Dr. Johnson, Sgt. Parker asked for the actual medical profile considering that he indicated that neither his physician nor his psychiatrist have declared him fit to work however his profile in the system is still O4. She added \u201cThe way Dr Schimpf and Cst Desson put it [at the meeting in Dr Schimpf\u2019s office] is that he would not be supported to return to work until he is presented with some work options which are agreeable to him\u201d.\n[222] In an email from Sgt. Parker to Dr. Bowman on October 1, 2012, she stated the following:\nFederal position: Due primarily to fiscal restraints, no vacant positions are being filled and as of last week, 80 positions are being cut from the federal units. He cannot be accommodated in a federal position.\nERT: An inquiry was made of the respective CDRA. They cannot accommodate him as they require operational members and do not have work available for a Cst. on full administrative duties.\nSpecial O\u2019: I spoke with Insp. ARNOLD. They are working with just over 60% operational members due to medical leave and members on restrictive duties. He is not able to accommodate another member on administrative duties only.\nSurrey Detachment : Insp. SCHWARTZ agreed to take Cst Desson while on a gradual return to work for a 3 month period however Cst. Desson is to return to Burnaby Detachment after his GRTW, whether he is up to full hours or not.\nAs noted, I have not communicated this to Const. DESSON yet. If you have any questions, please let me know. I would like to speak to Cst DESSON soon and would appreciate any update from his caregivers that you may have\n[223] Dr. Bowman informed Sgt. Parker on October 11, 2012, that he had spoken to Dr. Schimpf who reiterated the recommendation that Cst. Desson work in an environment where his contacts with uniformed members would be kept to a minimum, and that Cst. Desson should be reassured that he will not ever have to return to Burnaby. He suggested to verify the compatibility for the Surrey Detachment work settings. On November 5, he wrote to Sgt. Parker saying that he had a conversation with Cst. Desson\u2019s psychologist Dr. Schimpf who believed that in the interest of his own health, Cst. Desson should return to work sooner than later. Dr. Schimpf encouraged Cst. Desson to fully explore and seriously consider the position in Surrey.\n[224] The same day, Sgt. Parker informed Cst. Desson that members\u2019 positions were being cut and\/or civilianized, fiscal restraint being applied to both federal and provincial business lines including eliminating RM positions. She stated:\nThere is absolutely nothing available along those 2 lines and in fact those members whose positions have been cut or civilianized are also being placed in municipal detachments. You had asked specifically about ERT or Special O. The CDRA [Career Development Resource Advisor] responsible for ERT has advised that they cannot take another member with permanent limitations and restrictions. I also spoke with the OIC Covert Ops and the same applies there, over and above the fact that he has to eliminate positions.\nOne of the municipal detachments discussed was Surrey. The Admin Officer has agreed to have you commence your graduated return to work schedule at that location. I spoke with her recently and the duties will be primarily associated to the front counter so general inquiries, assessing complaints, some investigative work, etc. Surrey will accommodate you for 3 months (or less if you are up to 40 hours within that time period) however you will have to return to Burnaby Detachment after that. This was discussed between Dr SCHIMPF and Dr BOWMAN and the message I have is that your care provider is encouraging you to accept this opportunity. It is very close to home for you, thereby eliminating a long commute as requested and at the very least, it will get you back to doing some real police work. I recognize that a return to Burnaby is not what you desire however there are really no options available right now. I do hope that you contacted Supt. AUBRY as suggested to you by Dr SCHIMPF to discuss potential opportunities for you at that location.\nI would strongly urge you to accept this GRTW placement as a starting point. As you know, the Force changes every day as do the priorities. Other opportunities may come through for you at any time but this is a good chance to get your foot back in the door and show them that you are capable and work towards some of the goals that you have in mind.\n[225] On November 28, 2012 Dr. Ross wrote that Sgt Parker will follow up with the member regarding the Surrey position which has extremely limited exposure to uniform officers. She added that \u201cDr Bowman will review the situation as per Dr Schimpf\u2019s reports: if the sole factor preventing him from working is intolerance of uniforms, the profile will be updated to O4 as this is a staffing issue\u201d.\n[226] On the same day, Sgt. Parker asked Cst. Desson if he had the opportunity to review the email sent on November 5 with regards to the gradual return-to-work at the Surrey Detachment.\n[227] On November 29, 2012, Cst. Desson wrote to Sgt. Parker saying \u201cUnfortunately I cannot except (accept) this position or return to the Burnaby Detachment. These positions are not suitable and conflict with my providers medical recommendations for me to work in a non-operational environment\u201d. He continued, saying that his return to work required a non-operational environment position, preferably in a federal section, as recommended by his medical provider.\n[228] On December 3, 2012, Sgt. Parker had a conversation with Cpl. Ferron from the Burnaby Detachment. In her notes, she wrote that Cpl. Ferron contacted all of his off-duty sick members to discuss how he can assist in alleviating anxiety about returning to work, offering to have them attend the CPO\u2019s to access email, stay in touch with other detachment personnel, etc. and emphasized that the longer a member is away, the harder it is to come back. Cpl. Ferron attempted to determine what a member\u2019s wishes were upon their return to work so they can be accommodated in the best fashion possible.\n[229] On December 6, 2012, Sgt. Parker has a meeting with Sgt. Nassichuk, Sgt. Shepherd, Cpl. Ferron, Supt. Aubry and Dr. Bowman regarding the preferred non-uniform environment. All agreed that this would be a huge issue and possibly career ending for Cst. Desson if it cannot be overcome to some degree. All also were aware that returning to work after such a long absence would likely be quite difficult but all would do what they could, respectively, to support Cst. Desson. A job opportunity at Operational Support Branch would be offered to Cst. Desson at a meeting the following week.\n[230] On December 10, 2012, Sgt. Parker wrote to Dr. Bowman, about a reviewer analysis job description. She wrote it was recognized that Cst. Desson is relatively junior in service and did not yet possess all of the knowledge, skills and abilities that would normally be expected of someone fulfilling this position, however he would be provided all of the support and mentorship required to be successful. She said that she knew quite a bit about the unit and thought that the work was very interesting and operationally focused.\n[231] She sent the job description to Dr. Bowman who sent it to Dr. Schimpf. She wrote that NCO\u2019s wear their uniforms but not every day. \u201cIt is a mixed bag\u201d. Cst. Desson would be expected to wear winter dress with long sleeved dress shirt and tie and dress pants. Even if it was not the ideal situation, she thought that the work and the general environment could be very positive experience for him if he could work through the issue to some degree.\n[232] On December 13, 2012, Cst. Desson attended a meeting with Dr. Bowman, Sgt. Parker, Sgt. Nassichuk, Cpl. Ferron, Supt. Aubry and a representative of the police association (MPPA) Mr. Lee Keane. The objective was to facilitate the return-to-work for Cst. Desson. All were empathetic and encouraged and invited Cst. Desson to talk to any person present should he have questions or need support. There was talk of him commencing a gradual return-to-work at Ops Strategy Branch that was a new entity that would be physically at the Headquarters.\n(b) The Analysis\n[233] In light of this evidence, the Tribunal notes that when Dr. Bowman realized that Cst. Desson had stopped taking his anti-convulsant medication, prescribed by Dr. Diggle for life, he recommended that he see a psychiatrist. An appointment was made, but Cst. Desson declined it. A few months later, Dr Bowman made another request for Cst. Desson to be seen by a psychiatrist. The Tribunal considers that the RCMP made the efforts to support Cst. Desson\u2019s mental health condition by providing him with an opportunity to be treated by a specialist.\n[234] The Tribunal also finds that Dr. Bowman, in his assessment of Cst. Desson\u2019s case, took into consideration his reactions to his previous placement on administrative duties at the Burnaby Detachment. He also took into account the opinion of Cst. Desson about what a suitable work placement would be. He tried to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s needs (non-uniform surroundings, not operational environment, not Burnaby Detachment) when communicating his instructions to the staffing personnel. In those instructions, Dr. Bowman also considered Dr. Schimpf\u2019s opinion which reiterated that there were no psychological restriction with reference to full operational duties but some psychological limitations applied during the period that Cst. Desson was on administrative duties. Dr. Schimpf noted that it would be difficult for Cst. Desson to work in a police environment with colleagues in uniform performing operational duties because this would remind him of what he was not allowed to do. At the same time, Dr. Schimpf indicated that finding suitable alternate duties will ultimately benefit him. The Tribunal concludes that the RCMP through Dr. Bowman tried to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s needs as much as possible in its instructions to staffing personnel.\n[235] Meanwhile, Sgt. Shepherd, acting as the staffing officer, had different conversations and a meeting with Cst. Desson. She tried to find openings that would suit the needs communicated by Dr. Bowman. She proposed certain positions that she thought would be acceptable considering Cst. Desson\u2019s limitations and preferences reported by Dr. Bowman, i.e. Review Services with John Bruer, Integrated Proceeds of Crime, and the Major Crime Unit. The efforts to find a suitable position were not successful as Cst. Desson was not ready medically to return to work. Sgt. Shepherd testified that the meeting of January 2012 did not go well. Cst. Desson considered that she was undermining him and treating him with condescendence and she testified that she was trying to encourage him to get back to work. Dr. Johnson and Dr. Ross testified that the longer a person is off work, the more difficult it is for the person to get back to active duties. Again, the Tribunal finds that RCMP is trying to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s needs in different ways, that are sometimes perceived in a negative way by Cst. Desson.\n[236] In September 2012, Cst. Desson indicated that he would like to work in a federal position or in Special O or ERT. Sgt. Parker, who became the new staffing officer, looked into those possibilities but positions in those fields were not possible because of fiscal restraints and job cuts, the positions require operational status, or there were enough people in the unit on restricted duties. She proposed a position in the Surrey Detachment for a period of 3 months but with a return to the Burnaby Detachment thereafter. Even if the Surrey Detachment proposal did not respect Cst. Desson\u2019s wish and Dr. Schimpf recommendation, the Tribunal notes that multiple efforts were made by the RCMP to support a return to work.\n[237] In light of Dr. Schimpf\u2019s opinion that, for Cst. Desson\u2019s own interest, he should return to work sooner rather than later, Dr. Bowman had another meeting with Cst. Desson, Sgt. Parker, Supt. Aubry and other individuals in December 2012. Another position was offered in a new entity at Ops Strategy Branch at Headquarters. This seems to have been accepted by Cst. Desson and by Dr. Schimpf. The next section will discuss this new opportunity.\n[238] In light of the evidence, during the period of January 2011 to January 2013, while Cst. Desson was off duty sick, the RCMP continued its efforts to try to find him a suitable position. They took into consideration the recommendations of his treating psychologist Dr. Schimpf and his limitations and restrictions. In February 2013, at the same time as Dr. Schimpf declared him not psychologically fit to work, the psychologist added that Cst. Desson had told him that he felt it could speed his recovery if a suitable work placement could be identified. So the work of placement continued. Dr. Schimpf added that it would be preferable that Cst. Desson would not be posted in a police setting where his colleagues would be in uniform and performing operational duties as it would remind Cst. Desson of what he could not do, and it would worsen his medical status.\n[239] RCMP\u2019s efforts to find a position acceptable took into consideration the recommendation of Dr. Schimpf even if it significantly limited the likelihood of a job placement.\n[240] In fact, in August 2011, Dr. Bowman directed Cst. Desson to an officer at the Burnaby Detachment to discuss a non-detachment placement.\n[241] In October 2011, Sgt. Shepherd had a position to offer at Review Services but she was informed that Cst. Desson was not ready to begin a gradual return-to-work. In February 2012, she wrote to Cst. Desson informing him that different positions were open as gradual return-to-work in Major Crimes Unit. He was not yet cleared to start working. The evidence showed that he just could not accept the decision that he was unfit for operational duties. This was a recurrent block to the numerous efforts made by the RCMP to find a placement.\n[242] Cst. Desson also required that he not to go back to his previous Burnaby Detachment because it would be embarrassing and difficult for him because people knew that he had had a seizure and he would be ashamed to go back there. RCMP took into consideration Cst. Desson\u2019s feelings of embarrassment and shame when trying to find him a new placement, as suggested by Dr. Schimpf. Indeed, Dr. Schimpf mentioned at different occasions that there was no psychological restrictions for full operational duties but, for a gradual return-to-work, Cst. Desson would have difficulty working in a police setting as he would be reminded of that which he was restrained from doing. But at the same time, Dr. Schimpf indicated that finding alternate suitable duties would ultimately benefit him. The RCMP took this information into consideration. In light of the fact that most of the jobs are in police settings, the RCMP made efforts to find something that would also accommodate those needs that were not disputed by Dr. Bowman or others. The Tribunal is of the opinion that this shows a high level of accommodation that the RCMP was demonstrating into finding a suitable placement.\n[243] Through Dr. Bowman, the RCMP made many efforts to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s preferences and needs. Dr. Bowman pressed Sgt. Shepherd to give priority to Cst. Desson\u2019s placement, because \u201che is understandably finding very difficult to tolerate the uncertainty of his current situation\u201d. Sgt. Shepherd had conversations and a meeting with Cst. Desson to discuss not only positions that were available, but positions that he would be interested in. She was trying to find a position that would be rewarding to him. She was trying to encourage him to get back to work and was willing to put effort towards it. The Tribunal finds that RCMP demonstrated a real concern not only to the professional aspect of job finding, but the personal interests of Cst. Desson.\n[244] Cst. Desson perceived that at a meeting at the beginning of 2012, Sgt. Shepherd was undermining him and he felt she was treating him with condescension. At the hearing, Sgt. Shepherd refuted these remarks and indicated that she was trying to help him. The Tribunal is of the opinion that in order to decide on the level of accommodation that RCMP demonstrated towards Cst. Desson it does not need to discuss whose perception was justified during the January 2012 meeting. What matters is the fact that the meeting occurred and this was another example of the efforts made by the RCMP to find a suitable job for Cst. Desson even if it was perceived negatively by Cst. Desson. The Tribunal noted that through his testimony, Cst. Desson showed self-stigmatization of his epileptic condition.\n[245] Sgt. Shepherd and Sgt. Parker, who took over responsibility to find a gradual return to work placement for Cst. Desson, tried their best to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s needs and his desires. Many opportunities were considered. Cst. Desson would have liked to work in the federal sector, but as expressed by Sgt Parker on October 1st, 2012, fiscal restraint and job cuts would not permit a gradual return-to-work in that sector. Other opportunities were also not available (ERT, Special O) because of the context at the time. There was an opportunity at the Surrey Detachment but again this was not feasible because, after a 3 month period, Cst. Desson would have to go back to Burnaby Detachment where he had said he would be embarrassed to return. The RCMP took this into consideration and continued active efforts to find something suitable.\n[246] The Tribunal finds that in trying to find an administrative position for his gradual return to work during the period of January 2011 to January 2013, when Cst. Desson was off duty sick, the RCMP accommodated Cst. Desson\u2019s needs and preferences as much as possible. The Tribunal considers that RCMP\u2019s obligation was not to create a job. Assigning him to a federal position or ERT or Special O, would have been undue hardship considering the explanations given by Sgt. Parker in her email of October 1, 2012.\n[247] It is also notable that Dr. Bowman insisted that Cst. Desson be seen by a psychiatrist considering his mental state and he organized the appointment. The Tribunal finds here also the intention from RCMP to honestly help Cst. Desson.\nFebruary 2013 to May 2015\n(a) The Facts\n[248] On February 6, 2013, Dr. Bowman wrote that he had spoken to Cst. Desson\u2019s care provider who supported an immediate gradual return-to-work.\n[249] On February 6, 2013, Dr. Ross mentioned that since anxiety is a major factor, the member would be better off working half-days every day, rather than having days off between shifts.\n[250] Finally, on February 8, 2013, Cst. Desson started a gradual return-to-work at Division E of Headquarters in the Operational Response Unit in an administrative role.\n[251] On March 11, 2013, Dr. Schimpf noted in his report that there had been a degree of improvement \u201cwhich is attributed to the fact that he is participating in a graduated work-return process (with duties entailing provision of security services within a new E Division Headquarters building), with reference to which he feels optimism\u201d. The occupational restrictions were as follow:\nThere are no psychological restrictions with reference to full operational duties, but there is medical prohibition with reference to same (see above). The issue of alternate duties is complex, as the member has been medically cleared for same, but it is here that psychological limitations become relevant. More specifically, the member defines himself in terms of physical and athletic prowess, and being restricted from that which drew him to policing in the first place, is extremely difficult for him. He will therefore have considerable difficulty working in a police setting in which he is constantly reminded of that which he is no longer capable of, but at the same time, finding suitable alternate duties will ultimately benefit the member. The writer has therefore recommended that the member not be posted to a detachment setting in which the presence of operational (uniform) police officers would remind him of his situation and worsen his status. However, the current work-return plan (the provision of security services at the new E Division headquarters) is being relatively well received by the member, and is seen as a good option.\n(emphasis added)\n[252] On April 22, 2013, Cpl. Eric Sheppard informed Dr. Ross that there was a potential staffing for his unit (Operational Response Unit-Duty NCO\u2019s). He wrote \u201cFrom what I\/we can tell, there may be some middle ground that might satisfy the aspirations of this member as well as address concerns you may have with regard to his operability. The ORU is unique and may be a good fit for Mike over the next couple of years\u201d.\n[253] On April 23, 2013, Dr. Ross wrote back to Cpl. Sheppard informing him that the medical profile for the job suggested is O2 (full operational) and Cst. Desson was still O4 (administrative duties only) until July 2015. She added that as an O4, a member cannot be in uniform in public and cannot carry firearms in the context of police work (i.e. while on duty). She then suggested some options like changing the job duty code and confirming that no uniform or firearm carrying were required or, as a second option, if there are parts of the job which require uniformed work and carrying a firearm, the managers could bundle the job in a way that the member can carry out the duties which do not require operational work. This opportunity did not pan out in the end.\n[254] On January 7, 2014, Cpl. Sheppard, who is Cst. Desson\u2019s supervisor at his current gradual return-to-work position wrote to Sgt. Parker and other individuals:\nWithin his role, he has contributed significantly to the efficiency of operations and has been very receptive and motivated in his personal development as a member (on the admin\/ORU management side of the house). Since his arrival, I have been able to develop Cst. Desson\u2019s abilities in several of our Organizational and Functional Competencies, within the ORU and by proxy, the CROPS Secretariat. I am of the opinion that Mike is on a solid path of development in the best environment possible considering his restrictions. ORU\/CROPS also provides him with currency in the current state of operations within the Force (close proximity to CROPS) while being attached to a uniformed unit (ORU). I firmly believe his current role with my unit is providing opportunity to set him up for a strong return to operations and his future as a supervisor down the road.\nI fully support retaining Cst. Desson on the EHQ ORU for the entire duration of his O4 period at which time we can re-assess in July of 2015 when his TO4 status is reviewed.\n[255] On February 13, 2014, the HSO panel reviewed the file and concluded that based on the medical information available, the restriction from operational duties were to be maintained including the use of a firearm. It added \u201cAt this point in time, we have no medical information that would allow us to support special consideration\/accommodation, based on best medical practices already in place. To do so would also be unfair to other members in comparable situations who have not been given special consideration. Should this allowance be given, there is clear risk to the members as well as notable organizational liability\u201d.\n[256] On August 20, 2014, Cst. Desson requested a meeting with Dr. Ross to discuss \u201ccurrent RCMP Policy and Medical profiles from the RCMP Medical Profile Factors Admin Manual as it relates to a member\u2019s operational status. The purpose of the meeting will be an opportunity for an early resolution to my current grievances\u201d. Cst. Desson attached a document to the email in which he explains his view on the issue of the restrictions applied to him and on the 5 Year Policy.\n[257] He also commented on the HSO panel\u2019s response. He stated that the HSO Panel reference to the unfairness to the other members if there were a proviso applied to him showed that he has not been assessed individually. He wrote:\nEach member is to be assessed individually, which should have no bearing on the fairness to any other member. No member, including myself, should be compared to any other member, like I have been here. In January 2011, one week before I was to be back to full operational status, Dr. ROSS called and requested that I attend to her office at E-Div HQ to meet with her. During the meeting, Dr. ROSS told me that I was no longer returning to full operational duties for 5 years. Dr. ROSS apologized, stating that she was confused and did not fully understand the RCMP Medical Policy relating to seizures. Dr. ROSS then stated that there was a female member who had also suffered seizures, but her providers would not clear her fit for duty. Dr. ROSS stated that this confused her, after my providers cleared me fit for duty, and the female members providers would not clear her.\n[258] Dr. Ross answered the same day that she was not able to address this topic again. She wrote \u201cI have used all my verbal and written abilities to relay RCMP Policy around your condition. I do not have any new skills. If I haven\u2019t been able to clarify the situation up until now. I will still not be able to\u201d. She sent him a copy of the answer given by the HSO panel on February 13, 2014.\n[259] Cst. Desson replied that he will continue on with his grievances, complaints to the College of Physicians & Surgeons and or any civil litigation process. He expressed his disagreement with the HSO Panel\u2019s answer and argued that he had not been assessed individually.\n[260] On August 22, 2014, Dr. Ross informed the HSO Panel that she thought that Cst. Desson would be happier to have another HSO managing his case.\n[261] In September 2014, Dr. Isabelle Fieschi took over Cst. Desson\u2019s file in replacement of Dr. Ross. She sent an email asking him to have some documents filled before his return to operational duties in July 2015. She mentioned that the documents have to be filled during the 6 months before the return to full duties.\n[262] Meanwhile, in September 2014, the Career Development & Resourcing advisor, for the E Division, Cpl. Mike Liu verified the operational status of Cst. Desson because there was a position with the Canadian Air Carrier Protection Program available if Cst. Desson were back with the O2 Profile full operational status.\n[263] On December 29, 2014, Dr. Fieschi wrote the following:\nI discussed this member\u2019s situation with Dr Marc-Andr\u00e9 Beaulieu, the acting medical director of OHSB in Ottawa, who also happens to be a neurologist, specializing in epilepsy, on 2014-12-18. Unfortunately, Dr. Beaulieu is moving to a new position with the Public Health Agency of Canada in a few days. He did however, provide useful feedback.\nWithout mentioning the member\u2019s name, I gave him a synopsis of this member\u2019s history of seizures, read out the MRI and EEG results available, the opinions of his neurologists including the fact that they feel there are specific triggers to members seizures. I explained that Dr Ross had initially mistakenly restricted him only from operational driving but soon had to restrict him from operational duties entirely due to national discussion re members with seizures in accordance with the guidelines written by Dr Beaulieu himself.\nDr Beaulieu commented on the fact that it was reassuring that member has not had any seizures for about 4,5 years, since being on medications and stated that the therapy was apparently suppressing them successfully, irrespective of whether other triggers may have been present. He was also reassured by the fact that member has been compliant with treatment for this time. Feels member clearly at risk for more seizures if off meds since there is focal discharge on EEG.\nHe felt that, given that we are close to the 5 year mark with no seizures he would consider putting member back in an operational role a few months ahead of time after a final reevaluation by the neurologist which should include a new EEG, confirmation that medication levels are therapeutic and clear recent opinion from neurologist that member not at increased risk of incapacitation. I asked about another MRI and he stated that this could be at the neurologist\u2019s discretion as he may want to make sure there is nothing \u201cgrowing there\u201d since the initial one which was normal, and that it should be gadolinium-enhanced if performed.\nI also asked whether he would have returned this member to operational duties at or around the 3 year mark if he had been asked then: he stated he would definitely have wanted an MRI at that point but would likely not have returned him to full duties then due to the presence of focal epileptic discharge on EEG. At this point, the additional time elapsed without seizures is reassuring that things are stable, hence him being OK with returning the member to the road a few months in advance of the 5 years mark.\n[264] On January 19, 2015, she informed Cst. Desson of the result of her conversation with Dr .Beaulieu telling him that he could be back on full operational duties before July 2015. She requested the necessary medical documents in order to change his operational status. She also informed him that if in the future there is a change in the medication, or if the medication is withdrawn, he would be put back on administrative duties (O4) for a period of a minimum of 6 months during which he will have to be seizure free. Then medical information will be needed in order to put him back on operational duties.\n[265] On May 26, 2015, Cst. Desson started back on his full operational duties.\n(b) The Analysis\n[266] In light of this evidence, for the period of February 2013 to May 2015, the Tribunal finds that RCMP accommodated Cst. Desson up to undue hardship.\n[267] Indeed, RCMP took notice of Cst. Desson\u2019s anxiety when the gradual return to work occurred in February 2013, as Dr. Ross suggested work half-days every day rather than having days off between shifts, for the benefit of Cst. Desson\u2019s health.\n[268] In 2013, Dr. Ross and Cpl. Eric Sheppard also tried to find an arrangement for a job at the ORU, one of the departments that Cst. Desson had identified as being of interest to him. That job required a full operational status, but even if Cst. Desson was still on administrative duties, discussions occurred between Dr. Ross and Cpl. Shephard on the subject. The Tribunal notes another sign of goodwill to accommodate Cst. Desson\u2019s aspirations.\n[269] Cst. Desson pleaded that the RCMP did not assess him individually but applied a blanket policy without considering his specific condition. As seen earlier, the Tribunal cannot accept this view. The RCMP tried in many ways to satisfy the aspirations and desires of Cst. Desson. In 2014, when a job in the ORU was considered, the HSO panel reviewed Cst. Desson\u2019s file. It concluded that no medical information supported lifting the restriction to operational status a year in advance of the 5 years. The fact that the HSO Panel, in its reasons to refuse to modify the O4 profile in 2014, referred to unfairness to other members and liability to the RCMP does not change the fact that all through the years 2010 to 2015 Cst. Desson was assessed and treated individually.\n[270] Finally the arrangements were not possible, but the Tribunal notes that the RCMP was still trying to find a job that would satisfy Cst. Desson\u2019s aspirations.\n[271] In conclusion, the Tribunal decides that RCMP has proven that it accommodated Cst. Desson until undue hardship during the whole period between July 2010, when he had a motor vehicle accident due to epilepsy, and May 2015 when he went back on full operational duties.\n[272] Therefore, the answer to Question D is yes, the RCMP has proven that the 5 Year Policy constitutes a bona fide occupational requirement within the meaning of paragraphs 15(1) and 15(2) of the CHRA.\nE. If not, what are the applicable remedies\n[273] Considering that the RCMP has proven that the 5 Year Policy constitutes a bona fide occupational requirement, it is not necessary to discuss remedies. Therefore, all the evidence presented to justify remedies, including the effects of the application of the 5 Year Policy on the long term, i.e. after May 2015, will not be analyzed.\nF. Has the RCMP engaged in abusive and obstructive conduct by only disclosing some documents during the course of the hearing?\n[274] The Complainant seeks compensation related to costs due to the conduct of the Respondent during the disclosure stage of the procedure. Some key documents were only disclosed during the hearing that lasted for 30 days. The hearing started on February 23, 2021 and the last hearing date was December 8, 2021. Then the parties provided their written arguments and the Tribunal took the case under deliberations after April of 2022.\n[275] On July 11, 2021, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of procedure (2021-06-03 Canada Gazette Part II, Vol 155, No. 13 (New Rules) came into force for all new proceedings. The new Rules did not apply to matters referred to the Tribunal before July 11, 2011 unless if all parties consent to their application.\n[276] Considering that the hearing of this case had started on February 23, 2021, the former Rules Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedures (03-05-04) apply to the present case.\n[277] Rules 6(1)(d) and 6(1)(e) specify that each party shall amongst other obligations, serve and file a list of all documents in the party\u2019s possession, that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief sought in the case, including those facts, issues and forms of relief identified by other parties under this rule.\n[278] A copy of the documents referred to in the list must also be provided to the other parties with the exception of the privilege documents, according to Rule 6(4).\n[279] The jurisprudence states that if the document at issue is arguably relevant, it has to be disclosed. The standard to determine what is arguably relevant is not a particularly high threshold for the moving party to meet: \u201cIf there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues, or forms of relief identified in the matter, the information should be disclosed...\u201d (Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28, para 6 (Brickner)). However, the demand cannot be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition (Guay v Canada (Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2004 CHRT 34, par. 43)). The documents should be identified with reasonable particularity (Brickner at para 7) and they have to be in the party\u2019s possession, access and\/or control (Clegg v. Air Canada, 2019 CHRT 3 at para 84 to 88). Therefore, the Tribunal cannot order a party to generate or create new documents for disclosure (Gaucher v Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42, at para. 17).\n[280] As a general principle, the Rules of procedure are to be interpreted and applied so as to secure the informal and expeditious proceedings, according to Rule 1(1). They are in place to help parties resolve human rights complaints quickly, efficiently, and fairly.\n[281] Pursuant to subsection 50(1) of the Act, the Tribunal must give the parties a full and ample opportunity to present their case.\n[282] It is therefore obvious that the documents have to be disclosed before the hearing starts.\n[283] In the present litigation, it was not the case for certain documents and the Complainant is asking for compensation for obstruction of the adjudication process.\n[284] During the course of the hearing, at day 11 of the hearing, on May 4th 2021, while the cross-examination of Cst. Desson that had started on the 4th day of hearing, was still being performed, the Respondent\u2019s counsel informed the Complainant and the Tribunal that during the preparation of one of his witnesses (Dr. Beaulieu) a few days before the May 4, 2021 hearing day, he came across a new document relevant to the case that had not yet been disclosed.\n[285] It was a 187 pages document retrieved from the Health Services Management Information System (HSMIS) Case Management. This case management document concerns the Complainant and consists of notes and conversation related to in part to the management of the medical file and the application of the 5 Year Policy to the complainant. This information was added in the system by the HSO and was confidential except to the HSO team.\n[286] The 187 pages documents refers to 83 attachments (PDF files) that were also produced by the Respondent at the 17th day of hearing in on June 29, 2021 when the Complainant finished his evidence.\n[287] The Complainant submits that the Respondent obstructed the adjudication process. He refers to a decision of the Tribunal in First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v Attorney General of Canada, 2019 CHRT 1 (FNCFCS) and to a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Tipple v Canada, 2012 FCA 158 (Tipple).\n[288] In FNCFCS, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal recognized that it remains bound by the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, (Mowat) which found that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to award successful complainants recovery of their legal costs under the head of \u201cexpenses resulting from the discriminatory practice pursuant to section 53(2)(c) of the CHRA\u201d. This is the general principle.\n[289] In FNCFCS, the Tribunal stated that the costs that are requested for abusive and obstructive conduct do not emanate from the Tribunal\u2019s authority to award expenses pursuant to section 53(3)(c) of the CHRA but rather, from the what the Federal Court of Appeal in Tipple describes as an \u201cInherent authority for a Tribunal to control its process\u201d.\n[290] These two decisions describe very unusual facts.\n[291] Indeed, in FNCFCS case, the parties had brought a joint motion in writing to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for an order, on consent, that Canada would pay the complainants and the interested party compensation as a result of Canada\u2019s obstruction of the Tribunal\u2019s process in 2013, as agreed to between the parties.\n[292] There was therefore an admission between the parties of the obstruction that Canada had knowingly failed to disclose 90,000 documents, a number of which were prejudicial to Canada\u2019s case and highly relevant, and found that Canada failed to advise the Tribunal and the parties of this fact at the earliest opportunity. The complainants and the interested party incurred costs thrown away as a result of the late disclosure of those 90,000 documents by Canada and the related three-month delay in the hearing on the merits.\n[293] In Tipple, PWGSC, the Respondent, had engaged in obstructive conduct by repeatedly failing to comply with orders from the Tribunal for the disclosure of information, causing Mr. Tipple to incur unnecessary legal expenses to enforce the adjudicator\u2019s orders. PWGSC displayed a pattern of late and insufficient compliance, which was remedied only after constant pressure from Mr. Tipple\u2019s counsel.\n[294] The facts on which the decision FNCFCS and the decision Tipple are based are quite different from the present case.\n[295] In the present case, not only there is no consent by the parties to acknowledge abusive behaviour of RCMP as in FNCFCS, but there is no evidence of abusive and obstructive behaviour from the RCMP as in Tipple. In fact, the RCMP counsel informed the Tribunal and the Complainant during the course of the hearing as soon as he realized that the HSMIS document existed. This happened when he was preparing one of his witnesses during the course of the hearing. The Tribunal would have expected that this important information would have been found and disclosed before the hearing started, but the Tribunal considers that it was probably due to a lack of preparation and a late discovery of the document or an honest mistake, that the RCMP did not engage in intentionally obstructive or abusive behaviour as in FNCFCS and Tipple.\n[296] Furthermore, a good part of the HSMIS document was already disclosed in the two volumes of the joint book of documents.\n[297] The Tribunal considers that the two cases in FNCFCS and Tipple are very unusual cases with very unusual circumstances that can be encountered only exceptionally. It certainly is not the case in the present case.\n[298] Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that no costs are to be awarded.\nG. If so, is the Complainant entitled to financial compensation?\n[299] Considering the previous conclusion there is no financial compensation awarded to the Complainant.\nSigned by\nMarie Langlois\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJanuary 10, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2276\/3118\nStyle of Cause:\nMichael Eric Desson v.

Overview [1] The Complainant, Christina Gagno, has brought a motion for an order directing the Respondent, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), to disclose:\nA) Any unredacted police officer notes and occurrence reports pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s interaction with the Respondent that led to this Complaint;\nB) Any contracts or agreements between the Respondent and sign language interpretation service providers, for the period of August 2015 to present; and\nC) The Respondent\u2019s Cadet Training Program Overview, dated October 20, 2021.\n[2] On November 9, 2022, the Respondent disclosed the documents relating to item (C) and the Complainant is no longer pursuing that element of the motion.\nII. Context [3] The Complainant, who is Deaf, alleges that she has been discriminated against by the Respondent when it failed to take steps to obtain a sign language interpreter when an RCMP officer met with the Complainant in August 2015 in Langley, BC.\n[4] The Respondent admitted that it discriminated against the Complainant. The parties set out to exchange documents and draft an agreed statement of facts that could expedite the resolution of this matter. This motion arises as a result of the exchange of documents. Statements of Particulars have not yet been filed.\nIII. Issues A) Should the Respondent be required to provide an unredacted copy of the officer\u2019s notes and occurrence reports pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s interactions with the Respondent?\nB) Should the Respondent be required to provide any contracts or agreements between the Respondent and sign language interpretation service providers for the period of August 2015 to the present?\nIV. Analysis [5] It is important to recall the purpose of disclosure requirements. Parties must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case (s. 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., c.H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d)). This includes the right to the disclosure of all arguably relevant information held by the opposing party so each party knows the case they must meet and can prepare for the hearing. See Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2019 CHRT 8 at para. 4 [Egan].\n[6] The Tribunal\u2019s Rules require parties to disclose a copy of all documents in their possession that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief that is sought in the case, including those identified by other parties (Rule 19(1)(e)). This is also an ongoing obligation (Rule 24(1)(2)) (White v. Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, 2023 CHRT 2 at para. 12 [White]).\n[7] The threshold for disclosure is arguable or possible relevance. While this threshold is not particularly high, a party seeking production of a document must still show that there is a rational connection between the document it seeks and the issues raised in the complaint (T.P. v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2019 CHRT 19 at para 11; Turner v. CBSA, 2018 CHRT 1 at para 30 [Turner]). Requests for disclosure should not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition and the Tribunal can not accept as evidence any information that is privileged (Egan at para. 4 and Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2017 CHRT 33 at paras. 31-32; Turner at para 30).\n[8] The fact that documents are disclosed does not mean that they will be admitted as evidence at the hearing (White at para 14).\nA. Should the Respondent disclose the officer\u2019s unredacted notes and occurrence reports? [9] According to the Amended Notice of Motion of the Complainant, the Respondent has produced officers\u2019 notes from the scene of the incident and two documents labelled, \u201cRCMP General Occurrence Report 2015-28031\u201d. The documents are attached as Exhibits C, D, and E to the Affidavit of Salina Dewar filed in support of the motion. Portions of these documents are redacted.\n[10] The Respondent submits that unredacting the names of individuals contained in the officer\u2019s notes would be a violation of the Privacy Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. P-21, and that third party information contained in police officer notes and police occurrence reports are covered by a form of privilege.\n[11] The Respondent also submits that because it has admitted liability in this case and the Complainant has first-hand knowledge of who attended the scene of the incident, that the potential witnesses\u2019 testimony is not essential for the Complainant to prove her case, nor is it arguably relevant.\n[12] The Complainant submits that the officers\u2019 notes and General Occurrence Report contain the officers\u2019 observations of the scene of the incident and the names of witnesses present and that these are relevant to the Complaint and possible remedies. Furthermore, the Complainant submits that the Respondent has offered no explanation of why the reports or officers\u2019 notes are privileged.\n[13] The Canadian Human Rights Commission submits that these notes and reports are relevant to the individual and systemic remedies and that the Privacy Act does not apply to the Respondent\u2019s disclosure obligations. It further submits that the Respondent\u2019s claim of privilege with respect to the redactions is unsubstantiated.\n[14] After reviewing the Affidavit of Salina Dewar with its Exhibits, the Privacy Act and considering the parties\u2019 motion materials, I find that the officers\u2019 notes and RCMP General Occurrence Report 2015-28031 should be produced unredacted.\n[15] At this point in the matter, the Respondent has admitted discrimination, but the scope of the admission has not been defined. Given this stage in the proceedings, it seems self-evident that the identity of potential witnesses and information in officers\u2019 notes and reports are arguably relevant to the substance of the Complaint and potential remedies.\n[16] Furthermore, the Respondent has not established that the Privacy Act prohibits it from releasing arguably relevant personal information in the production of documents under this Tribunal\u2019s rules.\n[17] The Privacy Act states in s. 8(2)(c) that:\nPersonal information under the control of a government institution may be disclosed \u2026\n(c) for the purpose of complying with a subpoena or warrant issued or order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or for the purpose of complying with rules of court relating to the production of information; \u2026\n[18] Therefore, the Respondent may disclose personal information as part of the Respondent\u2019s production obligations in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules. I find the rulings in Windsor-Brown v Royal Canadian Mountain Police, 2020 CHRT 11 and Hughes v Transport Canada, 2012 CHRT 26 persuasive in this regard.\n[19] Furthermore, the information in the documents at issue will be protected by the implied undertaking rule that requires that a party not disclose information obtained pursuant to its disclosure obligations for any purpose collateral to the litigation (Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396) v Canadian Museum of Civilization Corp., 2004 CHRT 38 at para 12).\n[20] At this stage, the documents are not evidence (White at para 14). If they are admitted into evidence at the hearing pursuant to Rule 38 of the Tribunal Rules of Procedure, and the Respondent is concerned about witness names, it can bring a motion for a confidentiality order concerning specific individuals at that time.\n[21] The Respondent has not identified the form of privilege that may apply to these documents, and I find that the privilege claim is unsubstantiated.\nB. Should the Respondent disclose its contracts with sign language interpretation services from August 2015 to the present? [22] The Complainant seeks the Respondent\u2019s contracts or agreements with sign language interpretation services from August 2015 to the present and submits that these are relevant to the relief sought by the Complainant. The Complainant seeks an order that the Respondent take measures to prevent the same type of discrimination experienced by the Complainant from occurring in the future.\n[23] The Complainant seeks disclosure of the Respondent\u2019s contracts in British Columbia, where the incident took place, and across Canada as she is seeking systemic, nation-wide remedies.\n[24] The Complainant has submitted expert evidence in support of this motion describing the steps the Respondent should follow to ensure that the Complainant and other people who are Deaf, deafened or hard or hearing are not discriminated against (Amended Notice of Motion of the Complainant, para 12; Expert Report of Dr. Debra Russell).\n[25] The Respondent submitted that it has 19 employees in \u201cE\u201d Division (the province of British Columbia) that indicate proficiency in ASL and, of those 19, 10 are certified ASL translators. The Respondent stated that it does not have any contracts to disclose, but that when RCMP employees are not able to provide ASL translation assistance, members can contact Language Services Associates (www.LSAWEB.com), a third-party provider. The Respondent explained that each detachment is responsible for contracting with Language Services Associates independently and there is no tracking of the use of this service.\n[26] The Canadian Human Rights Commission takes no position regarding this aspect of the Complainant\u2019s disclosure request.\n[27] A contract between a sign language service provider and the detachment in which the incident took place in August 2015 may be arguably relevant to the issue of whether and how much compensation may be owing under s. 53 of the Act because the Complainant\u2019s expert report refers to the existence of such contracts.\n[28] The Complainant\u2019s expert report further refers to the need for sign language services providers to be accessible in order for the Respondent to prevent discrimination. Therefore, current contracts between RCMP detachments and sign language interpretation service providers may be arguably relevant to systemic remedies.\n[29] I find that the obligation of the Respondent to produce contracts includes contracts that its detachments have with sign language interpretation service providers as the Respondent has a relationship of control with its own detachments.\nV. The Order [30] For all of the reasons above, the Tribunal allows the Complainant\u2019s motion in part and orders that:\nWithin 14 days the Respondent produce unredacted police officer notes and occurrence reports pertaining to the Complainant\u2019s interactions with the Respondent that led to this Complaint;\nWithin 30 days the Respondent produce all contracts or agreements between the Respondent, including its detachments, and sign language interpretation service providers for the month of August 2015 that cover the geographic area of Langley, BC;\nIn light of the principles of proportionality and efficiency, within 30 days the Respondent produce all contracts or agreements between the Respondent, including its detachments, and sign language interpretation service providers in force on the date of this ruling within the province of British Columbia. The Complainant may re-open this aspect of the motion regarding the rest of Canada in the future.\nSigned by\nJennifer A.

Ms. Mercier\u2019s Complaints [1] The Complainant, Tracy Mercier, has filed two human rights complaints against her employer, Correctional Service of Canada (\u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cCSC\u201d) alleging discrimination and harassment on the basis of her sex, race, national or ethnic origin, and disability. Her complaints allege both individual and systemic discrimination by CSC.\n[2] Ms. Mercier\u2019s first complaint alleges that CSC failed to protect her and to provide her with a harassment-free workplace following alleged sexual assaults by a fellow correctional officer at a federal correctional facility in British Columbia. The first complaint was referred to the Tribunal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) in June of 2018, as part of a group of complaints made by female employees against CSC. With the exception of Ms. Mercier\u2019s case, all of the complaints were also made against other respondents, including several individuals. Attempts were made to mediate this group of complaints, although Ms. Mercier eventually opted out of this process. Her complaint was then held in abeyance by the Tribunal until it was severed from the other complaints at her request, in June of 2022. This permitted Ms. Mercier\u2019s complaint to proceed on its own to an inquiry.\n[3] Ms. Mercier\u2019s second complaint relates to allegations that CSC refused to implement her doctor\u2019s recommendations to accommodate her post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) upon her return to work. She says her PTSD resulted from the facts underlying her first complaint. This complaint was referred to the Tribunal by the Commission on September 27, 2022.\n[4] The Respondent acknowledges that Ms. Mercier was sexually harassed by her co-worker on two occasions and that he made offensive and inappropriate comments about her disabilities. However, CSC does not agree that it discriminated against her in the way it responded to her harassment complaint or in its attempts to return her to work.\n[5] At a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) in this matter on November 15, 2022, Ms. Mercier advised the Tribunal that her second complaint had recently been referred to the Tribunal and she wished to join both complaints so that they could proceed to a hearing together. The parties agreed to speak to one another following the CMCC to determine whether they agreed to join the complaints and how this would affect the case management proceedings. The complaints were joined, with the consent of all parties, on November 24, 2022, by an order of the Tribunal. The parties have filed amended Statements of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) to include the second complaint.\nII. November 15, 2022 CMCC [6] At the November 15, 2022 CMCC, several other case management-related items were also discussed, including: the Respondent\u2019s documentary disclosure requirements; ensuring that a trauma-informed process is followed with respect to this complaint; and the scheduling of hearing dates.\n[7] With regard to the disclosure of documents, I note that the discussion during the CMCC related to Ms. Mercier\u2019s first complaint only as she did not bring up her second complaint until the end of the CMCC. The Respondent stated that it anticipated providing the documents from Ms. Mercier\u2019s personnel file (relating to the individual aspect of her complaint) by December 5, 2022. The Commission had previously requested documents from the Respondent relating to allegations of systemic discrimination. The Respondent was unable to provide a precise timeline in which this disclosure could be provided to the other parties, although it did explain its rather cumbersome process involved in producing documents for litigation.\n[8] The Respondent indicated it would take at least four to five months to produce the large number of documents requested by the Commission. The Commission asked the Tribunal to order the Respondent to provide all of its documents by the end of December 2022. It also asked the Tribunal to make this deadline peremptory, so that there could be consequences if CSC failed to comply with the deadline, including that the Tribunal could make negative inferences at the hearing.\n[9] The Respondent said the Commission\u2019s proposal was not realistic and that a request for peremptory deadlines should be made in a motion and not be determined in a CMCC. The Commission\u2019s counsel adamantly opposed the suggestion that a motion should be filed, given the agreement that there would be an expedited process with respect to this complaint.\n[10] The commitment to proceed expeditiously arose out of a request by the Commission in July of 2022 for the Tribunal and parties to respect all deadlines set in this matter and to not seek extensions of time or file unnecessary motions, while expediting the timelines for all steps in the litigation, including a hearing. I accepted that the Commission was asking the Tribunal to make a directive to ensure that all steps to mitigate delay were being taken as early in the case management process as possible. I recognized and agreed that this complaint should proceed expeditiously to an inquiry in light of the delay Ms. Mercier had experienced at the mediation stage.\n[11] During the November 15 CMCC, the Commission also reiterated the importance of utilizing a trauma-informed approach in the case management of this complaint because Ms. Mercier is an Indigenous person who has experienced sexual assault in her workplace. The Commission said the delay Ms. Mercier had experienced since her complaint was filed has impacted her mental and physical health and her ability to return to work.\n[12] Ms. Mercier spoke about how the complaint process has been negatively affecting her. She agreed that scheduling hearing dates would provide her with the assurance that the complaint is moving toward a conclusion. The Commission indicated it was in the process of identifying an expert on the trauma-informed approach and, once it had identified someone, would work with the parties to get consent for a plan to proceed in a trauma-informed way. The parties and Tribunal all agreed to proceed in a trauma-informed way and accepted the Commission\u2019s proposal.\n[13] At the CMCC I issued directions to the parties to keep the complaint moving forward as expeditiously as possible. This direction was informal, not in the form of an order, which allowed the parties to work together where possible to come up with a process and schedule to keep the complaint moving forward. The Commission had proposed setting hearing dates in the fall of 2023 and Ms. Mercier accepted this proposal. Following the CMCC, the parties were to provide their availability for hearing dates in the fall of 2023 so that the first two to three weeks of the hearing could be scheduled. Once the hearing start date was established the Commission was to propose a deadline for the disclosure of the Respondent\u2019s documents related to the allegations of systemic discrimination. I stated that if the parties could not agree on deadlines amongst themselves, I could be asked to impose them.\nIII. The Commission\u2019s Motion [14] On November 18, 2022, rather than following the Tribunal\u2019s directions, the Commission filed a Motion. The Motion asks the Tribunal to make several orders relating to the issues that were discussed during the CMCC. This came as a surprise given the Commission\u2019s position that parties should refrain from filing Motions unless absolutely necessary.\n[15] In its November 18, 2022 Motion, the Commission seeks an order:\nThat the proceedings be carried out, and all related decisions be made, in a culturally and trauma-informed way; That the schedule proposed by the Commission for the litigation steps leading up to and including the hearing be accepted; That CSC\u2019s deadlines be made peremptory; That the individual who sexually assaulted Ms. Mercier in the workplace not be notified of the present Tribunal proceedings; and That Ms. Mercier\u2019s two complaints be joined.\nIV. Analysis [16] All five of the issues that are the subject of the Commission\u2019s Motion were discussed at the CMCC on November 15, 2022 and were either agreed upon or subject to directions that were issued by the Tribunal. Dealing with these issues through the case management process was in keeping with the agreement by the parties and the Tribunal to proceed expeditiously. It was also consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s legislative requirement to conduct its proceedings \u201cas informally as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d (section 48.9(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 [CHRA]).\n[17] Motions should only be filed when there is a procedural or substantive matter that cannot be resolved amongst the parties or when there is a need for an order from the Tribunal with respect to a contested issue. In this case, where an informal process was followed during which these issues were addressed and a path forward was established, filing this Motion was unnecessary and has led to further unnecessary delay.\n[18] I have issued a separate direction with timelines relating to the hearing of this complaint, including the hearing start date and deadlines for disclosure and the preparation of expert reports. Below I will address each of the issues the Commission has raised in its Motion, with the exception of the issue of joining Ms. Mercier\u2019s two complaints. As previously indicated, this was dealt with promptly following the November 15, 2022 CMCC by way of an order of the Tribunal.\nA. Culturally and Trauma-Informed Proceedings [19] In its Motion, the Commission asks the Tribunal not to wait for it to find an expert to make this a trauma-informed and culturally appropriate proceeding. It proposes various pre-hearing measures and safeguards that the Tribunal may immediately put into place to mitigate further prejudice to Ms. Mercier. It says that these measures are proposed with the objective of creating processes that recognize and are informed by the experiences of Indigenous people.\n[20] These proposed measures include: seeking input from Ms. Mercier at all stages, including with respect to special ceremonies or cultural orientation; ensuring she is offered accommodations; providing a predictable, reliable and transparent environment so that Ms. Mercier knows what to expect of the process and feels assured that deadlines will be met; ensuring there are consequences if deadlines are not met; ensuring Ms. Mercier can safely raise during the process whether she is being affected by trauma; seeking to simplify and expedite the litigation as much as possible; and interacting with civility, integrity and humility.\n[21] In her submissions, Ms. Mercier notes that she has not asked for any cultural or trauma-based supports in the proceedings, but she agrees with the Commission\u2019s proposal.\n[22] The Respondent states that it has agreed to proceeding in a trauma-informed way since it was first raised and agrees to the recommendations proposed by the Commission. It does not believe an expert is required to assist the parties and Tribunal.\n[23] In its reply submissions, the Commission states that it has brought this Motion \u201cto put its concerns on record and in an effort to ensure that the present proceeding is carried out expeditiously, fairly, and in a culturally and trauma-informed way. It is the Commission\u2019s view that this goal cannot be achieved informally without the direction of this Tribunal given the history of delay and missed deadlines in this proceeding.\u201d\n[24] The Commission also says that, as far as it is aware, there is no precedent from the Tribunal where similar measures were put in place for a self-represented Indigenous party who is a survivor of sexual assault and who identifies as facing trauma. It says that direction from the Tribunal, informed by an expert, will assist in achieving fairness in this matter and in subsequent matters.\n[25] I note that it is not the purpose of a Motion to put one\u2019s concerns \u201con record.\u201d The parties can do this during CMCCs and through their correspondence with the Tribunal, as well as in their SOPs. All of these form part of the Tribunal\u2019s official record. To the extent that the Commission felt there were specifics to be determined arising out of the CMCC, these could have been addressed less formally, for example by an email or letter asking for direction or clarification.\n[26] The Tribunal regularly ensures its process accommodates the needs of the parties before it. Rather than relying on a \u201cprecedent\u201d with respect to how a particular participant before the Tribunal should be treated, the Tribunal acts in accordance with human rights principles by treating participants in its proceedings as individuals with their own unique needs. So long as the Tribunal ensures that all parties before it are treated with fairness, the Tribunal can modify the proceedings as necessary to ensure that any participant who has experienced trauma feels safe, respected and comfortable during the inquiry. This includes the case management process. Participants should feel comfortable to tell the Tribunal if there are adaptations the Tribunal can make to its process. At the same time, parties should ensure they have any required resources in place to assist them as they advance their human rights complaints through the hearing process.\n[27] With regard to ensuring its proceedings are culturally appropriate, many of the parties who appear before the Tribunal are Indigenous and the Tribunal welcomes requests that ensure parties feel heard and respected during the proceedings. The Tribunal receives and accommodates requests by Indigenous participants for ceremonies and to otherwise ensure that the proceeding is carried out in a culturally respectful and appropriate way. Ms. Mercier should feel welcome to advise the Tribunal how it can ensure the process, including the hearing, is respectful of her Indigenous culture.\n[28] All parties and the Tribunal have agreed to proceed in a trauma-informed way. The Tribunal has read and listened to Ms. Mercier\u2019s concerns and will continue to do so. Ms. Mercier is doing an admirable job as a self-represented Complainant, meeting her deadlines and ensuring her positions are clearly communicated to the Tribunal and parties. I have no reason to doubt she will communicate her needs on an ongoing basis.\n[29] The Tribunal agrees with the Commission\u2019s recommendations and is of the view that most would be followed in the normal course of a proceeding in any event, especially one involving self-represented parties. The Tribunal will ensure that the recommendations set out in the Commission\u2019s Motion are implemented as appropriate during the case management process.\n[30] In light of the commitment to proceed in a trauma-informed manner, counsel should be aware of their own conduct and should do their best not to make case management meetings more divisive than necessary, given that we are all working together in these meetings to proceed to the hearing as expeditiously as possible.\n[31] Proceeding in a less formal manner would have been faster, more considerate of the Tribunal\u2019s and the parties\u2019 time and resources, and overall more in line with a trauma-informed process than engaging in a litigious procedure such as a Motion.\nB. The Commission\u2019s Proposed Schedule [32] The Commission proposes deadlines for certain steps to occur prior to the hearing, including the Commission\u2019s deadline for will-say statements from its experts, CSC\u2019s disclosure deadline, deadlines for expert reports, and hearing dates for an estimated 6-week hearing.\n[33] The Commission says the Tribunal should accept its deadlines in accordance with the agreement that the hearing be expedited. It says that further delay in pre-hearing steps is not consistent with a trauma-informed process.\n[34] Ms. Mercier agrees with the Commission\u2019s position. She included with her submissions an \u201cImpact statement\u201d about how she has been negatively affected by her experience while working at CSC and after filing the complaints, including through the Tribunal process.\n[35] CSC says that, in general with respect to deadlines, it is guided by Ms. Mercier\u2019s stated desire to have this hearing scheduled as soon as possible. It says it has agreed to hearing dates beginning in September of 2023, as proposed by the Commission. CSC states that, in order to be prepared for a hearing then, and for the hearing to be focused, the parties should consider simplifying the proceeding in a manner led by Ms. Mercier. CSC proposes having a further discussion with Ms. Mercier and the Commission about streamlining the hearing, either in a CMCC or in another process. It states that, once a plan is made with Ms. Mercier\u2019s input in mind, it would be in a better position to know what documents it needs to produce and can begin producing them. The Commission rejects this proposal and calls CSC\u2019s proposal to simplify the hearing process an \u201cimproper collateral attack\u201d on the scope of the complaint.\n[36] CSC submits that all parties are trying to move this matter towards a hearing or resolution and statements that further polarize the parties hinder that process. It proposes a \u201crolling\u201d or ongoing production of documents, with a new list every six weeks until six weeks before the hearing. It suggests this will allow the parties to continuously receive its collection of documents until it is complete, instead of all at once. CSC says this will give the parties a longer time to review its documents and, if it is able to produce its documents sooner, it will certainly do so. CSC also proposes its own schedule for expert reports and books of documents.\n[37] In its reply submissions, the Commission says that a party cannot withhold documents and produce them at their discretion, which is what CSC proposes with its rolling disclosure. The Commission notes that CSC, like all parties, has an ongoing duty to produce relevant documents and materials that are created or come into its possession after initial disclosure is produced. It says that permitting rolling disclosure will create a problematic precedent that encourages delay and fosters inequality between parties. It says that this also interferes with a fair process, as it could lead to a situation where the other parties do not have an adequate opportunity to prepare their case or respond.\n[38] The Commission argues that the Tribunal should draw an adverse inference from the fact that CSC did not address all ten points set out by the Commission in its request that its proposed schedule be followed. It also argues that the Tribunal should draw a negative inference from CSC\u2019s refusal to \u201caddress the significant prejudice set out by Ms. Mercier, resulting from on-going delay and a lack of measures or consequences to control the same.\u201d It says the Tribunal must remedy the prejudice and put measures in place to ensure all parties are on equal footing.\n[39] I asked the parties at the November 15, 2022 CMCC to provide their availability to start this hearing in the fall of 2023, following which I asked the Commission to propose a deadline for the Respondent\u2019s disclosure working backward from the hearing start date. If it had done so, and there was disagreement with what was proposed by the Commission, this could have been dealt with in a less formal way, and I would have provided direction or an order for the Respondent\u2019s disclosure deadline. Instead, the Commission filed this Motion.\n[40] I have no intention of drawing negative inferences from the fact that the Respondent did not address all ten points the Commission set out in its Motion. The Respondent chose to keep its submissions succinct and focused on the timing of its disclosure, which is in keeping with the goal of proceeding expeditiously. If the Commission and Ms. Mercier wish to argue that the Tribunal should draw negative inferences in relation to the Respondent\u2019s conduct, they can do so in their submissions following the hearing of the evidence.\n[41] At the same time, I do not accept the Respondent\u2019s proposal that rolling disclosure up to six weeks prior to the start of the hearing is acceptable. This would not be fair to the Commission or to Ms. Mercier, who are entitled to timely disclosure in order to prepare for the hearing. The Commission intends to call three experts who need to review the disclosure related to the systemic allegations prior to preparing their reports.\n[42] The Commission does not seem to share the Respondent\u2019s view that the hearing can be simplified or focused through discussion between the parties, despite it being one of their recommendations for a trauma-informed proceeding to seek \u201cto simplify and expedite the litigation as much as possible [and] encourage the parties to narrow the issues in dispute through agreement.\u201d In any event, this should not lead to a delay in the Respondent\u2019s document disclosure.\n[43] I have set out a schedule, including dates for the commencement of the hearing and deadlines for disclosure and expert reports, in a letter of direction to the parties, separate from this Ruling.\nC. Request for Peremptory Deadlines [44] This is the third time the Commission has asked the Tribunal to make CSC\u2019s deadlines peremptory. The first time was in July of 2022 when it also requested an expedited hearing, which was agreed to by all parties and the Tribunal. I did not consider it necessary to make the Respondent\u2019s deadlines peremptory at that time, when the Commission was asking all parties to make a commitment to meet their deadlines and not ask for further extensions of time. I indicated that, if it appeared that delay was becoming an issue in the case management and inquiry process, any party could raise this with the Tribunal and, if necessary, further measures could be taken.\n[45] The Commission renewed its request for peremptory deadlines at the November 15, 2022 CMCC. As previously indicated, I asked instead that the parties work together to establish timelines, working backward from hearing dates that would be scheduled in the fall of 2023.\n[46] The Commission says in its Motion that it is asking that the Respondent\u2019s deadlines be made peremptory because it is \u201cdeeply concerned about the delay caused by CSC in this matter.\u201d It included a chronology with its submissions setting out steps that have been taken in the proceeding since the complaint was referred to the Tribunal.\n[47] The Commission suggests that consequences for a failure to meet peremptory deadlines could include the following: not being permitted to file documents that have not been produced so far; negative inferences being drawn by the Tribunal; a finding of costs against CSC; or other measures the Tribunal may order pursuant to Rules 9 or 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137 [Rules of Procedure].\n[48] The Complainant agrees with the Commission\u2019s position.\n[49] The Respondent says it understands the Commission\u2019s concerns about the need to move this matter towards resolution or a hearing and will do all that it can to meet its deadlines. It says it does not take the matter of its deadlines lightly and recognizes the Tribunal\u2019s duty to proceed in an expeditious manner.\n[50] The Respondent says that, as Rule 9 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure effectively makes Tribunal-imposed deadlines mandatory, upon penalty of a remedial order or other consequences, an order mandating that its deadlines be treated as peremptory is unnecessary.\n[51] I agree with the Respondent that Rule 9 effectively makes the Tribunal\u2019s deadlines mandatory. The Commission\u2019s chronology does not show that, since my decision in July of 2022, the Respondent has shown a pattern of missing Tribunal-imposed deadlines or behaved in such a way that an order for peremptory deadlines has become necessary. However, if the Respondent fails to meet the deadlines established for its disclosure, the Tribunal will consider how to proceed and what consequences may be appropriate, at that time.\nD. Notification of the Individual Perpetrator [52] At the November 15, 2022 CMCC, the Respondent raised the issue of whether, as a matter of procedural fairness, the individual who it acknowledges sexually harassed Ms. Mercier should be notified about this proceeding. The Respondent was inquiring as to whether the Tribunal or Commission had a process in place to address such situations. Ms. Mercier indicated she was opposed to this, as she became upset even hearing his name. The parties were encouraged to think about this and, if necessary, it could be discussed at a future CMCC.\n[53] In its Motion, the Commission says there is no duty on the Tribunal or Commission to notify the individual of the present proceeding and asks the Tribunal to make this decision through a trauma-informed lens.\n[54] In her submissions to the Commission\u2019s Motion, Ms. Mercier suggests that the Respondent is trying to intimidate her by using the individual\u2019s name in its SOP and by raising the issue of notifying him during the CMCC.\n[55] The Respondent says it did not propose at the CMCC that the individual be notified. Rather, it was simply asking whether the Commission or the Tribunal had a process for notifying the individual or others in his position. It says it is satisfied that it has raised the issue from a procedural fairness perspective and will not notify him.\n[56] This request by the Commission does not properly belong in a Motion. There is no decision for the Tribunal to make.\n[57] I do not agree that the Respondent\u2019s counsel raised this issue as an intimidation tactic, as Ms. Mercier alleges. They were simply asking a question about procedural fairness. Proceeding in a trauma-informed way does not mean that the Respondent cannot ask questions or that the Tribunal can proceed in a way that is unfair to any party. However, we can work together to ensure that issues are raised in a sensitive manner.\n[58] I note that the Respondent continues to include the name of this individual in its correspondence with the Tribunal and the parties. Given that Ms. Mercier has expressed how upset she feels even to hear his name, I would encourage the Respondent to stop including his name in its correspondence with the parties, especially given that doing so is not necessary and it is likely causing Ms. Mercier further stress and discomfort. I do note that the Respondent has begun to give Ms. Mercier notice when this individual\u2019s name appears in documents that it is disclosing to her, which is helpful.\n[59] The Tribunal will certainly consider proposals to ensure that this matter proceeds in a way that does not trigger Ms. Mercier through the use of this individual\u2019s name. This can be discussed during the next case management meeting or through written correspondence. This is what was decided at the November 15, 2022 CMCC in any event.\nV. Conclusion [60] The Commission states in its submissions that ensuring a predictable and timely process is trauma-informed. I agree. A predictable and timely process can be developed informally during a CMCC or through a Tribunal direction. It need not arise out of a Motion. In the present case, filing a Motion has had the effect of causing delay.\n[61] While the Commission suggested that the Tribunal could issue its ruling on this Motion in a CMCC, I note that I did issue directions on the issues raised in this Motion during the November 15, 2022 CMCC. Yet the Commission proceeded to file this Motion. The Commission has also argued that the Tribunal must make its decision with respect to this Motion in a much shorter period than that set out in the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure, because this is an expedited process.\n[62] An expedited process does not mean that the Tribunal must always place this matter ahead of its other files. To do so would be unfair to the other parties who are waiting for rulings, decisions or directions. The Tribunal does not have unlimited time and resources. All of the complaints before the Tribunal are important and the Tribunal has a statutory obligation to proceed expeditiously with regard to all of its matters.\n[63] In Letnes v RCMP, 2022 CHRT 32 (CanLII), the Tribunal reiterated the importance of proceeding promptly and efficiently, while also recognizing the need to conserve its limited resources by not \u201cdeciding every issue that could arise in an inquiry\u201d:\n[20] A recent decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada, Law Society of Saskatchewan v. Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29 states, at para.46, that decisions by administrative decision makers need to be rendered promptly and efficiently. It adds that inordinate delay in administrative proceedings is contrary to the interests of society and undermines a key purpose for which administrative tribunals were created, i.e. expeditious and efficient decision making.\n[21] In Chen v. Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal, 2020 ONSC 6287 at para 12, the Ontario Divisional Court mentions the inevitable delays from bringing additional procedural motions and failing to work out issues with opposing counsel.\n[22] The present Tribunal adds that proceedings before it shall be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow, according to section 48.9(1) of the [CHRA]. The [Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure] also refers to informal, expeditious and fair principles.\n[23] The Tribunal does not have unlimited resources when deciding every issue that could arise in an inquiry. The rules of natural justice and procedural fairness will always prevail, but the Tribunal must take into account the principle of proportionality and its limited resources.\n[64] The parties must be aware that filing unnecessary Motions about issues that could be dealt with less formally through the case management process can lead to delay not only in the present matter, but in other files before the Tribunal. Engaging in a more litigious process such as filing a Motion is not in keeping with a trauma-informed approach and should be avoided in the future, unless it is absolutely necessary.\nSigned by\nColleen Harrington\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 20, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2311\/6618 & HR-DP-2878-22\nStyle of Cause:\nMercier v Correctional Service of Canada\nRuling of the Tribunal Dated: March 20, 2023\nMotion dealt with in writing without appearance of parties\nWritten representations by:\nAnshumala Juyal, Julie Hudson and Brittany Tovee, for the Canadian Human Rights Commission\nTracy Mercier , for\nherself\nLisa Riddle , for\nthe Respondent\n",

ORDER 6\nI. OVERVIEW [1] Frank Kim (the Complainant) is an offender in custody at the La Macaza facility operated by the Respondent, Correctional Service Canada (\u201cCSC\u201d or the Respondent). He alleges in his human rights complaint that the Respondent retaliated against him because he had previously filed two other human rights complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), which were settled. He claims that a psychologist working for the Respondent filed a report at his parole hearing that raised his risk level\/assessment scoring by drawing adverse inferences from the fact that he had made the prior human rights complaints. The Parole Board of Canada (\u201cPBC\u201d) denied his parole application.\n[2] The parties filed their Statements of Particulars, but the Complainant claims that the Respondent\u2019s disclosure is incomplete. He requests an order that the Respondent produce six sets of documents.\nII. DECISION [3] The requests are granted in part.\nIII. CRITERIA FOR DISCLOSURE [4] In Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28 (CanLII) at paras. 4-10, the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) set out the criteria for disclosure. According to s. 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d), parties before the Tribunal must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case. This requires, among other things, that opposing parties disclose arguably relevant information in their possession or care prior to the hearing of the matter. Along with the facts and issues presented by the parties, the disclosure of information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing.\n[5] In deciding whether the information ought to be disclosed, the Tribunal must consider whether the information at issue is arguably relevant. This is not a particularly high threshold. If there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, the information should be disclosed.\n[6] However, the request for disclosure must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d The documents requested should be identified with reasonable particularity. The Tribunal may deny the disclosure of evidence where its probative value would not outweigh its prejudicial effect on the proceedings. The Tribunal should be cautious to order searches where a party would need to make an onerous and far-reaching search for documents, especially where it would risk adding a substantial delay to the inquiry or where the documents merely relate to a side issue rather than the main issues in dispute.\n[7] The disclosure of arguably relevant information does not mean that it will be admitted in evidence at the hearing of the matter or that significant weight will be afforded to it in the decision-making process. Moreover, given that a party\u2019s obligation to disclose is limited to documents that are \u201cin the party\u2019s possession,\u201d the Tribunal cannot order a party to generate or create new documents for disclosure.\nIV. ITEMS BEING REQUESTED [8] With these principles in mind, I address each disclosure request below.\n(i) The Complainant\u2019s CSC Case Management files between November 7, 2014, and the present, unredacted of any material relating to the Complainant\u2019s filing with, or use of the process of, the Commission\n[9] Despite the reference to the Commission in this request, the Respondent apparently understands it to be a request for all its case management files relating to the Complainant, which it claims total 3640 pages. For this reason alone, the Respondent objects to this request as being excessively onerous.\n[10] In his response to the Respondent\u2019s submissions, the Complainant does not specifically counter the Respondent\u2019s understanding about what the request encompasses. He submits that the claimed volume of documents is exaggerated and mentions that he has a pending access to information request for his entire file.\n[11] There is no doubt that the Complainant\u2019s prior human rights complaints are relevant to this case. The current complaint is made pursuant to s. 14.1 of the CHRA, which states that it is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III of the CHRA, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim. Thus, a s. 14.1 complaint can only be about retaliation for having filed a CHRA human rights complaint with the Commission.\n[12] The human rights complaints in question are identified as Commission complaints 20141166 and 20170936 (\u201cthe former complaints\u201d). They were filed in 2014 and 2017. The Complainant claims that the psychologist alluded to the former complaints in making her higher risk assessment in her report before the PBC. The information regarding the former complaints is thus arguably relevant. However, I do not see how any other of his case management files would be arguably relevant. While it is true, as the Complainant notes, that the Tribunal must consider all circumstances to determine whether a subtle scent of discrimination exists, extending the scope of his disclosure request beyond matters directly connected to the former complaints amounts to a fishing expedition.\n[13] Accordingly, the Complainant\u2019s request under this item is granted in part only with respect to documents that mention, refer to or directly relate to the former complaints.\n(ii) Any record of correspondence between the Commission and the Complainant or any discussion about the Complainant\u2019s Commission complaints between November 7, 2014, and August 13, 2018, that are present in any CSC files including his Case Management files\n[14] These documents are probably encompassed in the previous request to the extent that they are in the Respondent\u2019s possession. As the Respondent points out, the Complainant would have received any correspondence addressed to him from the Commission. The Respondent also claims that any copies of the correspondence between the Commission and the Complainant it received had already been included in its List of Documents and thus already disclosed.\n[15] However, the Respondent also submits that any correspondence with the Commission about the former complaints is not relevant. I have already determined that material involving the former complaints is arguably relevant. Providing that information to the Complainant does not constitute a fishing expedition as the Respondent suggests.\n[16] The Complainant\u2019s request is granted with respect to any documents that were not already disclosed.\n(iii) Relevant emails sent or received by CSC staff including those emails involving discussion about the Complainant\u2019s Commission complaints [17] The Respondent agreed to disclose these documents. It states in its reply to the motion that it is reviewing those emails for any privileged information and will be sending them to the Complainant shortly. I observe again that there may be some overlap between these documents and those in the first two requests.\n(iv) The PBC decision granting offender Takahashi release on day parole in July or August of 2016 [18] In his Statement of Particulars, the Complainant compares his situation to that of another offender (\u201cTakahashi\u201d) who was granted parole by the PBC. That PBC decision was apparently reported in the national media. The Complainant claims that he asked the Respondent several times for a copy of the decision with any irrelevant personal information redacted but to no avail.\n[19] The Respondent states that it cannot provide him with documents concerning other offenders nor is it responsible for releasing documents in the PBC\u2019s possession. It also maintains that even though the Takahashi decision is irrelevant, the Complainant could request a copy directly from the PBC, which he did in fact do in November 2021 and is seemingly still awaiting a response.\n[20] It appears that this PBC decision is a matter of public record. According to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, S.C. 1992, c. 20, ss. 143 and 144 (\u201cCCRA\u201d), the PBC is required to maintain records of its proceedings and provide access to its registry to persons who demonstrate interest in a case. As a result, the Complainant can, and apparently has, made such a request.\n[21] While rulings by decision-making bodies are usually considered authorities and are not included in the documentary disclosure process, the Complainant seemingly intends to use the Takahashi decision in a different context as evidence in his case. Therefore, I accept that it is arguably relevant. Although the Complainant has apparently sought a copy from the PBC, it appears he has yet to receive it. If the Respondent is in possession of the Takahashi decision, it should provide a copy to the Complainant. The Complainant\u2019s request is granted.\n(v) A copy of the Complainant\u2019s Dangerous Offender hearing and trial transcripts and exhibits that the Respondent received [22] The Complainant notes that the psychologist\u2019s report referred to a Dangerous Offender assessment of him that was made in 1999. The Respondent repeatedly told him that it had never received a copy of the assessment. Around 2016, the Complainant learned that the PBC had a copy of the assessment, prompting him to file grievances against the Respondent for failing to ensure that information about him is as accurate and up to date as possible, in accordance with s. 24(1) of the CCRA. The grievances were denied.\n[23] However, through correspondence that the Complainant received from the Respondent in November 2022, he learned that, as early as 2002 or 2003, it possessed transcripts of the Dangerous Offender hearing. He submits that the Respondent has been engaged in acts of deception about what it has received and is in its possession and that it must provide the requested information to be transparent.\n[24] The Respondent denies having ever said that it did not possess these documents. The Respondent claims that it merely told him that they are not relevant.\n[25] The Complainant has not established the relevance of these documents to the issue of the present complaint\u2014whether he was retaliated against for having filed human rights complaints with the Commission in 2014 and 2017. The request for this item is denied.\n(vi) A copy of the manuals containing the criteria and instructions for the following psychological and risk assessment tools and any other literature from the developer of these tools:\nSTABLE-2007\nSTATIC-99\nPCL-R\n[26] The Complainant states that the psychologist used these tools to assess him. He questions whether she applied these tools properly and submits that her scoring was not consistent with that of another psychologist who had previously assessed him. The Complainant maintains that the copies must be given to him since the Respondent intends to have the psychologist testify at the hearing.\n[27] The Respondent submits that disclosing the manuals would be in breach of s. 50 the Code of Ethics of Psychologists, CQLR, c. C-26, r. 212, which states that psychologists must not compromise the methodological and metrological validity of a test by revealing the protocol to the client or a third party who is not a psychologist. The Complainant challenges this assertion by pointing out that a copy of the PCL manual was released to him at his 2000 Dangerous Offender hearing, but he no longer has it.\n[28] However, whether or not the regulation would be breached by this disclosure, I find that this information is not relevant to the issues of this case. The question before the Tribunal is not to reassess the clinical merits of the second psychologist\u2019s report and whether her scoring was consistent with the first psychologist\u2019s. These are matters to be raised before the PBC. The issue, as set out in the present complaint, is whether any adverse inference drawn in the second psychologist\u2019s report from the Complainant having filed the former complaints constitutes retaliation for making those complaints, in breach of s. 14.1 of the CHRA.\n[29] The Complainant\u2019s request for this item is denied.\nV. ORDER [30] The Tribunal orders the Respondent to disclose the following items by April 21, 2023:\nA copy of any documents in the Complainant\u2019s CSC Case Management files between November 7, 2014, and the present that mention, refer to or directly relate to Commission complaints 20141166 and 20170936 (the former complaints), including any record of correspondence between the Commission and the Complainant, as well as any emails sent or received by CSC staff involving discussion about the former complaints. The Respondent may redact any personal information about persons other than the Complainant. The Respondent may withhold any documents over which it claims privilege, but they must be identified in a list stating the basis for the privilege claim, in accordance with Rule 20(1) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\nA copy of the Takahashi decision, if the Respondent possesses it.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 21, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nFile No. : HR-DP-2845-22\nStyle of Cause: Frank Kim v.

Introduction [1] Fifteen individuals (two Complainants and thirteen non-Complainants granted Interested Party status, collectively referred to as \u201cthe VRCM Group\u201d or \u201cthe Group\u201d) who had filed a combined\/consolidated motion for compensation in 2014 under the 2012 Memorandum of Agreement (\u201cMOA\u201d) brought a motion on November 7, 2022 that I recuse myself as the presiding member (for reasons of alleged unfairness and apprehension of bias, and perceived conflict of interest) and grant them an adjournment of their upcoming Eligible Work hearing that month. Upon reading the parties\u2019 submissions including case law and upon much reflection, I dismissed the Group\u2019s motion for recusal and adjournment on November 24, 2022, with Reasons to follow. The following day the Group withdrew its Eligible Work motion and the upcoming hearing was adjourned and the file closed, pending the Tribunal\u2019s Reasons. These are those Reasons for Ruling.\nII. Background To Walden Main Proceeding and MOA [2] The Group is comprised of fifteen Vocational Rehabilitation Case Managers (\u201cVRCMs\u201d) in the Canada Pension Plan Disability Benefits section of the renamed Employment and Social Development Canada (\u201cESDC\u201d). (Two members of the Group, Karen Pick and Andrea Taylor, received Walden compensation as Complainants for their work as MAs, and hence already had standing before the Tribunal. Accordingly, they are included in \u201cWalden et al.\u201d in the style of cause\/title of proceeding.) In 2014 the Group brought a motion before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cTribunal\u201d) for redetermination of compensation and other remedies by ESDC, specifically that their work as VRCMs met the definition of \u201cEligible Work\u201d under the MOA, the 2012 settlement agreement.\n[3] The MOA itself is the result of human rights complaints filed by Ruth Walden and 416 other Complainants between 2004 and 2007, challenging the classification of Medical Adjudicators (\u201cMAs\u201d), a group made up predominantly of female nurses involved in the assessment\/adjudication of applications for Canada Pension Plan (\u201cCPP\u201d) disability benefits, when compared to Medical Advisors, a group made up predominantly of male doctors working alongside the MAs. The Walden Complainants alleged that, as a result of their classification, Medical Advisors received better compensation, benefits, training, professional recognition and opportunities for advancement than MAs despite the fact that both groups performed similar work in the assessment\/adjudication of CPP disability claims. They successfully argued that this amounted to adverse differentiation on the ground of sex and violated both sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (\u201cCHRA\u201d). This decision was upheld by the Federal Court on judicial review: Canada (Attorney General) v. Walden, 2010 FC 490. See also the Tribunal\u2019s Liability (2007 CHRT 56) and Remedy (2009 CHRT 16) Decisions, and judicial review of remedy (2010 FC 1135) and appeal (2011 FCA 202) Decisions.\n[4] The MOA was concluded and signed on July 3, 2012. On July 31, 2012, the Tribunal issued a Consent Order implementing the terms of the MOA. The Tribunal retained jurisdiction to deal with any dispute or controversy surrounding the meaning or interpretation of the MOA upon the application of any party or individual who may have performed Eligible Work as defined in the MOA. The Tribunal initially retained this jurisdiction until June 30, 2014, but had since extended this date to March 31, 2015 to determine any outstanding motions (like the Eligible Work ones) filed by said date, and then on consent beyond that date with respect to the issue of gross\u2013up payments only. By November 2019, the last remaining parts of the remedial implementation phase of the Walden proceeding were the VRCM Eligible Work motions of the Group and one other retired VRCM\u2019s motion, which had been adjourned subsequently for medical reasons.\n[5] It is important to note that the Group\u2019s Eligible Work claim is not a new, stand-alone complaint of discrimination dealing with liability or remedy under the CHRA. Its motion is for compensation under a settlement agreement, the MOA, in the context of the remaining part of the implementation phase of the Walden proceeding.\nIII. VRCM Group\u2019s Motion for Redetermination of Eligible Work [6] As noted earlier, the Group originally filed its motion on June 27, 2014. There were sixteen Case Management Conference Calls (\u201cCMCC\u201d) held with the parties, dealing with pre-hearing matters, including motions for disclosure, a motion to limit a party\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony, a motion about the scope of the hearing, etc. Tribunal Mediation was offered several times, but declined by the Respondent. The parties did have \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d and settlement communications over the course of this claim for compensation under the MOA. I made many rulings and orders\/directions over the course of this matter, some reported (e.g., in the www.CanLII.org Internet database), and others orally or via Tribunal correspondence (e.g., CMCC summary letters), and of course all part of the Official Record.\n[7] The Group went through different representational phases: at first represented by fellow Group members Gary Goodwin and Carol Ladouceur from 2014 to 2021 and 2022 respectively, with brief substitutions during that period by various counsel. On September 22, 2021 Mr. Goodwin resigned as lead representative and Ms. Ladouceur was removed by me as remaining representative for non-cooperation\/lack of responsiveness on January 21, 2022. At that point each member of the Group was deemed self-represented. Upon writing the parties and convening a CMCC on March 11, 2022 fellow Group member Aubrey Brenton agreed to consider taking on the role of representative of the Group, with the assistance of Mr. Goodwin, Ms. Ladouceur and the other members. Mr. Brenton confirmed his willingness to represent the Group, and the Group\u2019s agreement that he do so, in April 2022. He remains as the sole representative of the Group.\n[8] After lengthy pre-hearing case management including voluminous disclosure and production of the parties, hearing dates were set for Victoria, B.C. to commence in November 2017. Unfortunately, Mr. Goodwin had surgery scheduled during this time and understandably required post-surgery recovery time. On consent, I granted the adjournment with new hearing dates to be scheduled upon Mr. Goodwin being medically cleared. (The matter was not put into abeyance; case management would continue, as indicated in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons of November 10, 2017.)\n[9] Fortunately, Mr. Goodwin was able to resume his duties as lead representative and the case was further case managed to a new set of hearing dates, with accommodations, scheduled to commence a year later in November of 2018. Unfortunately, again due to medical reasons, Mr. Goodwin sought an adjournment or abeyance until medically cleared. The Respondent opposed. I granted the adjournment. Neither co-representative Carol Ladouceur nor another Group member was willing or able to take on the role as sole representative, which I understand. I note that I had advised the Group orally and in writing that it cannot expect perpetual, automatic adjournments. The Group should consider making alternate representational plans (e.g., represented by a lawyer, para-legal, other member(s) of the Group). I stressed the importance of achieving finality in this matter and the conclusion of the implementation phase of the Walden proceeding.\n[10] I had also agreed to the Group\u2019s suggestion that I swap or switch the Eligible Work hearing queue by putting the Group\u2019s motion on hold and resume the hearing process for the only other remaining Eligible Work motion held in abeyance on consent. (Another former VRCM had withdrawn her Eligible Work motion on October 7, 2019.) The retired VRCM\u2019s motion resumed and was set for hearing. Unfortunately, for medical reasons, she was unable to continue, then was cleared with accommodations, and then medically uncleared again. Her matter remains to this day adjourned without a fixed resumption date pending her medical clearance.\n[11] From October 17, 2018-January 21, 2022, the Group\u2019s motion was in abeyance. (Mr. Goodwin had written on July 9, 2020 that he remained unable \u201cindefinitely due to the chronic nature of (my) conditions\u201d to resume his duties and act as lead at a hearing. No current, updated medical documentation was provided and none was required by me.) But given the likelihood of the other retired VRCM\u2019s claim not proceeding to hearing soon, and upon the Respondent\u2019s request, I decided to hold a CMCC with the Group to discuss \u201cnext steps\u201d including whether the abeyance should be lifted. It was at this point that the Group, or at least their co-representatives, became uncooperative. More than one attempt was made to get the available dates for Mr. Goodwin and Ms. Ladouceur, by correspondence and call\/message from the Tribunal Registry Officer. No response from Ms. Ladouceur was received.\n[12] Eventually, a memorable email was sent by Mr. Goodwin on September 22, 2021 resigning as lead representative, peppered with pejorative comments and a colourful baseball metaphor directed the Tribunal\u2019s way, as follows:\nIt is true that I have delayed responding to the request for CMCC date availability well past deadline. Guilty as charged\u2026I suppose I should not have been too surprised by this [the Tribunal wishing to hold a CMCC to discuss lifting the adjournment], however, as my perception over the seven years of our Motion at the CHRT is that when Ms. Marchildon says jump, the CHRT\u2019s response is often \u201chow high\u201d.\n\u2026\nApologies for the oversimplified sports metaphor in advance, but it often felt like we were a beer league baseball team playing the New York Yankees of the 1950\u2019s and early 1960\u2019s, and the umpire was Mickey Mantle\u2019s cousin (although no one knew that). Although we occasionally got a hit, it was usually the result of an unforced error, and almost every close call at the plate went in the Yankees favour. We never stood a chance, really.\n[13] In response to Mr. Goodwin\u2019s September 22, 2021 email, the Tribunal sent a letter to the parties on October 4, 2021 whereby I advised Mr. Goodwin and the Group that allegations of bias are a serious matter and the proper procedure is for the party to raise said issues at the earliest opportunity in the form of a recusal motion for the member to withdraw from the proceeding, supported by evidence and legal authorities. The Group did not do so until it filed its motion for recusal on November 7, 2022 (based on its November 1, 2022 \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d document) \u2013 thirteen months later.\n[14] Having not received the available CMCC dates from the Group\u2019s representative(s), the Tribunal was left with no choice but to go ahead and schedule a CMCC with all the parties, who were technically at that point still represented by Ms. Ladouceur. That CMCC took place on January 21, 2022 attended by four members of the Group and the Respondent\u2019s counsel and client. Ms. Ladouceur, who did not attend the CMCC, was removed as the Group\u2019s representative. A subsequent CMCC was held on March 11, 2022 attended by four members of the Group and the Respondent\u2019s counsel and client. This was the first attendance by Mr. Brenton who indicated that he would advise if he would represent just himself or one or more members of the Group upon consulting with them. He advised on April 11, 2022 that he would take on the role as lead representative of the Group.\n[15] The Tribunal allotted significant time and resources to assist Mr. Brenton in getting immersed in the file and to prepare for a hearing. We agreed to provide key documents of the file to Mr. Brenton and any other part of the file that he requested. I made it clear at the CMCC that the onus rests with Mr. Brenton to contact the Registry Officer, Judy Dubois, regarding specific documents needed. The Registry Officer spent considerable time preparing and sending key and other documents and dealing with other requests from Mr. Brenton, providing them in the usual electronic format, but also in paper copy per Mr. Brenton\u2019s requests. (This was atypical: normally a new representative would receive the file from the party\u2019s previous representative.) I also directed that the file of the other retired VRCM\u2019s similar Eligible Work motion be made available to the Group, with that individual\u2019s consent. I thought this might be helpful, given the similar issues to the Group\u2019s motion, to see the list of witnesses, summaries of anticipated evidence (\u201cwill-says\u201d) and Table of Contents of proposed exhibits, including any requested copies of the actual documents.\n[16] The Tribunal also set deadlines for the parties to provide any changes to previously filed witness lists and summaries of anticipated evidence from 2018, and provide any supplemental disclosure and production. We also discussed other issues during the renewed case management phase in 2022, including the proposed calling of retired Walden counsel Laurence Armstrong and the mode and location of hearing (i.e., in-person, by Zoom or hybrid).\n[17] I had indicated that I believed that the parties might be able to come to an arrangement by way of agreed fact and\/or joint submission that the Tribunal would not draw an adverse inference from the failure of parties to call Mr. Armstrong or Ms. Marchildon who negotiated the MOA to testify about the intent of the parties to the MOA. If there was no agreement and the Group still intended to call Mr. Armstrong, per my Ruling in 2018 CHRT 20, the Group would need to provide notice to all the Walden parties and Mr. Armstrong and allow them the opportunity to make submissions regarding the lifting of settlement privilege. I set tight timelines at the September 20, 2022 CMCC given the 3-week hearing was scheduled to commence November 28, 2022. The parties eventually negotiated an agreement and Mr. Armstrong was removed from the Group\u2019s witness list.\n[18] The pre-hearing case management proceeded in preparation for the November 28, 2022 scheduled hearing. Updated witness lists\/will-says and disclosure took place. The Respondent had agreed to take carriage of preparing a Joint Book of Documents (intended exhibits) with the assistance of Mr. Brenton. The Joint Book (of under 400 documents) was never filed as the Group had removed itself from the pre-hearing process and brought a motion for recusal and adjournment on November 7, 2022 instead.\nIV. VRCM Group\u2019s Instant Motion for Recusal and Adjournment [19] On October 20, 2022 I denied the Group\u2019s request to change from a Zoom only hearing to a hybrid one (in-person, Zoom hearing). This precipitated the bringing of the motion for recusal and adjournment which the Group signalled twelve days later via its November 1, 2022 \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d. This will be discussed in more detail later in these Reasons.\n[20] The Tribunal scheduled a further CMCC to deal with final pre-hearing matters on October 24, 2022, but was cancelled at the last minute and rescheduled for November 3, 2022. However, on November 1, 2022 the Group wrote the Tribunal Chairperson with an \u201cappeal\u201d of my Zoom mode-of-hearing decision. The Group alleged that I was unfair and biased toward them and had a perceived conflict of interest. The Group wanted the Chairperson to override my decision, have me replaced as the presiding member and an adjournment granted. The Chairperson wrote back the following day indicating that she did not have such authority and that the proper procedure was for the Group to raise the issue before the presiding member. (The Tribunal had advised the Group, via its representatives, of the proper protocol\/procedure for raising issues of unfairness\/bias over a year earlier in the Tribunal\u2019s correspondence of October 4, 2021.)\n[21] The Tribunal advised the parties that it wanted to hold a CMCC to prepare for the hearing, deal with some outstanding case management matters and address the Group\u2019s November 1, 2022 \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\" and adjournment request. Also included on the Agenda was to set a time for a practice run-through session with everyone using Zoom, as had been agreed to earlier by the parties at the June 6, 2022 CMCC, and the matter of the settlement privileged \u201cremedy chart\u201d document that I had inadvertently seen.\n[22] During the November 3, 2022 CMCC the Tribunal dealt only with the Group\u2019s \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d and adjournment request. The other Agenda items were deferred. The next CMCC would take place on November 7, 2022 during which \u201cfiling deadlines for the recusal and adjournment motion will be determined, as well as setting a date for the next CMCC to discuss the remaining items in the agenda for the November 3, 2022 CMCC.\u201d\n[23] At this point, no adjournment of the upcoming hearing had been granted and the preparation for the November 21, 2022 hearing was continuing in tandem with the motion for recusal and adjournment. Mr. Brenton agreed to attend the November 7, 2022 CMCC, but changed his mind, as I read his five emails (sent to the Tribunal since the close of business on Friday) sixteen minutes before the start of the Monday, November 7th CMCC. The Group\u2019s representative would not be participating. One of his emails asked the Tribunal to treat the Group\u2019s November 1, 2022 \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d document as the Group\u2019s Notice of Motion and primary submissions for its recusal and adjournment motion. The CMCC went ahead (with a written summary and audio recording provided to the Group).\n[24] I set filing deadlines for a response and reply, ending November 16, 2022. (The Canadian Human Rights Commission was not participating in the Eligible Work hearing and did not file submissions in the recusal and adjournment motion.) The CMCC summary letter states that I said that I would make \u201cbest efforts\u201d to render a ruling on the motion with reasons (or with written reasons to follow \u201cin due course\u201d) by the Friday before the Monday, November 21st hearing was to commence. I also granted an extension for Ms. Marchildon to see if Mr. Brenton would finalize the parties\u2019 Joint Book of Documents (intended exhibits).\n[25] What transpired thereafter was that there was a technical problem resulting in the Respondent\u2019s motion materials (submissions and authorities) having been sent, but not received by the Tribunal Registry (and I assumed the Group too) by the November 10th deadline. As a result, on November 15, 2022 the Tribunal extended the service\/filing deadline for the Group\u2019s reply submissions to November 21, 2022. Accordingly, the hearing dates for the first scheduled week of November 21 to 25, 2022 were adjourned. The CMCC summary letter stated in underlined format: \u201cThe parties are reminded that unless an adjournment is granted, the hearing will commence on November 28, 2022. The parties should continue to prepare their respective cases for the hearing accordingly.\u201d\n[26] The Group took great umbrage with the above decision, correctly pointing out that I did not seek the parties\u2019 submissions. And the Group had filed its Reply by November 17, 2022. The Respondent had written on November 14, 2022 indicating that, \u201c\u2026ESDC is open to a short delay in starting the VRCM Group\u2019s Eligible Work hearing to give the Tribunal Member the time he needs to fully consider the Group\u2019s recusal motion.\u201d Mr. Brenton wrote further about the Group\u2019s opposition to this Order and the Tribunal replied on November 22, 2022. I note that at no time did the Group contact the Tribunal before my extending the Reply deadline and adjourning the first hearing week to advise that the Group had indeed received the Respondent\u2019s electronic materials by the original deadline.\n[27] The partial adjournment allowed the Group an extra eleven days to prepare solely for the hearing with their work on the recusal motion completed. This is something which I thought would be welcomed given Mr. Brenton had complained about the difficulty and time-requirements in preparing the recusal motion and the hearing at the same time. Finally, the filing extension and partial adjournment gave me the necessary extra time to read and contemplate the submissions and case law in a very serious motion. This enabled me to render a ruling on November 24, 2022 (with reasons to follow) on the motion for recusal and adjournment. (As indicated earlier, the Group chose to withdraw their Eligible Work motion on November 25, 2022 and I then adjourned the hearing scheduled to commence November 28, 2022.)\nV. Issues [28] The Tribunal deals with the following issues:\nHas the Group waived its right to file a motion for recusal; If not, has the Group demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of bias or perceived conflict of interest on my part such that I am required to recuse myself; Is the November 4, 2022 email in question from Mr. Brenton privileged; and Should the hearing dates scheduled to begin November 28, 2022 be adjourned?\nVI. Legal Principles [29] I have reviewed the submissions and case law provided by the parties. In particular, I rely on and apply the legal principles as canvassed in the well reasoned ruling on a recusal motion for bias from Member Gaudreault in Constantinescu v. Correctional Service Canada, 2020 CHRT 3.\nA. Waiver [30] \u201cWaiver\u201d is a longstanding common law concept whereby if a party does not raise an objection of bias at the earliest opportunity, it voluntarily waives the right to raise it at a subsequent time. The idea is to discourage a party from \u201cholding in reserve\u201d or collecting objections\/allegations as to a decision-maker\u2019s bias during the proceeding. It can be considered an abusive tactic. When bias is not raised at the earliest opportunity or immediately as to when the party was aware or objectively ought to have been aware, the genuineness of the apprehension of bias is thus called into question: Constantinescu, supra, at paras. 10 and 33; and Eckervogt v. British Columbia, 2004 BCCA 398, at para. 48. The lack of diligent action by a party may be deemed as acquiescence by same party to the continuation of the proceeding.\nB. Apprehension of Bias [31] Bias allegations are very serious and go to the heart of the public\u2019s confidence in not just the decision-maker or court\/tribunal in question, but the broader administration of justice. Such allegations can have serious reputational implications for the court or tribunal (and the decision-maker) and thus should not be used as a litigation strategy or treated lightly by the party: Hennessey v. Canada, 2016 FCA 180. Thus, said allegations demand the party prove substantive and substantial grounds and raise them at the earliest opportunity.\n[32] Judges\/adjudicators must perform their duties without bias or prejudice and must also be perceived to do so: Wewaykum v. Canada, 2003 SCC 45, at paras. 57-58. \u201cThe essence of impartiality lies in the requirement of the judge to approach the case to be adjudicated with an open mind.\u201d: Ibid., at para. 58.\n[33] A member of the Tribunal is presumed to be acting impartially in the exercise of his\/her quasi-judicial function until proved otherwise: Assoc. des employeurs maritimes v. Syndicat des debardeurs, section locale 375, 2020 FCA 29, at para. 5.\n[34] In addition, as stated in Constantinescu, supra, at para. 75: \u201c[W]hen it comes to recusal, given the strong presumption of impartiality in favour of decision-makers, including those of administrative tribunals, an error, even reviewable, is not sufficient to support a reasonable apprehension of bias. More is needed to meet this heavy burden of proof; the error should not be confused with bias [cases cited].\u201d\n[35] The Supreme Court of Canada set out the test for establishing that a decision-maker recuse himself\/herself due to a reasonable apprehension of bias as: what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically conclude? The grounds must be substantial: Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at pp. 394-95. And a high onus rests on the party asserting it: Cojocaru v. B.C. Women\u2019s Hospital and Health Centre, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 357, at para. 22; and Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 851, at para. 2.\nVII. Parties\u2019 Positions [36] The VRCM Group alleges that \u201cover these many years, a number of issues\/requests, etc. have resulted in what we feel are the ongoing and unfair treatment by Member Garfield since 2014\u2026\u201d toward the Group. Near the top of page 1 of the November 1, 2022 deemed initial\/primary submissions on the recusal motion, the Group enumerates that it wishes to \u201cappeal\u201d the Tribunal\u2019s recent decision that \u201c\u2026unfairly denied our request for a hybrid hearing (part in person, part zoom).\u201d Mr. Brenton at the bottom of page 1 of the Group\u2019s submissions writes: \u201cI will begin by discussing our request for a hybrid hearing and the negative impact of Member Garfield\u2019s decision to my ability to conduct our case.\u201d The Group claims this was \u201conly the most recent of a number of unfair decisions by the Member against our group going back to 2014 when we filed our Initial Motion at the CHRT.\u201d\n[37] As will be analyzed later, my decision to hold the hearing via Zoom was the catalyst or fuse that brought about this recusal motion for bias and adjournment. It is also the first of the eight clusters of bias allegations outlined in their submissions. This was highlighted by the following Group submission: \u201cOnly after his [Mr. Brenton\u2019s] own experiences regarding Member Garfield\u2019s unfair treatment since becoming lead, especially the Member\u2019s denial of our request for a hybrid hearing making it impossible for him to conduct the hearing to the best of his ability, did he, with the support of the group, reluctantly file a recusal motion.\u201d\n[38] The Group also wrote: \u201c\u2026this history of unfairness is an indication of Member Garfield\u2019s long held bias in favour of the Government of Canada and its lead counsel in our case, Lynn Marchildon, and against our unrepresented group.\u201d And further: \u201c\u2026we only know that a number of Member Garfield\u2019s rulings and unsupportive behaviour over the years indicate to us that there is a pattern of unfairness that has led to such a conclusion.\u201d The Group further avers: \u201cLastly, I will discuss what seems to be, at the very least, an appearance of a conflict of interest in reference to Member Garfield\u2019s involvement in our case, or potentially any CHRT case, where the Government of Canada is a Respondent.\u201d\n[39] The Respondent opposes the motion for recusal and adjournment. It argues that the allegations do not meet the high onus of the legal test for recusal based on reasonable apprehension of bias. Rather, ESDC states the Group\u2019s motion \u201cattacks Tribunal decisions made years ago, the proper recourse for which was an application for judicial review challenging the decisions, not an allegation of bias.\u201d It also argues that the Tribunal\u2019s October 20, 2022 decision to hold the hearing via Zoom was a reasonable one and highlighted the assistive measures I ordered for Mr. Brenton in St. John\u2019s, Nfld. to address \u201chis concerns about the technical challenges of a remote hearing.\u201d\n[40] The Respondent further wrote:\nAt best, the Group\u2019s bias allegations reflect a misunderstanding of the Tribunal\u2019s role in adjudicating their motion. At worst, the Group\u2019s allegations of the Tribunal\u2019s unfair treatment, bias and conflict of interest comes perilously close to an abuse of process. Over the course of their eight-year motion, and as set out in the Group\u2019s 18-page motion for adjournment and recusal, the Group has accused ESDC and its counsel of extortion, threats, professional misconduct and off-line communication with the Tribunal all in effort to force ESDC to abandon the hearing and pay the Group members pursuant to the settlement.\n[41] The Respondent also submits that no real or perceived conflict exists from my consultant work for CIRNA. This was a contract from 2011-18 to my company, ADR Synergy Inc., for services rendered as an Adjudicator of claims of abuse brought by former Indian Residential School students. Counsel writes: \u201c[Part-time] Tribunal members are often employed in other companies and workplaces and continue to carry out their duties as administrative decision-makers simultaneously.\u201d ESDC also avers that the Group became aware of this contract \u201cin the early years of its motion [2016]\u201d yet decided not to raise it until November 1, 2022, six years later. This again calls \u201cinto question the genuineness of its claims of an apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal Member.\u201d\nVIII. Evidentiary Issue: November 4, 2022 Email [42] On November 7, 2022, Mr. Brenton sent an email to Ms. Marchildon (and copied to the Tribunal and Commission) asking that an email inadvertently sent earlier by him (meant for a member of his Group) but accidentally sent to the Tribunal and the other parties, be deleted. He was alerted to this error by Ms. Marchildon. Upon becoming aware of this, he quickly responded.\n[43] The dispute lies in the fact that Ms. Marchildon wished for the Tribunal to read the matter as she argues it was \u201chighly relevant\u201d to the present motion and in a damaging way to the Group\u2019s motives, showing that \u201cthe Group\u2019s objectives extend further than just an adjournment and include forcing ESDC into mediation to settle their claim.\u201d Respondent counsel submits this shows bad faith on the part of the Group:\nThis strategy is consistent with a pattern of conduct by Mr. Goodwin whereby, rather than accepting that the only way to conclude the Group\u2019s motion is through a Tribunal hearing, the Group continues to look for ways to circumvent that requirement. Until now, the Group has focused most of their unfairness allegations against ESDC and its counsel. Now they are turning their focus to the Tribunal itself, with the hope that the infinite delay caused by the appointment of a new Tribunal Member will once again force ESDC into settling their claim.\nThe Respondent submits that the email in question is not litigation privileged.\n[44] The Group strongly opposed the Tribunal admitting this email into evidence on the motion, arguing that it is protected by solicitor-client privilege, specifically legal advice privilege, notwithstanding that Mr. Brenton is neither a lawyer nor a licensed paralegal: Chancey v. Dharmadi (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 612 (S.C.J.). The Group even submitted that I not even read it and that Respondent counsel\u2019s written submissions identifying the nature of the email itself is improperly before me.\n[45] I ordered the email sealed on November 7, 2022, and upon considering the submissions, when I dismissed the motion for recusal and adjournment on November 24, 2022, I also extended the sealing Order, making it permanent and ordered the Respondent and Commission to delete their copy. I also decided that it was not necessary for me to read the email\u2019s actual content, although it would have been open to me to do so: M.(A.) v. Ryan, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 157, at para. 39. I relied on the submissions of the parties, including the description, characterization and nature of the email in dispute.\n[46] Having reviewed the case law, I am satisfied that the email, while perhaps relevant, is nonetheless protected by the litigation privilege. Specifically, that the written communication between Mr. Brenton as the non-lawyer representative to one of the members of the Group falls within the class of privilege called litigation privilege. In addition, the leading case on litigation privilege makes it clear that Mr. Brenton not being a lawyer is irrelevant: Blank v. Canada (Minister of Justice), 2006 SCC 39. Unlike the solicitor-client privilege, the litigation privilege arises and operates even in the absence of a solicitor-client relationship, and it applies indiscriminately to all litigants, whether or not they are represented by counsel: see Alberta (Treasury Branches) v. Ghermezian (1999), 242 A.R. 326, 1999 ABQB 407.\n[47] I find that the \u201clitigation avoidance\u201d focus of the email based on the Respondent\u2019s submissions may be considered as a type of litigation strategy. I also find that no exceptions to privilege are applicable here, nor does the inadvertent disclosure constitute a waiver or vitiate the protection of privilege.\nIX. Analysis: The Eight Allegations [48] The Group has enumerated a cluster of eight allegations. I will address and make findings regarding major allegations, but not address every argument and its minutiae. I adopt Member Gaudreault\u2019s approach in Constantinescu, supra, at para. 54: \u201cFor the sake of efficiency and brevity, and as several of the arguments submitted are not relevant and do not assist me in deciding this motion for recusal, I will only address the arguments of the parties that I consider necessary, essential and relevant to a decision\u201d: Turner v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FCA 159, at para. 40. I note that the minutiae or details may be found in the many rulings (with reasons) and orders\/directions, CMCC summary letters and correspondence from the Tribunal, and submissions from the parties over the course of this Eligible Work Motion. They all form part of the Tribunal Official Record.\n[49] Further to the above, it is important to also note that a recusal motion for apprehension of bias is not the proper vehicle for a de facto challenge to the Tribunal\u2019s previous rulings and orders in the proceeding. \u201cIt is also not for me to restate the reasons for my decisions. If a party is not satisfied with a decision, it is always open to them to file an application for judicial review in the Federal Court\u201d: Constantinescu, supra, at para. 76.\n[50] In addition, it is important to appreciate that even if there is a reviewable error, that is not enough necessarily to demonstrate bias. As is discussed in this Ruling, I find the principal arguments of the Group in this bias-recusal motion focus mainly on the outcomes of my numerous rulings, decisions, orders and directions over the course of their Eligible Work motion. I have considered the other grounds of complaint, including the alleged appearance of a conflict of interest.\n[51] Please note that I will be making findings in each of the eight clusters of allegations involving the question of waiver and on the merits. Because of the seriousness of such recusal-for-bias motion, I deem it important to analyze and make alternative findings on the merits even in those instances where I have dismissed the allegation due to a primary finding of voluntary waiver. This was also the approach taken in Constantinescu, supra, at para. 30.\nA. Allegation # 1: Hybrid Hearing Request\n[52] After having discussed the various options for location and mode of hearing (in-person, Zoom or a hybrid of some participating in St. John\u2019s in-person and using Zoom, and the rest of the parties and witnesses via Zoom), the parties agreed to a Zoom-only hearing at the June 6, 2022 CMCC. However, prior to the September 20, 2022 CMCC, Mr. Brenton sent an email indicating that the Group now wished to change the mode of hearing to a hybrid (in-person\/Zoom). During this CMCC we discussed this new request. Mr. Brenton stated, as reflected in the CMCC summary letter, that he felt a hybrid hearing was \u201cthe best way for him to present his case. He also indicated some technological concerns regarding his own computer and the use of the Zoom software program. He also made a request for additional equipment.\u201d I informed the parties that post-COVID (February 2020), \u201cTribunal hearings by Zoom have been the norm, rather than the exception.\u201d (Indeed, at the time of my denial of the Group\u2019s request to change from Zoom to a hybrid hearing on October 20, 2022, all post-COVID hearings to that date had been by Zoom only, without exception.) I note that a party, may prefer, but does not have the right to demand, one technological form of a hearing over another, even if it\u2019s on consent: Cousins v. Silbourne, 2022 ONSC 4000.\n[53] The Respondent advised on October 11, 2022 that it consented to the Group\u2019s request. Thereafter I considered the oral and written reasons\/rationale put forward by Mr. Brenton along with the factors listed in the September 2022 \u201cChairperson\u2019s message: In-person and virtual hearings\u201d on the Tribunal\u2019s website and provided to the parties. On October 20, 2022 I provided my written decision with reasons. My decision letter stated that I was satisfied that a fair and accessible hearing could be held using Zoom and that the Group would not be prejudiced.\n[54] This was to be a hearing with parties and witnesses spread over six time zones, from Victoria, BC to St. John\u2019s, NL. The mere fact of myself, the Tribunal Registry Officer, Respondent counsel and client representative, and Mr. Brenton (and one of his witnesses) being in the same room, while all other parties (14) and witnesses (13) participating remotely via Zoom vs. everyone participating remotely by Zoom, would not have made the hearing any more or less accessible or fair. Mr. Brenton\u2019s technological concerns\/unfamiliarity with Zoom were taken into consideration by me. But when those were balanced with the other considerations in my Decision, the outcome most favoured not changing from Zoom to a hybrid hearing.\n[55] I also ordered accommodations to assist Mr. Brenton in addressing some of the issues that he raised (e.g., technological, home setup\/environment not conducive, etc.), even though this was not a disability accommodation request under the CHRA. For example, I ordered: a suitable conference room in St. John\u2019s be provided for Mr. Brenton to attend with Wi-Fi\/internet connection; and a laptop rented for him to use. (He also could have had a paper copy of the Joint Book of Documents (intended exhibits) for convenience, as I had requested for myself.) The Registry Officer would have been available to assist him (and any other parties or witnesses) before and during the hearing with any technological concerns.\n[56] I do not intend to quote the entire decision here, which is of course part of the Official Record. However, I do wish to make the following points. First, I appreciate that Mr. Brenton is not a lawyer and this was his first time as a representative and party before the Tribunal. Representing parties at a hearing can be daunting and stressful. However, his reluctance to a Zoom hearing format seemed to be based, in large part, on an unfamiliarity with the Zoom program.\n[57] In his September 28, 2022 email to the Tribunal, Mr. Brenton reiterated: \u201cI outlined on the call, my key rationale for such a request. The fairness and accessibility of the form of hearing and the availability of technology and tools is one of the reasons why I put this request forward.\u201d The Group also submits in this recusal motion that the Tribunal\u2019s refusal to change to a hybrid hearing was so serious and \u201cso damaged our ability to conduct a fair hearing that we had no choice but to file a Recusal Motion\u2026\u201d I disagree with that last sentence.\n[58] Early on, at the June 6, 2022 CMCC, the parties had agreed to participate in a Zoom practice session together with the Tribunal. This would have addressed any concerns and answered questions through a real-time demonstration session, including using electronic documents. I take \u201cjudicial notice\u201d that the Zoom program\/app is very user-friendly and has been used by millions of people worldwide, including by Canadian courts and tribunals. The Registry Officer, Ms. Dubois, would have acted as the Zoom \u201chost\u201d during the hearing, handling the technical aspects. All that Mr. Brenton and other participants would have had to do was to have access to a computer with an internet connection and sign-in to the Zoom conference. Unfortunately, by the time we were going to schedule the Zoom practice session, the Group was no longer participating in the pre-hearing process, instead focussing solely on its motion for recusal and adjournment.\n[59] The Respondent submits that my October 20, 2022 decision (including assistive measures ordered) was a reasonable one and certainly did not demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias on my part. Based on my review of the October 20, 2022 decision and the submissions and case law filed on this instant motion, I find that the Tribunal\u2019s denial of the Group\u2019s request to change to a hybrid hearing format does not constitute a reasonable apprehension of bias. The Tribunal\u2019s October 20, 2022 decision was a reasonable one, balancing the various factors, with no indicia of an appearance of bias.\n[60] At its highest, an allegation that the Tribunal erred in a decision might justify a judicial review, but it is not, in itself, proof of bias, real or perceived. Declining to have the Tribunal incur significant costs (such as travel) to accommodate a party\u2019s request to change the mode of hearing two months before the start of a motion-hearing for example, is not evidence of bias. This is especially true when the party requesting the change had declined to even engage with the supports the Tribunal had offered to support their participation in the Zoom hearing that both parties had earlier agreed to.\nB. Allegation #2: Proposed Testimony of Mr. Armstrong [61] The Group\u2019s bias allegation here centres on the process for calling Laurence Armstrong, counsel to most of the Walden Complainants, to testify about the intent of the parties, leading up to and including the settlement discussions that resulted in the finalization of the MOA. He and Ms. Marchildon negotiated the MOA. The Group argues that the process for calling Mr. Armstrong demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of bias on the Tribunal\u2019s part.\n[62] The Respondent counters that the Group should be barred by waiver from bringing this allegation in its recusal motion in 2022, \u201c[g]iven the Group raised these issues as early as 2016 and the Tribunal ruled on them in 2018...\u201d\n[63] Disclosure issues and the intention to call Mr. Armstrong were indeed raised in 2016 by the Group. As reflected too in its submissions in the present recusal motion, the Group was concerned and clearly disagreed with my interpretation and application of the \u201cEligible Work\u201d definition in the MOA in Walden et al. v. Attorney General, 2015 CHRT 15 (\u201cMcIlroy\u201d Eligible Work Decision). The topic of calling Mr. Armstrong was mentioned in the Tribunal\u2019s Ruling on the scope of the hearing and related issues, cited as 2016 CHRT 19, at para. 29.\n[64] I indicated in 2016 and thereafter that I questioned the need for calling Mr. Armstrong (or for that matter, Ms. Marchildon as the other negotiator of the MOA). I invited the parties to attempt to arrive at a solution such as an agreed fact, or joint submission that no adverse inference would be drawn, etc. The parties eventually came to an agreement in 2022 and Mr. Armstrong was taken off the witness list by the Group.\n[65] In 2018 the Group still wished to have Mr. Armstrong testify. The Commission (then participating in CMCCs) and Respondent both took the position that Mr. Armstrong\u2019s testimony would include settlement privileged communication requiring that all Walden parties (not just those represented by Mr. Armstrong) be given notice and an opportunity to make submissions on the motion, including whether they waive privilege and the settlement privilege should be lifted. (The Commission and Respondent indicated that they were not waiving privilege.)\n[66] In my Ruling, 2018 CHRT 20, at paras. 35-36, I required the Group to serve all parties and Mr. Armstrong with their Notice of Motion requesting that I lift the settlement privilege and allow Mr. Armstrong to testify on such matters at their Eligible Work hearing. My Ruling, including the Order, is quite clear. At para. 37, the Tribunal wrote: \u201cIf the Goodwin Group wishes to proceed, the Tribunal will issue a Direction regarding the \u201cnext steps\u201d to be followed and addressing the logistical considerations involving such a large group.\u201d\n[67] The Group failed to meet the July 13, 2018 deadline in the Order to advise the Tribunal if it still sought the issuance of a Summons to Appear to compel the testimony of Mr. Armstrong and pursue its motion for production of one of the letters in dispute. The Tribunal wrote the parties on July 20, 2018 in part:\nIt is trite to say that any requests to vary an order by way of extension or otherwise should be made before any deadline.\n\u2026\nMy Order did not stipulate any conditions (i.e., that the Respondent advise whether it wishes to participate in a Tribunal mediation before the Goodwin Group indicates if it wishes to pursue its production and summons motion).\n\u2026\nAs a result, I would like to convene a CMCC next week if possible to deal with the issues raised in para. 37 of my June 29th Ruling (i.e., admission, agreed fact and\/or joint submission, and the \u201cnext steps\u201d protocol should the production and summons motion proceed).\n[68] The Group confirmed in writing on July 25, 2018 that it still intended to call Mr. Armstrong as a witness. The Tribunal\u2019s letter to the parties the following day notes this passage from the Group\u2019s letter: \u201c\u2026the Goodwin Group will not agree to attend a CMCC until the Respondent has provided a response to the CHRT\u2019s offer of Mediation Services\u2026\u201d Ms. Marchildon advised on September 4, 2018 that, \u201cESDC has instructed that it does not wish to make use of the Tribunal\u2019s mediation services. I have advised Mr. Goodwin and Ms. Ladouceur of this fact and the reason for it in a separate email to them.\u201d\n[69] While the Group indicated on July 25, 2018 that it still wished to call Mr. Armstrong, they continued thereafter to refuse to provide their availability dates for a CMCC. As a result, no CMCC was scheduled, and no \u201cnext steps\u201d Direction was issued as the Eligible Work hearing scheduled to commence November 5, 2018 was adjourned sine die (with no fixed resumption date) for medical reasons on October 17, 2018 (full reasons issued February 18, 2019).\n[70] It is clear from the above that while the Group may not have known of the exact composition of the \u201cnext steps\u201d in the process for compelling Mr. Armstrong\u2019s testimony from Ruling 2018 CHRT 20, it was aware or reasonably ought to have been that it would involve serving all 417 Walden Complainants, the Commission, the Respondent, and Mr. Armstrong. And there was no indication that anyone other than the Group would be responsible for expending the time and cost of doing so.\n[71] However, in fairness to the Group, and consistent with its submissions herein, its major contention centres around the process for calling Mr. Armstrong and the exact, detailed requirements, including setting out the steps and deadlines, and the resources it would have to expend (time and cost). And the \u201cnext steps\u201d protocol was not set out in detail until the September 20, 2022 CMCC. Most of the time spent on the Agenda items focussed on item #2 \u201cProposed testimony of Mr. Armstrong; will-say\u201d and #3 \u201cLogistical issues\/next steps\/timelines in notice of motion.\u201d I made it clear again that the Group would be responsible for the time and cost for providing notice and the carriage of the motion. I also indicated that it was not the appropriate role of the Tribunal to serve a party\u2019s notice of motion and other related documents. I also encouraged the parties to speak and see if they could come up with an alternative not requiring Mr. Armstrong\u2019s testimony, to which the parties eventually came to an agreement. Additionally, I went over the requirements of the Ruling, 2018 CHRT 20.\n[72] The timelines set were tight given the upcoming hearing was scheduled to begin two months later, on November 21, 2022 (later adjourned to November 28, 2020). While tight, they were doable in my opinion, the first deadline being September 30, 2022 and the last one November 7, 2022, with the Tribunal\u2019s Ruling on whether the settlement privilege would be lifted, to be rendered before the hearing commenced. (On October 7, 2022 the Tribunal granted the Group\u2019s two extension requests. The new Reply submissions deadline would be November 14, 2022.) While the Group stated that it was unfair, it never accused the Tribunal of bias or an apprehension of bias over this, until the \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d document was sent on November 1, 2022.\n[73] Based on the foregoing, I find that waiver is not applicable here. On a generous, liberal interpretation, I find that the Group did not know the exact, specific logistical requirements, particularly the timelines, until the September 20, 2022 CMCC, although the Group was aware early on who it would need to serve. The Group took just over a month to raise the bias spectre in this matter on November 1, 2022, then in its official November 6, 2022 email bringing its recusal motion before me. Of note, the Group did not bring its recusal motion until after the Tribunal\u2019s October 20, 2022 hybrid hearing denial decision, the catalyst\/trigger for the recusal motion.\n[74] Turning to the issue of the process for receiving Mr. Armstrong\u2019s testimony and whether it demonstrates an apprehension of bias on the merits, I find that it does not. The Ruling was a reasonable one and the \u201cnext steps\u201d protocol too. The issue of Mr. Armstrong\u2019s testimony had been raised in 2016, adjudicated in 2018 and resumed in 2022. The timelines imposed for calling Mr. Armstrong were appropriate in the circumstances given that the Group confirmed in September 2022 that it still wished to call Mr. Armstrong at the scheduled November 2022 hearing. That the dates were compressed and complying with them involved significant work for Mr. Brenton is only a reflection of the September-November time window, rather than any unfairness or bias on the part of the Tribunal. Indeed, the Tribunal attempted to facilitate this process by providing contact information and suggested wording to the Group. That the Tribunal did not assume the Group\u2019s responsibility to serve appropriate notice cannot form the basis for a successful bias motion. I find that the Group has failed to meet the high threshold test of establishing an apprehension of bias in this allegation.\nC. Allegation #3: The VRCM Settlement Privileged document\/Lack of Response to Allegations Against the Respondent [75] The Group combines two historically related allegations here.\n[76] In my November 22, 2016 Ruling, 2016 CHRT 19, I had ordered the Group to file: \u201cA Chart of specific remedies sought (compensation and reclassification\/conversion) and dollar amount (if available) and time-period claimed, for each of the sixteen members of the Goodwin Group, including which of the three categories of Eligible Work s\/he is claiming under the MOA.\u201d The Group\u2019s counsel at the time, Jean-Rodrigue Yoboua, filed a remedy chart on February 6, 2017. Mr. Goodwin subsequently filed a revised, more detailed one per my request, being the September 2017 Remedy Chart (\u201cSeptember Chart\u201d), in spreadsheet format on September 8, 2017. The September Chart was helpful.\n[77] The allegation is that I improperly viewed a similar document, the October 2017 \u201cwithout prejudice\u201d Settlement document remedy chart (\u201cOctober Chart\u201d), a spreadsheet setting out the amount for each type of compensation claimed for each of the members of the Group for settlement discussion purposes. The October Chart along with other privileged communications between the parties (part of earlier settlement discussions\/negotiations between the Group and Respondent) were intentionally sent to the Tribunal by the Group in May 2018, outlining the Group\u2019s claims that the Respondent and its lead counsel had engaged in \u201csharp practice\u201d, \u201cunethical conduct\u201d, \u201cbad faith\u201d settlement negotiations over the Group\u2019s Eligible Work claim, and an alleged \u201cextortion attempt by ESDC\u201d as against one of the members by threatening to withhold Walden settlement monies. The Group provided documents (settlement proposals and emails with the Respondent, including the allegedly threatening email to Ms. Ladouceur, and the Group\u2019s correspondence with the Ministers of Justice and ESDC and the Law Society of Ontario). The Group requested my intervention \u201cto protect\u201d its members from the Respondent\u2019s and its counsel\u2019s actions and to investigate their actions.\n[78] Respondent counsel opposed my viewing these privileged documents. After reviewing both of the parties\u2019 submissions, I decided to not view said documents, including the October Chart and conveyed this to the parties by Registry letter dated June 29, 2018. My reasons were that the Tribunal does not supervise, nor is a party to, settlement discussions between parties and that my remaining jurisdiction was further limited under the Consent Order to the interpretation and implementation of the MOA, and after the March 31, 2015 deadline, to the remaining matters and motions. If this were a separate complaint of retaliation, for example, under the CHRA, then the aggrieved party would need to file a new complaint with the Commission. (A claim of seven incidents of alleged retaliation (predating the May 2018 ones) by ESDC against the Group for its bringing the Eligible Work motion before the Tribunal was first raised by Mr. Goodwin in a February 2016 CMCC. I advised the parties that the Group would need to file a notice of motion, including addressing the jurisdictional issue. Mr. Goodwin advised on April 26, 2016 that the Group would file a retaliation complaint with the Commission instead.) I did offer the parties the mediation services of a Tribunal member to assist the parties in arriving at a settlement and could address the above issues\/conduct too. The Group, including Ms. Ladouceur, pursued other avenues\/remedies (e.g., to the two Ministers of the Crown and the Law Society of Ontario).\n[79] At this point I had not looked at any of the above documents, including the October Chart. Go forward to the March 11, 2022 CMCC. (At the previous January 21, 2022 CMCC the abeyance was lifted.) To assist the to-be-confirmed new representative, Mr. Brenton, \u201cgetting up to speed\u201d on this voluminous file, the Tribunal offered to make available the entire file as well as the file of the other retired VRCM\u2019s similar Eligible Work motion. The onus, of course, was on Mr. Brenton to go over the contents of the file with the Group and contact the Registry Officer with specific documents requested. (Normally, the former representative is expected to transfer the file to the party\u2019s new representative.) To also assist, the Tribunal undertook to put together a \u201cKey Documents\u201d PDF for the parties. This was not to be exhaustive, but assistive to the parties. The Registry Officer spent considerable time creating this PDF document, with consultation with me as to its contents.\n[80] Unfortunately, the Registry Officer had in good faith included the October Chart by mistake in the Key Documents PDF, instead of the September Chart, and I did not notice the error when I viewed section\/box 9 (Ms. Ladouceur\u2019s claim) of that document in June 2022 in preparation for the June 6, 2022 CMCC dealing with the Agenda issue of the Group to confirm or revise if needed, its remedies. (I had assumed that I was looking at the \u201cwith prejudice\u201d September Chart.) That said, I had only looked at section\/box 9 in the October Chart because I planned to (and indeed did on the CMCC) direct Mr. Brenton to contact Ms. Ladouceur regarding her separate, original Eligible Work motion and whether she wished to transfer any claims from it to her claim as part of the Group.\n[81] The Tribunal and the parties did not notice the inadvertent error. It was not until the Group wrote to the Tribunal on September 27, 2022 inquiring if I had indeed viewed the October Chart and was concerned about the effect, if any, that the Tribunal first learned of the error. (The error was subsequently corrected when the October Chart was removed and replaced with the September Chart in the \u201cKey Documents\u201d PDF by the Registry Officer on my instructions.) The Group\u2019s request\/concern was a fair one. To this day, it remained unanswered. This Ruling is my first response to the inquiry. In retrospect, I should have responded much earlier. My thought-process on September 27, 2022 was that I would put it on the Agenda for the very next CMCC, on October 24, 2022. Indeed, it was placed as item #6 (\u201cRemedy chart; settlement privilege issue\u201d). That CMCC was rescheduled to November 3, 2022. Unfortunately, at that CMCC Mr. Brenton sought an adjournment of the call. He agreed to discuss the Group\u2019s recent \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d and pending motion for recusal and adjournment of the hearing. I set filing deadlines for the motion and then granted his request to adjourn the remainder of the Agenda items (including #6 above) to a subsequent CMCC on November 7, 2022. All parties agreed to attend. However, on Sunday night before the CMCC was to resume the next morning, Mr. Brenton had sent an email to the Tribunal indicating that he would not be participating in the CMCC. So, alas I never got to explain what had occurred regarding the October Chart until now.\n[82] Had that discussion about my seeing the October Chart (specifically, section\/box 9 only) taken place at the CMCC, I would have indicated that there was no prejudice suffered by the parties. Tribunal Members, including myself in the Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion, are entitled to view privileged material, for example, to determine if privilege exists. I did so without objection, for example, in the disclosure motion Ruling 2018 CHRT 20. I note the October Chart is the same one (as part of a package of without prejudice\/privileged documents) that the Group had filed with the Tribunal in May 2018 for me to read, to the objection of the Respondent.\n[83] Regarding these two components of Allegation #3, I find that waiver is not applicable with regards to my inadvertently reading section\/box 9 of the October Chart, as the Group did not have the full picture and was not aware of the Tribunal\u2019s explanation until now. On the merits, I find that this inadvertence on my part does not demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[84] With regards to the factually related allegation of the Tribunal\u2019s lack of response to the request to investigate the settlement conduct of the Respondent and its counsel, I find that the voluntary waiver is applicable. The Group was aware of my response in writing with reasons on June 29, 2018. If the Group thought then that my response was so lacking that it constituted real or perceived bias, the Group was obligated by the longstanding common law principles to bring a motion for recusal based on bias as soon as reasonably possible or at the earliest opportunity, but certainly a lot sooner than November 2022, over four years later. At the very latest, the Group should have raised the bias allegation very soon after it was put on notice of the proper procedure for raising such matters in the Tribunal\u2019s October 4, 2021 letter responding to Mr. Goodwin\u2019s \u201cresignation\u201d letter.\n[85] In the alternative, I find that, on the merits, the Group\u2019s assertion on how I handled its complaint against the Respondent and its counsel does not establish a reasonable apprehension of bias. The reasons that I gave at the time summarized above and found in Tribunal correspondence dated June 29, 2018 were reasonable and free of any bias toward the Group. There is nothing to suggest any bias other than the Group\u2019s disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\nD. Allegation #4: Management of Recent Respondent Deadlines for witness list\/will-says [86] This Allegation by the Group centres around my cancelling the October 24, 2022 \u201cat the last minute\u201d causing \u201cgreat inconvenience\u201d to the members of the Group who planned to attend the CMCC. They contrast my response to an event in July 2018. The October 24, 2022 CMCC was to deal with pre-hearing, case management matters leading up to the November 21, 2022 hearing. Two of the items were the parties\u2019 witness lists and will-says and any changes. The Tribunal had the Group\u2019s final list and will-says; however, the Respondent missed its deadline. I checked my Tribunal email account on Sunday night and Monday morning (October 24th). Not wanting to bifurcate the CMCC, I decided to adjourn the CMCC Sunday night and reschedule once the Respondent had provided its outstanding documents, if by Monday morning the documents still had not arrived.\n[87] I appreciate the inconvenience it caused. However, I wanted the Group and me to have those documents and deal with them and the other Agenda items, on one CMCC, especially given the closeness in time to the upcoming hearing. I acknowledge that I did not seek the position of the parties. It was on short notice (a few hours). Ms. Marchildon wrote in apologizing for missing the deadline and providing an explanation on October 24, 2022. The Tribunal rescheduled the CMCC, but a week later the Group had sent its \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d and then the Group\u2019s focus changed to having me recuse myself and adjourn the November 21, 2022 hearing. I believe that this was the only time in the history of this matter where a CMCC had been cancelled on such short notice.\n[88] In its recusal motion submissions, the Group goes so far as to state: \u201cIn reviewing the sequence of events and e-mails, it seems possible to us that there was off-line communication between the member and the Respondent.\u201d The Tribunal wrote back indicating that there was no ex parte \u201coff-line communication between the Respondent and me.\u201d And the Group writes further: \u201c\u2026it is difficult for us not to conclude that this cancellation had more to do with sparing the Respondent embarrassment regarding her lack of communication around the witness information delays.\u201d That was an odd (and incorrect) conclusion for the Group to draw.\n[89] I note that the only ex parte communication has been on the part of the Group over the course of the proceeding. This has resulted in the Registry Officer having to forward Group correspondence to the other parties on several occasions. The Respondent on more than one occasion has asked me to remind the Group to forward communications with the Tribunal to the other parties, and I have reiterated this, save for minor administrative questions to the Tribunal. (See for example, page 2 of the CMCC summary letter dated March 24, 2016.)\n[90] The Tribunal wrote the parties on October 26, 2022 in part: \u201cThe Tribunal notes that her [Ms. Marchildon\u2019s] extension request came after having missed the October 21, 2022 deadline.\u201d [original italics]. The Group contrasts this to when \u201c\u2026the Member chose to admonish Mr. Goodwin in his letter to all the parties.\u201d This was referencing the Tribunal\u2019s July 20, 2018 letter addressing the Group\u2019s non-compliance with Order #3 of the Ruling, 2018 CHRT 20. The letter read in part: \u201cThe Goodwin [VRCM] Group has failed to comply with the July 13, 2018 deadline set in the Ruling and Order of June 29, 2018. It is trite to say that any requests to vary an order by way of extension or otherwise should be made before any deadline.\u201d The Tribunal\u2019s 2018 response did not include any italicizing or emphasis as it did in the 2022 letter to the parties regarding the Respondent\u2019s missed deadline. I do not agree with the Group\u2019s submission that: \u201cIt\u2019s clear by Member Garfield\u2019s actions in the above 2 examples that there are strict, inflexible rules for [sic] that demand immediate public response to the Complainant even though there is no impact to the parties at all, and different, more flexible rules for the Respondent requiring little or no public response despite a negative impact to the parties.\u201d\n[91] The Tribunal accepted the Respondent\u2019s \u201clate request\u201d for an extension to file her witness information. The Group now submits, \u201cBy accepting a \u2018late\u2019 request for extension, Member Garfield shows favouritism towards one party versus another and without even asking us for our position.\u201d There was no favouritism shown here. I note that over the course of the proceeding that I granted more extension\/deadline requests to the Group than to the Respondent. But that does not suggest anything negative, as one judges each request, motion, objection, etc. on its individual merits. If a party makes ten valid requests\/motions, then it should have all ten granted. It\u2019s not a numbers\u2019 game. A judge\/adjudicator evaluates each one on its merits, on a case-by-case basis.\n[92] I find that waiver is not applicable here as the main event (October 24, 2022 CMCC cancellation) occurred in late October 2022, so the Group\u2019s raising it in its November 1st \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d\/primary submissions for the recusal motion document was reasonable in time. On the merits, I find based on the above, that Allegation #4 does not reach the high level of apprehension of bias.\nE. Allegation #5: Disclosure Requests [93] The Group alleges that I denied the \u201cgreat majority\u201d of their disclosure requests\/motions over the period of 2014-18, showing a pattern of bias against them. One of the highlighted examples was the \u201cCHRT Walden Decision, Overview of Medical Adjudicators CHRT Decisions and Guidelines for Processing Settlement\u201d dated May 2013 (\u201cGuidelines\u201d). The Group had received the Guidelines, redacted and with no Annexes, through an Access to Information and Privacy (\u201cATIP\u201d) request, and not from the Respondent during the disclosure\/production phase of the proceeding. The Group moved for the complete, unredacted document. I allowed their request in part: see Ruling, 2018 CHRT 20. (The issue of the Guidelines, including why it had not been disclosed by the Respondent, was discussed at a 2017 CMCC as outlined in the CMCC summary letter dated October 20, 2017.)\n[94] The Group claims this is an illustration of my bias during the disclosure aspect of the proceeding. The Respondent had opposed this request. At para. 12 of Ruling 2018 CHRT 20, the Tribunal wrote:\nThe Respondent argues lack-of-arguable-relevance for some redactions or non-production of a document in its entirety, and privilege for others. Indeed, Ms. Marchildon questions whether the Guidelines are even arguably relevant, but that it is a moot point in terms of what has been provided to the Respondent already via the ATIP response. The Commission takes the position that certain documents and parts thereof are privileged and that privilege should be \u201cjealously guarded\u201d by the Tribunal. The Goodwin Group argues that the Guidelines with Annexes are arguably relevant and that any claim of privilege has been waived by ESDC when the ATIP request was met.\n[95] In said Ruling I found that the Guidelines were arguably relevant (\u201cor at least parts thereof\u201d) and having determined the issue of privilege, ordered the Respondent to provide the Group the following forthwith: the two emails unredacted to the extent stipulated in this Ruling; and Annex B in its unredacted form. I also ordered one of the letters in question be unsealed and a copy of it and the cover letter provided by the Tribunal Registry to the Group.\n[96] I have reviewed the CMCC summary letters and other Tribunal correspondence, and rulings with reasons provided, regarding the many disclosure requests made by the Group during 2014-18. It is true that the majority of their requests\/motions for disclosure were denied. Each one was determined on its own merits and reasons (oral or written) were provided in all cases. The Group goes even further: \u201cIt is our contention that this Motion could have been resolved years ago had more of our disclosure requests been supported by the Member.\u201d This is of course highly speculative, but misses the point. The Group was successful and not successful in its disclosure (and other) requests based on the merit of each request.\n[97] On the issue of waiver here, I find that it is applicable. In its reply submissions, the Group writes: \u201cAs noted above [regarding disclosure requests denied from 2014-18], soon after raising these concerns with the Tribunal, PSAC assigned us counsel, and counsel did not want to pursue these concerns, preferring to focus on moving to hearing.\u201d The Group does not indicate the date(s) they discussed these issues\/concerns of bias with their counsel, but the Tribunal record indicates Mr. Yoboua represented the Group from September 2016 to May 2017.\n[98] Also, in the above quote the Group states, \u201csoon after raising these concerns with the Tribunal\u2026\u201d I do not know what they mean. My review of the record and my notes do not indicate the Group raised any issues of the Tribunal\u2019s alleged bias before me prior to Mr. Goodwin\u2019s \u201cresignation\u201d email of September 22, 2021. A computer search of the words \u201cbias\u201d and \u201cconflict of interest\u201d reveals that they first appeared as against the Respondent\u2019s client representative and witness as raised by Mr. Goodwin at a 2016 CMCC as reflected in the CMCC summary letter dated March 24, 2016. The first search-result of \u201cbias\u201d as against the Tribunal is found in the Tribunal\u2019s October 4, 2021 letter responding to Mr. Goodwin\u2019s de facto bias-raising \u201cresignation\u201d email of September 22, 2021. A computer file search of the words \u201cbias\u201d and \u201cconflict of interest\u201d reveals the words were first explicitly used by the Group as against the Tribunal in its November 1, 2022 \u201cAppeal to the Chairperson\u201d.\n[99] I agree with the Respondent\u2019s submission that waiver applies here. The Group had discussed their \u201cconcerns\u201d with their counsel sometime in 2016-17. The Group, through its counsel, should have raised the bias matter to the Tribunal then and brought a recusal motion forward. In the alternative, on the merits as discussed above, the Group has not reached the high threshold for establishing apprehension of bias.\nF. Allegation #6: Respondent Not Held Accountable for Withholding Relevant Documents; Incomplete Relevant Documents Provided by the Tribunal\n[100] This Allegation appears to centre on the Tribunal not holding the Respondent accountable for withholding relevant documents in the disclosure phase, and the Tribunal not providing complete documents. The Group focuses on the Guidelines referred to in Allegation #5 above, and the Agreed Statement of Facts in the other retired VRCM\u2019s Eligible Work motion file.\n[101] With respect to the Guidelines issue, I dealt with this in Allegation #5. I did enquire of the Respondent at the CMCC why it was not disclosed. And I adjudicated the matter in 2018 CHRT 20 and made a finding that it was arguably relevant (parts thereof), and made an order for production in part. As for \u201caccountability\u201d, it was open to the Group to cross-examine relevant ESDC witnesses on the point at the hearing, and make legal argument during final submissions, including asking the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences\/findings against the Respondent.\n[102] As for the two Agreed Statements of Facts (\u201cASF\u201d), there had been correspondence among the Registry Officer, Mr. Brenton and Ms. Marchildon regarding one or more ASFs in the other retired VRCM\u2019s matter and attempting to clarify and resolve the issue. I understand that the Tribunal had only received one, unsigned, draft ASF on June 4, 2021. As to why that ASF was not in the Key Documents PDF, the answer is that only the Table of Contents to the Joint Book of Documents (intended exhibits) in the other retired VRCM\u2019s Eligible Work motion file was included. However, my notes indicate that it was on the list to confirm that it was resolved at the October 24, 2022 CMCC, which was cancelled and re-scheduled. As indicated, that and other final case management matters in advance of the November 21, 2022 hearing were never discussed as the Group had by November 1, 2022 gone down the other route of seeking a recusal and adjournment.\n[103] As indicated earlier, the usual practice was for outgoing representatives to pass on the complete file to the successor. (And Mr. Goodwin and Ms. Ladouceur were, along with the other members of the Group, assisting Mr. Brenton.) However, to assist Mr. Brenton we created a Key Documents PDF file given to all the parties. However, Mr. Brenton was told that the onus was on him to contact the Registry Officer regarding any documents he needed (from the Group\u2019s or the other retired VRCM\u2019s files) or to make arrangements to go over the contents of the files. The Registry Officer was very helpful and was in contact with Mr. Brenton by phone and electronically throughout his time as representative. Mr. Brenton had made several requests for documents and received them. That these significant - even extraordinary - efforts might not have been perfect is hardly an argument that the Tribunal was biased.\n[104] As to the question of waiver, I make the same finding of its applicability regarding the Guidelines, as stated in Allegation #5 above. And on the merits, none of the instances enumerated by the Group in Allegation #6, regarding the Guidelines, the ASFs, the Key Documents PDF, etc. come anywhere close to constituting a reasonable apprehension of bias.\nG. Allegation #7: Refusing to Hold a Written Hearing\n[105] The allegation here is that my denial of the Group\u2019s request to have its motion heard in writing as opposed to an oral hearing constitutes a reasonable apprehension of bias.\n[106] The issue was first raised and determined by me at the December 15, 2014 CMCC where the Group was represented by counsel. I heard submissions from the parties. The Respondent opposed the request, not willing to surrender its right to cross-examination. The Commission made no submission on the hearing format. Upon hearing the submissions, I ruled in favour of an oral Eligible Work motion-hearing with reasons orally delivered, and put in written form in the CMCC summary letter. I needed to make findings of fact and law, including regarding controverted facts. Reliability of the evidence also militated in favour of an oral hearing.\n[107] I note that this issue was revisited during the proceeding and I indicated consistently that I was not prepared to take away a party\u2019s right to cross-examination, regarding testimony on the facts and vis-\u00e0-vis the many likely exhibits. (By November 2022, the draft Joint Book of Documents was under 300 intended exhibits.)\n[108] While the Group was always in agreement to a written hearing, the Respondent was not. I did canvass with the parties on several occasions my openness to exploring ways to simplify and speed up the hearing process, including allowing for statements in lieu of direct examination. Having held an oral hearing in the only Eligible Work hearing to have taken place to date, the McIlroy hearing (2015 CHRT 15), I saw the benefit of an oral hearing with cross-examination, and that hearing had fewer witnesses and documents than the Group\u2019s hearing was going to have. That said, had the Respondent, and therefore all the parties waived their right to cross-examination and agreed to a written hearing, I would have done so.\n[109] I find that voluntary waiver applies here. If the Group felt my denial of its request for a written hearing raised issues of bias, it had counsel at that December 2014 CMCC when the ruling was given, and had PSAC counsel later in 2016-17. After that December 2014 CMCC, at the earliest, and when represented by counsel in 2016-17 at the latest, a motion for recusal based on reasonable apprehension of bias could have been brought. In the alternative, on the merits, based on my comments above, I find there is no indicia of apprehension of bias to warrant my recusal.\nH. Allegation #8: Appearance of a Conflict of Interest\n[110] The Group submits that there was a perceived or apparent (not a real or actual) conflict of interest regarding my Tribunal work, including my adjudication of the Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion, and my company\u2019s contract with the federal Government, both involving adjudication as an independent, third-party neutral.\n[111] The Group states that it became aware of this apparent conflict \u201cin the early years\u201d of its motion, in 2016. It did not raise the issue with the Tribunal \u201cfor fear of retaliation were it not taken seriously.\u201d The Group did raise the matter with its then-counsel: \u201cLater in 2016, PSAC [Public Service Alliance of Canada] decided to represent us in our Motion at the CHRT. We provided our PSAC counsel with a copy of Member Garfield\u2019s company federal government contract information from the PWGSC [Public Works and Government Services Canada] website. Counsel did not want to move forward with it.\u201d\n[112] The Respondent counters that there was no conflict of interest, real or apparent, in my adjudicative work:\nIn assessing whether a potential conflict of interest exists and raises a reasonable apprehension of bias, the courts have considered the particular context of the nature of the work an individual may be involved in and the role he\/she may have as a decision-maker. [two cases cited] Tribunal members are often employed in other companies and workplaces and continue to carry out their duties as administrative decision-makers simultaneously.\n\u2026\nThe Eligible Work motion before the Tribunal seeks compensation from ESDC, a completely separate entity from the department identified by the Group\u2026The Tribunal Member\u2019s duties as an adjudicator in human rights complaints are sufficiently removed from any work he may be doing as part of his private sector employment.\nThe Respondent also argues that waiver applies here.\n[113] The contract referred to above was between my Alternative Dispute Resolution Services company and the then-federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (\u201cAANDC\u201d)(Chief Adjudicator\u2019s Office) as one of the many individuals privileged to have been selected to be an Independent Assessment Process (\u201cIAP\u201d) Adjudicator of claims of physical, sexual and psychological abuse by former First Nations students of Indian Residential Schools.\n[114] The IAP system was headed by an independent Chief Adjudicator with Deputy Chief Adjudicators and over 100 Adjudicators across Canada. The IAP system had an administrative\/operational arm, the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat. In essence, the IAP model was akin to an ad hoc, administrative tribunal, like the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, except that the latter is permanent and based on the common law adversarial system, while the IAP was more claimant-centred and inquisitorial. Each is composed of adjudicators and an administrative\/operational agency, and is independent of parties before it, including the Government of Canada.\n[115] I find that waiver applies here. The Group learned of my company\u2019s government contract and told their counsel in 2016. He advised not to proceed and the Group accepted their counsel\u2019s advice. They could have instructed him to proceed to raise the issue and if not satisfied with the Tribunal\u2019s response, bring a motion for recusal. Instead, the Group waited six years to do so. At the very latest, the Group should have brought a motion for recusal after the Tribunal\u2019s October 4, 2021 letter addressing Mr. Goodwin\u2019s de facto accusations of bias and putting the Group on notice of the appropriate procedure and time constraints when making such allegations.\n[116] In the alternative, on the merits, I find that my work from 2011-18 as an independent IAP Adjudicator, through my company\u2019s contract with a separate Government department, and my work as a Tribunal part-time member, including with regards to the Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion, did not constitute a perceived conflict of interest or demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of bias. A reasonably informed person would conclude that my IAP work was independent from my Tribunal work, and vice versa. Most part-time members on this and other tribunals, like me, have other employment and work, including the practice of law. The Government of Canada is a huge entity, composed of many departments and agencies. I was not an employee of AANDC and I did not represent it or the government in my role as an IAP Adjudicator. Similarly, as a part-time member of the Tribunal, I am an independent Governor-in-Council appointee, appointed on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada.\n[117] Both roles are as independent, third-party neutral adjudicators. Both adjudicative roles demand impartiality, fairness and an absence of bias, real or perceived. Indeed, the rigorous selection process for IAP Adjudicators required, among other things, that each Adjudicator-candidate be approved unanimously by the selection panels involving all parties\/stakeholders in the landmark, historic Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement.\n[118] In one of its submissions, the Group states that my conduct has demonstrated a predilection in favour of Government departments and managers. Ironically, approximately ninety percent of my IAP Decisions upheld the claims of the former Residential Schools students against Canada. (This was consistent with the other adjudicators as \u201c90% of all claims that went to a hearing or a Negotiated Settlement Process interview resulted in some level of compensation\u201d: 2021 IAP Summary of the Final Report, IAP Oversight Committee, p. 22). Now of course that does not demonstrate an apprehension of bias in favour of the former students and against Canada, as each IAP case, as with Tribunal cases such as the present one, is judged on a case-by-case basis, after considering the evidence and legal arguments.\n[119] I also find that my company\u2019s IAP contract and my work as an IAP Adjudicator were publicly disclosed. They were no secret. The actual PWGSC contract was posted online (that is how the Group became aware of my IAP work) as was my biography identifying my IAP role in the Tribunal\u2019s Annual Reports (tabled in Parliament) and on the Tribunal website under the Members\u2019 section.\nX. Conclusion\n[120] For the foregoing reasons, I denied the Group\u2019s motion for recusal and adjournment on November 24, 2022. On the following day, the Group withdrew its Eligible Work motion, and I then adjourned the hearing scheduled to begin the following Monday, November 28, 2022. I want to acknowledge the work that the Group and its various representatives had put in over the course of the Eligible Work proceeding; a great deal of time, effort and stress, no doubt. Likewise, for the Respondent counsel and team.\n[121] As I indicated in this Ruling, \u201cbut for\u201d my decision on October 20, 2022 denying the Group\u2019s request to switch to a hybrid (in-person, Zoom) hearing in St. John\u2019s, more likely than not, the process would have unfolded very differently. Instead of the route of the motion for recusal and adjournment, we would have held the hearing in St. John\u2019s and a Decision rendered on the Group\u2019s Eligible Work motion on the merits (\u201cyea\u201d or \u201cnay\u201d). This would have been preferable, but unfortunately, it was not to be.\nSigned by\nMatthew D.

In 2008, Geevarughese Johnson Itty applied to become a border services officer. Mr. Itty is from India originally but had already lived in Canada for 20 years at the time he applied.\nHe passed the screening, and the CBSA accepted him to take part in the training program in Rigaud, Quebec. Recruits are assessed throughout the training program. The CBSA asks recruits to leave the program if their assessors do not pass them. Mr. Itty did not qualify after a series of practice simulations. He had to go home and was not offered a job as a border services officer.\nMr. Itty filed a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal, saying that he had been discriminated against because of his race, colour and national or ethnic origin. He gave the Tribunal many examples of negative things that had happened during the program which he felt were tied to his accent, skin colour or background. Mr. Itty and the CBSA both brought experts to the Tribunal to share information about how the CBSA evaluated Mr. Itty and others. The CBSA also brought evidence that, in the Greater Toronto Area where Mr. Itty would have worked, people with the same background as him were overrepresented. The Tribunal considered all of the evidence and found that there was no link between the negative experiences Mr. Itty had and his protected characteristics.\nMr. Itty also raised an important issue called \u201cspoliation\u201d. He was not able to show the Tribunal the records of his classmates who had passed the course because the CBSA had already destroyed them. This mattered because he thought he had been marked more harshly. Mr. Itty said that the CBSA had done this on purpose to harm his chances in this complaint. The CBSA said they had destroyed the records as they would with any other file. The Tribunal found that the CBSA should have had better policies and coordination when it came to records and human rights complaints. But this did not mean that it met the legal test for spoliation.\nThis decision contained some very sensitive information from the CBSA. The Tribunal ordered this information to be kept confidential. So not all of the details that went into the decision are shared publicly.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

OVERVIEW [1] The Complainant seeks an order anonymizing these proceedings. In her human rights complaint, she states that she is an Indigenous transgender woman in the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada (the Respondent). She alleges that the Respondent\u2019s practice for determining access to gender-affirming care for gender diverse prisoners is discriminatory and in particular that a forensic psychiatrist contracted by the Respondent outed her to her family and home community without her consent.\n[2] She submits that there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of her identity through the Tribunal proceedings would cause her severe and undue hardship, which would engage her personal dignity interests that the broader public has an interest in safeguarding.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission consents to the request. The Respondent takes no position on it.\nII. DECISION [4] For the following reasons, I grant the order.\nIII. ISSUES [5] I must decide the following issues:\nIs there a real and substantial risk that exposing the Complainant\u2019s identity will cause her undue hardship, which poses a serious risk to an important public interest? Are there no alternative measures that would prevent the serious risk of hardship to the Complainant while preserving the values underlying the open court principle? Do the substantial risks of hardship outweigh the public\u2019s interest in knowing the Complainant\u2019s identity?\n[6] The Tribunal\u2019s authority to issue confidentiality orders is set out at s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (CHRA). It states that Tribunal inquiries are conducted in public, which reflects the principle that hearing processes should be held in the open. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25 (CanLII) at para. 1, the open court principle is protected by the constitutionally\u2011entrenched right of freedom of expression and, as such, represents a central feature of a liberal democracy.\n[7] However, the Supreme Court also recognized that exceptional circumstances do arise where competing interests justify a restriction to the open court principle (Sherman Estate at para. 3). In the present context, this is reflected in s. 52(1)(c) of the CHRA, which provides that Tribunal members may take any measures and make any order to ensure the confidentiality of an inquiry if they are satisfied there is a real and substantial risk that the disclosure of personal and other matters will cause undue hardship to the persons involved such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public.\n[8] The statutory analysis for this type of confidentiality order request is informed by the three-part test set out in Sherman Estate, which is generally consistent with the test set out in s. 52(1)(c) of the CHRA (A.B. v. Correctional Service of Canada, 2022 CHRT 15 at paras. 14-15). The Supreme Court stated at para. 38 that the person asking a court or tribunal to exercise its discretion in a way that limits the presumption that hearings are held in open court must establish that:\nCourt openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest; The order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and As a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects.\n[9] The Supreme Court noted that a privacy interest may reflect a public interest in confidentiality (para. 48). However, caution is required in deploying this concept. Open court proceedings by their nature can be a source of discomfort and embarrassment, and these intrusions on privacy are generally seen as of insufficient importance to overcome the presumption of openness (para. 56). It must be demonstrated that the dissemination of highly sensitive information would result in an affront to the affected person\u2019s dignity (paras. 33-35).\n[10] Accordingly, s. 52(1)(c) of the CHRA, informed by the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in Sherman Estate, set outs the issues that I must address in this ruling.\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Issue 1. There is a real and substantial risk that exposing the Complainant\u2019s identity will cause her undue hardship, which poses a serious risk to an important public interest [11] I find that there is a real and substantial risk that exposing the Complainant\u2019s identity will cause her undue hardship, which poses a serious risk to an important public interest.\n[12] The Complainant states in her motion that as an Indigenous transgender woman, she is subject to exceptional and extreme forms of public stigma. She has been referred for gender-affirming surgery and hopes to have the option to live as her chosen gender upon release without being immediately identifiable online as transgender. She adds that if her identity is not anonymized in this proceeding, it will publicly out her in perpetuity, rendering her transgender identity as well as intimate details about her personal history and mental health accessible to anyone at any time. The Complainant attached a copy of the psychiatrist\u2019s report that is the basis of her complaint. It details her mental health history among other personal matters. The Complainant also notes that her anonymity has been maintained throughout her criminal proceedings, which were subject to a publication ban.\n[13] As the Tribunal pointed out in A.B, at paras. 41-42, transgender identity still carries a \u201chigh level of stigma in our society.\u201d The continuing disadvantage, discrimination, extreme stigma, and prejudice experienced by transgender individuals are well known. The Complainant points out that she is in an even more vulnerable situation due to her intersectional status as an Indigenous transgender person detained in a correctional facility.\n[14] I find that, just as in the case of the transgendered complainant in A.B., the Complainant\u2019s transgendered identity falls within the protected privacy interests identified in Sherman Estate. It is information so sensitive that its dissemination could be an affront to the Complainant\u2019s dignity. She would face a real and substantial risk of undue hardship that is far more than a mere embarrassment or discomfort. It would be an affront to her dignity.\nB. Issue 2. An anonymization order is necessary; no alternative measures would prevent the serious risk of hardship to the Complainant while preserving the values underlying the open court principle [15] The Complainant has established that there are no measures short of an anonymization order which would be sufficient to protect her personal dignity and privacy interests with respect to her gender identity.\n[16] The complaint is centred on the psychiatrist\u2019s report. The substantive content of this report cannot be redacted without undermining the transparency and intelligibility of the Tribunal\u2019s ultimate ruling. A blanket publication ban, or even the limited redaction of the more intimate substantive details concerning the Complainant\u2019s gender, mental health, or personal history, would significantly undermine the public\u2019s ability to understand the case and the Tribunal\u2019s decision. The only reasonable option is to redact the Complainant\u2019s name and identifying information from the report and other documents to protect her anonymity in these proceedings.\n[17] As the Complainant correctly submits, the requested order\u2019s terms will not undermine the public\u2019s ability to understand the issues at stake in this matter or the basis for the Tribunal\u2019s decision. All the underlying facts will remain part of the record and can be included in the Tribunal\u2019s decision, save those limited details specifically identifying the Complainant. The values underlying the open court principle would thus be preserved.\nC. Issue 3. The substantial risks of hardship outweigh the societal interest in knowing the Complainant\u2019s identity; the benefits of the order outweigh any harms [18] The risks of hardship to the Complainant outweigh the societal interest in her identity. In fact, there is an important public interest in safeguarding her dignity and that of other potential transgender complainants who may be in similar circumstances as her. The public interest in her identity is limited, especially given that her criminal proceedings to date have also been anonymized.\n[19] As the Complainant correctly points out, the order being sought strikes the perfect balance by removing only her identifying information (i.e., the Complainant\u2019s gender identity, her personal, medical, and mental health histories, and the tone and findings of the psychiatrist\u2019s report) from public view, while leaving intact all evidence and information that may actually be relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision. This approach respects the core values underlying the open court principle while also preserving the public\u2019s interest in protecting the privacy, safety, and human dignity of transgender human rights complainants. The benefits of such an order outweigh its negative effects.\n[20] I therefore find that the three parts of the test have been met and that, in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s authority under s. 52(1) of the CHRA, a confidentiality order should be granted with the conditions set out below.\nV. ORDER [21] The Tribunal orders the following:\nThe Complainant must be referred to as E.F. throughout these proceedings, including in motions, submissions (both written and oral), hearings, rulings and decisions, and any other documents filed in the Tribunal\u2019s official record of these proceedings; The Complainants\u2019 identifying information, including her preferred name, her \u201cdead name\u201d (i.e., the name given at birth), the names of her family members, and her date of birth (collectively referred to as \u201cIdentifying Information\u201d), will be kept confidential throughout these proceedings, including in motions, submissions (both written and oral), hearings, rulings and decisions, and any other documents filed in the Tribunal\u2019s official record of these proceedings; The Complainant\u2019s Identifying Information will not be disclosed to anyone except the Tribunal, Tribunal Secretariat personnel, members of the parties\u2019 litigation teams, their clients in this matter, and prospective or actual witnesses; The Registry is instructed to identify any Identifying Information filed in the official records of this proceeding. Such information is to be redacted from any public access request for the documents that contain it; and The parties will apply appropriate redactions before filing any documents with the Tribunal.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nApril 3, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nFile No. : HR-DP-2856-22\nStyle of Cause:\nE.F. v.

ORDER 7\nI. OVERVIEW [1] On February 23, 2023, Air-Canada filed a motion with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) requesting amongst other demands that 1) allegations regarding discrimination on the basis of \u201csex\u201d be struck out of the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars as a prohibited ground of discrimination and 2) the time period of the alleged incidents be 2014-2018.\n[2] On March 17, 2023, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) filed its arguments on Air Canada\u2019s motion stating that the discrimination on the basis of sex is properly within the scope of the complaint. In its written arguments, the Commission is silent on the issue of the time period of the alleged incidents.\n[3] Ms Sabrina Rizzo (the Complainant) has not provided written arguments on Air Canada\u2019s motion or the Commission\u2019s arguments.\nII. DECISION [4] The Tribunal grants in part Air Canada\u2019s motion and declares 1) that \u201csex\u201d is not a discrimination ground included in the complaint; 2) that paragraphs 7 and 10 of Ms. Rizzo\u2019s Statement of Particulars are not to be struck out; and 3) that the time period of the alleged discriminatory incidents in the proceeding is restricted to the period from 2014 to 2018.\nIII. ISSUES [5] This ruling determines two issues:\nA)Does the Tribunal have the jurisdiction to determine the scope of the complaint?\nB)If so, are the limits requested by Air Canada justified?\nIV. Analysis A. Does the Tribunal have the jurisdiction to determine the scope of the complaint? [6] For the following reasons, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction to determine the scope of the complaint.\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6. (the Act or CHRA) gives the Tribunal member hearing a matter under inquiry the power to decide all questions of law or fact necessary to determining the matter (CHRA, section 50(2). The member must give the parties full and ample opportunity to present evidence and make representations (CHRA, section 50(1).\n[8] In Prassad (Prassad v. Canada (Ministry of Employment and Immigration), 1989 CanLII 131 (CSC), [1989] 1 SCR 560) the Supreme Court of Canada stated that as a general rule, administrative tribunals are considered to be \u201cmasters in their own house\u201d. The Supreme Court adds that \u201cIn the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice.\u201d\n[9] The case law states that the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to amend, clarify or determine the scope of the original discrimination complaint (Casler v. Canadian National Railway, 2017 CHRT 6, paras. 7-11) [Casler]; provided that no prejudice is caused to the other parties (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Telephone Employees Assn., 2002 FCT 776, paras. 30 et 31) [Canadian Telephone Employees Assn.]). As part of the authority to determine the scope of the complaint, the Tribunal has the power to strike portions of a Statement of Particulars that exceed the scope of the complaint (Canada (Attorney General v. First nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, 2021 FC 969 at para. 154). In the present case, neither the Commission nor Ms. Rizzo has challenged this power of the Tribunal.\n[10] For these reasons, in accordance with the Act and considering the case law, the Tribunal concludes that it has the jurisdiction to determine the scope of the complaint.\nB. If so, are the limits requested by Air Canada justified? (i) Is sex a ground of discrimination to be considered by the Tribunal? [11] The Tribunal is of the opinion that \u201csex\u201d is not part of the complaint and therefore is not a ground of discrimination that should be analysed through the proceedings.\n[12] As noted above, the Tribunal has the power, in certain circumstances, to define and therefore limit the scope of allegations.\n[13] Moreover, the inquiry into the case may not deal with a new complaint that the Commission has not considered since, under the Act (section 44(3) and section 49), a request to the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into a complaint may be made only if the Commission has considered the complaint (CHRA, subsection 44(3) and section 49). Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada in Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, para. 48 states that the Act sets out a complete mechanism for dealing with complaints and that the Commission is central to that mechanism.\n[14] Note that, in Dillman (IMP Group Limited v. Dillman (1995), 24 C.H.R.R. D\/329) the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal criticizes the administrative tribunal established under Nova Scotia\u2019s Human Rights Act (Human Rights Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, c. 214) for allowing an amendment that extended the facts of the original complaint to the point where it constituted a new complaint that the Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission had not considered, as required under the Human Rights Act. The original complaint was related to harassment by a co-worker, while the amendment was related to the employer\u2019s refusal to give the complainant a promotion. The events referred to in the amendment had not been considered by the Human Rights Commission; therefore, the process set out in the legislation had been bypassed. The Court of Appeal found that the proposed amendment constituted a new complaint that had not been referred to the administrative tribunal by the Human Rights Commission, contrary to the requirements of the Human Rights Act. The original complaint and the subsequent amendment were in essence two different complaints. For these reasons, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal allowed the appeal.\n[15] These principles have also been articulated in well-established case law including by the Tribunal and the Federal Court in Casler and in Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation v. Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396), 2006 FC 704. The scope of the dispute before the Tribunal may not introduce a new complaint that has not already been considered by the Commission and that does not respect the Commission\u2019s request to institute an inquiry. The Tribunal therefore does not have the power to deal with a complaint that has not been dealt with first by the Commission and that has not been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry (see Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 12) [Cook]). It is therefore necessary to confine oneself to the complaint and the Commission\u2019s decisions with respect to the complaint, in particular the request for inquiry that the Commission has made to the Tribunal.\n[16] The concept of a complaint is nevertheless broad enough to be interpreted in a way that encompasses the full extent of the complainant\u2019s allegations (Cook, para. 11). A complaint is the first step in the process and it is inevitable that new facts and circumstances will come to light in the course of the Commission\u2019s investigation (Casler). The complaint is refined and clarified as the process moves forward (Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1, para. 11) [Gaucher]). However, a limit is necessary when the amendment to a complaint can no longer be considered a simple amendment but is instead more like a new complaint (Gaucher). Likewise, upon reading the complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, the allegations of facts to be analyzed by the Tribunal for purposes of determining the dispute must somehow emanate from or arise out of the complaint itself but must not depart from it in such a way as to constitute a new complaint.\n[17] The Tribunal considers that the prohibited ground of discrimination raised by a complainant is part of their theory of the case. The theory is their own. The complainant may choose to include or not to include a ground of discrimination, just as they may raise one argument or another to justify the findings they are seeking, as long as they respect the substance of the original complaint (Casler; Canadian Telephone Employees Assn.).\n[18] In her complaint filed December 18, 2018, Ms. Rizzo identifies disability as the prohibited ground of discrimination and she describes events in relation to this ground of discrimination. She specifically writes \u201cI am filing a complaint on the grounds that I have two disabilities and the action taken by Air Canada was to terminate my employment pending discharge July 20, 2017\u201d \u2026 \u201cI was discriminated more then once and for more than one illness\u201d. She specifies that her disabilities consist of a brain disease and a mental illness. The discriminatory events that she describes in her complaint are comments, decisions (including the termination of her employment) and the lack of accommodation from her employer all in relation with her disabilities.\n[19] In her complaint, there is no reference, not even an implicit reference, to any alleged discriminatory comment or event or decision from her employer based on the fact that she is a woman. There is no allegation related to discrimination on the basis of sex. Therefore, \u201csex\u201d was not a ground of discrimination, not even in an implicit way in Ms. Rizzo\u2019s complaint.\n[20] Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that \u201csex\u201d is not a ground of discrimination to be considered in the present proceedings.\n(ii) Should some paragraphs of her Statement of Particulars be modified or struck out? [21] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the Statement of Particulars should remain as is.\n[22] As seen earlier, as part of the authority to determine the scope of the complaint, the Tribunal has the power to strike portions of a Statement of Particulars that exceed the scope of the complaint (Canada (Attorney General) v. First nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, 2021 FC 969 at para. 154). However, the Tribunal must exercise its authority \u201ccautiously\u201d and only in the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d (Richards v. Correctional Service Canada, 2020 CHRT 27 at para. 86).\n[23] Air Canada is asking the Tribunal to refuse to consider allegations related to discrimination on the basis of sex. It asks the Tribunal not to consider allegations made in paragraphs 7 and 10 of Mrs. Rizzo\u2019s Statement of Particulars filed in January 2023.\n[24] In paragraph 7, 10, 11 and 12 Ms. Rizzo states as follows:\n7. MAY 2015 in the meeting with steve and donato ac manager, they told me that since \u201cyou are a woman and most women tend to react more with hysteria to situations\u201d . \u201cmen react differently\u201d according to ac managers.\n10. The very same night, May 2015 I called Steve and donato that I felt there report was \u201cBIASED\u201d as you can not investigate yourself and arrive at fair conclusion, you cannot tell me I imagined it and it is very wrong to tell me \u201creacted with hysteria because I was a woman\u201d. And you took away my right to union representation at this meeting.\n11. The very next day, the manager called me and told me that I was \u201cHeld out of service because I needed to be medically examined\u201d His name was Basil hardtman.\n12. I called my manager a few days later, her name is Mona Begum, and asked why I was held out of service and she said \u201cI must have a severe psychological disorder to have said the word BIAS\u201d\n[25] While one could infer from paragraphs 7 and 10 that Ms. Rizzo is adding \u201csex\u201d as a new ground of discrimination not sought in her initial complaint, the Tribunal is not convinced that it is the case and that paragraphs 7 and 10 have to be struck out.\n[26] The Tribunal is of the opinion that considering the context of the complaint and the Statement of Particulars, it is not clear that this is what Ms. Rizzo is doing. One cannot isolate paragraphs 7 and 10 from the context of the complete Statement of Particulars, especially paragraphs 11 and 12 adjacent to paragraphs 7 and 10. It seems that Ms. Rizzo is stating conversations that happened with Air Canada\u2019s managers to prove that these people discriminated against her because of her disability.\n[27] Ms. Rizzo did not file an argument following Air Canada\u2019s motion or the Commission\u2019s arguments. The Tribunal cannot conclude that paragraphs 7 and 10 add \u201csex\u201d as a new ground of discrimination.\n[28] Therefore paragraphs 7 and 10 of the Statement of particulars will be considered as allegations relating to events in relation with disability as a ground of discrimination. They are not to be struck out.\n(iii) What is the time period of the alleged incidents of discrimination? [29] Air Canada requests direction from the Tribunal confirming that the time period in consideration in this proceeding is 2014 to 2018. Air Canada contests the time period identified in paragraph 40 of Ms. Rizzo\u2019s Statement of Particulars that reads as follows: \u201cI was disciplined, targeted, bullied and psycholocially abused by Air Canada from 2014-2023.\u201d\n[30] The Commission did not make any representations on the request by Air Canada to restrict the inquiry to the period between 2014 to 2018. As noted above, Ms. Rizzo did not file any argument on Air Canada\u2019s motion.\n[31] On February 15, 2022, in its referral letter to the Tribunal, the Commission stated: \u201cThe Commission decided, pursuant to subparagraph 44(3)(a)(i) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that you institute an inquiry into the allegations in the Complaint between 2014 and 2018, as it is satisfied that, having regard to all circumstances, an inquiry is warranted\u201d.\n[32] As the Commission requested that the Tribunal institute an inquiry into allegations of discrimination for the period of 2014 to 2018, and in the absence of any arguments to the contrary from the Complainant or the Commission, the Tribunal concludes that the period for its inquiry is between 2014 and 2018.\nV. ORDER [33] The Tribunal grants in part Air Canada\u2019s motion and concludes that:\nthe prohibited ground of discrimination raised by the complaint is disability; sex is not a ground of discrimination in the proceedings; paragraphs 7 and 10 of Mrs. Rizzo\u2019s Statement of Particulars are not to be struck out; the time period of the alleged incidents of discrimination is from 2014 to 2018.\nSigned by\nMarie Langlois\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMay 4, 2022\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: HR-DP-2788-22\nStyle of Cause: Sabrina Rizzo v.

OVERVIEW [1] The Respondent, the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) (RCMP), requests that the entire Statement of Particulars (SOP) of the Complainant, Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz (Mr. Campos-Ruiz), be struck. The RCMP claims that all the SOP\u2019s allegations relate to parts of the human rights complaint that the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) never referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) for inquiry. The Commission agrees that the SOP\u2019s allegations relate solely to matters not referred to the Tribunal but submits that Mr. Campos-Ruiz should be allowed to provide further and better particulars.\n[2] Mr. Campos-Ruiz objects to the RCMP\u2019s motion, arguing that all the complaint\u2019s allegations are before the Tribunal and that he is entitled to address them in his SOP.\nII. DECISION [3] For the following reasons, I grant the RCMP\u2019s request to strike all the SOP\u2019s allegations but allow Mr. Campos-Ruiz to file a new SOP.\nIII. ISSUES [4] I must decide the following issues:\nWhich parts of the complaint did the Commission ask the Tribunal to inquire into? Does the SOP address those parts of the complaint? If not, should the entire SOP be struck? If so, should Mr. Campos-Ruiz be permitted to file a new SOP to deal with the parts of the complaint that were referred to the Tribunal?\nIV. ANALYSIS 1. Only the RCMP\u2019s Residency Policy was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry [5] Mr. Campos-Ruiz filed his complaint in August 2019. At the time, he had been a member of the RCMP for 11 years. His spouse, Briana Campos-Ruiz (Ms. Campos-Ruiz), was also an RCMP member, and they were both employed in British Columbia. Ms. Campos-Ruiz had taken a medical leave from her employment, and her physicians had recommended that she be closer to her family in Saskatchewan for support in her recovery. Mr. Campos-Ruiz therefore requested a transfer to the RCMP\u2019s F Division (Saskatchewan).\n[6] In his complaint, he states that he was told the transfer would not be granted as long as his spouse was unable to return to work in full capacity or until she left the RCMP altogether. He thus submits that he was treated differently because he was married, a discriminatory practice based on the grounds of family and marital status (the Transfer Denial Allegation).\n[7] Mr. Campos-Ruiz contends that faced with the RCMP\u2019s refusal to transfer him, his spouse was \u201cforced\u201d to take her medical pension several months after the refusal and to be discharged from the RCMP to eliminate the obstacle to his transfer. Shortly thereafter, he received the paperwork approving his transfer to F Division. Four detachment options were offered to him, including three that were 30-45 minutes from Regina, Saskatchewan, which is where his spouse had established herself to be close to her family. She had also set up a new business there, unrelated to policing, as a form of therapy encouraged by her physicians.\n[8] Mr. Campos-Ruiz claims that, when he received his transfer documents, he learned for the first time that F Division has a policy requiring members to live within 40 km of the detachment area (Residency Policy). None of the detachment options that were offered to him were within this distance from Regina, and he could therefore not reside there and be employed even at the nearest of those options, in Milestone, Saskatchewan. His complaint appears to allege that the enforcement of this policy in his circumstances constitutes a discriminatory practice on the grounds of marital and family status.\n[9] According to the SOP, Mr. Campos-Ruiz took stress leave around the time he filed his human rights complaint and retired from the RCMP in May 2020.\n[10] The Commission investigated the complaint and on October 6, 2021, issued the following decision that only the Residency Policy portion of the complaint be dealt with:\nDECISION OF THE COMMISSION\nBefore rendering its decision, the Commission reviewed the Complaint Form and the Report for Decision. After examining this information, the Commission decides:\nwith respect to the allegation that the Complainant was denied a transfer opportunity because his wife was on medical leave, not to deal with this aspect of the complaint because it is vexatious pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the Canadian Human Rights Act; and,\nwith respect to the allegation concerning the application of the Residency Policy, to deal with this aspect of the complaint pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\nThe Commission also decides, pursuant to subparagraph 44(3)(a)(i) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, to request that the Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal institute an inquiry into the allegation concerning the application of the Residency Policy, because having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry is warranted.\n[11] On October 7, 2021, the Commission wrote to the Chairperson of the Tribunal to request that pursuant to s. 44(3)(a)(i) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (Act), an inquiry be instituted into the \u201callegation concerning the application of the Residency Policy as [the Commission] is satisfied that, having regard all the circumstances, an inquiry is warranted.\u201d\n[12] The Tribunal's jurisdiction to conduct inquiries into complaints is derived from s. 49 of the Act, according to which the Tribunal Chairperson must institute an inquiry into a complaint upon receipt of a request from the Commission (s. 49(2)). The scope of Tribunal inquiries is thus limited to the matters arising from the complaints accompanying such requests (see Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22 (CanLII) at para 7).\n[13] In the present case, the Commission exercised its authority under the Act and specifically decided not to deal with the Transfer Denial Allegation in the complaint. The scope of the Tribunal inquiry is thus limited to the Residency Policy.\n[14] Mr. Campos-Ruiz submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction nonetheless to deal with the Transfer Denial Allegation because doing so would enable a full and proper hearing into the totality of his circumstances. He contends that his \u201cforced resignation\u201d was due to a combination of the Residency Policy and the denial of the transfer, and one cannot be parsed from the other. He asserts that this combined issue was \u201cclearly referred to the Tribunal by the Commission.\u201d\n[15] In fact, it is quite the opposite. The Commission could not have been any more explicit in its decision when it ruled that it would not deal with \u201cthe allegation that the Complainant was denied a transfer opportunity because his wife was on medical leave.\u201d\n[16] Consequently, the Tribunal is only seized with the part of the complaint dealing with the Residency Policy.\n2. The SOP does not address the RCMP\u2019s Residency Policy [17] The facts and issues dealt with in the SOP only address the Transfer Denial Allegation, an observation that the Commission describes as \u201cobvious\u201d in its submissions on the motion.\n[18] Mr. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s SOP details the facts of his case in 14 paragraphs under the heading \u201cFacts in support.\u201d The first five set out uncontroversial background facts such as the dates when he joined the RCMP and when his spouse went on off-duty sick leave. Paragraphs 6 to 9 refer exclusively to the difficulties he had obtaining a transfer and how the denial was connected to his spouse\u2019s situation.\n[19] In paragraph 10, Mr. Campos-Ruiz states that he took a stress leave in August 2019 and then resigned in May 2020, which he links to the RCMP\u2019s conduct. These facts were not mentioned in the complaint as they occurred after it was filed.\n[20] In paragraphs 11 to 13, Mr. Campos-Ruiz details the income and benefits he has lost as a result of his having been \u201ccompelled to resign\u201d from the RCMP.\n[21] He concludes at paragraph 14 that he was placed in the position of having to choose between his job and the needs of his family as a consequence of the RCMP\u2019s discriminatory conduct.\n[22] In his outline of issues to be dealt with in the complaint, Mr. Campos-Ruiz states that he was discriminated against based on his family status and lists as the sole discriminatory practice the RCMP\u2019s requirement that his spouse resign as a prerequisite to approving, or even considering, his request for a transfer. In other words, the Transfer Denial Allegation.\n[23] The rest of his SOP consists of a breakdown of the orders he is seeking as remedy and a list of his proposed witnesses. He also includes a list of relevant documents that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137, (Rules of Procedure) require.\n[24] The Residency Policy is not mentioned at all. The Transfer Denial Allegation is the sole allegation outlined in Mr. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s SOP.\n3. The entire SOP must be struck [25] In its motion, the RCMP highlights the importance of particulars to a fair hearing process. Principles of natural justice dictate that a party must be aware of the case it must meet at the hearing. The purpose of requiring parties to prepare SOPs is to sufficiently describe to the other parties the details of the allegations and the factual matters intended to be proven at a hearing. If a respondent is not provided with sufficient details in the SOP, then it will be impossible for them to interview potential witnesses or to source the arguably relevant documentation (Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2018 CHRT 2 at para. 34 (CanLII)).\n[26] Mr. Campos-Ruiz gives no details in his SOP about the one matter that the Commission referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, the Residency Policy. The particulars either refer to general background information or the Transfer Denial Allegation. They are therefore outside the scope of the portions of the complaint that are before the Tribunal.\n[27] The Tribunal has the authority to strike particulars in an SOP that do not fall within the scope of the complaint that the Commission referred to it for inquiry (Levasseur v. Canada Post Corporation, 2021 CHRT 32 at para. 7).\n[28] Mr. Campos-Ruiz submits that the Tribunal should refuse to do so in this case and that it should exercise its \u201cjurisdiction\u201d to include the Transfer Denial Allegation as part of the hearing of his matter because it would enable a full and proper hearing of the totality of his circumstances. He argues that the RCMP has only raised \u201ctechnical objections\u201d, which can be dealt with at the hearing, and that it has not demonstrated how it would be prejudiced if its motion is denied. He refers to decisions holding that respondents must show that they will experience actual prejudice (Karas v. Canadian Blood Services, 2020 CHRT 12 (CanLII); Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies v. Correctional Service of Canada, 2022 CHRT 12 (CanLII) (Elizabeth Fry).\n[29] These decisions are taken out of context. In Karas, the Tribunal looked at whether to deal with complaints against two separate respondents in a single inquiry. It was not about the scope of the complaints or whether to strike allegations. In Elizabeth Fry, the issue was whether the Tribunal would permit the Commission and the complainant to amend or \u201cupdate\u201d their SOPs. The Tribunal pointed out, at para. 14, that amendments are allowed if they are linked to the original complaint and do not cause prejudice to other parties. But an amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint as this would bypass the Commission referral process dictated by the Act.\n[30] This last point is relevant to the present case. Mr. Campos-Ruiz has filed an SOP that does not deal with the single matter that the Commission referred to the Tribunal\u2014the Residency Policy. If the Tribunal exercised the \u201cjurisdiction\u201d that he claims it possesses to deal with the Transfer Denial Allegation, the Tribunal would effectively be introducing a new complaint to the process. The Tribunal does not have the authority to introduce a new complaint. It is not just a \u201ctechnical\u201d issue. Whether the RCMP would be prejudiced with the reintroduction of the allegation is irrelevant. The Commission decided not to request an inquiry into it and if Mr. Campos-Ruiz was not satisfied with this decision, he could have asked the Federal Court of Canada to judicially review it. He apparently did not.\n[31] Mr. Campos-Ruiz submits that the application of the Residency Policy is merely an evidentiary issue as it was just one of the methods used by the RCMP to deny him accommodation. Parties are not required to provide every detail of their case in an SOP, only the material facts.\n[32] This is a misrepresentation of the issue that the RCMP is raising. The Residency Policy was the only portion of the complaint that the Commission referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. It is not just a piece of evidence in support of the case before me. It is the entire case. Yet the SOP makes absolutely no mention of it. In the absence of any reference to the Residency Policy, the SOP in its current form has basically no connection to the complaint before the Tribunal.\n[33] Mr. Campos-Ruiz argues that his spouse\u2019s circumstances are integral to understanding the matter before the Tribunal. She has filed her own complaint against the RCMP, and it has been referred to the Tribunal as well. He suggests that both complaints should be joined, a question that was also raised at the Case Management Conference Call held on February 8, 2023. I directed that the RCMP\u2019s motion to strike would be dealt with first and that we would deal with the joinder of the two complaints afterwards.\n[34] Thus, the question of joining the two complaints and providing the necessary context remains a possibility. But the fact that two complaints may be joined for the purposes of hearing does not allow the Tribunal to assume jurisdiction over a portion of a complaint that the Commission did not refer for inquiry.\n[35] Information that provides context can be important to a case and perhaps some of the information mentioned in the current SOP may serve that purpose. But the fact remains that there is absolutely no mention in the SOP of the single issue that was referred for inquiry, the Residency Policy. As I direct later in this ruling, Mr. Campos-Ruiz will be able to file another SOP. He may choose to incorporate some facts that provide the context he wants to present, but they must be centred and related to the one matter that is before the Tribunal, the Residency Policy.\n[36] Since the particulars do not address the Residency Policy at all, the SOP must be struck.\n4. The Complainant may file a new SOP to deal with the Residency Policy [37] In his submissions, Mr. Campos-Ruiz requested in the alternative that if his particulars are struck, he be given the opportunity to amend them. In a similar vein, the Commission suggested that rather than striking the whole SOP, the Tribunal should order him to provide further and better particulars dealing with the Residency Policy allegation.\n[38] Mr. Campos-Ruiz points to instances where the Tribunal has allowed parties to amend their SOPs. However, as mentioned earlier, amendments are allowed where they add to the existing particulars and allegations but still relate to the original complaint.\n[39] In this case, the existing particulars in their current form do not make any mention of the matter in the complaint that was referred for inquiry. We cannot speak of \u201cfurther and better particulars\u201d since the Residency Policy allegation was not dealt with at all in the SOP.\n[40] The more appropriate and fair approach is to give Mr. Campos-Ruiz the opportunity to \u201cstart from scratch,\u201d so to speak, by striking the existing SOP and enabling him to file his SOP anew, taking into account my findings in this ruling.\nV. ORDER [41] For the above reasons, the Tribunal grants the RCMP\u2019s motion. The particulars in Mr. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s SOP under the headings A) Facts in support, B) Issues for complaint, and C) Orders sought are struck.\n[42] Mr. Campos-Ruiz may provide and file a new SOP by June 2, 2023.\n[43] The RCMP will provide and file its SOP and the related disclosure in accordance with Rule 20 of the Rules of Procedure by June 23, 2023.\n[44] Mr. Campos-Ruiz may file his reply to the RCMP\u2019s SOP by June 30, 2023.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, ON\nMay 12, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nFile No. : T2739\/11521\nStyle of Cause: Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz v.

ORDER 7\nI. OVERVIEW [1] The Respondent, the Attorney General of Canada (representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) (RCMP), requests that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal) exercise its discretion to strike out several paragraphs from the Statement of Particulars (SOP) of the Complainant, Briana Campos-Ruiz (Ms. Campos-Ruiz). The RCMP claims that those paragraphs seek to unnecessarily expand the scope of the inquiry as set out in the complaint that the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) referred to the Tribunal.\n[2] Ms. Campos-Ruiz objects to the motion, arguing that the claims in those paragraphs (the Contested Claims) explain the full story of her treatment by the RCMP and complete the complaint. She requests that the complaint be amended to include the Contested Claims.\n[3] The Contested Claims are identified in a list attached to this ruling as Appendix A.\nII. DECISION [4] For the following reasons, I deny the RCMP\u2019s motion and grant Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s request to amend her complaint.\nIII. ISSUE [5] The Contested Claims refer to incidents that occurred after the complaint was filed and that were obviously not included in the original complaint.\n[6] I must therefore decide the following issue:\nShould the Contested Claims be struck, or alternatively should Ms. Campos-Ruiz be allowed to amend the complaint to include them?\nIV. THE CONTENT OF THE CONTESTED CLAIMS [7] Ms. Campos-Ruiz filed her complaint in February 2018. At the time, she was a 16-year member of the RCMP serving in Langley, British Columbia, but had been on medical leave since April 2016, having been diagnosed with an illness. She claims that she was discriminated against and harassed throughout her medical leave on the grounds of disability. The Commission\u2019s \u201cSummary of Complaint\u201d sheet at the front of the complaint states that the provision of the Canadian Human Rights Act RSC 1985, c. H-6 (Act) at issue is s. 7, which addresses discriminatory practices in the course of employment. The \u201cComplainant\u2019s Story\u201d portion of the complaint refers to s. 10 (discriminatory policy or practice) and s. 14 (harassment) of the Act as well.\n[8] The complaint details several instances of discrimination and harassment that Ms. Campos-Ruiz claims to have experienced. The first relates to what she describes as the RCMP\u2019s unjustified refusal to approve her secondary employment. Her medical treatment provider advised her to open a small home-based business to give her some structure and \u201ca reason to get out of bed in the morning,\u201d which would help in her recovery. She completed a course and became certified in a field unrelated to policing. She applied to the RCMP for approval of her secondary employment, having been previously told that the process was simple and not likely to be denied. She opened her new business and saw improvement in her health. However, several months later, in October 2016, she learned that her approval request had been denied because management had concerns about her working elsewhere while being \u201coff-duty sick,\u201d the term for sick leave in the RCMP.\n[9] In her complaint, Ms. Campos-Ruiz claims that she was also discriminated against and harassed when, in June 2017, the RCMP opened an investigation against her, alleging that she breached the RCMP\u2019s Code of Conduct by engaging in secondary employment and leaving her duty area without authorization. These actions affected her health, which she claims was worsened by several RCMP representatives\u2019 repeated calls to her in the following months, which she interpreted as veiled threats and harassment.\n[10] The original complaint does not contain any other examples of discrimination and harassment.\n[11] However, Ms. Campos-Ruiz contends that the discrimination and harassment continued after she filed the human rights complaint with the Commission. These subsequent events are described in the Contested Claims.\n[12] In April 2018, she was medically cleared to return to service with the RCMP, provided certain accommodation measures were taken. She claims that the RCMP neglected or refused to adopt these measures and, as a result, she had to remain on sick leave, which further negatively affected her health.\n[13] In July 2018, she applied to the RCMP again for approval of her secondary employment but was denied the following month. She states that her medical treatment providers recommended she relocate to Saskatchewan where she would have family support.\n[14] Her spouse, Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz (Mr. Campos-Ruiz) is also an RCMP member working in British Columbia. He asked for a transfer to Saskatchewan to accompany her but was told it would not be approved as long as Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s situation remained \u201cunresolved.\u201d She maintains that the only way for her to \u201cresolve\u201d the situation, given the RCMP\u2019s unwillingness to accommodate her, was to resign from the RCMP, which she effectively did by accepting a medical retirement in April 2019. After she retired, the RCMP approved her spouse\u2019s transfer to Saskatchewan.\n[15] The Contested Claims include a request to be compensated for the loss of employment and pension income that she would have earned had she not retired from the RCMP in April 2019.\n[16] In addition to disability, the Contested Claims allege discrimination based on family status. Ms. Campos-Ruiz contends that the RCMP discriminated against her in breach of s. 7 of the Act by forcing her to resign as a prerequisite to approving or even considering her spouse\u2019s request to be transferred to Saskatchewan. She also alleges that the RCMP failed to reasonably accommodate her return to work.\nV. ANALYSIS The Contested Claims should not be struck, and Ms. Campos-Ruiz may amend her complaint\n[17] The RCMP contends that the Tribunal cannot inquire into the Contested Claims. It points out that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct inquiries into complaints is derived from s. 49 of the Act, according to which the Tribunal Chairperson must institute an inquiry into a complaint upon receipt of a request from the Commission (s. 49(2)). The scope of Tribunal inquiries is thus limited to the matters arising from the complaints accompanying such requests (see Kowalski v. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 CHRT 22 (CanLII) at para. 7). The RCMP argues that since Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s complaint did not mention any of the Contested Claims, the Tribunal has no authority to deal with them and they should be struck from her SOP.\n[18] Ms. Campos-Ruiz counters that she should be allowed to amend her complaint to include the Contested Claims.\n[19] As noted in Blodgett v. GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc, 2013 CHRT 24, at paras 16-17, s. 48.9(2) of the Act gives the Tribunal considerable discretion in the conduct of its proceedings. This includes granting or dismissing motions to amend a complaint. The Tribunal has discretion to grant amendments to determine \u201c\u2026the real questions in controversy between the parties,\u201d if granting them would be in the interests of justice (Canada (Attorney General) v. Parent, 2006 FC 1313 (CanLII) at para. 30). The Tribunal must consider the prejudice that granting the amendment would cause to other parties. Amendments will be allowed where the balance of convenience favours the complainant. The other party is not prejudiced as long as it is able to prepare itself and argue its position on the new issues being raised (Parent at para. 40). An amendment must also not result in a new complaint and must be linked to allegations giving rise to the original complaint (Cam-Linh (Holly) Tran v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2010 CHRT 31 (CanLII) at paras 17-18). In other words, there must be a nexus, in fact and in law, between the complaint and the amendment sought.\n[20] As explained below, I find there is a nexus between the Contested Claims and Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s original complaint and that the RCMP would not be prejudiced if the complaint is amended.\n(i) There is a sufficient nexus in fact and in law to the allegations in the complaint [21] The Contested Claims are linked in fact and in law with the complaint\u2019s allegations, particularly in relation to the claim of discrimination based on disability. While she did not formally use the term \u201caccommodation\u201d in her complaint, it is clearly centred on how the RCMP dealt with her and her disability. As she states in her response to the RCMP\u2019s motion, its treatment of her with respect to her disability is a clear \u201ccommon thread\u201d across the original and Contested Claims.\n[22] She claims that, after she filed the complaint, the RCMP continued to interfere with her efforts to get better and return to work, either by not accommodating her at her job in British Columbia or by effectively preventing her from moving to Saskatchewan.\n[23] Framed in legal terms, she contends that she was prevented from working due to her disability, which could amount to a discriminatory practice under s. 7 of the Act, and that her employer did not accommodate her to the point of undue hardship.\n[24] Thus, both the original complaint\u2019s allegations and the Contested Claims centre on how Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s disability was addressed and whether her needs were accommodated. There is a nexus between them.\n[25] Admittedly, Ms. Campos-Ruiz is also alleging in the Contested Claims that her family status was a factor in the discriminatory practices she experienced. This ground was not mentioned in the original complaint. However, I am satisfied that there is a sufficient linkage between facts surrounding this claim and her other failure-to-accommodate allegations to justify their inclusion in the complaint.\n[26] I therefore conclude that there is a nexus between all the Contested Claims and the original complaint.\n(ii) The RCMP would not be prejudiced if the complaint is amended\n[27] The RCMP would not be prejudiced if the complaint is amended. It has been aware of the Contested Claims since at least June 25, 2021, when the Commission\u2019s investigator completed the investigation report into the complaint. The report referred to the Contested Claims, but they were not assessed because the investigator believed that they were beyond the scope of the complaint. The investigator added, however, that if the complaint were referred to the Tribunal for further inquiry, Ms. Campos-Ruiz could \u201cask that the allegations be added at that time.\u201d\n[28] The RCMP argues that the investigator\u2019s comments have no bearing on the scope of the complaint. However, I find that they still show that the RCMP is well aware of the Contested Claims and cannot argue that Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s amendment request comes as a surprise.\n[29] The RCMP submits that Ms. Campos-Ruiz was \u201cobliged\u201d to amend her original complaint while the Commission was still dealing with it, and before it referred it to the Tribunal, pursuant to Rules 9.1 to 9.3 of the Canadian Human Rights Commission\u2019s Complaint Rules. It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to address how complaints are processed at the Commission stage before they are referred to the Tribunal. Ms. Campos-Ruiz may have had the option to amend under those rules. But, as I previously mentioned, the Tribunal also has the authority to allow a complaint to be amended where circumstances warrant it.\n[30] The RCMP contends that allowing the amendment will cause it significant prejudice by increasing the proceeding\u2019s cost, length, and complexity and by requiring it to produce further documents and witnesses, potentially including experts.\n[31] The hearing may indeed become more complex, but it is a necessary consequence of the fact that the issues Ms. Campos-Ruiz initially raised in her complaint ended up extending beyond the events that had occurred to that point. I am not persuaded that the RCMP as an organization will be significantly prejudiced in dealing with the additional related issues. Even though the complaint could have been amended at an earlier stage, nothing indicates that the RCMP will be unable to prepare itself to address the issues raised (Parent at para. 40).\n[32] In making these findings, I note that in a ruling that I am issuing simultaneously with this one, involving a complaint filed by her spouse, Mr. Campos-Ruiz, Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2023 CHRT 17, I hold that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to deal with his allegations that the RCMP discriminated against him based on the grounds of family and marital status by denying him a transfer from British Columbia to Saskatchewan. I caution the parties that the hearing into Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s complaint, including the Contested Claims, cannot be used to collaterally argue her spouse\u2019s allegations, which were not referred to the Tribunal for inquiry.\n[33] My remarks are particularly significant given the possibility, as discussed at the first case management conference call (CMCC), that the two complaints may be joined administratively for the purposes of the hearing. This is a separate issue that may be dealt with at a future CMCC.\n[34] For these reasons, I find that although the Contested Claims were not originally mentioned in her complaint, Ms. Campos-Ruiz may amend it to include the Contested Claims.\nVI. ORDER [35] Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s complaint is deemed to be amended to encompass the Contested Claims.\n[36] The RCMP\u2019s motion to strike the Contested Claims in Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s SOP is denied.\n[37] The Tribunal suspended the timelines for the RCMP to file its SOP pursuant to Rule 20 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137, pending the outcome of the motion. With the issuance of this ruling, the timelines are revived. The RCMP must now file its SOP by June 2, 2023. Ms. Campos-Ruiz may file her reply to the RCMP\u2019s SOP by June 9, 2023.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, ON\nMay 12, 2023\nAPPENDIX A\nThe Contested Claims in Ms. Campos-Ruiz\u2019s Statement of Particulars, which the RCMP requests be struck, are the following:\nParagraphs 29 to 31\nParagraph 33 (from \u201c- notwithstanding \u2013 accommodate.\u201d) to 41 of the \u201cPart A.

Lustig\nTable of Contents\nI. DECISION 1\nII. CONTEXT 1\nIII. ISSUE 2\nIV. ANALYSIS 2\nV. ORDER 3\nI. DECISION [1] Mr. Amond's complaint in this matter dated March 28, 2019, alleging discrimination by his employer Euro Link Logistic, on the ground of disability under section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \"Act\") is dismissed as it appears to have been abandoned.\nII. CONTEXT [2] On August 9, 2022, the Tribunal wrote Mr. Amond, the Commission Counsel and the Respondent's counsel an initial letter setting out \"information about what you need to do next and deadlines that you need to respect\". The information covered topics including the Open-Court Principle, Confidential Mediation, Tribunal Inquiry Process-Case Management and Resources to help you prepare your case. The letter requested the parties to reply to a number of questions including whether the parties wished to participate in mediation, in person or video conference preferences, representation, choice of language and accommodation needs. The letter requested a response to the questions before August 23, 2022, by email or mail to the Registry Office of the Tribunal. Phone numbers and fax numbers of the Registry Officer were also provided in case of any questions. The letter was sent by registered mail to Mr. Amond's address that had been provided to the Tribunal by the Commission and was returned as undeliverable.\n[3] Registry staff tried to reach Mr. Amond by phone on August 23 and August 25 at the phone number provided to the Tribunal by the Commission, but the calls went to voicemail and were not answered.\n[4] On August 29, 2022, the Tribunal sent an amended initial letter to the parties that was the same as the initial letter except that the date to respond was changed to before September 16, 2022. This letter was sent by regular mail and by courier to Mr. Amond at the address provided to the Tribunal by the Commission. On September 1, 2022, Registry staff again attempted to reach Mr. Amond at the phone number provided to the Tribunal by the Commission, but the call went to voicemail and was not answered. Both the Commission and the Respondent advised the Tribunal that the only contact information they had for Mr. Amond was the phone number and address used by the Tribunal in its correspondence and phone calls to Mr. Amond.\n[5] No response from Mr. Amond was received by the Tribunal to the amended initial letter. On January 27, 2023, the Tribunal received correspondence from the Respondent's law firm requesting that the complaint be dismissed as they had twice responded to the questions in the Tribunals letters and were aware that the Tribunal was unable to establish communication with Mr. Amond.\n[6] On March 15, 2023, the Tribunal wrote to the parties in which it attached a copy of the amended initial letter of August 29, 2022, and the Respondent's law firm's request for dismissal of the complaint of January 27, 2023. The letter stated that \"Unless we receive a response from the Complainant to this correspondence before March 31, 2023, explaining why he has not responded to our previous letters of August 9 and 29, 2022 and providing a response to the questions therein, we will act on the request of the firm representing the Respondent to dismiss the Complaint\". The letter was sent to Mr. Amond at the address provided by the Commission to the Tribunal by both regular mail and by courier. No response was received by the Tribunal to the letter from Mr. Amond and the registered letter was returned as unclaimed.\nIII. ISSUE [7] The sole issue to be determined by the Tribunal in this matter is whether the Complaint should be dismissed.\nIV. ANALYSIS [8] Rule 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Rules of Procedure (the \"Rules\") provides that the Rules are to be interpreted and applied so as to secure the informal, expeditious and fair determination of every inquiry on its merits. Rule 9 of the Rules provides that if a party does not comply with these Rules, an order of a panel or a time limit established under these Rules, the panel may, on the motion of another party or its own initiative, and having regard to the circumstances, dismiss the complaint to achieve the purpose set out in Rule 5.\n[9] In the circumstances set out above, in this case the Tribunal has done everything reasonable to reach Mr. Amond to allow his complaint to proceed but Mr. Amond has not responded to any attempt by the Tribunal to reach him. As such, it appears that he has abandoned his complaint and pursuant to Rule 5 of the Rules it should be dismissed.\nV. ORDER [10] Mr. Amond's complaint in this matter is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

During a workplace incident, Sue Fleming, a co-worker, grabbed her around the neck. Ms. White alleges that because of this incident, and previous interactions with Ms. Fleming, she developed health problems requiring accommodation, namely remaining physically separated from Ms. Fleming. Ms. White alleges that CNL failed to accommodate her disability-related needs because it required her to resume face-to-face contact with Ms. Fleming which made her health worse. CNL argues that it did not know, and could not reasonably have known, that the complainant had a disability that may have required accommodation.\n[2] The hearing in this matter is set to begin on January 16, 2023. On January 10, 2023, both CNL and Ms. White asked the Tribunal to order each other to produce documents they say are arguably relevant to the issues in this case.\n[3] CNL sent its request by way of email communication. From there followed multiple emails, which included several serious allegations and claims about counsel. In a direction, I ordered the parties to clarify their respective disclosure requests and responses. They complied with this direction.\n[4] The Commission did not participate in the email exchanges beyond confirming that it had complied with its disclosure obligations. It did not take a position on the production requests.\nConduct of counsel\n[5] The following comments do not engage the Canadian Human Rights Commission or their counsel, past or present.\n[6] On January 10, 2023, the parties sent several email communications to the Tribunal. The first email from CNL included a brief request for an order for production. Before the Tribunal could provide direction to the other parties and seek their submissions, counsel for Ms. White responded. Her email included a troubling narrative about interactions between her office, counsel for CNL, his office, as well as serious allegations involving counsel. Ms. Roth also wrote that should an order for disclosure be issued against Ms. White, the order would be challenged, and that \u201c[u]ndoubtedly, in that case, the Hearing will be adjourned until the decision is reviewed\u201d. It included Ms. White\u2019s own request for production, sent for the first time in this responding email.\n[7] After receiving 7 communications from counsel for Ms. White and CNL, I was compelled to issue a direction ordering the parties to immediately stop writing to the Tribunal unless they were making a specific request for my intervention or responding to a Tribunal direction. They were also ordered to communicate in a manner that \u201cbefits respect for each other, the process, the Tribunal, and its mandate\u201d. I noted the Tribunal\u2019s obligation to conduct its proceedings fairly and in an expeditious fashion, but also that counsel have their part to play in this. I recalled that \u201c[d]iverting scarce resources to read through, respond and address issues that may not even be necessary for a determination of the issues in dispute in these complaints does not favour an expeditious outcome in this matter.\u201d\n[8] Finally, I ordered the Registry to triage the parties\u2019 communications and to stop forwarding messages to me unless they complied with my direction, noting that exchanges that should properly be addressed to counsel only did not fall into this category. I indicated that all materials falling outside these parameters would be returned to the parties and would not be included in the Tribunal\u2019s file.\n[9] Unfortunately, this is not the first time I have had to remind counsel to behave with respect and courtesy in these proceedings. This type of behaviour is not helping the Tribunal in its task and is a waste of our collective resources. \u201cConduct that may be characterized as uncivil, abrasive, hostile, or obstructive necessarily impedes the goal of resolving conflicts rationally, peacefully, and efficiently, in turn delaying or even denying justice ..\u201d (Groia v. Law Society of Upper Canada, 2018 SCC 27 at para 64, citing K. A. K. A. Nagorney, \u201cA Noble Profession? A Discussion of Civility Among Lawyers\u201d (1999), 12 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 815, at p. 817) [Groia].\n[10] The parties may make requests for a Tribunal order, namely making a request for an order for production. But it is not acceptable when responses and ensuing correspondence include inflammatory, accusatory language that falls short of the requirements of the civility, courtesy, and respect that I have already directed the parties to maintain. I will address this with counsel when the hearig opens. \u201cPracticing law with civility brings with it a host of benefits, both personal and to the profession as a whole. Conversely, incivility is damaging to trial fairness and the administration of justice in a number of ways.\u201d (Groia, at para 63). I expect counsel to choose their battles wisely, to be proportionate in their handling of this file and to refrain from any incivility going forward.\nDECISION\n[11] CNL\u2019s request is allowed. Ms. White\u2019s request is denied.\nREASONS\n[12] Parties must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case (s. 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d). This includes the right to the disclosure of all arguably relevant information held by the opposing party so each party knows the evidence they are up against and can prepare for the hearing. See Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2019 CHRT 8 at para 4. The Tribunal\u2019s Rules require parties to disclose a copy of all documents in their possession that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief that is sought in the case, including those identified by other parties (Rule 19(1)(e). This is also an ongoing obligation (Rule 24(1)(2)).\n[13] The threshold for disclosure is arguable or possible relevance. While this threshold is not particularly high, a party seeking production of a document must still show that there is a rational connection between the document it seeks and the issues raised in the complaint (T.P. v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2019 CHRT 19 at para 11; Turner v. CBSA, 2018 CHRT 1 at para 30 [Turner]. Requests for disclosure should not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition (Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2017 CHRT 33 at paras. 31-32 [Egan] and Turner at para 30).\n[14] The fact that documents are disclosed does not mean that they will be admitted as evidence at the hearing. If a party takes issue with the proposed evidence, it can raise this at the hearing and can also make submissions on the weight that the decision-maker should give that evidence if it is admitted at the hearing.\nCNL\u2019s request for an order for production\n[15] CNL wants the Tribunal to order Ms. White to produce a copy of notes she made on alleged harassment in the workplace. It says that it only discovered the existence of these notes on January 10, 2023 when one of CNL\u2019s legal representatives was reviewing the originals of documents already disclosed at the offices of Ms. Roth, counsel for Ms. White. The CNL legal associate noticed a series of stapled pages in the hard copy of Ms. White\u2019s notebook that did not appear to have been previously disclosed. Counsel for CNL asked to review them on a without prejudice basis to determine their relevancy.\n[16] Ms. White opposes the request. She initially said the requested notes were personal in nature. She later added that these notes are related to the harassment she alleges she experienced from her former co-worker but are not arguably relevant to the issues in dispute. According to Ms. White the notes do not refer to anything she discussed with her managers and supervisors. The notes will not allow the Tribunal to decide whether CNL\u2019s duty to inquire about possible accommodation was triggered, whether it inquired, whether it provided accommodation because of disability, and\/or whether it failed in these duties. Ms. White says that \u201conly the harassment reported\u201d is relevant to the issues in dispute in this case, and not any incident she did not report or convey to her employer. Finally, Ms. White submits that CNL\u2019s request is a fishing expedition, is meant to discredit Ms. White, is speculative, and that CNL wanted the notes before it learned that they were about harassment.\n[17] In my view, the notes are arguably relevant and should be disclosed. Ms. White is not asking the Tribunal to make findings about harassment under s. 14 of the Act and the harassment Ms. White refers to is not based on a prohibited ground of discrimination. However, Ms. White\u2019s complaint alleges that CNL failed to accommodate a disability which she says was either caused - or exacerbated by - harassing treatment in the workplace, which required CNL to accommodate her by ensuring she avoid all face-to-face contact with the co-worker who assaulted and harassed her. While CNL initially accommodated her health issues, it takes the position that it did not knowingly fail to accommodate Ms. White because it was not aware that she was still experiencing significant health issues related to the incident involving her co-worker.\n[18] As a result of the nature of the allegations and CNL\u2019s response, in my view, the notes on harassment are arguably relevant to the issues in this case. Ms. White has alleged that the harassing behaviour is the cause of her disability or has aggravated her health condition, and CNL takes the position that it did not, and could not reasonably have known, about her ongoing health issues or a disability. Given how the protected characteristic in this case \u2013 disability \u2013 is so closely related to these incidents and allegations of workplace harassment, the notes are arguably relevant and must be produced. I do not find the request to be a fishing expedition and CNL has explained the factual basis for its belief that the records exist and are relevant to the issues in dispute.\n[19] Further, as the parties well know, this is not evidence before the Tribunal, and has not been admitted.\nMs. White\u2019s request\n[20] Ms. White is asking the Tribunal to order CNL to produce \u201call notebooks from 2012 to 2015 of: Caroline Allen, Marty Kapitan, Andrea Denby, Laura Dykstra, Sandra Faught, Karry LeBlanc, Barry Lamirande, Steven Anderson, Daniel Sullivan, and Robert Thistle.\u201d\n[21] She says that CNL disclosed limited notes from Caroline Allen that relate to Ms. White\u2019s reporting of harassment, the assault, and the accommodation she required. Ms. White also says that in preparing for the hearing, she interviewed witnesses who were employed by CNL during the relevant times. She learned that \u201call incidents and instances of observations regarding harassment, Ms. White\u2019s health and concerns were reported to Ms. Allen, Mr. Kapitan, Ms. Dykstra, and Ms. Denby, amongst others\u201d and \u201cthey were all noted in the respective individuals\u2019 notebooks\u201d. Ms. White submits that supervisors and managers also followed this practice of keeping notebooks. According to Ms. White these notes have not been provided, and CNL never advised of this practice and the existence of these notebooks.\n[22] CNL opposes the request. It says that Ms. White\u2019s request is a fishing expedition, that she has not identified who she interviewed and when. It submits that the claim that all incidents were reported in all the notebooks is absurd on its face given how unlikely it is that the witnesses saw each one of the ten individuals whose notebooks are sought write down details of all of Ms. White\u2019s alleged harassment incidents. Finally, it argues that it already conducted a thorough sweep of its records earlier in the proceedings and produced all it could. Ms. White has not supported her request with anything concrete to suggest that the alleged notebooks either exist or contain relevant information that has not been produced.\n[23] Ms. White maintains these notes are relevant to interactions among and by Ms. White\u2019s supervisors and managers regarding the alleged harassment, her disability and concerns she and others say they voiced to their supervisors and management. She submits that this information will assist the Tribunal in determining the extent of the information conveyed by Ms. White and others in this regard, presumably to help establish the duty to inquire, and to accommodate Ms. White because of her disability. She maintains this is not speculative and not a fishing expedition.\n[24] Ms. White\u2019s request is denied. As the parties know, disclosure obligations are ongoing. If any of the parties were to discover materials that are arguably relevant to the issues in this file, they are required to disclose them. But I am not prepared to order production of 3 years of notebooks for ten individuals based on a statement a witness may have made during preparation for the hearing at this late stage, particularly as it is not clear that the notebooks exist, or that what they contain is even going to assist the Tribunal in its task. The request is speculative, and I do not find a sufficient basis to order production or another search through all of CNL\u2019s records based on what Ms. White has provided as the foundation for her request.\nORDER\n[25] CNL\u2019s request is allowed. Ms. White must provide a legible, electronic copy of the requested notes in their entirety no later than noon ET on Friday, January 13, 2023 to the other parties. She must also send a confirmation to the Tribunal that she has complied with this order.\n[26] If a party intends to introduce this document into evidence, it should send a copy to the Tribunal\u2019s Registry for inclusion in the Joint Book of Documents no later than Monday January 16, 2023 and I will address this at the hearing, as needed.\n[27] Ms. White\u2019s request is dismissed.\nSigned by\nJennifer Khurana\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJanuary 12, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2252\/0718\nStyle of Cause:\nStacy White v.

CONCLUSION 11\nVI. ORDER 11\nI. OVERVIEW [1] On March 2, 2023, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the Respondent, filed a motion with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the Tribunal) requesting that it:\na)strike the following paragraphs from the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars: 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 23;\nb)require the Complainant to submit an updated Statement of Particulars that no longer includes allegations of retaliation and\/or allegations in relation to events that post-date the filing of her complaint; and\nc)Permit the Respondent to submit an amended Statement of Particulars based on the Complainant\u2019s updated Statement of Particulars.\n[2] On March 29, 2023, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the Commission) informed the Tribunal and the parties that it does not take a position with respect to the Respondent\u2019s motion.\n[3] On April 11, 2023, Ms. Safia Mohamed, the Complainant, filed her arguments in response to RBC\u2019s motion requesting that the Tribunal dismiss RBC\u2019s motion, that it allow her to amend her initial complaint to add an act of reprisal or that it revive the reprisal complaint that she had filed and consolidate it with the initial complaint.\nII. DECISION [4] The Tribunal dismisses RBC\u2019s motion and declares that the allegations of retaliation, described in Ms. Mohamed\u2019s Statement of Particulars filed on November 26, 2021, are included in the scope of the initial discrimination complaint.\nIII. ISSUES [5] This ruling determines whether the Tribunal should consider the allegations of retaliation as part of the complaint. To make this determination, the Tribunal must answer the following questions:\na) What are the legal principles guiding the Tribunal\u2019s approach to this determination?\nb) Is the Tribunal bound by the Commission\u2019s investigator\u2019s Procedural Instructions to the Complainant?\ni. Did the Commission receive a new complaint alleging retaliation?\nii. If the Commission did not process a retaliation complaint, is the Tribunal bound by the procedural process imposed by the investigator?\nc) Does the Complainant need to file a new complaint alleging retaliation?\nd) If the answer to question c) is no, do some paragraphs from Ms. Mohamed\u2019s Statement of Particulars need to be struck out?\nIV. ANALYSIS A) What are the legal principles guiding the Tribunal\u2019s approach to this determination? [6] In Prassad v. Canada (Ministry of Employment and Immigration), 1989 CanLII 131 (CSC), [1989] 1 SCR 560, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) stated that, as a general rule, administrative tribunals are considered \u201cmasters in their own house\u201d. The SCC added that, \u201cIn the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, [as is presently the case] they [the administrative tribunals] control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice.\u201d\n[7] It is well established that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to amend, clarify and determine the scope of a complaint provided that no prejudice is caused to the other parties (Casler v. Canadian National Railway, 2017 CHRT 6, paras. 7-11 [Casler]; Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canadian Telephone Employees Assn., 2002 FCT 776, at paras. 30 and 31).\n[8] As part of its authority to determine the scope of a complaint, the Tribunal has the power to strike portions of a Statement of Particulars that exceed the scope of the complaint. However, the Tribunal must exercise its authority \u201ccautiously\u201d and only in the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d (Richards v. Correctional Service Canada, 2020 CHRT 27 at para. 86).\n[9] Under section 44(3) and section 49 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. H-6 (the Act or CHRA), a request to the Tribunal to institute an inquiry into a complaint may be made only when the Commission has considered the complaint. Indeed, the SCC in Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, at para. 48 states that the Act sets out a complete mechanism for dealing with complaints and that the Commission is central to that mechanism.\n[10] The well-established case law (see for example Casler and Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation v. Public Service Alliance of Canada (Local 70396), 2006 FC 704) states that the scope of the dispute before the Tribunal may not introduce a new complaint that has not already been considered by the Commission and that does not respect the Commission\u2019s request to institute an inquiry. The Tribunal therefore does not have the power to deal with a complaint that has not been dealt with first by the Commission and that has not been referred to the Tribunal for inquiry (see Cook v. Onion Lake First Nation, 2002 CanLII 61849 (CHRT), [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 12) [Cook]). It is therefore necessary that the Tribunal confine itself to the complaint, the Commission\u2019s decisions with respect to the complaint and, in particular, the request for inquiry that the Commission has made to the Tribunal.\n[11] The concept of a complaint is nevertheless broad enough to be interpreted in a way that encompasses the full extent of a complainant\u2019s allegations (Cook, para. 11). A complaint is the first step in the process, and it is inevitable that new facts and circumstances will come to light in the course of the Commission\u2019s investigation (Casler). The complaint is refined and clarified as the process moves forward (Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 1, para. 11) [Gaucher]).\n[12] However, a limit is necessary when the amendment to a complaint can no longer be considered a simple amendment but is instead more like a new complaint (Gaucher). Likewise, upon reading a complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars, the allegations of facts to be analyzed by the Tribunal for the purposes of determining the dispute must somehow emanate from or arise out of the complaint itself and must not depart from it in such a way as to constitute a new complaint.\nB) Is the Tribunal bound by the Commission\u2019s investigator\u2019s Procedural Instructions to the Complainant?\n[13] The Tribunal is of the opinion that it is not bound by the Procedural Instructions that the Canadian Human Rights Officer, Ms. Kellie Leclerc, imposed on Ms. Mohamed concerning the incorporation of allegations of retaliation into her initial complaint.\n[14] On March 28, 2019, during Ms. Leclerc\u2019s investigation of the complaint that was filed on November 26, 2018, Ms. Mohamed was terminated from her employment.\n[15] Following her termination, Ms. Mohamed expressed to Ms. Leclerc on multiple occasions that she intended to make allegations of retaliation. Ms. Leclerc consistently indicated to Ms. Mohamed that she needed to file a new complaint alleging retaliation for the Commission to consider the termination of her employment a retaliatory measure. She told Ms. Mohamed that she could not address it through an amendment of her initial complaint.\n[16] For example, on February 13, 2020, Ms. Leclerc wrote a Memorandum to File following a call to Ms. Mohamed, which states the following:\nIn response to her email, I called the complainant and left her a voicemail to let her know I would contact her counsel as requested and to also let her know that she has to file a reprisal complaint for the termination of her employment in the same way that she filed the first, that it is not a matter of me amending her Complaint Form.\nI let her know that she has a year to do so and that the termination letter indicated that her employment was terminated in March 2019 so I emphasized that she needs to file this complaint soon if that is what she wants to do. (\u2026)\n[Emphasis added]\n[17] On February 18, 2020, Ms. Leclerc wrote a second Memorandum to File providing the same Procedural Instructions after talking to Ms. Mohamed\u2019s counsel.\n[18] On March 24, 2020, a letter addressed to the Commission and signed by Ms. Mohamed\u2019s counsel was sent. It says: \u201cDelivered by Email: Complaint@chrc-ccdp.gc.ca\u201d. The letter also states: \u201cI am the lawyer acting on behalf of Safia Mohamed. Please find enclosed the executed Complaint Registration form and Schedule \u201cA\u201d, which we respectfully request be filled\u201d.\n[19] The Schedule \u201cA\u201d reads as follows:\n1. I am filing an additional complaint against Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) for terminating my employment as an act of reprisal, harassment and discrimination for filing my initial complaint. The events below took place after the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d) accepted my complaint, file number #20181286, dated November 25, 2018. At the time I filed my complaint I was employed with RBC until my unlawful termination on March 28, 2019.\n(\u2026)\n[Emphasis added]\n[20] On the November 24, 2020, Ms. Leclerc recommended that the Commission refer the complaint to be heard by the Tribunal. In her report annexed to the recommendation, she wrote the following:\n(\u2026)\n122. She [Ms. Mohamed] alleges that the respondent\u2019s termination of her employment was retaliatory in further violation of the Act, because she complained about her managers\u2019 treatment of her and filed a complaint with the Commission. She did not file a retaliation complaint with the Commission, however. Should the Commission adopt this report\u2019s recommendation, the circumstances surrounding the termination of the complainant\u2019s employment may be included in the inquiry at Tribunal.\n(\u2026)\n[Emphasis added]\n[21] On February 19, 2021, Ms. Leclerc wrote a third Memorandum to File that states the following:\nI contacted Ms Mohamed and left her a voicemail to confirm to her that both parties have an extension for their cross-disclosure submissions and to let them know that she cannot file a retaliation complaint because, as we had discussed, when she had the opportunity to do so she did not complete her complaint form in time at this point it is out of time.\n[Emphasis added]\n[22] On May 19, 2021, the Commission (the Deputy Chief Commissioner and the Commissioner) decided to refer the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry. The Commission\u2019s decision indicates the following:\n(\u2026)\nThe Officer investigated only the allegations related to adverse differential treatment under section 7 of the Act, which was sufficient to form a recommendation for referral to Tribunal.\n(\u2026)\n[Emphasis Added]\n[23] On May 20, 2021, the Commission requested that the Tribunal institute an inquiry into the complaint. In its letter, the Commission did not restrict in any way the referral of the complaint. The Commission found that the allegations investigated by Ms. Leclerc were sufficient to require an inquiry by the Tribunal.\n[24] It is settled law that the Commission need not investigate every allegation to determine whether an inquiry by the Tribunal is appropriate (see Casler). Indeed, in the present case, this is what emanates from the Commission\u2019s May 19, 2021, decision or in its May 20, 2021, letter to the Chairperson of the Tribunal. Moreover, this is also what emanates from Ms. Leclerc\u2019s November 24, 2020, recommendation to the Commission: \u201cShould the Commission adopt this report\u2019s recommendation, the circumstances surrounding the termination of the complainant\u2019s employment may be included in the inquiry at Tribunal\u201d. The Tribunal understands that by referring to Ms. Mohamed\u2019s \u201ctermination\u201d, Ms. Leclerc is referring, by necessary implication, to the allegations of retaliation that Ms. Mohamed wanted to include in her complaint.\n[25] To determine whether the Tribunal is bound by the Procedural Instructions imposed by the Commission\u2019s investigator, it is necessary in the present case to determine first whether a new complaint alleging retaliation was in fact filed.\n(i) Did the Commission receive a new complaint alleging retaliation? [26] The Tribunal is of the opinion that there is no probative evidence that the retaliation complaint that was possibly sent by Ms. Mohamed\u2019s counsel was in fact received by the Commission.\n[27] On the one hand, the evidence shows that a letter from Ms. Mohamed\u2019s counsel addressed to the Commission was sent via email to the Commission\u2019s complaint email address. On the other hand, Ms. Leclerc, who was still investigating the initial complaint in March 2020, does not mention in her subsequent communications that a second complaint was received by the Commission.\n[28] Moreover, on November 24, 2021, counsel for the Commission filed her Statement of Particulars. There is no mention that the Complainant made allegations of retaliation.\n[29] On November 26, 2021, counsel for the Commission filed her disclosure of documents list which does not include a second complaint that would have been filed by Ms. Mohamed\u2019s counsel on March 24, 2020.\n[30] Counsel for RBC mentions that RBC never received any information concerning this March 24, 2020, complaint.\n[31] What happened to that March 24, 2020, complaint?\n[32] Knowing that, in March 2020, the COVID-19 Pandemic had started and that many businesses and government offices were not functioning at their optimum level, it is possible that some administrative mishap happened.\n[33] Therefore, the Tribunal is unable to conclude whether the Commission received the March 24, 2020, complaint but can conclude that the Commission did not process a new complaint alleging retaliation.\n(ii) If the Commission did not process a retaliation complaint, is the Tribunal bound by the Procedural Instructions imposed by the investigator? [34] As previously mentioned, on the one hand, Ms. Leclerc indicates in her November 24, 2020, report that the circumstances surrounding the termination of the Complainant\u2019s employment (which includes allegations of retaliation) may be included in the inquiry before the Tribunal if the recommendations made in her report are adopted by the Commission.\n[35] On the other hand, she told Ms. Mohamed on numerous occasions that to make allegations of retaliation, she had to file a new complaint within the 12 months following her termination. Ms. Leclerc informed Ms. Mohamed that she could not amend her initial discrimination complaint to add these allegations, and, on February 19, 2021, she told her it was too late to do so.\n[36] In its motion, RBC argues that, as Ms. Mohamed did not file a specific retaliation complaint as instructed specifically by the Commission\u2019s investigator, she cannot add allegations of retaliation to her present complaint before the Tribunal.\n[37] The Tribunal rejects RBC\u2019s argument. The well-established case law specifies that the Commission is not bound by the investigator\u2019s recommendation. The Commission has discretion to request an inquiry by the Tribunal even if the investigator\u2019s report recommends dismissing the complaint. (Jorge v. Canada Post Corporation, 2021 CHRT 25 at para. 192 (Jorge); Prior v. Canadian National Railway Co., 1983 CanLII 4692 (CHRT). Moreover, in Jorge, the Tribunal differentiates between the \u201cCommission\u201d making a decision (members appointed to the Commission in accordance with section 26 of the Act) and the staff\/employees of the Commission, including the investigator. Thus, the Commission is not bound by the investigator\u2019s report.\n[38] As the Commission is not bound by the investigator\u2019s report, the Tribunal considers even more so that the Tribunal is not bound by the Procedural Instructions that Ms. Leclerc imposed on Ms. Mohamed.\nC) Does the Complainant need to file a new complaint alleging retaliation? [39] The Tribunal is of the opinion that there is no need to file a new complaint in order for Ms. Mohamed to make allegations of retaliation.\n[40] Not only is the Tribunal not bound by Ms. Leclerc\u2019s Procedural Instructions (the obligation to file a new complaint) as previously mentioned, but these instructions are also not supported by the established case law.\n[41] In the context of allegations of reprisal, the Tribunal has recognized that it would be \u201cimpractical, inefficient and unfair\u201d to require a complainant to file a separate complaint proceeding as this would necessitate their going to the end of the queue to obtain an investigation, conciliation and adjudication on matters which are fundamentally related to the proceedings already underway (Bressette v. Kettle and Stony Point First Nation Band Council, 2004 CHRT 2, para 6 [Bressette]; Tabor v. Millbrook First Nation, 2013 CHRT 9; Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2018 CHRT 2).\n[42] As stated in Virk v. Bell Canada, 2004 CHRT 10 at para. 7, generally speaking, an amendment to add allegations of retaliation should be granted unless it is plain and obvious that the amendment sought could not possibly succeed.\n[43] As stated in Bressette (at para. 6), when the Tribunal is required to analyze the scope of the complaint to decide whether allegations of retaliation should be considered, the Tribunal should not embark on a substantive review of the merits of these allegations.\n[44] Further, the case law (see as an example Letnes v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2019 CHRT 41) has specified that the particular test applicable when considering the addition of allegations of retaliation requires the examination of three criteria:\nwhether the allegations of retaliation are by their nature linked, at least by the complainant, to the allegations giving rise to the original complaint;\nwhether the allegations disclose a tenable claim of retaliation; and\nwhether sufficient notice has been given to the respondent, so that it is not prejudiced and can properly defend itself.\n[45] The first criterion of the test elaborated in Letnes is met.\n[46] Indeed, the paragraphs in dispute in Ms. Mohamed\u2019s Statement of Particulars are paragraphs 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 23. These paragraphs relate to retaliatory acts that RBC allegedly carried out following the filing of her initial complaint with the Commission. These paragraphs demonstrate that her dismissal was linked to the filing of the complaint.\n[47] Ms. Mohamed filed her complaint on November 26, 2018. She was fired four months later on March 28, 2019.\n[48] The allegations of discrimination that gave rise to the initial complaint are the fact that Ms. Mohamed was denied internal job promotions and job training opportunities. She also alleges that multiple managers made discriminatory comments towards her and that she suffered harassment during her employment. She also alleges that RBC did not accommodate her when it denied her the ergonomic work setup recommended by her doctor. She also added that some managers were making false accusations of wrongdoing against her, which can be considered discriminatory, and inappropriate sexual gestures.\n[49] The allegations of retaliation in her Statement of Particulars mention intimidation from directors and RBC\u2019s representatives and false disciplinary actions.\n[50] The Tribunal is of the opinion that the first criterion of the test established in Letnes is met as the allegations of retaliation are of the same nature as the ones that gave rise to the original complaint. At face value, these allegations seem to be part of a continuum that emanates from the facts alleged in the original complaint. There is a nexus between the two sets of allegations.\n[51] The second criterion of the test is also met as, if proven, these allegations of retaliation could be considered in contravention of section 14.1 of the Act that reads as follows:\n14.1 It is a discriminatory practice for a person against whom a complaint has been filed under Part III, or any person acting on their behalf, to retaliate or threaten retaliation against the individual who filed the complaint or the alleged victim.\n[52] Ms. Mohamed\u2019s allegations could possibly succeed if proven at the hearing. They are not bound to fail as was the case in Temate v. Public Health Agency of Canada, 2022 CHRT 31. In Temate, the allegations of retaliation referred to events that happened prior to the filing of the original complaint and therefore could not emanate from the filing of the complaint. It is clearly not the case in the present case as Ms. Mohamed alleges that acts of retaliation, including the termination of her employment, happened after she had filed her original complaint. The allegations of retaliatory acts are therefore defensible and tenable.\n[53] As for the third criterion, there is no evidence that RBC could suffer a prejudice considering the stage of the process the complaint has reached. The Tribunal has given RBC sufficient notice so that it would not be prejudiced and could properly defend itself in the circumstances. The hearing dates have not been decided yet, and the Tribunal is willing to allow RBC to amend its Statement of Particulars in order to consider the allegations of retaliation from Ms. Mohamed. RBC has therefore full and ample opportunity to present its arguments and to defend its position as required by the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\nD) If the answer to question C. is no, do some paragraphs from Ms. Mohamed\u2019s Statement of Particulars need to be struck out? [54] Considering that paragraphs 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 and 23 of Ms. Mohamed\u2019s Statement of Particulars are allegations of retaliation and considering that allegations of retaliation are included in the scope of the initial discrimination complaint, the Tribunal concludes that these paragraphs need not to be struck out.\nV. CONCLUSION For those reasons, the Tribunal rejects RBC\u2019s motion.\nVI. ORDER The Tribunal orders that:\nMs. Mohamed\u2019s Statement of Particulars stays intact; RBC can amend its Statement of Particulars to include elements related to the retaliation alleged by Ms. Mohamed; RBC has one month from the reception of the present ruling to file its amended Statement of Particulars; Ms. Mohamed has 15 days from the reception of RBC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particular to file a Reply; The Commission has 15 days from the reception of RBC\u2019s Amended Statement of Particular to file a Reply.

Thank you all for your helpful submissions, which I have carefully reviewed.\n[3] I agree with the Respondent and Commission that the Complainants\u2019 application amounts to a request to reopen their case because they are asking to call additional evidence after the Respondent has called its evidence. Even though the application is being made before the Complainants have officially closed their case, this is not a request to bifurcate the hearing, and so Tribunal cases in which that has happened are distinguishable.\n[4] This case is also distinguishable from other Tribunal cases where there were requests to reopen \u2013 including recent cases like Dorais v Canadian Armed Forces, 2023 CHRT 6 (CanLII) [\u201cDorais\u201d] and Marshall v Membertou First Nation, 2021 CHRT 36 (CanLII) [\u201cMarshall\u201d].\n[5] Just briefly, in Dorais, the hearing was over, closing submissions had been made and the Member was beginning his deliberations when the Complainant asked to reopen the case to introduce fresh evidence. The request was denied. In our case, I have not begun deliberating.\n[6] In the Marshall case, the Complainant\u2019s case was complete when the Respondent filed a motion for non-suit, which led to the Complainant asking to reopen his case to testify. There, the Tribunal allowed the Complainant to complete his case before the Respondent called its evidence, in order to avoid a miscarriage of justice. Here, a non-suit is not at play.\n[7] In the present case, the application is being made because Complainants\u2019 counsel misunderstood the Tribunal\u2019s procedure. There was a mistaken belief that remedy evidence would be heard only after the Tribunal had made a finding of discrimination. The Complainants argue that they should not be penalized because of their counsel\u2019s misunderstanding.\n[8] The Respondent is not opposed to the Complainants calling further evidence relating to remedy but argues that it should not have to call its own evidence until after the Complainants have finished calling all of their evidence. It argues that this is the only procedurally fair way to proceed.\n[9] The Respondent is correct that the CHRA and the Tribunal\u2019s Rules are structured so that the respondent responds to the complainant\u2019s and Commission\u2019s cases. The Respondent is also correct that reopening a case is done only in exceptional circumstances, and the Tribunal\u2019s case law supports this assertion (including both Dorais and Marshall).\n[10] The Complainants have made this application to \u201creopen\u201d prior to actually closing their case. They do not want to adjourn the hearing to keep their case open in order to call this evidence before the Respondent starts calling its evidence, which is what the Respondent wants, because this will likely cause a significant delay. While the Complainants\u2019 application, if granted, will also cause some delay, they are prepared to accept this in order to be able to have a full and ample opportunity to present their case.\n[11] As I agree with the Respondent\u2019s and Commission\u2019s characterization of the application as a request to reopen the Complainants\u2019 case following the Respondent\u2019s evidence, I agree that the factors set out in Dorais apply to determine if the inquiry should be reopened to allow the filing of additional evidence before the final decision of the Tribunal is rendered. I have analyzed each step in making this decision.\n[12] I note that, in Dorais, the first question that a decision maker must ask was framed as, \u201cWould the proposed new evidence, if presented, probably have changed the result of the inquiry into the complaint?\u201d While that formulation applies to cases where the hearing is complete and the decision was not yet rendered, like in Dorais, or in which the trial court had already rendered its decision (which was the case in the leading Supreme Court case of 671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 SCC 59 (CanLII)), I agree with the Respondent that the more appropriate question in a case such as this, where the request to reopen happens earlier in the proceeding is this question, which was set out by the Federal Court in Varco Canada Limited v. Pason Systems Corp., 2011 FC 467 (CanLII) [\u201cVarco\u201d] at paragraph 23: If presented, could the new evidence influence the result? In other words, is the evidence relevant?\n[13] I find that here, the answer is yes. The additional evidence proposed appears to be material to a key issue in dispute, being the potential award of public interest remedies, if the Tribunal finds that there was discrimination. The Respondent points out that the Complainants have not actually particularized what new evidence they seek to adduce, and it says the onus is on them to do so, and, but for this application, they have closed their case. The RCMP says a suggestion that they will find additional evidence is not sufficient. I disagree, but will discuss this issue further, later in this Ruling.\n[14] The second question set out in Dorais is: Could the evidence have been obtained before the inquiry by the exercise of reasonable diligence? The answer to this question on its face is also yes. The requested remedies were laid out in paragraphs 92, 97, 99, 100 -105 of the Complainants\u2019 Statement of Particulars and have therefore been \u201cin play\u201d for several years. I also accept that the failure to lead the evidence about the remedy was due to a misunderstanding of the Tribunal\u2019s process by counsel. As stated in Marshall, \u201c[p]arties are usually bound by what their representatives do and the positions they take.\u201d\n[15] The third question is: Do exceptional circumstances exist justifying the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to admit additional evidence? The Federal Court in Varco added this question to the two-part test to consider whether there are exceptional circumstances that would justify setting aside the \u201cdue diligence\u201d aspect of the test or at least reducing its overall importance in the exercise of discretion.\n[16] Here, I accept that this is such a case. I agree with the Commission that there are extraordinary circumstances at play in this inquiry, which deals with matters that touch on the relationships between Indigenous individuals, communities and the RCMP, the investigation of historical abuse claims, and the remedies that should be awarded if discrimination is found. In this case, while the Complainants have been very ably represented (unlike the Tribunal\u2019s finding in Marshall), I accept that, while it is unfortunate, errors do occur and an overly formalistic and rigid approach is not in keeping with the CHRA\u2019s overarching goals and the context of the case.\n[17] I agree with the Commission that, in the circumstances of this case, it is critically important to ensure that the Complainants have a full and ample opportunity to have their say, and that the matter be resolved in an expeditious way.\n[18] Finally, I must consider the residual question of prejudice to all parties. Again, the RCMP is not objecting to the evidence being called but asks that the hearing be adjourned so that the Complainants call all of their evidence first. There is a need to consider both the prejudice to the Complainants if I agree with the Respondent\u2019s proposal which will delay the hearing and the prejudice to the RCMP if I agree to the Complainants\u2019 proposal. Procedural fairness requires that parties know the case they have to meet and I of course take this principle seriously.\n[19] The Complainants would obviously be prejudiced by not being permitted to call the expert evidence relating to the public interest remedy set out in their Statement of Particulars. This is not controversial.\n[20] On the other hand, the Respondent says it will be unduly prejudiced if the Complainants\u2019 application is granted. I have carefully considered and will respond to each of the Respondent\u2019s concerns.\n[21] First, the Respondent says allowing the Complainants\u2019 request will force the RCMP to present its case without knowing the case to meet. Structuring the hearing in the way proposed is \u201cinherently prejudicial\u201d, it argues, since its case intertwines facts, the nature of the service, and remedy sought. I find that some of the prejudice is reduced by knowing about this application to reopen prior to the RCMP calling its case, unlike in other cases where all evidence was called, final submissions were made, and a party was taken by surprise by a request to reopen. Furthermore, as it is a discrete issue related to one type of remedy, prejudice can be remedied by permitting the RCMP to respond and call its own evidence and to recall its witnesses if necessary. In other words, I do not find that the Respondent will be stymied in any way in responding to the core allegation of discrimination if I allow this request.\n[22] Second, the Respondent argues that allowing the Complainants to call further evidence after they have closed their case would allow them to call additional evidence to respond to the Respondent\u2019s case, which would be an unfair benefit to the Complainants. The RCMP says the legal and factual issues in the present case are complex and span a period of over 50 years. It argues that they cannot be neatly separated and compartmentalized in such a way as to view the remedies sought in the Complainants\u2019 SOP as discrete from the other issues.\n[23] The Complainants say their additional evidence will not touch on more than remedies: they do not propose to call further evidence on the issue of liability through their proposed process. I find that this concern is mitigated by the fact that objections to the proposed evidence can still be made if it goes to issues outside the specific remedy. I will be alive to this and receptive to any arguments made on this basis.\n[24] Third, up until the time the application was made, the Respondent says that it believed that the Complainants would close their case before the RCMP started to present its case (as is the normal course.) It had no reason to believe otherwise and relied on this assumption when determining how to present its case. Given how far along the current proceedings are, the RCMP says it cannot restructure its case now in the manner the application contemplates. While I accept that this application will present some challenges to the Respondent, I also note that these remedies were included in the Complainants\u2019 Statement of Particulars (SOP) since June of 2020 so presumably the Respondent had prepared its case to respond to what was in the SOPs of the Complainants and Commission. This is not exactly a situation where a Party is proposing to introduce \u201cfresh evidence\u201d that no one was aware of until the point it is introduced. Also, the Respondent has asked to call an additional witness who was not on its witness list at a late date, whose evidence does not relate to the investigation but to how the RCMP conducts investigations now. The Respondent is also seeking a measure of procedural flexibility in its own favour, and we can discuss that later.\n[25] The RCMP argues that the prejudice caused by the Complainants being able to re-open their case would not be cured by allowing it the opportunity to respond. I disagree.\n[26] The Commission has argued that in the unique circumstances of this case, the potential inefficiency associated with the Complainant\u2019s request may be preferable to the alternatives of foregoing the proposed evidence or adjourning hearing dates to delay the start of the RCMP\u2019s case. I agree. In this case the Tribunal needs to balance the goal of truth-seeking - allowing all parties, but especially the Complainants in terms of this identified remedy, a full and ample opportunity to present their case - with the need to proceed expeditiously and fairly.\n[27] While it may be ideal to allow the Complainants to call all of their evidence before requiring the Respondent to begin calling its evidence, permitting this to happen would mean further delay beyond that proposed by the Complainants in order to allow the calling of this additional evidence to happen and the circumstances of the complainants and witnesses in this case are such that the need to proceed expeditiously is paramount.\n[28] Delay in this case has already had real consequences \u2013 in addition to the three complainants who have passed away, one witness had a stroke after testifying and one testified that he has a heart condition.\n[29] Having carefully weighed all of the information and factors, I find that while there may be some prejudice to the Respondent in granting the application, the prejudice to the Complainants in not being able to call this evidence and complete the hearing in a timely manner is greater.\n[30] We can proceed expeditiously and still be fair to the Respondent, even if it means it does not wait to call its whole case because protections can be put in place.\n[31] The additional evidence the Complainants wish to call is limited to remedy, and really only one distinct remedy \u2013 and they have proposed calling expert evidence on this, in writing, with written cross-examination. I am not prepared to order written cross-examination unless all Parties agree to that, but we have time to figure out the process and I do not need to rule on that right now.\n[32] As I mentioned earlier, one issue is that we do not know what evidence the Complainants actually intend to call and there is some prejudice to the Respondent in this so I will also determine (as with all evidence) whether the proposed evidence will be admissible and, if it crosses any evidentiary lines, it can be excluded.\n[33] In reaching my decision, I am guided by the Federal Court in Varco, which said at paragraph 22:\nIn my view, when all of the various factors, tests and considerations are taken together, the importance of the integrity of the trial process \u2013 the search for the truth through evidence \u2013 is an overarching consideration.\n[34] Having decided to allow the Complainants\u2019 request, I agree with most of the Respondent\u2019s alternative proposal set out in its submissions. The RCMP has requested that, in the alternative, should the Tribunal grant the application, it should set deadlines that provide the parties sufficient time to consider and list additional evidence and that do not prejudice the Commission or Respondent. While the Respondent laid out proposed timelines, I prefer to schedule a case management conference call or receive written submissions from all Parties before establishing such a timeline.\n[35] Upon consideration of all of the submissions and the law on this question, this is my order:\nI grant the Complainants\u2019 application to reopen their case on the limited issue of remedies as laid out in paragraphs 92, 97, 99, 100 -105 of their Statement of Particulars;\nThe Tribunal will work with the Parties to set timelines that provide the Parties with sufficient time to prepare for this such that the Respondent and Commission will not be prejudiced;\nI order that all of the evidence from both segments of the hearing become evidence in the whole.\n[36] We can proceed with the hearing today, and as scheduled. If we need additional days to allow the RCMP to finish calling its case, we will look at our calendars on June 22, if we are not finished by then. We can also hold another CMCC in the next couple of weeks, or I can receive written suggestions from the parties about how to proceed with the additional evidence the Complainants intend to call, in terms of timelines and process.\nSigned by\nColleen Harrington\nTribunal Member\nDelivered Orally by Zoom videoconference at a Case Management Meeting on\nMay 31, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2459\/1620\nStyle of Cause:\nWoodgate et al. v RCMP\nRuling of the Tribunal Dated: May 31, 2023\nMotion dealt with in writing without appearance of parties\nWritten representations by:\nKaren Bellehumeur and Angeline Bellehumeur , for\nthe Complainants\nChristine Singh and Jonathan Bujeau, for the Canadian Human Rights Commission\nWhitney Dunn, Mitchell Taylor KC, Nima Omidi, Zahida Shawkat, Jennifer Rogers and Spencer Slipper , for\nthe Respondent\n",

Order 24\nI. Background [1] This is a ruling issued by the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) deciding the motion filed by the Complainant, Ms. Laura Nash. In her motion, the Complainant asks the Tribunal to summon and enforce the attendance of General Jonathan Vance (\u201cGeneral Vance\u201d) and to compel him to testify in the inquiry and produce any evidence that the Tribunal considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint, under paragraph 50(3)(a) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[2] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) was, at first, in favour of Ms. Nash\u2019s motion. But, when the Tribunal asked for additional representations, the Commission revisited its position and informed the Tribunal that it no longer took a position on said motion. However, it did provide its comments on the general principles the Tribunal should consider. As for to the Canadian Armed Forces (the \u201cForces\u201d), they strongly objected to the motion to summon and enforce attendance.\n[3] The Tribunal Registry received Ms. Nash\u2019s motion to summon and enforce attendance on Friday, January 27, 2023, at 4:01 p.m. Eastern time. This was one business day before the beginning of the hearing, scheduled from January 30 to February 22, 2023.\n[4] Since the motion was filed at the last minute before the hearing began, the Tribunal had no choice but to deal with the motion at the commencement of the hearing. That said, the Tribunal had to hear another motion filed by Ms. Nash a few days earlier. Oral representations on the motion to summon and enforce the attendance of General Vance were heard on Tuesday, January 31, 2023.\n[5] In their representations, the Forces raised an important argument regarding deliberative secrecy. The Tribunal therefore asked them to file case law authorities in support of their claims. The parties then had the opportunity to make their representations on this subject. Once all this was done, the Tribunal took the motion under advisement the morning of February 1, 2023.\n[6] However, that same day, early in the afternoon, Ms. Nash asked to address the Tribunal in confidence to provide it with additional representations regarding her motion to summon and enforce the attendance of General Vance.\n[7] The parties met with the Tribunal behind closed doors to discuss how to proceed. They all agreed to Ms. Nash providing additional information by affidavit, under a confidentiality order made by the Tribunal under subsection 52(1) of the CHRA. The issue was eventually resolved several days later, on February 7, 2023, after the Tribunal received all the parties\u2019 representations regarding Ms. Nash\u2019s affidavit; the Tribunal therefore took the motion under advisement that day.\n[8] The hearing moved forward as scheduled. Ms. Nash presented all her evidence, filed her documents and called all her witnesses. The Tribunal therefore had to decide the motion to summon and enforce attendance concerning General Vance right then and there so that Ms. Nash could rest her case.\n[9] The Tribunal dismissed Ms. Nash\u2019s motion and informed the parties that the reasons would follow in a written decision. This decision constitutes the Tribunal\u2019s reasons.\nII. Issue [10] The Tribunal must decide, under paragraph 50(3)(a) of the CHRA, whether it should summon and enforce the attendance of General Vance and compel him to testify in the inquiry and produce any evidence the Tribunal considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint. To this end, the Tribunal must consider the fact that Ms. Nash\u2019s motion was filed at the last minute, examine the necessity and relevance of General Vance\u2019s testimony and assess whether summoning him would undermine the principle of deliberative secrecy.\nIII. Decision [11] For the reasons that follow, the Tribunal dismisses Ms. Nash\u2019s motion and refuses to summon and enforce the attendance of General Vance as a witness in this inquiry.\nIV. Analysis [12] The Tribunal notes that it is not required to repeat all the arguments made by the parties. It will analyze the motion in light of the arguments of the parties it considers to be necessary, essential and relevant in order to render its decision and explain the reasons for that decision, which must be transparent, intelligible, and justified (Turner v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FCA 159, at para. 40; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]).\nA. Positions of the parties (a) Complainant [13] In February 2014, Ms. Nash filed a grievance against the Forces alleging discrimination based on sex and marital status. That grievance ended up before General Vance, who at the time of the grievance was the final authority able to dispose of such a remedy. At the time of the filing of Ms. Nash\u2019s complaint, General Vance was also Chief of the Defence Staff in the Forces.\n[14] The Tribunal will not repeat the contents of General Vance\u2019s decision dated February 27, 2019, concerning Ms. Nash's grievance. For the purposes of this ruling, it is important to understand that the grievance was denied. However, General Vance awarded Ms. Nash an ex gratia payment and mentioned that the grievance had drawn his attention to several important issues concerning certain policies and their potential revision to respond to the realities of modern life and family composition.\n[15] Ms. Nash asked that General Vance be summoned as a witness so that he could testify regarding his report dated February 27, 2019. Ms. Nash used the word \u201creport\u201d, which is not a minor detail, and the Tribunal will come back to this later in this ruling.\n[16] In her motion before the Tribunal, she describes General Vance\u2019s testimony in the following terms:\nRetired General Jonathan Vance is the author of the Final Policy Grievance Response, and who can speak specially to his own report.\n[17] Ms. Nash argued that this testimony is relevant and necessary with regard to the inquiry so that the Tribunal can dispose of it. She added that the probative value of the evidence he will provide is greater than the prejudicial effects she would suffer if her motion to summon and enforce attendance were rejected.\n[18] Ms. Nash explained that General Vance was directly involved in her case because he reviewed the evidence submitted to him in connection with her grievance regarding allegations of discrimination and made a decision based on the review of her file and the evidence presented.\n[19] She argued that General Vance is the only person who can testify on this report and on the applicable policies related to the allegations in her grievance. In her view, he is the only person who can testify on the Forces\u2019 policies and the harassment that occurred; he is the final authority on policy and, as such, may request changes in this regard.\n[20] She added that General Vance would be able to guide the Tribunal and explain his report, in particular by detailing why he had found that there was no discrimination, setting out his reasons for taking so much time before deciding the grievance, and discussing the follow-up he did on policy revisions. Ms. Nash stated that the time that had elapsed before the decision was made is a current issue in her complaint.\n[21] She confirmed for the Tribunal that she has not filed an application for judicial review of General Vance\u2019s report and claims that his testimony is not intended to prove discrimination.\n[22] She believes that, for reasons of procedural fairness and natural justice, and despite the lateness in filing, the Tribunal should grant her motion. She stated that she had decided not to call one of her witnesses, which frees up hearing time that could be reallocated to General Vance\u2019s testimony while respecting the fundamental principle under the CHRA that proceedings should be conducted as expeditiously as possible.\n[23] She believes that subsection 50(3) of the CHRA gives the Tribunal, which is not a court of law, all the latitude it needs to summon General Vance as a witness at this stage of the proceedings. She argued that the Tribunal is not a review court, and as such will not have to review General Vance\u2019s report, and that General Vance could be of assistance to the Tribunal by articulating his position regarding the Forces and their policies and could testify on the long time it took to deliver his report.\n[24] She added that her witness is her response to the confirmation of individuals who would testify for the Forces, whose names were also given the Friday before the hearing began.\n[25] In the end, on the basis of her affidavit\u2014which is protected by a confidentiality order\u2014Ms. Nash asked the Tribunal to apply a trauma-informed approach. Accordingly, in her view and because of her trauma, mental health issues and fears, there are reasons explaining why she was late in filing her motion to summon General Vance as a witness.\n[26] As for deliberative secrecy, the Complainant argued that the Tribunal could intervene and lift the veil of deliberative secrecy with regard to General Vance\u2019s decision. The Tribunal will come back to this argument later in its decision.\n(b) Respondent [27] One of the Forces\u2019 main arguments is that, when General Vance rendered his decision on Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance on February 27, 2019, he was acting as an administrative decision-maker.\n[28] They referred the Tribunal to the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N\u20115 (\u201cNDA\u201d), which establishes the process for filing a grievance, with the final authority having the power to deal with the grievance, and the available challenge mechanism, namely, judicial review by the Federal Court.\n[29] The Forces therefore argued that it is impossible for the Tribunal to summon General Vance as a witness when he was acting as final authority and an administrative decision-maker in Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance. The Forces stated that if the Complainant did not agree with the decision that was rendered, she should have applied to the Federal Court for judicial review. She then could have challenged the documents consulted by the decision-maker and argued that the decision was not clear and did not meet the minimum requirements for a decision. The Forces added that if Ms. Nash had concerns about the time needed for General Vance to render his decision, she should have applied to the Federal Court for mandamus, which was the appropriate remedy available at that time.\n[30] The Forces argued that the parties are not entitled to expect a decision-maker or a judge to explain their decision before another decision-making body. In their view, what Ms. Nash is asking for, to summon an administrative decision-maker as a witness and have him comment on or explain his decision, is quite simply impossible in law. General Vance, as an administrative decision-maker, is protected by deliberative secrecy, and his decision is shielded from any interference. At the Tribunal\u2019s request, the Forces filed case law authorities on the concept of deliberative secrecy.\n[31] The Forces added that Ms. Nash has had General Vance\u2019s decision in her possession since February 2019 and that her complaint before the Commission was filed well before that. They submitted that Ms. Nash had never argued that the decision was discriminatory or constituted harassment, and, in their view, these elements are not before the Tribunal. Nor did the Commission refer the Tribunal to the fact that the time that elapsed before General Vance rendered his decision was itself discriminatory.\n[32] All in all, the Forces argued that General Vance\u2019s testimony is not relevant to the inquiry. They had announced quite some time ago that they intended to call two persons to speak about policies in the Forces. They argued that Ms. Nash had never mentioned that she wanted to call General Vance as a witness and that her motion was filed at the very last minute. In their view, such a late request amounts to a fishing expedition and may even be bordering on abuse of process.\n[33] In the end, the Forces stated that General Vance is now retired and that the lawyers representing them before the Tribunal are not representing him at this stage of the proceedings. Therefore, summoning General Vance as a witness could give rise to a motion to quash the summons to appear, along with the consequences related to it.\n[34] Regarding Ms. Nash\u2019s affidavit, the Forces generally asked the Tribunal not to consider it, since the information provided by Ms. Nash is not relevant. In their view, the Complainant had countless opportunities to ask the Tribunal to summon General Vance as a witness, which she did not do.\n[35] The Forces added that Ms. Nash has been represented by counsel for years in this proceeding and that her fears regarding her safety and the confidentiality of her personal information could have been addressed with her lawyer.\n[36] The Forces submit that Ms. Nash\u2019s argument, according to which summoning General Vance as a witness is a response to the late filing of the names of two of their witness who were to speak about policy, is baseless. The Forces repeated that they have been announcing their intention to call these witnesses since 2020 and provided a description of their testimony. They merely had to confirm the names of the people coming to testify, which did not affect the nature of the testimony as set out in the summaries of their testimony.\n(c) Commission [37] As was mentioned above, the Commission revisited its position during its arguments. Initially, it supported the Complainant\u2019s position and presented arguments in this regard.\n[38] After the Tribunal asked for additional representations on the issue of deliberative secrecy, the Commission revised its position and decided to no longer take a position on the motion. Instead, it decided to make general representations to the Tribunal regarding the principles applicable to this matter.\n[39] Given this unexpected change, the Tribunal will not refer to the Commission\u2019s representations that at the time supported the Complainant\u2019s position, since they are now without merit and no longer support its current position. In any event, there is nothing new in the Commission\u2019s representations since Ms. Nash essentially repeated them in her own representations.\n[40] However, the Commission\u2019s additional representations are interesting and nonetheless enlightening to the Tribunal. The Commission noted that it plays a screening role with respect to the complaints it receives. In Ms. Nash\u2019s case, the Commission confirmed that there were other internal remedies available to her, more specifically, a grievance resolution process within the Forces.\n[41] The Commission stated that its current practice is to defer to these other processes where it is appropriate and expeditious to do so, which is what it did in the case of Ms. Nash. Her complaint was thus held in abeyance while she exhausted these other options. The Tribunal therefore understands that General Vance\u2019s decision regarding Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance is the culmination of this process.\n[42] That said, the Commission decided in the end to reactivate the complaint at Ms. Nash\u2019s request. At that point, General Vance\u2019s decision had not yet been rendered.\n[43] The Commission noted that, in its complaint screening role, the goal was not to determine whether there was discrimination; its role was, rather, to refer the complaint to the Tribunal if there were grounds for doing so. Moreover, the Commission added that, in its review, the Forces did not file a defence. It decided to refer Ms. Nash\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry.\n[44] In light of the preceding, the Commission argued that General Vance\u2019s testimony is, in its view, potentially relevant in terms of both the personal remedies claimed by Ms. Nash and the systemic ones sought in this case. It also considers that the time that elapsed before General Vance rendered his decision is, in its view, another important aspect of the case before the Tribunal.\n[45] The Commission added that General Vance will be able to testify in the case and provide the Tribunal with evidence without the Tribunal having to judicially review the decision he rendered in February 2019. According to the Commission, there is a difference between General Vance\u2019s role as an administrative decision-maker and his other role in the Forces.\n[46] The Commission argued, just as the Complainant did, that the Tribunal could lift the veil of deliberative secrecy and that there are valid concerns regarding breaches of the rules of natural justice in the grievance process leading to General Vance\u2019s decision.\n[47] The Commission also stated that the affidavit filed by the Complainant could affect the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the motion to summon and enforce attendance and on the delay in its filing. Finally, it argued that the Forces did not demonstrate that they would suffer any prejudicial effects if General Vance were called as a witness.\nB. Late filing of motion and prejudicial effect [48] The Tribunal considers that, on its own, this element is grounds enough to dismiss Ms. Nash\u2019s motion.\n[49] Ms. Nash\u2019s hearing was supposed to begin on January 30, 2023, at 9:30 a.m. On Friday, January 27, 2023, at 4:01 p.m., the Tribunal received Ms. Nash\u2019s email in which she asked the Tribunal to issue a summons to enforce General Vance\u2019s attendance under paragraph 50(3)(a) of the CHRA.\n[50] In other words, Ms. Nash\u2019s motion to summon General Vance and enforce his attendance was received one business day before the hearing was to start, a few minutes before the Tribunal\u2019s offices\u2019 closing time. Such a late motion to summon a witness and enforce their attendance is inherently problematic, especially coming from a party represented by counsel.\n[51] The Tribunal has rules of procedure, \u201cwhich guide the parties regarding what they are required and expected to do, to accomplish, and consequences if they fail to comply with such rules\u201d (Vadnais v. Leq\u2019\u00e1:mel First Nation, 2022 CHRT 38 (CanLII), at para. 7 [Vadnais]).\n[52] The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137 (the \u201cRules of Procedure\u201d) \u201cset expectations [and] guide the parties regarding each step of the proceedings\u201d (Vadnais, at para. 8). They clearly state that a party who intends to call a witness must announce, in advance, their intention to summon the witness and must provide a summary of the witness\u2019s testimony (see paragraphs 18(1)(e), 19(1)(d) and 20(1)(d) and subsection 21(2) of the Rules of Procedure).\n[53] That party has a duty to inform the other parties, and the Tribunal, in a timely manner of their intentions regarding the facts they intend to raise in the proceeding, the remedies sought, the defences they will rely on and the ordinary or expert witnesses who will testify at the inquiry. A summary of their testimony must also be filed (Vadnais, at para. 29).\n[54] Paragraph 37(b) of the Rules of Procedure is unequivocal and specifically provides for the situation where a person has not informed the parties of their intention to call a witness and has failed to provide a summary of the witness\u2019s testimony:\n37 A party may\n\u2026\n(b) call a witness at the hearing only if that witness was identified and a summary of their anticipated testimony was provided under rule 18, 19, 20 or 21;\n[Emphasis added.]\n[55] In other words, if a party breaches their duty to announce their intention to call a witness and provide a summary of the witness\u2019s testimony in a timely manner, they can not have such a witness testify at the hearing. This is precisely the situation Ms. Nash found herself in when she failed to inform the parties and the Tribunal in a timely manner of her intention to call General Vance as a witness.\n[56] Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedure sets out the consequences of not complying with the rules:\n9 If a party does not comply with these Rules, an order of a panel or a time limit established under these Rules, the panel may, on the motion of another party or its own initiative, and having regard to the circumstances, order the party to remedy their non-compliance, proceed with the inquiry, dismiss the complaint or make any other order to achieve the purpose set out in Rule 5.\n[Emphasis added.]\n[57] However, Rule 8 of the Rules of Procedure allows a member to dispense with compliance with the Rules of Procedure if doing so achieves the purpose set out in Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure.\n[58] Rule 5 the Rules of Procedure provides that:\n5 These Rules are to be interpreted and applied so as to secure the informal, expeditious and fair determination of every inquiry on its merits.\n[59] In Ms. Nash\u2019s case, at no time in three years of case management did she make her intention to call General Vance as a witness known. This is a completely new, and unexpected, motion made at the end of the Tribunal\u2019s business hours, the day before the hearing was to start. In holding back this information, Ms. Nash directly prevented the other parties from preparing themselves accordingly and hindered their ability to react to such a motion (Vadnais, at para. 31). Such a late motion also does not leave the witness who could be summoned to testify with a reasonable amount of time to react to such a situation.\n[60] Ms. Nash\u2019s late motion inevitably caught the Tribunal off guard as well. This motion could not be dealt with in the short time allowed, which left the Tribunal with no choice but to consider the motion at the very beginning of the hearing when there was already so much to be done, including dealing with another motion that Ms. Nash had herself filed a few days before the hearing.\n[61] The fact that the Tribunal is an administrative tribunal and not a court of law as Ms. Nash and the Commission argue\u2014which would give it the necessary flexibility to summon General Vance in the circumstances\u2014does not, however, give it free rein to completely dispense with the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness either. The Tribunal must comply with its enabling statute and its rules of procedure, as prescribed by subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA (see also Vadnais, at para. 6).\n[62] That being said, as the Tribunal noted in Whyte v. Canadian National Railway, 2009 CHRT 33, at paragraph 12, a party who files a late request and does not comply with the Rules of Procedure in this regard will also have to show how their request is not prejudicial to the other parties and to the Tribunal's process (see also Vadnais, at para. 15). The Tribunal must necessarily consider the interests of justice when a party files a late request (Vadnais, at para. 16).\n[63] Ms. Nash made additional representations to explain why she had delayed filing her motion to summon General Vance as a witness. These representations are protected by a confidentiality order. The Tribunal will not disclose sensitive information, but it must nonetheless provide some context so that readers can understand its reasons. The Tribunal has a duty to give reasons that are intelligible, transparent and justifiable (Vavilov, mentioned above).\n[64] The main takeaway is that Ms. Nash provided explanations that justify, in her view, the lateness in filing her motion to summon General Vance as a witness. According to her, she considered calling this witness more than a year prior to this but, in the end, decided not to do so. She had concerns regarding safety and confidentiality if she had to call him as a witness.\n[65] When she learned just before the hearing that her personal information\u2014address, telephone number, ID numbers, etc.\u2014would be protected, she then considered calling General Vance as a witness.\n[66] She added that the Tribunal should adopt a procedure that is informed by the trauma that persons involved in the process have experienced. Because of her trauma and mental health issues, she argues that she had reasons explaining her delay in filing her motion.\n[67] On the one hand, the Tribunal fully agrees that it should adopt an approach informed by the trauma experienced by the parties involved in its proceedings. The Tribunal strives to reduce as much as possible any trauma that may be experienced\u2014or re-experienced\u2014in a quasi-judicial proceeding such as its own. To this end, the Tribunal always tries to adapt its procedure to each situation and to the parties appearing before it, all while taking into account any trauma the participants may have experienced. It has all the flexibility it needs to ensure that the procedure makes sense for the parties (subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA).\n[68] An approach informed by the trauma experienced by the persons involved is designed to ensure that they feel that the Tribunal\u2019s procedure offers them a safe environment. Such an approach tries its best to minimize the effects of a proceeding such as ours on these individuals.\n[69] On the other hand, a trauma-informed approach does not mean that the parties and the Tribunal do not have to comply with the fundamental principles of procedural fairness and natural justice. The Tribunal is still subject to those principles (subsection 50(1) of the CHRA). Such an approach does not reduce the burden on a party either.\n[70] A trauma-informed approach exists side by side with these fundamental principles. So, how can we make sure that the proceeding will have as little impact as possible on the person who has experienced trauma? How can the Tribunal guide them through this process while still upholding the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness for all the parties involved in the inquiry into the complaint? This is clearly a very delicate task.\n[71] In our case, the main point raised by Ms. Nash in her affidavit, which is protected by a confidentiality order, is the fact that because of her trauma and mental health issues, she had good reasons for her delay in filing her motion to summon General Vance and enforce his attendance. She had fears regarding her safety and the confidentiality of her information. The Tribunal understands what Ms. Nash has shared and is sorry to hear about what she has experienced and about the fear and worries she has endured and continues to endure.\n[72] The Tribunal has no doubt as to the emotions experienced by Ms. Nash and thanks her for sharing them in confidence. That said, the Tribunal\u2019s official record shows that protecting the personal information of the parties and individuals involved in the case is not a new issue. The parties and the Tribunal addressed this on September 28, 2022, during a case management conference call.\n[73] Beyond Ms. Nash\u2019s fears and her individual case, the Tribunal is always mindful of the public nature of its hearings and the voluminous quantity of documents filed in its cases. Accordingly, a great deal of personal information may be found in the public domain. Attempts must be made, to the extent possible, to protect this information, especially when it is not necessary for the public or for the Tribunal in carrying out its mandate to determine whether there was any discrimination.\n[74] The summary of the conference call on September 28, 2022, squarely addresses the issue of protecting the personal information of the participants in this inquiry and states the following:\nMember Gaudreault advised that the hearing will be open to members of the public and explained to the parties that it\u2019s very important to redact personal information from proposed exhibits to ensure it\u2019s not accidentally disclosed. Member Gaudreault also explained that a confidentiality order can be filed if needed.\n[75] The goal was to ensure that the personal information of the individuals involved in the case, including that of Ms. Nash, would be protected and that it would not make its way into the public domain without good reason. Such a situation makes more sense where the hearing is held by videoconference and documents are shared with all participants and may also be consulted by members of the public. The Tribunal finds that there is no prejudice to the public in not having access to this personal information.\n[76] That said, Ms. Nash did not participate in that call, unfortunately, but her lawyer was present and was aware of the fact that her client\u2019s information would be protected. There is no reason to believe that Ms. Nash was not informed of this, as she was represented by counsel and the Tribunal systematically shares summaries of case management calls with the parties.\n[77] If Ms. Nash had concerns about her personal information and had understood in September 2022 that everything was going to be protected, the Tribunal and the parties could have dealt with the issue of calling General Vance as a witness months before the hearing.\n[78] It is therefore unfortunate that Ms. Nash did not hear the Tribunal\u2019s intervention in person in this regard. She would have realized that the Tribunal was fundamentally committed to protecting the personal information of participants, including her own, which could have reduced, as the Tribunal hopes, her stress, fear and concerns. This information may have reassured her enough to raise the issue with the Tribunal and the parties.\n[79] Several options could therefore have been explored. Ms. Nash could have shared her concerns and fears confidentially, as she did at the hearing, in a private meeting with the member and the other parties or during a mediation-adjudication session.\n[80] Ultimately, the Tribunal must consider that the matter of protecting personal information was addressed more than four months before the hearing began. Therefore, it must conclude that Ms. Nash\u2019s motion to summon and enforce attendance, which is based in large part on her being unaware of the possible protection of her personal information, was filed late, just a few minutes before offices closed on the eve of the hearing. Filing such an important motion so late is contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure.\n[81] As for the approach that the Tribunal should adopt, that is, an approach informed by the trauma experienced by its participants, it should be noted that the Tribunal was not made aware, in a timely manner, of the evidence submitted by Ms. Nash in her affidavit. For this reason, the Tribunal could not intervene in this regard and take the necessary steps to support Ms. Nash in what she had experienced and was still going through. It was unable to adapt its procedure to the Complainant\u2019s personal circumstances. In other words, the Tribunal could not intervene regarding elements it was not aware of.\n[82] Finally, Ms. Nash argued that the probative value of the evidence that General Vance would give before the Tribunal outweighs the prejudicial effects she would be subjected to if her motion to summon and enforce attendance were dismissed, despite its lateness.\n[83] First, we will see later on in the analysis that the testimony of General Vance, if he were called as a witness, would inevitably be limited because of the very nature of his role in Ms. Nash\u2019s case and her reasons for asking him to testify. These significant limitations necessarily affect the relevance and usefulness of his testimony. The Tribunal will come back to these elements in the next section.\n[84] Second, a motion to summon and enforce attendance filed so late would inevitably have consequences in terms of the hearing and its conduct. In that vein, the Commission argued that the Forces had not demonstrated any prejudicial effects.\n[85] On this point, it should be noted that was difficult to find common dates when both the Tribunal and the five lawyers in this case, as well as a handful of paralegals providing support, would all be available. The case was scheduled to last 18 days, months before it began. In light of this difficulty, it was absolutely necessary that the hearing start as scheduled and follow its course, without interruption. It should also be added that the Tribunal and the parties quickly realized that they would run out of time, as the allotted 18 days would not be enough to finish the hearing.\n[86] In addition, the Complainant confirmed that she had not yet communicated with General Vance and did not have his contact information. This means that she asked the Tribunal to summon and enforce the attendance of a witness without the slightest idea of when he would be available, where he was or whether he would contest his summons.\n[87] If the Tribunal had summoned General Vance on such short notice, it would have been necessary to suspend the hearing while the Complainant took steps to find him, serve the summons on him, pay for his witness fees and, possibly, take time to prepare him. And yet there was no guarantee that General Vance, first, could be found and, second, would be available to attend the hearing on the dates that had been scheduled months before it began. All this could have happened within the space and with advance notice of only a few working days, when the Tribunal and the parties had been preparing this case for many months, even years.\n[88] In the case at hand, the prejudicial effect and the interests of justice would suggest dismissing the motion, or otherwise risk interrupting the 18-day hearing that had been scheduled months ago and all the necessary preparations for the witnesses, lawyers, paralegals, the Tribunal and its staff, in order to be ready to proceed. The Complainant did not satisfy the Tribunal that the delay in filing such a motion to summon and enforce attendance was justified and that the prejudicial effect could be corrected, even though she had decided not to have her doctor testify.\n[89] The Tribunal also acknowledges the importance of finishing this case as expeditiously as possible. Moreover, Ms. Nash stated multiple times that the proceeding was long and clearly expressed her desire for the case to be over. If Ms. Nash\u2019s motion had been granted, the Tribunal finds that this would have had, without a shadow of a doubt, an effect on the hearing and the management of the evidence and that this would have drawn out the proceeding.\n[90] Once again, the Tribunal is sensitive to what Ms. Nash has gone through and understands her fears and concerns. However, it must be noted that, in filing her motion at the last minute, she took the other parties and the Tribunal by surprise, which meant that no one was able to anticipate such a request and prepare themselves accordingly. This is also contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[91] Therefore, it was not in the interests of justice to allow this motion and have to suspend the proceeding or postpone it to give Ms. Nash time to do what she intended to do. The entire system would have been affected, and that is in nobody\u2019s interest.\n[92] Finally, Ms. Nash explained that the delay in filing her motion to summon General Vance as a witness was her response to the Forces\u2019 late filing of the names of their witnesses who were going to testify about the Forces\u2019 policies. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument.\n[93] The Forces informed the Tribunal and the parties long ago that they were going to call two witnesses to speak about their policies, but this in itself was not a problem in the proceeding. According to Ms. Nash\u2019s affidavit, it appears that the main reason she was late in seeking a summons for General Vance was, rather, related to her fears and concerns regarding her safety.\n[94] It should be added that the Complainant also has the burden of making out a prima facie case of discrimination. Ms. Nash\u2019s primary role is to present to the Tribunal all the evidence required to support her arguments and allegations. Ms. Nash therefore had to identify, in advance, the witnesses she needed, which includes any witness who could have testified on the allegations relating to the Forces\u2019 policies, and summon them in a timely manner, regardless of the witnesses announced by the Forces.\n[95] In addition, General Vance was not a mystery witness or totally unknown because Ms. Nash already knew of his involvement, since he rendered his decision in February 2019. On this point, she admitted having considered the option of calling him as a witness more than a year ago. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Ms. Nash\u2019s argument that summoning him was a response to the Forces\u2019 late filing of its list of witnesses. It is unfortunate that this motion was not filed in a timely manner.\n[96] In conclusion and for these reasons, the Tribunal dismissed Ms. Nash\u2019s motion. That said, other elements also favour dismissing her motion, and this will be discussed in the next section of this decision, in particular with regard to the relevance and necessity of General Vance\u2019s testimony.\nC. Necessity, relevance and deliberative secrecy [97] Paragraph 50(3)(a) of the CHRA provides that the Tribunal has the power to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses it considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint. In the French version of the CHRA, subsection 50(3) states:\n(3) Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\na) d\u2019assigner et de contraindre les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser verbalement ou par \u00e9crit sous la foi du serment et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte, au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019archives;\n[98] The English version reads as follows:\n(3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(a) in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record, summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint;\n[99] Although the wording is not exactly the same in the two versions\u2014testimonies considered \u201cindispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte\u201d in the French version versus \u201cnecessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint\u201d in the English version\u2014the same meaning emerges: the testimony must be necessary and relevant with regard to the complaint.\n[100] In other words, there must be a connection between the evidence that a party is seeking through the testimony of a witness and a fact, a question of law or a remedy (Dorais v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2021 CHRT 13 (CanLII), at para. 21; Schecter v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2005 CHRT 35 (CanLII), at para. 21).\n[101] First of all, the Tribunal has already concluded that Ms. Nash had delayed in summoning General Vance as a witness in the proceeding and that she did not provide sufficient justification for the Tribunal to dispense with its Rules of Procedure and the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness.\n[102] This delay must also be analyzed in light of the probative value of the potential testimony of General Vance, if he were called as a witness. The fact of the matter is, as the Tribunal will explain in the paragraphs below, that General Vance\u2019s testimony would be fundamentally limited, given the nature of his involvement in Ms. Nash\u2019s case, which would consequently affect the necessity and relevance of his testimony.\n[103] It seems clear to the Tribunal that Ms. Nash is trying to summon General Vance not as a mere ordinary witness who could testify regarding facts of which he had knowledge that are relevant to the hearing. Rather, Ms. Nash is trying to summon him as a witness so that he can testify regarding the decision he rendered on February 27, 2019, concerning the grievance she filed against the Forces in 2014.\n[104] In other words, Ms. Nash is trying to summon General Vance in his capacity as an administrative decision-maker and as the final decision-making authority in the decision to deny her grievance on February 27, 2019. To this end, the Tribunal does not have the power to summon this individual, who as an administrative decision-maker is protected by deliberative secrecy.\n[105] The Tribunal notes that, in her motion to summon and enforce attendance dated January 27, 2023, Ms. Nash summarized the testimony of General Vance in clear terms, as follows:\nRetired General Jonathan Vance is the author of the Final Policy Grievance Response, and who can speak specially to his own report.\n[106] The summary of his testimony is unequivocal: Ms. Nash wants General Vance to be summoned as a witness to speak to his \u201creport\u201d dated February 27, 2019.\n[107] That said, when the Tribunal looked at General Vance\u2019s \u201creport\u201d, as Ms. Nash describes it, this raised several questions. In this \u201creport\u201d, it is clearly stated that the \u201cdecision\u201d\u2014by General Vance\u2014is final, without appeal within the Forces and binding, in accordance with the National Defence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5 (\u201cNDA\u201d). It is also stated that his \u201cdecision\u201d is not subject to appeal or review by any other court, except for judicial review under the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, (\u201cFCA\u201d).\n[108] It is also mentioned that an application for judicial review may be made to the Federal Court within 30 days of his \u201cdecision\u201d, in accordance with subsection 18.1(2) of the FCA (see C-109 \u2013 Decision of J.H. Vance, General, dated February 27, 2019, at pages 15 and 16).\n[109] Now, the Tribunal finds that Ms. Nash tried to redirect the problem by describing the document produced by General Vance as a \u201creport\u201d. It is obvious to the Tribunal that the document produced by General Vance is not a \u201creport\u201d but a decision. General Vance acted as an administrative decision-maker and ruled on a grievance for which he produced a decision. Counsel for the Complainant had a hard time accepting this obvious fact, despite the Tribunal\u2019s questions and interventions to this effect to make her understand the true nature of the document produced by General Vance.\n[110] Thus, and if the Tribunal accepts the summary of General Vance as produced by Ms. Nash, the reason she is asking the Tribunal to summon General Vance is so that he can testify about his decision regarding her grievance. In other words, Ms. Nash wants to ask him questions related to his decision dated February 27, 2019, in which he denied her grievance.\n[111] The arguments presented to the Tribunal also confirm, on a balance of probabilities, that the only reason General Vance intervened in Ms. Nash\u2019s case is related to the filing of her grievance. Ms. Nash did not make any other arguments that would allow the Tribunal to come to a different conclusion or demonstrate that General Vance, apart from the grievance, had a role to play in the allegations relating to her complaint. Therefore, except for the grievance filed by Ms. Nash in 2014, there is nothing to demonstrate that General Vance, the Chief of the Defence Staff, would have had any involvement in her case.\n[112] General Vance, in rendering his decision denying Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance, was acting as an administrative decision-maker. In Commission scolaire de Laval v. Syndicat de l\u2019enseignement de la r\u00e9gion de Laval, 2016 SCC 8 (CanLII) [Laval], the Supreme Court reiterated that a judge cannot be required to explain or account for their judgment or decision. Demanding that a decision-maker, or a judge, be summoned to testify as a witness to explain how and why they made their decision is a direct attack on judicial independence (Laval, at para. 57).\n[113] Also in Laval, the Supreme Court noted that deliberative secrecy also protects the deliberations of administrative tribunals or decision-makers but that the protection is not as watertight as it is for judges in courts of law (Laval, at para. 58). On this point, in Tremblay v. Quebec (Commission des affaires sociales), 1992 CanLII 1135 (SCC) [Tremblay], the Supreme Court stated the following at page 966:\nAccordingly, it seems to me that by the very nature of the control exercised over their decisions administrative tribunals cannot rely on deliberative secrecy to the same extent as judicial tribunals. Of course, secrecy remains the rule, but it may nonetheless be lifted when the litigant can present valid reasons for believing that the process followed did not comply with the rules of natural justice.\n[114] Accordingly, there is an exception to the principle of deliberative secrecy in the case of an administrative decision-maker. It should come as no surprise that the Complainant did indeed argue that the Tribunal should apply this exception and lift the veil of deliberative secrecy since General Vance\u2019s decision-making process did not, in her view, comply with the rules of natural justice. The Tribunal does not intend to dwell much on this argument.\n[115] The Tribunal notes that General Vance\u2019s decision is not subject to review except by a supervising court, in this case, the Federal Court, in accordance with section 29.15 of the NDA. It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to supervise the decision-making process or the decision itself of General Vance in his capacity as final authority in the grievance process. The Tribunal is in no way in a supervisory position with respect to this decision or the decision-making process. General Vance carried out the mandate conferred upon him by his enabling statute, decided Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance in his capacity as an administrative decision-maker and denied her application.\n[116] Thus, it is up to a supervising court to determine whether the decision-making process of an administrative tribunal or decision-maker did not comply with the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. As an administrative tribunal, the Tribunal does not have this power over a decision rendered by another administrative decision-maker.\n[117] In a similar vein, all the case law filed by the Forces regarding deliberative secrecy concerns supervising courts when they perform a superintending or reforming function in respect of decisions by decision-makers from lower courts or other bodies (see for example Timm v. Canada, 2019 FC 36 (CanLII); Laval and Tremblay, mentioned above; Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board), 2001 SCC 4 (CanLII), [2001] 1 SCR 221).\n[118] In those decisions, the Supreme Court or the Federal Court, as the case may be, took a position, as supervising court, on the issue of the deliberative secrecy of a board or a board member, that is to say, an administrative decision-maker just like the Tribunal.\n[119] Now, the Tribunal has no trouble seeing how the Federal Court or the Supreme Court, in performing its superintending function, could lift the veil of deliberative secrecy of an administrative decision-maker because of serious fears that the decision-making process did not comply with to the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. However, neither the Complainant nor the Commission offered any arguments or authorities that would demonstrate that the Tribunal, as an administrative decision-maker, has the power to lift deliberative secrecy in respect of another administrative decision-maker when there is no supervisory or superintending relationship between them.\n[120] Consequently, if the Tribunal intervened to determine whether General Vance\u2019s decision and his decision-making process complied with the principles of natural justice, this would necessarily amount to the Tribunal assuming the role of a supervising court or tribunal. This is nothing short of an indirect challenge of General Vance\u2019s final decision before our Tribunal when judicial review by the Federal Court was the right path to take if the Complainant had grounds to contest the decision.\n[121] That being said, all the issues related to the decision-making process followed by General Vance, including why the decision sat untouched on his desk for nearly two years, why he took so much time to render his decision and how the system could have been more compassionate and flexible in its treatment of Ms. Nash, as stated in his decision, etc.\u2014in short, everything to do with General Vance\u2019s decision, directly or indirectly\u2014is fundamentally protected by deliberative secrecy. The Tribunal does not have the authority to lift this veil and cannot summon General Vance to provide details regarding his decision-making process or his decision.\n[122] Accordingly, since General Vance is protected by deliberative secrecy, what remains of his testimony if he cannot comment, directly or indirectly, on his decision dated February 27, 2019, concerning Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance? Clearly, it must be concluded that there is not much left.\n[123] Ms. Nash argued that General Vance could testify, in broader terms, about the Forces\u2019 policies at issue in her complaint before the Tribunal. Once again, and according to what was presented to the Tribunal, the only reason General Vance intervened in Ms. Nash\u2019s case is in relation to her grievance. That General Vance would speak about general polices in the Forces, without being able to tie them to Ms. Nash\u2019s personal circumstances, makes his testimony less relevant. If he had to tie the implementation of a policy or the application of policy to the Complainant\u2019s situation, in the end, it would come down to doing exactly what he did in his decision of February 27, 2019, since in his decision, he highlights Ms. Nash\u2019s allegations and the application of several Forces policies, policies that are also at issue in her complaint before the Tribunal.\n[124] Therefore, Ms. Nash did not present any probative arguments allowing the Tribunal to conclude that the rest of General Vance\u2019s testimony is sufficiently relevant and necessary with regard to dealing with the complaint. Moreover, the probative value of the rest of General Vance\u2019s testimony on the Forces\u2019 policies, in general, without being able to tie them to his decision regarding Ms. Nash\u2019s grievance, does not outweigh the risks in violating deliberative secrecy. Accordingly, the Tribunal is not satisfied that it would be necessary to summon this witness and enforce his attendance pursuant to paragraph 50(3)(a) of the CHRA.\nV.

OVERVIEW\n[1] Jamus Dorey, Karolin Alkerton, David Huntley and Roderick McGregor (\u201cthe Complainants\u201d) opened Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs) at financial institutions between 2015 and 2019. They no longer qualify for grants and bonds under the Canada Disability Savings Act, SC 2007, c 35, s 136 (CDSA) and the Canada Disability Savings Regulations, SOR\/2008-186 (CDSR or \u201cthe Regulations\u201d) because they are all over 49 years of age. The Complainants say that there are two parts to their complaints. First, they allege that the eligibility requirements and age-based distinctions set out in legislation and regulations that govern disability savings plans are a discriminatory practice in the provision of a service under s.5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 (the Act). Second, they allege that Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) discriminated against them on the grounds of disability in the way it administered and promoted the RDSP (the \u201cadministration allegations\u201d). They say their complaints have always had these two elements to them.\n[2] The Respondent, ESDC, is the department of the Government of Canada that is responsible for developing, managing and delivering social programs and services. ESDC argues that it is not a service provider within the meaning of the Act in these complaints because a challenge to eligibility requirements set out in legislative instruments must be brought before the courts under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11. ESDC also denies that it is a service provider to individuals with disabilities who wish to open an RDSP because those services are provided by registered financial institutions.\n[3] ESDC filed a motion asking the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cthe Tribunal\u201d) to dismiss the complaints. First, it says that the complaints the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) referred to the Tribunal are impermissible challenges to legislation and regulatory instruments that are beyond the scope of the Act and that it is plain and obvious that they have no reasonable prospect of success. Second, it asks that the Tribunal strike the administration allegations because they are new and were added after the Commission referred the complaints to the Tribunal. ESDC says that allowing the administration allegations to proceed would prejudice it and would be an abuse of process that circumvents the system for human rights referrals set out in the Act.\n[4] The Commission initially took the legal position that the Regulations could be challenged before the Tribunal. The Commission reversed its position after it referred the complaints to the Tribunal and now agrees with ESDC that challenges to the non-discretionary Regulations at issue in these complaints do not fall within the scope of the Act. But the Commission says that the administration allegations are within the scope of the initial complaints it referred to the Tribunal and should proceed.\n[5] The Complainants filed a joint response to ESDC\u2019s motion. They largely agree with the Commission\u2019s submissions, though they added some individual aspects to their submissions. Some of the Complainants do not agree that a challenge to the Regulations is beyond the scope of the Act. They are asking the Tribunal to deny ESDC\u2019s request to strike their allegations because they say it would be in the public interest to proceed to hear them.\n[6] This motion requires me to first determine the nature and scope of the complaints that the Commission referred to the Tribunal. After deciding what these complaints are really about and how to characterize them, I can decide whether the Tribunal can proceed to hear them, in whole or in part.\n[7] In its response to the motion, the Commission added its own request, with no prior notice. It wants me to dismiss the motion and to decide whether the Tribunal can hear the Complainants\u2019 challenges to the Regulations on their merits as a preliminary issue. I am dismissing this request. I address this new issue below before turning to the substance of the motion.\nII. DECISION\n[8] I am allowing ESDC\u2019s motion and dismissing these complaints in their entirety. The complaints challenge mandatory age-based limitations in the statutory scheme for disability savings plans. The allegations target the substance of the legislation and the Regulations, and these non-discretionary entitlements are not a service held out by ESDC to the public. The Tribunal has no authority to award the payment of benefits or compensation. It is plain and obvious that these allegations have no reasonable prospect of success.\n[9] The administration allegations do not have a sufficient nexus to the complaints the Commission referred to the Tribunal. Allowing those to move forward would bypass the process for receiving and screening complaints set out in the Act and cause prejudice to ESDC.\nIII. STATUTORY CONTEXT OF DISABILITY SAVINGS PLANS\n[10] Before turning to the issues raised in the motion, I have outlined some of the legislative and regulatory framework that governs registered disability savings plans because it is relevant to how I have characterized these complaints.\n[11] The Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.1, s.146.4 (ITA), the CDSA and CDSR are the legal instruments that govern how registered disability savings plans work in Canada. Some eligibility requirements are set out in the ITA, but many are also included in the CDSA and in the CDSR.\n[12] RDSPs are registered savings plans intended to help support the long-term savings and financial security of Canadians with disabilities and their families. They are established under a provision of the ITA (s.146.4) and were first made available to disabled Canadians in 2008. They allow funds to grow tax-free in accounts that must be registered with the Canada Revenue Agency and opened through participating financial institutions. Contributions can be made until the end of the year an individual turns 59 and withdrawals must start at the age of 60 (s.146.4 of the ITA). These and other eligibility requirements are generally set out in s.146.4 of the ITA but are also found in the CDSA and CDSR.\n[13] The Government of Canada offers matching grants and bonds for low-income Canadians with disabilities that are paid directly into an RDSP. Canada Disability Savings Grants (\u201cgrants\u201d) and Canada Disability Savings Bonds (\u201cbonds\u201d) are established under the CDSA. The Government of Canada will pay a matching grant of 100%, 200% or 300% of an eligible individual\u2019s contributions, depending on the beneficiary\u2019s adjusted family net income and the amount contributed. These rules are set out in the CDSA and the CDSR (s.2). Bonds are additional amounts paid directly into the RDSP by the Government of Canada for low-income Canadians with disabilities. No contributions have to be made to receive the bond. Bonds can be up to $1000 a year with a lifetime bond limit of $20,000. Eligibility requirements for bonds are set out in the CDSA and the CDSR (s.3).\n[14] The CDSA also allows an individual to carry forward unused entitlements of grants and bonds from the previous 10 years, also known as an \u201callocation of contribution\u201d. These can be paid on contributions and bond requests made by a beneficiary up until December 31 of the year they turn 49. There are annual limits on carried forward grants and bonds and a lifetime grant limit. These provisions and the caps are set out in the CDSA.\nIV. ISSUES\n1. Should I determine whether challenges to the Regulations are within the scope of s.5 as a preliminary matter at a hearing instead of deciding the issue on this motion to strike?\n2. Are the complaints within the scope of the Act?\ni) Do the complaints challenge legislation and regulations? If so, do they also allege discrimination in how a service was provided to them?\nii) If the complaints are a challenge to legislation and regulations only, is it plain and obvious that the allegations have no reasonable prospect of success?\n3. Can the administration allegations proceed?\ni) Do the administration allegations have a sufficient link to the complaints that the Commission referred to the Tribunal?\nV. REASONS\n1. Should I determine whether challenges to the Regulations are within the scope of s.5 as a preliminary matter at a hearing instead of deciding the issue on this motion to strike?\n[15] No. I am rejecting the Commission\u2019s request to argue the same issues as a preliminary matter at a hearing. The request is wasteful of all parties\u2019 resources, including the Tribunal\u2019s. Deciding this issue by way of written motion is fair and efficient and favours the Tribunal\u2019s statutory obligation to conducts its proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow (s.48.9(1) of the Act).\n[16] The Tribunal has the authority to determine the scope of these complaints by way of motion to strike (Richards v Correctional Service Canada, 2020 CHRT 27 at para 85 [Richards]; Cushley et al. v. Veterans Affairs Canada, 2022 CHRT 21 at paras 16-18).\n[17] On a motion to strike, the Tribunal assumes the facts to be true, and evidence is not admissible. The Tribunal must exercise caution when striking a claim in advance of a hearing and must do so only in the \u201cclearest of cases\u201d (Richards at para 86). The approach must be generous and err on the side of permitting a novel but arguable claim to proceed (R. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd., 2011 SCC 42 at para 21). Even a complex and novel legal claim may properly be struck from a pleading if on a proper analysis of the law it is plain and obvious that the claim cannot succeed (Callan v. Cooke, 2012 BCSC 1589 at para 19).\n[18] The parties do not dispute that I have the authority to decide this motion to strike. Rather, in its response to the motion, the Commission asks that I hear the first issue raised by ESDC as a \u201cpreliminary matter\u201d on the merits instead. The Commission also reminds the Tribunal that it may \u201cuse flexibility to ensure fairness\u201d and that I can choose to conduct an oral hearing.\n[19] But the Commission has not explained what difference it could make to the outcome to decide what it describes as \u201ca purely legal question\u201d as a preliminary matter. While striking the allegations before a full hearing requires the higher standard of \u201cplain and obvious\u201d, it is up to ESDC to persuade me that the standard has been met. If I do not find that the allegations impugning the Regulations meet that higher threshold, I will dismiss ESDC\u2019s motion on this point, and we will proceed to a full hearing in any event.\n[20] If the Commission did not believe that it was plain and obvious that the allegations challenging the Regulations could not succeed, it could have made submissions countering ESDC\u2019s claim that these allegations have no reasonable prospect of success. Rather, the Commission agrees with ESDC that the Complainants must bring their challenge to the courts and that they are outside the ambit of the Act. It nevertheless wants the Tribunal to dismiss ESDC\u2019s motion, presumably so that the parties can make the same legal arguments again or repeat them orally at a hearing that no one asked for, albeit with a lower threshold for dismissing the allegations. It argues that doing so would be more efficient, recalling the Tribunal\u2019s obligations to proceed informally, expeditiously and fairly.\n[21] But holding a hearing or bifurcating the issues to determine the same question I can answer right now\u2014with hundreds of pages of Statements of Particulars (SOPs), motion materials and legal argument the Commission acknowledges I already have before me\u2014is at odds with the requirement for expediency and informality set out in s.48.9(1) of the Act. Further, the Commission\u2019s decision to raise this issue now\u2014for the first time\u2014undermines our collective efforts in case management, the purpose of which was to find efficient and fair ways of proceeding.\n[22] I have briefly outlined some of the procedural background and case management history in these complaints because it is relevant to my decision to reject the Commission\u2019s request and to proceed as previously agreed with the parties.\n[23] The Commission initially held Ms. Alkerton, Mr. Huntley and Mr. McGregor\u2019s complaints in abeyance pending the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada (\u201cthe Court\u201d) in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 31 [Andrews\/Matson]. In Andrews\/Matson, the Court determined that the alleged adverse impacts arising exclusively from legislation do not engage a service customarily available to the public.\n[24] The Commission decided to refer the complaints to the Tribunal because Andrews\/Matson did not address challenges to regulations. They were referred together as a single inquiry. When the Commission referred Mr. Dorey\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal, the parties consented to joining it because it had common factual and legal issues with the other complaints.\n[25] Early on in case management, ESDC raised the preliminary issue of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to hear complaints that challenge legislative and regulatory provisions. At that point the Commission indicated that its position was now that Andrews\/Matson applies to the non-discretionary Regulations at issue in these complaints. After the parties filed their SOPs, ESDC added a second preliminary issue. It said that the administration allegations were beyond the scope of the complaints the Commission referred to the Tribunal and should not be allowed to proceed.\n[26] I worked with the parties in case management to determine how to efficiently and fairly address the two issues ESDC raised. After hearing from the parties, I set deadlines for ESDC\u2019s motion to strike, and for responses, and replies.\n[27] Before the Commission filed its response to this motion, neither the Commission nor the complainants were opposed to proceeding by way of motion to strike filed by ESDC. No one asked to make oral submissions or to argue these legal issues at a merits hearing rather than making written submissions on whether the allegations could be struck. When the Tribunal sent a summary of the October 12, 2022, case management conference call (CMCC) that included deadlines for the filing of written motion materials, the Commission did not object to the way I characterised the process or argue that the Tribunal should bifurcate the issues and decide the merits of the issue or hear oral submissions.\n[28] Administrative tribunals are masters in their own house. They can be flexible, provided the processes they establish are fair. \u201cThe aim is not to create \u2018procedural\u2019 perfection but to achieve a certain balance between the need for fairness, efficiency and predictability of outcome.\u201d (Knight v Indian Head School Division No. 19, 1990 CanLii 138 (SCC), [1990] 1 SCR 653 at p.685, citing de Smith\u2019s Judicial Review of Administrative Action, (4th ed., (1980), at p.240)).\n[29] Postponing my decision on this question serves no one. I am not prepared to dismiss the motion and to require the parties to spend more time and resources to repeat their arguments as a \u201cpreliminary issue\u201d at a merits hearing. I find no basis for deferring this question any further.\n[30] The parties have had ample opportunity to argue whether the complaints can proceed in their motion materials and have made many of the same points in their SOPs. Until the Commission raised it in its response to this motion, the Complainants had not expressed a concern about proceeding in writing by way of a motion to strike. They have ably and articulately participated throughout the case management process and coordinated written submissions on this motion. It is not clear why delaying the determination of these questions would be fairer to them or to any of the parties, particularly since in the Commission\u2019s own words, this is a \u201cpurely legal question\u201d.\n[31] I find no compromise between fairness and efficiency in deciding the issue now. Delaying a decision on this issue is unfair not only for the parties to these complaints who will spend more resources and time preparing to address the very same issue as a \u201cpreliminary matter\u201d, but also to parties in other cases who are waiting for their files to progress. Granting the Commission\u2019s request would divert some of the Tribunal\u2019s scarce resources away from other cases, which would also contribute to institutional delay. There is no basis for doing so when I can fully and fairly address the issue right now for these parties.\n[32] Administrative tribunals also have an obligation to use their resources efficiently. Parliament chose to delegate decision-making in specialized areas such as human rights to administrative tribunals and expects them to proceed expeditiously and efficiently (Law Society of Saskatchewan v. Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29 at paras 46 and 64).\n[33] The Commission also argues that I should determine this issue as a preliminary matter\u2014and possibly allow for oral submissions\u2014because a ruling on this issue is in the public interest, will provide some finality for the Complainants, is significant for them, and will provide guidance for future complaints that raise similar issues. But the Commission has not explained why my decision on the motion could not do the same thing. I am deciding the very questions that the Complainants\u2014and all the parties\u2014have asked me to answer, namely: can these complaints move forward in our process, in whole or in part? This ruling gives the parties finality even if it is not the answer that the Complainants were hoping for.\n[34] If there has not been a Tribunal determination of the specific issue of challenges to regulations since Andrews\/Matson, then this ruling will be the first. But that would also be the case if I were to decide this same issue as a preliminary matter at a hearing as the Commission suggests. If the Commission thought that something would change at a hearing when applying a lower standard than the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d threshold to dismiss a complaint before a hearing, it has not articulated what that would be. Rather than telling me why these complaints do have a reasonable prospect of success and should proceed, the Commission has agreed with ESDC that the challenges to the Regulations are outside the scope of the Act and that the principles developed in Andrews\/Matson apply to these complaints.\n[35] Finally, the Commission argues that ESDC\u2019s motion is an impermissible collateral attack on its decision to refer these complaints to the Tribunal and that ESDC should have sought judicial review of the decisions to refer.\n[36] ESDC says that it is not asking the Commission to overturn its referral decision. Rather, it is asking the Tribunal to determine the merits of the complaints based on a preliminary motion because it believes the complaints have no reasonable prospect of a success. It says that this is squarely the job of the Tribunal. The Commission performs a screening function. Its referral decision is water under the bridge.\n[37] I agree. Regardless of what the Commission determined through its investigation and referral process, it is the Tribunal\u2019s task to adjudicate the merits of a complaint, including whether the allegations have any reasonable prospect of success.\n[38] The Tribunal clearly has the authority to address the issues raised by ESDC in this motion to strike. It can also control its own process, as long as the process is fair. I am determining these issues by way of written motion materials because this is the most efficient way to proceed in these complaints, as discussed with all the parties in case management. I see no need for oral submissions that no one requested, nor has the Commission persuaded me that doing so is required to \u201censure fairness\u201d.\n2. Are the complaints within the scope of the Act?\n[39] To establish whether the allegations are within the scope of the Act, I must first characterize the complaints and determine what actions or practice they impugn.\n[40] Not everything done by someone working for or with the Government of Canada is a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s.5 of the Act, and I must look at the source of the alleged discrimination (see Watkin v Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 170 [Watkin] at paras 24-33 and Forward v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 5 [Forward] at paras 37-38).\n[41] If a respondent that provides services customarily available to the general public does so in a way that effectively denies access or makes an adverse differentiation based on a prohibited ground, the complaint could fall within s.5 of the Act. But if a respondent is applying legislated criteria, the challenge is not to the provision of services but to the legislation itself (Andrews\/Matson at para 97, citing Murphy, at para 6).\n[42] I have considered each of the complaints in turn because, while they have similarities, I must consider each Complainant\u2019s allegations individually to determine whether the actions complained of are truly \u201cservices\u201d within the meaning of the Act. In other words, what is the behaviour or practice that the Complainants say was discriminatory? Was it the way they were treated by ESDC staff? Do they suggest that ESDC applied the law in a discriminatory manner? Was it the fact that they were denied benefits because of the age cut-offs found in the legislation and the regulations? Are the Complainants really taking issue with the relevant laws and Regulations?\ni) Do the complaints challenge legislation and regulations? If so, do they also allege discrimination in how a service was provided to them?\n[43] In my view, these complaints all challenge the relevant legislative and regulatory framework. All four Complainants take issue with age-based distinctions and the eligibility criteria set out in the CDSA, the ITA and under ss. 2 and 3 of the CDSR. They say it is unfair that 49 is the cut-off age for grants and bonds under the CDSA and the Regulations. Some of the complaints also challenge the carry-forward and retroactivity provisions set out in the CDSA. Further they all seek as remedies the payment of benefits they were not entitled to under the existing statutory scheme, and some hope that the legislation or Regulations could be changed. They do not allege discrimination in how a service was provided to them.\n[44] I have set out below the details of the four complaints and the Commission\u2019s Report for Decision. Despite some differences in their complaints, my conclusion is the same for all. Whether or not the Complainants cited the grounds of age and disability, or just age, the essence of all the complaints is the fact that they were treated differently than other individuals due to the mandatory wording found in the relevant Regulations and legislative provisions.\nJames Dorey\n[45] Mr. Dorey opened an RDSP with the Toronto Dominion Bank in 2019. Once his RDSP was registered, the Canada Disability Savings Program determined his eligibility for bonds and grants for 2019 and the previous 10 years, going back to 2009. He received a total of $1,041.12 in bonds for 2012 and 2013 because in those years he fell under the income thresholds under the CDSA and CDSR. He was eligible to receive grants in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and received a total of $31,500 of matching grants based on his yearly contributions under the terms of the statutory scheme. As Mr. Dorey is over 49 years of age, he is no longer eligible for grants and bonds. The money in his RDSP will continue to grow tax-free, but he will need to begin to withdraw those funds when he turns 60.\n[46] Mr. Dorey filed his complaint with the Commission on February 28, 2020, when he was 48 years old, alleging discrimination on the basis of age. In his complaint, he notes that he will cease to be eligible for grants and bonds as of December 31, 2021, the year in which he turned 49 years of age. He takes issue with the fact that as of that date, he would no longer be able to take advantage of any retroactivity or carry forward. Due to the caps on grant amounts that can be paid in any given year, he cannot use his entire carry-forward amount to take advantage of the matching grants before losing his eligibility at the age of 49.\n[47] In its Report for Decision, the Commission described Mr. Dorey\u2019s complaint as follows:\n2. \u2026[T]he complainant alleges that certain provisions of the Canada Disability Savings Regulations (CDSR) are discriminatory based on age. He alleges that the respondent is discriminating against him by denying him matching grants and bonds, available to the beneficiaries of the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP), because the respondent limits the eligibility of the plan to persons less than 49 years of age\u2026\n31. The complainant alleges that the respondent is using the age-based restrictions in the CDSRs to deny him services and that this is discriminatory.\n45. The crux of this present complaint seeks to challenge regulations and not the nondiscretionary application of legislation passed by Parliament\u2026\nKarolin Alkerton\n[48] Ms. Alkerton opened an RDSP through TD Waterhouse in 2017. She was 53 years of age at the time. She was found to be ineligible for grants and bonds because she was over the age of 49. She filed her complaint in January 2018, but her complaint was held in abeyance at the Commission pending the outcome of the Andrews\/Matson decision. In her complaint, Ms. Alkerton explains that when she applied for the RDSP, an ESDC agent told her that she was not eligible for any grants or bonds because she was over the age of 49. She alleges this is discriminatory on the ground of age.\n[49] In its Report for Decision, the Commission described Ms. Alkerton\u2019s complaint as follows:\n2. \u2026[T]he complainant alleges that certain provisions of the Canada Disability Savings Regulations (CDSR) are discriminatory based on age. She alleges that the respondent discriminated against her by refusing to provide her with the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) carry forward grants and bonds, available to the beneficiaries of the RDSP, because the respondent limits the eligibility of the plan to persons less than 49 years of age\u2026\n33. The complainant alleges that the respondent is using the age-based restrictions in the CDSRs to deny her services and that this is discriminatory.\n49. The crux of this present complaint seeks to challenge regulations and not the non-discretionary application of legislation passed by Parliament.\n56. The complainant states that the age restriction is discriminatory because it suggests that individuals living with disabilities have a limited lifespan. She alleges that the use of the age 49 as the cut-off is arbitrary and does not take into account the individual\u2019s specific circumstances\u2026[A]t the time the respondent introduced the CDSP she would have been 44 years of age and would have been eligible for the benefit; however, she was not aware of the program until 2017. She states that there is no retroactive mechanism in the CDSP like under the DTC regime.\nRoderick McGregor\n[50] Mr. McGregor became disabled at the age of 48 and opened an RDSP in 2018, when he was 53 years of age. He states that, when he was 48 and 49 years of age, he was fully to partially incapacitated and that he believes the discrimination happened to him because of his disability. He was not eligible for grants and bonds because he was over 49 years of age and says that, when he opened an RDSP at his financial institution, he was told that he could not receive the matching grant and bond components using the 10-year carry-forward provisions because he applied past his 49th birthday.\n[51] Mr. McGregor argues that it is discriminatory on the grounds of disability \u201cwhen the individual is not provided the same reasonable interval as others (who were disabled well before age 49 and had ample time to react and apply), to discover the RDSP benefits and deadline limitations because it coincides with incapacity period associated with that very disability.\u201d\n[52] In its Report for Decision, the Commission described Mr. McGregor\u2019s complaint as follows:\n2. \u2026[T]he complainant alleges that certain provisions of the Canada Disability Savings Regulations (CDSR) are discriminatory based on age. He alleges that the respondent discriminated against him by refusing to provide him with the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) carry forward grants and bonds, available to the beneficiaries of the RDSP, because the respondent limits the eligibility of the plan to persons less than 49 years of age. He further alleges that the respondent is discriminating against those individuals, like himself, who become disabled later in life and cannot apply and contribute before the age restriction takes effect.\n33. The complainant alleges that the respondent is using the age-based restrictions in the CDSRs to deny him services and that this is discriminatory.\n49. The crux of this present complaint seeks to challenge regulations and not the non-discretionary application of legislation passed by Parliament\u2026\nDavid Huntley\n[53] Mr. Huntley opened an RDSP in 2015 and was assessed for the previous 10 years. He received the maximum annual cap in grants for the years 2008 to 2014 as well as a bond. Mr. Huntley stopped being eligible for grants and bonds after 2015, the year he turned 49 years of age. He filed his complaint with the Commission in 2016, but the Commission held it in abeyance pending the Andrews\/Matson cases which were proceeding through the courts. He described the Canada Disability Savings Program as complex and confusing.\n[54] In its Report for Decision, the Commission described Mr. Huntley\u2019s complaint as follows:\n2. Specifically, the complainant alleges that certain provisions of the Canada Disability Savings Regulations (CDSR) are discriminatory based on age. He alleges that the respondent discriminated against him by refusing to provide him with the matching grants, available to the beneficiaries of the RDSP, because the respondent limits the eligibility of the plan to persons less than 49 years of age. He further alleges that the use of the age 49 is arbitrary.\n33. The complainant alleges that the respondent is using the age-based restrictions in the CDSRs to deny him services and that this is discriminatory.\n49. The crux of this present complaint seeks to challenge regulations and not the non-discretionary application of legislation passed by Parliament.\n55. The complainant states that he is living with a disability and that the respondent is discriminating against him solely based on his birth year. He states that he would benefit from the program.\n56. The complainant states that the age restriction is discriminatory because if he was younger he would receive more income.\n[55] As the Commission submits, deciding whether a regulation, legislative provision or other provision falls within the definition of a s. 5 service, requires an individualized assessment of the allegations in a complaint and the act, action or activity in question. I am not bound by how the Complainants and the Commission characterized their complaints.\n[56] The Complainants argue that the Canadian Disability Savings Program (\u201cthe Program\u201d) is a service administered by ESDC under their mandate to \u201cdeliver programs and services to each and every Canadian throughout their lives in a significant capacity\u201d.\n[57] But the Complainants do not claim that they were not paid benefits to which they were entitled under the ITA, CDSA or CDSR, or that ESDC exercised its discretion to withhold those benefits that is in some way linked to a prohibited ground. They do not allege that someone treated them in a discriminatory manner or denied them a service because of a protected characteristic, whether disability or age. Rather, they take issue with the fact that ESDC staff used criteria that the legislation and regulations obligated them to apply.\n[58] The complaints do not claim that the legislation or regulations could have been interpreted in a non-discriminatory manner, though they appear to argue that ESDC could have exercised some discretion in applying the rules. This is to be distinguished from the situation in Beattie v. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2014 CHRT 1 [Beattie]) where the respondent had the option of interpreting the legislation that was most consistent with human rights principles. In Beattie, the respondent initially denied the service on the basis of legislation but then later accepted the complainant\u2019s interpretation. The ability to grant the core remedy without modifying the existing legislation distinguished the case from Andrews\/Matson and these complaints. Here the Complainants do not allege that ESDC misinterpreted legislation or regulatory provisions. Rather, the essence of their complaints is a challenge to the text of the provisions themselves.\n[59] The complaints the Commission referred were not directed at the conduct of ministerial officials, the exercise of discretion, or the implementation of departmental policies and practices (Forward, at para 37). As the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) held in Watkin, the fact that actions are undertaken by a public body for the public good cannot transform what is ostensibly not a service into one (Watkin at para 33).\n[60] While Mr. Huntley and others refer at times to the complexity of the system or to a difficult application process, they do not allege that this is the reason that they lost their eligibility or explain how an adverse impact is connected to their disability or age. Rather, the Complainants challenge the Regulations, which is the \u201ccrux of their complaints\u201d as the Commission described in each of their Reports for Decision. They dispute the provisions that made them ineligible for grants and bonds after turning 49 years of age or that limited other entitlements they may have enjoyed but for those statutory or regulatory caps.\n[61] But as ESDC submits, all public servants must base their actions in the law, and their authority comes from the statutes and regulations that ESDC administers. There is no authority to pay benefits not provided in statutes or regulations.\n[62] In light of my finding that the source of the alleged discrimination in these complaints is the legislative and regulatory framework, I must now decide if these allegations are within the scope of the Act and have any reasonable prospect of success.\nii) If the complaints are a challenge to legislation and regulations only, is it plain and obvious that the allegations have no reasonable prospect of success?\n[63] Yes. It is well established that the Tribunal does not have the jurisdiction to decide complaints that are challenges to legislation. Section 5 of the Act requires that services customarily available to the general public be provided in a non-discriminatory manner (Beattie at para 102]. However, law-making is not a service customarily offered to the public and legislation does not in and of itself constitute a \u201cservice\u201d (Andrews\/Matson at paras 57-62).\n[64] To the extent that some of the complainants continue to challenge provisions of the CDSA or other legislation, these allegations clearly fall outside the scope of the Act and must be dismissed.\n[65] Similarly, I find that the Complainants\u2019 challenges to the Regulations have no reasonable prospect of success and cannot proceed.\n[66] The Commission submits that the general principles underlying Andrews\/Matson and other case law about complaints that challenge mandatory entitlement provisions in legislation are equally applicable to the Regulations.\n[67] I agree. Just as the Tribunal dismissed the complaints in Andrews\/Matson as direct attacks on legislation, the Complainants argue that the Regulations themselves are discriminatory. They do not claim that a service was being delivered in an unequal way, but rather dispute the fact that they could not access grants and bonds or take advantage of other benefits due to non-discretionary age-based requirements found in the Regulations. In my view, the making of the Regulations at issue in these complaints does not have the transitive connotation necessary to identify as a service customarily offered to the public [Andrews\/Matson at para 62].\n[68] The Complainants are not challenging the way ESDC processed their applications but substantively targeted the eligibility criteria that the Respondent had no choice but to apply. The source of the alleged discrimination is the Regulations themselves.\n[69] Although I find that the analysis in Andrews\/Matson is applicable to the Regulations at issue in these complaints, ESDC has also relied on authorities that predate the Court\u2019s finding with respect to law-making. In my view, these authorities provide further support for the conclusion that a challenge to the Regulations does not engage a service. This is not the first time that the Tribunal and the courts have considered this question, and I find no basis to diverge from this approach in the complaints.\n[70] In Bouvier the FCA upheld the motions judge\u2019s finding that the Commission had no jurisdiction to consider, inquire into and refer challenges to the Railway Vision and Hearing Examination Regulations (Canada (Attorney General) v. Bouvier, 1998 CanLii 7409 (FCA) at paras 1 and 4-5). In Murphy the FCA upheld the Federal Court and the Tribunal\u2019s finding that a challenge to the Unemployment Insurance Act and its Regulations \u201cdoes not come within any of the practices that may form the object of a complaint under the CHRA\u201d (Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Revenue Agency), 2012 FCA 7. Finally, in Mishibinjimi, the FCA held that the Act does not contain a provision equivalent to s.47(2) of the Ontario Human Rights Code which expressly permits challenges to acts and regulations (Mishibinijima v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 36 at para 40).\n[71] ESDC also submits that the courts have held that regulations are part of the law-making process and that the promulgation of regulations by the executive is a legislative act. It relies on Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation, in which the Court held that \u201cthe legislature has the authority to enact laws on its own and the authority to delegate to some other person or body certain administrative or regulator powers, including the power to make binding but subordinate rules and regulations\u201d (Reference re Pan\u2011Canadian Securities Regulation, 2018 SCC 48 (CanLII), [2018] 3 SCR 189) at para 73). The Court goes on to say that this is sometimes referred to as a \u201csubordinate law-making power\u201d and that statutory schemes often merely set out the basic objects of the legislature, such that \u201cmost of the heavy lifting [gets] done by regulations, adopted by the executive branch of government under orders-in-council\u201d (Pan-Canadian, citing (B. McLachlin, P.C., Administrative Tribunals and the Courts: An Evolutionary Relationship, May 27, 2013 (online), see also Hogg (5th ed.), at pp. 14-1 and 14-2) at para 73).\n[72] In the RDSP framework, the regulations do some of the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d and contain the details about eligibility, without which the disability savings scheme could not be implemented or operationalized. While the age-based requirements are found in the CDSR and not in an Act of Parliament, I accept that the power to enact them has been delegated by the legislature and that these are \u201cbinding but subordinate rules and regulations\u201d as the Court described the regulations in Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation.\n[73] The source of the authority to enact the CDSR also supports the finding that a challenge to the Regulations is not a service. The Regulations are made under the terms of their governing legislation, the CDSA, which provides that \u201c[t]he Governor in Council may make regulations for carrying out the purpose and provisions of this Act.\u201d (s.17, CDSA). Section 17 of the CDSA enumerates a non-exhaustive list of what the Regulations may provide, including establishing requirements that must be met by a registered disability savings plan before grants or bonds may be paid in respect of the plan, the manner of determining the amounts of the grants and bonds, and regulations governing the repayment of those amounts.\n[74] In my view, it would lead to an absurd result if only a complaint targeting the legislation (the CDSA or ITA in these complaints) was considered outside the Tribunal\u2019s scope to decide, whereas a challenge to the Regulations enacted by virtue of that same legislation, without which the purpose and intentions of Parliament could not be carried out, was considered within the Tribunal\u2019s ambit and a \u201cservice\u201d customarily available to the public. Parliament intended to delegate this authority to enact Regulations, which derives from the CDSA, and the regulatory provisions complete the statutory scheme to carry out the system of eligibility for disability savings plans. I also find the FCA\u2019s guidance in Bouvier relevant to my analysis, namely that a government department\u2014in this case ESDC\u2014cannot be held accountable for a regulation \u201csimply because it has been given by Parliament the responsibility of administering the Act on the authority of which the Regulation was validly enacted by the Governor in Council\u201d (Bouvier at para 4).\n[75] The Complainants argue that if I apply the Andrews\/Matson line of reasoning to the Regulations, I would be sheltering the operations of federal administrative entities like ESDC. They submit that while the making of legislation is subject to extensive checks and balances in our democratic systems, regulations, which were not mentioned at all in Andrews\/Matson, are authored by the non-elected executive. They argue that applying the reasoning in Andrews\/Matson to regulation-making could create an incentive for parliamentarians and government actors to load up controversial human rights aspects of a policy to regulations to shield them from scrutiny under s.5 of the Act. They argue that this would represent a setback for human rights and was not the intended consequence of Andrews\/Matson.\n[76] But as ESDC argues, the Regulations are not authored by non-elected executive with less democratic checks and balances, as the Complainants submit. The Regulations were enacted by the Governor in Council, made up of the executive level of government (the Prime Minister and the Cabinet), who are elected and accountable to Canadians. Further, the authority to enact those Regulations was delegated by Parliament in the enabling legislation. This is not a situation where arbitrary rules were set up without any authority and that adversely impact persons possessing a particular characteristic.\n[77] The Regulations may reflect policy choices with which the Complainants disagree, but it is not the Tribunal\u2019s task to second-guess the choices made by the Governor in Council. I have no authority to change the Regulations created through \u201csubordinate law-making power\u201d in these complaints, just as I have no authority to amend laws enacted by the legislature. I also cannot order the benefits to be paid contrary to the relevant law or Regulations.\n[78] I empathize with the Complainants\u2019 frustration that they cannot challenge the legislative framework before this Tribunal. They have spoken and written about aspects of the Program they find unfair and difficult to access. But I cannot make an order to change the system created by Parliament. To do so would be to exceed my own authority and would be an error in law. As the Commission argues, the Complainants must pursue their challenge to these provisions before the courts.\n[79] For these reasons, it is plain and obvious that the allegations impugning the legislative framework and eligibility criteria, found in both legislation and the Regulations, have no reasonable prospect of success and must be dismissed.\n3. Can the administration allegations proceed? [80] Complaints can evolve. The evolution must still respect the essence of the complaint, however, and cannot introduce a substantially new complaint that was not considered by the Commission (Canada (Attorney General) v First Nations Child and Family Caring Society of Canada, 2021 FC 969 at para 215 [Caring Society] and Casler v. Canadian National Railway, 2017 CHRT 6, paras. 7\u201311).\n[81] The scope of a complaint is determined not just by the complaint form, but also by the SOPs which serve the function of pleadings in CHRA proceedings (Caring Society at para 153). The substance of the SOP must reasonably respect the factual foundation and original allegations of discrimination as set out in the original complaint (Karas v. Canadian Blood Services and Health Canada, 2021 CHRT 2 at para 24; Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28 at paras 69-70).\ni) Do the administration allegations have a sufficient link to the complaints that the Commission referred to the Tribunal? [82] No. The Commission referred complaints that challenge the age limits and retroactivity provisions in the Regulations. The administration allegations appeared for the first time in the Commission and the Complainant\u2019s SOPs, when the Commission began to characterize these complaints as having two components, namely allegations about how ESDC promoted and administered the RDSP, in addition to the challenges to the Regulations that were the essence of the complaints the Commission referred.\n[83] In the four SOPs the Commission filed in these complaints, the Commission alleges that the complainants had difficulty accessing the Program due to, among other things, \u201cCanada\u2019s discretionary program design choices and actions\u201d, a complex, multilayered application process, inadequate publicity of the Program, lack of communication and, more generally, delays in what was described as an onerous application process.\n[84] The Commission also claims that the complaints involve systemic discrimination. It says that there is clear and consistent evidence that persons with disabilities were disproportionately negatively impacted by ESDC\u2019s design and delivery of the Canada Disability Savings Program and that their inability to fully participate in the program increased their level of marginalization and financial disadvantage. It states that a large majority of eligible Canadians living with disabilities aged 18 to 49 did not apply for a savings plan or grants and bonds between 2008 and 2016.\n[85] In Mr. Huntley\u2019s SOP, he alleges that ESDC and the government have made the application process cumbersome and weighty for disabled and non-disabled persons and that the Government of Canada and ESDC already knew through the Canada Revenue Agency who qualified so that there was no need for this complexity. He states that there was low uptake, total confusion as to how to apply and that Andrews\/Matson is now being used as a carte blanche to avoid disputes about government services.\n[86] In her SOP, Ms. Alkerton references her disability but largely takes issue with the fact that she cannot benefit from grants and bonds due to \u201crestrictions inherent in the program\u201d, noting the age restrictions and that a financial officer at her financial institution did not have much information. She too described the application process as complex and not well promoted. She argues there is no benefit to opening the RDSP because there are not the same benefits as there are for those under 49.\n[87] Mr. McGregor\u2019s SOP alleges discrimination on the grounds of disability because he could not access benefits as this coincided with a period of incapacity due to his disability. He claims that the system of grants and bonds and the carry-forward provisions discriminate against those who experience a disability or trauma later in life and closer to the age of 49.\n[88] Mr. Dorey writes in his SOP that when he learned about RDSPs he contacted his bank and investment manager and found it difficult to get information. He refers to the age-based limitations and its impact on retroactivity, and on caps for grants and bonds. He goes on to say that when \u201cyou apply the exact same policies to two different people, one being 36 and one being 46, despite the situation being identical in every other respect, based on AGE ALONE, these two people are receiving different benefits and that is discriminatory based on the prohibitive grounds of age\u201d.\n[89] The complainants and the Commission submit that the complaints filed with the Commission always included the administration allegations. The Commission argues that the allegation that the administration of the Program is discriminatory is a \u201ccore aspect of each complainant\u2019s experience of discrimination\u201d.\n[90] I do not accept this characterization. To the extent that the administration allegations are anything more than challenges to the eligibility requirements now termed allegations about the \u201cadministration\u201d of the Program, they cannot proceed because they do not have a sufficient connection to what the Commission referred to the Tribunal. While the Complainants, and in particular Mr. Huntley, may have written about the Program being confusing and hard to apply to and understand, that is not the essence of their complaints, nor what the Commission chose to refer.\n[91] The Commission relies on Tribunal cases that stand for the proposition that it is not obligated to investigate or scrutinize every aspect of a complaint nor to amend a complaint before referring it to the Tribunal (Connors v Canadian Armed Forces, 2019 CHRT 6 at paras 39-40; Jorge v Canada Post Corporation, 2021 CHRT 25 [Jorge]). The Commission argues that the SOPs elaborate upon and complete the complaints and set the scope of the hearing. It denies ESDC\u2019s claim that the screening process has been circumvented by what it characterizes as \u201cdetails\u201d provided in the Commission and the Complainants\u2019 SOPs. It also relies on Letnes v Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2019 CHRT 41 at para 5 [Letnes] in claiming that human rights proceedings are open to refinement as new facts and circumstances come to light and that amendments may be allowed at any stage to ensure they properly and fairly reflect the issues in dispute between the parties to a complaint. It argues that the administration allegations, far from opening a new and unanticipated route of inquiry, elaborate on previously raised allegations.\n[92] I do not accept the Commission\u2019s submissions on this point. This is not a situation where a detail or peripheral aspect that was not scrutinized has been added to the SOPs. ESDC argues that the allegations in the SOPs are vague and suffer from other issues as set out below. But in my view the fundamental problem is that they open a whole other line of inquiry about ESDC\u2019s alleged failures to promote or properly administer the RDSP that discriminates against the Complainants on the grounds of disability. The Commission claims the complaints include systemic allegations of discrimination that impact persons with disabilities writ large. These are very broad claims. But these are not the complaints that the Commission referred to the Tribunal.\n[93] The Commission states that there is no abuse of process in allowing the administration allegations because the SOPs set out the \u201centirety of the allegations against ESDC stemming from the complaints filed by the complainants\u201d. Even if that were the case, that is not the point. The point is not whether the SOPs are \u201ccomplete\u201d. It is whether the administration allegations, set out in the SOPs, have a sufficient nexus to the complaints the Commission referred. In my view the SOPs open up a new and unanticipated route of inquiry and should not be allowed (Gaucher v. Canada (Armed Forces), 2005 CHRT 1, cited in Letnes, at para 8).\n[94] The Commission argues that ESDC\u2019s submissions are based on a misunderstanding of the Commission\u2019s role pre-referral versus that of the Tribunal. It relies on Jorge where the Tribunal explained that the complaint form is an overview of the complaint and that it need not be a complete recitation of an extended series of perceived discrimination, given the limitation of space for content and the fact that parties may be self-represented. The complaint form is not a pleading and is not intended to be strictly or narrowly interpreted. Expecting precise details at the time of the original complaint may unfairly prejudice the complainant (Jorge at paras 67 to 83].\n[95] These submissions about the fundamental roles of the Commission and the Tribunal do not assist in the circumstances. There is no dispute that the Commission must investigate complaints and decide whether to refer them and that, once referred, the Tribunal conducts an inquiry into the complaint that was referred. But the Tribunal cannot hear complaints that are not sufficiently related to what the Commission sent its way, nor open up a new avenue of allegations that appear for the first time at the Tribunal.\n[96] Further, the facts and circumstances in Jorge are distinguishable. While the Tribunal allowed the proposed amendments in Jorge, the Tribunal found that the facts were part of the storyline of the complaint\u2019s narrative and that they constituted \u201cmore of the same\u201d alleged facts, namely additional examples of the same type of discriminatory practice(s) that were identified in the complaint (Jorge at para 100).\n[97] I do not find that the administration allegations are \u201cmore of the same\u201d. They do not constitute new examples of additional facts that complete or build on the history of what occurred. As set out above, the crux of the complaints the Commission referred was the challenge to the age-based limitations in the Regulations. The administration allegations are not part of that same story and are not merely \u201crefining\u201d what amounts to an attack on Regulations.\n[98] The Commission submits that the Complainants are all persons with disabilities and that all made references to disability in their complaint form and during the investigation. But mentioning that they are persons with disabilities\u2014which is not contested\u2014does not define the essence of the complaint. Other than baldly asserting that the administration allegations were part of the original complaints, the Commission does not substantiate its claim that there is a sufficient nexus to the original complaints. Rather, as reproduced above, the crux of these complaints was a challenge to the Regulations, which at the time the Commission believed were allegations the Tribunal could hear.\n[99] While Ms. Alkerton may have written that the Program was \u201cdesigned and supposed to be offered to a person with an eligible disability\u201d, I accept ESDC\u2019s submission that what she takes issue with are the eligibility requirements, writing that \u201cage restrictions are what present the barrier and discriminate based on my age\u201d. Similarly, while Mr. McGregor became disabled later in life and alleges that he was discriminated against on the grounds of disability because he could not apply while he was incapacitated, it is the statutory scheme that has limited his eligibility. In the case of Mr. Huntley, his original complaint did describe the Program as \u201ccomplex and confusing\u201d, but he did not particularize how this is related to his disability. Even if I accept the Commission\u2019s argument that disability was implicit as a ground, that is not sufficient to link these allegations to the original complaints, which were about a challenge to the Regulations.\n[100] It is conceivable that the Complainants could have alleged they were adversely impacted by the way a service was delivered or by virtue of actions taken by ESDC in its administration and promotion of the Program, but that is not what the Commission referred.\n[101] Far from being \u201cpart of the same storyline\u201d, the Commission is attempting to take the unchallenged fact that the Complainants are all persons with disabilities and use that to draw a nexus from the administration allegations to the complaints they actually referred.\n[102] I have also considered the remedies sought by the Complainants with a view to determining whether the administration allegations are within the scope of what the complaints the Commission referred. I accept ESDC\u2019s submission that the remedies that all of the Complainants seek are for the payment of benefits. They would like to see the CDSA and CDSR changed to entitle them to the grants they could have received. Mr. Dorey seeks amendments to relevant provisions, including ongoing retroactivity or reverse eligibility that cannot cease or be revoked, the ability for an individual to purchase the full amount, and he also wants to ensure that contributors can withdraw money penalty-free whenever they desire.\n[103] Ms. Alkerton is asking that the maximum lifetime cap of grants and bonds be paid to reflect the full ten years since the inception of the RDSP Program and for her time spent pursuing the complaint.\n[104] Mr. McGregor is seeking $2,000 in grants for the years he was 48 and 49, in addition to general and special damages. He calls for systemic changes to the RDSP Program to change the carry forward provisions and age-related constraints.\n[105] Finally, while Mr. Huntley refers to \u2018the policy and wording being changed\u2019, what he is seeking is an amendment to the regulatory provisions so that he and others can carry forward bond and grant application entitlement up to age 49 but from an application submission date after age 49 up to the age limit or carry forward time limit, whichever comes first. He also asks for $2,000 in bonds to be paid.\n[106] I agree with ESDC that these remedies target the statutory age limits and ask me to order the payment of benefits the Complainants were not entitled to. These are not remedies tied to allegations about something other than challenges to the legislative and regulatory framework. In seeking the lifetime maximum cap of grants and bonds, Ms. Alkerton is challenging the Regulations and her ineligibility for grants and bonds. Mr. McGregor\u2019s remedial requests similarly show how his complaint is about the Regulations themselves, and Mr. Huntley is explicitly seeking amendments to the text of the provisions. Finally, while Mr. Dorey\u2019s requests relate to the wording of the CDSA and the Regulations, he also seeks a remedy relating to the promotion of the Program, though this necessarily entails third parties. He includes a letter from his financial advisor, but this only raises concerns related to his financial advisor and TD Bank and does not impugn ESDC.\n[107] I also do not accept the Commission\u2019s claim that allowing the administration allegations to proceed would not cause any prejudice to ESDC. The administration allegations do not elaborate on the challenges to age-based eligibility requirements in the Regulations.\n[108] I agree with ESDC\u2019s statement that these complaints have proceeded in a very unusual manner. The Commission argues that the administration allegations should proceed, while at the same time submitting that they are connected to complaints which they say cannot be pursued before this Tribunal. The Commission may well believe this is what they referred to us, but I need to satisfy myself of the Tribunal\u2019s ability to proceed. Bald statements that the administration allegations were a \u201ccore aspect of each complainant\u2019s experience of discrimination\u201d are not sufficient to draw a nexus or to bring these administration allegations within the four corners of the initial complaints.\n[109] Allowing these allegations to proceed would prejudice ESDC. The administration allegations are not connected in fact and law to the complaints the Commission referred. This is unfair and the prejudice to ESDC cannot be cured as ESDC was not able to anticipate or present its arguments before the Commission and exhaust the mechanisms provided for under the Act, such as applying for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s actions and decisions or asking the Commission not to deal with the complaint (Karas, at 140).\n[110] The Commission submits that there is no prejudice to ESDC as it has been aware for years about problems with the promotion of the Program and that Mr. Huntley and Mr. McGregor mention disability in their complaints. It also says that the SOPs address the entirety of the complainants\u2019 and the Commission\u2019s allegations in any event.\n[111] I also cannot bypass the existing framework for human rights complaints, simply out of expediency. It is an error in law and does not respect the legislative framework and the respective role of the Commission and the Tribunal that Parliament has adopted.\n[112] I empathise with the Complainants\u2019 frustration on this point and with this result. They want to challenge age cut-offs and eligibility rules they believe are discriminatory and that adversely impact them as well as other Canadians with disabilities. They also want to change what they see as a convoluted and complex application system that they say was not properly promoted or administered. But I cannot circumvent the statutory authority that governs the Tribunal and its mandate, nor can I ignore binding law or choose to set aside legal principles to expedite a process and hear the merits of their complaints.\n[113] The parties are free to ask a court to judicially review my decision, and if the Court finds an error in what I have done, they will tell the Tribunal as much. But I cannot commit what I believe is a clear reviewable error, in the name of expediency. The Tribunal is a creature of statute. I would not be doing my job if I did not work within the confines of the law that governs the work I do as an administrative decision-maker in the system for human rights that Parliament has established.\n[114] The Commission argues that finding that the administration allegations are outside the scope of the present complaints would \u201cprevent self-represented parties form having their experiences of discrimination heard, adjudicated and if substantiated, remedied by this Tribunal\u201d. But as the Commission well knows, the Tribunal is not a forum that complainants can directly access to make clams of discrimination. Under the federal human rights system, the Commission is the body empowered to \u201caccept, manage and process complaints of discriminatory practices\u201d (Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Warman, 2012 FC 1162 at 55). Its investigations must be thorough to fulfill its statutory investigate responsibility (Oleson v. Wagmatcook First Nation, 2019 CHRT 35 at para 30). Other than a general statement recalling that it is not obligated to investigate every detail or aspect of a complaint, the Commission did not respond in any meaningful way to ESDC\u2019s claim that it did not investigate the administration allegations.\n[115] The Tribunal also cannot deal with all allegations of unfairness. The Tribunal can only hear and decide cases that the Commission refers. Just as I cannot circumvent binding case law, authority and jurisprudence, I cannot assume part of the role Parliament intended for the Commission to play. As I do not find that these issues were properly before the Commission, I cannot, of my own initiative or because the parties asked me to do so, ignore the four corners of what the Commission referred to the Tribunal.\n[116] I also cannot cure the fact that the allegations the Commission referred are outside the Tribunal\u2019s scope by now adding allegations that I do not find are sufficiently connected to the complaints the Commission referred.\n[117] ESDC sets out a number of other reasons why I should not allow the administration allegations, including: they are vague and unclear; they impugn the wrong service provider (i.e., Banks) which open RDSPs for individuals and provide them with financial advice; they raise factual allegations that go back more than a decade; they are based on a faulty premise that \u201cignorance of the law\u201d gives rise to a claim of discrimination; and they do not relate to the remedies sought. I need not address all these issues as I have already found that the administration allegations were not sufficiently linked to the complaints the Commission referred. I agree with ESDC, however, that the Commission did not address several of those problems in any substance in response to the ESDC\u2019s motion.\n[118] Finally, while I must dismiss these complaints because I am required to follow the legal principles and statutory framework that guide the Tribunal\u2019s work, I commend the Complainants who have represented themselves through a long and challenging process before the Commission and the Tribunal. They have brought the important issues underlying these complaints and their impact on persons with disabilities to the fore. Through their submissions they have made individual and collective proposals for improving the Canada Disability Savings Program which add an important voice to any policy discussions on supports for Canadians with disabilities and their families. While the Tribunal is not the mechanism to effect the change they seek, I hope that their voices will be heard and considered outside this process.\nVI.

OVERVIEW [1] The complainant, Bernard Schulz, wanted to open a Registered Disability Savings Plan (\u201cRDSP\u201d) but the Income Tax Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.1, s.146.4 (ITA) sets an age limit of 59 to qualify for an RDSP, which is required to be eligible for Canada Disability Savings grants and bonds. Grants and bonds are also subject to age limits set out in the Canada Disability Savings Regulations (the \u201cRegulations\u201d). Mr. Schulz alleges that Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) discriminated against him on the grounds of age and disability because he could not apply for an RDSP and related benefits until his niece helped him, by which time he was more than 59 years old. Mr. Schulz says that the age limits in the ITA and the Regulations disproportionately affect seniors and persons with disabilities because of the challenges they face in applying for benefits and that this is a form of systemic discrimination.\n[2] The respondent, ESDC, is the department of the Government of Canada that develops, manages, and delivers social programs and services. ESDC says that the Tribunal does not have the authority to hear Mr. Schulz\u2019s complaint because it is an impermissible challenge to legislation that must be brought before the courts.\n[3] Mr. Schulz concedes that a challenge to the ITA is outside the Tribunal\u2019s authority to decide. He is also pursuing the challenge before the courts and applied for funding to support his claim that the age limits in the ITA and in the Regulations are contrary to the equality protections set out in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 1982, Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c.11 (the \u201cCharter\u201d). He argues, however, that the Tribunal can still hear his challenge to the Regulations. He may also have a third component to his complaint, namely that ESDC allegedly administered and promoted the RDSP in a discriminatory way (the \u201cresidual allegations\u201d).\n[4] Mr. Schulz wants the Tribunal to put his complaint in abeyance for an additional year while he develops his court challenge and reapplies for funding to litigate his case. I previously granted two abeyance requests in Schulz (on behalf of Bernard Schulz) v. Employment and Social Development Canada, 2022 CHRT 6 [Schulz 1] and Schulz (on behalf of Bernard Schulz) v. Employment and Social Development Canada, 2022 CHRT 33 [Schulz 2] in this matter.\n[5] The Commission takes no position on Mr. Schulz\u2019s request.\n[6] ESDC opposes a further 12-month request. It agrees that a shorter adjournment is warranted but should be tied to the release of the Tribunal\u2019s decision in related complaints. In those cases, ESDC filed a motion to strike the complainants\u2019 allegations challenging the Regulations because it said they are beyond the scope of the Act. It argues that the outcome of that motion may settle the question of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to decide a challenge to the statutory scheme governing RDSPs. It asks that the Tribunal schedule a case management conference call (CMCC) with the parties within 40 days of the release of the decision in the related cases. Depending on the outcome, Mr. Schulz may decide to discontinue his complaint, ESDC may move to strike his complaint, or the parties may be prepared to file their Statements of Particulars (SOPs).\nII. DECISION\n[7] I am dismissing the complainant\u2019s request for a further 12-month abeyance. The Tribunal has issued its ruling in the related complaints and decided that challenges to the Regulations are not a service under the Act and have no reasonable prospect of success. In light of that decision, I will grant a 45-day adjournment to allow the parties to review the ruling and determine their positions. Mr. Schulz must confirm whether he intends to proceed with his Tribunal complaint, and if so, on what basis.\nIII. BACKGROUND [8] Mr. Schulz applied for funding to the Court Challenges Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) to start a court challenge to the ITA and the Regulations under the Charter. I granted his request to defer his Tribunal proceeding for 6 months while he pursued his funding application (Schulz 1). The Program denied his application. He then requested a further abeyance while he sought funding to further develop his court challenge.\n[9] I allowed Mr. Schulz\u2019s second request, extending the abeyance by a further 6 months until April 2023 (Schulz 2). I also set deadlines for the parties to file their SOPs at the end of the abeyance period.\n[10] Mr. Schulz is asking the Tribunal to extend the abeyance until April 5, 2024. He was granted funding to develop his case for a 12-month period but did not receive financial support to start litigating the matter. He wants the Tribunal to hold his complaint for another year while he develops his case and reapplies for funding to start the court challenge. He says the Court Challenges Program Expert panel meets three times a year and that he hopes to have a final decision on his request by April 5, 2024.\n[11] The ruling in the related proceedings (Jamus Dorey, Karolin Alkerton, David Huntley and Roderick McGregor v Employment and Social Development Canada CHRT 2023 CHRT 23) was issued on June 15, 2023 [Dorey].\n[12] In Dorey, the Tribunal allowed ESDC\u2019s motion and dismissed the complaints, finding that they were direct attacks on legislation and the mandatory requirements set out in the Regulations. The Tribunal held that the complaints were outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because the non-discretionary entitlements in the Regulations, like the provisions found in legislation, were not a service held out by ESDC. The Tribunal also found that the allegations about ESDC\u2019s administration and promotion of the Canada Disability Savings Program (the \u201cProgram\u201d) were not within the scope of what the Commission referred and could not proceed.\n[13] When the Commission referred Mr. Schulz\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal, it did so under its simplified process whereby parties can provide submissions directly to a Commission member. The Commission applied subsection 49(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1895, c H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d) and referred the complaint to the Tribunal because it could not resolve the allegations through a Commission assessment. Under subsection 49(1) of the Act, the Commission may refer a complaint to the Tribunal at any stage after the filing of the complaint. The Commission stated in its Record of Decision accompanying the referral letter that \u201cit appears that the issues raised in this Complaint are essentially the same issues as those raised in three other complaints for which investigation reports were completed and disclosed to the Respondent\u201d (Alkerton, Huntley and McGregor). It also wrote in its referral that Mr. Huntley was alleging discrimination based on age with respect to the provision of a service against ESDC.\n[14] The Commission decided that further inquiry by the Tribunal was required to determine if the age limit for participation in the grants and bonds is discriminatory. It listed several reasons for its referral, including the fact that it previously assessed and referred other complaints raising the same allegations as those raised in Mr. Schulz\u2019s complaint.\nIV. REASONS [15] The parties have not yet filed SOPs in this case, so I only have the complaint form and the Commission\u2019s referral letter and accompanying Record of Decision to try to understand what this complaint is about and what the Commission referred to the Tribunal. Mr. Schulz\u2019s complaint challenges the ITA and non-discretionary provisions in the Regulations as did the complainants in Dorey. The Commission\u2019s referral letter and Record of Decision also explain that Mr. Schulz raises essentially the same issues as in the other proceeding. The Tribunal dismissed those allegations as having no reasonable prospect of success in Dorey. Mr. Schulz must therefore confirm what parts of his complaint he intends to pursue before I can consider whether there would be any merit in allowing a further adjournment or extension of the abeyance if he is moving forward with the same allegations that were dismissed in Dorey.\n[16] ESDC also argues that a 12-month abeyance is not consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s previous two rulings in this case. I agree. In Schulz 1, I held that the Tribunal inquiry process is not an insurance policy or fall-back measure. But by asking me to put his complaint in abeyance for another year and to wait and see if he receives funding by April 5, 2024, Mr. Schulz is doing just that. If Mr. Schulz does not receive the funding a year from now, will he continue only with the residual allegations before this Tribunal, and if so, what is he alleging and is that what the Commission referred?\n[17] Mr. Schulz previously told the Tribunal that if he did not receive funding to bring his application before the courts, he would return to the Tribunal and challenge those parts of the complaint he believes are within our jurisdiction to decide. At that time, Mr. Schulz argued that the remaining allegations, which include a challenge to the Regulations as well as the residual allegations, could be brought in either forum (Schulz 2 at para 9).\n[18] Until I know what the complainant intends to pursue before this Tribunal and consider the parties\u2019 respective positions in light of Dorey, I cannot determine how to proceed fairly and efficiently in the proceeding. I will adjourn the proceedings for 45 days and set aside any deadlines previously set for the filing and delivery of SOPs to allow the parties to consider the implications of the Tribunal\u2019s ruling in Dorey and for counsel to seek instruction. The Registry will schedule a CMCC to occur after the expiration of these 45 days.\n[19] The parties will provide their positions and proposed next steps in writing in advance of the CMCC so that we use our time efficiently.\nV. ORDER [20] The complainant\u2019s 12-month abeyance request is denied. The proceedings are adjourned for 45 days. All previous deadlines for the filing and exchange of SOPs are suspended pending the next CMCC in this matter.\n[21] The Registrar will schedule a CMCC to occur no sooner than 45 days from now to address next steps with the parties. Once the CMCC is set, the Tribunal will set deadlines for the parties to provide their position on proposed next steps in advance of the CMCC.\n[22] The Registrar will send a copy of Dorey to the parties together with this ruling.\nSigned by\nJennifer Khurana\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 21, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T2729\/10521\nStyle of Cause: Katheryne Schulz (on behalf of Bernard Schulz) v.

It also concerns the employer\u2019s responsibility.\nMs. Young and Mr. Sawchuk were both employed as locomotive attendants at VIA Rail. Ms. Young complained of Mr. Sawchuk's conduct towards her at their workplace over a two-year period. Several incidents showed this offensive conduct. For example, Mr. Sawchuk observed Ms. Young in a way that was not required for his job. He refused to leave the locomotive cab when she asked him. He swore at her and made rude and unprofessional comments in person and over the radio, including using gendered slurs and sexist language. He belittled her in front of her colleagues because of the tone of her voice as a woman and criticized her clothing. He stood very close to her in circumstances that caused her distress. He demanded that communications be broadcast on the open radio, even when close by. He criticized her publicly for carrying out a manoeuvre he had instructed. He tried to intimidate her in ways that put safety at risk.\nThe Tribunal found that the individual incidents, taken on their own, might appear unimportant. However, their cumulative impact over almost two years showed a pattern, a campaign of harassment and abuse. Taken together, these incidents constituted adverse treatment. Sex was a factor in that adverse treatment. It need not be the primary factor or an intentional cause. For these reasons, Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex in the course of employment.\nThe conduct was unwelcome and persistent, and Ms. Young notified the employer of it. Because of this, the Tribunal found that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was also harassment on the basis of sex. However, it was not sexual in nature and therefore not sexual harassment.\nThe Tribunal found VIA responsible for the actions of its employee, Mr. Sawchuk. VIA did not show that it exercised all due diligence to prevent those actions or to mitigate their effects. VIA did not take Ms. Young\u2019s concerns sufficiently seriously. VIA did not address the situation diligently to prevent the discriminatory conduct. VIA had a workplace harassment policy but chose to apply its code of conduct instead. Its response also came after months of escalating harm. In addition, there were few documents and details about the investigation, and the final decision was not made independently.\nThe Tribunal ordered VIA to pay monetary compensation. It also ordered systemic remedies aimed at making sure VIA has in place adequate human rights and anti-harassment policies and procedures.\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation: 2023 CHRT\n25\nDate:\nJune 27, 2023\nFile No.:\nT2225\/4717\nBetween:\nJennifer Young\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nVIA Rail Canada Inc.\nRespondent\nDecision\nMember:\nKirsten Mercer\nTable of Contents\nI.

Overview & Summary of Decision [1] Ms. Jennifer Young (the \u201cComplainant\u201d or \u201cMs. Young\u201d) alleges that her employer, VIA Rail Canada Inc. (the \u201cRespondent\u201d or \u201cVIA\u201d) is liable for harassment perpetrated against her on the basis of her sex by her fellow employee, Mr. Kevin Sawchuck, who is not a party to these proceedings. Ms. Young relied on the protections afforded by s. 7(b) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c.H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d) (against discrimination in the course of employment) and s. 14 of the Act (against harassment on the basis of sex in matters related to employment).\n[2] There was no dispute before the Tribunal that Mr. Sawchuk had engaged in adverse and unprofessional conduct towards Ms. Young. In fact, VIA found that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s treatment of Ms. Young breached VIA\u2019s Code of Conduct, and he was given significant discipline. VIA disputes, however, that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was discriminatory within the meaning of the Act or included harassment on the basis of sex or sexual harassment. VIA also disputes that it is liable for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) supported Ms. Young\u2019s discrimination complaint and argued that VIA was indeed liable under the Act for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. In particular, the Commission argued that VIA had failed to adequately respond to Ms. Young\u2019s initial complaints about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and that VIA\u2019s internal investigation was inadequate. Thus, the Commission argued that VIA was liable for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct.\n[4] For the reasons below, I have determined that Mr. Sawchuk engaged in discriminatory conduct towards Ms. Young, in breach of the Act. Specifically, I have found that Mr. Sawchuk engaged in conduct that constitutes discrimination in the course of Ms. Young\u2019s employment and harassment on the basis of sex. I have found that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was not of a sexual nature and have therefore not found a breach that engages the protections of s. 14(2) of the Act. I have further determined that VIA is not entitled to avoid statutory liability for the workplace conduct of its employee, Mr. Sawchuk, as it failed to exercise all due diligence to prevent or mitigate the discriminatory conduct.\nII. Issues A. Preliminary Issues 1. Historic and Continuing Gender Diversity at VIA [5] The Tribunal takes judicial notice of the fact that, historically, rail work in Canada (including driving and servicing trains) was a predominantly male occupation.\n[6] The Tribunal averted to this context at the hearing during closing arguments, and VIA elected to make supplementary written submission on this point.\n[7] VIA argued that there was \u201cno evidence\u201d that the Toronto Maintenance Centre (\u201cTMC\u201d) was a male-dominated workplace and argued that \u201cwomen\u2019s presence in and contribution to the workplace at the Toronto maintenance Centre was well established.\u201d VIA conceded that the three managers involved with the facts of this case were all men but asserted that they had all received appropriate training regarding harassment and VIA\u2019s Code of Conduct.\n[8] VIA noted that Ms. Leslie Selesnic played an important role in the workplace investigation conducted in this case and noted the involvement of Ms. Barbara Anne Blair.\n[9] Despite VIA\u2019s arguments, the evidence supports a finding that the TMC, and specifically the night shift of locomotive attendants who are most directly implicated in the events at issue in this Complaint, represent an historically male group of workers. This does not mean that there are no women present, which is obviously not the case. Rather, it means that the Complaint is situated within a workplace context with norms and values that are shaped by the dominant culture of the workforce and the mostly male workforce which has historically held those roles.\n[10] At the relevant time, the controllers were all men. The shift supervisor was a man, and, during his evidence, the senior manager of the TMC, Mr. Zeke Medeiros, identified that the historic and ongoing lack of gender diversity in this workplace was a problem that he was committed to addressing and identified the railway as a \u201cmale dominated industry.\u201d\n[11] VIA\u2019s assertion that there is no evidence upon which the Tribunal could conclude that the TMC or rail work more generally has historically been a male work environment is simply inaccurate. In fact, I greatly appreciate the fact that Mr. Medeiros testified with sincerity about his concerns regarding gender diversity at VIA and the TMC specifically. He noted that, when Mr. Sawchuk started at the TMC in (around) 1985, there was only one woman working \u201cback then\u201d and for about a decade they went without any women in the department until Ms. Julie Trepanier and Ms. Teona Kindt were hired.\n[12] Mr. Medeiros also testified that he was pleased when Ms. Young was hired into the locomotive attendant program, stating that \u201cit was good to see a woman entering the program.\u201d\n[13] When the Tribunal observes that the railways are historically male-dominated, it is because properly understanding the historical and normative context of the complaint can be relevant to understanding and addressing discrimination, if it is found to exist. The history does not excuse discrimination nor does acknowledging that history mean that a workplace is doomed to relive it in perpetuity.\n[14] However, until we are able to name and identify the ways in which historical and ongoing privilege shape a workplace, we are limited in our ability to identify discrimination when it occurs and to respond adequately to address and prevent it.\n[15] The Tribunal applauds the initiatives undertaken by VIA to ensure that its workplace continues to reflect the full gender diversity of the communities it serves, some of which were noted by Mr. Medeiros in his evidence. It is in that spirit of striving for discrimination-free work environments that the Tribunal renders its decision.\n2. The Reasonable Woman vs the Reasonable Person in the Same Circumstances [16] At the end of the hearing, having had the benefit of the parties\u2019 closing arguments, and based upon the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Stadnyk v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission), 2000 CanLII 15796 (FCA) [Stadnyk], I asked the parties whether my analysis of the conduct detailed in the Complaint and whether it would or should have been seen as unwanted should be based on the standard of the reasonable person or the reasonable woman, and if that distinction was important in this case.\n[17] VIA argued that it would be prejudiced by the application of a reasonable woman standard in this case, as it would have lost the opportunity to call two of the other women who worked with Mr. Sawchuk, whose testimony about his conduct might have had some bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n[18] I disagree.\n[19] Whether one applies the reasonable woman standard articulated by the Tribunal and upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in Stadnyk or the standard of the reasonable person in the circumstances articulated by the Tribunal in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), 1999 CanLII 18902 (FC) [Franke], (upon which the Respondent purports to rely), in this case (and indeed in the preponderance of cases of sexual and gender harassment), the reasonable person in the circumstances should in fact be a woman.\n[20] The issue of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s relationships with his female co-workers, and in particular female co-workers who do not share Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s approach to the work of a locomotive attendant, was apparent to all parties to this proceeding from the outset. Numerous references to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s relationship with Ms. Kindt and Ms. Trepanier, and other women with whom Mr. Sawchuk interacted in the workplace, were made throughout the hearing and in the parties\u2019 submissions, including in VIA\u2019s submissions.\n[21] Despite this, VIA elected not to call either Ms. Trepanier or Ms. Kindt as a witness in these proceedings. This decision, made for reasons known only to VIA, meant that the assertions that had been made at the hearing about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s working relationship with women in general, and with each of them, could not be put to these women nor could their answers be tested on cross-examination. Whether or not the parties were surprised by the Tribunal\u2019s questions about the Stadnyk decision, it is not credible to assert that any party lacked notice of the issue of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s relationship with his female co-workers. The fact that VIA chose not to call any of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s female co-workers, whatever its reasons may have been, does not now give rise to a suggestion that it would be prejudiced by the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of what a reasonable woman (or a reasonable person in the circumstances) would perceive to be unwelcome conduct.\n[22] Having said all of that, it is my view that the reasonable person in the circumstances of this Complaint is a reasonable woman. And, in any case, I find that it is open to the Tribunal to rely on the Stadnyk decision, which is binding authority on this Tribunal.\nB. Main Issues\nDoes Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Young constitute a breach of the Act?\nDoes Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct constitute discrimination on the basis of Ms. Young\u2019s identity as a woman, or sex, in the course of her employment in the meaning of s. 7(b) of the Act? Does Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct represent harassment on the basis of Ms. Young\u2019s identity as a woman in the meaning of s. 14(1)(c) of the Act? Does Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct constitute sexual harassment in the meaning of s. 14(2) of the Act?\nIf the answer to any of a, b or c above is yes, is VIA liable for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct, by operation of s. 65 of the Act? If so, what remedy should be ordered against VIA?\nIII. Applicable Law [23] Throughout the course of the hearing into this Complaint, and in their closing submissions, the parties focussed their submissions on Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct as harassment on the basis of sex within the meaning of s. 14 of the CHRA (sometimes conflating the idea of harassment on the basis of sex with sexual harassment). Ms. Young also relied upon s. 7(b) of the CHRA to complain about adverse treatment in the course of her employment related to her identity as a woman.\n[24] Under s. 7(b) of the CHRA, it is a discriminatory practice, in the course of employment, to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Section 14(1)(c) of the CHRA provides that it is a discriminatory practice, in matters related to employment, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[25] The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of a complaint of adverse differential treatment in the course of employment (s. 7(b) of the CHRA) and its analysis of a workplace harassment complaint (s. 14 of the CHRA) are both concerned with identifying workplace conduct that discriminates against a complainant on the basis of a protected characteristic. However, the test employed in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of each of the statutory grounds invoked in this complaint is somewhat different, so my reasons will analyze each of those claims below.\ni. Discrimination in Employment (s. 7(b) of the CHRA)\n[26] In the context of an inquiry into a human rights complaint, the burden of proof at the initial stage rests with the complainant. This analysis is often referred to as establishing a prima facie case of discrimination. The use of this Latin maxim is unnecessary, however, as it makes the law less accessible to Canadians and may even give rise to misunderstandings concerning the applicable law in matters related to discrimination (see similar comments in Duverger v. Aeropro, 2019 CHRT 18 (CanLII), at para 14 [Aeropro], Simon v. Abegweit First Nation, 2018 CHRT 31, at para. 51. See also Emmett v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2018 CHRT 23, at paras. 53 and 54 as well as Vik v. Finamore (No. 2), 2018 BCHRT 9).\n[27] Regardless of what this initial stage of the analysis is called, the applicable analysis remains the same: the complainant\u2019s burden is to make a case \u201c[...] which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536, at para 28).\n[28] The three-step analysis for these claims of discrimination was established by the Supreme Court of Canada in Moore v. British Columbia (Education), [2012] SCR 61 [Moore], at paragraph 33. According to this analysis, the complainant must demonstrate:\n(1) that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA;\n(2) that they experienced an adverse impact; and\n(3) that the prohibited ground of discrimination was a factor in the adverse impact.\n[29] The analysis of a complaint alleging adverse differential treatment in the course of employment within the meaning of s. 7(b) of the CHRA will follow the Moore test (see, e.g., Aeropro).\n[30] The evidence presented to the Tribunal must be analyzed on a balance of probabilities, and it is not necessary to demonstrate that the prohibited ground was the sole factor in the adverse impact experienced by the complainant (Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), [2015] SCR 789 [Bombardier]).\n[31] Direct proof of discrimination is not necessarily required, nor must the complainant demonstrate an intention to discriminate (see Bombardier, at paras 40 and 41). Discrimination is often not open or intentional. That is not the question before the Tribunal. Instead, the Tribunal must determine whether the conduct, regardless of intent, had an adverse differential impact on Ms. Young. In doing so, the Tribunal must consider all of the circumstances that gave rise to the Complaint in order to determine whether a subtle scent of discrimination is present (see Basi v. Canadian National Railway Company, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT) [Basi])\n[32] The Tribunal can draw inferences from circumstantial evidence when the evidence presented in support of allegations make such an inference more probable than other possible inferences or hypotheses (see Basi). That said, the circumstantial evidence must be tangibly related to the impugned conduct (see Bombardier, at para. 88).\nii. Harassment on the Basis of Sex (s. 14(1)(c) of the CHRA) [33] The Tribunal\u2019s analysis of a complaint made pursuant to s. 14 of the Act, although ultimately concerned with identifying discriminatory conduct, takes a somewhat different approach.\n[34] Harassment is not defined in the CHRA. However, the case law of the Tribunal and the reviewing courts have framed the applicable analysis for a harassment complaint made pursuant to s. 14 of the Act.\n[35] In Morin v. Canada (Attorney General) 2005 CHRT 41 [Morin], Member Hadjis wrote the following, in paragraphs 245 and 246:\n[245] It is a discriminatory practice, under s. 14 of the Act, to harass an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination in matters related to employment.\n[246] Harassment, as proscribed under the Act, has been broadly defined as unwelcome conduct related to one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims (Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1284; Rampersadsingh v. Wignall (No. 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237 at para. 40 (C.H.R.T.)). In Canada (HRC) v. Canada (Armed Forces) and Franke, [1999] 3 F.C. 653 at paras. 29-50 (F.C.T.D.) (\u201cFranke\u201d), Madame Justice Tremblay-Lamer articulated the test for harassment under the Act. In order for a complaint to be substantiated, the following must be demonstrated:\ni. The respondent's alleged conduct must be shown to be related to the prohibited ground of discrimination alleged in the complaint (in the present case, the Complainant's colour). This must be determined in accordance with the standard of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the case, keeping in mind the prevailing social norms.\nii. The acts that are the subject of the complaint must be shown to have been unwelcome. This can be determined by assessing the complainant's reaction at the time of the alleged incidents of harassment and ascertaining whether [they] expressly, or by [their] behaviour, demonstrated that the conduct was unwelcome. A verbal \u201cno\u201d is not required in all circumstances - a repetitive failure to respond to a harasser's comments constitutes a signal to [them] that [their] conduct is unwelcome. The appropriate standard against which to assess a complainant's reaction will also be that of a reasonable person in the circumstances.\niii. Ordinarily, harassment requires an element of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident may be severe enough to create a hostile environment. For instance, a single physical assault may be serious enough to constitute harassment, but a solitary crude joke, although in poor taste, will not generally be enough to constitute harassment since it is less likely, on its own, to create a negative work environment. The objective, reasonable person standard is used to assess this factor as well.\niv. Finally, where a complaint is filed against an employer regarding the conduct of one or more of its employees, as in the present case, fairness demands that the victim of the harassment, whenever possible, notify the employer of the alleged offensive conduct. This requirement exists where the employer has a personnel department with a comprehensive and effective harassment policy, including appropriate redress mechanisms, which are already in place.\n[36] In its Morin decision, the Tribunal relied on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 [Janzen] and the Franke decision by the Federal Court, both of which were cited before me in this case.\n[37] The Morin principles have been adopted by our Tribunal in various decisions (see for example, Aeropro, Dawson v. Canada Post, 2008 CHRT 41, Hill v. Air Canada, 2003 CHRT 9, Alizadeh-Ebadi v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2017 CHRT 36, Croteau v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2014 CHRT 16, Day v. Canada Post Corporation, 2007 CHRT 43, Stanger v. Canada Post Corporation, 2017 CHRT 8 [Stanger], Siddoo v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 502 2015 CHRT 21 [Siddoo], affirmed 2017 FC 678).\niii. Sexual Harassment (s. 14(2) of the CHRA) [38] The Act does not include an express definition of sexual harassment. However, the Supreme Court of Canada has defined sexual harassment as \u201cunwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment\u201d (Janzen, at 1284). This understanding of the meaning of sexual harassment has been repeatedly confirmed in the decades since its articulation by the Supreme Court of Canada in courts, tribunals and by arbitrators across Canada, including in decisions of this Tribunal (see most recently, Peters v. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. and Gordon, 2022 CHRT 25 [Peters].)\n[39] In Franke, the Federal Court determined that the legal test in Janzen ought to be applied in decisions made by this Tribunal. The Federal Court rearticulated the elements of the test in Janzen:\n1) unwelcome conduct;\n2) conduct that is sexual in nature; and\n3) either a pattern of persistent conduct or a single serious incident.\nAnd it added a fourth requirement:\n4) that the employee notify the employer of the alleged sexual harassment where the employer has a human resources department and a comprehensive and effective sexual harassment policy, including redress mechanisms in place.\niv. Liability for the Conduct of an Employee (s. 65 of the CHRA)\n[40] If a complainant is able to meet the burden of proof for their case, the respondent may avail itself of a defence provided in the CHRA, when possible, or limit liability, where applicable, under subsection 65(2) of the CHRA. In this case, the Respondent seeks to rely on s. 65 to limit its liability in the event that the Tribunal finds that Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint is substantiated.\n[41] Subsection 65(1) of the CHRA provides that \u201cany act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\u201d According to subsection 65(2), this presumption will not apply \u201cif it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\u201d\n[42] In effect, if the Tribunal finds discriminatory conduct on the part of an employee, an employer can avoid being held liable for that conduct if it can demonstrate that it did not condone or consent to the conduct and that it responded in a reasonably effective manner to address or prevent the conduct.\nIV. Analysis A. Ms. Young Was the Subject of Discriminatory Conduct [43] Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint is, essentially, that Mr. Sawchuk treated her in a way that discriminated against her as a woman. In her Complaint, her Statement of Particulars, throughout the course of the hearing and in her closing argument, Ms. Young described the adverse treatment as harassment, as did the Commission.\n[44] As is detailed above, there are two sections of the Act that address the conduct that forms the basis of Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint: s. 7(b) and s. 14, both of which are identified in the pleadings in this matter. While the impugned conduct is the same in each case, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of each statutory protection is somewhat different. Therefore, I will consider and make findings with respect to the facts alleged by Ms. Young and analyze that conduct first in light of the Tribunal\u2019s test for s. 7(b). I will then consider the same conduct in light of the Tribunal\u2019s test for harassment in relation to sex in matters related to employment (s. 14(1)(c)), and, finally, I will consider the specific test for sexual harassment established through the relevant Tribunal jurisprudence.\n1. Adverse Differential Treatment in the Course of Employment (s. 7(b) of the CHRA) [45] As I have already stated, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of a complaint arising from s. 7 of the Act was set out in Moore. Each of the Moore factors are considered below, but, on the basis of the parties\u2019 submissions, the main questions before the Tribunal are (1) whether the conduct alleged by Ms. Young was established, on a balance of probabilities, and (2) whether it is more likely than not that Ms. Young\u2019s sex was a factor in Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards her.\n[46] Throughout the hearing and in its closing submissions, VIA repeatedly conflated the second and third elements of the Moore analysis (adverse treatment and a connection to a protected characteristic). For example, VIA states:\nThe Respondent submits that although certain incidents described in the allegations could constitute workplace harassment disputes, there is no evidence of any adverse differential treatment or harassment based on sex or gender.\n[47] Conflating these two steps of the analysis obscures the central issue in dispute in this Complaint: whether Ms. Young\u2019s sex was a factor in Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards her.\n[48] To make a proper determination about whether a complaint should be substantiated, each of these steps must be considered in turn.\n[49] First, the Tribunal must consider if the Complainant possesses a characteristic that is protected by the Act. Second, the Tribunal must consider whether the Complainant experienced any adverse treatment, which is clear on the evidence presented in this case and which will be laid out in more detail below. And third, assuming the presence of adverse treatment, the Tribunal must consider whether the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse treatment, recalling that it need not be the sole or even primary cause of the adverse treatment but merely a factor in the adverse treatment.\ni. Protected Characteristic [50] There was no dispute before me over the fact that Ms. Young\u2019s sex is female or that sex is a protected characteristic under the Act.\nii. Adverse Treatment [51] Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint alleges more than twenty incidents that she claims constituted harassment on the basis of her sex. In the course of the hearing, some of the events were discussed in detail, others were only mentioned in passing, and still others were not mentioned at all. For the purpose of this analysis, I haven taken my cue from the parties and will focus my reasons on those events or incidents which were emphasized at the hearing and those elements or aspects of the complaint that were most relevant or useful in making this decision (Turner, 2012 FCA 159 (CanLii) at para 40, Constantinescu v. Correctional Services Canada, 2022 CHRT 13 at para. 33).\n[52] Based on the evidence presented at the hearing, and informed by VIA\u2019s own definition of harassment as \u201cany unwelcome action which humiliates, offends or intimidates\u201d as is laid out in the VIA harassment policy which was made an exhibit in these proceedings, I have considered eleven of the specific incidents alleged by Ms. Young and the Commission to constitute discriminatory conduct as well as the totality of the interactions between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk about which the Tribunal heard evidence.\n[53] There was no serious attempt to suggest that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was not adverse to Ms. Young. In fact, in addition to VIA\u2019s own findings that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct constituted a breach of the Code of Conduct warranting significant discipline, witnesses, including VIA\u2019s own witnesses, called Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct \u201cboorish\u201d, \u201cunprofessional\u201d, \u201cvulgar\u201d and \u201cdifficult.\u201d\n[54] Despite the fact that the adverse nature of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s treatment of Ms. Young was all-but conceded by VIA at the hearing and was substantiated by VIA\u2019s own internal workplace investigation, I will consider and make findings with respect to many of the specific allegations raised in the Complaint, as the details of those incidents are material to the discussion of the final step of the Moore test: the nexus or connection between the conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s sex or identity as a woman, which was contested by VIA.\n(1) Individual Incidents Alleged in the Course of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s Conduct\nSurveillance and Photographing (January 2012)\n[55] Ms. Young testified that the first incident detailed in her Complaint took place in January 2012. Mr. Sawchuk, she said, was watching her from inside his vehicle while Ms. Young and her partner, Mr. Kanelopoulos, worked at the fuel stand. Ms. Young also testified that Mr. Sawchuk was taking photos of her while she worked that his overall conduct was \u201ccreepy\u201d and that it made her uncomfortable.\n[56] Mr. Kanelopoulos also testified before the Tribunal and corroborated Ms. Young\u2019s testimony, though both witnesses conceded that they were quite far from Mr. Sawchuk at the time.\n[57] Mr. Sawchuk testified before the Tribunal and admitted that he was at the location at the time of this alleged incident, but he denied taking any photos of Ms. Young. In response to questions from the Tribunal, Mr. Sawchuk testified that he has no recollection of what he was doing at the time of the incident. Mr. Sawchuk went on to testify that, upon being confronted about taking photos of Ms. Young by the shift supervisor, Mr. Gilbert Hamilton, he offered to allow VIA to review his phone, presumably to check for evidence of the photos. Mr. Hamilton declined to inspect Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s phone or otherwise determine whether any photos had been taken on the night in question.\n[58] The Tribunal heard evidence from multiple witnesses, including Mr. Sawchuk himself, about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s practice of observing the work performed by his colleagues during their shift and letting them or management know when he found their work to be lacking in some way.\n[59] On the basis of the evidence before me, I find that Mr. Sawchuk was present at the fuel stand and was watching Ms. Young while she and Mr. Kanelopoulos performed their duties. I further find that this type of workplace surveillance by a peer or colleague with no supervisory responsibility over Ms. Young was unwelcome conduct that could humiliate, offend or intimidate.\n[60] I am unable to make a finding, based on the evidence before me, that Mr. Sawchuk was taking pictures of Ms. Young, though I believe that Ms. Young believes this to be the case. This is not to say that I have concluded that Mr. Sawchuk did not take the photos. Rather, given how far away Ms. Young and Mr. Kanelopoulos were from Mr. Sawchuk, and in light of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s testimony and Mr. Hamilton\u2019s failure to inspect Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s phone, I find that I am unable to make a factual finding either way about whether Mr. Sawchuk was taking pictures of Ms. Young on the night in question.\n[61] A single incident of watching colleagues while they work, though perhaps unpleasant, unwelcome or (to use Ms. Young\u2019s term) \u201ccreepy\u201d, is unlikely to be sufficient to ground a harassment complaint. However, I find that, taken in conjunction with other adverse or unwanted treatment, this conduct is adverse within the meaning of the Act.\nSwearing (January 2012)\n[62] Ms. Young testified that a week following the incident at the fuel stand, described above, she and Mr. Sawchuk had a disagreement about whether Mr. Sawchuk could ride along in the cab while she conducted a train movement. Mr. Sawchuk was, as was sometimes the practice in the train yard, getting a ride from one part of the yard to another on the vehicle that Ms. Young was assigned to move in the course of her duties.\n[63] There is no dispute that Ms. Young was within her rights under the safety rules to ask Mr. Sawchuk to move out of the cab while she was conducting the train movement\u2014a fact that Mr. Sawchuk would have known based on his detailed knowledge and understanding of the safety rules applicable to the work of a locomotive attendant.\n[64] However, instead of acting in a respectful and collegial manner when asked by Ms. Young to leave the cab, the evidence before me was that Mr. Sawchuk responded with an outburst of frustration including the use of swear words.\n[65] At the hearing before the Tribunal, VIA argued that Mr. Sawchuk was not swearing at Ms. Young but merely in response to Ms. Young\u2019s request that he leave her work environment while she was conducting the train movement. I do not find this distinction to be a meaningful one in the circumstances, and neither did VIA manager, Mr. Hamilton, who reprimanded Mr. Sawchuk for conduct that he found unacceptable.\n[66] Although no witness was able to recall the words that Mr. Sawchuk used, I am satisfied that this incident constitutes intimidating behaviour by Mr. Sawchuk and find that it constitutes adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n[67] Following this incident, Ms. Young first reported Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct to management. Mr. Hamilton asked Ms. Young to put her complaint in writing, which she did on January 2, 2012. Ms. Young alleged that Mr. Sawchuk had watched and photographed her at the fuel stand a week prior and had refused to leave the cab upon her request the day prior while she was conducting a train movement. Ms. Young advised VIA that Mr. Sawchuk raised his voice and swore at her.\n[68] I also note, as I will discuss in more detail in my analysis of VIA\u2019s liability for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s workplace conduct, that this heightened response by Mr. Sawchuk to Ms. Young\u2019s request was brought to the attention of management. This kind of aggressive and unprofessional conduct on the part of an employee who is well aware of the rules and expectations of his job ought to have raised concerns for VIA about an underlying problem that warranted further monitoring, if not further investigation.\n[69] However, when the matter (along with the alleged monitoring and photographing of Ms. Young at the fuel stand) was raised with Mr. Hamilton, he did not conduct a thorough investigation, he did not take any steps to actually determine whether or not photos had indeed been taken of Ms. Young (beyond relying on Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s denial) and it does not appear that VIA took any steps to investigate why Mr. Sawchuk responded in such an aggressive manner to his colleague\u2019s request that he leave the cab while she was conducting the train movement.\n[70] While VIA\u2019s closing submissions state that Mr. Hamilton \u201cinvestigated the matter and brought it to resolution,\u201d the events that followed suggest that the matter was far from adequately resolved.\nDangerous driving\n[71] Ms. Young alleged that, in February 2012, shortly after Mr. Hamilton purported to resolve her initial complaint, Mr. Sawchuk drove a company vehicle in a reckless manner towards her in the train yard and proceeded to interfere with her effort to obtain supplies from the storage shed.\n[72] Ms. Young also complained about a second incident of dangerous driving that she alleged had taken place in September 2013. This second incident was the subject of testimony from several witnesses and was identified by Ms. Young as a significant source of concern for her own safety.\n[73] Ms. Young testified that around September 18, 2013, Mr. Sawchuk drove the company vehicle in a reckless manner at a level crossing where she was conducting a train movement. Ms. Young had a very distinct recollection of the events of that day and testified that her level of concern about safety was particularly heightened because of an incident that had occurred at a level crossing near Ottawa where a train had collided with a public transit vehicle, killing six people. Ms. Young noted that the stress level in the TMC yard that night was high, and she believed that Mr. Sawchuk was attempting to intimidate her while she performed the train movements that she had been assigned.\n[74] Ms. Young\u2019s testimony about the September 2013 incident was corroborated by Mr. Kanelopoulos, who told the Tribunal that Mr. Sawchuk drove the company vehicle recklessly at the crossing, resulting in Mr. Kanelopoulos having to \u201cdump the brakes\u201d or stop suddenly. Mr. Kanelopoulos testified that he reported the incident to Mr. Hamilton.\n[75] Mr. Sawchuk also testified about this event and denied that he drove at the crossing in a manner designed to intimidate Ms. Young. He corroborated the near miss incident but stated that he did not see the train as there were no lights at the back of the train and that he was not intending to intimidate Ms. Young.\n[76] The Tribunal heard from many witnesses during the course of the hearing, and the observation that Mr. Sawchuk was fixated on what he perceived to be safety concerns and the Rules were consistently noted in the evidence. Mr. Sawchuk was repeatedly characterized as a \u201ccontrol freak\u201d who was obsessed with safety and the Rules.\n[77] Based on the totality of the evidence about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s experience on the night shift, his vigilant conduct in the yard and his self-described fixation with safety, coupled with the heightened atmosphere of safety consciousness that night following a multiple-fatality collision between a train and a vehicle earlier that day, I do not find it credible that Mr. Sawchuk was approaching a level crossing in a vehicle and was not aware of the presence of a train.\n[78] The evidence supports a finding that the near miss did occur and, while I do not think Mr. Sawchuk acted in a way that he believed would actually endanger himself or the train, I find that it is more likely that Mr. Sawchuk was conscious of what he was doing. While I conclude that Ms. Young sincerely believed that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was an intentional attempt to intimidate or threaten her, particularly in the heightened emotional context that she described on that shift, I do not have sufficient evidence to find that Mr. Sawchuk perpetrated such a reckless act intentionally to harm Ms. Young.\nStanding behind Ms. Young While She Was bending over\n[79] Ms. Young\u2019s complaint included reference to an incident that she alleged took place in April 2012. Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk, who was driving in the yard in a pick-up truck, pulled up his vehicle directly behind her while she was working as the grounds person during a train movement. Ms. Young was conducting an operation that involved aligning a coupling between two train cars, and Ms. Young explained that, in order for her to visualize this alignment, she had to bend at the waist so that her line of sight corresponded with the coupling joint. Ms. Young testified that she was uncomfortable, as a woman, bending over in this way, with Mr. Sawchuk sitting in a vehicle a few feet behind her. It was clear from Ms. Young\u2019s evidence that she felt exposed and vulnerable bending over in this way, particularly given her already strained relationship with Mr. Sawchuk.\n[80] The fact of this interaction was not in dispute before me at the hearing. No witness contradicted Ms. Young\u2019s testimony that she asked Mr. Sawchuk to move away, but rather than comply with his colleague\u2019s request, Mr. Sawchuk refused to move and asserted that she had enough room to complete the manoeuvre. Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk ignored her request. When she again asked him to move, he refused. This evidence was not contested by any witness.\n[81] Ms. Young testified that she then asked for help from Mr. Dor\u00e9 a manager who was nearby, and he dismissed the request remarking that she had enough space to execute the manoeuvre. Once again, Ms. Young\u2019s evidence was corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses.\n[82] It was only when Ms. Young refused to continue with the train movement that Mr. Sawchuk finally drove away, and Ms. Young was then able to complete the task.\n[83] The evidence that the Tribunal heard about the facts of this incident from numerous witnesses, including Ms. Young, Mr. Sawchuk and Mr. Dor\u00e9, was remarkable in its consistency. However, at the hearing, and in their closing submissions, VIA argued that this interaction was \u201cinexplicable\u201d, while Ms. Young was clear that the conduct was evidence of adverse differential treatment on the basis of her sex.\n[84] Ms. Young testified that she was uncomfortable bending over in front of Mr. Sawchuk, a male colleague who made her feel uncomfortable and afraid and whose conduct she had found \u201ccreepy\u201d. Neither Mr. Dor\u00e9 nor Mr. Sawchuk appears to have understood the reason for or the nature of Ms. Young\u2019s concern and request for help.\n[85] I find that Mr. Sawchuk refused to move when he was asked to do so by Ms. Young and that, when she asked Mr. Dor\u00e9 for assistance, she was refused help. I further find that the reasonable person in the circumstances should have understood that having a male co-worker, with whom you have a strained relationship, sit behind you in a vehicle and watch you while you bend over is conduct that can be considered adverse and unwelcome.\n[86] While this interaction will be revisited in the analysis of the connection between the adverse treatment that Ms. Young experienced and her sex, it is clear that neither at the time of the incident, nor subsequently, did VIA understand what about this incident was distressing to Ms. Young; that is, bending over with her backside exposed to a male colleague with whom she had a strained relationship and about whom she had expressed discomfort.\n[87] What\u2019s more, I find that Mr. Dor\u00e9\u2019s failure to ascertain what was happening in front of him and his refusal of Ms. Young\u2019s request for assistance compounded the impact of the situation, leaving Ms. Young with the sense that her concerns were being dismissed by her employer.\n[88] Ms. Young testified, although only in passing, about another incident where Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s physical proximity to her caused her distress in a similar manner.\n[89] Ms. Young described an incident where she was coming down a ladder to disembark from the train, and Mr. Sawchuk began to climb the same ladder, placing himself immediately below her. It was clear from Ms. Young\u2019s evidence that she felt exposed and vulnerable in this position.\n[90] As the matter was not addressed by any other witness and was only mentioned in passing by Ms. Young, I find that it is more likely than not that this interaction occurred, but I will not place much weight on it in my reasons.\nRude and Demeaning Comments\n[91] Ms. Young testified that she was repeatedly subjected to rude and demeaning comments made by Mr. Sawchuk about her, either in person or over the radio. She specifically testified that, in December 2012, Mr. Sawchuk made comments about her using the washroom and broadcasted these comments over the radio frequency used by all of the locomotive attendants on duty. Ms. Young\u2019s testimony about this incident was corroborated by other witnesses, including Mr. Al Arsenault, and VIA did not dispute or directly challenge this allegation.\n[92] Mr. Arsenault, who was working with Ms. Young at the time, testified that he heard this exchange over the radio. When he picked Ms. Young up from the shop where she had been during the incident, he observed that she had been crying and testified that when he asked Ms. Young about what happened she told him she was embarrassed and uncomfortable.\n[93] Based on the evidence before me, I find that it is more likely than not that this incident occurred as alleged, and I find that it constitutes adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n[94] Ms. Young also alleged that Mr. Sawchuk spoke in a demeaning and unprofessional manner to her about how she should conduct a train manoeuvre. Despite the fact that Mr. Sawchuk was not Ms. Young\u2019s supervisor, Ms. Young alleged that Mr. Sawchuk spoke to her rudely and told her that: \u201cI will give you an instruction.\u201d Ms. Young testified that she understood this to be Mr. Sawchuk trying to assert his superiority and dominance over her, insisting that she conform to his ideas about how train manoeuvres should be conducted, despite the fact that, as the Tribunal heard, there is often more than one correct way to safely perform a task in the yard.\n[95] VIA did not counter the allegation that Mr. Sawchuk behaved rudely towards Ms. Young, either in this specific incident or more generally. In fact, Ms. Young testified that Mr. Dor\u00e9 had agreed with her at the time of that incident that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s tone and communication were inappropriate. Mr. Dor\u00e9 corroborated Ms. Young\u2019s evidence on this point during his testimony. And Mr. Medeiros, during his cross-examination, confirmed that he had told Ms. Young that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour was \u201charassment, absolutely.\u201d Mr. Medeiros testified that by the time he became involved in the situation between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk, he knew that she was anxious being around Mr. Sawchuk and there was no question that she was upset and fearful of him.\n[96] I find that Mr. Sawchuk repeatedly spoke in a rude and unprofessional manner about Ms. Young to her, in her presence and over the radio, and that this course of conduct constitutes adverse treatment under the Act.\nCriticism of Ms. Young\u2019s Radio Voice (October 2012)\n[97] Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk complained about her radio voice not being loud enough for him to hear her while they were working on the same shift but not partnered together. Ms. Young alleged that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s criticism was targeted towards her as a female colleague and that it was intended to demean and belittle her. Ms. Young noted that other colleagues did not have any difficulty hearing and understanding her over the radio and that Mr. Sawchuk was picking on her in a manner that related to a sex characteristic: a female (softer) voice.\n[98] Mr. Sawchuk admitted that he made the complaint about Ms. Young\u2019s radio voice repeatedly to numerous people and asserted that he was raising a valid concern about Ms. Young\u2019s non-compliance with radio protocol. Mr. Sawchuk testified that he has made this complaint about other locomotive attendants as well. This was supported by Mr. Medeiros\u2019 testimony that Mr. Sawchuk was a \u201cstickler\u201d for radio protocol.\n[99] Despite Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s complaints, the Tribunal did not hear any evidence that this was a performance issue for Ms. Young or that her conduct was outside that which is expected of someone in her role. Absent any evidence that Mr. Sawchuk was raising a valid safety or performance issue, I find that his complaint to and about Ms. Young\u2019s voice to be adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n[100] It is worth noting that comments and behaviour that might appear to be neutral to someone who carries dominant culture privilege in a particular context can feel and in fact be excluding, othering and discriminatory to someone who does not hold the same privilege in that context.\n[101] For example, comments about a sex characteristic, such as the tone of a woman\u2019s voice or the appropriateness of her clothing, in an historically male context may create an experience of \u201cotherness\u201d that has the effect of diminishing or demeaning someone on the basis of a protected characteristic. Or comments about a racialized person\u2019s family background, or physical characteristics (such as their hair) in a context where most people do not share those characteristics, can create discriminatory effects. These kinds of comments are increasingly understood as a form of discriminatory conduct called microaggressions.\n[102] Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s complaint had the impact of conveying that the way Ms. Young speaks on the radio is wrong or incorrect (something that has not otherwise been raised as a performance issue by other colleagues or supervisors). And Ms. Young testified that she felt this conduct was targeted towards her and was part of a pattern of behaviour on the part of Mr. Sawchuk intended to assert control and dominance over her in the workplace. What\u2019s more, I find that Mr. Sawchuk made this complaint about Ms. Young to her supervisor and, by his own admission, to other colleagues. While I cannot assess whether it was a valid workplace concern from the perspective of the radio protocols and safety rules, I find that the conduct was at least unprofessional. On balance, in the context of the overall relationship and the course of conduct described in these reasons, I find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s comments and complaints about Ms. Young\u2019s voice over the radio were adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\nIgnoring Communication and Insisting on Radio Communication (December 2012)\n[103] Ms. Young testified that towards the end of 2012, after almost twelve months of what she described as unprofessional and degrading conduct by Mr. Sawchuk with minimal intervention by VIA, the situation between Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young had deteriorated considerably. Ms. Young testified that by this point, when she and Mr. Sawchuk were partnered together on a shift, he insisted on broadcasting all communication between them over the shared radio frequency used by all of their colleagues on the shift, despite the fact that they were often just a few feet apart from each other and were well within speaking range. She testified that he also demanded that she do the same. This allegation was not contradicted by any witness, and I understand that this is not a normal practice among colleagues who are working together.\n[104] The situation came to a head on December 7, 2012, when, according to Ms. Young\u2019s evidence, Mr. Sawchuk refused to acknowledge her when she was speaking with him in the cab of the train. Ms. Young responded by putting the train into an emergency stop, which I understand from the various witnesses who testified about this incident at the hearing to be a serious response to a perceived threat to safety in the train yard.\n[105] Mr. Sawchuk responded to Ms. Young\u2019s actions by exiting the cab and slamming the door behind him.\n[106] I find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s insistence that his colleague communicate with him only over the radio to be demeaning and controlling. While I heard testimony that this would have been within the parameters of the safety Rules and radio protocols, I am not convinced that there was a valid safety reason for Mr. Sawchuk to require Ms. Young to communicate with him only by radio. I find that Mr. Sawchuk was intending to control and embarrass Ms. Young and assert his dominance and perceived superiority over her by using conduct that was permitted by the rules to make her feel inadequate to his requirements, and that this conduct constitutes adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n[107] Ms. Young reported this incident to her supervisor, Mr. Dor\u00e9, who testified that he was also concerned about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. Mr. Dor\u00e9 characterized the deteriorating workplace dynamic as a safety hazard and, at this time, escalated his concerns about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour (both with regard to this incident and more generally) to senior management, including Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton in an email dated December 8, 2012.\n[108] Mr. Dor\u00e9\u2019s email expressed a high level of concern about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct in light of the events described by Ms. Young. Mr. Dor\u00e9\u2019s email conveyed alarm about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s interactions with a number of employees and stated, \u201cHow many more were there, and how many more are we going to tolerate?\u201d.\n[109] Mr. Medeiros, who received the memo from Mr. Dor\u00e9, testified that \u201cit was all hearsay\u201d and (despite admitting that he had received the email from on of his managers expressing alarm about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and characterizing the situation as dangerous) testified that he concluded there had been no formal written complaint about Mr. Sawchuk. Both at the time and at the hearing, VIA downplayed the seriousness of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s concerns, taking the position that Ms. Young was overreacting to the harm that she was experiencing. VIA management was also focussed on the existence of formal written complaints and insufficiently concerned about the rapidly deteriorating and potentially dangerous situation unfolding in plain view between Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young.\n[110] I find that, by December 2012, there was ample evidence confronting VIA management that the situation between Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young was dysfunctional and dangerous (particularly in light of it being a safety-sensitive workplace).\n[111] Virtually every witness who testified before the Tribunal about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour described him in unflattering terms. And VIA made no effort to counter Ms. Young\u2019s argument that Mr. Sawchuk was rude, controlling and unprofessional.\n[112] The impact of VIA diminishing and downplaying the deteriorating situation, including the concerns raised in Mr. Dor\u00e9\u2019s December 2012 email, was that the situation was getting increasingly out of hand. Certainly by this point, it ought to have been clear to VIA that Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young could not safely work together, particularly given the nature of their roles.\nMr. Sawchuk Observing the Women\u2019s Locker Room\n[113] Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk was frequently present in the seating area outside of the women\u2019s locker room when she arrived at work for the start of her shift. Her evidence on this point was corroborated by Mr. Kalelopoulos and was admitted by Mr. Sawchuk.\n[114] Ms. Young testified that she was concerned that Mr. Sawchuk was watching her arrival at work and taking photographs of her in the locker room. I believe that this was a real concern for Ms. Young and that she sincerely felt that Mr. Sawchuk was observing her while she was arriving and getting ready to work. In the context of the increasingly fraught and deteriorating relationship between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk, I understand why Ms. Young found this to be adverse treatment.\n[115] Mr. Sawchuk testified that he regularly sits in the seating area known as \u201cthe leathers\u201d with colleagues when they are on a break from their duties in the yard and sometimes on his own. He also testified that he was not watching Ms. Young in the locker room or photographing her while she was getting ready for her shift.\n[116] Based on images of the locker room that were entered into evidence at the hearing, I find that the locker room entrance is visible from the seating area, but I did not find sufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the interior of the locker room can be seen from the lounge chairs. The evidence presented at the hearing does not support a finding that Mr. Sawchuk was photographing Ms. Young in the locker room, despite her sincere fear that this was occurring.\n[117] I find, based on the totality of the evidence, including Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s own testimony and Mr. Medeiros\u2019 characterization of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct as someone who routinely observed and commented on the workplace conduct of his colleagues, that it is more likely than not that Mr. Sawchuk was observing Ms. Young\u2019s comings and goings at work in a manner that was not required for his job.\n[118] While this conduct, on its own, is not significant, it forms part of a course of conduct and contributed to an atmosphere in which Ms. Young felt watched and surveilled by Mr. Sawchuk. I find that Mr. Sawchuk was, in fact, watching and surveilling Ms. Young and that this conduct was adverse conduct directed towards Ms. Young.\nDispute Over Working With the Cab Door Open and Comments on Ms. Young\u2019s Attire (February 2013)\n[119] Ms. Young testified that she and Mr. Sawchuk were working together in the cab of an engine in February 2013. Mr. Sawchuk was located near the door of the cab and insisted on keeping the door of the cab open for a number of hours during their shift on a cold, winter day. Ms. Young testified that she was very uncomfortable with this situation and that Mr. Sawchuk was unwilling to accommodate her request that the door of the cab be closed.\n[120] When Ms. Young asked her supervisor, Mr. Hamilton, for assistance in managing the situation with Mr. Sawchuk, he spoke with Mr. Sawchuk. The evidence before the Tribunal is that Mr. Sawchuk responded to Ms. Young\u2019s complaint by telling Mr. Hamilton that Ms. Young should \u201cconsider dressing more appropriately for the weather\u201d, implying that Ms. Young\u2019s request for the door to be closed during the winter was unreasonable or that she didn\u2019t understand how to dress herself for her job.\n[121] Mr. Hamilton determined that it was up to the employee assigned as the driver on any given shift or manoeuvre to decide whether the door of the cab would be open or closed. The crewmember should follow the instructions of the driver.\n[122] A further dispute occurred in March 2013. Ms. Young was assigned as driver on that shift, and Mr. Sawchuk was riding in the cab. Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk refused to close the door to the cab, despite being requested to do so by Ms. Young, and despite Mr. Hamilton\u2019s prior direction that the driver was authorized to decide whether the door would be open or closed.\n[123] The facts surrounding these incidents were not in dispute before me. However, the characterization of the incident differed considerably.\n[124] Ms. Young complained that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was dismissive and his comments about her attire at work were demeaning and sexist.\n[125] VIA argued that the dispute between the two co-workers was a simple dispute about comfort in the workplace and a difference of what the temperature should be in their work environment.\n[126] Even if VIA\u2019s characterization of the first incident is plausible though unlikely in the overall context of the relationship between Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young, the reoccurrence of the dispute a few weeks later, despite the direction of their manager, is telling of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s true intent. Insisting, over a colleague\u2019s objections, on keeping the door open on a cold winter night is not a reasonable disagreement between co-workers about workplace temperature, particularly when it happens repeatedly despite clear direction from a supervisor. I find on a balance of probabilities that this conduct was an attempt by Mr. Sawchuk to assert control and dominance over Ms. Young and to take an opportunity to needle her and make her uncomfortable, which constitutes as adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n[127] I also find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s comment to their supervisor that Ms. Young should dress appropriately for the weather to be demeaning and patronizing.\n[128] I do not agree that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s comments about Ms. Young\u2019s clothing were sexualized or sexual harassment. However, as is discussed elsewhere in these reasons, comments designed to diminish or dismiss can nonetheless be discriminatory on the basis of sex\u2014particularly where those comments are part of a pattern of behaviour aimed at establishing dominance and control and are related to a protected characteristic.\nUndermining Ms. Young in Respect of a Train Movement\n[129] The same night that the second incident with the cab door occurred in early March 2013, Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk (who was working on the ground) instructed her (as the driver) to complete a train movement, stating: \u201c203, go ahead.\u201d This meant that Train 203 should proceed forward. Ms. Young testified that she then proceeded with the movement, as directed. Mr. Sawchuk then admonished her over the radio repeatedly for conducting the manoeuvre, denying that he had instructed her to do so.\n[130] Ms. Young\u2019s evidence on this point was clear and specific. She testified that this event was tremendously concerning to her, as it could have given rise to serious consequences for her if anything had happened to the train or any other vehicle or person in the yard. Ms. Young\u2019s evidence on this point was not contradicted by any other witness. When asked about the incident, Mr. Sawchuk testified that he did not have a specific recollection of the events in question.\n[131] On balance, I find that Ms. Young\u2019s evidence on this point is reliable. She testified about her clear recollection of the event, and her actions that immediately followed this incident corroborate her testimony that she was afraid of the safety and professional consequences that might arise from an event like this, should it ever occur again. Furthermore, this testimony was consistent with the events as documented in her workplace complaint, her interview with Ms. Selesnic and her Complaint. Therefore, I find that Mr. Sawchuk did give Ms. Young a direction to move the engine and then admonished her over the radio for doing so, which constitutes adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n[132] When Ms. Young went to Mr. Hamilton stating that she was no longer willing to work with Mr. Sawchuk, he asked her to put her work refusal in writing. At this point, Ms. Young submitted nine letters of complaint to VIA detailing the events that had occurred from April 2012 to March 2013. These letters make it clear that the situation between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk had reached the point where Ms. Young was afraid of the safety implications of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and the resulting dysfunction in the workplace.\n[133] At this stage, Mr. Medeiros became more directly involved with the situation and both Ms. Young and Mr. Medeiros testified that they viewed the situation as being one which engaged the VIA workplace harassment policy. A series of steps were put in place in March and April of 2013, including a formal workplace harassment investigation, conducted by Ms. Selesnic, another manager at VIA.\n[134] The investigation conducted by Ms. Selesnic will be considered in more detail below. However, it is important to note at this point in my reasons that, following an internal workplace investigation (which was, in fact, a series of detailed interviews), Ms. Selesnic provided some form of a verbal report of her findings to Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton. It does not appear that a written report was prepared, and, in any case, none was presented in evidence before the Tribunal. Despite having initially been framed as a harassment complaint, at some point during the process, VIA recharacterized the process as being an investigation into \u201cconduct unbecoming.\u201d\n[135] Ultimately, following the investigation, VIA management decided that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Young breached the Code of Conduct and required a serious disciplinary response.\n[136] VIA\u2019s evidence was that the disciplinary steps taken in response to the investigation were:\n(a) 25 demerit points were awarded against Mr. Sawchuk; and\n(b) Mr. Sawchuk was directed to avoid contact with Ms. Young.\n[137] While the Tribunal is not bound by the findings of an internal workplace investigation, the fact that VIA itself determined that Mr. Sawchuk had engaged in serious conduct in breach of the Code of Conduct is further evidence in support of the Tribunal\u2019s determination that Mr. Sawchuk was engaged in a course of conduct towards Ms. Young that was adverse in nature, both in terms of VIA\u2019s workplace policies and (as is detailed in these reasons) the Act.\nPhysical Contact at the Fuel Stand (September 2013)\n[138] In her Complaint and at the hearing, Ms. Young dedicated considerable time to the question of whether Mr. Sawchuk made physical contact with her at the fuel stand during a shift when they were both working in September 2013.\n[139] Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk entered the fuel stand while she and her partner were already there and proceeded to cross in front of her while she was servicing her engine. Ms. Young testified that, when she was working at the front of the train, Mr. Sawchuk made physical contact with her as he moved past her.\n[140] Mr. Sawchuk denied that he made contact with Ms. Young.\n[141] In considering the evidence on this point, I had the benefit of reviewing video footage as well as a number of photos. Following that review, and in consideration of the testimony of Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk, I conclude that Mr. Sawchuk goes out of his way to cross the tracks near Ms. Young, but there is no evidence upon which I can conclude that he made physical contact with her.\n[142] In making this finding, I have not concluded that Ms. Young was dishonest in her testimony about this event. Based on the totality of the evidence and Ms. Young\u2019s testimony in particular, I am convinced that Ms. Young sincerely believes her evidence to be truthful despite the fact that I cannot make this finding based on my review of the evidence.\n[143] By September 2013, Ms. Young\u2019s perception of events and Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct may have been impacted by the genuine fear and trauma of her sustained experience of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s abusive conduct. While this possibility is relevant to the weight I can place on Ms. Young\u2019s evidence, it does not fundamentally undermine her testimony, particularly as her evidence was, in many instances, corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses.\n[144] While I am not prepared to prefer Ms. Young\u2019s perception of the event in question over my own review of photographic evidence or video footage, I do find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct in the fuel stand that night was not consistent with the admonishment that he had received following the workplace investigation that he avoid Ms. Young. I find that Mr. Sawchuk clearly directed his path in such a way that he would pass extremely closely to Ms. Young, despite the fact that he could easily have chosen to afford Ms. Young more space by redirecting his path.\n[145] Even without making contact with Ms. Young, I find that Mr. Sawchuk flouted the instructions he was given to avoid Ms. Young when he knew or ought to have known that doing so would make her uncomfortable. I find that this behaviour is consistent with the pattern of conduct evident in these reasons whereby Mr. Sawchuk attempted to assert control or dominance over Ms. Young, often with relative impunity, and that this constitutes adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act.\n(1)The Overall Course of Conduct of Mr. Sawchuk\n[146] In addition to analyzing individual incidents to determine the impact of an individual\u2019s conduct on the complainant, it is often important to take a step back and consider the overall course of conduct in its entirety. In many cases, including this one, the whole is indeed much greater than the sum of its parts.\n[147] While many of the individual incidents alleged in Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint, taken on their own, might appear insignificant, the cumulative impact of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct over the course of almost two years, demonstrates a pattern of demeaning behaviour likely designed to assert control and which certainly had an adverse impact on Ms. Young.\n[148] The Tribunal heard weeks of testimony from sixteen witnesses, virtually all of whom testified that it was challenging to work with Mr. Sawchuk, including Mr. Sawchuk himself. The evidence painted a very clear and largely consistent picture of Mr. Sawchuk as a very capable locomotive attendant with a great deal of experience and knowledge about working with trains, who was difficult to work with on a day-to-day basis for many colleagues and supervisors.\n[149] Witnesses used words like \u201cbully,\u201d \u201ccontrolling,\u201d \u201cbig trouble\u201d in respect of Mr. Sawchuk to describe behaviour that the Tribunal would characterize as abusive and toxic, including hearing him shouting at employees and using vulgar language or swearing. Witnesses also described Mr. Sawchuk as someone who would watch his peers in the workplace and purport to correct their performance or to report performance that he deemed improper to the shift supervisors. Mr. Medeiros described Mr. Sawchuk as someone who likes to be right all the time and believes that he is the best at the job\u2014 that he believes that his way of doing things is always the best way.\n[150] I heard evidence from numerous witnesses that Ms. Young did not defer to Mr. Sawchuk about how to perform her duties as a locomotive attendant. Several witnesses confirmed that there are numerous tasks where there is more than one right way to do the job, and locomotive attendants could successfully perform the duties of their job without necessarily following the approach espoused by Mr. Sawchuk. However, failing to defer to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s preferred approach meant that some employees, particularly those he viewed as inferior in skill and experience to himself, were targeted as the subject of his criticism, intimidation and control.\n[151] Mr. Medeiros testified that Mr. Sawchuk took this approach with newer employees, a number of whom were women, and did not try to control the workplace conduct of the more seasoned locomotive attendants that he had worked with for a long time, all of whom were men.\n[152] I find that, in this case, Mr. Sawchuk had disdain for the way in which Ms. Young approached her work as a locomotive attendant and did not respect her as a workplace peer. Ms. Young did not defer to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s attempts to train her in his approach to the job and thus attracted his ire. As a result, Ms. Young was subjected to a campaign of harassment and abuse that, taken together, constitutes serious adverse treatment that ought to have been recognized and addressed by VIA.\nSummary of Adverse Treatment\n[153] It is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to comment on conduct that extends beyond the scope of the Complaint. Furthermore, the Tribunal does not purport to hold any particular expertise in the areas beyond the scope of the Act. However, given the evidence that was presented to the Tribunal, and the safety sensitive nature of the work being performed by locomotive attendants at the TMC, Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint illustrates the peril that can befall a workplace that fails to identify and eliminate toxic and abusive workplace behaviour.\n[154] Having regard to the totality of the evidence, including the findings of VIA\u2019s own workplace investigation, the evidence of many witnesses including VIA\u2019s own witness, Mr. Medeiros, and the documents entered into evidence, I find that Mr. Sawchuk engaged in a pattern of belittling and demeaning behaviour towards Ms. Young from January 2012 until the end of 2013 when Mr. Sawchuk was removed from the night shift and they stopped working together.\n[155] I find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Young, taken as a whole, constitutes adverse treatment in the meaning of the Act. On balance, this conduct meets the threshold necessary to satisfy the second step of the Moore analysis.\niii. The Protected Characteristic Was a Factor in the Adverse Treatment [156] Having determined that Mr. Sawchuk engaged in a course of conduct that was adverse to Ms. Young, the Tribunal will now turn to an analysis of whether Ms. Young\u2019s sex was a factor in the adverse treatment that she experienced. It is fair to say that this is not a case where the discriminatory nature of the conduct is glaringly obvious. Indeed, in the language of this Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence, it is a case where detecting the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d requires a careful examination of the events in their full context (Basi).\n[157] Perhaps then, it ought not come as a surprise that this is the aspect of the Complaint that was the most contested between the parties. The Tribunal will summarize the position of the parties with respect to the connection between the adverse treatment described above and Ms. Young\u2019s sex before outlining my reasons for finding that Ms. Young\u2019s sex was a factor in the adverse treatment that she experienced.\nPosition of the Complainant\n[158] As has been detailed above, the Tribunal has concluded that Mr. Sawchuk attempted to assert dominance and impose a particular approach to the work of locomotive attendants that was consistent with his preferred approach. This conduct was primarily directed at \u201cless seasoned\u201d employees who did not defer to his views about how the work was to be performed. Ms. Young was one of these employees.\n[159] Ms. Young repeatedly identified her gender or sex as a factor in her experience of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour. Throughout the course of the hearing and in her submissions, Ms. Young identified four ways in which her identity as a woman was a factor in the adverse treatment she experienced:\n1) Mr. Sawchuk responded more aggressively to women who resisted his attempts to control them than he did to men, who he would not dare to challenge;\n2) Mr. Sawchuk engaged in several specific incidents where sex was a direct factor in the adverse treatment itself, including refusing to move from behind Ms. Young when she had to bend over, climbing the ladder behind her so that he was immediately behind her backside, complaining to management about her voice over the radio, and commenting in a patronizing way about Ms. Young not being dressed appropriately to do her job;\n3) As a woman working at night in a large and often poorly lit train yard, Ms. Young\u2019s experience of fear and intimidation as a result of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct is connected to her identity as a woman; and\n4) VIA\u2019s failure to identify and respond to the discriminatory nature of the situation between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk led to her being dismissed and diminished by VIA\u2019s predominantly male management for too long.\nPosition of the Respondent\n[160] VIA\u2019s position was that Mr. Sawchuk was a difficult colleague who engaged in unprofessional conduct but that his conduct towards Ms. Young was unrelated to her identity as a woman. While Mr. Sawchuk may have been impolite, uncivil or engaged in \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d, as the workplace investigation concluded, Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour was the product of a dispute between two groups of employees, and VIA argued in their closing submissions that \u201ca reasonable person would not construe the conduct as adverse differential treatment or harassment based on sex or gender.\u201d\n[161] VIA submitted that Ms. Young\u2019s enmity towards Mr. Sawchuk distorted her perception of his positive relationships with other women in the workplace.\n[162] VIA also argued that Ms. Young presented vague and unsubstantiated allegations about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s prior working relationships with female colleagues and that the Tribunal should prefer Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s evidence about his attitudes and behaviour towards women over the evidence presented by Ms. Young and their colleagues who testified at the hearing.\n[163] In its closing submissions, VIA also highlighted portions of the evidence presented by several other witnesses (including Kirk Porter, Michelle Pitt and Mr. Arsenault) to support their position that Mr. Sawchuk had a good working relationship with some women.\n[164] Finally, VIA called upon the Tribunal to reject the evidence of Mr. Arsenault, Mr. Micallef, Mr. Anroop and Mr. Cormier, who all testified that Mr. Sawchuk had difficulties with women\u2014particularly women who did not submit to his approach about how to perform the duties of a locomotive attendant. Each of these witnesses specifically testified that they believed Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s treatment of Ms. Young was, in part, due to the fact that she is a woman.\niii. Position of the Commission\n[165] The Commission argued that the primary issue for the Tribunal to determine with respect to this Complaint is whether Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour towards Ms. Young constitutes harassment based on the prohibited ground of sex under the CHRA. In its closing submissions, the Commission stated: \u201cThe question is whether his behaviour, in this circumstance had anything to do with Ms. Young\u2019s gender.\u201d\n[166] The Commission\u2019s submissions identified that the evidence on this point is, at least in part, contradictory and that the Tribunal\u2019s answer to this question turns on an assessment of the credibility of the witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal.\n[167] The Commission noted, on the one hand, that Ms. Selesnic and Mr. Medeiros both testified that they did not believe that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was related to Ms. Young\u2019s sex, and Ms. Selesnic testified that, at the outset of the workplace investigation, Ms. Young had been focussed on workplace safety and not sex-based harassment.\n[168] On the other hand, the Commission noted that Ms. Young testified that Mr. Sawchuk treated women differently than men and that, when she challenged him about how he felt she should be performing her work as a locomotive attendant, he responded to her in a manner that was different than how he responded to her male colleagues when they resisted his approach to the job.\n[169] The Commission observed that Mr. Arsenault corroborated Ms. Young\u2019s evidence on this point and testified that Mr. Sawchuk treats women differently. Mr. Arsenault testified that Mr. Sawchuk likes to control how people work and that he will confront his female colleagues until they submit to working in his preferred way of doing things. The Commission also noted Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s generally controlling behaviour, noting that a number of witnesses referred to him as a control freak.\nAnalysis of the Connection Between Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s Conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s Sex\n[170] The Tribunal recalls that discrimination is often not overt and, in many cases, may not be intentional. However, to give meaning to the protections of the Act, the Tribunal is mandated to identify even a subtle scent of discrimination to determine whether a protected characteristic is a factor in the impugned conduct.\n[171] Where evidence of discrimination is circumstantial, an inference of discrimination may be drawn where the Tribunal concludes that the evidence offered in support of such a finding renders the inference that such a conduct was more likely discriminatory than not, on a balance of probabilities.\n[172] In addition to the submissions of the parties, the Tribunal has reviewed the transcripts of the hearing and the documents entered into evidence pertaining to the question of the connection between Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s sex. On the basis of that review and having regard to both the specific incidents and the overall course of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct, I have concluded that there is sufficient evidence to find that there is a connection between Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s sex.\n[173] There are two main points upon which I have based this finding:\n(a) On balance, the evidence at the hearing favoured a finding that Mr. Sawchuk treated women who did not agree with his way of working, including Ms. Young, differently than he treated the men with whom he had similar disagreements; and\n(b) Ms. Young\u2019s sex was a factor in some of the specific incidents that the Tribunal has found to constitute adverse treatment.\n[174] I will explain each of these points in more detail below.\n(a)Mr. Sawchuk Treated Women Who Disagreed With Him Differently Than Men\n[175] Several witnesses testified that Mr. Sawchuk behaved more aggressively towards women who disagree with him than he did men and was more likely to try to force his approach to the locomotive attendant job upon the female employees. This evidence was countered by witnesses from VIA who testified that they had not observed Mr. Sawchuk treating women differently than men.\n[176] Several of the witnesses that Ms. Young called to testify painted a picture of Mr. Sawchuk as someone who had a problem with women. The evidence of these witnesses was consistent and corroborated Ms. Young\u2019s own testimony.\n[177] The witnesses called by VIA, including Mr. Sawchuk, who testified about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s interactions with women, either denied that he treated women and men differently or testified that they had not observed that behaviour in Mr. Sawchuk and did not recall specific incidents that were put to them on cross-examination.\n[178] At least in part, the evidence from these two sets of witnesses cannot be reconciled. Therefore, I consider which evidence to prefer in reaching my decision. As both VIA and the Commission pointed out in their closing submission, this critical question comes down to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the credibility of two incompatible sets of witness accounts.\n[179] Ms. Young testified that she has observed Mr. Sawchuk treating her male colleagues differently than he treated her, even when they disagree with him, and that he treated women differently in general. Both Mr. Arsenault and Mr. Micallef also testified that Mr. Sawchuk treats women differently. Mr. Micallef testified that, when it comes to female employees, he will confront them until they acquiesce to doing their work in his preferred way.\n[180] In response to a question from the Tribunal, Mr. Micallef stated:\nYeah, well, when he has a problem with a male employee, he wouldn't come to us. He would go to the manager and have management come to us. Whether it (sic) substantiated or not, he just goes there and he complains about us. But with the women, they'll just -- he's just on them, badgering them. \"You got to do it this way. You got to do it this way.\" But with us, he won't tell us that, especially (sic) we know our job.\n[181] This account from Mr. Micallef is corroborated by the evidence from other witnesses, including VIA managers, who testified that Mr. Sawchuk frequently comes to them to complain about other employees. Even if part of the reason for his unwillingness to challenge his male colleagues directly is because he was mistreated by them in the past, which was alleged during Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s evidence, the resulting differential treatment towards Ms. Young, or other women who do not readily conform to his desired approach, is nonetheless discriminatory.\n[182] Mr. Anroop testified about a gendered slur that Mr. Sawchuk used when speaking about Ms. Young and another female co-worker. Mr. Anroop testified that he heard Mr. Sawchuk refer to someone on board a train as a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d, only to later see Ms. Young disembark from the train. Mr. Anroop testified that he understood that Mr. Sawchuk was talking about Ms. Young when he used the gendered slur. Mr. Anroop also described an incident where Mr. Sawchuk called another female co-worker \u201ca fucking bitch.\u201d In response to a series of questions from the Tribunal, Mr. Anroop testified that Mr. Sawchuk disrespects women and puts women down.\n[183] Mr. Sawchuk testified before the Tribunal and denied that he treated women colleagues differently, pointing to his relationship with two other female colleagues as evidence to support his testimony and stating that he has successfully worked with other women in the past. The Tribunal notes that, other than Ms. Young, none of the women who work directly with Mr. Sawchuk were called to testify at the hearing.\n[184] Mr. Medeiros testified that he did not observe Mr. Sawchuk treating women differently, as did Ms. Selesnic, although both witnesses also testified that they did not work directly with Mr. Sawchuk very frequently or at all.\n[185] Mr. Hamilton, who was the direct supervisor of the night shift, testified that he observed Mr. Sawchuk treating all people the same and resisted the proposition that Mr. Sawchuk treated women differently. However, despite being the manager, he did not appear to be aware of a number of incidents pertaining to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct about which other witnesses had testified. And on cross-examination he testified that he did not recall that a complaint had been made about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour by another woman on the shift.\n[186] VIA argued that the Tribunal should discount the evidence of Ms. Young, Mr. Anroop, Mr. Arsenault and Mr. Micallef because:\nMs. Young\u2019s perception of the fact was distorted by her disdain for Mr. Sawchuk; and\nThe witnesses called by Ms. Young to testify about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s behaviour towards women\u2014and particularly women who disagree with him\u2014are unreliable because of their animus towards him.\n[187] VIA further argued that I should prefer Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s evidence to that of Ms. Young on this question.\n[188] The Commission took no position on the credibility issues before the Tribunal.\n[189] As a general matter, while the Tribunal has found that Ms. Young\u2019s evidence may not be reliable in certain instances or her response to a specific incident exaggerated, I found her evidence overall to be sincere and truthful and most of her testimony on this issue was corroborated by other witness accounts and documents or was uncontested by VIA.\n[190] Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s evidence was also mixed. There are aspects of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s evidence that I found to be sincere and truthful, for example, when he described his own experience of workplace harassment and mistreatment by some of his colleagues, and his frustration with management\u2019s inaction. However, his evidence was also inconsistent on a number of points. For example, in response to a question where VIA\u2019s counsel described washing train windows as \u201chalf-assed,\u201d Mr. Sawchuk testified that he would not use colourful language when speaking to his partners. But the Tribunal has found that Mr. Sawchuk did, in fact, swear at his colleagues and use profane language on several occasions. Mr. Sawchuk also testified that he did not understand the basis of the workplace investigation or for the disciplinary award that was made against him, despite having participated in the investigation and insisted that the union grieve the outcome of the investigation process all the way to arbitration\u2014the third step of the grievance process.\n[191] Even if the Tribunal were to set aside the evidence of Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young, each as potentially self-serving, the Tribunal is left, on the one hand, with the testimony of shift colleagues who worked with Mr. Sawchuk for many years who support Ms. Young\u2019s position and who testified about differential treatment and, in the case of Mr. Anroop, the use of a gendered slur to refer to both Ms. Young and another female colleague. On the other hand, the Tribunal has the testimony of two VIA managers, neither of whom worked directly with Mr. Sawchuk at the time in question. VIA elected not to call either Ms. Kindt or Ms. Trepanier (the other two women who worked on the night shift with Mr. Sawchuk at the relevant time) to testify at the hearing about their experiences working with Mr. Sawchuk, although it was clearly open to them to do so.\n[192] The question before the Tribunal is not whether Mr. Sawchuk has disdain for all women, or whether he is unable to work with women at all. In fact, for discrimination to be established, Ms. Young\u2019s sex need not have even been the primary factor or an intentional cause of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s actions\u2014it need only be a factor.\n[193] My observation of Mr. Sawchuk during the course of his evidence was that he may sincerely be unaware of the ways in which his actions are discriminatory on the basis of sex or the gendered nature of his actions in the workplace. For example, he described one female partner in positive terms saying that she \u201ctook direction well\u201d, which stood out as a strange kind of compliment coming from someone who was not that person\u2019s manager or supervisor. I was also disturbed by the evidence about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s repeated use of a gendered slur in anger directed at his colleagues.\n[194] With respect to the specific allegations made against Mr. Sawchuk regarding his attitudes towards women, I am not prepared to disregard the sworn evidence of multiple witnesses who testified about their experience and direct observations about Mr. Sawchuk disrespecting women and treating them in a more aggressive manner than he does his male colleagues. The Tribunal is particularly persuaded by the testimony of Mr. Anroop, who provided specific evidence of his own observation of Mr. Sawchuk using sexist language. Mr. Anroop\u2019s credibility was also supported by VIA\u2019s own witness, Mr. Hamilton, who testified that he does not believe Mr. Anroop to be dishonest or to make up stories.\n[195] In making this finding, I want to be clear that I am not questioning the credibility of either Mr. Medeiros\u2019 or Ms. Selesnic\u2019s evidence. Rather, their testimony about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s working relationship with his female colleagues is merely less reliable as a result of the fact that they had not had many occasions to observe Mr. Sawchuk at work. Nor is Mr. Hamilton\u2019s credibility in question. Rather, these witnesses either had fewer occasions to observe Mr. Sawchuk or did not have a recollection of the specific events that they were asked about. As a result, I am unable to place as much weight on their evidence about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s relationships with his female co-workers.\n[196] I am inclined to agree that at some point during the course of Ms. Young\u2019s experience of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s harassment, her fear and trauma (though I am not purporting to use that term in a clinical sense) may have given rise to a hypersensitivity to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s actions and motivation. To the extent that this heightened sensitivity impacted her perception and characterization of the incidents that she experienced, I have factored that into the weight I gave her testimony on certain points. However, I am not prepared to conclude that this makes her untrustworthy as a witness. I believe it is more appropriate to understand Ms. Young\u2019s testimony as being animated by a heightened sense of fear, which actually reinforces, rather than undermines, the fact that what she experienced was of a significant and traumatic nature.\n[197] Put another way, an event that someone else might characterize as a 3\/10 (in terms of the level of disturbance) is experienced by Ms. Young as a 7\/10. An example of this dynamic at play is in the September 5, 2012, incident at the fuel stand.\n[198] Having said that, in many instances, Ms. Young\u2019s evidence was corroborated by other witnesses and was further supported by VIA\u2019s own finding that Mr. Sawchuk was engaged in unprofessional conduct in breach of VIA\u2019s Code of Conduct (resulting in a significant disciplinary penalty). While we do not have the benefit of a written report arising from the investigation or a rationale for the decision to discipline Mr. Sawchuk for his breach of the Code of Conduct, I find that the evidence arising from VIA\u2019s internal investigation is more consistent with Ms. Young\u2019s version of events than Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s.\n[199] On a balance, the Tribunal finds that it is more likely than not that, overall, Mr. Sawchuk treated some female colleagues differently and more aggressively than his male colleagues.\n(b)Sex Was a Factor in Some Specific Incidents\n[200] In addition to the general evidence about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s attitudes towards women, some of the incidents alleged in Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint are implicitly gendered and are based in conduct that I find the reasonable woman in the same circumstances would experience as adverse treatment based on sex.\n[201] Specifically, I find that the incident where Mr. Sawchuk refused to move from behind Ms. Young, despite her discomfort and request that he do so, engaged issues of sex and Ms. Young\u2019s comfort in her female body, bending over in front of a male colleague.\n[202] Similarly, the allegation that Mr. Sawchuk placed himself on the ladder, climbing up from the ground, when Ms. Young was descending the ladder from the cab, engaged issues of sex and Ms. Young\u2019s comfort in her female body descending over the head\/face of Mr. Sawchuk.\n[203] Ms. Young also testified that, as a woman, she experienced a heightened sense of fear and vulnerability in the large industrial area where she and Mr. Sawchuk worked. Some areas of the TMC were not well lit, and Ms. Young described a sense of fear for her safety. Other witnesses, including Mr. Arsenault, testified that Ms. Young appeared afraid and uncomfortable being around Mr. Sawchuk in the train yard.\n[204] While the Tribunal would never suggest that this kind of fear is the universal experience of all women, or even that it is the only response that would be warranted in the circumstances that Ms. Young described in her submissions, I agree with Ms. Young\u2019s submission that, as a woman, the kind of fear she experienced, in the vast, dark industrial train yard at night had a distinct and different impact on her than it did on her male colleagues. Put another way, Ms. Young had a gendered experience of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards her given the nature of their work and work environment.\n[205] Perhaps more subtle are the allegations that pertain to being watched by a colleague with whom you have (at minimum) a strained relationship. Finally, as was described above, in workplaces that are characterized by historic privilege for one group over another, comments about gendered characteristics, such as a woman\u2019s voice or whether she is dressed appropriately for the workplace, also have a gendered element.\n[206] On the basis of the forgoing analysis, I find that Ms. Young\u2019s sex was a factor in Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s adverse treatment of her.\n[207] Having answered the three questions set out in Moore (whether Ms. Young has a protected prohibited ground of discrimination, whether she experienced an adverse impact and whether Ms. Young\u2019s protected prohibited ground of discrimination was a factor in the adverse impact) in the affirmative, I find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Young breached the Act by application of s. 7(b).\n2. Harassment on the Basis of Sex (s. 14(1)(c) of the CHRA) [208] Ms. Young and the Commission alleged that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct constituted harassment and as such was inconsistent with the protections afforded by s. 14 of the Act.\n[209] I do not propose to repeat the discussion on Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct as it has been outlined in detail above, and I have already made factual findings about the events alleged and the connection between those events and Ms. Young\u2019s identity as a woman. However, since harassment was specifically alleged by the Complainant and the Commission and since the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of a complaint under s. 14 differs somewhat from the test set out in Moore, for the purpose of completeness, the Tribunal will briefly review the elements of the test for establishing a breach of s. 14 of the Act and will consider the application of that test to the specific facts of this case.\n[210] The test for the application of s. 14(1)(c) was set out in Morin. Applying the four elements of the Morin test to this case, the Tribunal will determine whether:\nMr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct is related to Ms. Young\u2019s protected characteristic (sex);\nMr. Sawchuck\u2019s acts were unwelcome;\nMr. Sawchuck\u2019s conduct had the required element of persistence or any single incidence was serious enough to constitute harassment; and\nMs. Young notified VIA, the employer, of the alleged offensive conduct.\ni. Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s Conduct Was Related to Ms. Young\u2019s Sex\n[211] On the basis of the analysis outlined above regarding the connection between Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s sex, I find that at least some of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was related to a protected characteristic.\nii. Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s Conduct Was Unwelcome\n[212] As is extensively detailed above, Ms. Young repeatedly made it clear to Mr. Sawchuk and to VIA that his conduct was unwelcome and that she was uncomfortable around him. There was no suggestion before the Tribunal that this element of the test was not established.\niii. Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s Conduct Was Persistent\n[213] As discussed above, the series of events that underpin this Complaint constitute a lengthy and persistent course of conduct. Even where I have found that the evidence presented before the Tribunal is insufficient to ground a finding of fact, the evidence in this case leaves no question that Mr. Sawchuk was engaged in a persistent course of conduct that was unprofessional, inappropriate and unwelcome. This finding is further corroborated by the findings of VIA\u2019s own internal investigation into Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct, deeming it to be conduct unbecoming.\niv. Ms. Young Notified VIA About the Conduct\n[214] The parties agreed that the matter was brought to the attention of the employer.\n[215] VIA argued that it did not appreciate the severity of the complaints or see the problem as one of harassment when it initially received Ms. Young\u2019s January 2012 complaint (an issue which I will address in more detail below). It is accurate that, at the time the complaints were initially raised by Ms. Young, the situation was not nearly as serious as it would ultimately become before VIA took action. However, the Tribunal is satisfied that Ms. Young\u2019s initial letter of complaint, sent in January 2012, was sufficient to put VIA on notice of the existence of a problem between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk and the possibility of the Act being engaged, including more than one incident of unprofessional conduct. Having been made aware of the situation, VIA ought to have taken proactive steps to monitor the situation between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk to ensure that it did not continue to escalate. Instead, the evidence before the Tribunal suggests that Mr. Hamilton, who received Ms. Young\u2019s January 2012 complaint, saw the matter as resolved following his discussion with Mr. Sawchuk and took no further proactive steps to manage the situation.\n[216] Ms. Young went on to make a detailed complaint, in March 2013, including nine letters of complaint describing numerous incidents, before VIA finally initiated an investigation.\n[217] There is no question on the evidence before the Tribunal that VIA was notified of Ms. Young\u2019s concerns.\n[218] On the basis of the forgoing analysis, I find that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Young was harassment on the basis of sex, in breach of the protections of s. 14(1)(c) of the Act.\n3. Sexual Harassment (s. 14(2) of the CHRA) [219] At the hearing and in some of the closing submissions, the parties made reference to the Complaint as one of sexual harassment, and the Commission in particular made submissions in that regard.\n[220] I have already made findings with respect to harassment on the basis of sex as a characteristic protected under the s. 14(1)(c) of the Act, but I think it useful to also address the allegations of sexual harassment through consideration of the test set out in Franke.\n[221] The Tribunal will make a finding of sexual harassment where the evidence establishes that:\n1) a party engaged in unwelcome conduct;\n2) the impugned conduct is sexual in nature;\n3) there existed either a pattern of persistent conduct or a single serious incident; and\n4) the employee notified the employer of the alleged sexual harassment where the employer has a human resources department and a comprehensive and effective sexual harassment policy, including redress mechanisms in place.\n[222] I have already found that Mr. Sawchuk was engaged in a course of harassing conduct that represented discrimination against Ms. Young on the basis of her sex, and I do not intend to repeat that analysis here.\n[223] Mr. Sawchuk was engaged in a sustained and persistent pattern of unwelcome conduct that was, at least in part, related to Ms. Young\u2019s sex, satisfying the first and third elements of the test set out in Franke. I have also found that Ms. Young brought this conduct to the attention of her employer, as required by the fourth element of the test.\n[224] However, I am not satisfied on the balance of the evidence that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was sexual in nature.\n[225] The Commission, in its submissions, argued that sexual harassment does not need to be sexual in nature and suggested that it can include gender-related conduct that is directed at one sex and not the other, such as offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person\u2019s sex, gender-related comments about an individual\u2019s physical characteristics or gender-related verbal abuse.\n[226] It is clear that harassment on the basis of gender (or what the Act refers to as \u201csex\u201d) does not require conduct of a sexual nature, as I have already found to be the case in this Complaint. However, I think that clarity requires the distinction between gendered harassment (a form of discriminatory conduct related to a person\u2019s sex or gender in breach of s. 14(1)(c)) and sexual harassment (which, per s. 14(2), is a subset of harassment on the basis of sex, but which includes conduct of a sexual nature). I think it is important to distinguish between the two types of harassment: the latter being a distinct subset of the former.\n[227] While I have held that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct constitutes gendered harassment (or, to use the language of the Act, harassment on the basis of sex), I do not believe that the evidence presented at the hearing supports a finding that that harassment was of a sexual nature, in the manner that I believe is meant in s. 14(2) of the Act.\n[228] Therefore, I dismiss the allegations that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct represented a breach of the Act in the meaning of s. 14(2).\nB. VIA is Liable for the Discriminatory Conduct Under s. 65 of the CHRA [229] Having found that Mr. Sawchuck\u2019s workplace conduct breached the Act, the burden shifts to the Respondent, VIA, to demonstrate that it ought not be held responsible for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s actions.\n[230] Section 65 of the CHRA says that an employer is deemed responsible for the conduct of its employees unless it can be established that the employer:\nDid not consent to the conduct;\nExercised all due diligence to prevent the conduct; and\nExercised all due diligence to mitigate or avoid the full negative effects of the conduct of the employee.\n[231] The Tribunal\u2019s jurisprudence is evolving to be increasingly clear that, to avail itself of the protection afforded by s. 65, an employer would have to demonstrate that all three of these elements are present. In other words, these are not alternative defences. An employer must demonstrate that it has not consented to the conduct, has exercised due diligence to prevent the conduct and has also exercised all due diligence to mitigate or avoid the full negative effects of the conduct (See R. L. v. Canadian National Railway Company 2021 CHRT 33 at para 198, Aeropro at para 194).\n4. The Position of the Respondent [232] At the hearing, VIA introduced evidence documenting the existence of a harassment policy in place at the time of the events at issue. VIA also led evidence about the existence of various training courses provided to (and, in some cases, required of) its employees. And Ms. Selesnic, the VIA manager who conducted the internal investigation into Ms. Young\u2019s internal harassment complaint against Mr. Sawchuk, was called as a witness by Ms. Young. The Tribunal heard detailed evidence about the internal investigation that VIA eventually conducted and the discipline that was administered as a result.\n[233] Although the parties did not focus on this point at the hearing or in their submissions, I am prepared to infer from VIA\u2019s submissions that it takes the position that it did not expressly consent to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct, and its submissions can be understood to deny any suggestion to the contrary.\n[234] VIA argued that it diligently investigated, addressed and resolved each of the issues raised by Ms. Young, spending considerable time investigating the factual basis of the incidents that she raised. In its submissions, VIA highlighted Mr. Medeiros\u2019 evidence that he spent \u201cabout 100 hours\u201d listening to radio tapes and manually transcribing them in an effort to get to the bottom of Ms. Young\u2019s concerns.\n[235] VIA also argued that its \u201cexternal investigation\u201d (which was in fact internal to VIA but external to Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s team on the night shift at the TMC) followed the rules of procedural fairness and produced a meaningful process that was commensurate with the investigation\u2019s findings.\n[236] Finally, the Tribunal heard evidence about incremental restrictions that were placed upon Mr. Sawchuk, culminating in his removal from his role as a locomotive attendant on the night shift. VIA argued, in fact, that removing Mr. Sawchuk from Ms. Young\u2019s workplace to ensure that Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk were not in contact with each other exceeded any obligation it might have arising from the situation as an employer.\n[237] VIA argued that, while not legally required, the restrictions imposed on Mr. Sawchuk (including restrictions that would have encroached on his seniority rights under the applicable collective agreement) demonstrated its appreciation of the seriousness of the situation and its efforts to accommodate Ms. Young.\n[238] In its closing submissions, VIA relied on the CHRT\u2019s decision in Cassidy v. Canada Post Corporation and Raj Thambirajah, 2012 CHRT 29 (CanLII) [Cassidy] to support its argument that while its response may not have been perfect, it had nonetheless adequately discharged its obligation to exercise due diligence both before and in response to the events described in the Complaint.\n5. The Position of the Commission [239] In its closing submissions, the Commission focussed on two primary areas of concern regarding VIA\u2019s response to Ms. Young\u2019s complaints about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct: i. delay; and ii. flaws in the investigation process.\ni. Delay [240] The Commission argued that VIA failed to discharge its obligation to promptly investigate Ms. Young\u2019s concerns about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct, waiting over a year from the date of the initial complaint (in January 2012) before a serious effort was made to investigate.\nii. Flaws in the Investigation Process [241] The Commission raised further concerns about the way in which the investigation was conducted, highlighting the fact that Ms. Selesnic\u2019s description of her mandate as collecting information rather than conducting a harassment investigation, is inconsistent with the Commission\u2019s view of what is required of a diligent investigation.\n[242] The Commission concludes that VIA failed to discharge its duty under s. 65 of the Act to conduct a timely, thorough and fair investigation of the allegations and put in place an appropriate solution.\n6. The Position of the Complainant [243] Ms. Young highlighted numerous concerns with VIA\u2019s response to her complaints about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct throughout the hearing, particularly with regard to VIA\u2019s identification, response and remediation of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s harassment of Ms. Young. The areas of concern included:\n(a) The managers\u2019 ability to properly recognize harassment, including the gendered nature of some of the incidences outlined in the Complaint;\n(b) The sufficiency of the training provided to individuals who conduct investigations;\n(c) The delay in initiating the investigation; and\nA lack of transparency in the investigative process (including the shift from a harassment complaint to a Code of Conduct violation), and, importantly, the lack of any written documentation of the findings of the investigation (whether or not they were to be provided to the party who initiated the investigation).\n[244] In her closing submissions, Ms. Young acknowledged that the harassment policy itself was thorough and well worded.\n7. Analysis of the Respondent\u2019s Liability for the Discriminatory Conduct\n[245] The Act is clear that an employer is liable for the discriminatory workplace conduct of its employee. Section 65(1) of the Act states:\nSubject to subsection (2), any act or omission committed by an officer, a director, an employee or an agent of any person, association or organization in the course of the employment of the officer, director, employee or agent shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be an act or omission committed by that person, association or organization.\n[246] There was no dispute before me about the fact that the conduct detailed in Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint was conducted by an employee in the course of their employment.\n[247] Section 65(2) of the Act provides an exception to this deemed liability:\nAn act or omission shall not, by virtue of subsection (1), be deemed to be an act or omission committed by a person, association or organization if it is established that the person, association or organization did not consent to the commission of the act or omission and exercised all due diligence to prevent the act or omission from being committed and, subsequently, to mitigate or avoid the effect thereof.\n[248] To meet this threshold, the response must be timely, mitigative and preventative.\n[249] In the event the Tribunal were to substantiate Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint that she was the subject of discriminatory conduct in contravention of the Act, VIA invoked s. 65(2) of the Act as a defence against what would otherwise be liability for the act of an employee, pursuant to s. 65(1).\n[250] The burden of proof rests on the respondent to demonstrate that it did not consent to the impugned conduct and that it acted with all due diligence to both prevent and mitigate the effects of the impugned conduct (see Aeropro at paras 208 and following)\nSummary of the Relevant Facts\n[251] For the most part, the material facts surrounding VIA\u2019s response to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Young were not in dispute.\n[252] VIA had a harassment policy in place at the time of the relevant incidents.\n[253] VIA provided training with respect to the harassment policy to its employees.\n[254] In January 2012, Ms. Young first raised concerns about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct (being watched, photographed and sworn at by Mr. Sawchuk) to VIA management in a letter dated January 12, 2012. More than a month passed before VIA responded, and on February 17, 2012, Ms. Young testified that the manager who addressed Ms. Young\u2019s complaint engaged with the individuals involved in an informal manner and warned Mr. Sawchuk to \u201cact more professionally in the future\u201d, to which Mr. Sawchuk reluctantly agreed.\n[255] Despite Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s reluctant agreement, VIA did not provide any evidence that it followed up or took any steps to make sure that Mr. Sawchuk was indeed acting more professionally. Instead, as has been detailed extensively in these reasons, the situation continued to deteriorate. This deterioration is sometimes, but not always, brought to the attention of VIA management.\n[256] The situation came to a head 14 months after Ms. Young\u2019s first letter of complaint.\n[257] On March 7, 2013, Ms. Young notified Mr. Hamilton that she was no longer willing to work with Mr. Sawchuk. Whether or not a formal work refusal was filed, in the meaning of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, Ms. Young characterized the event in those terms. Mr. Hamilton told Ms. Young that she had to put her concerns in writing with supporting evidence.\n[258] On March 13, 2013, Ms. Young submitted nine letters of complaint, detailing the events described in these reasons and alleging that Mr. Sawchuk had engaged in inappropriate and unsafe conduct.\n[259] On March 21, 2013, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Medeiros met with Ms. Young. Despite the wide range of incidents detailed in the letters of complaint, the focus of the meeting was the radio transmissions pertaining to some of the incidents raised in Ms. Young\u2019s March 13 complaint. VIA\u2019s harassment policy and mediation process were also discussed at this meeting.\n[260] Ms. Young was clear that she did not want to be in a meeting with Mr. Sawchuk and was uncomfortable proceeding with mediation.\n[261] Both Ms. Young and Mr. Medeiros testified that Mr. Medeiros appeared to be distressed about the allegations and the fact that she had not come to him earlier.\n[262] The union became involved, and a decision was made to remove Mr. Sawchuk from the evening shift at the TMC, effective April 23, 2013.\n[263] VIA also decided to proceed to a formal investigation at this time.\n[264] On April 18, 2013, Ms. Selesnic initiated an extensive fact-finding investigation into the complaints that had been raised by Ms. Young and sent a notice to Ms. Young to that effect. Ms. Young was again asked to provide further clarification of her complaints to VIA.\n[265] Mr. Hamilton provided a statement in the context of Ms. Selesnic\u2019s investigation in which he stated that he was aware that Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young did not get along but that he was not aware \u201cthat any harassment was taking place\u201d and noted that \u201cno further written complaints\u201d were received between January 12, 2012, and March 13, 2013.\n[266] Ms. Selesnic interviewed eleven VIA employees, including Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk. Ms. Young testified that her interview with Ms. Selesnic took over two 12-hour days.\n[267] At some point during the investigation process, a decision was made that Ms. Young\u2019s harassment complaint would be adjudicated as a complaint under the Code of Conduct. There was no explanation provided at the hearing as to when or why the decision was made, or who made it. And I do not have sufficient evidence to make any findings with regard to those facts.\n[268] The testimony regarding the conclusion of the investigation was unclear. However, I am able to find that, at the end of her investigation, Ms. Selesnic made a verbal report to Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton. VIA repeatedly advised that there was no written record of the findings or conclusions of the investigation.\n[269] Ms. Selesnic testified that she was not involved in the decision about what conclusion would be drawn from the extensive investigation that she conducted. She further testified that despite having conducted the investigation, she did not make findings with respect to the allegations. Mr. Medeiros testified that he was directly involved in deciding what would happen as a result of Ms. Selesnic\u2019s investigation. The Tribunal reviewed an email from Ms. Blair, which summarized VIA\u2019s actions coming out of the investigation, but, during her testimony, Ms. Blair\u2019s evidence was that Mr. Medeiros made the decisions about what, if any, disciplinary action would arise as a result of the investigation and Ms. Blair determined any other corporate responses that would arise, including training or policy changes.\n[270] In late June 2013, Ms. Young had a meeting with Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton at which time Ms. Young was advised that the investigation was complete and that Mr. Sawchuk had been disciplined. Ms. Young testified that she was satisfied at this point that the matter had been addressed.\n[271] Ms. Young testified that she requested a copy of Ms. Selesnic\u2019s report but was not provided a copy. She testified that, at the time, she was told that Ms. Selesnic was away and that her report was not available. VIA subsequently advised the Tribunal and the parties that no such report exists.\n[272] Ms. Young testified that on July 15, 2013, Mr. Medeiros wrote to her to provide the results of the investigation. The July 15 letter was presented in evidence at the hearing, and the Commission included the following excerpt in its closing submissions:\nPursuant to the examination of the facts ad the statements taken, I wish to inform that it was not possible to establish the allegations you made in your complaint. However, the appropriate corrective measure was taken toward Mr. Sawchuk. Please take note that management will monitor that the Code of Conduct and Harassment Policy are respected in the workplace. Mr. Sawchuk was advised of our conclusions and that any further instances of harassment, intimidation or retaliation shall be considered as misconduct and will not be tolerated.\n[273] Following the investigation, Mr. Sawchuk was awarded 25 demerit points, and further measures were put in place to prevent any recurrence of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct.\n[274] While the steps taken by VIA following the investigation did not entirely eliminate any issues between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk, I find that the measures taken following the Selesnic investigation were a reasonable if belated response in the circumstances.\nAnalysis of VIA\u2019s Response to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s Discriminatory Conduct\n[275] At the hearing and in their closing submissions, the Complainant and the Commission focussed on two areas in which they allege that the Respondent failed to act with due diligence in respect of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct:\nThe long delay in the start of a formal investigation; and\nThe procedure employed in the investigation itself.\n[276] As I have outlined above, to avail itself of the exemption from statutory liability for the conduct of an employee, VIA must establish on a balance of probabilities that (i) it did not consent to the impugned conduct; (ii) it acted with all due diligence to prevent the impugned conduct; and (iii) it acted with all due diligence to mitigate the impact of the impugned conduct.\n[277] As VIA and the Commission correctly argued in their respective closing submissions, the standard is not one of perfection but one of reasonableness (Laskowska v. Marineland of Canada Ltd., 2005 HRTO 30 [Laskowska] at para 60).\n(i) Did VIA consent to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct?\n[278] Although the terms of the 2007-harassment policy were in evidence before the Tribunal, the policy itself was not the subject of much testimony or dispute. The parties conceded that VIA\u2019s policy was adequate and that VIA, as an organization, does not condone or consent to harassment or discrimination.\n[279] The evidence before me at the hearing with respect to the fact and frequency of training was inconsistent, and it was clear from the evidence before the Tribunal that many VIA employees, managers included, do not have a nuanced understanding of workplace human rights and the requirements of a discrimination-free working environment.\n[280] The inability of more than one manager to recognize the gendered nature of Ms. Young\u2019s concerns and the way in which her experience of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was being impacted by her identity as a woman leads me to conclude that more work and training are required to ensure that issues of discrimination are being readily recognized in the workplace.\n[281] In any event, although I have found that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was in fact discriminatory, I am convinced that VIA, and particularly Mr. Medeiros, was concerned about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct despite not understanding it to be discriminatory at the time. The delay in VIA\u2019s formal response to Ms. Young\u2019s complaint is concerning as is the fact that a number of Ms. Young\u2019s concerns (expressed directly to management, albeit not in writing) and Mr. Dor\u00e9\u2019s concerns about Mr. Sawchuk appear based on the evidence before me to have gone unanswered. This delay has contributed to my finding (below) that VIA failed to exercise due diligence to prevent Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. However, I am prepared to conclude on the basis of the evidence before me that VIA did not consent to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct.\n(ii) Did VIA exercise due diligence to prevent Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s discriminatory conduct?\n[282] The situation described in these reasons is not one that should have required a formal written complaint for the employer to become involved or to engage its obligations under the Act. While a written complaint can be helpful in considering issues of discrimination, several witnesses, including Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton, appeared to be under the impression that, unless a formal written complaint was received by VIA management, there was nothing that they could do about Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. Notwithstanding the content of any VIA policy or protocol, that understanding is not consistent with the obligations of an employer under the Act.\n[283] Ms. Young made her initial complaint in January 2012. Clearly, the situation described in that initial complaint is much less serious than the many incidents included in the March 2013 complaint, but it is partly through VIA\u2019s own inaction that the situation worsened in the way that it did. Had VIA engaged more rigorously at the time of the initial complaint and acted more proactively to ensure that the relationship between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk did not continue to deteriorate, it is unlikely that the situation would have become as serious as it did.\n[284] The various concerns that were raised throughout the period from January 2012 to March 2013, including those concerns raised in the Dor\u00e9 Memo, were not taken sufficiently seriously, and it does not appear that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and the deteriorating relationship between he and Ms. Young were being diligently addressed to prevent what was, at least in part, discriminatory conduct within the workplace.\n[285] VIA has failed to discharge its burden to demonstrate that it exercised all due diligence necessary to prevent the discriminatory conduct.\n(iii) Did VIA exercise all due diligence to mitigate or avoid the full negative effects of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct?\n[286] It is in this phase of the analysis that I will consider the sufficiency of VIA\u2019s investigation and address the numerous concerns that were raised by the Commission and the Complainant about that process.\n[287] As mentioned above, the employer\u2019s duty to investigate is held to a standard of reasonableness, not correctness or perfection. In Laskowska, the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (HRTO) set out the relevant criteria for an employer to consider its duty to investigate as:\n(1) Awareness of issues of discrimination\/harassment, Policy Complaint Mechanism and Training: Was there an awareness of issues of discrimination and harassment in the workplace at the time of the incident? Was there a suitable anti-discrimination\/harassment policy? Was there a proper complaint mechanism in place? Was adequate training given to management and employees;\n(2) Post-Complaint: Seriousness, Promptness, Taking Care of its Employee, Investigation and Action: Once an internal complaint was made, did the employer treat it seriously? Did it deal with the matter promptly and sensitively? Did it reasonably investigate and act; and\n(3) Resolution of the Complaint (including providing the Complainant with a Healthy Work Environment) and Communication: Did the employer provide a reasonable resolution in the circumstances? If the complainant chose to return to work, could the employer provide him\/her with a healthy, discrimination-free work environment? Did it communicate its findings and actions to the complainant?\n[288] The HRTO in Laskowska also stated the following at para. 60:\nWhile the above three elements are of a general nature, their application must retain some flexibility to take into account the unique facts of each case. The standard is one of reasonableness, not correctness or perfection. There may have been several options \u2013 all reasonable \u2013 open to the employer. The employer need not satisfy each element in every case in order to be judged to have acted reasonably, although that would be the exception rather than the norm. One must look at each element individually and then in the aggregate before passing judgment on whether the employer acted reasonably.\n[289] In considering whether VIA\u2019s response to the conduct at issue in the complaint met the requirement to reasonably exercise all due diligence, there are two main problems identified by the Complainant and the Commission:\nIt took too long to intervene in a dangerous and deteriorating situation; and\nThe formal investigation fell short of the transparency and documentation necessary in the situation.\n[290] Applying the Laskowska factors adopted by the Tribunal in Cassidy, we see that although VIA\u2019s ultimate response to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was successful in eliminating the discriminatory impact of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct upon Ms. Young, it came after months of escalating harm. The investigation process employed by VIA in respect of the complaint leaves serious questions about transparency, independence and systemic considerations, leaving doubt about whether all due diligence was exercised to mitigate and avoid the harm arising from the discriminatory conduct.\n[291] The Tribunal\u2019s ability to assess the adequacy of the investigation process is limited as a result of the lack of documentation regarding VIA\u2019s investigation process and of the details of this specific investigation. There was little if any evidence provided about the consideration and deliberation undertaken in response to information gathered by Ms. Selesnic, the weight that was given to the various statements taken, and how the decision was made that Mr. Sawchuk had violated the Code of Conduct and was found to have engaged in \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d, though it appears from the evidence that the decision was made by Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton following a briefing from the investigator, Ms. Selesnic.\n[292] While the collection of statements was undertaken by an investigator outside of the TMC, it appears from the uncontradicted evidence that the final decision about what would happen as a result of the investigation was not made independently but was made by Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton, with broader organizational issues being considered and addressed by Ms. Blair (though there was no evidence that any organizational or systemic changes were made as a result of this investigation).\n[293] This lack of independent decision-making is clearly not consistent with an independent investigation, particularly given that one of the areas of concern that has been raised before me (and that Ms. Young testified that she raised at the time) was about the inaction of VIA management, including Mr. Medeiros and Mr. Hamilton, in the 14 months following her initial complaint.\n[294] Although Ms. Young purported to file a harassment complaint, it does not appear that the formal harassment policy was engaged, and the evidence before me leads me to conclude that, at some point in the process, a decision was made that Ms. Young\u2019s complaint did not engage the harassment policy. The Commission argued that VIA did not conduct an investigation under its harassment policy.\n[295] The Tribunal\u2019s ability to make findings about what happened during the course of the investigation is severely limited due to the lack of documentary evidence produced. This, in and of itself, is a flaw in the investigation process. But, as the burden to demonstrate that VIA exercised all due diligence rests with the Respondent, this lack of evidence makes it difficult for VIA to satisfy this aspect of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis.\n[296] While there is no doubt that the interview process was thorough and comprehensive, the Tribunal has no evidence that the decision-making process was equally rigorous. Ultimately, in absence of a written report or clear testimony explaining the outcome of the investigation, the reasons for the decision not to substantiate the harassment allegations, the decision to frame the complaint in terms of the Code of Conduct, or the disciplinary consequences that would be awarded as a result of the investigation, or, what went so very wrong in this case, and any changes that VIA might adopt in order to prevent any future reoccurrence either with Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young, or any other employees, the Tribunal cannot satisfy itself that the investigation meets the necessary standards of due diligence.\n[297] With respect to the measures eventually put in place to address what VIA had determined to be \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d, the Tribunal finds that, from the period of June 2013 to December 2013, VIA engaged in progressively more restrictive measures to create distance between Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk, ultimately culminating in the removal of Mr. Sawchuk from the night shift.\n[298] The Tribunal finds that these measures were responsive to the seriousness of the situation and were ultimately effective in preventing the discriminatory conduct by removing the offending party.\n[299] However, the Tribunal notes that it does not appear that any steps were taken to address Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s apparent lack of understanding about the nature of his conduct. Even as he testified before the Tribunal, several years after the events at issue, Mr. Sawchuk appeared to be totally unaware of any wrongdoing on his part and claimed that he had never received an explanation of what he had done to warrant the discipline that he received or the fact that he had been forced to change to the day shift.\n[300] While the source of the conflict was effectively eliminated, Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s testimony leaves open the question of whether the source of that conflict was meaningfully remedied or simply relocated.\n[301] While I reiterate that the standard against which an investigation will be adjudicated is not one of perfection but one of reasonableness, there are structural and process flaws present in the approach employed in this case that present an insurmountable challenge for VIA in discharging its burden to show that it exercised all due diligence, either to prevent or mitigate the harm arising from Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. For the foregoing reasons, I find that VIA has failed to prove that it more likely than not exercised all due diligence in respect of the issues raised in this Complaint.\nC. Compensation and Policy Remedies Are Required to Prevent Reoccurrence [302] Having substantiated the Complaint and found that VIA is not able to avail itself of the protection arising from s. 65(2) of the Act, I will now consider the remedies available pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s remedial and preventative jurisdiction established by s. 53 of the Act.\n[303] Ms. Young included a number of remedial requests that go beyond the scope of what the Tribunal can award, pursuant to its authority under the Act, including damages awarded pursuant to the Workplace Violence Policy or occupational health and safety legislation and the removal of stipulations in relation to discipline awarded outside of the matters adjudicated before the Tribunal\n[304] Ms. Young and the Commission have, between them, identified five types of remedy that could be ordered by the Tribunal against VIA: (1) damages for injury to dignity; (2) damages for willful and reckless conduct; (3) compensation for lost wages; (4) costs incurred in pursuit of the Complaint; (5) interest payable on the amounts awarded; and (6) policy remedies.\n1. Compensation for Pain and Suffering Pursuant to s. 53(2)(e) of the CHRA\n[305] Ms. Young is claiming the maximum amount of $20,000.00 for the pain and suffering resulting from Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s harassment and the adverse treatment she experienced during her employment under paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA.\n[306] The Commission did not take a position with respect to the appropriate quantum of special damages to be awarded in this case, noting only that an award of special compensation was warranted in this case.\n[307] The Tribunal has historically exercised its discretion in the adjudication of damages and awarded the maximum amount allowed under the CHRA, $20,000.00, for the most blatant cases of complaints (Premakumar v. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, April 4, 2002; Aeropro, at paragraph 272). In addition, as has been noted several times in this decision in other respects, the complainant must demonstrate the causal connection between the damages claimed and the discriminatory practice (Chopra v. Canada (Attorney General), 2007 FCA 268, at paragraph 32 [Chopra]).\n[308] Damages for pain and suffering are intended to compensate the complainant, to the extent possible, for the harm they have endured and the hardship they have experienced as a result of the discrimination, including any injury to their dignity (Nielsen v. Nee Tahi Buhn Indian Band, 2019 CHRT 50, at paragraph 142; Beattie and Bangloy v. Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, 2019 CHRT 45 (CanLII), at paragraph 206 [Beattie and Bangloy]; First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada), 2019 CHRT 39 (CanLII), at paragraph 223).\n[309] The Tribunal is convinced that Ms. Young experienced pain and suffering as a result of the discrimination she suffered.\n[310] In her closing submissions, Ms. Young described her experience of fear, crying, increasing anxiety and stress as her concerns went unaddressed by VIA management. Ms. Young described the impact of such experience on her life outside of work as a mother in a manner that appeared sincere and heartfelt.\n[311] At the hearing, the Tribunal was also able to observe what appeared to be the effects of the harassment and discrimination experienced by Ms. Young, even years later in the context of this proceeding. She sometimes had trouble being present in the hearing and appeared at times to be distressed and overwhelmed by the experience and by the evidence she was hearing. In addition, Ms. Young\u2019s testimony at the hearing was emotional and credible in terms of the impact that these events have had on her. When she told her story and talked about the events described in her complaint, it was clearly very difficult for her, and she (at times) appeared to want to physically withdraw into herself.\n[312] It was evident to the Tribunal that the ongoing trauma and fear that Ms. Young felt as a result of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct impacted her experience of the events around her and caused her deep distress. I also note that Ms. Young was angry, testifying that she had repeatedly asked for help and support from her employer, but for a long time, none was given.\n[313] Ms. Young\u2019s distress and frustration arising from her experience were palpable and were clearly demonstrated throughout the hearing process. While Ms. Young did not present medical evidence pertaining to her mental health, her testimony at the hearing left little doubt that the events described in her Complaint were serious and ongoing and had impacted her dignity and sense of well-being.\n[314] Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s actions and the delay in VIA\u2019s response compounded the harm Ms. Young experienced as a result of her continued stress and fear and were an affront to her dignity.\n[315] The pain and suffering are clear to the Tribunal, and it does not need any more convincing of the causal connection between Ms. Young\u2019s pain and suffering and the discriminatory practices (Chopra, above).\n[316] Given the seriousness of the events and their significant impact on the Complainant, who, even at the time of the hearing, still appeared to be suffering from the consequences of the harassment and discrimination, the amount of $12,000 is appropriate in the circumstances (paragraph 53(2)(e) of the CHRA).\n2. Compensation for Willful or Reckless Conduct Pursuant to s. 53(3) of the CHRA\n[317] The Complainant requested $20,000\u2014the maximum amount allowable under s. 53(3) of the CHRA\u2014in special damages against VIA arising from its reckless conduct.\n[318] The Tribunal spent 19 days hearing evidence about the workplace in which Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk were employed, and the testimony provided gave rise to serious concerns about the Respondent\u2019s level of tolerance for abusive and inappropriate workplace conduct. While a good deal of the conduct referred to was outside of the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s authority arising from the Complaint, and therefore beyond the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, I find that VIA management did repeatedly fail to intervene in a situation that was clearly not functioning in an appropriate manner\u2014and that situation has been found to be related to discriminatory conduct on the part of Mr. Sawchuk, VIA\u2019s employee. Even if VIA was unable to recognize that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct was discriminatory, there was no meaningful attempt to argue that the conduct was not deeply problematic and the relationship between employees on the night shift at the TMC deeply dysfunctional.\n[319] The fact that a festering conflict in the workplace between what was repeatedly referred to as \u201cfactions\u201d was dismissed by management as a \u201cfamily squabble\u201d is deeply troubling to the Tribunal.\n[320] In Cassidy, at paragraph 192, the Tribunal wrote the following:\nThe goal of the CHRA and other anti-discrimination human rights statutes is to \u201cmake a complainant whole\u201d, to put that person in a position s\/he would have been in \u201cbut for the discrimination\u201d the complainant suffered. The CHRA is a remedial statute. Its goal is to compensate, not punish a respondent. That said, aggravating (as opposed to punitive) and mitigating factors are relevant to the award of compensation. The remedy must be reasonable and have a nexus or causal link to the discriminatory practice found to have occurred.\n[321] In addition, in First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada), 2015 CHRT 14 (CanLII), the Tribunal wrote, at paragraph 22:\nThe Federal Court has interpreted this section as being a \u201c\u2026punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate\u201d (Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113, at para. 155, aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 110 [Johnstone FC]). A finding of wilfulness requires \u201c\u2026the discriminatory act and the infringement of the person\u2019s rights under the Act is intentional\u201d (Johnstone FC, at para. 155). Recklessness involves \u201c\u2026acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly\u201d (Johnstone FC, at para. 155).\n[322] It should be added that, when the Tribunal decides whether to award special compensation, it analyzes the respondent\u2019s actions or inaction, not the effects of those actions on the complainant (Beattie and Bangloy, at paragraph 210).\n[323] In this case, the Respondent\u2019s conduct was not of such a nature as to warrant an award of special damages at the high end of the range, as requested by Ms. Young. However, I am satisfied that VIA\u2019s diminishing of the abusive and dangerous conduct within the workplace during the night shift and its delay in providing an effective and comprehensive response to what was an increasingly toxic and harmful workplace dynamic was \u201cindifferent to the consequences.\u201d And that indifference allowed conduct that has been found to be discriminatory to persist for too long.\n[324] Since much of the most egregious conduct described before the Tribunal fell outside the scope of the adjudication of this complaint, and since I believe that the connection between Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and Ms. Young\u2019s identity as a woman was perhaps not obvious to VIA at the time that Ms. Young raised her complaints, the Tribunal\u2019s award of special damages under s. 53(3) of the CHRA will be limited to $3000.\n3. Damages for Lost Wages Pursuant to s. 53(2)(c) of the CHRA\nLost Overtime\n[325] The Complainant argued that, as a result of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s harassment and the restrictions that were subsequently imposed on Mr. Sawchuk and Ms. Young working together arising from that harassment, she lost the ability to work overtime shifts that she would have worked over a period of seven years.\n[326] VIA argued that although the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to award lost wages, no such award should be made in this case as the losses were not proven. Rather, VIA submits that Ms. Young made a personal choice to work less overtime than she had in the past. VIA also asserted that Ms. Young\u2019s claim was asserted without precise evidence and that the Respondent was not liable for any wage loss.\n[327] The Commission did not make closing submissions with respect to lost overtime, instead relying on its Statement of Particulars.\n[328] Ms. Young testified that, starting in March or April 2012, she began to refuse overtime shifts to avoid working with Mr. Sawchuk. This testimony was supported by the documents tendered before the Tribunal.\n[329] Ms. Young also testified that at a certain point she was being skipped on the overtime call list, which Mr. Medeiros verified in his testimony (though the two witnesses disagreed about the frequency of this occurrence). There were some documents entered in evidence at the hearing that also support the conclusion that, at least in some cases, starting in the first part of 2013, Ms. Young was being skipped on the overtime call list, and I am convinced that, when this happened, it was related to VIA\u2019s decision to ensure that Ms. Young and Mr. Sawchuk were not working together.\n[330] I also heard evidence from several other witnesses who worked at the TMC at the relevant time who testified that overtime was a fairly regular part of their work and that there were generally lots of overtime shifts available for locomotive attendants. This testimony was not contradicted by any other witnesses.\n[331] In fact, whether Ms. Young missed out on overtime work because she was unable to be sure of her own safety on the job or because VIA had elected not to offer her overtime as a result of the concerns she had raised about Mr. Sawchuk, it is more likely than not that Ms. Young missed out on overtime shifts in 2012 and 2013 as a result of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct.\n[332] Ms. Young has claimed damages for lost overtime over a period of seven years, though the evidence as to the amount claimed is somewhat speculative and inconsistent.\n[333] While I have found that the overtime missed after the first quarter of 2012 and through 2013 can reasonably be attributed to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and VIA\u2019s response to that conduct, by the end of 2013, I have found that the measures that VIA had put in place constituted a sufficient response to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. While I appreciate that Ms. Young may have continued to have concerns about taking overtime shifts after 2013, the evidence supports a finding that VIA had addressed the conduct in such a way that Ms. Young should have been able to return to a normal pattern of work with a high degree of confidence that she would not be working with Mr. Sawchuk, who had been transferred to the day shift.\n[334] The Tribunal has jurisdiction flowing from s. 53(2)(c) of the Act to award damages for lost overtime where it finds that this loss flows from the discriminatory conduct.\n[335] In this case, I have concluded that Ms. Young lost overtime shifts in the last three quarters of 2012 through 2013 as a result of the discriminatory conduct that she experienced, either because she refused those shifts to avoid working with Mr. Sawchuk or because she was passed over by VIA on the overtime calling list.\n[336] It is very difficult to establish with certainty what Ms. Young would have done if VIA had been able to address Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct earlier, how much overtime would Ms. Young have been offered, or how often would she have accepted those shifts.\n[337] There were weaknesses in Ms. Young\u2019s evidence and a certain degree of speculation or uncertainty about what would have happened were it not for Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct. However, given my findings that Ms. Young did suffer a loss of overtime as a result of the discriminatory conduct, the Tribunal\u2019s response to the uncertainty ought not be to throw up its proverbial hands (Kelsh v. Canadian Pacific, 2019 CHRT 51 at para 153). Instead, as the Federal Court of Appeal adopted in Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada Post Corporation (2010 FCA 56, affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2011 SCC 57), Professor Waddams claims that the appropriate response is for the Tribunal to do the best it can with the evidence it has:\nIf the amount [of a loss] is difficult to estimate, the tribunal must simply do its best on the material available, though of course if the plaintiff has not adduced evidence that might have been expected to be adduced if the claim were sound, the omission will tell against the plaintiff.\n[338] The evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates that, in 2011, Ms. Young earned $3634.20 in overtime pay. While it may be an imperfect proxy, the full year prior to the start of the events described in Ms. Young\u2019s Complaint will serve as the base for my damages calculations. Therefore, I award Ms. Young damages for lost overtime in the following amounts:\n2012 (for \u00be of the year): $2725.65\n2013 (for the full year): $3634.20\nfor a total of $6359.85.\nLost Chance to Be Promoted\n[339] Ms. Young alleged that she lost out on an opportunity to be promoted as a result of the Complaint. Ms. Young testified that she would have received the promotion but for the fact that she had complained about Mr. Sawchuk.\n[340] Ms. Young\u2019s closing submissions include a claim under s. 53(2)(c) for\nfuture earnings of $920,000 lost because she was not considered for a management position due to her Complaint, and a loss of increased salary of $27,000 per year for a period of 23 years as a result of discrimination that was left to fester for a total amount of lost future earnings of $621,000.\n[341] Although Ms. Young provided some evidence about what she alleged to be the loss of an opportunity to compete in job competitions and her relative seniority or experience in relation to the successful candidates, I have very little testimony or documentary evidence to support her claims that she would have been entitled to be considered for a promotion but was not included. Ms. Young\u2019s claim rests on her speculation about why she was not included in a given hiring pool or chosen for a specific job.\n[342] I am also mindful of the evidence that the TMC is a unionized workplace, and Ms. Young is represented by a union. Without clear evidence about the employment opportunity, the collective agreement, the hiring process or the factors that would have bearing on any job opportunity, I am not prepared to find that Ms. Young lost the opportunity to compete for a promotion or lost a promotion as a result.\n[343] Neither VIA nor the Commission made submissions on this point.\n[344] While the Tribunal has the jurisdiction under the Act to award damages for any loss that flows from the discriminatory conduct, including the loss of a promotion if a causal connection can be drawn between the discriminatory conduct and the loss claimed, I am not satisfied on the basis of the evidence provided at the hearing that Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct is the reason Ms. Young was not awarded a promotion or was not included in the pool for any given opportunity at VIA.\n[345] Therefore, the Tribunal does not have sufficient evidence to make an award of damages flowing from the claim of a lost promotion.\n4. Costs Incurred in Pursuit of the Complaint\n[346] The Complainant provided considerable documentation of the expenses she has incurred in the long journey of bringing her Complaint to the Tribunal and asserted a claim for $15,580 in administration and litigation costs associated with bringing her Complaint before the Tribunal. (Although the total included in Ms. Young\u2019s written submissions was $158,805, I believe this was a typographical error because the amounts listed in her closing submission actually add up to a total amount of $15,580).\n[347] VIA highlighted the case of Stanger v. Canada Post Corporation (2018 CHRT 14 at paras 43-45 [Stanger]) to argue that the Complainant\u2019s claim for an award of costs incurred in pursuit of the Complaint is outside of the Tribunal\u2019s remedial jurisdiction under s. 53.\n[348] The Commission did not take a position on this issue.\n[349] In Stanger, the Tribunal ruled:\n[43] Ms. Stanger has submitted various receipts for what she describes as \u201cexpenses that the complainant incurred in bringing forward\u201d her complaint. The receipts are for items such as photocopies, postage, cell phone charges, binders, tabs and paper, and parking and meals while attending the hearing in Victoria.\n[44] In Grant v. Manitoba Telecon Services Inc. (sic) 2012 CHRT 20 (CanLII) (\u201cGrant\u201d), the Tribunal considered a similar request at para 20:\n[20] The Complainant seeks compensation with regards to the expenses she incurred related to the hearing of this matter, and filed an expense chart in this regard at the July 10, 2012 hearing. The Complainant seeks $2,000 for lodging, meals, parking, and travel. In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (CanLII) [Mowat], the Supreme Court of Canada found that the text, context and purpose if the Act clearly showed that there was no authority in the Tribunal to award legal costs. According to the same reasoning in Mowat, and considering there is no link between the particular types of compensation described in s. 53 and the costs claimed by the complainant here, I fail to see any authority in the Act that would allow the Tribunal to award compensation for the expenses that the Complainant incurred in relation to the hearing of this matter. Therefore, no compensation can be provided for these costs.\n[45] I agree with the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Grant, supra, based on the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s reasoning in Mowat, supra, in that the Act does not intend for these administrative costs, incurred in connection with presenting the complaint at hearing and beforehand, to reimbursed under section 53. Accordingly, I do not award any amount for the administrative expenses claimed.\n[350] The Tribunal is the master of its own procedure and must have latitude to ensure that hearings being conducted before it are conducted in a manner that advances and safeguards both due process and human dignity. The law is clear that the CHRT does not have the authority to provide a cost award to the successful party in the manner sought by the Complainant (Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (CanLII), Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 20 (CanLII) 2012 CHRT 20).\n[351] The Tribunal recognizes the extraordinary cost (in human and financial terms) that a hearing entails for all parties involved. The Tribunal further recognizes that an inability to recover the costs of participating in a hearing may limit the ability of parties to fully engage in the hearing process. Nevertheless, the Tribunal\u2019s recognition of this gap does not enable it to craft a remedy where it lacks the statutory authority to do so.\n[352] While there may be a place for a cost award arising from the conduct of the parties in a hearing before the Tribunal in some circumstances, this is not such a case. Despite my finding that VIA failed to adequately prevent or respond to Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s conduct and as such is liable under the Act, there is no suggestion (nor is there any basis whatsoever in the evidence) that VIA participated in the hearing before the Tribunal with anything less than the utmost good faith and collegiality.\n[353] I am aware of the heavy burden that is borne by an individual who brings forward a complaint to safeguard their rights under the CHRA and in fact to all parties to a proceeding before the Tribunal. And it is not lost upon me that most ordinary Canadians do not have the resources required to retain a lawyer for the arduous process of litigating a human rights complaint. As Ms. Young\u2019s submissions illustrate, even without retaining a lawyer, human rights proceedings are long, complex and expensive.\n[354] That being said, the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s analysis of the CHRA leaves no margin for debate in a case like this. The Tribunal does not have the statutory authority to award litigation costs (including administrative costs) as a matter of course to the successful party.\n[355] Therefore, Ms. Young\u2019s claim for the costs associated with bringing forward and litigating her Complaint is denied.\n5. Interest (s. 53(4) of the CHRA)\n[356] As requested by the Commission in its Statement of Particulars, the Tribunal concludes that interest on compensation starting from the date that Ms. Young filed her Complaint with the Commission is warranted pursuant to subsection 53(4) of the CHRA.\n[357] As set out in subsection 53(4) of the CHRA and rule 9(12) of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure (03-05-04), the Complainant is entitled to interest on the compensation ordered, which accrues from the date that Ms. Young filed her Complaint with the Commission.\n[358] However, in no case shall the accrual of interest on the awards made under subsection 53(2)(e) and 52(3) result in a total award that exceeds the statutory maximums these provisions allow (Chopra, at para 53; citing Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53 (CanLII), at page 437.\n[359] Interest will be simple interest calculated on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada.\n6. Policy Remedies (s. 53(2)(a) of the CHRA)\n[360] Having found that VIA failed to discharge its obligation to promptly address and respond to allegations of discrimination and failed to conduct a prompt, thorough and fair investigation of the allegations raised by Ms. Young, in addition to being mindful of the Tribunal\u2019s statutory mandate to prevent discriminatory conduct from reoccurring, I find that this case is one which invokes the authority to make remedial policy orders pursuant to s. 53(2)(a) of the Act, which states:\n(2) If at the conclusion of the inquiry the member or panel finds that the complaint is substantiated, the member or panel may, subject to section 54, make an order against the person found to be engaging or to have engaged in the discriminatory practice and include in the order any of the following terms that the member or panel considers appropriate:\n(a) that the person cease the discriminatory practice and take measures, in consultation with the Commission on the general purposes of the measures, to redress the practice or to prevent the same or a similar practice from occurring in future, including\n(i) the adoption of a special program, plan or arrangement referred to in subsection 16(1), or\n(ii) making an application for approval and implementing a plan under section 17;\n[361] The Commission\u2019s request for policy remedies in this case are outlined in its Statement of Particulars. The policy remedies sought include:\nAn Order requiring VIA to work with the Commission to review and revise its harassment policy;\nAn Order requiring VIA, in consultation with the Commission, to retain independent and appropriate persons to conduct workplace training on harassment and discrimination for employees including managers, supervisors and employees responsible in (sic) conducting harassment investigations in the workplace;\nAn Order requiring VIA to make all new employees aware of the existence of the harassment policy and to provide the necessary training; and\nAn Order requiring that VIA complete the implementation of all the policy remedies sought within six months of the date of the Tribunals decision in this matter.\n[362] Having considered the totality of the evidence, the seriousness of the conduct and especially the safety-sensitive nature of the work performed by locomotive attendants, I find it appropriate to make policy remedies to address the awareness of issues related to harassment and human rights within this workplace, the development of appropriate investigation procedures and training, and an accountability mechanism whereby VIA can learn about whether its policies, training and procedures are having the necessary and desired effect of preventing discrimination and harassment on the basis of a protected characteristic. These orders are detailed below at paragraph 369 of these reasons.\n[363] The Commission has also asked that the Tribunal retain jurisdiction over this matter for a period of nine months from the date of my decision.\n[364] The Tribunal has the authority to retain jurisdiction over a matter (see First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada), 2020 CHRT 7, at paras 51 and following).\n[365] It is not the ordinary practice of the Tribunal to make an order authorizing itself to retain jurisdiction following the issuance of its final decision on the merits. Although it has the jurisdiction to do so, and it may indeed be appropriate to do so in some cases, the Tribunal does not have sufficient resources, nor is it structured in a way that would permit it to supervise the implementation of its orders in most cases. And in the ordinary course, it is important for the parties to have finality and to be able to move forward from the litigation process.\n[366] Having said that, in the circumstances of this decision, I am electing to exercise my discretion to retain jurisdiction over the policy remedies that I have ordered for two reasons:\nVIA did not make meaningful submissions at the hearing or in its closing submissions about any steps taken since the hearing to address the issues raised in the Complaint, or to make the Tribunal aware of any actions taken which might render the Orders made in these reasons redundant or counterproductive.\nIn light of the length of time since the hearing, I want to permit the parties to address any issues that have arisen since the hearing that might be germane to the remedies ordered.\n[367] To avoid any unanticipated negative consequences from the Respondent, I will retain jurisdiction for a period of six months, with respect to the policy remedies ordered.\nV. Decision [368] For all these reasons, I award Ms. Young:\nan amount of $12,000 under subsection 53(2)(e) of the Act in respect of pain and suffering experienced as a result of Mr. Sawchuk\u2019s discriminatory conduct; an amount of $3000 under subsection 53(3) of the Act in respect of VIA\u2019s reckless conduct; an amount of $6359.85 pursuant to subsection 53(2)(c) of the Act in respect of lost overtime wages; interest on these amounts, calculated at a simple rate on a yearly basis at the Bank Rate (monthly series) established by the Bank of Canada, calculated as of the date that the Complaint was filed with the Commission, November 15, 2013, up to the date of payment of compensation, provided that such amounts do not exceed the maximum amounts allowed by the Act, that is $20,000 for each of the items 1 and 2 above. The Tribunal further orders that VIA cease the discriminatory practices and take measures to prevent such practices from happening again in the future. Specifically, I order the Respondent\nwithin 6 months of the date of this decision:\nto develop human rights and anti-harassment policies and procedures, in consultation with the Commission. Attention will be given in the development of these policies to identifying discrimination and implicit bias within the workplace as well as the impact of discrimination and bias within safety-sensitive workplaces;\nafter the creation of these human rights and anti-harassment policies to hire an external expert to train its employees, including all supervisors, on these new policies and procedures; and\nwithin three years of the date of the revised human rights and anti-harassment policies and procedures:\nto engage an external expert to conduct an audit of the human rights and anti-harassment policies and procedures as well as the level of training, comprehension and adherence to the policies by employees, with the results to be reviewed promptly by the Commission.\nFinally, I order that the Tribunal remain seized of the policy remedies ordered in these reasons, for six months from the date that the orders are made.\nVI. Conclusion [369] Finally, I am grateful to the parties and to their counsel for the collegial and professional way in which this long hearing was conducted and for the patience of the parties with respect to the issuance of these reasons.\nSigned by\nKirsten Mercer\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 27, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2225\/4717\nStyle of Cause:\nJennifer Young v.

OVERVIEW [1] The Complainants are a group of retired pilots who allege that Air Canada and the Air Canada Pilots Association (the \u201cRespondents\u201d) discriminated against them by requiring them to retire at the age of 60 because of a mandatory retirement rule in their collective agreement. Most of the Complainants are represented by counsel (the \u201cCoalition Complainants\u201d). Eric Rogers, Robert McBride, John Pinheiro, Patricia Clark (on behalf of the estate of William Clark) and Stephen Collier are representing themselves.\n[2] The Respondents rely on what was then s.15(1)(c) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the Act) which allowed employers to terminate employment based on age if it was the \u201cnormal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the position of that individual\u201d. Alternatively, the Respondents argue that requiring pilots to retire at age 60 is a bona fide occupational requirement and that they could not accommodate the pilots without suffering undue hardship.\n[3] To decide if the Respondents can rely on s.15(1)(c) as a defence to what would otherwise be age discrimination, I have to determine which comparator airlines employed pilots in positions similar to those held by the Complainants during the relevant period. I decided to apply the factors from previous proceedings that challenged the same mandatory retirement rule for Air Canada pilots to determine the list of comparator airlines (Nedelec et al v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, 2022 CHRT 30 (the \u201cFactors Ruling\u201d)).\n[4] Specifically, I found that to be included in the comparator group for the relevant period of January 1, 2010, to February 28, 2012 (when the last of the Nedelec pilots turned 60), airlines would have to meet all of the following requirements that were set out in the case of Vilven v. Air Canada, 2009 FC 367 (\u201cthe Vilven FC factors\u201d):\nThey operate aircraft of varying sizes;\nThey operate aircraft of varying types;\nThey fly to domestic destination(s);\nThey fly to international destinations;\nThey cross domestic and foreign airspace; and\nThey transport passengers\n(Factors Ruling at para 40).\n[5] The Respondents submit that the complaints should be dismissed because Air Canada employed more pilots during all the periods in question than all the comparator airlines. In other words, Air Canada\u2019s pilots are the dominant group and therefore define the normal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the positions of the Complainants.\n[6] The Coalition Complainants do not disagree with the Respondents. They agree that the outcome of the complaints is inevitable in light of the Tribunal\u2019s Factors Ruling and the data the airlines provided about the number of pilots they employed. The other Complainants did not file anything in response to the Respondents\u2019 request to dismiss the complaints.\n[7] The Canadian Human Rights Commission has not participated in these proceedings since I took carriage of these files in 2021 other than to observe case management conference calls (CMCCs).\nII. ISSUES [8] There are two remaining questions to determine the normal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the position of the Complainants and to decide whether the Respondents can rely on s.15(1)(c):\n(i)Which airlines meet the remaining Vilven FC factors and should be included in the comparator group?\n(ii)Did Air Canada employ the majority of pilots during the relevant periods?\nIII. DECISION [9] The normal age of retirement for employees working in positions similar to the position of the Complainants is 60, the age at which they retired. Air Canada employed more pilots than the total of all the pilots employed by the comparator airlines during the relevant periods. The Respondents can rely on s.15(1)(c) as a defence, and the complaints are dismissed. The Complainants did not establish that the Respondents\u2019 mandatory retirement rule is a discriminatory practice.\nIV. PRELIMINARY ISSUE [10] Robert McBride, one of the Complainants, wrote to the Tribunal on June 2, 2023, to advise it that the Air Canada Pilots Association had ceased to exist and that Air Canada pilots are now represented by a different pilots\u2019 association. He raised a number of concerns about this change, including the fact that there have been other changes in counsel, representatives and the presiding member over the course of these lengthy proceedings. He also asked whether the Commission and Tribunal had been made aware of this change.\n[11] Counsel for the Air Canada Pilots Association responded and advised that the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) and the Air Canada Pilots Association finalized a merger agreement as of May 17, 2023. According to the terms of that agreement, the ALPA became the successor union to the Air Canada Pilots Association and may be confirmed as a respondent in these proceedings. The Tribunal will amend the style of cause accordingly.\n[12] The Tribunal confirms that it learned of this change when Mr. McBride and counsel for the ALPA contacted the Tribunal. There were no ex parte communications with the Respondent, the ALPA or any other party to these proceedings. In other words, the Tribunal did not communicate with any party without the other parties\u2019 involvement or without them knowing about it.\nV. BACKGROUND \u2013 PREVIOUS RULINGS AND METHODOLOGY [13] I have briefly summarized the steps taken in this file to explain why I am dismissing the complaints.\n[14] In the Factors Ruling, I set out a phased approach for identifying airlines in the comparator group, starting with an analysis of the first two Vilven FC factors, namely whether airlines operate aircraft of varying size and whether they operate aircraft of varying types.\n[15] After receiving the parties\u2019 submissions, I determined that 21 airlines operated aircraft of varying sizes and varying types and would advance to the next stage of analysis as possible comparator airlines (Nedelec et al. v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, 2022 CHRT 40 at para 25 [the \u201cSize\/Type Ruling\u201d]).\n[16] I then worked with the parties in case management to address how to fairly and efficiently determine which airlines met the remaining factors, namely flying to both domestic and international destinations, crossing domestic and foreign airspace, and transporting passengers.\n[17] The parties agreed that a questionnaire would be sent to the airlines together with summonses to appear at the hearing. Air Canada prepared the questionnaire, and all parties had the chance to review and comment. They agreed on the wording of the questions which asked airlines how many pilots they employed during the relevant periods and whether they operated international flights, including points in the United States, and\/or whether they were willing to provide quotes and arrange for an international charter on request to or from any international location, including the United States. The Tribunal issued the summonses and Air Canada served them on all the comparator airlines.\n[18] Recipients of the summonses were also told that if they responded to the questions and provided the requisite material to support their answers, their personal attendance at the hearing may not be required. All parties agreed that this was the most efficient and expeditious way of gathering the remaining data needed to determine which airlines are comparators. The Tribunal scheduled hearing days to give the parties the opportunity to challenge the responses received and ask questions of the airlines\u2019 representatives, if required.\n[19] Nineteen airlines provided a complete response to the questionnaire. One airline provided a partial response, and one did not respond. Air Canada collated the data received in response to the questionnaire and shared it in the form of a summary table in advance of the next CMCC. The parties had the opportunity to review the data in advance of our next CMCC.\n[20] During the CMCC I asked the Complainants for their positions on the data received. The Coalition Complainants said that they were not in a position to disagree with any of the responses received. They also acknowledged that it was inevitable that the complaints would be dismissed given the methodology adopted by the Tribunal in its Factors Ruling and the number of pilots the airlines employed in the comparator group versus all those Air Canada employed. The other Complainants agreed and did not take issue with Air Canada\u2019s summary of the responses or its presentation of the data. They also agreed with the Coalition Complainants\u2019 assessment of the outcome of the complaints. The hearing dates were cancelled on consent of all parties, and Air Canada told the witnesses that their presence was no longer required.\nA. The Coalition Complainants\u2019 request to stay the proceedings [21] During the same CMCC, the Coalition Complainants asked me to stay the proceedings until the conclusion of the Federal Court\u2019s determination of its application for judicial review of the Tribunal\u2019s Factors Ruling, which I denied. I did not find that the interests of justice supported delaying the proceedings for an indeterminate amount of time. I also did not find it in the public interest to hold the complaints in abeyance while awaiting judicial determination of an interim ruling.\n[22] Given the Complainants\u2019 statements about the inevitable outcome of these proceedings, I also set deadlines for the Respondents to provide brief submissions explaining why they believe on the basis of the data received that the complaints have no prospect of success and must fail. I gave the Complainants the opportunity to respond and set deadlines for reply submissions, as required.\n[23] The Coalition Complainants agreed with the Respondents that the complaints must be dismissed if the methodology adopted by the Tribunal in the Factors Ruling is applied to the data provided by the airlines in response to the questionnaire. Yet the Coalition Complainants reiterated their request to adjourn a final decision in this matter until the conclusion of the judicial review of the Factors Ruling, arguing that if that ruling is overturned, the Complainants would then have to seek judicial review of an eventual final decision in these complaints. In submissions dated May 24, 2023, they say that the judicial review is only \u201cweeks away\u201d from being heard by the Federal Court.\n[24] I am not persuaded that I should revisit my decision denying the request to stay the proceedings. The Coalition Complainants had the option to wait until the conclusion of these proceedings to file a judicial review, particularly as the list of comparator airlines was not yet established when I issued the Factors Ruling, and no data had yet been received from the airlines about their total headcount of pilots. Their decision to proceed with a review of an interim ruling is not a basis to stay these proceedings until the conclusion of a judicial review and appeals. While the hearing of their application for judicial review may be scheduled for July 2023, a decision or possible appeal could take far longer.\nB. Proceeding in an abbreviated way is fair and efficient [25] I am making a final decision in these long-standing complaints through an abbreviated process and without an oral hearing. I have accepted summaries of uncontested evidence from counsel using the Tribunal\u2019s powers under s. 50(3)(c) of the Act, and worked with the parties in case management to move forward in an expeditious and efficient way. I secured the parties\u2019 consent to proceed on this basis, after having given them the opportunity to challenge the evidence and question witnesses. This approach has saved the parties and the Tribunal the time and expense of formally calling witnesses or introducing affidavit evidence.\n[26] My decision to proceed this way reflects the parties\u2019 acknowledgement that there was no benefit to continuing with a full hearing given what was known of the evidence at the time and the Tribunal\u2019s previous rulings. The parties had already spent considerable time arguing over what methodology I should apply in these cases, as reflected in the Factors Ruling and the Size\/Type Ruling. The Coalition Complainants also applied to judicially review the Factors Ruling. This highlights the fact that the methodology the Tribunal decided to adopt in these complaints was the issue the parties viewed as most contentious and significant to determine in these proceedings. In my view, proceeding in an expedited, abbreviated way to render a final decision in these complaints is proportionate to the remaining issues in these complaints and favours the Tribunal\u2019s statutory obligation to conduct its proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow (s.48.9(1) of the Act).\nVI. REASONS (i) Which airlines meet the remaining Vilven FC factors and should be included in the comparator group? [27] I prepared to rely on the uncontested data on the application of the remaining Vilven FC factors presented by Air Canada even though it was not presented in the usual manner. No party indicated an intention to challenge it or questioned its accuracy.\n[28] Of the 19 airlines that responded to the questionnaire, the following airlines meet all the remaining factors and form the comparator group for the purposes of determining the normal age of retirement during the relevant periods:\nAir North\nAir Tindi\nCalm Air\nCanadian North\nEnerjet\nFirst Air\nJazz\nMorningstar Air Express\nNolinor\nNorth Cariboo\nProvincial Airlines\nVoyageur Airways\nWasaya\n[29] According to Air Canada, six of the airlines should not be included as comparators because they do not meet one or more of the remaining criteria. The other parties do not dispute these submissions, and I accept them on the face of the data received, which speaks for itself.\n[30] Flair Airlines advised that it did not operate aircraft of varying sizes and types during the relevant period as it only operated three Boeing 737-400s. Although other aircraft appeared in the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register, Flair Airlines explained that these were solely for private use and were not operated as part of its commercial business.\n[31] Air Creebec, Air Inuit, Buffalo Airways, Central Mountain Air and Kelowna Flightcraft should not be included in the comparator group either. They did not transport passengers to both domestic and international destinations and through Canadian and foreign airspace during the relevant periods. More specifically, they did not operate international flights and were not willing to provide quotes and arrange for an international charter on request to or from any international location including the United States during these same periods.\n(ii) Did Air Canada employ the majority of pilots during the relevant periods? [32] In the Factors Ruling, I held that, once the Tribunal confirmed the comparator group and the number of pilots employed by the airlines, it may not be necessary to proceed any further. In other words, if Air Canada employed more pilots than all of the comparator airlines, the Tribunal may dismiss the complaints.\n[33] I am applying the statistical analysis from Vilven FC (applied in Thwaites et al. v. Air Canada and Air Canada Pilots Association, 2011 CHRT 11) [Thwaites], upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in Adamson v. Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission), 2015 FCA 153.\n[34] I have considered the entire period during which the Complainants retired. Air Canada divided the total period of January 1, 2020, to February 28, 2012, into five sub-periods that have start and end dates corresponding to changes in the evidence the comparator airlines provided. In an appendix to its submissions, Air Canada also provided the upper and lower limits of pilots the comparator airlines employed and similarly set out the number of pilots Air Canada employed during the relevant periods.\n[35] I am prepared to accept this uncontested data, summarized by Air Canada and set out below. No party challenged it or questioned its accuracy, and all waived their right to examine or cross-examine the witnesses summonsed from airlines. The summary below sets out the number of pilots employed by Air Canada versus the pilot count of the comparator airlines. It also shows the proportion of the total number of pilots the headcounts represent. In the case of the comparator airlines, a range is shown because it corresponds to the lowest and highest number of pilots employed during that period.\nJanuary 1 \u2013 June 30, 2010:\nAir Canada: 3083 pilots\nComparator airlines: 2116.3 to 2121.3 pilots\nTotal pilots: 5199.3 to 5206.3\nAir Canada employed 59.22% - 59.3% of the total.\nJuly 1 \u2013 December 31, 2010:\nAir Canada: 3028 pilots\nComparator airlines: 2188.3 to 2198.3 pilots\nTotal pilots: 5216.3 to 5226.3\nAir Canada employed 57.94 - 58.05% of the total.\nJanuary 1 \u2013 June 30, 2011:\nAir Canada: 3011 pilots\nComparator airlines: 2269.2 to 2295.2 pilots\nTotal pilots: 5280.2 to 5306.2\nAir Canada employed 56.74 - 57.02% of the total.\nJuly 1- December 31, 2011:\nAir Canada: 3024 pilots\nComparator airlines: 2475.2 to 2479.2 pilots\nTotal pilots: 5499.2 to 5503.2\nAir Canada employed 54.99 - 54.95% of the total.\nJanuary 1 \u2013 February 28, 2012:\nAir Canada: 3021 pilots\nComparator airlines: 2447 pilots\nTotal pilots: 5468\nAir Canada employed 55.25% of the total.\n[36] ALPA stated that based on Air Canada\u2019s chart, the aggregate headcount numbers for the listed airlines range from 2349 at the low end to 2726, even when including those airlines which self-reported as not meeting the Vilven FC factors and rounding up all headcount numbers at the high ends of their ranges. Air Canada\u2019s pilot headcount numbers range from 3011 to 3083 for the given periods, figures provided by Air Canada\u2019s counsel at the CMCC, which were uncontested and accepted at face value. In other words, even without filtering out comparator airlines that self-reported as not meeting the Vilven FC factors and taking all comparator airlines headcounts at their highest, Air Canada still employed more pilots than the comparators during each period.\n[37] The Complainants also agreed at the last CMCC that the two airlines who either did not respond fully or not at all (Kelowna Flightcraft and Regional 1) would not have employed enough pilots to make a difference or tip the balance of the comparator airlines over Air Canada in terms of the number of pilots employed.\n[38] The normal age of retirement is the age of retirement of the majority of pilots in the overall representative group of employees occupying similar positions (Nedelec v. Rogers, 2021 FC 191 at paras 33-35). As ALPA submits, the age of retirement is therefore still defined by Air Canada\u2019s pilots as the dominant group.\n[39] I am therefore persuaded that, for the periods set out above, the normal age of retirement was 60. Air Canada\u2019s pilots represent the majority of the total pilots employed. I accept Air Canada\u2019s submissions that this conclusion holds even if I assume, without deciding, that the normal age of retirement of pilots at all the comparator airlines was an age other than 60. In other words, because Air Canada employed the majority of the pilots in the relevant periods, regardless of the actual age at which pilots retired at the comparator airlines, the normal age of retirement was 60 for that period because that was Air Canada\u2019s mandatory retirement age. This is the same reasoning or approach that the Tribunal followed in Thwaites at paras 181-82.\n[40] The Respondents are therefore able to rely on s.15(1)(c) of the Act, as it then was. Their requirement that pilots retire at age 60 was permissible because the normal age of retirement was 60. The Respondents\u2019 mandatory retirement rule does not constitute a discriminatory practice under the Act.\nVII. ORDER [41] The style of cause is amended in accordance with paragraph [11] above.\n[42] The complaints are dismissed.\nSigned by\nJennifer Khurana\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJune 27, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal Files:\nT1536\/8210 to T1599\/14510; T1630\/17610 to T1645\/19110; T1664\/01911 toT1681\/03611; T1709\/6213; T1710\/6214; T1713\/6217 to T1718\/6222; T1721\/6255;T1722\/7711; T1755\/11011 to T1768\/12311; T1780\/1012 &T1781\/1112; T1793\/2312 & T1794\/2412; T1801\/3112 to T1806\/3612; T1858\/8812 to T1861\/9112\nStyle of Cause: Nedelec et al v.

He applied to sponsor his parents to come to Canada in 2009. At that time, the Canadian Government was taking much longer to process immigration applications for \u201cparents and grandparents\u201d as opposed to other family sponsorship categories such as spouses and children. Dr. Attaran claimed that this was discrimination based on age, family status, race, and national or ethnic origin.\nAlthough Dr. Attaran's parents were eventually approved for sponsorship and the process for parents and grandparents has changed since 2009, his complaint remained unresolved. The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) first confirmed that Dr. Attaran's parents possessed characteristics protected under the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA), including race, national or ethnic origin, family status, and age. Next, the Tribunal looked at whether specific government actions that contributed to the longer processing times for the parent and grandparent category are a \u201cservice\u201d under the CHRA.\nDr. Attaran challenged the way Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada implemented the \u201cLevels Plans\u201d. The \u201cLevels Plans\u201d are projections for how many people will be welcomed to Canada each year, broken down by category of immigrant.\nDr. Attaran also challenged the Ministerial Instructions. The Tribunal found that the Ministerial Instructions could not be considered a service under the CHRA.\nThe remaining allegation concerned the failure of the Minister to exercise his power to exempt parent and grandparent sponsors and applicants from any immigration regulations, which could be considered discriminatory on a prohibited ground under the CHRA. The Tribunal found that this allegation was basically an attack on offending regulations. Dr. Attaran and the Canadian Human Rights Commission did not establish that regulation-making is a service and specifically suggested that the Tribunal not determine that question.\nThe complaint was dismissed because Dr. Attaran failed to prove the essential elements of the case. While he showed different treatment and the ways in which applications for parents and grandparents were processed more slowly than other categories, he did not show that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada engaged in a discriminatory practice. For each allegation discussed above, either there was no adverse differential treatment established, or the adverse differential treatment alleged was explained by something that was not proven to be a \u201cservice\u201d under section 5 of the CHRA.\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation: 2023 CHRT\n27\nDate:\nJuly 4, 2023\nFile No.:\nT2163\/3716\nBetween:\nAmir Attaran\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nImmigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (formerly Citizenship and Immigration Canada)\nRespondent\n- and -\nChinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic\nInterested party\nDecision\nMember:\nDavid L.

THE INQUIRY [1] This is the final decision on an inquiry before the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d or \u201cCHRT\u201d) for a complaint that was filed more than a decade ago. The matter was before the Tribunal for over 6 years, with a hearing of 22 days and extensive written submissions that took place over a 13-month period in 2021 and 2022.\n[2] This inquiry concerned the complaint of Dr. Amir Attaran (the \u201cComplainant\u201d) against Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\u201cIRCC\u201d and formerly known as Citizenship and Immigration Canada or \u201cCIC\u201d) filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d) on July 28, 2010. The Complainant alleges that discriminatory practices by the Respondent contributed to the significant delay in the processing of his application to sponsor his parents for immigration, as well as delays for other similar applicants, compared to other immigration categories under the Family Class (as defined in the Regulations to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27) (\u201cIRPA\u201d), contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cCHRA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[3] The original prohibited grounds of discrimination alleged were the age and family status. Upon a written motion, I also permitted Dr. Attaran to amend his complaint to add the prohibited grounds of race, and national or ethnic origin (see 2017 CHRT 21).\n[4] Initially the Commission declined to refer Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal for an inquiry. The Commission dismissed his complaint on the basis that, although it appeared IRCC processed applications for parents and grandparents differently from sponsorship applications for spouses and dependent children, they were satisfied that it was the result of the exercise of ministerial discretion and that the complainant had not directly challenged the Minister\u2019s authority to exercise such discretion.\n[5] Dr. Attaran made an application for a judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision. The Federal Court dismissed Dr. Attaran\u2019s application for judicial review. Dr. Attaran appealed the decision to the Federal Court of Appeal which, in their decision dated February 3, 2015, overturned the Federal Court\u2019s finding and referred the matter back to the Commission (2015 FCA 37).\n[6] The Commission eventually referred Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint to the Tribunal, where it was received on September 7, 2016. Case management before the Tribunal went on for a long time. There were numerous issues raised about the disclosure of documents. Many thousands of documents were eventually released by IRCC to Dr. Attaran through the disclosure process. Over the course of the pre-hearing period, 15 case management conference calls (CMCCs) were held and I wrote four rulings in response to written interlocutory motions.\n[7] In August of 2017, the Chinese and South Asian Law Clinic (\u201cCSALC\u201d) in Toronto brought a motion to be added as an interested party to this complaint. CSALC is a not-for-profit organization incorporated under the laws of Ontario. It provides free legal services to and acts as an advocacy group for non-English speaking, low-income members of the Chinese, Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian communities living in Ontario. CSALC is also involved in law reform and has appeared before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration to make submissions on various topics, including family reunification and family class sponsorship applications. CSALC also engages in test case litigation from time to time. I concluded that CSALC possessed expertise that might assist the Tribunal in this matter. Their acceptance as an interested party was limited in accordance with wishes stated by the Complainant (see 2018 CHRT 6.)\n[8] Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the start of the hearing, which had originally been scheduled to start in-person in Ottawa in April 2020. Eventually, the hearing began on-line in February 2021, using the Zoom teleconference platform. There were two unplanned interruptions to the hearing (discussed below) resulting in hearing days re-scheduled to April and September 2021. Final oral arguments were scheduled to be heard in early 2022. However, the Complainant requested the cancellation of the oral hearing for personal reasons, and I approved that request after consultation with the other parties. In total, there were 22 hearing days in addition to written final arguments and then further written submissions in lieu of oral final arguments.\nII. DISPOSITION [9] For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the Complainant and the Commission have not substantiated this complaint. They have failed to establish a prima facie case demonstrating adverse differential treatment in the provision of a service by the Respondent.\nIII. THE PARTIES [10] The Complainant, Dr. Amir Attaran, testified that he was born and raised in California, as the only child to parents who immigrated there from Iran. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in neuroscience from University of California at Berkeley, and a master of science degree in biology from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. Dr. Attaran went on to complete his PhD in a biology-related discipline at the University of Oxford in England. Dr. Attaran then completed a bachelor of laws degree at the University of British Columbia. Before becoming a professor at the University of Ottawa, in both the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Attaran held academic positions at Harvard University and Yale University.\n[11] Counsel for the Commission changed over the course of the long case management period. Long-time CHRC counsel, Maitre Daniel Poulin, reached his retirement before the matter went to hearing. He was replaced by Ms. Caroline Carrasco who was based abroad, for the early portions of the hearing. At the same time, the Complainant was in California with his parents, creating a ten-hour time zone difference between all the parties. Notwithstanding the great distance, the on-line platform allowed us to finish many hearing days and the Tribunal thanks Ms. Carrasco for keeping such late hours during that phase. The Commission was also ably represented throughout the preliminary and evidence portions of the inquiry by Ms. Sasha Hart.\n[12] Counsel for the Respondent also changed over the course of the pre-hearing stage. Korinda McLaine and Abigail Martinez from the Department of Justice originally represented the Respondent. During the pre-hearing case management, they were eventually replaced by their colleagues, Sean Stynes and Kelly Keenan, who were also supported by co-counsel Susanne Wladysiuk and paralegal, Courtney Hughes.\n[13] The interested party, the Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, was represented by Jin Chien and Ada Chan.\nIV. THE COMPLAINT [14] According to his original complaint form, Dr. Attaran filed the first part of his application (the \u201cPart 1\u201d application) to sponsor his parents for immigration in July of 2009. When he filed his complaint with the CHRC, he noted that the Respondent\u2019s website indicated that IRCC was completing the processing of Part 1 applications to sponsor parents and grandparents (\u201cPGPs\u201d) approximately 37 months after their receipt. By contrast, the same website indicated IRCC was completing the processing of Part 1 sponsorship applications for spouses, common-law or conjugal partners, dependant children and certain other relatives (referred to as \u201cFC1s\u201d) in approximately 42 days (see Exhibit 1). Dr. Attaran alleged that the longer processing time constituted adverse differential treatment on prohibited grounds under the CHRA.\n[15] IRCC ultimately approved Dr. Attaran\u2019s application and his parents landed in Canada as permanent residents approximately a decade ago. However, Dr. Attaran\u2019s final arguments allege multiple discriminatory practices involving systemic discrimination on behalf of all sponsors and their parents or grandparents in the Family Class who are \u201cin a similar situation\u201d to the one he was in when sponsoring his parents (Complainant\u2019s Factum at paras. 3 and 5). As such, he seeks systemic as well as personal remedies for the discrimination he alleges.\n[16] It should be noted that since filing his complaint, the regime for sponsorship of parents and grandparents has undergone considerable change, and some of the changes were addressed by parties during this inquiry. As a result, some allegations involve policies that are no longer in effect, and in some cases Dr. Attaran has addressed IRCC actions and adverse effects that did not apply to his own sponsorship application (Part 1 of the sponsorship application process) and his parents\u2019 permanent residency applications (Part 2 of the application process). The other allegations will be addressed in these reasons, but the primary emphasis of the complaint was the long, disproportionate delay endured by the Attaran family and others who wished to sponsor a parent or grandparent to immigrate to Canada at that time.\n[17] The length of time IRCC took from receipt to final approval of Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents\u2019 permanent residency application, and the fact that this time was longer than for applications in the other main Family Class category (FC1s) in the same time period, is not in dispute.\n[18] Instead, the cornerstone of the Respondent\u2019s position is that the factors which contributed to the longer processing times did not derive from services provided by IRCC or the responsible Minister. In 2019 the Respondent was granted an amendment to the Respondent\u2019s Statement of Particulars to put in issue whether the alleged discriminatory practices occurred in the provision of a \u201cservice\u201d (2019 CHRT 12). The Respondent accepts that in a general sense, processing applications is a service carried out by the Respondent. However, the Respondent insists that every aspect of the processing practices that are alleged to be discriminatory by the Complainant and Commission stemmed from a government action that was not a service under section 5 of the CHRA, and therefore, the complaint should be dismissed at the prima facie stage.\n[19] In their final arguments, the Complainant and Commission emphasized that they do not take aim at the government actions of legislating IRPA, passing regulations, or the Cabinet\u2019s approval of the target ranges for how many people may be admitted as permanent residents each year. Instead, the Complainant and Commission have specifically asked the Tribunal to evaluate whether IRCC engaged in a discriminatory practice when it processed the Complainant\u2019s application to sponsor his parents and his parents\u2019 associated application for permanent resident status. Among the acts that the Complainant and Commission allege were discriminatory practices during the processing of applications included discretionary decisions made by the Respondent, discretionary decisions made by the Minister when granting exemptions under s. 25.2(1) of IRPA, and the Minister\u2019s issuance of Ministerial Instructions pursuant to s. 87.3. of IRPA.\nV. STATUTORY CONTEXT [20] To properly put the complaint into context, it is necessary to describe the statutory, regulatory and policy regimes that affect Family Class applications like Dr. Attaran\u2019s. Under IRPA, there are three main categories for immigration: Family Class; Economic Immigrants; and Refugees. Within each major group, there are sub-groups of immigrants for which there are different rules and requirements for admission to Canada.\n[21] Under the Immigration and Refugee Protections Regulations (SOR\/2002-227) (the \u201cIRPA Regulations\u201d), there is a definition under s. 117 of foreign nationals who potentially make up the Family Class eligible for sponsorship for immigration to Canada. Their eligibility is dependent on their relationship with their relative, who must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident and otherwise eligible to sponsor them. While there are several different types of potential family class members, only two categories comprise the vast majority of applications received each year: a) FC1s (mainly spouses, partners and dependent children); and, b) PGPs (parents and grandparents) and also referred to sometimes as FC4s.\n[22] Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint set out the two-step process for sponsoring a member of the Family Class. First, the prospective sponsor in Canada must complete the Part 1 sponsorship application about themselves which assists the Respondent in determining the applicant\u2019s eligibility to be a sponsor. A number of factors are considered, including the applicant\u2019s income level and ability to support the sponsored immigrant family member(s). The second part of the process is the sponsored relatives\u2019 application (Part 2) which sets out information about them. The application process also includes background checks and results of a medical examination to ensure compliance with the statutory requirements applicable to all immigrants to Canada. In these reasons, both Part 1 and Part 2 together form the Attaran family\u2019s \u201capplication\u201d, while Part 1 may also be referred to as the application to sponsor and Part 2 may be referred to as the application for permanent resident status.\n[23] Section 94 of IRPA, requires the responsible Minister to table in Parliament an annual report on the operation of IRPA in the preceding calendar year. Under s. 94(2)(b) of IRPA, this annual report must also include a description of the number of foreign nationals who became permanent residents, and the number projected to become permanent residents in Canada in the following year. The parties described the annual plan for projected new immigrants as the \u201cLevels Plan\u201d. While s. 94(1) states it is the responsibility of the Minister to present the annual report to Parliament, the way the Levels Plan is developed is not prescribed by the statutory regime. The character and significance of the Levels Plans is explored further below.\n[24] In a general sense, IRPA is a statute that provides the framework for the immigration regime. It gives only an outline of the main structure of the program. It addresses matters like the broader objectives of the immigration program, general requirements for immigration (such as clear background and medical checks), details about the Immigration and Refugee Board and enforcement.\n[25] The actual details about who gets into Canada, and who does not, is subordinated to the IRPA Regulations. The regulations set out the detailed requirements for each sub-category of immigration. The points assessment regime for the economic classes is outlined in detail. The requirements for the family classes and refugee classes are also set out in the IRPA Regulations.\n[26] In addition to IRPA, the IRPA Regulations and the Levels Plans, the processing of immigration applications is also affected by Ministerial Instructions. In 2008, IRPA was amended by the addition of s. 87.3 which authorizes the Minister to create Ministerial Instructions in furtherance of the Government\u2019s immigration goals. Ministerial Instructions and Section 87 are discussed in detail later in these reasons.\n[27] Another type of action taken by the Minister that is in issue in this case is the issuing of exemptions from any applicable criteria or obligations under IRPA for a foreign national who is inadmissible or does not meet the normal requirements for immigration. The Minister has authority to issue exemptions for public policy considerations under section 25.2(1) of IRPA.\n[28] In addition to the foregoing, the processing of immigration applications is also impacted by IRCC policy decisions. These are generally administrative decisions by IRCC directing its officers to implement processing in a particular manner.\nVI. HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE COMPLAINT [29] When looking at the longer processing times for PGPs at the time of Dr. Attaran\u2019s application, it is helpful to examine that time period in broader context. From an historical point of view, up until the late 1980s, Canadian immigration policy alternated between periods of large inflows targeted at specific economic goals and periods of virtual shut down of immigration in the face of poor domestic labour market conditions. Whereas the level of inflow was only 83,402 in 1985, by 1993 it was increased to nearly 250,000 and inflow levels have remained high ever since, currently at levels of approximately 400,000 \u2013 500,000 new immigrants per year. The notion of curtailing immigration in periods of high domestic unemployment was abandoned in the 1990s in favour of perceived long-term goals of a sustained high-level of new immigrants. (See \u201cThe Economic Goals of Canada\u2019s Immigration Policy: Past and Present\u201d by Alan G. Green (Queen\u2019s University) and David A. Green (University of British Columbia) submitted with the Complainant\u2019s final written argument, which I will refer to as the Complainant\u2019s \u201cFactum.\u201d)\n[30] This historical change, the decision to keep immigration at high levels constantly, which began in the early 1990s, had a significant impact on this complaint and the processing of all PGP sponsorship applications. In order to be a sponsor for immigration of one\u2019s parents or grandparents, one must first be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. Secondly, one\u2019s parents or grandparents must not already be in Canada as permanent residents or citizens. As such, the pool of potential sponsors is mostly comprised of new immigrants to Canada. As that pool grew considerably in size in the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000s, so did the demand for sponsorship of PGPs.\n[31] During the hearing, Dr. Attaran put a document to Mr. Glen Tetford, the Respondent\u2019s witness responsible for Part 1 sponsorship application processing at the IRCC Case Processing Centre in Mississauga, Ontario (\u201cCPC-Mississauga\u201d or \u201cCPC-M\u201d). Mr. Tetford confirmed this document\u2019s apparent veracity, and it was admitted as Exhibit 84. It was identified as an IRCC document called a \u201cPGP Diagnostique\u201d from 2017, which outlined the following history of IRCC\u2019s intake of PGP sponsorship applications:\nUntil the early 2000's the department was able to keep pace with application intake, processing PGP applications with minimal delay. There were no numeric limits on application intake and processing largely kept pace with intake although in some cases PGP applications for permanent residence were processed over slightly longer time frames than those for Spouses and Partners.\nHowever, by 2001 it was becoming apparent that PGP application intake was beginning to outpace the department's ability to process those applications, resulting in inventory backlogs and lengthening wait times\u2026\nThe increased demand on the overall program and the department's response in the form of deliberate and strategic management of levels resulted in limits on the number of PGP cases to be processed annually. For the first time, in 2002, there was a backlog of PGP cases, and over a matter of months a marked increase in PGP processing times became the reality. By 2003 intake of sponsorship applications for PGPs reached 50,000 while the levels plan and attendant landings hovered around 20,000. As a result of ongoing application intake well in excess of levels targets, inventories continued to grow until 2011 when they reached over 168,000 PGP applicants with projected wait times of 6 -11 years for those in the queue.\n[32] In 2002, the Government implemented a major overhaul of its immigration framework with the introduction of a new immigration act, IRPA, and then the IRPA Regulations.\n[33] In a 2006 affidavit presented by Dr. Attaran (Exhibit 16), a senior executive of the Respondent, David Manicom, states at paragraphs 28 and 29:\n28. \u201cTo my knowledge, during the years prior to 2001, there was little or no difference between the \u201ctarget ranges\u201d set out in the Annual Reports to Parliament, and the actual number of sponsored applications seeking immigrant visas from members of the Family Class.\u201d\n29. \u201cThere was no significant accumulation of cases in inventory because the number of Parents and Grandparents applying as sponsored immigrants, roughly matched the numbers of Parents and Grandparents that Canada wished to admit to Canada each year.\u201d\n[34] In 2009 when Dr. Attaran applied to sponsor his parents, the upper limit of the target range in the Levels Plan for the number of PGPs to be admitted as permanent residents that year was 19,000. However, as of 2009, there were 95,597 pending applications in the inventory for the PGP category. In order not to exceed the targets in the Levels Plan each year, the Respondent explained it only processed a limited number of those applications in the inventory queue.\nVII. THE EXPERIENCE OF DR. ATTARAN AND HIS PARENTS [35] Mr. Tetford examined Exhibits 2, 3 and 82 relating to the Complainant\u2019s application. Mr. Tetford confirmed the Part 1 sponsorship application was stamped as received by CPC-Mississauga on July 14, 2009. He also explained a letter from the Respondent at page 52 of Exhibit 3. This letter from IRCC to Dr. Attaran is dated March 30, 2012. The letter states: \u201cWe are now ready to begin processing of your sponsorship application and require additional information.\u201d The letter contains a checklist of required documents and asks the sponsor to return them within 90 days.\n[36] Mr. Tetford explained that this letter indicates that Dr. Attaran\u2019s application, submitted in July 2009, was now being actively processed in March 2012, some 32 months later. When asked what happened to Dr. Attaran\u2019s sponsorship application between July 2009 and May 2012, Mr. Tetford replied that it was essentially just \u201csitting on a shelf\u201d waiting for its turn to be processed when it came up through the queue (Mr. Tetford\u2019s examination in chief on February 8, 2021.)\n[37] According to the evidence in Exhibit 3, the additional documents requested in the March 30, 2012, letter were received by CPC-M on May 9, 2012. Mr. Tetford examined other parts of the file and confirmed that after the updated documents were provided by Dr. Attaran, the Part 1 sponsorship application was approved on May 28, 2012, only 19 days after the receipt of the requested documents. The entire application was finalized on December 13, 2012, when permanent resident visas were issued to Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents.\n[38] It is apparent that, of the total time between when IRCC received Dr. Attaran\u2019s sponsorship application and when his parents\u2019 permanent residence visas were issued, the application spent the great majority of it\u2019s time in the backlog queue. The active processing time was relatively short. After the application had been \u201ctaken down off the shelf\u201d in March 2012, IRCC\u2019s total processing time for the Attaran family reunification was less than nine months.\n[39] The Complainant and his father, Dr. Kazem Attaran, both testified before the Tribunal about their experience and the hardship caused by the long wait to have the application processed.\n[40] The Complainant emphasized how important it was for his children to have a close relationship with their grandparents. He testified that he had been born and raised in California. However, as his parents were immigrants to the U.S. from Iran, he did not have much of a relationship with his own grandparents who remained in Iran. The Complainant also testified that when he applied to sponsor his parents, he and his wife were planning to have children. It was his hope that his parents could be in Canada as permanent residents to support him and his wife when the children arrived. He testified that when his first child was born in 2012, his parents provided childcare, cooked for the family and helped him and his wife maintain their careers.\n[41] The Complainant also testified that until his parents became permanent residents in early 2013, it was not possible for them to obtain provincial health care coverage or to access Canadian banking and other services. After they became permanent residents, his parents bought a house about a block away from his in Ottawa. Once they became permanent residents, Dr. Attaran said his parents no longer had a fear of being refused entry into Canada and they could begin to live the life they wanted to in Canada.\n[42] Dr. Kazem Attaran testified that his son, the Complainant, was their only child. Before he became a permanent resident, Dr. Kazem Attaran usually visited his son and his family for 2-3 weeks maximum. After becoming a permanent resident, they bought a house in Ottawa and (prior to the pandemic in 2020) usually stayed 1.5 - 2 months each time they came to Canada. On cross examination, the Complainant\u2019s father stated that he and his wife spent roughly 50% of their time in Canada from 2013-2020. He explained that he owns three properties in California, including his principal residence which sits on a two-acre lot. If it remains vacant for more than 30 days, he has an issue with the insurance. He also testified that he and his wife maintain health care coverage in California where he receives a pension as a retired civil servant. Dr. Kazem Attaran also testified that he never had any problems entering Canada as a visitor prior to obtaining his permanent resident status.\nVIII. TERMINOLOGY [43] Throughout the hearing and in the written submissions, certain terminology was used by the parties to describe the process and factors which gave rise to this complaint. Unfortunately, at times the terminology was not consistent and it has led to some confusion. Distinguishing the different parts of the application process, from receipt at IRCC to final determination, and using consistent terminology for this, is important for bringing the alleged discriminatory practices into focus. For clarity in these reasons, I set forth below the meaning of the terminology used herein.\n[44] Inventory means the number of undecided applications in the possession of IRCC at any given time. Mr. Tetford explained that in order to reach the processing targets for each sub-category of immigrant types in the Levels Plan, there needs to be a level of \u201cinventory\u201d of pending applications in each sub-category from which IRCC can draw in its attempt to reach the processing targets. Not having enough pending applications in Inventory would be a problem for reaching the targets.\n[45] Backlog means the number of applications in the possession of IRCC in excess of what would be reasonably required in order for IRCC to meet its processing targets in that category in any given year. Mr. Tetford testified that having too many pending applications in Inventory would lead to backlogs, as IRCC generally aimed to not exceed the upper range of the targets set in the Levels Plan.\n[46] Processing Time refers to the global amount of time an applicant waits, from the moment the application is received by IRCC, until the time a final determination is made. Respondent witness Mr. Simon Cardinal testified that IRCC refers to \u201cprocessing time\u201d as the combination of both backlog wait times and application review wait times. (Direct Examination of Simon Cardinal on September 20, 2021 at 2:19:50, Respondent Factum, para. 119.)\n[47] Backlog Wait Time refers to the time when an application is received at a Case Processing Centre but sits in a queue waiting for review by an IRCC officer.\n[48] Application Review Wait Time refers to the amount of time an IRCC officer spends actively working on the application towards its final determination.\nIX. WITNESSES\n[49] Both the Complainant and the Respondent called witnesses to testify at the hearing. The Commission and CSALC did not call any witnesses of their own.\n[50] The Complainant was a witness at the hearing, appearing on his own behalf. His examination in chief was led by counsel for the CHRC. Dr. Attaran is very articulate and answered most questions candidly. He was reluctant to give any indication about how much time his parents had spent in Canada since becoming permanent residents in 2013. He did offer to follow up with that information if he could locate his parents\u2019 permanent resident card renewal applications, but the information was not presented to the Tribunal if it was provided to the Respondent. The Respondent\u2019s cross-examination of the Complainant lasted less than 10 minutes.\n[51] The Complainant\u2019s second witness was his father, Dr. Kazem Attaran. Dr. Kazem was also very articulate and answered questions candidly and in detail.\n[52] The final witness for the Complainant was Prof. Susan Chuang, who appeared before the Tribunal as an expert witness. Prof. Chuang is an Associate Professor in the Department of Family Relations and Applied Nutrition at the University of Guelph. Dr. Chuang was qualified as an expert in human development and family studies, having conducted research in immigration and settlement in Canada\u2019s diverse socio-cultural context. She prepared a 21-page report dated September 11, 2019 for the Tribunal. Dr. Chuang has previous experience as an expert witness. Prof. Chuang\u2019s qualification as an expert and delivery of her expert report, including cross-examinations, was completed over the course of one day of hearing.\n[53] The Respondent called three lay witnesses and one expert witness.\n[54] The first witness for the Respondent was Mr. Glen Tetford, Assistant Director in the IRCC\u2019s Humanitarian and Migration Office in Mississauga (CPC-Mississauga). He was called to give evidence from an operations perspective. From 2009-2017, Mr. Tetford held various positions at CPC-Mississauga that were related to the processing of Family Class sponsorship applications. His evidence was very helpful to the Tribunal in setting the context in which the Complainant\u2019s application was handled by the Respondent.\n[55] The second witness of the Respondent was called to give evidence concerning IRCC policy. Mr. Glen Bornais worked at the Respondent since 2006. At the time of his evidence, he was a Senior Advisor to the Director General in the Strategic Policy and Planning Branch of the Respondent. Up until 2018, he was a Senior Analyst and then an Assistant Director in the same branch. His primary duties involved assisting senior management in the annual levels exercise to prepare recommendations for Cabinet consideration and also dealing with backlog elimination strategies.\n[56] Dr. Attaran submits that Mr. Bornais was not a credible witness and strongly recommends that the Tribunal not rely on his testimony. Mr. Bornais was a witness at this hearing for three-and-a-half days, and was cross-examined by Dr. Attaran for one-and-a-half days. Dr. Attaran completed his cross-examination of Mr. Bornais, who was then scheduled to be cross-examined by the Commission when the hearing was to resume one week later. (Dr. Attaran did reserve the right to recall Mr. Bornais for cross-examination as his testimony made reference to certain documents that had not been previously disclosed. Dr. Attaran later brought a written motion for the disclosure of those documents.)\n[57] However, before the hearing resumed the Tribunal was advised by Respondent counsel that Mr. Bornais had a health issue that would prevent him from returning to the witness stand at any time in this proceeding.\n[58] The Complainant and the Commission both raised concerns about excusing an important witness when his testimony is incomplete. I asked counsel for the Respondent to submit a medical letter to confirm the condition impacting the witness and his stated inability to return to the witness stand at any point. I assured Respondent counsel the letter would be subject to a confidentiality order. When the first medical letter was submitted, both Dr. Attaran and the Commission raised concerns that it was inadequate, written by a doctor who did not acknowledge having a good knowledge of the patient\u2019s condition, and not providing any clinical diagnosis of any illness. I concurred with their concerns and asked the Respondent counsel in writing to provide a more comprehensive medical letter to alleviate the concerns of the other parties.\n[59] The second letter was moderately better than the first, although also authored by the same doctor at a clinic in Ottawa. At paragraph 205 of his Factum, Dr. Attaran alleges the second letter bears several hallmarks of possible forgery. He alleges that the Respondent\u2019s refusal to put this doctor forward as a witness is suspicious. Dr. Attaran observes in his Reply Factum (at paras. 31-35) that the Respondent chose to file no evidence which might authenticate the doctor\u2019s letter. Furthermore, Dr. Attaran notes s. 31.1 of the Canada Evidence Act stipulates that for documents in electronic form (the doctor\u2019s letter is a PDF file) the burden is on the Respondent to prove authenticity. Where there is no appearance of inauthenticity, then authenticity is just assumed and not challenged. Where authenticity is challenged, Dr. Attaran asserts that some evidence must be introduced to establish that the document is what it purports to be.\n[60] Dr. Attaran concludes that the Tribunal must draw an adverse inference from the Respondent\u2019s failure to file evidence of any illness (at para. 214 of his Factum.) In the alternative, if testimony of this witness is admitted, it should not be given weight.\n[61] Dr. Attaran also attacks the credibility of Mr. Bornais based on the manner in which he answered questions during cross-examination. There were numerous long pauses after questions had been posed and Dr. Attaran described the witness as evasive (at para. 207 of Complainant\u2019s Factum.)\n[62] The Respondent explains the long pauses of their witness due to \u201cobjectionable questions relating to cabinet confidences\u201d (at para. 50 of the Respondent\u2019s Factum.) They also call the allegation of forgery baseless (para. 54 of Respondent\u2019s Factum.) The Respondent states that the attack on Mr. Bornais\u2019 credibility is both unnecessary and unwarranted. They also observe that all of the parties have relied on Mr. Bornais\u2019 testimony and the exhibits to which he spoke in their final arguments.\n[63] It was unfortunate that Mr. Bornais was unable to complete his testimony. The allegation of forgery occurred late in the proceeding and the Respondent only responded to the allegation as being baseless. If the forgery allegation had been made earlier during the hearing, perhaps corroborating evidence might have been forthcoming. As such, I will not speculate that Mr. Bornais\u2019 failure to return to the witness stand was anything other than what was presented. However, I would agree with Dr. Attaran that Mr. Bornais was not a spontaneous and frank witness under cross-examination. There were numerous, long silent pauses, even after I tried to be helpful by re-phrasing certain contentious questions that were put to him.\n[64] While the circumstances of Mr. Bornais\u2019 testimony were less than ideal, he did give valuable evidence upon which all the parties relied. His reluctance during parts of his cross-examination related to the Levels Plan creation by Cabinet and what went into that process. However, I did not find reason to doubt the veracity of the evidence that Mr. Bornais gave. I believe he was being truthful when he did answer questions. He stated his reluctance was related to what he perceived were his duties of confidentiality concerning Cabinet privilege.\n[65] The final lay witness for the Respondent was Mr. Simon Cardinal. Mr. Cardinal worked with IRCC for 13 years. His evidence came mostly from his experience as a Director with the Operations Planning and Performance Branch which he testified played a role in meeting the targets set out in the Levels Plan. Mr. Cardinal was on the witness stand for five of the hearing days, which included four days of cross-examination. Mr. Cardinal was generally a helpful witness, but at times was hesitant when answering questions which he felt might conflict with his professional obligations.\n[66] In response to the Complainant\u2019s expert witness, the Respondent commissioned its own expert report authored by Prof. Michael Haan, an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Western Ontario. Prof. Haan was the Canada Research Chair in Migration and Ethnic Relations and also the Canada Research Chair in Population and Social Policy. At the hearing, Prof. Haan was qualified as an expert in the areas of immigration, demography, Canadian labour markets, data development, data infrastructure and the residential choices of newcomers to Canada.\n[67] Dr. Attaran and the Commission vigorously opposed Prof. Haan\u2019s qualifications as an expert and opposed the introduction of his report. As a result, he was cross-examined on his expertise for the better part of two hearing days. There was an entire afternoon of argument about whether or not the Tribunal should accept Professor Haan as an expert at all. Dr. Attaran and the Commission both argued that I should follow the tests outlined in White Burgess Langille Inman v. Abbott and Haliburton Co. (2015 SCC 23) (White Burgess). They argued that Professor Haan should not be accepted as an expert witness on several grounds. They also argued that the four principles in R. v. Mohan, (1994 2 SCR 9 (\u201cMohan\u201d), namely relevance, necessity, absence of any exclusionary rule, and the expert being properly qualified, should be applied.\n[68] The Mohan and White Burgess tests had been rigorously applied in a previous ruling by a different member of this Tribunal in Christoforou v John Grant Haulage Ltd. (2016 CHRT 14) (Christoforou.) In that case, Member Bryan made a strict application of those tests in her ruling which excluded the respondent\u2019s expert report and testimony. Dr. Attaran and the Commission made long argument that I should follow the decision in Christoforou by making a strict application of the Mohan and White Burgess tests. In their view, Prof. Haan was not properly qualified to address the broad range of subjects in his expert report, which had been in their possession for more than one year by the time he testified. Dr. Attaran called Prof. Haan \u201cthe Swiss army knife of experts\u201d because, in his view, Prof. Haan\u2019s expert report spoke to topics on which he was not truly expert.\n[69] In his submissions, Respondent counsel Stynes noted that in the Christoforou ruling, long-time senior Commission counsel, Daniel Poulin, had argued the exact opposite. As a party representing the public interest, Maitre Poulin took the position that the Tribunal should be more liberal in its approach, using its discretion under s. 50(3)(c) to accept the evidence. Some of his arguments were noted in the following paragraphs of Christoforou:\n[34] The Commission further submitted that:\nTo dismiss the report[s] as requested by the Complainant would impose onerous obligations on parties before the Tribunal in future cases and would over judicialize the process before the Tribunal. Ultimately, it would be inconsistent with the necessary flexibility of the Tribunal\u2019s process and would create obstacles for unrepresented complainants in the future.\n[41] The Commission submits the Complainant\u2019s motion cannot succeed without allowing for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence the witnesses will provide, and cites FNCFCS. The Commission submits: \u201cthe Rules do not contain a section to exclude an expert report and the Tribunal must be cautious not to resort to extraordinary measures such as striking out a large segment of a party\u2019s evidence.\u201d\n[70] In light of those submissions in the Christoforou case and the public interest duty to assist the Tribunal, Mr. Stynes said he found it \u201cunbelievable\u201d that the Commission was taking the exact opposite position in this case. (Hearing recording at 1:57 on April 28, 2021.)\n[71] After allowing lengthy oral arguments on the admissibility of Prof. Haan and his expert report, I took my decision under reserve at the end of the hearing day. On the morning of April 29, 2021, I delivered my ruling and advised that I would provide more fulsome reasons in this final decision.\n[72] I advised the parties orally that I would accept Prof. Haan and his report under the broad discretion afforded me under s. 50(3)(c) of the CHRA, which reads as follows:\n50 (3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(c) subject to subsections (4) and (5), receive and accept any evidence and other information, whether on oath or by affidavit or otherwise, that the member or panel sees fit, whether or not that evidence or information is or would be admissible in a court of law;\n[73] I am more persuaded by the Commission\u2019s argument in Christoforou that the Tribunal should remain flexible and not over judicialize the process, in particular given the number of self-represented complainants who appear before it.\n[74] Previous rulings by a Tribunal member are not binding in subsequent matters before the CHRT. In my opinion, the Christoforou ruling was an outlier decision. By contrast, the Tribunal generally has a propensity to admit evidence under its broad discretion afforded under s. 50(3)(c).\n[75] I advised the Complainant and Commission orally that their arguments were well-noted and that they would have the opportunity to argue against the report\u2019s weight and relevance later.\n[76] Prof. Haan was cross-examined over the course of eight hearing days. Dr. Attaran\u2019s questioning shed light on a number of deficiencies in the expert report and they were well-noted. In the end, however, there is little evidence in Prof. Haan\u2019s report, or in his testimony, that I rely upon in this decision.\nX. PRELIMINARY ISSUES\n[77] The parties raised two important issues which need to be addressed first. The Respondent argues that the complaint is moot. The Complainant argues that the Federal Court of Appeal made findings in Attaran v. Canada (Attorney General), 2015 FCA 37 (\u201dAttaran-FCA\u201d) on elements of the prima facie test that bind the Tribunal in this inquiry.\nA. IS THE COMPLAINT MOOT? [78] The Respondent argues that this complaint is moot and it is not in the interest of justice to hear the complaint. In their view, there is no live controversy between the parties as the complaint concerns events that occurred between 2009 and 2012. Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents have been permanent residents of Canada since 2013 and therefore, Dr. Attaran no longer has a personal stake in PGP sponsorship. Furthermore, since the time Dr. Attaran made his application, there have been sweeping changes to the PGP program and the lengthy backlogs which affected him and his family no longer exist.\n[79] The Complainant argues that the complaint is not moot. He cites the decision of the Federal Court in his judicial review application (2013 FC 1132) which found the complaint was not moot (at paragraph 47) due to allegations of systemic discrimination and the fact that processing times remained high at that time. Dr. Attaran argues further that the Federal Court of Appeal would not have ruled in his favour if the complaint was indeed moot. In his view, this issue has already been decided by the Federal Court, it is res judicata and cannot be relitigated.\n[80] The Commission argues the complaint is not moot. They argue that the Tribunal should proceed to determine liability and award appropriate remedies if it is determined there has been a violation of the CHRA. They say there is evidence of systemic discrimination and that the complaint seeks redress for past transgressions for Dr. Attaran and others like him.\n[81] The Respondent cites the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Borowski v. Canada (1989 1 SCR 342) and suggests the mootness analysis should proceed in two stages. The first question is whether a live controversy remains that affects or may affect the rights of the parties. A decision of the Court that will have no practical effect on the parties is moot. If the proceeding is moot, a second question arises: whether the court should nonetheless exercise its discretion to hear and decide it. The Supreme Court cautions hearing decisions that may be moot, and that exercise of discretion should consider whether a dispute between the parties continues to exist, the principles of judicial economy, and whether consideration of a moot argument will lead to unnecessary precedent implying a departure from the adjudicative role into the legislative domain.\n[82] There is no live controversy concerning the finalization of Dr. Attaran\u2019s sponsorship (Part 1) or his parents\u2019 immigration application (Part 2). The complaint was never about whether his parents would be granted permanent residence, but rather the length of time it took for the applications to be processed. His parents landed as permanent residents long before his complaint was referred to this Tribunal. The question is whether Dr. Attaran and his parents were the victims of prohibited discrimination under the CHRA, including whether his complaint establishes systemic discrimination, and if so, what remedies may be appropriate.\n[83] The CHRA is an act of Parliament which seeks to restore victims of discrimination to the place they would be if there had been no discrimination. The remedy powers granted to the Tribunal under the CHRA are broad, including the potential for orders to make available rights, opportunities or privileges that have been denied, and compensation for certain expenses. In addition, quite symbolically, victims may be awarded damages for pain and suffering caused by the discriminatory conduct. Further, s. 53(3) permits an award for special damages under circumstances where a respondent\u2019s wrongful conduct was determined to be reckless or wilful.\n[84] This complaint before the Tribunal is about the manner in which Dr. Attaran and his parents were treated, and how similar applicants in the PGP category were treated, not the final outcome of those applications. It has always been open that the alleged adverse differential treatment could lead to a finding of liability that could properly imply individual and\/or public interest remedies. The complaint is not moot.\nB. DID THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEAL MAKE FINDINGS IN ATTARAN-FCA ON ELEMENTS OF THE PRIMA FACIE TEST THAT BIND THE TRIBUNAL IN THIS INQUIRY? [85] Dr. Attaran asserts that several issues have already been determined by the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) in his judicial review application. In addition to the point on mootness above, Dr. Attaran asserts the fact the Respondent engaged in adverse differential treatment on the grounds of family status is res judicata in Attaran-FCA. In his view, the Tribunal\u2019s hands are bound by these findings and it would be an error of law for the Tribunal to determine otherwise (paras. 10-12 of Complainant\u2019s Factum.)\n[86] As mentioned above, the Commission initially dismissed Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint in July of 2011, finding that an inquiry by the Tribunal was not warranted. When Dr. Attaran\u2019s application for judicial review was dismissed by the Federal Court, he appealed to the FCA. In Attaran-FCA, the FCA was split 2-1 in his favour, with Justices Webb and Stratas concurring in the result to say that Commission\u2019s decision not to refer the complaint to the Tribunal was unreasonable. In coming to that conclusion, Justices Webb and Stratas made comments about the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the complaint.\n[87] Justice Webb wrote the majority reasons for judgment, after observing at the hearing of the Appeal that both parties focused on whether there was a bona fide justification for the differential treatment:\n[8] The conclusion of the Federal Court Judge was that the CHRC\u2019s rationale for not referring this matter to the Tribunal was based on whether there was a bona fide justification for the practice. While both parties, in this appeal, made their submissions on the assumption that the CHRC had based its decision on whether there was a bona fide justification for the practice, as discussed below, it is far from clear that this was the basis for the decision of the CHRC. (ibid. paragraph 8.)\n[88] At paragraph 31 of his reasons, Justice Webb speaks further about the CHRC decision:\n[31] While the CHRC notes that \u201cit does not appear that (CIC) treated the complainant in an adverse differential manner based on age\u201d, there is no reference to the issue of whether CIC treated the complainant differently based on family status. The CHRC also refers to a reasonable explanation for the different treatment of the sponsorship applications for parents and grandparents. The CHRC, however, does not refer in this letter to bona fide justification or undue hardship.\n[89] At paragraph 19 of the decision, Justice Webb states that the Commission implicitly accepted that whether a person is a parent establishes the ground of family status:\n[19] The prohibited grounds of discrimination, as set out in section 3 of the CHRA, include family status. The CHRC implicitly accepted that differential treatment based on whether a person is a parent or a spouse (or child) would be differential treatment based on family status. The Attorney General did not raise any issue in relation to this interpretation of family status.\n[90] Justice Webb noted that the Commission appeared to accept the presence of a discriminatory practice and appeared to have concluded that Ministerial discretion was a justification. However, under the CHRA, if a discriminatory practice is found, then possible justifications are limited to the statutory defences. Justice Webb emphasized that Ministerial discretion is not a statutory justification under the CHRA at paragraph 35:\n[35] The reference to an explanation that is \u201creasonable and non-pretextual\u201d in the decision of the CHRC implies that the explanation would support a finding that the practice was not a discriminatory practice within the meanings of sections 5 to 14.1 of the CHRA. However, the CHRC, in the part of its decision referred to above, appears to acknowledge that the practice is a discriminatory practice, justified based on ministerial discretion. Ministerial discretion, however, is not one of the recognized exceptions under the CHRA. Since undue hardship must be established \u201cconsidering health, safety and cost\u201d (subsection 15(2) of the CHRA), ministerial discretion, without more, could not support a finding that undue hardship would be imposed on CIC if it were to process the sponsorship applications for parents more quickly.\n[91] In his concurring reasons at paragraph 52(1), Justice Stratas gave different reasons for finding the Commission\u2019s decision unreasonable. Justice Stratas examines the claim by CIC that its resources were scarce and therefore had to be allocated based on differing levels of dependance the two groups of family members had on their Canadian sponsors. Not only did he find this to be a blanket statement based on stereotypes, Justice Stratas found the explanation to underscore that in this case, \u201cCIC made distinctions based on family status.\u201d\n[92] The Respondent counsel disagrees with the argument that these statements in Attaran-FCA bind this panel in this decision on the question of whether some or all elements of the prima facie test had been established. While decisions of the FCA are generally binding on the Tribunal, in Attaran-FCA, the FCA was exercising a judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint and not refer it to the Tribunal. In that context, they argue, statements relating to elements of the prima facie test by the FCA do not bind the Tribunal.\n[93] I agree with the Respondent on this point. In the judicial review, the FCA evaluated the reasonableness of the Commission\u2019s decision not to refer the complaint to the Tribunal. Under the scheme of the CHRA, the Commission does not decide the merits of a complaint. That is the role of the Tribunal.\n[94] The Supreme Court of Canada described the nature of a Nova Scotia Human Rights Commission\u2019s decision to refer a complaint to the Tribunal in Halifax (Regional Municipality) v. Nova Scotia (Human Rights Commission) (2012 SCC 10) (\u201cHalifax\u201d) at para. 19:\nThe Commission\u2019s decision to refer a complaint to a board of inquiry is not a determination of whether the complaint falls within the Act. Rather, within the scheme of the Act, the Commission plays an initial screening and administrative role; it may, for example, decide to refer a complaint to a board of inquiry so that the board can resolve a jurisdictional matter.\n[95] This is consistent with the structure of the complaint process under the CHRA and the fact that the Tribunal hears the evidence of witnesses and enters documentary exhibits. The Tribunal makes findings of fact, determines credibility and ultimately decides on the merit of the complaint based on the record before it. The Commission does none of those things.\n[96] It would be contrary to the scheme of the CHRA and prejudicial to the parties to hold that the referral decision (and any review of that decision) could bind or otherwise fetter the discretion of the Tribunal to determine the merits of the Complaint. The record before the Tribunal is not the same as it was before the Commission or the Federal Court and FCA.\n[97] Furthermore, there are significant issues argued before this panel that were not addressed by the Federal Court or the FCA. Most notable is the issue of whether the complaint implicates a service.\n[98] For the foregoing reasons, I consider the findings on the judicial review in the Federal Court and the FCA\u2019s comments on elements of the prima facie test, which Dr. Attaran asserts are binding on the Tribunal, are not binding on the Tribunal now when considering the merits of the complaint.\nXI. DISCRIMINATION LAW AND BURDEN OF THE COMPLAINANT [99] The purpose of the CHRA is to ensure that all individuals have an opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated, consistent with their duties and obligations as members of society, without being hindered or prevented from doing so by discriminatory practices based on prohibited grounds of discrimination (s. 2 of the CHRA.)\n[100] It is well established that a complainant has to meet his or her burden of proof on a balance of probabilities to establish a prima facie case. A prima facie case is \u201cone which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\u201d (Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536, at p. 558).\n[101] To prove a prima facie case of discrimination here, the Complainant is required to show:\nthat he had a characteristic protected from discrimination under the CHRA;\nthat he experienced an adverse impact in the provision of a service by the Respondent; and\nthat the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact (Moore v. B.C. (Education), 2012 SCC 61 (Moore), para. 33).\n[102] A respondent can either present evidence to refute the allegation of prima facie discrimination, meaning that no discriminatory practice is established, or put forward a defence justifying the discriminatory practice, or do both (see Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) v. Bombardier Inc., (Bombardier Aerospace Training Center), 2015 SCC 39, at para. 64). Where the respondent refutes the allegation, its explanation must be reasonable. It cannot be a pretext to conceal discrimination (Khiamal v. Canada, 2009 FC 495, at para. 58).\nXII. MOORE TEST PART 1: THE COMPLAINANT HAS ESTABLISHED THAT HE HAS ONE OR MORE PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS UNDER THE CHRA\n[103] Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint alleges discrimination on the grounds of family status, age (of his parents), race and national or ethnic origin (para. 2 of Complainant\u2019s Factum). Dr. Attaran\u2019s written arguments focused on age and family status, while the CSALC focused their arguments on race, national and ethnic origin. The Commission has endorsed the arguments made by both these parties (Commission Factum, para. 58).\n[104] There is no dispute between the parties that Dr. Attaran has established that he has characteristics which are protected under the CHRA.\n[105] Family status and age were the prohibited grounds referenced in the original complaint. Upon a written motion I permitted Dr. Attaran to add the prohibited grounds of race, and national or ethnic origin (see 2017 CHRT 21). After the ruling, I asked the parties to submit revised SOPs in early 2019 to reflect this and another ruling in favour of the Respondent. Although certain parts were changed, Dr. Attaran did not amend his SOP to include the two additional prohibited grounds allowed in my ruling. Ordinarily, failure to set out proposed argument in an SOP could preclude a party from making that argument at hearing or in final submissions. However, the Respondent did not take that position in this case, and indeed, the error was so obvious that I view this as a procedural oversight. Accordingly, I will address each of the four alleged prohibited grounds below.\nA. Race and National or Ethnic Origin [106] The evidence established that Dr. Attaran was born in San Diego, California and he testified that he identifies as a visible minority of Iranian descent and ethnically Persian. The evidence was uncontroversial that his parents, Dr. Kazem Attaran and Ms. Nasrin Attaran, were born in Iran and became citizens of the United States of America following their move there in 1962 to pursue studies. I am satisfied that Dr. Attaran has the protected characteristics of race and national and ethnic origin.\nB. Family Status\n[107] The Complainant testified that he has two children. His familial relationship with his parents and the fact that he is a parent and his parents are elderly are at the heart of this complaint. The CHRA does not define the ground of \u201cfamily status\u201d, but it is well-established that it has been afforded an inclusive interpretation in the jurisprudence. (See Commission Factum, para. 60; B v Ontario (Human Rights Commission), 2002 SCC 66.) The Commission devotes lengthy written arguments explaining why family status includes the parent-child (and parent and grandparent) relationship. This point was not in dispute by the Respondent.\n[108] Family status has been afforded a broad interpretation in the leading jurisprudence. In a leading Tribunal decision concerning family status, Johnstone v. Canada Border Services (2010 CHRT 20), Member Findlay sets out the reasons for including childcare responsibilities, of the type and duration experienced by Ms. Johnstone, under the heading of family status.\n[109] Fewer cases before the CHRT have sought the inclusion of the adult child to parent relationship as part of the family status prohibited ground. The issue was considered by Member Johnson in Waddle v. Canadian Pacific Railway and Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (2017 CHRT 24) (\u201cWaddle\u201d). Ultimately, Member Johnson did not find the complainant in that case brought forth sufficient evidence to substantiate the complaint on the basis of his obligations for eldercare to his parents. However, the decision did consider the earlier CHRT decision in Hicks v. Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (2013 CHRT 20) (\u201cHicks\u201d). In Hicks, the Tribunal member made clear that the obligations of a child to an elderly parent could also be recognized in the context of a family status claim (Hicks, para 44). The Tribunal\u2019s finding on this point was upheld on judicial review to the Federal Court (see Canada (Attorney General) v. Hicks, 2015 FC 599 at para. 66).\n[110] The Commission cites B v Ontario (supra) to support a broad interpretation of \u201cfamily status.\u201d In further support, the Commission also asks the Tribunal to take into consideration several international human rights instruments on the family. Article 16 of the United Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, among other things, states that \u201c[t]he family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State.\u201d\n[111] Article 10(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights states that \u201c[t]he widest possible protection and assistance should be accorded to the family, which is the natural and fundamental group unit of society, particularly for its establishment and while it is responsible for the care and education of dependent children.\u201d\n[112] The Commission also cites the International Covenant on Social and Political Rights which echoes these fundamental principles providing that \u201c[t]he family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state.\u201d\n[113] In addition to addressing gender equality, much of the International Convention for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women is geared towards ensuring work and family balance. To this effect, Articles 5, 11 and 16 are meant to enable parents to combine family obligations with work responsibilities and participation in public life.\n[114] Finally, the Commission submits, Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires that \u201cin all actions concerning children (\u2026) the best interests of the child shall be the primary consideration.\u201d The Convention also requires Canada to provide the appropriate assistance to parents and guardians to perform child-rearing responsibilities, including all appropriate measures to ensure that children of working parents have the right to benefit from child-care services and facilities for which they are eligible. Accordingly, reliance on parents and grandparents for childcare is a relevant consideration according to the Commission.\n[115] As noted, the Respondent\u2019s final argument does not dispute that the ground of family status is engaged. I am persuaded that the Complainant has established the protected characteristic of \u201cfamily status\u201d under s. 3 of the CHRA.\nC. Age [116] Dr. Attaran also refers to the \u201cage (of his parents)\u201d in his submissions. Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents are not parties to this complaint. However, for this first step of the prima facie test, the Complainant need only show he has the characteristic. He is a mid-life adult, with parents who are necessarily senior to him. (Sadly, Dr. Attaran\u2019s mother passed away while these reasons were under reserve.)\n[117] I have concluded that Dr. Attaran has established these characteristics, which are prohibited grounds for discrimination, on the balance of probabilities (s. 3 of the CHRA): race, national or ethnic origin, family status and age. Whether one or more of these prohibited grounds was a factor in any alleged discriminatory practice is a matter for the next steps of the prima facie test.\nXIII. MOORE TEST PART 2: HAS THE COMPLAINANT ESTABLISHED ADVERSE DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT IN THE PROVISION OF A SERVICE BY THE RESPONDENT?\n[118] To apply section 5 of the CHRA, it must be determined whether the actions complained of occurred \u201cin the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation\u201d (see Watkin v. Canada (Attorney General), 2008 FCA 170 (Watkin) at para. 31).\n[119] Section 5 of the CHRA reads:\n5. It is a discriminatory practice in the provision of goods, services, facilities or accommodation customarily available to the general public\n(a) to deny, or to deny access to, any such good, service, facility or accommodation to any individual, or\n(b) to differentiate adversely in relation to any individual,\non a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[120] A key issue is therefore whether the adverse differential treatment, if any, occurred in the provision of a service by the Respondent. Addressing this issue requires identifying the government actions alleged to be the service. If an adverse differential treatment is established and determined to have occurred in the provision of a service, then it must be determined if a prohibited ground was a factor in the adverse treatment.\n[121] The Tribunal must determine the proper characterization of the service or services in issue. In some previous cases, the Tribunal was able to deal with this question as a preliminary matter. This would be helpful where addressing the question in a preliminary way might completely dispose of the complaint. In this complaint the Complainant and the Commission attacked numerous actions by IRCC, including by the Minister, and plead broad, composite adverse effects, including overly lengthy delay and disproportionately low numbers of PGPs approved in relation to the total number of persons applying for permanent resident status in Canada. The Complainant and Commission also specifically asked the Tribunal not to evaluate certain kinds of government action that influence the procession of applications. As such, this decision must carefully consider the impugned government actions and properly identify the service or services that the Complainant and Commission have put into issue.\nA. THE ALLEGED SERVICE(S) IN ISSUE AND NOT IN ISSUE\n[122] Addressed in more detail below, it was conceded by the Respondent that, in a general sense, the processing of immigration applications by IRCC is a service to the public. However, the Respondent disagreed with what the Complainant and Commission included under the umbrella of \u201cprocessing applications\u201d. The Complainant and Commission alleged that actions with a variety of characteristics were discriminatory practices. The parties did not agree that all the alleged adverse differential treatment occurred during or flowed from the IRCC\u2019s processing of sponsorship applications.\n[123] When comparing the processing of one category of immigration applications to another, it is necessary to look more closely at the various stages of the processing, and what guides and constrains those stages as applications work their way through the system towards finalization. As a result, it is necessary to identify the key kinds of government action that were involved, determine whether they are alleged to be services by the Complainant and Commission, and if so, whether they meet the definition of \u201cservice\u201d in s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[124] In the case of PGP applications, there are four basic evaluations that need to be made: eligibility of the sponsor (Part 1 application); eligibility of the sponsored relatives (Part 2 application); medical examinations to determine admissibility; and background checks to determine admissibility. These four evaluations are governed by statute and regulation which, as discussed below, were not challenged by the Complainant and the Commission.\n[125] The processing of applications is also guided and constrained by other factors, including the Levels Plans and Ministerial Instructions. The Complainant and Commission asked the Tribunal to consider the discretion afforded to the Respondent under the regime for immigration when processing applications, taking account of the provisions of IRPA and the IRPA Regulations, and the target ranges specified in Levels Plans each year by Cabinet. The significance of Levels Plans was highly disputed in this inquiry, as is discussed further below.\n[126] The parties also make allegations concerning Ministerial Instructions, which are also discussed further below.\n[127] In addition, the Complainant alleges that the Minister should have used statutory powers of exemption to eliminate disparities connected to a prohibited ground of discrimination.\n[128] It is important to identify what was within the scope of the IRCC\u2019s authority, and what was imposed by other government actions that were not argued to have been \u201cservices\u201d by the Complainant and Commission, who bear the burden of proof at this stage. In this case, it would be overly broad and superficial to state that because IRCC processes applications, any adverse effect on a group of applicants that connects to a prohibited ground must derive from a discriminatory practice carried out by IRCC.\n[129] The following sections evaluate these various components and their impact on the overall processing of applications. The careful examination of all of these factors is required to resolve this complaint.\nB. THE RESPONDENT DID NOT CONCEDE THAT ITS ACTIONS IN THE PROCESSING OF DR. ATTARAN\u2019S APPLICATION CONSTITUTE A \u201cSERVICE\u201d UNDER THE CHRA.\n[130] The \u201cservices\u201d issue cannot be dismissed in entirety as having been \u201cadmitted\u201d by the Respondent, as Dr. Attaran urged the Tribunal to do. Dr. Attaran argued that it is common ground of the parties that IRCC\u2019s processing of applications is a \u201cservice\u201d under s. 5 of the CHRA. (Complainant Factum, paras. 13-14; Applicant\u2019s Reply Factum, para. 73.) In both submissions, Dr. Attaran asserts that the Respondent\u2019s counsel has conceded so on record in the following exchange:\n\u201cSo Chair Thomas, the issue here is the, of course there\u2019s a legal question before the Tribunal about what\u2019s a service and what\u2019s not. And so that's the scope of the question. And I want to state also, I mean, we don\u2019t dispute that the processing of an application is a service, right, that you know, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re, what the issue is.\u201d (Mr. Stynes on Hearing Recording, February 9, 2021 at 2:36:25.)\n[131] The Complainant submits that since all parties agree that application processing is a service, the Tribunal need not inquire further and should decide the case on that basis. (See Complainant\u2019s Reply Factum, para. 73.)\n[132] Closely related to this argument is the Commission\u2019s submission that the terminology used by IRCC itself concedes that processing is a service. They emphasize evidence where phrasing like \u201cclient service unit\u201d, \u201cclients\u201d and \u201cimmigration services\u201d appears, as indicia that IRCC processing of applications must be a service under s. 5 of the CHRA.\n[133] On this subject, the Complainant adds that in Justice Noel\u2019s obiter in Watkin at para. 31, it was written \u201cImmigration Canada provides a service\u201d in relation to acquiring permanent residency (Complainant\u2019s Reply Factum at para. 76.) He adds that taking this at face value, \u201cImmigration Services\u201d are a service.\n[134] I find the Complainant\u2019s initial argument regarding Respondent counsel\u2019s concession that processing is a service to be unpersuasive. When taken in context, the Respondent has made no such concession. The Respondent conceded that review of sponsorship applications by an IRCC officer can be a \u201cservice\u201d, but they argue that the Complainant and Commission have not established that IRCC engaged in a discriminatory practice in providing the service of processing applications. Furthermore, the Respondent specifically argued that Ministerial Instructions are not a service, and Levels Plans are not a service. The Respondent\u2019s acknowledgement that the IRCC provides a service when processing applications did not include the Minister\u2019s issuance of Ministerial Instructions or Cabinet\u2019s approval of Levels Plans as subcomponents of \u201cprocessing\u201d.\n[135] Within the array of discriminatory measures IRCC is alleged to have taken, the Respondent argued that the true source of delays in processing applications in this complaint was the Levels Plans, which caused the Backlog Wait Time. The Respondent further argued that Ministerial Instructions are not a service, and that the Complainant and the Commission have made indirect attacks on the IRPA Regulations, which the Respondent says are not a \u201cservice\u201d. It would be misguided to disregard the Respondent\u2019s substantive submissions on a question of central importance to this case based on a mischaracterization of their concession.\n[136] Likewise, I do not accept that generic terms in internal or public records like \u201cprocessing\u201d, \u201cclient services\u201d and \u201cimmigration services\u201d are conclusive of a \u201cservice\u201d within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA. A semantic argument cannot replace a required sober analysis based on the particular facts and context of the case.\n[137] I would add in regard to the Complainant\u2019s reference to Justice Noel\u2019s obiter in Watkin, the full quotation is: \u201cImmigration Canada provides a service when it advises immigrants about how to become a Canadian resident.\u201d (Watkin at para. 28, emphasis added). Justice Noel\u2019s example was conditional on the specificity of his \u201cwhen\u201d statement which referred to advice offered to the public. This brief statement in obiter should not be inflated so as to bind the Tribunal in any further inquiry about anything to do with the IRCC\u2019s provision of services.\n[138] The Respondent brought a pre-hearing motion in November of 2018 seeking to amend their Statement of Particulars to add a legal argument, not previously raised, that this complaint does not implicate a \u201cservice\u201d under s. 5 of the CHRA. Notwithstanding the eight arguments against put forward by Dr. Attaran (the Commission took no position), I granted the motion (see 2019 CHRT 12). Clearly this is a fundamental argument the Respondent wishes to raise and it would not be appropriate to dismiss it on a superficial basis.\n[139] Therefore, in evaluating whether the Complainant has discharged the burden to establish prima facie discrimination, these reasons must determine whether any of the discriminatory practices alleged occurred in the provision of a service by the Respondent, within the meaning of s. 5 of the CHRA.\nC. THE LAW OF \u201cSERVICES\u201d\n[140] The Supreme Court of Canada considered the term \u201cservices\u201d in Gould v. Yukon Order of Pioneers (1996 1 S.C.R. 571) (Gould). This case involved the refusal to admit Ms. Gould into the fraternal order of the Yukon Order of Pioneers. The main issue in Gould was whether membership in the fraternal order was offered to the \u201cpublic\u201d. The Court held that there is a \u201crequisite public relationship between the service provider and the service receiver, to the extent that the public must be granted access to or admitted to or extended the service by the service provider.\u201d (See para. 55 of Gould.)\n[141] The Supreme Court of Canada further noted in Gould that there is a \u201ctransitive connotation\u201d to the finding of a service, in which a benefit must be held out to the public. \u201c[I]t is not until the service, accommodation, facility, etc., passes from the service provider and has been held out to the public that it attracts the anti-discrimination prohibition.\u201d (Ibid. para. 55.)\n[142] Prior to Watkin, there was a line of authority holding that virtually anything done by government was a \u201cservice\u201d. (Watkin at paras. 24-31.) The FCA in Watkin clearly \u201cdisavowed\u201d this notion and brought more precision to the interpretation of the word \u201cservices\u201d in s. 5 of the CHRA. (Ibid. para 32.) The FCA clarified that the fact that government actions are taken in the public interest and for the public good does not make them \u201cservices\u201d. (paras. 22 and 33.)\n[143] Further clarity was provided by the 2018 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 31, (\u201cMatson\/Andrews\u201d) when the Supreme Court affirmed two CHRT decisions and upheld case law on s. 5 applicable to this context. As a result of Matson\/Andrews, a clear line of case law binding on the Tribunal exists (in addition to Watkin): Forward v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 CHRT 5 (\u201cForward\u201d), Public Service Alliance of Canada et al. v. Canada Revenue Agency et al., 2012 FCA 7, application for leave to appeal refused, (SCC) 2012 CanLII 68761 (\u201cMurphy\u201d) and Matson\/Andrews itself. I will address each in turn as well as Andrews et al v Canada (Indian and Northern Affairs) (2013 CHRT 21) (\u201cAndrews\u201d) and Matson et al v Canada (Indian and Northern Affairs) (2013 CHRT 13) (\u201cMatson\u201d).\n[144] In Forward, two brothers were denied citizenship and the complainants\/Commission argued that the service at issue was the reviewing of applications for citizenship. The Tribunal\u2019s former Chairperson, Grant Sinclair, did not accept this characterization of the complaint. He found that the evidence and argument were not directed at the conduct of ministerial officials, the exercise of their discretion, or at the implementation of departmental policies and practices. The Tribunal ruled that the sole source of the alleged discrimination was the legislative language of the 1977 Citizenship Act. (Forward at paras. 36-38.) Legislation by itself fell beyond the scope of the CHRA. This conclusion was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in Murphy.\n[145] In the Tribunal\u2019s decision in Murphy (2010 CHRT 9), the complainant\/Commission argued that when the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) assesses payable taxes, it performs a service. They brought evidence that taxpayers are referred to as \u201cclients\u201d and also looked at the actions that the CRA staff complete to provide advice that can benefit a taxpayer. The complainant submitted that actions, like putting data into an information system and screening out applicants, came within the meaning of a \u201cservice customarily available to the public\u201d (at paras. 45-46.) The Commission held the assessment of income tax was a service because assisting taxpayers is a benefit held out for the general public (at para. 49).\n[146] Again, this characterization was rejected by the Tribunal. Vice-Chairperson Hadjis ruled that: \u201c(e)ven if the tasks undertaken by the CRA in processing QRLSP claims constitute a service, they are not the basis for the adverse differentiation alleged in the complaint. The source of the alleged discriminatory practice is found solely within the legislative\u201d. The impugned legislation was the Income Tax Act (Ibid. at para 54.)\n[147] The Federal Court of Appeal affirmed this decision and held that complaints aimed at legislation, and nothing else, fall outside the scope of the CHRA. The proper recourse is through a constitutional challenge.\n[148] Then came Matson\/Andrews. Since the Supreme Court of Canada focused its analysis on the principle of deference and the standard of review, it is necessary to review the reasoning on the s. 5 provisions in the first instance decisions.\n[149] In Matson, the Tribunal started its s. 5 analysis by characterizing the government actions that were being challenged. The Tribunal determined whether the challenge was truly against processing of the Complainant\u2019s application for registration under the Indian Act or against something else. Member Lustig held that processing was not truly being challenged. Rather, the \u201csole source of the alleged discrimination in this case is the legislative language of section 6 of the Indian Act.\u201d (Matson at para.59.) To arrive at this result, the Tribunal relied on Watkin: \u201c(\u2026) the first step to be performed in applying section 5 is to determine whether the actions complained of are \u201cservices\u201d (see Gould, supra, per La Forest J., para. 60)\u201d.\n[150] In Matson, the Respondent argued that the challenge was truly against legislation and nothing else. Within the context of parties disagreeing on the nature of the case, the Tribunal chose to particularize the actions as its starting point.\n[151] Member Lustig acknowledged the general proposition in Watkin that \u201c\u2026 \u2018services\u2019 contemplates \u201csomething of benefit being \u2018held out\u2019 as a services and \u2018offered\u2019 to the public\u201d (Watkin, at para. 31). However, Member Lustig found that it was not the respondent department that offered to the public the benefit of entitlement to registration under the Indian Act. The Indian Act itself offered that benefit: \u201c(w)hat the Respondent may offer as a benefit\/service to the public is the processing of applications for registration to determine whether a person should be added to the Indian Register, in accordance with the Indian Act.\u201d (Matson at para. 58.) In that case, the processing of an application by a registrar officer, described as reviewing applications, could have been a service, but the resulting status or lack thereof was not the service offered by the department doing the processing pursuant to the Indian Act\u2019s requirements, nor was the act of legislating those requirements a service.\n[152] In Andrews, the Commission\/complainant again argued that the processing of registration under the Indian Act was a service. First, they argued that Service Canada listed registration as a service on their website. (Andrews at para 43.) Then the Commission analyzed the benefits that registration under the Indian Act provides to argue that they are a service.\n[153] In that case, the Commission submitted that registration under the Indian Act met all the hallmarks used to determine if government conduct qualifies as a service. These indicia included tangible and intangible benefits, benefits being held out to an eligible public and people submitting applications to the Indian Registrar for those benefits to confer. (Andrews at para. 45.)\n[154] However, the respondent did not view entitlement to registration under the Indian Act as a \u201cservice\u201d. The respondent conceded that processing of an application for registration may constitute a \u201cservice\u201d but argued that Parliament\u2019s criteria for identifying who is eligible is not a service. In other words, had the application been processed in a way that differentiated on a prohibited ground in a manner that diverged from the legislative criteria, that could have been a discriminatory practice, but simply applying legislative criteria was not.\n[155] The Tribunal held that Indian status does confer tangible and intangible benefits to the public. However, although Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada (as it was then called), may be a service provider, providing a service to the public, ultimately the services the department provided were not the object of the complaint. The Tribunal characterized the true challenge as a challenge to the Indian Act itself.\n[156] In this case, it would be overly broad and superficial to state that processing times or immigration services writ large are a \u201cservice\u201d under s. 5 of the CHRA. Given Matson\/Andrews and the case law leading up to those decisions, the proper approach is to analyze whether specific government actions that contributed to the longer processing times for the PGP category are captured by s.5(b) of the CHRA.\nD. IRPA AND THE IRPA REGULATIONS NOT ALLEGED TO BE SERVICES\n[157] In this complaint, Parliamentary law-making is not alleged to be a discriminatory practice, nor is regulation-making by Cabinet alleged to be a discriminatory practice. The Tribunal was specifically asked by the Complainant and Commission, whose burden it is to establish the prima facie case, not to determine whether the passage of regulations and levels plan final approvals are \u201cservices\u201d under the CHRA and to focus instead on processing by the IRCC as the impugned service. No party made a direct attack on IRPA (consistent with Matson\/Andrews) and no party made a direct attack on the IRPA Regulations. The Complainant submitted:\nIt is an open question whether the ratio in Matson and Andrews immunizes subordinate legislation such as the IRPA Regulations, as opposed to Acts of Parliament like IRPA itself, from Tribunal review. That legal issue need not, and should not, be decided in this case\u2014 so the Applicant takes no position on it presently. [Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 171, underline in original.]\n[158] The Commission submitted:\nDr. Attaran\u2019s complaint does not target legislation. He does not complain that a piece of legislation is discriminatory, but the way the respondent processes spouses and children at a much faster rate than those of parents and grandparents is discriminatory. [Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 55.]\n[159] To the extent that adverse differentiation on prohibited grounds between types of applicants is imposed on IRCC by IRPA and the IRPA Regulations, that type of adverse differentiation was not pursued as a discriminatory practice under the CHRA by the Complainant and the Commission. Instead, the Complainant and CHRC have asked the Tribunal to look very closely at IRCC\u2019s procedures, processes, and results, including the discretionary authority of the Minister to make Ministerial Instructions that direct IRCC officials\u2019 handling of applications, the implementation of Levels Plans and to grant exemptions to applicants \u201cfrom any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act\u201d (s. 25.2(1) of IRPA.)\n[160] As a result, if the Tribunal determines that binding, mandatory components of IRPA and the IRPA Regulations were the inescapable causes of the adverse differential treatment attributed by the Complainant or Commission to IRCC, then the Complainant and Commission will not have discharged their burden of establishing a discriminatory practice by the IRCC when processing applications. For these same reasons, the question of whether regulation-making is a service will not be determined in these reasons. These questions are not properly before the Tribunal as argued by the Complainant and Commission. Instead, the key question before the Tribunal is whether, in light of the scope of government actions left to IRCC, within a regime that includes IRPA and the IRPA Regulations, IRCC has engaged in a discriminatory practice.\n[161] Consequently, in this decision IRPA, the IRPA Regulations are taken as part of the statutory and regulatory framework within which the Respondent processes applications.\nE. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LEVELS PLANS IN THIS INQUIRY\n[162] The parties took differing views of the significance of Levels Plans and made extensive submissions about them. There was also much evidence before the Tribunal at the hearing about how the Levels Plans are determined and whether the Respondent or Cabinet decides the numbers in the Levels Plans each year.\n[163] Throughout the inquiry, the Respondent explained that the long processing time for the PGP subgroup, experienced by the Attaran family, was a direct result of the Levels Plans having admission target ranges for PGPs that were consistently too low to prevent backlogs from arising. According to the Respondent, the source of the alleged discrimination is not found in the assessment of the sponsorship application, but rather in the number of the available permanent resident spots under the Levels Plan relative to the demand, year after year. (Paras. 2-3 Respondent\u2019s Factum.) They explained that the Levels Plan set the number of admissions for PGPs each year and once those numbers had been reached, the remaining sponsorship applications sat on the shelf until admission space became available in a subsequent year. IRCC could not approve significantly more PGP applications because the Levels Plan did not give them authority to do so. (See Respondent\u2019s SOP at paras 38-39.)\n[164] Before the hearing began, Dr. Attaran took aim at the Levels Plan and how they impacted the processing time for his application. Paragraph 4 of his SOP reads:\n\u201cThe cause of the problem is rather simple: successive governments have, about once a year, issued immigration \u201cLevels Plans\u201d which shuffle Family Class applications for parents and grandparents to the back of the processing queue. The Respondent department, speaking for the Immigration Minister, says they have the statutory discretion to prioritize applications, which is true, but overlooks the fact that when Parliament granted that statutory discretion, it stipulated in both the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) that it must never be employed so as to discriminate \u2013 which he is.\u201d\n[165] While Dr. Attaran here pointed to the influence of Levels Plans in creating fewer admissions spaces for PGPs, and consequently longer processing times, his focus was and remains the Minister\u2019s discretionary powers. At the conclusion of the hearing, Dr. Attaran argues his case has never been about discrimination in how the Cabinet makes its Levels Plan and that he has never demanded Cabinet raise or lower its numbers: \u201cBut nowhere in the oral or written evidence did the Applicant demand the Cabinet increase the level of PGP intake, and nowhere in pleadings did the Applicant allege that Cabinet discriminated by not doing so.\u201d He also states, \u201c\u2026by litigating as if setting the Levels Plan is the alleged discriminatory \u201cservice\u201d, the Respondent\u2019s counsel is in a galaxy far, far away.\u201d (Paras. 114-117 of Complainant\u2019s Factum. Underline in original.)\n[166] The Respondent argues that Dr. Attaran has shifted his argument:\nAfter pleading in his Statement of Particulars that the \u201ccause of the problem is \u2026\u2019Levels Plans\u2019\u201d, the Complainant has now shifted his position and instead, he now argues in his closing submissions that the source of the alleged discrimination was the alleged failure to bring in the legislative and policy reforms to control demand for PGP sponsorship sooner.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Factum at para.7.)\n[167] As is apparent from these exchanges, the parties fundamentally disagreed on whether Levels Plans determine the wait times and impose adverse differentiation among applicants on prohibited grounds, or whether the Minister could have improved the Respondent\u2019s treatment of applicants in the PGP category with the discretionary powers available under IRPA such that that PGP applicants would have been on par with other categories of applicants, such as FC1s.\n[168] The Respondent emphasized that finding the cause of the delays for PGP applicants is critical:\n\u201cThe issue in this case was the wait time before his application could be assessed by an immigration officer. The critical task for the Tribunal in this case is to determine the cause of that wait time.\u201d (Respondent\u2019s Factum at para. 6.)\n[169] In further support of the view that the service or services the Complainant asks the Tribunal to rule on do not include Cabinet\u2019s approval of Levels Plans, the sought remedies outlined in Dr. Attaran\u2019s Factum do not address the Levels Plans. The five main, non-monetary remedies sought by Dr. Attaran are: prospective service standard reform; statistical transparency; operational equality; public accountability; and inclusion of a safety mechanism for emergencies when operational equality cannot be met. All of these remedies speak to the Application Review Wait Time when the file is being actively worked on by an IRCC officer. The sought remedies do not speak to Levels Plan target ranges, the making of Levels Plans or to the problem of applications \u201csitting on the shelf\u201d for long periods of time. (The evidence before the Tribunal showed that in recent years, after the finalization of the Attaran family\u2019s application, the issue of applications \u201csitting on the shelf\u201d for long periods has disappeared due to strict application intake controls.) This supports the view that the Complainant impugns the Respondent\u2019s processing of applications and the Minister\u2019s discretionary powers that the Complainant considers to be part of that processing, and not Levels Plans themselves.\n[170] The Commission also did not allege that Cabinet\u2019s approval of Levels Plans is a service. The Commission\u2019s position on Levels Plans was difficult to follow. The Commission argued, \u201cthe levels plan and the processing of the application are inextricably tied to one another. The levels plan is the supply for the service and therefore an integral part of the supply chain in the delivery of the service.\u201d However, the Commission also says that Levels Plans are \u201cirrelevant\u201d, and the source of the shortage in supply does not matter, again emphasizing that this complaint attacks the downstream processing of applications, not the Levels Plans themselves (Para. 47 of the Commission\u2019s Factum.)\n[171] Notwithstanding the concluding arguments of the Complainant and the Commission that do not attack the Levels Plans themselves, much of the evidence at the hearing and much of the final argument was devoted to the process of establishing the Levels Plans, their significance and what discretion, if any, exists around their implementation. As such, to conclude whether IRCC engaged in discriminatory practices requires a detailed examination of the Levels Plans in the immigration regime.\n[172] As outlined above, s.94(1) of IRPA requires the Minister to table in Parliament an annual report on the operation of IRPA. The required details of the annual report are set out in s.94(2), including s.94(2)(b) which calls for a description of the number of foreign nationals who became permanent residents, and the number projected to become permanent residents in the following year. This description under s.94(2)(b), part of the annual report to Parliament, is a report to Parliament of the Levels Plan, upon which much hinges. Although, as Dr. Attaran points out, the words \u201cLevels Plan\u201d do not appear the legislation.\n[173] It is correct that neither IRPA nor the IRPA Regulations use the term \u201cLevels Plan\u201d which is interesting, given how much the Respondent apparently relies on the Levels Plan to explain how resources are allocated by IRCC to meet the Government\u2019s immigration goals. The documentary evidence at the hearing also showed the Government was inconsistent in the way the Levels Plan was presented in various annual reports. All of the annual reports to Parliament for the years 2008 to 2020 were submitted as exhibits at the hearing. Only the reports for 2009 and 2010 set out the target ranges for the various sub-categories of immigrants, including PGPs. From 2011 onwards, the annual reports did not break down the prospective target ranges for the sub-categories like PGPs and FC1s. In most years, a target range was given for all federally approved selections combined, including economic classes, all family classes and refugees. The immigrants to be selected under Quebec\u2019s unique immigration program were usually set out separately, with just a global target range being given for all immigrants in the coming year.\n[174] During the cross-examination by Dr. Attaran, Mr. Bornais stated that even though target ranges were not broken down into sub-categories of immigrants in the annual reports from 2011 onwards, the target ranges for each group, such as FC1s and PGPs, were posted on the IRCC website each year. Mr. Bornais was unable to explain why the reporting to Parliament changed, not to include the target ranges for the various sub-categories.\n[175] During this cross-examination, the Complainant referred to the breakdown of target ranges for the various sub-categories as the mix. He asked Mr. Bornais about those latter reports to Parliament that did not detail the mix, but instead only set out global target ranges for all immigrants in the economic, family and refuges classes all lumped in together. Dr. Attaran asked, as result of only the global targets being reported to Parliament, if that meant IRCC had flexibility to decide the mix of the various sub-categories within the global targets. Mr. Bornais answered no.\n[176] When Dr. Attaran asked the follow-up question, why, there was an objection from Respondent counsel that the question was delving into matters subject to Cabinet confidence. The witness was excluded and there were lengthy discussions amongst counsel about the question, and whether it was about Cabinet or just IRCC. When the witness returned, I rephrased the question to him. I asked Mr. Bornais why the department did not take the Levels Plan, as reported to Parliament where there was no indication of the mix, to mean there was no mix? There was a very lengthy pause after my question and Mr. Bornais simply answered that the department set out to deliver on the Levels Plan approved by Cabinet. A second re-phrasing of the question yielded another lengthy pause and the same answer. (Cross-examination of Mr. Bornais on February 12, 2021 @ 3:41:50.) It was unclear why Mr. Bornais was avoiding answering the question, as it did not appear to implicate a matter of Cabinet confidence.\n[177] After the exclusion of the witness again, I made the observation that all of the annual reports examined did include a retroactive break-down of target ranges for each of the immigration sub-categories. When reporting on the prior year\u2019s actual admissions, each annual report gave a break-down for each sub-category, including PGPs and FC1s, and compared the prior year\u2019s Levels Plan target range for each sub-category against the actual number of admissions in each.\n[178] Dr. Attaran raised the question of how we are supposed to know if those are Cabinet\u2019s original ranges, or target ranges set by IRCC to fall within the global numbers set out in the reports to Parliament.\n[179] There was other evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that in all years, Cabinet set out specific target ranges for each sub-category, notwithstanding their absence from the annual report to Parliament. For example, Exhibit 32 was a multi-year comparison chart that examined past targets and future target ranges. (This document also noted that some classes of immigrants were shifted into different categories in some years which would explain the appearance of under-reporting. However, this did not impact the reporting of PGP targets and admissions.)\n[180] During another exclusion of the witness, it was suggested by counsel for the Commission that the Tribunal could rely on Mr. Bornais\u2019 oral evidence that the mix of the Levels Plan was posted on the IRCC website each year, setting out the target ranges for each sub-category. Ms. Carrasco also suggested that those website materials could be introduced as exhibits. However, the Complainant objected to their introduction on the grounds of procedural fairness, so they were not admitted into evidence.\n[181] Dr. Attaran also makes the case that IRCC \u2013 not Cabinet \u2013 is the original author of the intake levels in the Levels Plan, and that \u201cCabinet merely chooses from IRCC\u2019s menu of options.\u201d (para. 126 of Complainant\u2019s Factum.)\n[182] Relying on the evidence above, I find that the Levels Plans in those latter years were approved by Cabinet and did include a breakdown of target ranges for the sub-categories each year which guided the department in the same way as in earlier years, when the mix was set out in the annual reports.\n[183] Regarding IRCC\u2019s role in generating proposed levels, it is neither shocking nor determinative that departmental proposals and advice on the Levels Plan would reach Cabinet first (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 135.) Top public servants provide advice to Cabinet on issues of discussion. IRCC may have prepared options, memoranda and even recommendations for the Minister and Cabinet. However, regardless of the degree of assistance given by IRCC, I do not accept the Complainant\u2019s position that the Levels Plans are anything other than a document of the Cabinet. The Cabinet is accountable to Parliament and the Canadian public for its content.\n[184] The Respondent calls the Levels Plan the \u201csource of the discrimination\u201d, a phrase used in Forward and Matson. In the context of this case, they argue that a complaint against Backlog Wait Time is truly a complaint against the Levels Plan allotments set by Cabinet (i.e., the supply side). Put another way, the setting of target ranges in the Levels Plan is the action that gave rise to the allegedly discriminatory delay.\n[185] The Respondent submitted that \u201cwhen Cabinet approves the Levels Plan and the Minister reports it to Parliament under s. 94 of IRPA, it does not provide a service.\u201d Cabinet decisions are analogous to Parliament decisions; they happen at the highest levels of government. Furthermore, the Respondent adds that the Levels Plan does not meet the basic principles to be characterized as a service: members of the public are not transacting \u201cin the provision of a service\u201d when the Levels Plan is set by Cabinet. (Respondent Factum, paras. 196-200.)\n[186] The Commission\u2019s main argument, addressed further below, is that various discriminatory practices occurred in IRCC\u2019s implementation of the Levels Plan. They argue that based on IRCC\u2019s wide discretionary power, the Levels Plan referenced in s. 94 of IRPA is different from clear statutory criteria that the complainants had in Forward, Murphy, and Matson and Andrews. Accordingly, they argue that the ratio in Matson\/Andrews is the wrong framework to follow. The proper starting point is Watkin as described previously. If the source of the discrimination were to matter, they noted that the Levels Plan is not parliamentary law-making and therefore is not immunized from CHRA scrutiny. However, the Commission says the source does not matter: \u201cIt would be onerous to suggest that parties and the Tribunal go behind the service complained each time a government service is implicated\u201d. (Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 47.) In other words, the Commission did not argue that Cabinet\u2019s decisions on Levels Plans were discriminatory practices; rather the Commission argued that those decisions are irrelevant.\n[187] Although the Complainant did not allege the Levels Plans were a discriminatory practice, he said that even if Cabinet sets the Levels Plan, it is not immunized from CHRA scrutiny:\n\u201cThe Respondent is wrong throughout its factum\u2014fervently and tiresomely wrong\u2014that there is something special in this case about Cabinet laying the Levels Plan. Not only is that contrary to binding precedent (Vaziri) but it posits a nonexistent, unreviewable Royal Prerogative, and ignores that Parliament\u2019s law is supreme\u2014including the CHRA. From Mr. Stynes\u2019 broken-record objections of \u201cCabinet confidence!\u201d during Mr. Bornais\u2019 cross-examination to its factum now, the Respondent hurls the word \u201cCabinet\u201d about as if it were a magical hex to throw sand in the Tribunal\u2019s eyes and elevate government above human rights review. It is total\u2014and arguably totalitarian\u2014nonsense. Even Cabinet decisions are reviewable for legality\u2014period, no exceptions. (\u2026) if a Cabinet decision is subject to judicial review under the common law, then how could it possibly be immune from Tribunal review under the quasi-constitutional CHRA?\u201d (Complainant\u2019s Reply Factum, paras. 8-9. Emphasis in original.)\n[188] Although the above submission sounds like a challenge to Cabinet setting the Levels Plan, I accept the Complainant\u2019s earlier submission that setting the Levels Plan is not challenged as a service under the CHRA.\na) Are the Levels Plans Binding?\n[189] Consistent with his approach of focusing on the discretion of the Minister and IRCC, Dr. Attaran makes lengthy argument that the Levels Plans were not legally binding and that public servants were not bound to follow them (para. 43 of Reply Factum.) His final submissions also cite extensive evidence that the Levels Plans were not strictly followed, and that there were numerous occasions when the target ranges set out in the Levels Plans had been missed. (Complainant Factum paras. 51-57.) He concludes that this is proof that the discretion to admit more than the Levels Plan was always there. He concludes:\n\u201cTo sum up: the Respondent\u2019s framing of this case \u2013 as if it were a legal challenge to Cabinet\u2019s Levels Plan, and as if the Levels Plan binds and straightjackets IRCC utterly, inexorably leading to PGP backlogs and long wait times \u2013 is richly embroidered nonsense.\u201d (Para 135 Complainant\u2019s Factum.)\n[190] The Commission agrees that the Levels Plan is one of the controls used to manage intake and concedes that the Levels Plan has many moving parts to it. (Commission Reply Factum at para. 27.) They argue that the implementation of the Levels Plan is where discretion is used and, therefore, where the CHRT has jurisdiction. (Para. 6 of Commission\u2019s Factum.) They argue that IRCC is provided with wide discretion to manipulate the target ranges throughout the year and can effectively rewrite programs or create new ones. (Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 6.) In their words, \u201cIRCC can, among other things, borrow, swap, recalibrate, exceed and fall short\u201d. (Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 37.)\n[191] The evidence provided through testimony showed that the IRCC Operations Planning and Performance Branch, which manages the implementation of the Levels Plan, uses the ranges set therein as targets to be met on an annual basis. As Mr. Tetford testified, his office reported weekly on their progress towards reaching those annual target ranges. Overseas offices were also allotted targets to meet. (Cross-examination of Mr. Tetford on Feb. 9, 2021 @ 3:28:45.) It is not disputed by the Commission, based on the documentary evidence, that IRCC usually stays within the set target ranges. (Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 37.) However, their argument highlights years where IRCC fell short or exceeded target ranges particularly within the PGP category (Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 39.)\n[192] The evidence at the hearing was clear that in all years, admission targets for PGPs were set in the Levels Plans at levels far below the actual demand (where demand is the number of people seeking to sponsor a parent or grandparent). By contrast, the admission targets for spouses and minor children in the Levels Plan were set high enough with the intention to absorb all of the applications submitted so that no backlog would accumulate. With respect to those FC1 applications, Mr. Bornais testified that, \u201clevels were set to correspond as much as possible with forecast demand, and that\u2019s in contrast to most programs where the Department tries to set up demand application intake in accordance with supply in the levels space.\u201d (Direct Examination on February 10, 2021 at 48:45.)\n[193] Mr. Tetford explained that from July 2009 until the spring of 2012, Dr. Attaran\u2019s sponsorship application was essentially \u201csitting on a shelf\u201d waiting for its turn to be processed when it came up through the queue. Mr. Tetford testified that each year he would be provided with the target set out in the Levels Plan and he would allocate resources accordingly to try to meet that target. Applications like Dr. Attaran\u2019s would sit on a shelf as Inventory until it was time to process it in order to meet the target in the Levels Plan. Applications were processed in chronological order based on when they were received, on a \u201cfirst in - first out\u201d basis. Mr. Tetford testified that applicant requests to \u201cexpedite\u201d processing, like the request Dr. Kazem Attaran made in his letter dated May 8, 2012 (Exhibit 3, page 51) would likely have little impact. He said that most everyone had a reason why they wanted their application to be processed sooner. If they responded to every request, it wouldn\u2019t be fair. As such, they adhered to the first in \u2013 first out principle. (Commission\u2019s cross-examination of Mr. Tetford on February 9, 2021 starting at @ 3:31.)\n[194] Looking at the whole of the evidence, there were reasonable explanations provided as to why deviations from the Levels Plan target ranges occurred. Mr. Cardinal clarified that reaching target ranges is not a hard science. He explained the numerous challenges encountered when carrying through and implementing the Levels Plan. Permanent residence applications are processed and visas issued at numerous offices in Canada and throughout the world. Operational challenges include variables outside of IRCC control, namely, visa wastage (when a person does not choose to use a visa they are issued), landing lag (landing in the calendar year after visa issuance), seasonality and travelling with dependent children who might have to wait until the end of school before travelling. (Respondent\u2019s Factum at para. 94.)\n[195] The degree of these deviations was highlighted in the Minister\u2019s 2008 annual report to Parliament (Exhibit 21) on page 5. In 2007, the overall target range for new immigrants was 240,000 to 265,000. Over 250,000 visas were issued but there were only 236,758 admissions in that year. In other words, over 13,000 permanent resident visas issued, representing more than 5% of the total, were not used in that calendar year.\n[196] Devoting appropriate resources is also a challenge. The same IRCC employees who process PGP applications overseas also have to cope with peak seasonal demands for visitor and student visa processing. (Cross-examination of Mr. Cardinal on September 23, 2021 @ 1:03:50.) Mr. Bornais testified that deviations occur as a result of these multiple moving parts, but that IRCC nevertheless makes every effort to reach the target range in the Levels Plan. In other words, there are practical realities that make reaching target ranges difficult. (Respondent\u2019s Factum, par. 99; Cross Examination of Glen Bornais on February 12 at 1:57:20.) I accept Mr. Cardinal\u2019s and Mr. Bornais\u2019 testimony on these points as credible and compelling.\n[197] Regarding the Commission\u2019s argument that the Levels Plans were not really binding, and that discretion existed to depart from them, I am guided by the evidence of Mr. Tetford who spoke to Exhibit 18, the policy document drafted by Tracey Bender. At page 18, the author gives perspective on the number of applications arriving at CPC-M at a time when the Respondent could not refuse acceptance of applications that were coming in, indicating that the change in levels would have to have been extreme to keep up with demand, to a degree not consistent with competing immigration goals that the IRCC is tasked to implement:\nLevels management could never have prevented the inventories from accumulating both in Canada and abroad. In 2002, over 22,000 parents and grandparents became permanent residents. The inventory that same year was 48,460 people, which meant that the processing time was just over two years. In 2003 however, the number of PGPs accepted as permanent residents stayed relatively constant at 19,394, but the inventory grew by over 25,000 people for a new total of over roughly 73,649 person applications waiting to be processed. Since 2004, the inventory has been over 100,000 people.\nTo maintain the inventory at the 2002 level of 48,460 people- over 44,000 people (or an additional 25,000 people) would needed to have become permanent residents in 2003; over 69,000 people (or an additional 56,000 people) in 2004; over 71,000 (an additional 59,000) in 2005; and over 79,000 people (or over 59,000 extra) in 2006- simply to maintain the 2002 inventory!\nWhat is clear from this chart (not pictured) is that the inventory could not have been prevented operationally by adjusting the 60\/40 split and simply increasing the number of parents and grandparents that became permanent residents. Since the level of intake of applications (in persons) each year since 2002 was nearly as high as the 2002 inventory level- 48,460, preventing the inventory from accumulating could never have been possible through levels management alone.\n[198] The 60\/40 split referred to the overarching goal of the government to admit approximately 60% of total immigrants in the economic classes and the remaining 40% to be admitted as refugees and Family Class members. (See paragraph 86 of the David Manicom Affidavit, Exhibit 16.)\n[199] Mr. Cardinal gave evidence that confirmed the magnitude of the problem. He said that in 2011, even if the target ranges for PGP admissions were increased by 4,000-5,000 spaces per year, it would not have any effect on the then-40 month estimated processing time. (Redirect Examination of Mr. Cardinal on September 24, 2021 @ 3:08:40.)\n[200] As the Respondent noted, the extent of the PGP backlog in 2011 was so high that processing times could only have been resolved by Levels Plan changes so drastic that they would have upset the balancing of the other immigration streams (such as economic and refugee classes) as decided by Cabinet. It would have required a tripling or quadrupling of PGP admission levels to bring the inventory down in a matter of two to three years. (See Respondent\u2019s Factum at para. 276.)\n[201] There was no evidence that IRCC had the authority to unilaterally rewrite, swap or create new programs. While the evidence showed that the Levels Plan targets were often missed for the reasons above, there was also evidence they were departed from because of periodic Ministerial commitments (cross-examination of Simon Cardinal on September 23, 2021 @ 1:01:54). For example, in 2015, Protected Persons and Refugees exceeded the target range by over 6,000 due to the commitment of the new government to resettle a high number of Syrian refugees (see Exhibit 28 and the Respondent\u2019s Factum at para. 105.)\n[202] There was no evidence to suggest that IRCC had the discretion to increase the PGP numbers on its own volition, and certainly not on such a massive scale. The actual demand for PGP admission spaces has always been very high, and permitting IRCC to exceed the targets sufficiently to meet all demand, would have resulted in a massive number of PGP admissions, making the Levels Plans meaningless.\n[203] I have found that Cabinet sets the Levels Plan. No party directed the Tribunal to explicit authority in IRPA or the IRPA Regulations for IRCC to deviate from the Levels Plans in a manner that defeats their intention and purpose. The regime contains elements of discretion that are designed to help the Minister accomplish the Levels Plan and implement IRPA, given the range of circumstances and exigencies that can arise. Those elements of discretion do not indicate that the Minister or IRCC should ignore the instructions of Cabinet.\n[204] Regarding the Complainant\u2019s argument that Cabinet decisions are not immune from CHRA scrutiny, or whether Parliament is supreme and Cabinet decisions may be judicially reviewed, these are not the issues here. The issue is whether IRCC had the discretion under IRPA to process applications in a manner that would undo the resulting differential treatment of PGPs expressed in Levels Plans.\n[205] The fact that Cabinet chose to limit admission spaces for PGPs, and chose to not set targets which match actual demand (as they do for spouses and children), those are decisions of Cabinet.\n[206] IRCC must implement Cabinet decisions. The limited flexibility that existed, or the fact that target ranges were sometimes missed, must not be conflated to be wide discretion allowing IRCC to ignore the targets in the Levels Plan and instead admit a massive number of PGPs to achieve parity with spouses and children.\nF. MINISTERIAL INSTRUCTIONS\na) Did the IRCC\u2019s Use of Ministerial Instructions involve the provision of a service?\n[207] In addition to IRPA, the IRPA Regulations and the Levels Plans, Ministerial Instructions guide IRCC officials for the intake and processing of PGP sponsorship applications. The Complainant and Commission allege that the Minister\u2019s non-use and use, respectively, of Ministerial Instructions were discriminatory practices. In response, the Respondent asserts that Ministerial Instructions are not a service.\n[208] The Complainant and Commission say that the power to use Ministerial Instructions is a discretionary policy-making tool and should be considered an element of IRCC\u2019s provision of service in processing applications. The Respondent argues that Ministerial Instructions do not meet the definition of service in Watkin. Is the creation of a Ministerial Instruction by the Minister a service, or does it lack the hallmarks of a service?\n[209] It is worthwhile to examine the language in s. 87.3 of IRPA which authorizes the Minister to create Ministerial Instructions:\nApplication\n87.3 (1) This section applies to applications for visas or other documents made under subsections 11(1) and (1.01), other than those made by persons referred to in subsection 99(2), to sponsorship applications made under subsection 13(1), to applications for permanent resident status under subsection 21(1) or temporary resident status under subsection 22(1) made by foreign nationals in Canada, to applications for work or study permits and to requests under subsection 25(1) made by foreign nationals outside Canada.\nAttainment of immigration goals\n(2) The processing of applications and requests is to be conducted in a manner that, in the opinion of the Minister, will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada.\nInstructions\n(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the Minister may give instructions with respect to the processing of applications and requests, including instructions\n(a) establishing categories of applications or requests to which the instructions apply;\n(a.1) establishing conditions, by category or otherwise, that must be met before or during the processing of an application or request;\n(b) establishing an order, by category or otherwise, for the processing of applications or requests;\n(c) setting the number of applications or requests, by category or otherwise, to be processed in any year; and\n(d) providing for the disposition of applications and requests, including those made subsequent to the first application or request.\nApplication\n(3.1) An instruction may, if it so provides, apply in respect of pending applications or requests that are made before the day on which the instruction takes effect.\nClarification\n(3.2) For greater certainty, an instruction given under paragraph (3)(c) may provide that the number of applications or requests, by category or otherwise, to be processed in any year be set at zero.\nCompliance with instructions\n(4) Officers and persons authorized to exercise the powers of the Minister under section 25 shall comply with any instructions before processing an application or request or when processing one. If an application or request is not processed, it may be retained, returned or otherwise disposed of in accordance with the instructions of the Minister.\nClarification\n(5) The fact that an application or request is retained, returned or otherwise disposed of does not constitute a decision not to issue the visa or other document, or grant the status or exemption, in relation to which the application or request is made.\nPublication\n(6) Instructions shall be published in the Canada Gazette.\nClarification\n(7) Nothing in this section in any way limits the power of the Minister to otherwise determine the most efficient manner in which to administer this Act.\n[210] The introduction of Ministerial Instructions was explained by legal expert, Mario Bellissimo in a document referenced by the Commission in its Factum at para. 40:\nBy 2008, the Canadian Federal Skilled Worker (\u201cFSW\u201d) program was facing a tremendous backlog. The number of applicants consistently exceeded program capacity by large measure, and in 2008, over 600,000 applicants were awaiting processing while this number continued to swell. This backlog led to an extreme delay between the time of applying and time of processing. Applicants put their lives on hold for years while awaiting a decision, and it became increasingly difficult to match applicants\u2019 skills with current Canadian labour market needs. Despite enormous delays, the backlog continued to expand.\nIn response, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (\u201cIPRA\u201d) was amended and section 87.3 was created. This provision granted the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (currently Minister Jason Kenney) broad authority to set processing quotas and priorities for different classes of applications in a given year by way of \u201cMinisterial Instructions,\u201d and summarily dispose of those that did not meet these criteria. (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, section 87.3(3) [in force from 18 June 2008 until 28 June 2012], section 3.) It also deemed that any action performed pursuant to these Ministerial Instructions did \u201cnot constitute a decision not to issue the visa or other document, or grant the status or exemption,\u201d (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c.27, section 87.3(5)) thereby attempting to insulate these decisions from judicial review in the Federal Court of Canada. (Emphasis added.)\n[211] According to Mr. Bellissimo, Ministerial Instructions were the new tool used to perform actions that would not be attacked on judicial review as a decision denying a visa or document or granting a status or exemption.\n[212] Moreover, s. 5(2) of IRPA requires the Minister to table in each House of Parliament, for referral to the appropriate committee of each House, any proposed regulation affecting the most important sections for admission to Canada. The use of Ministerial Instructions by the Minister, to impose important conditions and limits on immigration criteria, avoids the scrutiny of Houses of Parliament committees previously required when amendments were made by regulation.\n[213] The very first Ministerial Instruction, introduced as Exhibit 93, focussed on the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) backlog. It introduced new criteria for FSW applications received after February 29, 2008 that would be \u201cplaced into processing immediately upon receipt.\u201d The FSW applications received prior to that date were therefore deprioritized. This marked the departure of the \u201cfirst in-first out\u201d rule for deciding an application in the order in which it was received. This was a significant change affecting hundreds of thousands of people in the FSW queue who lost their priority in that queue. That group, who applied prior to February 27, 2008, mostly had their applications languish until they were \u201cterminated\u201d by amendments to IRPA in 2012. The new amendment, s. 87(4) of IRPA, included subsection (3) deeming the termination to not constitute a decision to issue a permanent resident visa (insulation from judicial review according to Mr. Bellissimo) and sub-section (5) precluding any right of recourse or indemnity against the Government for the termination of their applications, which at this point had been languishing for at least four years, but in the majority of cases, much longer.\n[214] Subsequent Ministerial Instructions submitted into evidence revealed that they were used for a variety of purposes to fine tune selection criteria and to impose limits on numbers of applications that would be received in various categories, including PGPs. They also made provisions for applications in certain categories that would simply \u201cnot be processed.\u201d (See Exhibit 93 for example.)\n[215] There were eight Ministerial Instructions impacting PGP sponsorship applications submitted into evidence. Only Ministerial Instruction #4 was issued during the time-frame of Dr. Attaran\u2019s application. Issued in late 2011, it imposed a temporary moratorium on the intake of new sponsorship applications, but this did not affect the Complainant. The subsequent Ministerial Instructions, issued from 2014 to 2020, imposed intake caps for sponsorships and different methods for selection for such applications. In some years, there would be a short time-frame for application submission. In other years, there was a randomized selection. These later Ministerial Instructions did not impact the Complainant or others like him seeking to sponsor parents or grandparents at that time.\n[216] The Complainant frames the issue as when using his discretion, did the Minister differentiate adversely (Reply Factum at para 65.) The Commission describes Ministerial Instructions as an innovative form of law-making which allow wide discretion to revamp policy and criteria (CHRC Factum at paras 40 & 45.)\n[217] The Respondent\u2019s position is that policy measures needed to permit intake control cannot be characterized as a \u201cservice\u201d because they lack the transitive connotation required of a service as described by the Supreme Court of Canada in Gould. Moreover, Ministerial Instructions do not resemble \u2018goods\u2026 facilities or accommodations\u2019. There isn\u2019t a public interface with the alleged service provider. There is no ability nor requirement to \u2018accommodate\u2019 individual circumstances. (Respondent\u2019s Factum at paras. 208 and 194.)\n[218] It is clear that Ministerial Instructions are not decisions of Cabinet. Ministerial Instructions are distinct from Cabinet decisions as they are a result of the opinion of the Minister. Subsection 87.3(2) of IRPA makes it clear that in granting authority to the Minister to make Ministerial Instructions, the authority must be exercised in a particular manner: \u201cThe processing of applications and requests is to be conducted in a manner that, in the opinion of the Minister, will best support the attainment of the immigration goals established by the Government of Canada.\u201d The section does not grant the Minister authority to set immigration goals contrary to those set by Parliament and Cabinet.\n[219] The preponderance of evidence in this case is that the Minister in making Ministerial Instructions was attempting to implement \u201cthe immigration goals established by the Government of Canada\u201d, as required by s.87.3(2) of IRPA. The combination of high demand for sponsorship of PGPs and relatively low target ranges in the Levels Plans meant IRCC had great difficulty with Backlogs on the one hand, and the dissatisfaction of potential applicants who were excluded by intake controls on the other.\n[220] When Ministerial Instructions were finally implemented in 2011 to deal with PGPs, the Minister treated the PGP applicants differently than other categories, but this was inevitable to implement the goals in the Levels Plans, IRPA and the IRPA Regulations. With the exception of Ministerial Instruction #4, the later Ministerial Instructions are far removed from the time-frame of Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint and did not impact him or others like him making applications at that time.\n[221] In my view, Ministerial Instructions are not a service under the CHRA. They lack the transitive connotation required. There is not an interface between the public and the Minister (Gould, supra at para. 55.) Not every action of the Government is a service (Watkin, supra, at para. 33.)\n[222] Having come to this conclusion, I now address the specific arguments of the Complainant and the Commission.\nb) Non-Deployment of Ministerial Instructions from 2008-2011 to Control Intake of Applications to Prevent Backlog Growth\n[223] Dr. Attaran alleges that the non-deployment of Ministerial Instructions from 2008-2011 to control intake of PGP applications was adverse differential treatment because, in his view, this would have reduced the growth of the Backlog of applications during that period.\n[224] At the time Dr. Attaran submitted his sponsorship application, CPC-Mississauga would only draw from Inventory, on a first in \u2013 first out basis, a limited number of applications sufficient enough to fill the spaces allocated in the Levels Plan for the PGP subgroup in that year. However, at the same time, there was no intake control. The number of new applications that arrived each year far exceeded the number of spaces allocated in the Levels Plan. This resulted in a growing Backlog of cases.\n[225] IRCC did not implement intake controls for applications until the amendment to IRPA in 2008 afforded the Minister the power to issue Ministerial Instructions. As Mr. Cardinal testified, the Minister\u2019s initial use of Ministerial Instructions was to control intake and to dispense with the Backlog in the Federal Skilled Worker category in 2008.\n[226] The Minister did not invoke this power with respect to PGP applications until 2011 when Ministerial Instruction #4 was implemented to bring in a pause in the acceptance of new PGP sponsorship applications from November 2011 to the end of 2013. As noted above, in the ensuing years, there were a number of subsequent Ministerial Instructions used to control the intake of new PGP sponsorship applications, including a lottery.\n[227] Dr. Attaran argues that the Respondent could have earlier: (i) paused the intake of new applications; (ii) placed a limit or \u201ccap\u201d on the number of applications that it accepts for intake; (iii) issued a limited number of invitations to apply; and \/ or (iv) run a randomized selection or lottery to select a pool of applications. Dr. Attaran cited Exhibit 65 to show these options had been under consideration by the Respondent.\n[228] Dr. Attaran acknowledges that eventually, the Respondent did implement a pause and the other suggested methods to control the intake of applications. However, these measures were only undertaken after he had submitted his application to sponsor his parents and it joined the existing queue at CPC-Mississauga.\n[229] Dr. Attaran alleges that the Respondent should have used these intake control measures earlier to reduce the total processing time for his application, and that by not doing so, he and his family were subjected to adverse differential treatment as compared to spouses and partners (for whom demand and supply were reasonably matched) and other categories of immigrants who had intake controls sooner (eg. Foreign Skilled Workers in 2008). (Paras 122 and 143 of Complainant\u2019s Factum.)\n[230] Dr. Attaran did not suggest what specific Ministerial Instruction could have been implemented in 2008 which would have benefitted him specifically and would not itself have been discriminatory. It is true that Ministerial Instructions related to PGPs could have been implemented sooner, as early as 2008. However, if there had been some earlier intake control to his benefit, it would seem to come at the expense of excluding other potential applicants.\n[231] The Respondent points out that if the Ministerial Instructions were implemented in 2008 for intake controls for PGP applicants, Dr. Attaran may have faced measures such as a moratorium and then not been able to submit an application for sponsorship at all. (Respondent\u2019s Factum at para. 206.) Dr. Attaran calls this argument a factual fabrication and suggests the Respondent \u201cwildly speculates\u201d in making it without citing any evidence. (See Para. 80 of Complainant\u2019s Reply Factum.)\n[232] The evidence showed the first Ministerial Instruction to address PGP Intake, Ministerial Instruction #4 dated November 5, 2011, implemented a moratorium on the intake of new PGP sponsorship applications that lasted for 26 months. If intake controls had been in place earlier, those intake controls would have prevented some of the people seeking to apply between 2008-2011 from doing so. That is the meaning and purpose of \u201cintake control\u201d, and it is what happened after 2011. Dr. Attaran\u2019s argument assumes that his application would, nevertheless, have been one of the ones accepted into the inventory.\n[233] The argument for earlier intake controls through Ministerial Instructions also ignores the \u201celephant in the room.\u201d Any form of intake control, when compared to the on-demand intake of the FC1 Family Class members, represents differential treatment of PGPs.\nc) Aggressive Ministerial Instructions (e.g. Caps, Moratoriums and Lotteries) are used for PGPs but not for Spouses and Children\n[234] The Commission alleged a second form of inappropriate use of Ministerial Instructions. Whereas Dr. Attaran made the argument that the Respondent could have implemented Ministerial Instructions sooner to limit the intake of PGP sponsorship applications, the Commission submitted that the Minister\u2019s aggressive use of Ministerial Instructions to control intake for PGP applicants was adverse differential treatment.\n[235] Starting in November 2011, various Ministerial Instructions called for caps, moratoriums and even lotteries for PGP applicants, but not for spouses and children. For example, Ministerial Instruction #4 brought in the 26-month intake moratorium in 2011. Ministerial Instruction #9 set an intake cap for PGP sponsorship applications in 2014 at 5,000. Ministerial Instruction #21 set an intake cap for 2017 at 10,000. Ministerial Instruction #25 introduced a system of randomized selection and set the cap for 2018 at 10,000. Ministerial Instruction #43 introduced a short window of time in 2020 when potential sponsors could submit an interest to sponsor, which if selected, would lead to an invitation to submit an application. It also set the intake cap for 2021 at 10,000.\n[236] The Commission makes the observation that several memoranda to the IRCC Minister made exhibits at the hearing suggested the use of certain tools to recalibrate the number of applications in the Backlog relative to the supply of admissions spaces in Levels Plans for PGP applications. The memoranda refer to tools such as temporary pauses, first-in intake with a narrow time-limited opening, randomized selections, moratoriums and caps. However, the Commission notes that nowhere in the record does it show that the Respondent used such \u201caggressive tools\u201d for the calibration of application numbers for spouses and minor children (Commission\u2019s Factum at para. 91.) They refer to the testimony of Mr. Cardinal who confirmed that FC1s were not subjected to these tools for application intake control because the levels of intake demand were consistently aligned with the Levels Plan. (Para. 91 of the Commission\u2019s Factum.) As noted above, Cabinet set the Levels Plan target ranges for permanent resident admissions in the FC1 subgroup in a manner that consistently aligned with the number of people actually seeking to be sponsored. As such, Backlogs were not an issue for FC1s.\n[237] The Commission suggests that the use of the Ministerial Instructions to manage application intake are \u201ccapricious solutions\u201d for the parent and grandparent backlogs that suggest differential treatment. The Commission argues there is no evidence that supports a reasonable explanation for the adverse differential treatment for PGPs caused by the use of Ministerial Instructions but not for FC1s. They argue that the Ministerial Instructions further marginalize the PGP category.\n[238] Echoing these arguments of the Commission, Dr. Attaran observes that no other members of the Family Class besides the PGPs \u201csuffered the indignity of a lottery.\u201d (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 160.)\n[239] For the Commission, the discretionary power afforded to the Minister under s.87.3 of IRPA is again distinguishable from Matson\/Andrews, where the processing department had no discretion to interpret the eligibility criteria differently. Using Ministerial instructions, the Minister has discretion in the implementation of policies and practices in delivering the immigration program (para. 20 of Commission\u2019s Reply Factum.)\n[240] The Complainant and Commission have both argued issuing Ministerial Instructions is akin to the facts in the Tribunal\u2019s case of Beattie v Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada, 2014 CHRT 1 (Beattie). In Beattie, the Respondent, while processing an application for Indian status, had an interpretation available to it that did not differentiate on a prohibited ground.\n[241] In Beattie, the non-discriminatory option that lay within the scope of the official\u2019s discretion had been identified. The official\u2019s interpretation of the Indian Act contributed to the adverse differentiation experienced by the complainant, whereas in Matson\/Andrews, the official had no choice because the source of the adverse differentiation was entirely attributable to the eligibility criteria in the Indian Act.\n[242] In Beattie, the Tribunal found that a representative of the government did not exercise their discretion in a manner consistent with the CHRA. In this complaint, the allegation is that the Minister himself did not exercise discretion, in the exercise of articulating his opinion on best how to carry out the objectives of Cabinet through Ministerial Instructions, in a manner consistent with the CHRA.\nd) The Minister\u2019s non-use and use of Ministerial Instructions after 2008: analysis of alleged adverse differential treatment\n[243] Starting with the Respondent\u2019s position on the alleged inappropriate use of Ministerial Instructions and failure to implement intake controls before 2008, the Respondent argues that prior to the 2008 amendment to IRPA granting authority for Ministerial Instructions, the Minister did not have the discretion to stop or limit the intake of new applications without the intervention of Parliament or the Cabinet.\n[244] The Complainant retorts that the Respondent\u2019s argument \u201cis a brazen lie\u201d and that the original version of IRPA passed in 2001 at s. 14(2) allowed regulations to govern the number of applications in a year (Complainant\u2019s Reply Factum at paras. 51-52.) He argues that amendments to regulations could have implemented intake control measures such as lotteries, moratoriums and caps. The Respondent clarifies in its Sur-Reply (at para. 12) that the IRPA amendments in 2008 gave the Minister the power, for the first time, to control intake.\n[245] The parties are not arguing the same point here. The evidence showed the Government did use regulation to reduce PGP intake in 2014 by implementing Regulation 133(1)(j)(i)(B) to increase the minimum required sponsor income by 30%. Dr. Attaran is correct that s.14(2) of IRPA does provide that the IRPA Regulations may include provisions respecting the number of applications that may be processed or approved in a year. However, the Respondent is arguing that in the absence of provisions in IRPA or a regulation, IRCC had no authority to refuse to accept applications for sponsorship at the point of intake until Ministerial Instructions came into play in 2008. As already discussed, regulation-making is not the service before the Tribunal in this complaint. The focus needs to remain on the powers the Minister had under s. 87.3 of IRPA, and whether those were exercised appropriately.\n[246] Ministerial Instructions involve implementation of processes to best achieve the immigration goals of Canada, which are expressed in IRPA, the IRPA Regulations and the Levels Plans as set by Cabinet. The language in the statute (s.87.3) is clear that the Minister is given wide discretion to determine the most efficient manner in which to administer IRPA (sub-section (7).) Subsection (2) clarifies that Ministerial Instructions reflect the opinion of the Minister on how to support the immigration goals of the Government, which include those goals reflected in IRPA, the IRPA Regulation, and decisions of Cabinet on target ranges for categories of applicants as expressed in Levels Plans.\n[247] However, the existence of discretion does not necessarily imply the existence of a service. For the reasons above, I have concluded that Ministerial Instructions are not a service. Dr. Attaran has not presented a convincing argument to demonstrate how an earlier use of intake controls through Ministerial Instructions would have benefited him or others like him seeking to sponsor parents and grandparents.\n[248] The post-2011 Ministerial Instructions which the Commission seeks to impugn cannot be properly included in this complaint. The later intake controls had no impact on Dr. Attaran\u2019s application or the others applying at the same time. While their submission into evidence gave context and insight to the use of the Ministerial Instructions, the post-2011 Ministerial Instructions impacted persons who were subjected to a new regime for PGP processing. That new regime included strict application intake controls which resulted in the elimination of the PGP Backlog and much faster processing for the cases accepted.\n[249] In conclusion, Ministerial Instructions are not services. Furthermore, the Complainant and the Commission have not convinced the Tribunal, on a balance of probabilities, that their earlier use would have ameliorated the wait time experienced by Dr. Attaran and his family. Therefore, these allegations are dismissed.\nXIV. Was the Minister\u2019s Failure to Use the Authority under section 25.2(1) of IRPA, to Exempt PGP Applicants from Certain Financial Requirements Set out in the Regulations, Adverse Differential Treatment in the Provision of a Service?\n[250] The Complainant and the Commission submitted that PGP sponsors are subjected to more onerous financial requirements than sponsors of other members of the Family Class. Dr. Attaran argues that the higher financial thresholds for PGP sponsorship are adverse differential treatment of those who wish to sponsor parents and grandparents because they make eligibility to become a sponsor more difficult. He then alleges that the Minister ought to have used his discretionary authority provided by s. 25.2(1) of IRPA, discussed below, to eliminate this differential treatment. The Minister\u2019s failure to use his discretionary power in this manner was, in Dr. Attaran\u2019s submission, a discriminatory practice.\n[251] Firstly, the Tribunal heard evidence that every Family Class sponsor must submit an Undertaking of Assistance as part of their sponsorship application. According to IRPA Regulation 132(1), \u201c\u2026the sponsor\u2019s undertaking obliges the sponsor to reimburse Her Majesty in Right of Canada or a province for every benefit provided as social assistance to or on behalf of the sponsored foreign national and their family members\u2026\u201d\n[252] The duration of the sponsor\u2019s Undertaking of Assistance is set out in R.132(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA Regulations and varies based on the type of applicant. The start date of the undertaking is defined in R.132(1)(a) as the date upon which the sponsored relative arrives in Canada on a temporary resident permit, obtains a temporary resident permit while in Canada, or becomes a permanent resident. End dates vary significantly based on the subcategory of immigrant. While FC1 sponsors are generally obliged under their undertaking for three years (IRPA Regulation 132(1)(b)(i)), PGP sponsors are obliged under their undertakings for much longer. At the time Dr. Attaran sponsored his parents, the Undertaking of Assistance that he signed obliged him for 10 years after his parents\u2019 arrival. However, the IRPA Regulations have since been amended to require PGP sponsors to sign undertakings that are valid for 20 years after their relatives\u2019 arrival in Canada: IRPA Regulation 132(1)(b)(iv). The length of undertaking for FC1 sponsors has not changed.\n[253] Sponsors of parents and grandparents also experience another, related financial requirement that is more rigorous than the requirements for sponsors of other Family Class members. All Family Class applications require the sponsor to provide financial information to demonstrate they are financially capable of fulfilling their obligations under the Undertaking of Assistance. Depending on the intended province of residence, the sponsor must demonstrate they (and their spouse, if applicable) have an income that meets or exceeds the low-income cut-off (LICO) amount for the size of family in that region.\n[254] In the 2011 CIC Executive Committee presentation dated June 30, 2011 (Exhibit 160) various options were explored to deal with the increasing intake of PGP applications. One policy option considered was to increase the LICO amount for sponsors. Preliminary data suggested that increasing the income requirement to 25% over the existing LICO would result in a 43% reduction in application intake. Increasing the requirement to 40% over LICO would result in a 57% reduction of PGP applications.\n[255] In 2014, the IRPA Regulations were amended such that R.133(1)(j)(i)(B) required PGP sponsors to have the minimum necessary income of the existing LICO plus 30% in order to be eligible. By contrast, under R.133(1)(j)(i)(A), FC1 sponsors are only required to show they have the minimum necessary income at the existing LICO level.\n[256] The source of the increased income requirement is clearly by way of the amended IRPA Regulations which came into force on January 1, 2014. The source of the more burdensome financial undertaking is also by way of the IPRA Regulations. The amendment increasing the PGP sponsors\u2019 undertaking from 10 years to 20 years also came into force on January 1, 2014.\n[257] The Respondent argues that the regulatory changes did not affect Dr. Attaran and the evidence showed he had no difficulty demonstrating the minimum necessary income required. The changes to the IRPA Regulations came into force after Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents had landed as permanent residents in Canada.\n[258] The Respondent also argues that Dr. Attaran\u2019s challenge to the duration of undertakings was not mentioned anywhere in his Statement of Particulars, nor was the challenge to the minimum income requirements. Furthermore, they argue the changes had no impact on wait times and are not engaged by the facts of this case. (Para. 214 of the Respondent\u2019s Factum.)\n[259] It may be true that these regulatory measures have adverse, differential effects on PGP sponsors. The additional 7-17 years of undertaking constitutes a larger financial risk to the sponsor and as such, it is adverse. It might also have the effect of discouraging some people from becoming sponsors.\n[260] Similarly, the minimum income requirement for PGP sponsors is more burdensome. The additional 30% requirement will undoubtedly eliminate the chances of some Canadians who wish to be sponsors of PGP relatives.\n[261] These regulatory requirements are unambiguous. The new financial requirements make sponsorship more difficult for some prospective sponsors. However, the Complainant and Commission have not established how the passage of these regulations involved the \u201cin the provision of a\u2026 service\u201d, as required by s.5 of the CHRA. The Complainant and Commission have stated that regulation-making is not the impugned service in this complaint. As such, these reasons do not make a determination on whether creating or amending the IRPA Regulations is itself a service.\n[262] Instead, the discriminatory practice alleged by Dr. Attaran is the Minister\u2019s failure to use the authority under section 25.2(1) to exempt PGP applicants from the financial requirements set out in these regulations.\n[263] Putting aside for a moment the Respondent\u2019s objection about relevance to the Complainant\u2019s own application, the Complainant and Commission have put two specific regulations about financial requirements in issue and say the Minister\u2019s failure to exempt all PGP applicants from these is systemic discrimination. Although not engaged by the Complainant\u2019s own application, these allegations relate to the experience of other PGP applicants at the IRCC.\n[264] Section 14 of IRPA states that the IRPA Regulations, may prescribe, and govern any matter relating to, classes of permanent residents or foreign nationals. Sub-section 14(2)(c) states that the IRPA Regulations may include provisions respecting:\n\u201cthe number of applications that may be processed or approved in a year, the number of visas and other documents that may be issued in a year, and the measures to be taken when that number is exceeded;\u201d\n[265] The Complainant argues that where the IRPA Regulations make a distinction on a prohibited ground, the responsible Minister has an obligation to use his or her discretion pursuant to section 25.2(1) to exempt applicants. The Complainant asserts that the CHRA requires this.\n[266] The Tribunal\u2019s case law in Beattie states that where government actors have discretion to interpret legislation in a way that avoids adverse differential treatment on a prohibited ground, the CHRA requires that they must exercise their discretion in a manner that does just that. In Beattie, a public servant chose to draw distinctions between biological children and custom-adopted children when interpreting provisions of the Indian Act (Beattie at para. 50). At para. 102 of his decision, Member Lustig found that \u201c(w)here a statute has ambiguous language that can be interpreted in more than one way, the CHRA requires that the administering department choose the interpretation that is most consistent with human rights law principles.\u201d\n[267] The Complainant relies on this principle to argue that the Minister is not strictly bound by R.132 and R.133 of the IRPA Regulations because s.25.2(1) of IRPA gives the Minister discretion to waive requirements in the IRPA Regulations (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 176.)\n[268] Subsection ss. 25.2(1) of IRPA reads as follows:\nPublic policy considerations\n25.2(1) The Minister may, in examining the circumstances concerning a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, grant that person permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations of this Act if the foreign national complies with any conditions imposed by the Minister and the Minister is of the opinion that it is justified by public policy considerations.\n[269] The Complainant refines this into two arguments. First, the IRCC\u2019s application of the financial undertaking and LICO requirements in the IRPA Regulations to PGP applicants does not attract the ratio in Matson\/Andrews because the Minister can use s.25.2(1) to make exemptions which, being discretionary acts, are necessarily a \u201cservice\u201d under the CHRA. Second, the Minister must use his\/her discretion to waive requirements in the IRPA Regulations that cause differential treatment to the PGP category because the CHRA takes precedence over the IRPA Regulations. The Complainant supports this argument by stating that the CHRA is Parliament\u2019s will, therefore the CHRA takes precedence over the IRPA Regulations to guide the Minister\u2019s exercise of discretion.\n[270] The Complainant submits that the Minister must exercise his discretion under IRPA to issue exemptions, and in this way, effectively bring the IRPA Regulations into what he perceives as conformity with the CHRA. Effectively, the submission is that the Minister should use sub-section 25.2(1) of IRPA to exempt all PGP applicants from any adverse differentiations within the Family Class that are rooted in the IRPA Regulations that result in systemic discrimination and admit PGP applicants in a manner reflecting equal prioritization with other Family Class applicants. (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 177.) In other words, the IRPA Regulations are not truly binding like most other laws because Parliament granted the Minister the ultimate discretion in IRPA s.25.2(1) to waive requirements under the regulations on public policy grounds (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 172.)\n[271] To support his position, the Complainant offered evidence from 2021 whereby the Minister exercised discretion under s.25.2(1) to temporarily exempt PGP sponsors from the elevated income requirements of the IRPA Regulations. (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 175.) (This policy change was in response to difficulties in meeting levels targets because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy change was not undertaken to exceed the levels targets set by Cabinet.)\n[272] The Minister\u2019s use of s.25.2(1) to exempt the entire pool of PGP sponsors from the usual income requirements appears to be a departure from the ordinary use of this regulation to grant exemptions for individuals. On its plain reading, it is not obvious that s.25.2(1) was intended to dispense with binding IRPA Regulations, particularly in a manner that would imply exercising Ministerial discretion to overturn regulations for entire categories of people or the Levels Plans and their prioritization of categories of immigrants. Here is the relevant part:\nss. 25.2(1) \u201cThe Minister may, in examining the circumstances concerning a foreign national who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of this Act, grant that person permanent resident status or an exemption\u2026\u201d (Underlining added.)\n[273] Nevertheless, the evidence was that the Minister relied on this discretionary provision in 2021 to exempt an entire category of persons from the income requirement of the IRPA Regulations and the Complainant now suggests that it could have been used similarly in the past to bring any offending regulations in line with the CHRA.\n[274] While arguing the Tribunal should make a finding on adverse differential impacts based on the Minister\u2019s failure to exercise discretion under s.25.2(1) to overturn regulations, it is important to recall that the Complainant also submitted that the Tribunal \u201cneed not, and should not\u201d decide whether the IRPA Regulations are immunized under the ratio in Matson\/Andrews (Complainant\u2019s Factum at para. 171, underlining in original.)\n[275] In addressing the IRPA Regulations, the Respondent argues that challenges to IRPA Regulations do not engage a service. Beyond arguments previously canvassed, the Respondent relies on conclusions in Murphy FCA where challenges to both the Unemployment Insurance Act and the Unemployment Insurance Regulations were found to be outside the scope of the CHRA. In short, they argue that regulations are subordinate law that attract the ratio in Matson\/Andrews. In Matson\/Andrews, the Supreme Court did not decide whether regulations are subject to scrutiny under the CHRA. As already set out in these reasons above, regulations are not the service the Complainant and Commission asked the Tribunal to inquiry into, and they did not present a case that regulations are a service.\n[276] Read in context, the discretion afforded to the Minister in s.25.2(1) is intended to enable the Minister to make exceptions, from time to time, to permit the admission of individuals who may be inadmissible or otherwise fall short of the normal immigration requirements. As the Complainant demonstrated, in 2021, this discretion was also used to exempt all potential PGP sponsors from the income regulation to enable the IRCC to meet Levels Plan target ranges. It would be inappropriate to interpret this use of the exemption as a reason to find s.25.2(1) gives the Minister discretion to render any regulation inoperable that creates an adverse differential effect in which a prohibited ground is a factor. This is a disguised attack on the government\u2019s power to make regulations that have that type of effect. Because the Complainant and Commission did not ask the Tribunal to rule on whether regulation-making is a service, and did not present argument and evidence going to that service, I decline to determine that question.\n[277] The scope of the Minister\u2019s discretion is narrower. The Minister can, exceptionally, make exemptions \u2013 and did, on the evidence. But the discretion to make exemptions is constrained by the statutory and regulatory regime, including Levels Plans. To the extent the Complainant\u2019s and Commission\u2019s arguments would, implicitly, overturn regulations or Levels Plan ranges, they are a disguised attack on those government activities, which the Complainant and Commission have not alleged to be nor demonstrated to be services under the CHRA.\n[278] The fact that IRPA and the IPRA Regulations make distinctions on prohibited grounds has been repeatedly noted and upheld in Canadian law. Immigration law is by its very nature exclusionary (Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2015 SCC 61 at para. 14.) It dictates who is permitted, or not permitted, to enter our country, whether permanently or for a temporary purpose.\n[279] As described above, the framework of IRPA is such that the statute is only an outline of the main structure of the program. The actual details about who gets admitted into Canada as a permanent resident is subordinated to the IRPA Regulations.\n[280] It has been a very long-standing factor in the IRPA Regulations, since their beginning, that certain potential immigrants are assessed on their age. IRPA Regulation 81 sets out the different points awarded to skilled worker applicants based on their age. The different age points for self-employed immigrant applicants are set out in IRPA Regulation 102.1. Age is a prohibited ground of discrimination under s.3(1) of the CHRA.\n[281] IRPA Regulation 7(1) states that a foreign national may not enter Canada to remain on a temporary basis without first obtaining a temporary resident visa. However, there is an exemption for certain individuals, based on their citizenship (which in most cases implies national origin) set out in IRPA Regulation 190(1). Those foreign nationals who are citizens of countries listed in that regulation or listed in Schedule 1.1 of the IRPA Regulations are exempt from the requirement to obtain a temporary resident visa to visit Canada. National origin is a prohibited ground of discrimination under s.3(1) of the CHRA.\n[282] The Minister has not chosen to use discretion under s.25.2(1) of IRPA to remove distinctions on prohibited grounds generally in the IRPA Regulations. If the Tribunal were to find that by not using a Ministerial exemption, to make IRPA Regulation 132(1) (regarding length of Undertakings) and the IRPA Regulation 133(1)(j)(i)(B) (increased LICO) irrelevant, it offended the CHRA, then this result would appear to suggest the Minister would be similarly obligated to make categorical exemptions relating to IRPA Regulations 81, 102.1, 190(1) and perhaps others as well. Surely this could not have been the intention of Parliament all along in the way IRPA and the IRPA Regulations were drafted, separating the framework from the detailed requirements. Immigration law is by its nature exclusionary and IRPA and the IRPA Regulations make distinctions sometimes based on prohibited grounds.\n[283] Consequently, the Complainant\u2019s argument that the Minister should have used discretion under s.25.2(1) of IRPA to bring regulations into \u201ccompliance\u201d with the CHRA must fail as an attack on the regulations themselves. The Complainant and Commission did not establish that regulation-making is a service, and did not ask the Tribunal to determine that question.\n[284] Moreover, I agree with the Respondent that Dr. Attaran\u2019s challenge to this IRPA Regulation was not mentioned anywhere in his Statement of Particulars. It did not preclude him from applying and the difference was not related to the wait times he experienced. The issue is not engaged by the facts of his case.\n[285] This allegation of a discriminatory practice is dismissed.\nXV. Whether IRCC engaged in any other of the alleged discriminatory practices when processing applications in the PGP category\n[286] As described earlier, in his original complaint to the Commission (Exhibit 1), Dr. Attaran described the \u201cbasic problem\u201d as the time taken by CIC to process the in-Canada portion of the sponsorship application for PGP\u2019s. He contrasted the estimates for processing times on the Respondent\u2019s website at the time: Adopted children \/ orphans - daily; PGPs \u2013 37 months; and spouses, partners and dependent children (FC1s) \u2013 42 days.\n[287] The Factum of the CHRC asserts that the adverse differential treatment is \u201cIRCC\u2019s practice of processing parents and grandparents\u2019 applications for permanent residence at a much slower rate\u2026\u201d (at para. 7). \u201cThis complaint is about the adverse treatment of Dr. Attaran and his parents experienced by the lengthy processing times when Dr. Attaran applied to sponsor his parents\u2026\u201d (Ibid at para. 33.) The Commission says that the service offered by IRCC was \u201capplication processing\u201d which started when it was \u201caccessed\u201d by the Attaran family by the submission of the application in 2009. They then waited \u201cfor more than three years for IRCC to confer the benefit.\u201d (Para. 26 of the CHRC Sur-Sur Reply.)\n[288] As outlined above, after the updated application documents were provided to CPC-M, the Part 1 of Dr. Attaran\u2019s sponsorship application was approved on May 28, 2012, only 19 days later. The entire application was finalized on December 13, 2012, when permanent residence visas were issued to Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents. The Complainant himself underscores at paragraph 38 of his Factum that the Application Review Wait Time of 9 months was less than IRCC\u2019s current service standard (12 months) for spouses, partners, and dependent children.\n[289] These facts support the interpretation that Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint must be about the entire time it took to process his complaint, from the IRCC\u2019s receipt of it on July 8, 2009 until December 13, 2012 (when the visas were issued.) If the complaint were only about the time in which it took to actively evaluate Part 1, it would have been about a processing time of only 19 days. That is less than half the stated processing time (42 days) for FC1 applications, to which Dr. Attaran compared his own application. If the complaint is only about the time it took to actively evaluate Part 1 and Part 2, from March 30, 2012, until December 13, 2012, (which included the time it took for Dr. Attaran and his parents to submit further documents, medical examination results and police certificates) it was less than nine months. In either case, there would have been no demonstrable adverse differential treatment upon which the Commission would have found the complaint to warrant referral to the Tribunal.\n[290] It is important to note this distinction because some of the final arguments of the Complainant and the Commission do not make the proper distinction between \u201cProcessing Time\u201d and \u201cApplication Review Wait Time\u201d as those terms are defined above. Being clear about the distinction makes it possible to make findings about what elements of the delays experienced by PGP applicants may be attributable to the combined effects of IRPA, the IRPA Regulations, the Levels Plans, Ministerial Instructions, and in turn, the IRCC\u2019s processing of applications in accordance with IRPA, the IRPA Regulations, Levels Plans and Ministerial Instructions.\n[291] Processing Time includes the \u201csitting on the shelf\u201d period for applications in the Backlog. The adverse differential treatment allegation about processing PGP applications more slowly must include this period because, in its absence, the Application Review Wait Time experienced by the Complainant did not result in longer wait times.\n[292] The Complainant and the Commission have argued that various different actions and inactions contributed to the longer processing times, including: streaming and prioritizing other applicant categories through simultaneous submission of applications for sponsorship and permanent residence; more favourable timing for requests for medical examinations; giving priority to so-called \u201cwild card\u201d relatives; the use of service standards for some categories but not PGPs; the suspension of PGP sponsorship applications at CPC-M in 2004-2005; and the deliberate shifting of resources away from PGPs in favour of FC1s. Each will be explored below.\nA. Simultaneous submissions of applications for sponsorship and permanent residence\n[293] Under the Family Class Re-Design Initiative of 2003-2004, FC1s were permitted to submit Part 2 of their applications along with the Part 1 sponsor\u2019s application. Evidence at the hearing concluded that in testing by CIC, by submitting both parts of the application at the beginning, FC1 processing times were reduced by over 50% for routine cases. The joint application kit for FC1s was introduced on June 28, 2002. (See Exhibit 63, at page 4.)\n[294] Dr. Attaran alleges that this differential treatment resulted in longer processing times for PGP (FC4) applicants like his parents. Their Part 2 application was not permitted to be submitted along with the Part 1 sponsorship. At the time he applied, his parents were required to wait for the approval of the Part 1 of the application before being invited to submit the Part 2. (However, this policy was changed shortly before the Attaran application was taken off the shelf.)\n[295] The streamlined processing, which allowed FC1s to submit both the Part 1 and Part 2 of their application at the same time, was originally not allowed for the PGP subgroup. However, immediately following Ministerial Instruction #4 which brought in the PGP application moratorium, IRCC issued Operations Bulletin 353 on November 7, 2011 (Exhibit #81.) This document confirms that as of July 18, 2011, PGP applicants were asked to include both Part 1 and Part 2 of the applications, thus mirroring the more streamlined process available for FC1s. Operations Bulletin 353 also instructed that sponsors who applied prior July 18, 2011, such as Dr. Attaran, should be contacted and requested to send the Part 2 of the application, with supporting documents, within 90 days.\n[296] Mr. Tetford confirmed that the letter from CIC dated March 30, 2012, requesting Dr. Attaran to submit Part 2 of the application (Exhibit 3) was created in accordance with and as a result of Operations Bulletin 353. Operations Bulletin 353 also stated that those applicants who had already submitted Part 2 of the application may be requested at a later date to provide updated forms. This suggests that, if the application took too long to finalize, the Part 2 forms might be considered stale and not current, and would have to be redone. (This was not the case for the Attaran family.)\n[297] As noted above, Cabinet sets the target ranges in the Levels Plan for FC1s high enough to absorb all the anticipated demand in the coming year. The intention is to not subject FC1s to backlogs and protracted waiting times. For the FC1 Family Class members, it is reasonable to conclude that their Part 2 applications will not become stale by \u201csitting on the shelf\u201d for a protracted period. As such, IRCC can request the simultaneous submission of the Part 1 and Part 2 applications to avoid delay through a two-stage application process.\n[298] The Commission and the Respondent do not make submissions specifically addressing this allegation. However, the Respondent points out in para. 88 of its Factum that all immigrants to Canada must be evaluated for their admissibility on the grounds of security, criminality, health and finances. The Part 2 applications for permanent residence contain detailed biographical information, including addresses and countries of residence since the applicant\u2019s 18th birthday and a list of any countries where the applicant has resided for more than 6 months. The information contained in the Part 2 application is required by IRCC in order for them to determine from which countries the applicants should provide police certificates. That is why it is important for the Part 2 application forms to be current. The police certificates are required to make a determination about potential inadmissibility for criminality under s.36 of IRPA. The Complainant has not challenged s.36 of IRPA.\n[299] When FC1 applications are processed in a very short period of time, the Part 2 application will not become stale. However, the efficiency of a simultaneous submission of Part 1 and Part 2 was not available at the time of Dr. Attaran\u2019s application. If the Part 2 application for permanent residence was submitted simultaneously with the Part 1 sponsorship for PGP application in 2009, it would certainly become stale as the application \u201csat on the shelf\u201d for two or more years. The applicant would need to re-submit an updated Part 2 application at the time it was ready to be reviewed by an officer, causing extra burden for the applicants and additional administration for IRCC.\n[300] In light of the foregoing, Dr. Attaran has failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that submitting the Part 2 application simultaneously for PGPs would have had any impact on speeding up the overall processing time of his application or PGP applications in general. Furthermore, this allegation was not plead in the Statements of Particulars of the Complainant or the Commission and had no demonstrable impact on the processing of his application. Even if I did find it to have adversely affected Dr. Attaran\u2019s application, which I do not, it would be prejudicial to the Respondent to allow this argument at this late stage. Therefore, this allegation is dismissed.\nB. More favourable timing for requests for medical examinations for FC1s\n[301] This allegation of adverse differential treatment is related to the one above concerning the permission for FC1s to simultaneously submit both parts of their applications up front. The Tribunal heard evidence that as part of every immigration application, in all categories, the applicants must undergo a medical examination. The evidence showed that the up-front medical examinations for FC1s enhanced the efficiency of submitting Part 1 and Part 2 of the application simultaneously. Important in the context of the up-front medical examinations permitted for FC1s, the Respondent\u2019s website stated: \u201cWhen CIC tested the joint application and up-front medical examination process, processing times were reduced by over 50% for routine cases.\u201d (Exhibit 63, at page 4.)\n[302] Mr. Tetford explained to the Tribunal that in the Family Class Re-Design Initiative of 2002-2004, it was decided that FC1 applicants could do their medical examination up front, prior to the actual submission of the application by their sponsor. The reasons were two-fold. Firstly, FC1 sponsors could submit Part 1 and Part 2 of the application at the same time. Secondly, given the Levels Plan targets to absorb all demand, there was a presumption that the applications would be reviewed quickly. The Part 2 application would be reviewed immediately after approval of Part 1, which at that time was taking an average of 42 days for most cases. As such, the medical examination and IRCC\u2019s review of the results could happen concurrently.\n[303] The results of the medical examination are valid for only 12 months (see IRPA Regulation 30(3).) Given that the processing time of the Part 1 application for FC1s was completed in a matter of a few short weeks, it was unlikely that the medical examination results would expire before the processing of the Part 2 of the application was completed and permanent resident visas could be issued. Allowing up front medical examinations for FC1s permitted the avoidance of possible time delays if the medical examinations were only requested later on in the process.\n[304] Exhibit 3 (the Part 2 of the application of the Complainant) contained a letter from the Respondent to Dr. Attaran\u2019s father dated July 23, 2012. This letter includes what appears to be standard content, some of which read as follows:\nAll applicants who are seeking permanent residence in Canada must satisfy Canada\u2019s medical inadmissibility criteria. In order to determine your medical admissibility to Canada, you and your spouse are required to undergo a medical examination. This examination is required whether or not your spouse will accompany you to Canada.\nPlease take this letter and the enclosed Medical Report Form IMM1017 for yourself and your spouse to the medical doctor performing the examination. You and your spouse should be examined by the same doctor.\nNOTE: Medical examinations completed prior to this request is (sic) not acceptable for the purpose of immigration to Canada.\n(Emphasis contained in original.)\n[305] The fact that FC1s were permitted to do their medical examinations in advance, without waiting for a request from the Respondent, is alleged to be adverse differential treatment of the PGP group, including Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents. Dr. Attaran also argues that older immigration applicants are more likely to develop age-related health issues that could make them inadmissible. As such, delaying their medical examination makes them more vulnerable to this risk. At para. 155 of his Factum, Dr. Attaran makes the assertion that an up-front medical examination \u201clocks-in a clean bill of health\u201d and that PGP\u2019s would not fear the consequences of falling ill while waiting for their turn in IRCC\u2019s backlog.\n[306] The Commission did not make submissions on this allegation of adverse differential treatment. As part of outlining general requirements for all immigrants, the Respondent made the observation that IRPA Regulation 30(3) requires the medical examination to have happened not more than twelve months prior to the date when an individual comes to Canada to land as a permanent resident (para. 89 of Respondent\u2019s Factum.)\n[307] The up-front medicals not being available to PGP applicants is a logical consequence of R.72(1)(e)(iii) of the IRPA Regulations and Levels Plan ranges for PGPs not meeting the demand. This subsection of the IRPA Regulations requires all foreign nationals, at the time they arrive in Canada with their permanent resident visa, in order to land and become a permanent resident at that moment, to be in possession of a medical certificate based on a medical examination which took place within the previous 12 months. Mr. Tetford testified that up-front medical examinations were not permitted in 2009 because they knew the finalization of Part 2 of the PGP applications within 12 months was foreseeably impossible. (Direct examination on February 8, 2021 @2:11:30.)\n[308] If Dr. Attaran\u2019s parents had been permitted to undergo their medical examinations up-front, in July of 2009, those medical results would have long expired before their permanent resident visas were ready to be issued in December of 2012. They would have been required to undergo medical examinations again within a timeframe that would allow the Respondent time to finalize their application, to issue their visas, and to give the Attarans some time to physically arrive in Canada to \u201cland\u201d with the visas before the twelve-month deadline (para. 89 of the Respondent\u2019s Factum).\n[309] In essence, this allegation is a disguised attack on the IRPA Regulations and\/or Levels Plans. The fact that up-front medical examinations were not permitted for PGPs was the result of other factors, like the Backlog Wait Time, that made the Processing Time take more than 12 months. In face of IRPA Regulations 30(3) and 72(1)(e)(iii), it is clear that permitting up-front medical examinations for PGP applicants would not have sped up their application processing times, nor would it have \u201clocked in\u201d an applicant\u2019s health status as of the time of their initial application. They would always have to do those medical examinations towards the end of their application processing to ensure they were within 12 months of landing with the visas.\n[310] As such, the Complainant has failed to demonstrate the Respondent\u2019s actions relating to the timing of the medical examinations contributed to longer processing times for PGPs or was otherwise adverse. The 12-month expiry under the IRPA Regulations prevented the \u201clocking in\u201d an early medical result. Given Levels Plan constraints that prevented on-demand processing similar to FC1s, this allegation is, effectively, a disguised attack on regulations and the Levels Plans. Furthermore, this allegation was not plead in the Statements of Particulars of the Complainant or the Commission. Even if I did find it to have adversely affected Dr. Attaran\u2019s application, which I do not, it would be prejudicial to the Respondent to allow this argument at this late stage. Therefore, this allegation is dismissed.\nC. Giving priority to so-called \u201cwild card\u201d relatives\n[311] Under R.117(1)(h) of the IRPA Regulations, there is a category of relatives who may be sponsored for immigration if certain conditions are met. These relatives include cousins, nephews, aunts and others who ordinarily would not be eligible for immigration in the Family Class. The conditions for eligibility are that the Canadian sponsor must not have any close relatives in Canada and no one in the FC1 or PGP subgroups who they could sponsor. IRCC refers to this group as the \u201cwild card\u201d relatives.\n[312] Given the eligibility requirements, the pool of potential Canadian sponsors is quite small. Dr. Attaran cited Exhibit 64 to quote then-Deputy Minister Yeates who said, \u201cFew applications of this type are received and by nature of the unique circumstances of these relationships they are afforded higher processing priority.\u201d In cross-examination, Mr. Tetford testified that wild card relatives under R.117(1)(h) were processed along with FC1 applicants in the faster processing stream. He admitted that these relatives could be more distant than a parent or grandparent, such as a cousin. However, they were processed much faster than the PGP sponsorship applications. There was no evidence to explain why the wild card relatives were processed in the faster stream, other than there were very few of them.\n[313] Exhibit 65, a letter from Deputy Minister Marta Morgan to the Commission dated July 7, 2016, concerning Dr. Attaran\u2019s complaint, confirmed that the number of wild card relative sponsorship applications received in 2010 was 1,002. By comparison, the number of PGP sponsorship applications received that year was for 39,886 persons.\n[314] Dr. Attaran\u2019s submissions make the observation that wild card relatives are not part of the nuclear family and include more distant relatives than parents or grandparents. However, they are processed by the Respondent as if they are part of the nuclear family. Dr. Attaran argues that strictly within the extended family, the wild card relatives are afforded the faster processing which is denied to the PGP subgroup and this constitutes adverse differential treatment.\n[315] The Commission did not make submissions on this allegation concerning wild card relative processing. The Respondent limited its submissions to observing the evidence (at para. 103 of the Respondent\u2019s Factum) that the number of so-called wild card immigrants did not exceed 500 in each of the last five years.\n[316] The source of this differential treatment between the wild card relatives and PGPs appears to be internal policy of the Respondent. The IRPA Regulations do not specify in what manner the wild card relatives should be processed. Their separation into the faster processing stream was in place before the creation of Ministerial Instructions. They are not identified as a separate sub-group in the Levels Plan.\n[317] The IRPA Regulations describe PGPs in R.117(1)(c) and (d). They are excluded from the definition of wild card relatives in R.117(1)(h). The wild card relatives are not subject to the limits in the Levels Plans that apply to PGPs. As such, there is no barrier to them being processed on an on-demand basis. Dr. Attaran has alleged more favourable treatment of the relatively few wild card relatives in the processing. However, given that PGPs could not be processed in the same manner, given separate regulatory definition and the application of Levels Plans that applied to PGPs, the Respondent did not engage in a discriminatory practice by treating wild card relatives differently.\n[318] Furthermore, this allegation was not plead in the Statements of Particulars of the Complainant or the Commission. Even if I did find it to have adversely affected Dr. Attaran\u2019s application, which I do not, it would be prejudicial to the Respondent to allow this argument at this late stage. Therefore, this allegation is dismissed.\nD. Service Standards\n[319] Dr. Attaran\u2019s alleges that the PGP applicants, including his parents, were subjected to adverse differential treatment because there were no \u201cservice standards\u201d established for that subgroup of the Family Class. By contrast, the 2002-2003 Family Class Re-Design Initiative did establish a service standard for the processing of FC1 applications.\n[320] Mr. Cardinal testified that service standards are requested by Treasury Board to give people a reasonable expectation about how long it will take various government agencies to deliver their services. IRCC articulated its service standards by stating the percentage of applications it expected to process within a certain target timeframe. At the time of the Re-Design, an official service standard was created for FC1 applications and other types of immigration applications, but not for PGPs. Mr. Cardinal said that he believed service standards were in place for more than 50% of the immigration sub-categories.\n[321] Mr. Tetford confirmed under cross-examination that at the time Dr. Attaran submitted his sponsorship application, there was still no service standard in place for PGPs. According to Mr. Tetford\u2019s recollection, the service standard at the time for FC1 applications was to have the Part 1 sponsorship application processed in 30-40 days.\n[322] In its final submissions, the Commission references Exhibit 174, which is an IRCC report for 2019-2020 outlining the service standards for various sub-categories of immigrants. In this document, also available on the IRCC website, the Respondent advertises service standards for Family Class overseas spouses, common-law partners and dependent children, but is silent about any service standard for parents and grandparents. The document goes on to give the Respondent\u2019s service standard for other immigration categories, such as the Canadian Experience class, the Federal Skilled Worker class, Provincial Nominee Program applicants, Quebec-selected Skilled Workers and the Trades Program.\n[323] During his chief and cross-examination by the Commission, Mr. Cardinal was asked why no service standards had ever been established for the PGP subgroup. Mr. Cardinal testified that the PGP program was not \u201cstable\u201d because of the many changes that were implemented, year over year, changing the way the program was administered. Changes to the way the inventory is drawn down and changes to the way intake of applications is managed are factors that culminated in IRCC not implementing service standards for the PGP subgroup. By contrast, Exhibit 174 showed a service standard for FC1s of 12 months for processing 80% of applications that had been in place since 2010.\n[324] Dr. Attaran and the Commission argue that the lack of a service standard for PGPs, while they exist for other members of the Family Class, is an adverse differential treatment resulting in slower processing times.\n[325] The Respondent argues that service standards are used by IRCC to provide people with \u201ca reliable expectation of how long they will wait in order to receive a service.\u201d They contrast this to a processing time, which is based on data that measures how long it actually takes IRCC to process an application (see para 143 of Respondent\u2019s Factum).\n[326] The evidence of Mr. Cardinal was that the requirement to create service standards was a request from Treasury Board. However, there was discretion at IRCC to create a service standard or not for various categories of immigration applications. I accept Mr. Cardinal\u2019s explanation that service standards for PGPs were not established because the program was subject to frequent changes, particularly through different Ministerial Instructions.\n[327] The evidence showed that different categories of immigration applications had different service standards associated with length of processing. The variance is a reflection of different prioritization, the Levels Plan and other external factors. The service standards in place are aspirational in nature, but subject to the above factors.\n[328] The Commission asks for a remedy of service standards for PGPs that \u201care in parity with other family class categories\u201d (para. 127 of the Commission\u2019s Factum) but the request ignores the external factors which will dictate what is even possible. As Mr. Cardinal testified, PGP applications by their nature generally take more time to process. Medical examinations more frequently need to be furthered or re-done, there is often more time taken to obtain older birth certificates, marriage and divorce certificates. PGPs take longer to return requested documents. (Direct examination of Mr. Cardinal on September 20, 2021 at 3:48:42. Also see Exhibit 127 \u2013 memo to Minister at Annex B. Page 4.)\n[329] Dr. Attaran and the Commission have not proven that the absence of service standards was a factor that, more likely than not, slowed the processing of applicants in the PGP sub-category. In the case of the Complainant, the evidence showed that the Application Review Wait Time for his Part 1 sponsorship application was 19 days. This was less than half of the 42-day estimate on IRCC\u2019s website for the processing of FC1 Part 1 applications at that time. Although the absence of service standards for PGPs is a differential treatment, the Complainant has failed to establish that it is adverse differential treatment. This allegation is dismissed.\nE. The Processing of PGP Sponsorship Applications at CPC-Mississauga was suspended from May 2004 to September 2005\n[330] In Dr. Attaran\u2019s Factum, he created a chart in paragraph 69 to illustrate how the processing times for PGPs rapidly diverged from the processing times for FC1s over time. Up until 2003, the processing times had been closely matched. At para. 145 of his Factum, he alleges the Respondent used its discretion to suspend the processing of PGP applications at CPC-M for 16 months which contributed greatly to the increase.\n[331] During his cross-examination by Dr. Attaran, Mr. Tetford spoke about the suspension of the processing of FC4 (PGP) applications from May 2004 to September 2005 and acknowledged this was one of the reasons that the processing times for PGP sponsorship applications increased so dramatically, as illustrated in Dr. Attaran\u2019s chart.\n[332] The Tribunal was again taken to Exhibit 18, the CIC policy document from June 2007, which reads as follows in the second paragraph of page 15:\nThird, the processing of parent and grandparent sponsorship applications at CPC-M was suspended between May 2004 and September 2005. This was done in order to devote operational resources to the processing of spouses and dependants. While the CPC-M inventory for FC4s in 2002-2003 was at 3,347 with a processing time of only 38 days, by the time processing had resumed in September 2005, the FC4 inventory had grown to 81,593, with a processing time of 2.3 years.\n[333] Dr. Attaran asked Mr. Tetford if during this period of time, or if during the moratorium from 2011-2014, other sub-categories in the Family Class were also suspended. Mr. Tetford answered no, and clarified that in 2004-2005, CPC-M suspended the processing of applications already in the Inventory and those continuing to arrive. During the moratorium of 2011-2014, IRCC did not accept any new applications for PGP sponsorship.\n[334] The Commission did not make submissions on this allegation. In their final argument, the Respondent states that IRCC stopped processing the sponsorship applications at CPC-M in 2004-2005 because if not, it would have needlessly shifted the Backlog to the overseas offices handling the Part 2 permanent residency applications. There was already an accumulated Inventory in those overseas offices, so continuing to process cases at CPC-M during that period would not have alleviated the Backlog. The Respondent also argues that it was not possible for CPC-Mississauga to simply stop accepting new sponsorship applications without the intervention of Parliament or Cabinet (para. 116 of the Respondent\u2019s Factum.)\n[335] I agree with the Respondent. While there may have been some measures that could have been taken to curb the demand, I saw no evidence that IRCC had the authority to outright refuse the acceptance of new applications until the introduction of Ministerial Instructions in 2008.\n[336] In my view, the suspension of processing of PGP applications from May 2004 to September 2005 was differential treatment. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that the IRCC\u2019s suspension contributed to the total time to process a PGP application all the way to visa issuance. At that time, in 2004-2005, there were already enough files in Inventory in the overseas offices to meet processing targets. The suspension of processing at CPC-M merely kept the files in Backlog in Canada rather than in the overseas offices. The actions taken at CPC-M to suspend processing were in response to the Levels Plan admission targets for PGPs, which had been greatly reduced for 2004 and 2005. The source of this action was the Levels Plan. Moreover, I find the claim that this policy was adverse is too remote from the timing of Dr. Attaran\u2019s own complaint. The impact the suspension might have had on processing times of PGP application four years later is too speculative to be considered further.\nF. Deliberate Shifting of Resources Away from PGPs with the Family Class Re-Design Initiative in 2002-2004 leading to \u201cPriority Processing\u201d for FC1s\n[337] Dr. Attaran alleges that IRCC explicitly chose to demote PGP applicants to a lower tier status (see para. 50 of Complainant\u2019s Factum.) He quotes another passage from Exhibit 18, the 2007 CIC document entitled \u201cPolicy Approaches for the Future of the Parents and Grandparents Category\u201d drafted by Tracey Bender of the Social Policy and Programs Division, Immigration Branch. The first paragraph on page 15 of this document reads:\nSecond, in April 2003, priority processing within 6 months was implemented for spouses and dependant children. A decision was also taken to decrease the parent and grandparent target ranges in 2004 and 2005 in order to shift operational resources to the processing of spouses and children. The result was that the numbers of parents and grandparents landed in 2004 and 2005 were the lowest in 11 years (12,732 and 12,471 respectively).\n[338] Dr. Attaran also referred to how the IRCC \u201cundershot\u201d the Levels Plans ranges for PGPs from 2007-2010. Dr. Attaran alleges this deliberate shift of operational resources, away from the processing of PGP applications, to the processing of spouses and children, amounts to adverse differential treatment.\n[339] I agree that the shift of resources involved differential treatment of the PGP subgroup. However, as discussed above, the impugned service is IRCC\u2019s processing of applications, which involves the implementation of Levels Plans ranges set by Cabinet. Were the Levels Plans the source of the adverse differential treatment? Was IRCC simply implementing the priorities inherent in the target ranges set for FC1s compared to PGPs while facing high demand for PGP sponsorship?\n[340] In 2002, the upper target for PGPs in the Levels Plan was 21,000. For 2004, it was lowered to 13,500. For 2005, the Levels Plan for PGP admissions set a range of 5,500 \u2013 6,800. In 2005, there was a public outcry and the levels were increased to 17,500-18,800. (See Exhibit 160, CIC Executive Committee presentation dated June 30, 2011, Annex C and notes.)\n[341] As Ms. Bender correctly points out, the Levels Plan for 2004 and 2005 reduced the target ranges for PGPs significantly. IRCC processed applications in those years in a manner aimed to land within the Levels Plan target ranges. Accordingly, this shift in operational resources, leading to priority processing for FC1s, is derived from the targets set in the Levels Plan. As such, this allegation is really an attack on the Levels Plan for those years. Furthermore, the shift substantially predated the Attaran family\u2019s application. I do not find that the Complainant and Commission have established a discriminatory practice on a balance of probabilities. This alleged discriminatory practice will not be considered further.\n[342] Regarding the alleged undershooting of targets in 2007-2010, the data referred to by the Complainant does not establish a discriminatory practice. In 2010, IRCC actually landed 334 more PGPs than the minimum target of 15,000. During the years 2007, 2008 and 2009, the minimum target for PGPs was missed, but by only an average of 8.2% below the target. The Complainant provided data for certain other categories in those years where the actual landings overshot the maximum target range. However, upon closer examination, the average overshot for these 3 or 4 different categories cited in those years is only 11.3%. I find this consistent with the evidence that meeting the target range was not always achieved despite best efforts. The degree of undershot or overshot appears to be within a reasonable margin of error. (The various other categories not cited by Dr. Attaran fell below or within the target ranges.) The variations cited are not grossly out of line with the Levels Plan. On the other hand, to admit PGPs to Canada on-demand, in parity with FC1s, would have required overshooting their target ranges by enormous margins, which I have found (further above) is not an option that is available to the Respondent under the regime imposed by IRPA, the IRPA Regulations and the Levels Plans.\nG. Was the Manner in which IRCC Reported Processing Times Reported to the Public for PGP Applications an Adverse Differential Treatment in the Provision of a Service?\n[343] Over the course of the hearing, the Tribunal heard evidence about the different ways the Respondent reports processing times to the public for the various subgroups of immigration applications. Some reporting is based on the actual length of time it has taken. For example, the report might say, \u201capplications being approved today were submitted on X date.\u201d This is a retrospective reporting on actual timelines. This would not necessarily be a good indicator of how long it would take to process a new case submitted today because the impact of factors such as intake controls would not necessarily be apparent. In other instances, the Respondent would give a forward-looking estimate of how much time it anticipated it would take to process a certain type of application.\n[344] This allegation arose in Dr. Attaran\u2019s Reply Factum where he cites an admission in para. 133 of the Respondent\u2019s Factum that IRCC implemented a change in how it calculates processing times for PGPs. According to the Respondent\u2019s submission, after intake controls for PGPs were implemented, CPC-Mississauga commenced a more thorough check of applications for completeness once they were received. If IRCC identified any missing documents, IRCC would request the documents from the applicant. However, the processing time for the application would only be calculated starting from the date when all of the required documentation had been received by IRCC, as opposed to starting from the date the incomplete application had been received. As such, any time IRCC spent waiting for missing documentation to be provided by the applicant would not be included in reported processing times.\n[345] Dr. Attaran alleges that postponing the start of the clock until completeness for PGP applications, rather than using the receipt date for incomplete applications (as is done for FC1 applications) means that IRCC\u2019s sponsorship processing times for PGP applications are understated. \u201cIn other words, IRCC fudges its wait times, to make the difference with spouses, partners, and children look less glaring.\u201d (Complainant\u2019s Reply Factum at para. 55.)\n[346] I concur that the reporting methods were different for PGPs than they were for the FC1 subgroup. However, I am not persuaded the reporting methods had any adverse differential impact on the processing time for the PGP applications, which is the essence of this complaint. That said, transparency in the reporting of processing times for PGP applications is obviously important to potential applicants who may be considering whether to apply, and for whom wait time may be a very important factor in their decision-making. However, the Complainant and the Commission have not demonstrated this alleged differential treatment had any impact on wait times or the Complainant\u2019s application. Moreover, this allegation was not raised in Dr. Attaran\u2019s SOP, and raised only in his Reply Factum, which was prejudicial to the Respondent\u2019s ability to address it. Accordingly, this allegation of adverse differential treatment is dismissed.\nH. Disproportionately low numbers of PGPs were admitted to Canada as Permanent Residents from 2007-2019\n[347] Dr. Attaran did not make specific allegations of adverse differential treatment on these grounds. This argument was raised by the Commission. It is not a separate allegation of a particular policy or procedure, but more a submission on the cumulative impacts of the alleged discriminatory practices and alleged intentionality on the part of the Respondent. The Respondent did not respond to these allegations of intentional marginalization either.\n[348] The Commission compiled statistics in their Factum (at para. 86) to show what a low number PGPs made up of the total number of immigrants admitted from 2007-2019. According to their rough calculations, PGPs made up 26% of the Family Class and only 6.79% of the total number of immigrants admitted during this period.\n[349] The Commission alleges that the pressure to allocate as much space as possible to the economic class may assist in explaining the marginalization of the PGP group. They referenced to the testimony of IRCC witness Glen Bornais who spoke of the tension that sometimes exists between two principles of IRPA\u2019s objectives: a prosperous Canadian economy; and family reunification. Mr. Bornais spoke about the ongoing consultations with the provinces and territories during his tenure from about 2007 to 2018. He said there was a general consensus to keep immigration levels stable, or even to increase them, but there was \u201ca definite preference for, for favouring or prioritizing economic programs.\u201d (Hearing recording on Feb 10, 2021 \u2013 Direct Examination of Mr. Bornais.)\n[350] The Commission alleges that the Respondent has intentionally marginalized PGPs given its aggressive tools to manage the program and regulations in an effort to mitigate possible negative economic impacts on the country. They cite the imposition of a minimum necessary income for sponsors and the lengthy financial undertakings the sponsors are required to sign. Given that these requirements of PGP sponsors are more onerous than the requirements for sponsors of the FC1 group, the Commission suggests this is based on a certain perception IRCC has of parents and grandparents and \u201cdemonstrates a concern to manage the impact of the group on Canada\u2019s treasury,\u201d (para. 95 of CHRC\u2019s Factum.)\n[351] The Commission further alleges marginalization of the PGP group by restricting sponsorship to only those who can afford it:\n\u201cNotably, this also suggests that family reunification insofar as parents and grandparents are concerned may be reserved for those new Canadians and established Canadians who can afford it. This aspect serves as additional indicia of the marginalization of this group. They are to be dependant on their sponsors for a long period of time, evidently correlated with their life expectancy, to minimize their burden on the Canadian economy.\u201d (Para 95 of CHRC\u2019s Factum.)\n[352] The outcome that PGPs made up only 6.7% of total immigrants during the period of 2007-2019 is derived from many factors. The higher incomes required and longer undertakings may have contributed to this outcome. However, those factors are dealt with separately above and found to result from regulations, which are not impugned in this complaint. The lower numbers for PGPs overall are a direct result of the consistently low numbers allocated to PGP admissions in the Levels Plans, which are also not impugned in this complaint.\n[353] The Respondent has suggested the lower admission numbers are a result of the government\u2019s concern about negative financial impact on Canada\u2019s resources. It may well have been the intention of the Cabinet to limit the numbers of PGP immigrants to mitigate negative impacts on healthcare delivery systems and other limited resources. Insofar as those decisions were governed by the regime of IRPA, the IRPA Regulations, Levels Plans and Ministerial Instructions, they would lie beyond the scope of this inquiry for the reasons above.\n[354] To succeed in this allegation, the Commission would have to demonstrate that the actions of IRCC, within its authority, exacerbated the lower number of PGP admissions. The reasons above outline why the Commission has fallen short of this burden of proof. Even in the case of years when IRCC undershot the target ranges for PGPs, the Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Cardinal that the deviations were the result of factors beyond its control, such as delays in overseas offices, landing lag and visa wastage.\n[355] Accordingly, I do not find that the overall disproportionately low numbers of admissions in the PGP category reflected adverse differential treatment in the provision of a service by the Respondent.\nXVI. CONCLUSION ABOUT PRIMA FACIE CASE [356] As indicated above, the Complainant has established the first part of the Moore test: that he has characteristics that are prohibited for discrimination under the CHRA.\n[357] At this stage of the analysis, I must examine whether the second part of the test in Moore has been met: the Complainant must demonstrate that he experienced an adverse impact with respect to a service provided to him by the Respondent. In this regard, the Complainant and the Commission have failed and the prima facie case has not been established.\n[358] In review of the reasons above, there was insufficient evidence to convince me, on a balance of probabilities, that the following impugned actions resulted in adverse differential treatment in the Respondent\u2019s provision of a service:\nNot allowing streamlined processing (simultaneous submission of Part 1 and Part 2 of the applications) for PGP applicants;\nThe disallowance of up-front medical examinations for PGP applicants;\nAllowing the wild card relatives to be processed in the faster stream with spouses and children;\nNot having any service standards for processing in place for the PGP subgroup;\nThe suspension of PGP sponsorship applications at CPC-Mississauga in 2004 and 2005;\nThe shifting of resources towards FC1 applications;\nThe manner in which the Respondent reports processing times for PGP applications; and\nThe alleged intentional marginalization of PGP applicants.\n[359] The Complainant and the Commission also challenged the way IRCC implemented the Levels Plans. I concluded above that the establishment and application of the Levels Plans are not a service under the CHRA and the discretion for IRCC to ignore or circumvent the Levels Plans did not exist.\n[360] The next set of impugned actions are based on the Ministerial Instructions. I found that Ministerial Instructions could not be considered a service under the CHRA.\n[361] The remaining allegation concerns the failure of the Minister to exercise his authority under s. 25.2(1) of IRPA to exempt PGP sponsors and applicants from any IRPA Regulations which could be considered discriminatory on a prohibited ground under the CHRA. This allegation was, in essence, an attack on offending regulations. The Complainant and Commission bear the burden of proof and did not establish that regulation-making is a service, and specifically suggested the Tribunal not determine that question.\n[362] The complaint is dismissed because the Complainant and the Commission have failed to make a prima facie case. While they have demonstrated differentiations and ways in which PGP applications were processed more slowly than other categories, the Complainant and Commission have not discharged their burden of showing that the Respondent engaged in a discriminatory practice. For each allegation discussed above, either there was no adverse differential treatment established, or the adverse differential treatment alleged was explained by something that was not proven to be a \u201cservice\u201d under s.5 of the CHRA.\nXVII. Additional Rulings A. Confidentiality Rulings\n[363] An inquiry before the CHRT is always conducted in public, but with limited exceptions. Under s. 52 of the CHRA, a panel of the CHRT may make an order for confidentiality that it considers necessary for a reason articulated under that section. In the matter before me, I granted orders of confidentiality for two sets of information when requested by the parties.\n[364] On the first day of the hearing, Dr. Attaran requested confidentiality for the personal information contained in two sets of documents admitted as exhibits 2 and 3. Exhibits 2 and 3 are the sets of application forms and supporting documents that Dr. Attaran and his parents submitted to the Respondent to begin the immigration sponsorship application for his parents. There is considerable personal information contained in the exhibits, including Dr. Attaran\u2019s Notice of Assessment from Canada Revenue Agency, a letter from his employer and a copies of identity documents. While this application is central to the facts of this complaint, the information contained in those forms and the supporting documents that form part of Exhibits 2 and 3 are not germane to the issues before the Tribunal. There is substantial risk that the disclosure of such personal information will cause undue hardship to the Complainant and his family. The language in the forms themselves, and certain boilerplate language in form letters from the Respondent have some relevance. Accordingly, the information contained in the forms and the supporting documents that comprise parts of Exhibits 2 and 3 are subject to confidentiality under s.52(1)(c) of the Act. The answers in the forms, personal information in letters and the supporting documents are to be redacted to maintain the confidentiality of their personal information\n[365] I have also made reference to the dates of correspondence back and forth in Exhibit 3, which are also referred to in Exhibit 82, the Global Case Management System printout of the Respondent for Dr. Attaran\u2019s file. As Exhibit 82 also contains sensitive personal information, I am hereby ordering personal information in Exhibit 82 to be redacted, but not the dates of correspondence therein.\n[366] The second set of information for which I granted confidentiality relates to the medical information concerning Mr. Bornais, the Respondent\u2019s witness. As mentioned above, Mr. Bornais was unable to complete his testimony before the Tribunal due to medical reasons. I agreed to grant an order of confidentiality for the two medical letters the Tribunal received about his condition. A letter of direction, a recording of a CMCC and some portions of the official recording of the hearing were also made subject to this confidentiality order under s.52(1)(c) of the Act.\n[367] The second confidentiality order became contentious when the parties submitted their final arguments in writing. The Complainant included in his Factum actual quotations from the confidential letters and made other references to the nature of the medical illness which was the subject of the confidentiality order. This prompted the Respondent counsel to write to me on February 14, 2022, to clarify what had been ordered confidential and to make note of certain sections of the Complainant\u2019s written submissions which they felt were caught by the confidentiality order. The Complainant also mentioned a portion of the hearing recording on the morning of April 30, 2021, that was to be subject to the confidentiality order.\n[368] I wrote a letter of direction to the parties on March 3, 2022, to clarify the scope of my original confidentiality order. Although not as broadly as asserted by Respondent counsel, I did clarify that paragraphs 203, 204 and 211 of the Complainant\u2019s Factum dated December 3, 2021, should be redacted. Paragraphs 203 and 211 contained verbatim quotations (in quotation marks) of the letters that I had ordered to be kept confidential. Paragraph 204 contained five references to the nature of the witness\u2019 medical condition which was the subject of the confidentiality order and, in my view, contravened the spirit and intention of the order.\n[369] With respect to a portion of the audio recording on April 30, 2021, Dr. Attaran did make a verbal reference to the medical condition of the witness during an exchange amongst counsel. A few minutes later, Mr. Stynes mentioned that the discussion ventured into the area that was subject to the existing confidential order. Dr. Attaran acknowledged his mistake and apologized on the record. He also said that he had no objection and consented to the removal of that part of the audio recording from the public record.\nB. The Cabinet Privilege Disclosure Motion and Follow-Up Litigation\n[370] A motion for further document disclosure was made by Dr. Attaran after the ninth day of the hearing. As the Respondent objected to the disclosure on the grounds of Cabinet Privilege, I requested that submissions be made in writing. In order to preserve the next set of hearing dates scheduled, I delivered a brief, interim ruling on the motion in a letter to the parties dated March 26, 2021. The letter indicated that I would give more fulsome reasons in the final merit decision, which are now set out in this section.\n[371] The second witness of the Respondent, Mr. Bornais, had worked as an advisor to senior officials at IRCC. His work was at a very high level and was sometimes related to the Levels Plans that were decided upon by Cabinet further to s.94 of IRPA. During his cross-examination by Dr. Attaran, the testimony of Mr. Bornais touched on the existence of certain documents that had not been previously disclosed by IRCC. During the cross-examination, Respondent counsel raised several objections to questions being put to the witness by Dr. Attaran. The issue of Cabinet Privilege, otherwise known as a confidence of the Queen\u2019s Privy Council for Canada, was claimed and Mr. Bornais cited this privilege to explain his reluctance to answer certain questions. (As mentioned above, Mr. Bornais was unable to complete his testimony for medical reasons.)\n[372] As Mr. Bornais made reference to certain documents that were not previously disclosed, Dr. Attaran made a request for their disclosure. As the Respondent made a claim of privilege in response, it was not prudent for me to make a ruling from the dais. Accordingly, I requested the parties make written submissions on the motion for disclosure for the documents mentioned in Mr. Bornais\u2019 testimony. As the hearing was scheduled to resume in April 2021, I gave the parties only four weeks to make written submissions.\n[373] Dr. Attaran and the Commission made a joint motion for the disclosure. The requests were initially exchanged by way of email directly amongst the parties. However, the written motion repeated the materials requested, from 2008 to present, as follows:\nAll memoranda and briefing materials to the Minister (but excluding those sent to Cabinet for the purpose of briefing it) and all FPT consultation materials related to developing the annual Levels Plans, and which: (1) contain or comment upon the scenarios that were prepared by the department, or (2) form part of the signal checking that took place with the Minister\u2019s office. Further, and with respect to the assertion that the Levels Plan is a Cabinet decision not a discretionary departmental decision, and: (3) any Orders-in-Council containing Cabinet\u2019s decision on the Levels Plan, as these are public and not Cabinet confidences.\n[374] The motion argued that the evidence of Mr. Bornais disclosed that before annual Levels Plans are set by Cabinet, there is extensive preparatory work performed by IRCC in a continuing exercise of weighing trade-offs in priorities and in exercising discretion of both IRCC staff and the Minister. That preparatory work includes the creation of memoranda and FPT (Federal-Provincial-Territorial) consultation materials.\n[375] In support of the arguable relevance of these documents, the motion pointed out that there had already been disclosure of several similar documents.\n[376] The Respondent\u2019s main arguments were that the documents were not arguably relevant and if they were, they were subject to Cabinet Privilege. On the relevance argument, Respondent counsel framed the issue before the Tribunal as being about the actual processing time for Dr. Attaran\u2019s sponsorship application. The case is not, they argued, about how the processing time might have been different if there were different Levels Plans set; the Levels Plans were what the Levels Plans were at the time of the application in 2009.\n[377] Respondent counsel accused the Complainant and the Commission of shifting their argument mid-hearing to allege that the Levels Plan is the service being offered. In their view, there was a procedural fairness question at issue because they felt the Complainant and the Commission had not plead their case along the lines of the Levels Plans being the service.\n[378] The Respondent also warned that if the Tribunal did conclude that the requested documents were relevant, then they would be forced to make an application to the Clerk of the Privy Council under s.39 of the Canada Evidence Act (\u201cCEA\u201d) to request a certificate for those documents deemed to fall under Cabinet Privilege. That application could take up to six months, they warned.\n[379] Dr. Attaran made the point that s.39 of the CEA also permits a Minister of the Crown to grant the certification for Cabinet Privilege, in which case, it might take a lot less than 6 months. In reply, Mr. Stynes argued there was a \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d which would not permit a Minister to grant certification over Cabinet Privileged documents that originated from a different government. In this case, it would be asking a Liberal government Minister to make a determination about documents during a period, prior to 2015, that were under the purview of the former Conservative government.\n[380] Respondent counsel suggested the merits of the request need be balanced against potential for delay, and cited my decision in Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (2017 CHRT 28) (\u201cBrickner\u201d) at paragraphs 7 and 8:\n[7] \u2026.in the search for truth and despite the arguable relevance of evidence, the Tribunal may exercise its discretion to deny a motion for disclosure, so long as the requirements of natural justice and the Rules are respected, in order to ensure the informal and expeditious conduct of the inquiry (see Gil v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 8407 (FC) at para. 13; see also s. 48.9(1) of the Act).\n[8] This Tribunal \u2026 may deny ordering the disclosure of evidence where the probative value of such evidence would not outweigh its prejudicial effect on the proceedings. Notably, the Tribunal should be cautious about ordering searches where a party or a stranger to the litigation would be subjected to an onerous and far-reaching search for documents, especially where ordering disclosure would risk adding substantial delay to the efficiency of the inquiry or where the documents are merely related to a side issue rather than the main issues in dispute (see Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22 at para. 4; Seeley at para. 7; see also R. v. Seaboyer [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at 609-611). [emphasis added by Respondent counsel].\n[381] Given that the hearing was not set to resume for several more weeks, I felt the disclosure order would not unduly delay the hearing from finishing and, as events unfolded, that proved to be true.\n[382] The Tribunal has also established that for the purpose of analyzing the arguable relevance of documents, the complaint, the theory of the case contained in each parties\u2019 Statement of Particulars, and the entire Statement of Particulars of each party all serve as guides. As stated in Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada v Canadian Broadcasting Corporation:\nFor the purposes of disclosure, the complaint, the theory of the case included in the Statement of Particulars and the entire Statement of Particulars in itself, all serve as guides for identifying the potential relevance of the documents. This potential relevance will be analyzed from both the point of view of the complaining party and the respondent or the party representing the public interest, in this case, the Commission. In other words, the documents to be disclosed are not limited to those which support the position of a single party, but the positions of all the parties. [Emphasis added by counsel] Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada v Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2017 CHRT 5, at para. 36.\n[383] In reviewing the Statements of Particulars of the parties, I concluded that there was a sufficient connection to the Levels Plans. The Commission and the Respondent in particular set out arguments related to the Levels Plans and their role in determining the number of PGP admissions and the priorities applied. As such, I concluded that the documents being requested under the motion were at least arguably relevant.\n[384] Section 50(1) of the CHRA provides that all parties appearing before the Tribunal must be given \u201ca full and ample opportunity, in person or through counsel, to appear at the inquiry, present evidence and make representations.\u201d The Tribunal\u2019s previous Rules of Procedure for Proceedings Prior to July 11, 2021, which applied to this matter (the \u201cRules\u201d) stipulate documentary disclosure obligations aimed at ensuring parties are granted this opportunity.\n[385] Rules 6(1)(d) and 6(4) require parties to file a list of non-privileged documents which relate to facts, issues, or forms of relief identified by parties to the case, and to disclose copies of all such documents to the other parties. Rule 6(1)(e) requires parties to provide a list of all documents over which privileged is claimed. (However, parties are not required to disclose copies of such privileged documents.) The Rules also stipulate that the disclosure obligation of parties is ongoing. Rule 6(5) states that a party must provide additional disclosure either where new facts, issues, or remedies are identified, or where the party discovers that its compliance with its disclosure obligations is inaccurate or incomplete.\n[386] Prior to issuing my ruling of March 26, 2021, Respondent counsel estimated that the number of documents arising from the Complainant\u2019s motion might be in the number of 50-100. Some of them could be disclosed forthwith in accordance with the Rules. However, my order stipulated that if any of the documents were claimed to be subject to Cabinet Privilege, the Respondent was ordered to list those documents in accordance with Rule 6(1)(e) and to articulate on that list specifically why s. 39(4) of the CEA does not apply to them. I further ordered that for those documents claimed to be subject to Cabinet Privilege, the Respondent must obtain a certificate from a Minister of the Crown or the Clerk of the Privy Council in accordance with s. 39 of the CEA. I gave the Respondent a deadline of April 30, 2021, but also indicated I would entertain a request for an extension, if necessary. (I subsequently granted an extension to July 30, 2021.)\n[387] There were a number of documents that were disclosed as a result of my ruling for which privilege was not claimed. However, the Complainant was not satisfied and insisted on waiting for a ruling from the Clerk of the Privy Council regarding the determination for the balance of the documents. I had been hopeful that the Respondent might seek a determination from the responsible Minister, as that might have taken less time than seeking certification from the Clerk of the Privy Council. However, the Respondent insisted the \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d prevented that approach, even though there was very little offered in terms of proof that such a convention exists. Furthermore, the Respondent did not comply with my request that it specify in its list of documents why s. 39(4) of the CEA, which enumerates exceptions to Cabinet Privilege, did not apply.\n[388] Nevertheless, when the hearing resumed in late April, 2021, the Respondent counsel requested a further extension of time to receive the certification from the Clerk of the Privy Council. I granted the extension request and the certification from the Interim Clerk, which excluded 31 documents from disclosure, was granted on July 14, 2021.\n[389] The certification from the Interim Clerk was forwarded to the other parties and Respondent counsel provided partially redacted copies of certain documents as well as a list of other documents subject to claims under s. 38 of the CEA as well as notice of another document protected under s. 37 of the CEA.\n[390] The disclosure order gave rise to a concern on the part of the Respondent that notice provisions had been triggered pursuant to s. 38.01(1) of the CEA. This eventually led to the National Security Group of the Department of Justice making an ex parte application to the Federal Court on November 5, 2021, regarding certain documents that were previously disclosed. On November 9, 2021, Justice Kane ordered that Dr. Attaran be identified as a Respondent in the application and that the matter, filed under s. 38.04(2) of the CEA be made public.\n[391] When Dr. Attaran received the Amended Notice of Application dated November 9, 2021, he forwarded a copy to the Tribunal and advised that he would no longer be able to meet his deadline for final argument submissions as a result.\n[392] At a subsequent CMCC, Mr. Stynes, advised that the application concerned documents that were disclosed on September 16, 2021. Two of those disclosures were entered as Exhibits 191 and 192 during the hearing. The redacted portions of those documents related to matters not material to the issues before the Tribunal.\n[393] Nevertheless, the Federal Court application was an untimely distraction for the parties and the deadlines for written final argument submissions had to be delayed again.\n[394] Dr. Attaran subsequently made an application for costs in that matter which was dismissed by Justice Kane on March 16, 2022 (See Canada (Attorney General) v. Attaran 2022 FC 353).\nSigned by\nDavid L.

ADDENDUM -The Bias Allegation [395] Any allegation of bias against a decision-maker is a very serious matter. Unfortunately, this allegation was made during the hearing. This decision would be incomplete if I did not address the incident and give my reasons for continuing with the inquiry after the allegation was levelled. The allegation did not affect my analysis in this decision in any way.\n[396] To briefly give context, when the hearing resumed on April 29, 2021, it began with my ruling to admit the Respondent\u2019s expert witness, Prof. Michael Haan and his expert report. As noted above, this followed almost two days of cross-examination of Prof. Haan on his expertise and an entire afternoon of argument about whether or not I should accept him as an expert at all.\n[397] It appeared to me that Dr. Attaran was displeased with my ruling. During Mr. Stynes\u2019 direct examination of Prof. Haan\u2019s expert report, Dr. Attaran made two objections when reference was made to data sets involving health costs. Dr. Attaran\u2019s objected that Prof. Haan was not qualified as a health expert. When I overruled the second objection, Dr. Attaran made his first of several insinuations that I was giving preferential treatment to the witness because he shared my gender and racial characteristics. Dr. Attaran said, \u201cThere has to be a limit, Chair\u2026.There is a propensity to think that every professor who is a white man is an expert in everything.\u201d (Hearing Recording at 2:49 on April 29, 2021.)\n[398] The next morning, Dr. Attaran made a similar insinuation. He accused me of being inconsistent in a ruling when compared to questioning of his expert witness. He said, \u201cThe one time it happened, the professor was Asian and female, and this time it happened, the professor is white and male. I will leave that on the record.\u201d (Hearing Recording at 2:10 on April 30, 2021.) Over the course of these two days, I counted several instances when Dr. Attaran made insinuations that I was treating Prof. Haan with some preference because, like the witness, I am also white and male.\n[399] In an administrative hearing such as this one, the adjudicator has different roles to play. Firstly, the adjudicator must be impartial, and must not be in any conflict of interest with the parties, whether that conflict is real or perceived. The adjudicator sits in the hearing to receive information, testimony and legal argument. The parties are entitled to test each other\u2019s evidence to ensure the adjudicator gets the best information upon which to base their decision.\n[400] This hearing was unlike any I have adjudicated before in terms of the sheer number of objections and rulings I was asked to make. I was also forced on several occasions to ask the parties to maintain proper decorum and to refrain from making petty comments and insults to each other. I also asked that parties refrain from suggesting others are not meeting their obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct of the Law Society of Ontario. I had to make all sorts of rulings over the course of this inquiry. I suspect all parties were unhappy with some of my rulings from time to time.\n[401] Dr. Attaran made his allegation of bias after we returned from a 20-minute break during his cross-examination of Prof. Haan. Before the break, Respondent counsel, Mr. Stynes, had raised objection to the questions being put to his witness. He said that Dr. Attaran was attempting to intimidate and bully his witness by going after his academic integrity. Dr. Attaran started to lead questions to the witness about his possible ethical violations and professional misconduct.\n[402] The exchange concerning the questioning of ethical violations and professional misconduct was heated, which eventually led me to call for the 20-minute break. Prof. Haan had been excluded from the hearing room after Mr. Stynes\u2019 objection while counsel discussed the line of questioning. I told Dr. Attaran that I did not want witnesses bullied, threatened or intimidated. I reiterated that as the adjudicator, that, \u201cI am trying to maintain some decorum here, and so I would ask for your cooperation in that, and just in the mannerisms, and there are little things, Dr. Attaran, that you say and you do, and the expressions you make, but they are intimidating to people. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for us, to get through the evidence that will allow this Tribunal to make a decision on the issues that are before it.\u201d\n[403] In hindsight, these were not the best words I could have chosen. I was trying to avoid inflammatory language, but I thought it was clear to all parties, and members of the gallery, about what I meant when I referred to \u201cmannerisms\u201d and things that Dr. Attaran did during the course of the hearing. I used the word \u201cmannerisms\u201d, but the more accurate word would have been \u201ctheatrics\u201d that Dr. Attaran performed as others spoke, such as rolling his head back, mock-laughing and throwing his face into his hands.\n[404] Nevertheless, Dr. Attaran stated he had never before been criticized for his \u201cmannerisms\u201d by an adjudicator and made the suggestion that what I had just said had something to do with him being a visible minority. Dr. Attaran then again implied that I was racially biased and sexist in my conduct. My comment had nothing to do with any ethnicity of Dr. Attaran. This is when I decided it was time to take the 20-minute break.\n[405] I had resolved to bring order back to the hearing room, and grant the widest discretion permissible for Dr. Attaran to ask the questions he wanted for the remainder of his cross-examination. However, before I said anything upon our return, Dr. Attaran made a statement about his perception of my bias:\n\u201cBut I think the manner in which you criticized me, for the way which I speak or my mannerisms, and saying that I may not even be aware of it, but it\u2019s disrespectful. I don\u2019t think you should have done that. And I honestly feel it gives rise to an apprehension of unconscious bias. I have spent my entire working life, as a minority person, being told I should speak differently, I should behave differently, it is not something I welcome. And I am unhappy that it has happened here and from somebody I respect, as I very much do you. The caselaw requires me to put notice of an apprehension of bias on the record when it happens. So I am doing that without acrimony.\u201d (Hearing Recording at 2:12 on April 30, 2021.)\n[406] I immediately asked Dr. Attaran if he was asking me to recuse myself. He said in reply that he was asking me to give thought to whether I should or if I should have made the statement that was made.\n[407] The Respondent counsel was surprised at the allegation and sought clarification if Dr. Attaran intended to bring a motion for my recusal. Dr. Attaran replied that he did not intend to bring such a motion and that he was \u201chappy to proceed\u201d with his cross-examination of Prof. Haan.\n[408] Respondent counsel requested a lengthy recess to conduct research on the matter, which I granted. Dr. Attaran went into a caucus with counsel for the Commission. I thought over the break the parties might absorb the magnitude of what had just transpired.\n[409] When we returned from the recess, the Respondent counsel presented caselaw about the seriousness of making an allegation of bias against a decision-maker, especially mid-hearing. They suggested that Dr. Attaran should either bring a motion for recusal or completely withdraw his allegation of bias before we proceeded further with the hearing.\n[410] Dr. Attaran scolded Mr. Stynes for suggesting he be told what position he would have to take. Dr. Attaran went on to again criticize me for my comment about his mannerisms and his way of speaking. He again re-iterated that it seemed to him to be the result of my unconscious racial bias. Dr. Attaran said that I probably regretted saying it and implied that I probably wanted to apologize for saying it. This was the fifth time Dr. Attaran implied or stated that I was racially biased against him.\n[411] Dr. Attaran and the Commission both said they were prepared to continue with the hearing that day. Dr. Attaran wanted to put his allegation of bias aside and continue with his cross-examination of Professor Haan. The hearing was also scheduled to continue on the following week with the testimony of another witness.\n[412] An allegation of bias against a decision-maker, especially in the midst of a hearing, is a matter which must be addressed. I determined that I would need more time to reflect and review the jurisprudence before making a decision. As such, I terminated the hearing that day and we vacated the hearing days for the following week.\n[413] Before describing how the matter was resolved, I feel the need to speak on the record from a personal perspective. Allegations of racial bias are very toxic in today\u2019s world. The mere allegation of such impropriety carries with it significant stigmatization and it is often very difficult for the accused to achieve redemption because the allegation, though difficult to prove, is also quite difficult to disprove. My personal reputation was impugned by Dr. Attaran\u2019s allegation, so I wish to reply to defend myself. Firstly, I do not observe Dr. Attaran to speak with an accent or differently from anyone else in North America. He was born and raised in California and educated and employed at some of the most prestigious universities in the English-speaking world. I have never met Dr. Attaran in person. I have only seen him on a video screen. He does not even appear to me to be a visible minority. Perhaps it might be different in person. I also highly doubt that I have a subconscious bias against people with a Persian ethnic background. Some of my closest friends are from Iran, including my college roommate who has remained a lifelong friend and participated as a groomsman at my wedding. In the absence of a motion for my recusal, I did not view the allegation as being serious. I perceived it more as an attempt to intimidate me, which it did not.\n[414] In the moment of contentious litigation, it is possible for tempers to flare and judgement to be impaired. In the forum of a human rights tribunal hearing, allegations of discrimination are always top of mind, and perhaps this might influence perceptions.\n[415] The Tribunal is sensitive to the fact that Dr. Attaran was self-represented and he was concerned about the need to make timely objections to preserve his rights when he believed they had not been respected. However, there is a distinction to be drawn between, on the one hand, objecting to a course of action adopted\u2014or even a ruling made\u2014by the Tribunal, and on the other hand, impugning the Tribunal\u2019s impartiality and integrity. The latter should not be asserted outside of a recusal request.\n[416] It is well established that in certain contexts, a party must bring a timely objection on an allegation of bias to prevent an assertion of waiver. However, waiver can have no application in cases where the bias allegation is tied to what is said or done during the decision-making process (Rothesay Residents Association Inc. v. Rothesay Heritage Preservation & Review Board et al., 2006 NBCA 61 (CanLII), at para 14).\n[417] Bias is a serious matter. In Arthur v Canada (Attorney General), 2001 FCA 223 at para 8, the Federal Court of Appeal explained that an allegation of bias against a tribunal is a serious allegation that cannot be made lightly. When deployed during the hearing as a simple advocacy tool, allegations of bias undermine the respectful atmosphere that is required for the quasi-judicial process to operate. They inflame the proceedings and distract from the matters to be decided. Because they do not seek a recusal decision from the member, such advocacy allegations erode confidence in the administration of justice since they offer no avenue for either substantiation or dismissal.\n[418] Mr. Stynes described Dr. Attaran\u2019s allegation of bias without a motion for recusal as a \u201csword of Damocles\u201d hanging over the proceeding. In Mr. Stynes\u2019 view, unless fully withdrawn, an allegation of bias would serve as a \u201ctrump card\u201d for Dr. Attaran to play for a judicial review if the final decision herein did not substantiate his complaint. (Hearing Recording at 2:34 on April 30, 2021.)\n[419] The inherent problem with any allegation of unconscious bias is that it is next-to-impossible to prove what is going on inside the mind of another person, especially when part of the argument is that the person is not even aware themself of it. Unconscious bias finds its roots in the implicit-bias test developed by a group of American social psychology researchers around 30 years ago. Despite the wide use of the test for training in the work place, it has been controversial within the scientific community because of its inability to meet the accepted standard of consistent test results, suggesting to many that the implications, insofar as test results may relate to a propensity for discrimination, are not supportable. A bald allegation of unconscious bias made before a Tribunal member should be received in a careful and measured way. While the complainant may argue that the respondent is discriminatory due to the unconscious bias that is unseen, the respondent is equally open to argue that the complainant is delusional and seeing discrimination where it doesn\u2019t exist. Neither of these arguments are helpful to the adjudicator.\n[420] With the hearing suspended indefinitely, I took time to reflect on how the matter could proceed. All parties had invested years of preparation into this inquiry and we had already completed 14 days of hearing. It would be an enormous set-back if a new adjudicator had to be appointed to take over the inquiry.\n[421] After some reflection, I issued a letter to the parties concerning decorum on May 20, 2021, which outlined my expectations for hearing decorum and the good order required to complete the inquiry. The parties referred to these directions as the \u201cDecorum Directives\u201d for the remainder of the hearing. There were several allegations made that parties were breaching the Decorum Directives as we concluded the hearing in September. However, I did not view any breaches as being sufficiently prejudicial as to warrant a further suspension of the proceedings. The inquiry had come so far and was getting close to the end. It needed to reach its conclusion.\n",

Lustig\nContents\nI. Overview 1\nII. Legal Framework 1\nIII. Analysis 2\nIV. Confidentiality Order 3\nI. Overview [1] The Complainant (\u201cGH\u201d) alleges that the Respondent, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (\u201cCSIS\u201d), discriminated against her by providing an unfounded negative reference to a potential future employer, contrary to section 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d). Allegedly, the negative feedback followed a settlement agreement between GH and CSIS from a previous complaint while GH was an employee of CSIS.\n[2] CSIS denies that it has engaged in any form of discrimination, and, in particular, denies that it ever provided a reference or negative feedback to anyone at the potential future employer in relation to GH.\n[3] CSIS has filed a motion under section 52 of the CHRA for a confidentiality order to prevent the public disclosure of the identity of current and past employees of CSIS, as such disclosure puts those individuals at risk, and impairs both the employees\u2019 and CSIS\u2019s ability to investigate threats to the security of Canada. GH and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) have consented to the order being sought by CSIS.\n[4] For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that a confidentiality order on the terms sought is reasonable and necessary and in the interests of justice in the circumstances, as the public disclosure of the confidential information would result in real and substantial risk to matters involving public security, and where there is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered. As such, the motion of CSIS is allowed and a confidentiality order on the terms set out below is issued.\nII. Legal Framework [5] In SM, SV, and JR v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2021 CHRT 35, at paragraphs 5-11, Tribunal Member Paul Singh reviewed section 52 of the CHRA and the required statutory analysis laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in Sherman Estate v. Donovan (\u201cSherman Estate\u201d) for the Tribunal to issue a confidentiality order on a motion under the section 52. The Court set out a three-part test that must be satisfied in order to succeed on a motion seeking a limit on presumptive court openness. It must be established that:\n1) court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest; 2) the order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and 3) as a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects.\nIII. Analysis [6] During the course of these proceedings, the parties intend to call witnesses, including GH, who are or were employees of CSIS and the parties intend to disclose information, including in the pleadings and documentary evidence, which identifies current and past employees of CSIS.\n[7] Disclosure of the information contemplated above through the publicly accessible Tribunal file would be in violation of section 18 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act (\u201cCSIS Act\u201d). Section 18 of the CSIS Act forbids disclosure of the identity of a present or past employee engaged or likely to become engaged in covert operational activities of CSIS or of any information from which identity could be inferred.\n[8] Publicly identifying current and former CSIS employees puts those individuals at risk, and impairs both the employees\u2019 and CSIS\u2019S ability to investigate threats to the security of Canada. Disclosure of the identities of CSIS employees can cause a real and substantial risk to matters involving public security as contemplated under section 52(1)(a) of the CHRA, and also raises a serious possibility that the life, liberty and security of a person will be endangered as set out at section 52(1)(d). Accordingly, a confidentiality order is necessary in the present case.\n[9] The confidentiality terms sought by CSIS are the least obstructive option available that achieves the objectives of protecting the confidential information from disclosure, and Canada\u2019s national security interests, while balancing the public\u2019s interest in an open inquiry. There are no other reasonable alterative terms that could achieve the same goals. The confidentiality terms sought will not prejudice GH in these proceedings, and both GH and the Commission have consented to the confidentiality terms.\n[10] The confidentiality terms sought therefore comply with section 52 of the CHRA and satisfy the three-part Sherman Estate test. Consequently, the motion is allowed and the confidentiality order and terms thereof as set out below is hereby issued.\nIV. Confidentiality Order [11] Any information identifying the complainant or any current or past employee of CSIS (a \u201cConfidential CSIS Employee\u201d) is designated to be confidential information (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d) under section 52 of the CHRA.\n[12] The complainant will be identified only by the pseudonym \u201cGH\u201d in all documents and pleadings filed with the Tribunal, as well as all correspondence between parties and with the Tribunal, and in all Tribunal Rulings and Decisions, until further order of the Tribunal.\n[13] The parties will have 30 days for the Order of the Tribunal to re-file their documents and pleadings with versions that use the pseudonym \u201cGH\u201d. These new documents will replace previous versions.\n[14] Any hard copy documents filed by the parties containing Confidential Information must be placed in a sealed envelope marked confidential and shall not be made part of the public record, provided that a public version of the material from which the Confidential Information is redacted or removed is also filed on the public record.\n[15] The respondent may identify any Confidential CSIS Employee in any document filed with the Tribunal solely and consistently by the same random initials or other pseudonym and must include their position title.\n[16] The parties will have 30 days from the Order of the Tribunal to re-file their documents and pleadings with versions that use pseudonyms, if necessary. These new documents will replace the previous versions.\n[17] At the request of a party or the Commission, the full name of a Confidential CSIS Employee must be disclosed where the position title and other provided information alone are insufficient to identify who the employee is and their involvement in an issue. They must keep the information in confidence an cannot publicize it nor include it with any documentation submitted to the Tribunal.\n[18] All parties must respect the confidentiality of the information by not referring to any Confidential Information publicly or in any public proceedings and by only referring to Confidential CSIS Employees by the random initial or other pseudonyms assigned to them.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

Order 19\nI. Background [1] This is a ruling of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) on a motion by the Complainant and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission) to have measures taken to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry, in accordance with subsection 52(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the CHRA).\n[2] Without entering into all the details, the Complainant asks, because of the domestic violence perpetrated against her by a former partner and the risks to her safety and that of her children, that her name and other personally identifying information be protected.\n[3] As for the Commission, it proposes several specific orders for the Tribunal to make, which can be summarized as follows:\nA publication ban Anonymization of the names of the Complainant, witnesses, geographic locations and personally identifying information Sealing the Tribunal file Filing new, anonymized Statements of Particulars A ban on the disclosure\/distribution of recordings Retention of jurisdiction by the Tribunal over the issue of confidentiality\n[4] The Canada Post Corporation (the \u201cCorporation\u201d or the \u201cRespondent\u201d) opposes the motion. It argues that the motion is premature because it is based on evidence not relevant to the case. It is also of the view that the alleged risk is speculative.\n[5] Moreover, the Corporation argues that if the Tribunal granted the motion, the confidentiality measures requested by the Complainant and the Commission would be too broad and should be strictly limited to anonymizing the Complainant\u2019s address and current geographic location, among other things.\nII. Issue [6] Are there special circumstances allowing the Tribunal to order measures to ensure the confidentiality of the inquiry because of\n-a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry such that the Complainant\u2019s need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public?\n-a real and substantial risk that disclosure of personal or other matters will cause undue hardship to the Complainant such that the need to prevent disclosure outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public? or\n-a serious possibility that the life or security of the Complainant and her children will be endangered?\nIII. Decision [7] For the following reasons, the Tribunal grants the motion in part.\nIV. Analysis [8] The general rule is that judicial proceedings, including those of the Tribunal, are subject to the open courts principle. Section 52 of the CHRA is clear and essentially comes down to this: Tribunal proceedings shall be conducted in public.\n[9] However, the open courts principle is not absolute, and there may be specific cases where measures may be taken to ensure the confidentiality of judicial proceedings where circumstances require it.\n[10] The Tribunal\u2019s case law is consistent in this regard. For such measures to be taken, there must be grounds that justify doing so, in accordance with subsection 52(1) of the CHRA (see for example Woodgate et al. v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2021 CHRT 20 (CanLII); A.B. and Gracie v. Correctional Service Canada, 2022 CHRT 15 (CanLII)).\n[11] Subsection 52(1) of the CHRA sets out these exceptions and establishes the criteria to be met before the Tribunal may order confidentiality measures. They may be summarized as follows:\n-There is a real and substantial risk to public security [paragraph (a)].\n-There is a real and substantial risk to the fairness of the inquiry [paragraph (b)].\n-There is a real and substantial risk that personal or other matters will be disclosed, and their protection outweighs the societal interest that the inquiry be conducted in public [paragraph (c)].\n-There is a serious possibility that the life, liberty or security of a person will be endangered [paragraph (d)].\n[12] In Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25 (CanLII), at paragraph 38, the Supreme Court clarified the three criteria that must be met when analyzing whether court openness may be limited:\n(1) Court openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest.\n(2) The order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent this risk.\n(3) As a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects.\n[13] The Tribunal recently confirmed that the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s amended analysis supports the traditional criteria established by subsection 52(1) of the CHRA (SM, SV and JR v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2021 CHRT 35 (CanLII), at para 8). This therefore means that the analysis under section 52 of the CHRA does not contradict the Supreme Court of Canada.\n[14] Finally, the Tribunal has also stated, in White v. Canadian Nuclear Laboratories Ltd., 2020 CHRT 37 [White], that section 52 of the CHRA requires an analysis that balances the societal interest in open courts with the personal interests of the party requesting that the inquiry be kept confidential, in whole or in part (White, at para 54). In other words, there is a burden of proof to be met before a confidentiality order may be granted.\n[15] As provided by subsection 52(1) of the CHRA, the member must be satisfied that an order is necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the proceeding. As for Sherman, the Supreme Court of Canada reminds us that the confidentiality measure must be necessary to prevent the serious risk in question and that no reasonable alternative measure\u2014in other words, no other, less restrictive measure\u2014can be taken to eliminate that risk.\n[16] Finally, the analysis under section 52 of the CHRA and Sherman immediately rules out cases where confidentiality orders have been requested by a party because this would be helpful or practical, or because the party thinks publicizing the information could be a source of inconvenience and embarrassment. The analysis also rules out situations where all parties consent to the request for confidentiality or where the request is unopposed, but the criteria under section 52 of the CHRA and Sherman have not been met (White, at para 50).\n[17] In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the motion by the Complainant and the Commission complies with paragraphs 52(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the CHRA and with the analysis set out in Sherman, with a few necessary adaptations as to the measures to be taken to weigh the open courts principle against the Complainant\u2019s interests relating to her safety and that of her children. The Tribunal will address a few of the Corporation\u2019s arguments head-on and explain why it disagrees with them.\n[18] The Corporation is of the view that the motion by the Complainant and the Commission is based on the presumption that the Complainant will have to testify regarding the allegations of domestic violence involving her. According to the Corporation, the Complainant has not established the relevance of the information relating to the domestic violence she allegedly suffered.\n[19] The parties have expressly agreed to add sex and family status to the complaint as prohibited grounds of discrimination. The purpose of this addition was to allow the Complainant to argue that gender-based violence, including domestic violence, is a form of discrimination. To this end, she filed an amended Statement of Particulars on December 16, 2021, with the agreement of the parties and the Tribunal, in which she sets out her position in this regard, at paragraph 21.\n[20] It is most surprising to now hear the Corporation argue that neither the Complainant nor the Commission has established the relevance of the allegations of domestic violence. Contrary to what the Corporation argues, the allegations of domestic violence are now laid out in the complaint and are relevant. The Complainant argues, in particular, that when she revealed to her employer, the Corporation, that she was a victim of domestic violence, she experienced differential adverse treatment in the course of her employment and the Corporation did not renew her employment contract.\n[21] The Tribunal also fails to understand the Corporation\u2019s argument that the relevance of the allegations of domestic violence must be decided before the motion for confidentiality and that, for this reason, the motion is premature. The Corporation is needlessly complicating the proceeding, while the complaint, as previously mentioned, concerns in particular the domestic violence suffered by the Complainant, its effects on her employment and the differential adverse treatment she allegedly suffered after revealing this information to her employer.\n[22] It has been clear right from the start of this case that domestic violence is an issue in the complaint and the inquiry into it. The Tribunal does not need to deal with the relevance of these allegations as a preliminary matter since everything is already set out in the Complainant\u2019s amended Statements of Particulars. For this reason, the Tribunal will inevitably have to hear evidence on the domestic violence suffered by the Complainant.\n[23] Similarly, the Corporation also argues that the Complainant and the Commission have not asked the Tribunal to enter the allegations of domestic violence into evidence at this stage of the proceeding. In other words, it claims that the motion for confidentiality is based on elements not yet admitted into evidence that have yet to be established or proved. The Tribunal finds such an argument perplexing.\n[24] As the Tribunal has already mentioned, the allegations of domestic violence are included in the complaint. Now, the Tribunal will have to hear what is ultimately necessary regarding the allegations of domestic violence, which does not open the door to filing evidence that is not relevant or necessary to the complaint. There are limits, as the Corporation argues. The Complainant and the Commission will then be able to concentrate on the aspects of the domestic violence that are necessary to the complaint, and the Tribunal may not necessarily have to accept all the details of the violence the Complainant allegedly suffered.\n[25] That said, the Complainant is not represented by counsel, and the Tribunal is an administrative tribunal that must necessarily be flexible (subsection 48.9(1) of the CHRA). The Tribunal will allow her all the flexibility she needs to testify about her experience so that she can tell her story and relate what she experienced while working for the Corporation. The Tribunal finds that she will inevitably have to talk about her experiences with domestic violence. Now, this situation will not deprive the Corporation of an opportunity to cross-examine the Complainant or to address in its final arguments the weight or relevance to be given to the Complainant\u2019s evidence, just as this does not deprive it of the opportunity to argue that domestic violence is not covered by the CHRA, contrary to what the Complainant and the Commission claim.\n[26] Further, as the Tribunal well knows, motions that are filed before the leading of evidence, which is done at the hearing, are generally based on evidence that has not yet been tested at the hearing, which naturally makes sense. This is why a party will also file certain materials in support of their motion, such as an affidavit. This is exactly what the Complainant did. In this affidavit, which was duly made under oath, the Complainant explains that she is a survivor of domestic violence perpetrated by a former partner and addresses in great detail what she experienced and how this violence affected her and her children.\n[27] To reassure the Corporation, the Tribunal is not, at this stage, going to assess the evidence in the file. The evidence will be led at the hearing. Nor is the Tribunal going to determine whether domestic violence should be covered by the CHRA. The Tribunal will also hear the parties on this subject at the hearing. The purpose of this ruling is aimed solely at determining whether confidentiality measures should be granted to ensure the Complainant\u2019s safety and that of her children.\n[28] At this stage, the Tribunal has an affidavit filed by the Complainant in support of her motion and that of the Commission. The Corporation did not ask to cross-examine the Complainant on this affidavit, which it could have done. Therefore, the Tribunal may rely on the facts provided by the Complainant in her affidavit and may consider them to be true for the purposes of the motion. However, these allegations do not constitute evidence for the hearing. If the Complainant decides to lead the evidence in her affidavit at the hearing, she will have to prove that evidence, and the Tribunal will assess it at the appropriate time. The Corporation, for its part, will have the opportunity to challenge that evidence, for example, by cross-examining the Complainant or arguing the weight or relevance to be given to the evidence.\n[29] Similarly, the Tribunal also disagrees with the Corporation\u2019s argument that the Complainant\u2019s allegations of domestic violence, her fears and the actions she had to take to protect herself and her children are speculative. The same reasons set out above apply in the circumstances. The Complainant filed an affidavit, which was not challenged by the Corporation. Consequently, the fact included in it may be taken as true by the Tribunal, for the purposes of the motion. The Complainant\u2019s affidavit is clear and categorical with regard to the existing real and substantial risks and the lack of reasonable alternative measures to prevent these risks (s. 52(1) of the CHRA and Sherman, mentioned above).\n[30] In her affidavit, the Complainant explains that she is a survivor of domestic violence perpetrated by a former partner and recounts in detail what she experienced. She states she was physically and verbally assaulted and was threatened in person, by telephone, by text and on social media. Her former partner was arrested and charged with several crimes related to domestic violence, but the Complainant later withdrew these charges because of all the pressure she was under. She confirms that he does, however, have a criminal record related to domestic violence against other women.\n[31] The Complainant adds that her former partner admitted to her that he would kill any women who reported him to the police and that he is still wanted by the police for violent acts committed against another woman.\n[32] The Complainant confirms that she has moved several times in recent years because she fears for her life and safety. She has also placed her children in someone else\u2019s care to protect them. She adds that she does not believe that, at present, her former partner knows where she currently lives or has any knowledge of her contact information, including her telephone number, her email address or her social media accounts. The Complainant knows nothing of her former partner\u2019s comings and goings. She is trying, to the extent possible, not to attract his attention and to prevent him from finding her.\n[33] The Complainant argues that she experienced differential adverse treatment by her former employer, the Corporation, in the course of her employment when she revealed to the Corporation that she is a victim of domestic violence. In addition, her employment contract was not renewed. She states that she will testify at the hearing regarding the domestic violence she suffered and its effects on her, her wellbeing, her performance at work and her interactions with her former employer until her employment was terminated.\n[34] She therefore fears the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is public, which includes, for example, future Tribunal rulings that would contain her name, the public notices of hearing on the Tribunal\u2019s website and the fact that this could draw the attention of her former partner, his friends or his relatives. She also fears that her case will attract the attention of the media, which could publish her name and other personal information.\n[35] The Complainant is also aware that some organizations have filed applications with the Tribunal to attend the inquiry as interested persons because of the allegations related to domestic violence. She fears that these organizations\u2019 interest will attract public and media attention to her case.\n[36] She believes that if her former partner learns of her Tribunal proceeding, he could file an access to information request regarding the official record to gain access to the documents in her case. She also believes that he will recognize her voice in the Tribunal\u2019s recordings if he requests access to it.\n[37] She fears for her safety and that of her children if her former partner becomes aware of her allegations of domestic violence. She also dreads the possibility that if her personal information were not protected, he would be able to find her or her children so that he can harm them or extort money from her.\n[38] The Complainant adds that she also wants to testify regarding her friendship with someone close to her former partner who tried to protect her. She states that her former partner is not aware of the friendship between her and this person and that if he finds out about it, he will inevitably come after her.\n[39] Finally, she believes that if her personal information is not protected, she will not feel safe enough to testify freely and candidly before the Tribunal. She fears that her former partner, if he learned of this proceeding, could gain access to information that would allow him to find her or her children. The only solution, as she sees it, if her information is not protected will be to move after the Tribunal hearing, which will have consequences on her life, her finances and her children, among other things.\n[40] The Tribunal is sensitive to the information that the Complainant has provided, and it has enough information to warrant setting up protections to ensure the Complainant\u2019s safety and that of her children under paragraphs 52(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the CHRA. The Complainant\u2019s case is a good example of why section 52 of the CHRA exists.\n[41] The Tribunal acknowledges that domestic violence is a plague to which the justice system must pay special attention. Courts and tribunals necessarily have a role to play in ensuring that victims of domestic violence can feel safe in the judicial proceedings in which they take part. Although there is no such thing as zero risk, we have to try as much as possible to avoid doing anything that could endanger the safety of victims of domestic violence or put them back in a dangerous situation when they must share information regarding their abusers and the violence they experienced.\n[42] According to the allegations made by the Complainant, which include death threats, it is clear that the benefits of protecting the Complainant and her children outweigh the societal interest in holding proceedings in public.\n[43] When the Tribunal must analyze real and substantial risk under subsection 52(1) of the CHRA, this risk must be assessed in light of what could happen. In other words, when the Tribunal weighs the interests of society in holding proceedings in public, it must also consider the existing real and substantial risk if confidentiality measures are not ordered and if this risk should actually materialize.\n[44] In the case at hand, it is not a matter of the Complainant merely fearing embarrassment if her information were to end up in the public domain. Under oath, the Complainant told us about the real and substantial risks to her physical safety and that of her children as well as the potential psychological, emotional and financial harm. The Complainant suffered violence at the hands of her former partner, was threatened and had to hide, change addresses several times and take refuge in a women\u2019s shelter because of this violence and her former partner\u2019s actions. He looked for her, found her and threatened her by telephone, by text message and on social media.\n[45] The Complainant tried, and is still trying, to escape the clutches of her former partner and avoid drawing his attention. The Tribunal is very concerned to hear that the Complainant\u2019s abuser also admitted to her that he would kill any woman who reported him. Those are strong, disturbing words that cannot be ignored.\n[46] The Complainant basically fears for her life should her former partner ever find out about the Tribunal proceedings and learn that she is going to recount what she went through under his yoke. She fears for her safety and that of her children and states that her participation in the hearing would be considerably reduced if her information were not reasonably protected.\n[47] It is with these risks in mind that the Tribunal must assess the motion, and this is all it takes to conclude that orders to protect the Complainant\u2019s identity pursuant to paragraphs 52(1)(b), (c) and (d) of the CHRA are necessary to ensure her protection, her safety and the safety of her children. What the Complainant recounts is not a trivial matter, and we cannot take any chances when someone\u2019s life, their safety and above all the safety of children is at stake.\n[48] Finally, the Corporation filed copies of certain social media accounts of the Complainant in which her full name and her current location allegedly appear. The Corporation argues that photographs of her and her children can be found on the Complainant\u2019s social media accounts, and that there are means of contacting her and sending her messages.\n[49] The Tribunal understands that the Corporation is arguing that the fact that the Complainant\u2019s information can already be found in the public domain and can already be accessed by the public raises doubts as to whether there is a real and substantial risk within the meaning of subsection 52(1) of the CHRA (see for example A.B. and Gracie v. Correctional Service Canada, 2022 CHRT 15, at para 39).\n[50] On this point, the Commission noted that the Complainant has confirmed that the information on her social media accounts is out of date. One need only read the copies taken from the Complainant\u2019s social media accounts and filed by the Corporation to see that the Complainant\u2019s information is from several years ago, while it is now 2023. According to the Commission, the Complainant also confirmed that she no longer lives at the location mentioned on social media. As the Complainant\u2019s social media accounts date back several years, without it being possible to establish whether the information has been updated, and since the Complainant has confirmed that she no longer lives at the places mentioned on social media, the weight to be given to the Corporation\u2019s arguments on this point is considerably reduced. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that there is no reference in her social media accounts to her place of work at the Corporation.\n[51] In addition, the Tribunal agrees with the Commission\u2019s argument that the purpose of a confidentiality order is not to erase all traces of the Complainant\u2019s existence in the public domain. It is not up to the Tribunal to do so, and it has no control over what is already in the public domain. The Tribunal\u2019s role is to determine whether there is a serious risk to the identified interest (Sherman) if the information were disclosed in its own proceeding. In other words, the Tribunal must determine whether disclosing the Complainant\u2019s information in its own proceeding poses a real and substantial risk under subsection 52(1) of the CHRA, and the Tribunal\u2019s answer to this in the circumstances is yes.\n[52] In the case at issue, the real and substantial risk resides in particular in the connections that the Complainant\u2019s former partner may make between her and the personal information found in the public domain because of the proceeding before the Tribunal. The purpose of the confidentiality orders is, among other things, to avoid allowing the former partner to cross-reference enough data to find the Complainant or her children or inspiring in him a desire or intention to try to find her.\n[53] Finally, the Corporation also argued that the measures sought by the Commission and the Complainant are overly broad and should be limited, in particular to the Complainant\u2019s address or her geographical location. The Tribunal finds that it is indeed possible to balance the societal interest in conducting proceedings in public while still adequately protecting the Complainant and her children, particularly with regard to the existing real and substantial risk.\n[54] The Tribunal notes that, in this case, the real and substantial risk relates to possible psychological, emotional and financial violence, in addition to physical violence, including death threats that were made by her former partner against any woman who might report him. Given the existing real and substantial risk and the lack of other measures that could reduce this risk, the Tribunal finds that it must make orders to protect the Complainant and her children, with a few necessary adaptations, to strike a balance with the societal interest that judicial proceedings be conducted in public.\n(i) Anonymization of Proceedings and Protection of Personal Information, Past and Future [55] The first measure, which will offer the Complainant considerable protection, is to anonymize her throughout the entire Tribunal proceeding. Anonymizing the Complainant will considerably reduce the risk that her former partner might connect her with the Tribunal proceeding. Accordingly, anonymizing the proceeding provides in large part the desired protection and will considerably reduce the existing real and substantial risk.\n[56] Therefore, for the purposes of this proceeding, the Complainant will be referred to by the letters K. L. There is no need to protect the Respondent\u2019s identity in the circumstances. The parties will have to file new Statements of Particulars in which they have removed all references to the Complainant\u2019s name and replaced them with the letters K. L. The previous Statements of Particulars will be removed from the Tribunal record and replaced with the new versions.\n[57] The Commission\u2019s request to have the entire Tribunal record to date sealed has been made because it is useful or practical, not out of necessity. There is no justification for such a limitation within the meaning of subsection 52(1) of the CHRA or Sherman. If a request for access to the Tribunal\u2019s official record is made by a member of the public or a media outlet, any reference, past or future, to the Complainant\u2019s name will be replaced with K. L. in all the documents requested, including correspondence, directions and summaries of case management teleconferences, among other things.\n[58] In addition, the Tribunal finds that all personal information relating to K. L. must be protected, which includes her email address, home address, telephone number and other personally identifying information. Accordingly, regarding all documents to be filed in the Tribunal\u2019s official record in future, the parties will have to redact any information that could identify the Complainant, including her email address, home address and telephone number. Should this information have an impact on the evidence, the parties and the Tribunal will explore other solutions, for example, filing unredacted copies of the documents in question that could then be sealed.\n[59] In addition, if a request for access to the Tribunal\u2019s official record is made by a member of the public or a media outlet, any reference, past or future, to this information will also be protected.\n[60] Considering the affidavit filed by the Complainant, the parties\u2019 submissions and the exhibits attached to them, the Tribunal orders that the parties\u2019 submissions and the documents submitted in support of this motion for confidentiality be sealed pursuant to subsection 52(2) of the CHRA.\n[61] Any future decision of the Tribunal, correspondence, emails and case management teleconference summaries will refer to the Complainant with the letters K.L.; this includes rulings related to motions to intervene by third parties.\n[62] Future correspondence from the parties, motions and other documents sent to the Tribunal must not include the Complainant\u2019s name. The Complainant\u2019s name and her personally identifying information will also have to be redacted from the documents that will be filed for the purposes of the hearing.\n[63] In accordance with the Policy on Access to Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Official Records, recordings of case management teleconferences are not part of the Tribunal\u2019s official record and therefore not accessible to all. The Tribunal nonetheless orders a ban on distributing these recordings, since the names of the Complainant, witnesses, geographic locations, etc. have already been mentioned in them. If the parties have already requested access to this teleconference information, the Tribunal prohibits distributing them to anyone.\n(ii) Witnesses\u2019 Names [64] The Tribunal has looked at the Complainant\u2019s witness list and acknowledges that some witnesses could indeed pose certain problems, particularly the name of a member of the Complainant\u2019s family. In addition to this individual\u2019s name posing a problem, it is important to avoid the cross-referencing of information in the public domain, particularly witnesses\u2019 names and their places of work at the Corporation at the time of the alleged events, so that this will not allow the former partner to identify and find her. The Tribunal is also aware that it must avoid triggering a reaction that would push the former partner to try to find the Complainant and her children, given the safety issues in this case.\n[65] Once again, the Tribunal notes that the real and substantial risk in this case is not mere embarrassment should the Complainant\u2019s identity and personal information be disclosed. There are, in our case, risks to the safety of the Complainant and her children, including death threats made by the former partner against any woman who might report him. In an ideal world, the Tribunal proceeding must avoid placing the Complainant and her children back in a dangerous situation.\n[66] To this end, the identities of all the parties\u2019 witnesses will be protected. When the parties file their Statements of Particulars and their witness lists, they will have to identify the witnesses by the initials of their first and last names. The initials of the witnesses\u2019 names must be used in all correspondence, documents and evidence filed in the Tribunal record in future. Witnesses\u2019 names in correspondence with the Tribunal, case management summaries, emails, etc. will be replaced with their initials if a request for access to the record is made.\n[67] As will be discussed below, witnesses\u2019 names may be used in case management teleconferences and at the hearing, under certain conditions, which will be explained below.\n(iii) Geographic Locations [68] The Tribunal finds that there is a real and substantial risk that if the Complainant\u2019s former partner should learn the location of her employment with the Corporation, he might be able to make the connection between her, the Tribunal proceedings and the allegations of domestic violence against him. The objective is in effect to avoid the cross-referencing of information that would allow this man to find the Complainant and her children and trigger in him a desire to find them.\n[69] To balance the Complainant\u2019s request with society\u2019s interest in conducting proceedings in public and in a transparent manner, the Tribunal will avoid referring to the Complainant\u2019s place of work in its final decision. If it must refer to the place of work, it will use the geographic location of the province in question in this case.\n[70] If the parties or the interested persons, as the case may be, must mention a location, the Tribunal asks that they use the geographic location of the province in question in this case.\n[71] As for the Tribunal\u2019s official record to date, if a request for access is made by a member of the public or a media outlet, the Tribunal will remove any references to geographic locations, except for the province.\n[72] When the parties file new versions of their Statements of Particulars, their lists of documents, witnesses\u2019 names, summaries of testimony and all future documents to be filed in the Tribunal\u2019s official record, they will have to remove the geographic locations, except for the province.\n[73] As for the evidence that will be filed at the hearing, the parties and the interested persons, as the case may be, will have to remove all geographic locations mentioned in that evidence, except for the province.\n(iv) Publication Ban [74] Although no media outlets have shown an interest in this proceeding, the Tribunal finds that there is a real and substantial risk\u2014that is, to the safety of the Complainant and that of her children, particularly with regard to the death threats already made by the former partner against women who might report him\u2014and that it is in the interests of the Complainant and her children to protect her personal information. The Tribunal orders a publication ban with regard to the names of the Complainant and her children, their personal information, witnesses\u2019 names and relevant geographic locations, except for the province in question in this case.\n[75] To strike a balance with the societal interest in a public inquiry, and as will be discussed in the next section, members of the public and media outlets will be allowed to watch and listen to the hearing. However, the publication ban will prevent them from disclosing information identified by the Tribunal outside the hearing, to protect the identities of the Complainant and her children.\n(v) Hearing Recordings [76] The Tribunal concludes that there is also a real and substantial risk related to the audio recordings of the hearing being accessible to the former partner, and the risk that he would be able to cross-reference information allowing him to identify the Complainant and track her down. Once again, the risk in this case is significant.\n[77] To strike a balance with the societal interest that proceedings be held in public and to sufficiently protect the Complainant and her children and considering the real and substantial risks in this case, particularly with regard to the death threats that have been made, the Tribunal will allow the public and the media to watch and listen to the hearing, subject to the publication ban in effect.\n[78] At the hearing, to ensure that the Complainant, her witnesses and those of the Corporation can speak freely and that the hearing is conducted as smoothly as possible, the Tribunal will allow all participants to use the names of any persons involved in the proceeding and to refer to geographic locations that are relevant to the inquiry. The Tribunal wants the participants to be able to fully present their evidence, without holding back.\n[79] However, the audio recordings of the hearing will be sealed and thus inaccessible to the public and the media until the Tribunal\u2019s record is destroyed. The names of the Complainant and her children, her personal information, witnesses\u2019 names and the geographic locations relevant to this case, except for the province, are also subject to a publication ban. In other words, no participant in the hearing, member of the public or media outlet may publish this information.\n[80] As for the minutes of the hearing, they will also be accessible to the public and the media (paragraph 47(1)(l) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137), but they will have to abide by the Tribunal\u2019s orders regarding the publication ban, the use of the names of the Complainant, her children and the witnesses and the protection of her personal information and geographic locations.\n[81] The only exception is this: the parties and the interested persons in this case will be able to access the audio recordings, if need be, but are prohibited from distributing such recordings to anyone, apart from reviewing courts should an application for judicial review of the final decision be made.\n(vi) In-Person Hearing [82] The Tribunal finds that another measure to protect the Complainant would be to hold an in-person hearing in federal government offices, at a place to be determined, so that the comings and goings of members of the public can be monitored.\n[83] Unfortunately, virtual hearings do not allow for monitoring as strict as what is possible with in-person hearings. The Tribunal notes that members of the public and the media are prohibited from intervening in the hearing or using their cameras or microphones. Even though the Tribunal has a list of individuals having requested access to its virtual hearings, and even though it may order the exclusion of witnesses, it is more difficult to monitor who is really behind the camera in a virtual setting, compared with an in-person hearing.\n[84] Accordingly, and without ruling on the issue, the Tribunal will propose to the parties that the hearing be held in person, at a place to be determined. This proposal will be discussed with the parties at a later date. The Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the mode of hearing must make sense for the parties and that it may be necessary to accommodate the hearing participants, to the extent possible.\n(vii) Retention of Jurisdiction and Applicability of Orders [85] The Commission\u2019s request for the Tribunal to retain its jurisdiction over the issue of confidentiality is unnecessary. Similarly, the Tribunal does not need to order that its orders remain applicable even after the case ends.\n[86] The Tribunal\u2019s orders apply in the case\u2019s past, present and future up to the destruction of the Tribunal\u2019s official record in accordance with its policies in this regard. The Tribunal may make orders to ensure confidentiality measures are maintained without having to mention that they remain in force despite the inquiry being over. Such an order is therefore unnecessary.\n[87] As for retaining jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that it retains full jurisdiction over its proceedings so long as the inquiry is still in progress and the Tribunal has not disposed of the complaint. Once the complaint file is closed and the Tribunal has exhausted its mandate under the CHRA, its jurisdiction is extinguished (functus officio).\n[88] Except in exceptional circumstances, as the Supreme Court established in Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects, 1989 CanLII 41 (SCC), [1989] 2 SCR 848, regarding the concept of functus officio, which also applies to administrative decision-makers, the Tribunal cannot revisit final decisions it has rendered once it has fulfilled its mandate and carried out its purpose under the CHRA.\n[89] Accordingly, I do not agree to retain jurisdiction over the issue of confidentiality for the future, which, in other words, means that the Tribunal would not leave the door open to dealing with confidentiality in this case, after the complaint has been disposed of and a final decision has been rendered.\n[90] However, the parties may still submit additional confidentiality-related requests during the proceeding, if necessary, or ask the Tribunal to reconsider certain orders during the proceeding if there are grounds or special circumstances that warrant reconsidering this order.\nV. Order [91] To sum up, the Tribunal issues the following orders, which must be read in light of the reasons given in this ruling for more details.\n[92] Anonymization of the Complainant and the protection of her personal information:\nThroughout the proceeding, the Complainant must be identified by the letters K. L. Throughout the proceeding, the Complainant\u2019s personal information, which includes in particular her email address, her home address, her telephone number and other personally identifying information, will be protected. Regarding any future documents filed in the Tribunal record, the parties must redact any information identifying the Complainant, in particular her email address, her home address, her telephone number and other personally identifying information. In case of a request to access the Tribunal\u2019s official record, any past or future reference to the Complainant\u2019s name will be replaced with K. L., and any other personal information in the requested documents, which could include correspondence, directions and summaries of case management teleconferences, will be protected. Submissions and exhibits relating to this decision will be sealed under subsection 52(2) of the CHRA. All of the Tribunal\u2019s future decisions, correspondence, emails and case management teleconference summaries will refer to the Complainant by the letters K. L. Recordings of case management conferences will be sealed and remain inaccessible. If the parties have already received copies of these recordings, they are prohibited from distributing them.\n[93] Anonymization of witnesses:\nThe identities of the parties\u2019 witnesses will be protected. In the parties\u2019 statements of particulars and their witness lists, the witnesses\u2019 names must be replaced with the first letters of their first and last names. The initials of the witnesses\u2019 names must be used in all correspondence, documents, evidence or other documents filed in the Tribunal record in future. If a request for access to the Tribunal\u2019s official record is made, the names of witnesses in the Tribunal\u2019s correspondence, case management summaries, emails, etc. will be replaced with the initials of their first and last names.\n[94] Geographic locations:\nIn pleadings and related documents, geographic locations must be protected, and only the name of the province may be used. Regarding the Tribunal\u2019s record to date, if a request for access to the record is made, geographic locations will be removed, except for the province. Regarding future documents to be filed in the Tribunal\u2019s record, which includes the parties\u2019 new statements of particulars, witness lists, summaries of testimony, the evidence presented at the hearing or other documents, geographic locations appearing in them, except for the province, must be protected.\n[95] Publication ban:\nPublishing the names of the Complainant and her children, her personal information, the names of witnesses and relevant geographic locations, except for the name of the province, is prohibited.\n[96] Audio recordings of the hearing and minutes:\nAudio recordings of the hearing will be sealed and remain inaccessible to anyone, except for the parties and the interested persons, as the case may be, and they will be prohibited from distributing them, except to reviewing courts in case of judicial review. The minutes of the hearing will also be available to the public and the media; however, the Complainant will be referred to by the initials K. L., witnesses will be referred to by the initials of their first and last names, and the Complainant\u2019s personal information, her children\u2019s names and geographic locations, except for the province, will be protected.\n[97] Public and media participation at the hearing:\nThe hearing will be open to the public, subject to the publication ban. The names of the Complainant and her children and geographic locations may be used at the hearing, subject to the ban on publication outside the hearing.\nSigned by\nGabriel Gaudreault\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 7, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T2664\/4021\nStyle of Cause: K.L. v.

Order 21\nI. Overview and Decision [1] Annie Oleson was an Elder and a member of the Respondent Wagmatcook First Nation when she filed her human rights complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) in 2014. Her complaint alleges that Wagmatcook discriminated against her on the basis of disability when it failed to provide her with accessible, barrier free housing, contrary to sections 5 and 6 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 [CHRA].\n[2] On December 28, 2016 the Commission asked the Tribunal to inquire into Ms. Oleson\u2019s complaint. Sadly, Ms. Oleson passed away in February of 2017. The Estate of Annie Oleson is the Complainant in this matter now. Ms. Oleson\u2019s son Joseph Oleson represents the Estate.\n[3] Since early 2018, the Tribunal has been dealing with this complaint through its Case Management process. This process involves the exchange of Statements of Particulars, witness lists and arguably relevant documents, as well as resolving issues to ensure the hearing of the complaint can occur as expeditiously as possible.\n[4] The Tribunal has held over fifteen Case Management Conference Calls (CMCC) with the parties and has also issued two Rulings. One Ruling is about the scope of the complaint (2019 CHRT 35 (CanLII)) and the other relates to the types of remedies the Tribunal may award even though the Complainant Ms. Oleson is deceased (2020 CHRT 29 (CanLII)).\n[5] Wagmatcook and the Commission also signed Minutes of Settlement regarding the public interest issues and remedies the Commission was pursuing in respect of this complaint. Ms. Oleson\u2019s Estate is not a party to those Minutes of Settlement. The parties did make efforts to settle the individual aspect of the complaint through two Tribunal-assisted mediations, but no settlement was reached.\n[6] A hearing into the complaint, expected to last three weeks, has been scheduled three times. Each time Mr. Oleson has asked for an adjournment, for various reasons. The last time the Tribunal agreed to adjourn the hearing, Mr. Oleson was directed to provide certain information to the Tribunal and the parties by May 30, 2022. He was warned that, if he did not provide the required information by this date, the Respondent could file a Motion to dismiss the complaint. Mr. Oleson failed to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s direction and the Respondent brought this Motion asking that the complaint be dismissed.\n[7] Wagmatcook says Mr. Oleson has repeatedly failed to comply with the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137 [Rules of Procedure] and the Tribunal\u2019s orders and directions, and that he has demonstrated a wholesale disregard for the Respondent\u2019s procedural fairness rights. It argues that allowing this claim to continue would constitute an abuse of process.\n[8] Mr. Oleson disagrees that the complaint should be dismissed. The Commission takes no position with respect to Wagmatcook\u2019s Motion to dismiss the complaint.\n[9] I agree with Wagmatcook that Mr. Oleson\u2019s conduct, including his non-compliance with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules, timelines and directions, and the delay this has led to, constitutes an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process. I grant Wagmatcook\u2019s request to dismiss the complaint.\nII. Issue [10] There is only one issue to decide in this Decision: does Mr. Oleson\u2019s failure to meet the Tribunal\u2019s deadlines and follow its directions and Rules of Procedure warrant the dismissal of this complaint?\nIII. Analysis A. Submissions of the Parties (i) Respondent\u2019s Motion [11] Wagmatcook moves to dismiss this complaint pursuant to section 9 of the Rules of Procedure, which grants the Tribunal the authority to dismiss complaints for non-compliance with the Rules, or with a Tribunal order or a time limit established under the Rules. Wagmatcook also notes that the Tribunal, like a Court, is \u201centitled to prevent abuse of its process\u201d (Johnston v CAF, 2007 CHRT 42 (CanLII) [\u201cJohnston\u201d] at para 31) and refers to section 10 of the Rules of Procedure, which allows the Tribunal to dismiss a complaint for abuse of its process.\n[12] Wagmatcook says the Tribunal should dismiss this complaint because the Complainant\u2019s representative Mr. Oleson has repeatedly failed to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and its orders and directions. It argues that allowing this claim to continue would result in an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process.\n[13] With regard to what might be described as the triggering events for this Motion, the Respondent says it was in the final stages of preparing for a three-week hearing scheduled to start on April 25, 2022 when the hearing was cancelled for the third time. In its April 21, 2022 decision granting Mr. Oleson\u2019s request to adjourn the hearing, the Tribunal directed Mr. Oleson to provide information regarding the course of his ongoing medical treatment by May 30, 2022. Although he was reminded of this deadline by the Tribunal on May 26, 2022, the May 30 deadline passed without any update from Mr. Oleson or any explanation about why the information was not forthcoming.\n[14] Wagmatcook submits that, as Mr. Oleson\u2019s failure to comply with the May 30 deadline is only the most recent example of his disregard for the Tribunal\u2019s process and the Respondent\u2019s rights, this Motion should be evaluated in the context of the entire proceeding and all parties\u2019 actions relating to the conduct of the proceeding.\n[15] The Respondent says that, in addition to his three requests to adjourn the hearing, Mr. Oleson has rarely met deadlines and has had them extended many times, for example: to file his Statement of Particulars, witness lists and will-say statements; to reply to motions; to provide disclosure to the Respondent; and to provide his comments or approval regarding the Joint Book of Documents and Agreed Statement of Facts prepared by the Commission. The Respondent says each delay has caused the process to expand over years, adversely affecting its procedural fairness and resources, and the integrity of the process.\n[16] Wagmatcook notes that the Tribunal has developed two approaches or tests to apply when determining applications to dismiss complaints for delay or a failure to comply with deadlines. The Tribunal decides which test is appropriate depending on the circumstances of the case (see Johnston at paras 29-31 and Chisholm v HEA, 2019 CHRT 38 (CanLII) [\u201cChisholm\u201d] at paras 17-19). These tests are referred to in the Tribunal\u2019s case law as the \u201cclassic test\u201d and the Seitz test. Only one of these two tests has to be met to dismiss a matter for delay.\n[17] The Respondent acknowledges that the bar is high to dismiss a complaint due to delay or failure to comply with deadlines, \u201cparticularly in the case of an unrepresented complainant who has had significant medical issues\u201d (Chisholm at para 2). However, it argues that, in this case, the bar has been met and surpassed. Wagmatcook further argues that both the \u201cclassic\u201d test and the Seitz test have been met in this case.\n[18] In order to determine whether to dismiss a matter for delay using the \u201cclassic test\u201d, the Tribunal must determine: (1) whether there has been an inordinate delay; (2) whether the delay is inexcusable; and (3) whether the Respondent is likely to be seriously prejudiced by the delay (see Chisholm at para 18). The Respondent submits that all three parts are met in this case.\n[19] First, it says that the delay in dealing with the complaint has been inordinate. It says Mr. Oleson\u2019s conduct has caused numerous and significant delays. Not only has the matter been adjourned three times at his request, but the proceedings have been unreasonably extended as a result of his non-responsiveness and late responses.\n[20] Second, Wagmatcook argues that the delay is not excusable. Mr. Oleson has provided a variety of reasons for his requested adjournments and failures to meet deadlines. However, many of his instances of non-compliance with the Rules or with Tribunal directions have been without any explanation or were otherwise unsupported by credible and reliable documentation.\n[21] Third, the Respondent argues that it has been enormously prejudiced by Mr. Oleson\u2019s conduct throughout the course of the complaint. Wagmatcook has retained legal counsel and says it has incurred the cost of preparing for a lengthy and complex hearing three separate times, in addition to the time and cost of responding to Mr. Oleson\u2019s many other requests. It says: \u201cDue to Mr. Oleson\u2019s unpredictable behaviour and repeated failure to adhere to deadlines and obligations, the Respondent has been left in a prolonged state of uncertainty. It is unclear when or if this claim will be heard on its merits and, even if so, many details of Mr. Oleson\u2019s proposed claims are still unknown to the Respondent, including whether it will be possible for a hearing to proceed (including via videoconference), and what, if any, witnesses will be participating.\u201d\n[22] The Respondent also argues that the Seitz test applies. When applying that test (set out in Seitz v Canada, 2002 FCT 456 (CanLII) [\u201cSeitz\u201d] at paragraphs 16-18), the Tribunal has to consider whether there has been \u201cwholesale disregard\u201d for the Tribunal\u2019s time limits and Rules in cases that have remained static for an unreasonable length of time and where the complainant appears to have no intent to bring the case to a conclusion (see Chisholm at para19).\n[23] The Respondent argues that Mr. Oleson has clearly demonstrated a \u201cwholesale disregard\u201d for the Tribunal\u2019s process which amounts to an abuse of the administration of justice and has affected the Respondent\u2019s right to procedural fairness. It submits that the Tribunal has made significant efforts to accommodate Mr. Oleson throughout this process but, despite the many adjournments and extensions he has been granted, he has failed to adhere to the deadlines and directions given by the Tribunal.\n[24] The Respondent argues that Mr. Oleson has not demonstrated that he is willing to diligently pursue his case. It says that, \u201cto continue litigation with no intention to bring it to a conclusion can amount to an abuse of process\u201d (Seitz at para 19).\n[25] While the Respondent sympathizes with Mr. Oleson\u2019s health challenges, it notes that he has also not been diligent in pursuing his own healthcare. At the time the Respondent filed its Motion to dismiss on June 1, 2022, it was still unknown if Mr. Oleson had attended his mental healthcare appointment on May 25, which was the premise for the April 2022 hearing adjournment. It argues that, even amidst the challenges of ongoing health treatments, Mr. Oleson must take reasonable steps to participate in the Tribunal\u2019s process and move the complaint forward.\n(ii) Complainant [26] Mr. Oleson sent two different emails in relation to the Respondent\u2019s Motion. Neither replies to the Motion in any substantive way.\n[27] The first email was sent on June 17, 2022, which was the Complainant\u2019s deadline to reply to the Motion. Mr. Oleson confirms that he attended his May 25, 2022 appointment and says he attended a follow up appointment on June 14, 2022. He says both of these appointments were with a counselor, who was scheduling an appointment for him to see a psychiatrist in the near future.\n[28] Mr. Oleson also submitted what he describes as a \u201creferral by a clinical therapist from July 31st 2019 stating I was having PTSD like symptoms and still am having PTSD like symptoms\u201d. The July 31, 2019 letter is from a therapist who says he met with Mr. Oleson twice in July of 2019. The therapist says that he would like to continue seeing Mr. Oleson on a regular basis and that they planned to attend a telepsychiatry appointment at the Cape Breton Regional Hospital together \u201cfor a medication consultation and\/or best practices with regard to PTSD like symptoms\u201d.\n[29] Mr. Oleson says in his June 17, 2022 email that he has been and presently is under medical treatment for anxiety. He says PTSD is an anxiety disorder and that he was referred to a psychiatrist for treatment for PTSD a couple of times before the Covid-19 pandemic, but that neither of the psychiatrists he was referred to was taking new patients. He says he will provide the Tribunal with the name of the psychiatrist he will be seeing once he knows this. However, he refuses to provide this information to the Respondent because the Respondent\u2019s counsel contacted his physician about whether he wrote an April 12, 2022 letter in support of Mr. Oleson\u2019s hearing adjournment request. Mr. Oleson describes this action as \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201ca reprehensible violation of my privacy\u201d which has had a \u201cnegative affect (sic) on my health care workers and our relationships.\u201d\n[30] Mr. Oleson then says he will be asking for an investigation of harassment of witnesses having to do with this human rights case and says he will be sending evidence of this alleged harassment shortly.\n[31] Finally, in his June 17, 2022 email submission, Mr. Oleson says that, in the winter of 2021, he was attacked in his children\u2019s home while he was working on his mother\u2019s human rights case. He describes this as \u201ca home invasion that turned bloody\u201d and says this added to his stress and anxiety. He further attached to his June 17, 2022 email some photos of injuries he says he incurred after being attacked at a pizza parlor with his family. He felt this attack had to do \u201cwith a set up because of the Human Rights complaint.\u201d He does not say when this event happened.\n[32] In addition to the June 17, 2022 submissions, Mr. Oleson also sent an unsolicited email on June 27, 2022. The Respondent had the opportunity to respond to this email, so I will summarize it here. Mr. Oleson said he was actively looking into his appointment with a psychiatrist and reiterated that he would only provide their name to the Tribunal and not to the Respondent.\n[33] Mr. Oleson also reiterated that he was going to send some evidence \u201cfor filing a witness intimidation and harassment investigation complaint\u201d and asked for some \u201cleeway concerning admitting evidence\u201d due to his \u201clack of legal knowledge\u201d and his \u201cpsychological health issues\u201d. He repeated his belief that he and his family had been attacked and harassed in relation to the human rights complaint and that these events have had a detrimental impact on his mental health. He attached to this email some photos he says are from the \u201chome invasion\u201d that occurred while he was working on his human rights case, but that he did not want shared with the Respondent.\n(iii) Respondent\u2019s Reply\n[34] The Respondent replied to Mr. Oleson\u2019s June 17 and June 27 emails. It says that despite telling the Tribunal he attended his May 25, 2022 appointment and a June 14 follow up appointment, he has not provided any supporting documentation to confirm his attendance or the recommended next steps, including a treatment plan. The Respondent says no timeline has been proposed on which the Tribunal and Respondent can meaningfully rely.\n[35] In the absence of such information, the Respondent asserts that its procedural fairness rights are significantly compromised. There is no indication as to how or when this matter will move forward and no assurance as to whether Wagmatcook will be forced to continue incurring significant costs associated with further delays.\n[36] With regard to the July 31, 2019 letter from the clinical therapist provided by Mr. Oleson with his June 17, 2022 email, the Respondent points out that the letter recommends he continue with clinical therapy on a regular basis and based on his own submissions, it appears he did not do so. The Respondent submits that this failing shows a lack of diligence on Mr. Oleson\u2019s part in pursuing his own mental health treatment.\n[37] The Respondent says the information about attacks against Mr. Oleson and his family and suggestions that the Respondent was somehow involved are not relevant to the Motion to dismiss and have no place in response submission. Wagmatcook denies the allegations of witness intimidation or harassment, the particulars of which have not been provided by Mr. Oleson.\n[38] Wagmatcook submits that Mr. Oleson continued to disregard procedural fairness requirements and the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure by failing to copy the Respondent on his June 27, 2022 correspondence and by attaching photos that he intends to rely on as part of the complaint that were not disclosed as part of the hearing preparation.\n[39] The Respondent argues that Mr. Oleson has not demonstrated any intention to bring this matter to a conclusion. Instead, he continues to say he has more evidence forthcoming. Wagmatcook reiterates that, to continue litigation with no intention to bring it to a conclusion can amount to an abuse of process (Seitz at para 19).\n[40] The Respondent submits that Mr. Oleson\u2019s submissions fail to provide any path forward for the litigation and that he continues to employ delay tactics which have caused significant harm to the Respondent to this point.\nB. Reasons For Dismissing the Complaint [41] I am of the view that the Tribunal should apply the Seitz approach to determine whether to dismiss this complaint. While the Respondent argues that there has been inordinate delay in this case such that the \u201cclassic test\u201d could also be applied to the facts, I do not agree that this is the appropriate approach to apply in the circumstances of this case.\n[42] The \u201cclassic test\u201d requires a finding that there has been inordinate delay. The Tribunal may need to consider \u2013 in the appropriate case \u2013 whether the \u201cclassic test\u201d still applies, given the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decision in Law Society of Saskatchewan v Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29 (CanLII) [\u201cAbrametz\u201d], which was issued following the Respondent\u2019s final submissions relating to its Motion. In Abrametz, the Supreme Court considered the issue of inordinate delay in administrative proceedings, which the Court had previously considered in Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44 (CanLII). In both cases the Supreme Court endorsed a three-step test to determine whether delay that has not affected the fairness of a hearing nonetheless amounts to an abuse of process. That test is slightly different from the \u201cclassic test.\u201d\n[43] In any event, the present Motion is more about the Complainant\u2019s failure to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and directions than it is about the case taking a very long time in the Tribunal\u2019s process. To the extent that there is no end in sight to this proceeding, due to Mr. Oleson\u2019s conduct, there likely could be an eventual finding of inordinate delay. However, the abuse of process that has occurred in this case is distinct from that alleged in Abrametz (and I note that the Supreme Court found the delay in that case to be long but not inordinate).\n[44] The Seitz approach requires the Tribunal to find that that there has been \u201cwholesale disregard\u201d for the Tribunal\u2019s time limits and Rules of Procedure, in a case that has remained static for an unreasonable length of time, and that the Complainant appears to have no intention of bringing the case to a conclusion. This test is appropriate given that this Motion has been brought pursuant to section 9 of the Rules of Procedure. Section 9 grants the Tribunal the authority to dismiss complaints for non-compliance with the Rules, or with a Tribunal order or a time limit established under the Rules.\n(i) Wholesale disregard for the Tribunal\u2019s time limits and Rules [45] In accordance with section 2(2) of the Rules, all parties have consented to the Tribunal\u2019s 2021 Rules of Procedure applying to this case. Section 5 states that the \u201cRules are to be interpreted and applied so as to secure the informal, expeditious and fair determination of every inquiry on its merits.\u201d This section reflects the legislative requirement that proceedings before the Tribunal \u201cbe conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow\u201d (section 48.9(1) of the CHRA).\n[46] The Rules of Procedure also state that the Tribunal controls the conduct of the inquiry, from case management to motions to the hearing (section 3(2)), and they provide the Tribunal with the authority to establish time limits in order to keep the process moving forward to a hearing. As such, all time limits imposed by the Tribunal in relation to case management, motions and hearing preparation are established under the Rules, for the purposes of section 9.\n[47] Throughout the five years that this matter has been in the Tribunal\u2019s Case Management process, Mr. Oleson has failed to comply with directions and has either missed, or requested extensions of, nearly all of the timelines established by the Tribunal pursuant to its Rules of Procedure. In addition, each time the complaint has been scheduled for a hearing, Mr. Oleson has asked for an adjournment. The following facts relating to Mr. Oleson\u2019s conduct since the matter was first scheduled for a hearing support a finding that Mr. Oleson has exhibited wholesale disregard for the Tribunal\u2019s timelines and Rules of Procedure.\n[48] In April of 2021, Mr. Oleson asked to adjourn the June 2021 hearing dates because he was scheduled to have surgery in May of 2021, and he said he would require time to recover from the surgery. He asked to reschedule the hearing to the fall of 2021. Mr. Oleson agreed to provide confirmation of his surgery date and recovery time from his surgeon or doctor by April 16, 2021. However, he did not provide this information until late April. Once this information was received, all parties consented to adjourn the hearing and the hearing dates were rescheduled for October and November of 2021.\n[49] At the next CMCC in July of 2021, Mr. Oleson advised that he had not yet had his surgery, although he was not responsible for the delay. In order to be ready to begin the hearing in October of 2021, Mr. Oleson was given a deadline of August 25, 2021 to request any further disclosure of documents from the Respondent, and to provide his own remaining documents, photos or videos to the Respondent and Commission. Instead, he waited until his deadline of August 25 to request a three-week extension because he was \u201cvery sick.\u201d He was granted an extension and was given a new, peremptory, deadline of September 8, 2021. The Tribunal stressed to Mr. Oleson that any delays so close to the hearing date have an effect on the ability of the other parties to prepare for the hearing.\n[50] Mr. Oleson had not provided a doctor\u2019s note in support of his August 25, 2021 extension request. As this was not the first time he had indicated that health issues were preventing him from meeting deadlines, the Tribunal directed that any further requests for extensions or delays by Mr. Oleson that were based on illness would only be considered if they were supported by medical documentation.\n[51] On September 8, 2021 Mr. Oleson made a very broad and lengthy request for further information and documents from the Respondent, some of which related to matters outside of the scope of the complaint, an issue that had been decided by the Tribunal in 2019 (in 2019 CHRT 35 (CanLII)).\n[52] As part of his September 8, 2021 request, Mr. Oleson also asked that all disclosure that had been provided to him previously by the other parties be re-sent to him. This was the second time he had made a request to be provided with disclosure he had already received. In addition, Mr. Oleson added several new witnesses to his witness list and said he still had videos and other disclosure that he intended to provide later, despite being ordered to provide all such information by September 8, 2021.\n[53] As a result of this lengthy request from Mr. Oleson so close to the hearing, the Respondent requested to vacate the October hearing dates to allow it to respond, while keeping the week in November of 2021 for the hearing. This was agreed to by all parties and the Tribunal. The Respondent acted diligently and quickly to respond to Mr. Oleson\u2019s request.\n[54] The next CMCC was scheduled for October 13, 2021. Mr. Oleson did not join the call and when contacted by the Tribunal\u2019s Registry Officer, he advised that he did not feel well and would not be calling in. The CMCC was rescheduled to October 15, 2021.\n[55] During the October 15 CMCC, Mr. Oleson asked to adjourn the November 2021 hearing dates. He said he had been having a hard time preparing for the hearing because he had anxiety and PTSD, although he failed to provide medical documentation in support of this assertion as required. At this time, he assured everyone on the call that he was feeling better and was in a position to get everything ready for a hearing in mid-January of 2022.\n[56] The other issue he raised in support of his request to adjourn the hearing was the fact that the Commission had recently indicated it was no longer going to participate in the hearing of the complaint. Up until that point the Commission had been participating as a full party and planned to assist Mr. Oleson with his examination in chief, as well as to cross-examine the Respondent\u2019s witnesses. The Commission had also planned to call four witnesses of its own. The Commission\u2019s late withdrawal from the hearing meant more responsibility was placed on Mr. Oleson\u2019s shoulders that he was not prepared for. Although the Respondent was frustrated with his delays, it noted that he was obviously not ready to proceed in November with the hearing.\n[57] The Commission and Respondent both expressed their concerns about Mr. Oleson\u2019s commitment to the process. They noted that he had been repeatedly unprepared during the case preparation process, had missed deadlines and had asked for multiple extensions. They also questioned whether Mr. Oleson had the documents that had been disclosed to him by the other parties at various times during the Case Management process even though they had sent their documents to him more than once.\n[58] Although they were no longer participating in the hearing, the Commission\u2019s legal counsel were still providing some assistance to the parties by preparing a Joint Book of Documents, as well as an Agreed Statement of Facts. The Commission indicated that, while the Joint Book of Documents was ready, Mr. Oleson continued to take issue with the disclosure provided by the Respondent and he was still talking about expanding the scope of the complaint, even though that issue was decided by the Tribunal in 2019. The Commission suggested that, if the hearing was adjourned, Mr. Oleson\u2019s further deadlines should be peremptory.\n[59] I agreed that the case was taking a very long time to be heard and that it was unfair to the Respondent to have to prepare for the hearing only to face uncertainty about whether Mr. Oleson would be ready. I acknowledged that much of the delay to that point was attributable to Mr. Oleson. However, I understood that the Commission\u2019s withdrawal at this late date placed considerable responsibility and pressure on Mr. Oleson that he was not prepared for.\n[60] At the October 15, 2021 CMCC, I agreed to adjourn the November 2021 hearing dates on the condition that Mr. Oleson must be ready by January of 2022 to proceed to hearing, meaning he must have resolved all of his outstanding issues by then. I established November 2021 deadlines for Mr. Oleson to comply with regarding disclosure. I agreed that these and any future deadlines would be peremptory on Mr. Oleson, meaning he must meet the deadlines established to ensure he would be ready for the hearing and if he did not, he would have to proceed anyway without further extensions. He was warned that he might also face a Motion to dismiss by the Respondent if he continued to fail to meet deadlines and to follow the Tribunal\u2019s directions. Finally, I reiterated that any further health-related delays would only be considered if Mr. Oleson provided medical proof and support for such a request.\n[61] During the October 15, 2021 CMCC the parties also discussed the possibility of another Tribunal-assisted mediation process with a different Tribunal Member. To avoid further delay, I required Mr. Oleson to advise the other parties by October 22 if he agreed to try mediation again. However, he did not meet this deadline. Rather, on November 8 he stated that he had not ruled out the possibility of trying mediation again.\n[62] On November 8, 2021 Mr. Oleson asked for an extension of at least a month and a half to meet the November deadlines established at the October 15 CMCC. He stated that he was dealing with another legal case relating to his mother, that he had his own court case coming up, and that he needed to request more of his mother\u2019s medical records from a hospital for her human rights case.\n[63] On November 10, 2021 I declined to grant Mr. Oleson\u2019s extension request, stating: \u201cThe parties and Tribunal have heard Mr. Oleson make many excuses over the last nearly four years about why he has not met deadlines or why he cannot proceed within timelines he previously agreed to. He needs to start taking this case more seriously and make it a priority.\u201d I stated that if he failed to meet the deadlines established at the October 15, 2021 CMCC, he would not be permitted to ask for further documents from the Respondent or to disclose any further documents himself without the Tribunal\u2019s permission, which would only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\n[64] At a CMCC in February of 2022, while the mediation was ongoing with a different Tribunal Member, hearing dates were scheduled in case the mediation was not successful. The hearing was scheduled to start on April 25, 2022.\n[65] As the matter did not settle, a CMCC was held on April 6, 2022 to ensure the parties were prepared for the hearing. At this CMCC, Mr. Oleson asked to adjourn the hearing dates. During the CMCC he mentioned an upcoming appointment with a psychologist that he felt he needed to attend before he could proceed with the hearing because he was experiencing various mental health issues that were impacting his ability to prepare for the hearing. I indicated that I would not consider a request to adjourn the hearing without medical evidence from a physician, which accords with my previous directions of August and October of 2021 requiring Mr. Oleson to provide medical documentation to support any further health-related adjournment or extension requests.\n[66] On Saturday, April 16, 2022, Mr. Oleson sent an email to the Tribunal and Commission only, requesting an adjournment of the April 25 hearing until after his appointment with a psychologist on May 25, 2022. He did not send his request to the Respondent as required. As a result, the Respondent did not receive his email until April 19. The request was accompanied by a letter from his physician dated April 12, 2022.\n[67] The physician\u2019s letter says he had referred Mr. Oleson to the Nova Scotia Health Authority (NSHA) in April of 2021 because he was presenting with PTSD symptoms. Mr. Oleson also provided a letter from the NSHA dated saying this referral had been closed because the NSHA had been unable to reach Mr. Oleson, but that he could contact them for service without a further referral. It appears that Mr. Oleson did not do this. Instead, his physician referred him to the NSHA again on March 11, 2022, and an appointment was scheduled for May 25, 2022.\n[68] The April 12, 2022 physician\u2019s letter says that Mr. Oleson was \u201cpresently being treated for stress and anxiety and it is my strong recommendation as a Physician that he be granted an extension on his Human Rights hearing that was dated and scheduled for April 25th, 2022. Until after his appointment with a Psychologist on May 25th, 2022, so that you may better understand and accommodate his disability\u201d [as written].\n[69] Mr. Oleson\u2019s April 16, 2022 adjournment request noted that, although he had been able to participate in mediation calls over the past several weeks, he was asking the Tribunal to adjourn the hearing to after May 25 so he could have the \u201ctools\u201d to allow him to proceed, and so the Tribunal could accommodate his disability.\n[70] I agreed to adjourn the hearing based on Mr. Oleson\u2019s letter from his physician. I accepted that Mr. Oleson had the support of his doctor, who strongly recommended the hearing be adjourned to allow him to seek treatment. However, I also agreed with the Respondent\u2019s submission that it did not appear that Mr. Oleson had been diligently pursuing mental health care over the past year despite having been initially referred by his doctor in April of 2021.\n[71] I noted in my decision to adjourn that Mr. Oleson had sought many extensions from the Tribunal over more than four years of Case Management as well as three adjournments, and that he had presented many excuses for his delays which had caused frustration for all involved. I stated that he had little regard for the time and expense required of the Respondent each time it had to prepare for a hearing, only to have it adjourned. I pointed out that, when the Tribunal and counsel set aside three weeks in their calendars for this hearing, we cannot schedule anything else, which affects other parties before the Tribunal as well.\u201d I quoted Constantinescu v Correctional Service Canada, 2018 CHRT 10 (CanLII) [\u201cConstantinescu\u201d] in which the Tribunal stated: \u201cThe more time that passes, the greater the prejudice for the public. It is not in the public interest for complaints related to discrimination to remain unresolved over a long period of time\u201d (para 38).\n[72] I agreed to adjourn the April and May 2022 hearing dates but said that, if further delays were caused by Mr. Oleson\u2019s failure to participate in his own healthcare, he could expect a motion to dismiss to be filed by the Respondent. Mr. Oleson was directed to confirm with the Tribunal and Respondent by May 30, 2022 that he had attended his May 25, 2022 appointment and advise whether he had a follow up appointment scheduled and, if so, advise of the date of the appointment.\n[73] After I issued my decision to adjourn on April 21, 2022, the Respondent\u2019s counsel advised that she had contacted Mr. Oleson\u2019s physician when she realized that his April 12, 2022 letter was not on letterhead and that his name was misspelled. Although they did not discuss Mr. Oleson\u2019s healthcare, the doctor told counsel that Mr. Oleson had presented him with the April 12 letter already typed up and he just signed it.\n[74] In responding to counsel\u2019s concern about the physician\u2019s letter, I noted that I had no evidence that the doctor disagreed with the content of the letter he signed. I concluded my May 26, 2022 correspondence to the parties by saying: \u201cI note that Mr. Oleson has been directed to confirm with the Tribunal and Respondent by May 30, 2022 that he attended his May 25th appointment with a mental healthcare provider and advise whether he has a follow-up appointment scheduled and the date of this appointment. If he fails to do so, the Tribunal will consider proposals from the parties about how to proceed.\u201d\n[75] Mr. Oleson did not comply with the Tribunal\u2019s clear directive to provide an update on his May 25, 2022 mental healthcare appointment by May 30, 2022. As such, on June 1, 2022, the Respondent filed this Motion to dismiss the complaint. I established timelines for the parties\u2019 submissions on the Motion.\n[76] After receiving the Respondent\u2019s Motion, Mr. Oleson sent an email on June 7, 2022 saying that he had attended the May 25, 2022 appointment. He also said he intended to go forward with the complaint. On June 9, 2022 he wrote again to confirm he attended the May 25 appointment and that he had a follow up appointment on June 14, 2022. He stated that he was \u201choping to gather \u2026 coping skills for [his] PTSD and anxiety\u201d.\n[77] Mr. Oleson has offered many excuses for failing to meet his deadlines. He is constantly promising to provide information and saying he will get organized if he is given more time. However, I agree with the Respondent that Mr. Oleson has been provided many generous opportunities and allowances by the Tribunal already and he must be held accountable for his failure to adhere to the directions and deadlines set by the Tribunal. If not, as the Respondent submits, the Rules and directions of the Tribunal will effectively be rendered meaningless, placing the Respondent in a position where it cannot rely on them or expect they will be enforced.\n[78] The Tribunal\u2019s record reflects a pattern of behaviour that has led to significant delay on Mr. Oleson\u2019s part. When viewed together, Mr. Oleson\u2019s conduct demonstrates a \u201cwholesale disregard\u201d for the Tribunal\u2019s time limits and Rules of Procedure.\n(ii) The case has remained static for an unreasonable length of time [79] In applying the Seitz test, I do not have to find that the delay in the case has been inordinate. Rather, I must find that, for a time period that is unreasonable in the circumstances, the case has remained static, which I interpret to mean as not having progressed or advanced in any meaningful way.\n[80] I find that the case has been static for approximately two years. The facts set out in the previous section support this finding, as they confirm that the case has not advanced or progressed in any meaningful way since the hearing was first scheduled to take place in April of 2021. The April 2021 hearing was adjourned on the basis of a surgery that Mr. Oleson has yet to have. While he may not be responsible for the delay in the surgery taking place, he could have utilized this time to prepare for the hearing. Nearly two years later, nothing has changed and, as discussed in the next section, I have no reason to believe anything will change in this regard.\n[81] The time period during which the complaint has remained static is unreasonable in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal has an obligation to ensure that its proceedings are conducted both expeditiously and in fairness to all parties, not just the Complainant. At this point, the Respondent has had to prepare for the hearing three times yet has no indication if or when a hearing will actually take place. Such uncertainty does not accord with the Tribunal\u2019s obligation to proceed expeditiously, and to permit this situation to continue would be unfair to the Respondent.\n(iii) Mr. Oleson appears to have no intention of bringing the case to a conclusion\n[82] The Tribunal agreed to adjourn the spring 2022 hearing dates based on Mr. Oleson\u2019s specific request to permit him to seek mental health care in order that he could participate in the hearing, possibly with accommodations as recommended by a medical professional. The adjournment was conditional on Mr. Oleson\u2019s providing an update by May 30, 2022 about his May 25 appointment with a psychologist as well as providing details about his ongoing treatment plan. He did not provide the required update by May 30, 2022, so the Respondent filed this Motion.\n[83] Instead of replying to the Motion, Mr. Oleson raised new issues and referenced new evidence. Also, rather than providing current and relevant medical documentation, he provided a note from a clinical therapist dated July of 2019 which said he was being referred for a consultation with PTSD-like symptoms. At the time he submitted this note in June of 2022, it was already 3 years out of date.\n[84] I note that Mr. Oleson sent an email to the Tribunal and the parties on October 11, 2022, confirming that he had seen a psychiatrist on October 4, 2022 and that he had been diagnosed with \u201canxiety, depression and compounded PTSD\u201d and that he would be seeing his primary doctor. He says he hopes accommodations for his disabilities will be honored but provides no information about what accommodations are required or whether these diagnosed conditions would affect his ability to participate in the Tribunal proceeding.\n[85] I acknowledge that Mr. Oleson has been participating in the Case Management of his mother\u2019s complaint while dealing with many personal issues as well as the grief of losing his mother, whom he lived with and cared for in her final years. While I have no reason to doubt his assertion that he has been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression, he has still failed to provide the Tribunal with any evidence that he is receiving treatment from a medical professional. He has similarly provided no evidence from a medical professional about the effects of his conditions on his ability to participate in the Tribunal\u2019s proceedings, either with or without accommodation. If he does have a treatment plan, he has provided no timeline indicating when he may be able to participate in the hearing of this complaint.\n[86] It was up to Mr. Oleson to provide the Tribunal with the information that would assist it to \u201cunderstand and accommodate\u201d his disability, as he stated in his April 2022 adjournment request. Eight months after the May 25, 2022 appointment, he has still not done so. I agree with the Respondent that the limited information Mr. Oleson has provided does not give rise to a path forward. His October 11, 2022 email provides no information that would allow the Tribunal and Respondent to assess how or when the matter can proceed. If Mr. Oleson were serious about pursuing this complaint, he should have acted with diligence in providing the parties and Tribunal with information that would assist them to proceed to a hearing expeditiously, as required by the CHRA.\n[87] I also note that, in his October 11, 2022 email, Mr. Oleson says he opposes the Respondent\u2019s Motion \u201cand will do so in writing hopefully this coming week which I already have in draft.\u201d He also says he has \u201cnew evidence\u201d that will be provided once it is assembled. He concludes by saying that he will send the appropriate information to get the case moving forward. He has sent nothing further since then. Mr. Oleson\u2019s deadline to reply to the Respondent\u2019s Motion was June 17, 2022. His assertion in October of 2022 that he intended to reply to the Motion at some future date is a further example of Mr. Oleson\u2019s disregard for the Tribunal\u2019s Rules and directions.\n[88] Mr. Oleson has not provided the Tribunal and the parties with anything that would indicate that he has any real intention of advancing this complaint to a hearing. His past promises and assurances to move the case forward have not been realized. It appears to the Tribunal that Mr. Oleson has no real intent to bring the complaint to a conclusion.\n(iv) Abuse of Process [89] Mr. Oleson\u2019s failures to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules and directions, his requests for extensions of nearly every deadline, and his requests to adjourn the hearing dates, as well as his continual reference to further issues and evidence he intends to introduce, have resulted in unfairness and costs to the Respondent, which has retained legal counsel and has had to prepare repeatedly for the hearing and to respond to Mr. Oleson\u2019s various requests.\n[90] However, the Seitz approach requires the Tribunal to consider the impact of Mr. Oleson\u2019s delays and failures to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure and directions not only from the perspective of the parties, but also in terms of an abuse of the administration of justice, \u201cseparate and apart from any prejudice caused by inordinate and inexcusable delay. These sorts of cases can give rise to a finding of an abuse of process\u201d (Chisholm at para 19; see also Mattice v Westower Communications Ltd., 2014 CHRT 32 (CanLII) [\u201cMattice\u201d] at para 41).\n[91] As the Tribunal has previously stated, it is not in the public interest for human rights complaints to remain unresolved over a long period of time. The Tribunal is mandated to conduct its proceedings informally and expeditiously in accordance with its Rules of Procedure and the requirements of natural justice. \u201cThe more time that passes, the greater the prejudice for the public\u201d (Constantinescu at para 38).\n[92] The human rights complaint process is designed to ensure respect for the rights of complainants, some of whom are very vulnerable members of society. However, the Tribunal is also obliged to respect the principles of natural justice, meaning the Tribunal owes a duty of fairness to all parties. \u201cWhile the Tribunal gives due consideration to accommodating the needs of self-represented parties to allow them the full and ample opportunity to present their case, it will not do so to the detriment of the other parties or the Tribunal\u201d (Mattice at para 51).\n[93] The proceeding, as it is being conducted by Mr. Oleson, constitutes an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s process. It is unfair not only to the Respondent First Nation, but also to the Tribunal and Commission, both of which are funded by taxpayers and which have many other complaints that are equally entitled to their time and resources. The CHRA requires a reasonably quick resolution of human rights complaints, and that has not and will not happen in this case.\n[94] I have also considered the prejudice to the Complainant in having the complaint dismissed. In this case, the Complainant herself is deceased and Mr. Oleson represents her Estate. The public interest aspect of the complaint has already been settled between the Commission and the Respondent. When considering the facts of the case, the need for efficiency and economy and the importance of bringing finality to human rights complaints, the duty of fairness to all parties, and any prejudice to the parties and to the administration of justice, I conclude that the balance clearly weighs in favour of dismissal of the complaint.\nIV.

The decision will be published in both official languages once the translation is finalized, as required by the Official Languages Act.\nSummary:\nThe Tribunal found that coworkers of Mr. Abadi at TST Overland Express (TST), a trucking company, harassed him for fourteen years. The Tribunal also found that TST discriminated against Mr. Abadi based on his disability when TST ended Mr. Abadi\u2019s employment.\nStarting in 2006, coworkers ridiculed Mr. Abadi for his accent, origin and having immigrated to Canada. In 2009 or 2010, the company dispatcher put posters on a bulletin board in the workplace. The posters had company pictures of or drawings about Mr. Abadi with discriminatory comments added to them. People at work called him by demeaning names. They said that individuals in news reports about terrorism were his cousins and referred to a former Libyan leader as his uncle. They suggested that, when visiting his family, he might be visiting a terrorist camp and become a terrorist. About 85% of the drivers at TST called him by demeaning names. This continued until TST ended his employment.\nThe conduct was unwelcome, occurred repeatedly and related to actual or perceived race, national or ethnic origin and religion. TST did not have an effective harassment policy in place. TST\u2019s on-site management was aware of the harassment, did nothing to stop it and tolerated it. TST did not show due diligence to prevent, mitigate or avoid the effects of the harassment. The Tribunal rejected TST\u2019s arguments that the harassment happened so long ago that it would be unfair for the Tribunal to rule on it.\nIn 2019, TST ended Mr. Abadi\u2019s employment when he did not return on time from a vacation. The physical impairment that Mr. Abadi developed while on vacation was a disability that had prevented him from returning to work on time. Initially, Mr. Abadi told TST that no flights were available. After TST notified Mr. Abadi that he must return to work within three days, Mr. Abadi sent pictures to TST that showed his medical condition. Mr. Abadi\u2019s explanation for why he did not share his medical details earlier was understandable given his experience of having been harassed. Disability was a factor in TST\u2019s decision to end his employment.\nTST did not establish any defences. Mr. Abadi had sought two weeks of unpaid leave so that he could get medical clearance to fly home. TST established no bona fide occupational requirement that would have prevented this accommodation. The information Mr. Abadi had sent was enough to let TST know that he had a health issue. TST did not ask for more medical information when making the decision to end his employment. There was no evidence that accommodating Mr. Abadi\u2019s request would have caused TST undue hardship. TST\u2019s termination of Mr. Abadi was a discriminatory practice.\nIn contrast to the findings on disability, the Tribunal did not find that actual or perceived race, origin and religion were factors in TST\u2019s decision to end Mr. Abadi\u2019s employment.\nMr. Abadi held other jobs after working at TST, but they were not comparable to his job at TST. During a six-month trip to visit family, Mr. Abadi did not make reasonable efforts to find comparable employment. This trip broke the causal link between the discrimination and his loss of income. The Tribunal ordered $44,731 in lost wages and directed the parties to calculate amounts for vacation leave and pension contributions for the months between the end of his employment and his six-month trip. The Tribunal also ordered $17,000 for pain and suffering, $12,000 for TST\u2019s recklessness, and interest from the date of termination.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

OVERVIEW [1] The Complainant seeks an order to add a third party, Dr. Stephen John Charman Hucker, as a respondent to her human rights complaint. The Complainant states in her complaint that she is an Indigenous transgender woman in the custody of the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC). She alleges that the CSC\u2019s practice for determining access to gender-affirming care for gender diverse prisoners is discriminatory and in particular that Dr. Hucker, a forensic psychiatrist contracted by the CSC, outed her to her family and home community without her consent. She contends that these actions amount to discrimination based on gender identity or expression.\n[2] Her complaint only named the CSC as respondent.\nII. DECISION [3] For the following reasons, I deny the request.\nIII. ISSUES [4] Should I exercise my discretion to allow the Complainant to add Dr. Hucker as a respondent?\nIV. BACKGROUND [5] The Complainant is detained at a prison operated by the CSC. In the complaint, she alleges that the CSC contracted Dr. Hucker to make a gender-dysphoria assessment of her. He interviewed her on July 6, 2018, and issued a report on August 3, 2018. She claims that after interviewing her, Dr. Hucker disclosed personal information about her gender identity and expression to third parties in her home community, effectively outing her, all without her consent. This included seeking input from her estranged wife.\n[6] The complaint focusses almost entirely on Dr. Hucker\u2019s actions. She contends that he relied on her estranged wife\u2019s views and on the fact that she had not come out earlier to conclude that she was not a transgendered woman. She adds that Dr. Hucker deliberately misgendered her numerous times in his report. He ultimately recommended that she not be offered feminizing hormones and that she abandon her \u201cstrategy\u201d regarding sex transformation.\n[7] In her complaint, the Complainant alleges that Dr. Hucker\u2019s conduct towards her amounted to willful and reckless discrimination and harassment on the grounds of gender identity and expression. She specifies that he outed her to persons in her small community, denied her right to self-determine her gender identity, and accused her of falsifying her gender identity based on stereotypical and discriminatory assumptions.\n[8] The complaint is three pages long. Her allegations about the CSC\u2019s responsibility in this matter are set out in the last paragraph of the two-page portion of the complaint entitled \u201cSummary and details of discrimination at issue.\u201d The Complainant states that the CSC controls her access to healthcare and submits that the CSC has an obligation to ensure the professionals it hires abide by CSC policies and uphold the CSC\u2019s human rights obligations. Since the CSC contracted Dr. Hucker\u2019s services, it is liable for his discriminatory conduct and for compounding the discrimination by defending his report and refusing to pay for a new assessment. The last page of her complaint form details the impact of the alleged discrimination on her and the steps she took to address it.\n[9] The Complainant\u2019s lawyer filed the signed complaint form with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) on June 27, 2019. The Summary of Complaint prepared by the Commission, which is attached to the complaint, states that the alleged discriminatory practice is the denial of service on a prohibited ground of discrimination (s.5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (Act)).\n[10] Both the signed complaint form and the Summary of Complaint only list the CSC as the respondent.\n[11] The Commission reviewed the complaint, its investigation report, and the parties\u2019 submissions, and decided on June 15, 2022, to request that the Tribunal conduct an inquiry into the complaint. The letter to the Tribunal Chairperson refers to the case as a complaint against the CSC.\n[12] On December 13, 2022, the Complainant\u2019s lawyer wrote to the Tribunal and other parties to advise them that she intended to file a motion for a confidentiality order and another motion to add Dr. Hucker as a respondent. I directed that the confidentiality motion be dealt with first and issued a ruling on April 3, 2023. The parties and Dr. Hucker filed their submissions on the second motion between April 21 and June 30, 2023.\n[13] The Commission supports the Complainant\u2019s request, while the CSC takes no position. Dr. Hucker opposes it.\nV. ANALYSIS [14] There is no dispute that the Tribunal has the authority to add parties to a case. Rule 29 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137, sets out the procedure for making this request, which includes a requirement that the prospective party be notified of it and be given the opportunity to make submissions.\n[15] Peters v. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., 2019 CHRT 15 (CanLII) (Peters) explained how the Tribunal has dealt with these requests over the years. It observed that because the addition of a party at the inquiry stage could deprive the party of the Commission\u2019s screening function under ss. 41 and 44 of the Act, the Tribunal must carefully consider the various risks and prejudice that may result and weigh the factors involved (paras. 39-40).\n[16] In Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone section locale 5044 du SCFP v. Telus communications (Qu\u00e9bec) inc., 2003 CHRT 31 at paras. 30, 36 (Telus), the Tribunal held that the addition of a new respondent is appropriate if it is established that:\nThe presence of this new party is necessary to dispose of the complaint.\nIt was not reasonably foreseeable, once the complaint was filed with the Commission, that the addition of a new respondent would be necessary to dispose of the complaint.\nThe addition of a new party will not result in serious prejudice to that party.\n[17] Peters noted that the Tribunal has usually considered the first two Telus criteria in determining whether a party ought to be added to proceedings before the Tribunal. However, Peters also commented that Telus was not intended to establish a closed list of factors to consider (para. 44), especially given the Tribunal\u2019s statutory obligation to conduct its proceedings in an informal and expeditious manner within the necessary bounds of natural justice and procedural fairness (s. 48.9(1) of the Act).\n[18] Accordingly, the Tribunal in Peters concluded that in the specific facts of that case, an analysis of the Telus factors was not conclusive. The Tribunal had to consider factors beyond those laid out in Telus.\n[19] The Complainant submits that given the concerns about the rigid application of Telus, I should go further than Peters and abandon the Telus test entirely as the analytical framework. Her lawyer proposed a reformulated two-part test. The Commission supports her submission and proposes that in plain language it would read as follows:\nWould it be in the public interest to add the proposed respondent?\nDoes the benefit of adding the proposed respondent outweigh the potential prejudice to the proposed respondent?\n[20] The Complainant then went on to set out 10 factors to consider in applying this test.\n[21] I am not persuaded that a complete reformulation with an inventory of 10 or more factors is needed. As Peters noted, the Telus criteria are useful factors that can be supplemented by others, depending on a given case\u2019s facts. Creating a long list of factors as a new test would not be any more helpful. I think the two general considerations reflected in the Commission\u2019s proposal (public interest and prejudice) are broadly addressed whenever examining such requests, whether by just applying the Telus criteria or considering other factors that are relevant to a particular case.\n[22] I will consequently analyze the Complainant\u2019s request by considering the Telus criteria and other relevant factors whether found in Peters or in the parties\u2019 submissions.\nA. It was reasonably foreseeable that Dr. Hucker should be named as a respondent [23] In my view, the most important factor to consider in the facts of this case is the second Telus factor, reasonable foreseeability. The Complainant not only knew about Dr. Hucker\u2019s involvement in the issues raised in her complaint, but her entire case is almost entirely about him and his alleged discriminatory practices. Until the last paragraph, the complaint basically only talks about him, and she maintains emphatically in her motion that her complaint\u2019s allegations against him are not frivolous or speculative.\n[24] Yet, the complaint was filed only against the CSC. Complainants often file complaints against the organization that would be vicariously liable for the conduct of a wrongdoer for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that the organization may have the means or be best placed to provide the appropriate remedy, such as the implementation of systemic remedies.\n[25] The Commission and Complainant argue that merely because it was reasonably foreseeable from the outset that Dr. Hucker would be necessary to fully dispose of the complaint, the Complainant should not be denied the request to add him now. They suggest that it is a better alternative than having the Complainant file a fresh complaint against Dr. Hucker and ask the Commission to exercise its discretion under s. 41(1)(e) of the Act to accept the complaint despite the passage of time. This would be inefficient and inconsistent with the instruction in s. 48.9(1) that Tribunal proceedings be conducted as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and rules of procedure allow.\n[26] Section 41(1)(e) provides that the Commission is not required to deal with a complaint if it is based on acts or omissions that occurred more than one year before it receives the complaint, or a longer period if the Commission considers it appropriate. In other words, the Commission has the discretion to decide whether to deal with a complaint about acts or omissions that occurred more than a year before. The remaining provisions in s. 41(1) set out other reasons why the Commission may decide not to deal with a complaint (i.e., it is beyond its jurisdiction; it is trivial, frivolous, vexatious, or made in bad faith; the matter can be more appropriately dealt with under another act; the complainant should exhaust other recourses first).\n[27] The Commission and Complainant\u2019s argument is troubling. How can the Commission presuppose how it would independently assess a properly formulated complaint against Dr. Hucker? We do not know if it would decide to exercise its discretion to deal with the complaint beyond the one-year period mentioned in s. 41(1)(e) after a lapse of well over three years since the alleged discriminatory practice. We do not know how the Commission would address any other objections or representations by Dr. Hucker in the exercise of its authority under the Act.\n[28] The Commission and Complainant contend that the Tribunal could address Dr. Hucker\u2019s objections at the hearing stage, as Peters determined regarding the proposed respondent in that case.\n[29] However, the Commission\u2019s authority, particularly under s. 41(1)(e), is not one that the Tribunal can ever assume. The Tribunal has repeatedly held in inverse situations, where respondents have requested that a complaint be dismissed because it was filed after the expiry of the one-year period, that the Tribunal must respect the Commission\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether to deal with such complaints unless there is evidence that a fair hearing has become impossible due to the excessive passage of time (see Pequeneza v. Canada Post Corporation, 2016 CHRT 21).\n[30] The problem is particularly acute in this instance. The Tribunal cannot usurp the Commission\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether it is appropriate to deal with a complaint that is being initiated against Dr. Hucker over three years after the alleged acts and omissions took place, even though the Complainant has been fully aware of the potential claims against him since then. Under the Act, the decision to accept and deal with the complaint is the Commission\u2019s to make, not the Tribunal\u2019s.\n[31] The Commission referred to the general rule that issues arising out of the same set of factual circumstances should normally be heard together, which improves the efficiency of the process and avoids the possibility of inconsistent rulings. However, this rule is ordinarily applied to join several existing proceedings that are properly before the adjudicating body. In the present case, I am only seized with a single complaint, filed against one responding party, the CSC.\n[32] I also note that the Complainant gave no explanation for why she did not include Dr. Hucker as a respondent, despite his name appearing throughout almost all of her complaint. In contrast, in Peters, there was evidence that the complainant intended to name the other party as a respondent from the outset but was unable to due to a technical problem with the Commission\u2019s website. In Peters, the Commission recognized in its pleadings that there may have been an error made in the filing of the complaint.\n[33] Similarly, in Leonard v. Canadian American Transportation Inc., 2022 CHRT 20, the complainant had named the proposed additional party as a respondent in the initially filed complaint but, somehow, the Commission withdrew that party\u2019s name from the complaint without providing advance notice or reasons to the complainant.\n[34] There is no similar indication of error or other explanation for failing to include Dr. Hucker as a respondent in this case.\n[35] In Peters, the Commission also stated that it was unable to contact the other party during its investigation and that he was unavailable for an interview, which may have further explained why he was not included as a respondent in the complaint that was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. In contrast, the Commission in the present case was in constant contact with Dr. Hucker. According to the Complainant\u2019s outline of the facts, the Commission\u2019s human rights officer spoke directly to Dr. Hucker. The Complainant submits that Dr. Hucker was an active participant in the Commission investigative process and that the investigation report set out his position.\n[36] Yet, there was no reason provided for why there was no follow-up to include him as a respondent before the complaint was sent to the Tribunal for inquiry.\n[37] The Complainant submits that she declared her intention to request Dr. Hucker\u2019s inclusion at the earliest opportunity, about six months after the complaint was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry, before the Statements of Particulars were due. This would minimize any prejudice to him and the CSC. I do not agree. It is a mischaracterization of the facts. The complaint dealt almost exclusively with Dr. Hucker. The earliest opportunity to file a complaint against him was in June 2019, when she filed the complaint with the Commission through her legal counsel. Her declaration of intention, which she made on December 13, 2022, was hardly her first opportunity.\n[38] Finally, I am concerned about what this suggested approach would give rise to. It effectively allows parties to bypass the Commission\u2019s gatekeeping function as set out in the Act. Rather than making sure to organize one\u2019s case and name all known potential respondents, which in turn affords them the Act\u2019s procedural protections, complainants may opt to just act against one respondent and not worry about following up with any other, in the assurance that this omission will be addressed by the Tribunal years later. This is the wrong message to be sending to stakeholders. Parliament must be presumed to have set up the Act\u2019s complaint process scheme for a reason. Parties should not be able to easily ignore it.\n[39] In sum, it was obvious, let alone reasonably foreseeable, that Dr. Hucker should be a respondent when the complaint was filed. This mitigates strongly against granting any request to add him as a respondent at this stage, well over three years later.\nB. The inclusion of Dr. Hucker as a party to these proceedings is not \u201cnecessary\u201d [40] The Complainant and Commission argue that Dr. Hucker must be added as a respondent because his conduct is at the heart of this complaint. He has first-hand knowledge of the interactions that took place with the Complainant and third parties, as well as his reasoning for the positions he took in his report. He may also be holding documents that are arguably relevant to these proceedings that are not within the CSC\u2019s power, possession, or control. He can more appropriately respond to the allegations than the CSC and may have a different perspective on whether the CSC acted with due diligence in this case, such as whether the CSC\u2019s policies were properly conveyed to him.\n[41] However, this information can be accessed without making him a respondent. It can be acquired by compelling him to testify as a witness. The Tribunal has the authority to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses, to compel them to give evidence, and to produce any documents and things the Tribunal considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint (s. 50(3)(a) of the Act).\n[42] The Commission and Complainant acknowledge this but maintain that it would be \u201cmore efficient\u201d to have the documents listed and disclosed early, and to know his position on the issues, as part of the case management process. This argument is not sustainable. Just because it would be easier and more convenient for the Complainant and Commission to present their cases does not mean that Dr. Hucker\u2019s involvement is necessary, particularly when weighed against the resulting denial to him of the Act\u2019s procedural protections by adding him as a party at this stage.\nC. The availability of additional remedies against Dr. Hucker is not a factor [43] Under s. 65(1) of the Act, an organization is deemed to have committed any act or omission committed by its agent or employee. But the organization can exculpate itself of this vicarious liability if it proves that it fulfilled the conditions set out in s. 65(2). The Commission argues that at this stage, before the CSC has filed its Statement of Particulars, we do not know if the CSC intends to raise a defence under s. 65(2) of the Act. If it does and is successful in exculpating itself from liability for Dr. Hucker\u2019s actions, then the Complainant will be left without a remedy.\n[44] I am not persuaded by this argument. Whenever a complaint is filed against an organization based on the alleged discriminatory acts or omissions of its employees or agents, it is almost certain that the employer will try to exculpate itself from liability under s. 65(2). Given this reality, when the complaint is filed, a complainant can name as respondent the employee or agent who committed the discriminatory practice to preserve for themselves the possibility of obtaining a remedy against them.\n[45] There may be situations where a complainant does not know the identity of the agent or employee when they file their complaint but learn it later, possibly through the disclosure process. It is understandable if the complainant then asks to add them as respondents.\n[46] In this case, however, the Complainant and the Commission knew Dr. Hucker\u2019s identity and his involvement in the alleged discriminatory practice from the outset. Indeed, almost all of the complaint explicitly refers to him. It is unreasonable to argue that Dr. Hucker should be added as a respondent, well over three years later, simply because the Complainant has suddenly realized that the CSC might have a successful s. 65(2) defence.\n[47] The argument does not stand.\nD. The fact that Dr. Hucker knew of the allegations for years does not negate the prejudicial effect [48] The Complainant points out that Dr. Hucker was interviewed by the Commission\u2019s human rights officer and thus participated in its investigation. He also learned of the allegations against him in at least two other forums\u2014the CSC\u2019s internal grievance process and a complaint against him at the College of Surgeons and Physicians of Ontario. He has known of her allegations since at least May 2019. He therefore has had ample opportunity to preserve evidence and take steps to prepare to respond to the Complainant's allegations. The Complainant argues that this prejudice is \u201cminimal\u201d and does not outweigh the harm in forcing her to file a new complaint against him with the Commission.\n[49] This argument takes the Act\u2019s complaint screening process too lightly. Respondents are afforded procedural protections that should not be so easily displaced, particularly in these circumstances where the additional party\u2019s identity and role have been known from the outset and where no reason was given for failing to name him as a respondent in the first place.\n[50] Furthermore, Dr. Hucker submits that although he participated in the Commission\u2019s investigation, he did not have an opportunity to provide a formal or fulsome defence to the Complainant\u2019s allegations. He states that he engaged in the investigation on a good-faith basis and on an understanding that he would not be named as a respondent. In addition, he was not permitted to clarify, correct, or defend any conclusions made by the human rights officer regarding his conduct in the investigation report.\n[51] The Complainant counters that the CSC\u2019s reply to the report suggests that it closely collaborated with Dr. Hucker, which enabled him to make a fulsome defence. However, this contradicts the Complainant\u2019s previous submission that Dr. Hucker\u2019s addition is necessary because he may have a perspective on the facts and issues that differs from the CSC\u2019s. This is indeed quite possible, which is why he should benefit from the same procedural protections under the Act as the CSC.\n[52] I note that in another case where the Tribunal exercised its discretion and allowed the addition of another party (Harrison v. Curve Lake First Nation, 2018 CHRT 7), a separate human rights complaint on the same issue had been filed against the proposed respondent, which the Commission investigated. It is not clear whether the other complaint was ever referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. Nonetheless, the party was able to address the allegations as a respondent during the Commission\u2019s investigative process. In the present case, no human rights complaint was ever filed against Dr. Hucker personally. He may have conducted himself and reacted to the report differently if he knew that his personal liability was at stake.\n[53] Dr. Hucker correctly points out that the Commission's investigation process is a defined and essential step in the proceeding that serves a critical screening function and affords respondents with the essential right to dispute the allegations at an early stage. His cooperation with the Commission\u2019s investigation cannot be construed as a meaningful participation in that process, as a named respondent would have been entitled to. The prejudice to him of not benefitting from the procedural protections in this process was not cured by this limited participation of speaking to the human rights officer and collaborating with the CSC, whose interests may not necessarily have been aligned with his.\n[54] For all these reasons, I find the Complainant\u2019s request to add Dr. Hucker to this complaint as a respondent at this stage is not justified. I will not exercise the discretion to grant it.\nVI.

RULING [1] The Complainant, Christopher Garnier, a federal inmate incarcerated in an institution operated by the Respondent Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) alleges that CSC failed to accommodate his disability contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act RSC, 1985, c. H-6 (CHRA).\n[2] CSC denies discriminating and has filed a motion to strike parts of Mr. Garnier\u2019s Statement of Particulars (SOP), and in particular paragraphs 8-25, 28-29, 30 and 32-40 (Paragraphs), on the basis that they raise allegations not included in Mr. Garnier\u2019s initial complaint (Complaint) filed with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission).\n[3] Mr. Garnier opposes the motion and the Commission takes no position.\n[4] For reasons that follow, CSC\u2019s motion is allowed and the Paragraphs are struck.\nII. CONTEXT [5] Mr. Garnier alleges he experienced disability-related discrimination by CSC while incarcerated in Atlantic Institution in Renous, New Brunswick, contrary to section 5 of the CHRA. Specifically, Mr. Garnier makes the following allegations in his Complaint filed with the Commission in June 2019:\nCSC denied him the right to access proper mental health treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because CSC did not consider his disability a contributing criminogenic factor to his offence; and Although Mr. Garnier received psychological assistance on admission to federal custody in September 2018 until April 2019, the treatment providers at Atlantic Institution did not have the \u201cknowledge, education, training or expertise\u201d to provide PTSD treatment.\n[6] In his Complaint, Mr. Garnier states that he \u201cdoes not have any complaint against the staff and management at [Atlantic Institution]. The complaint is in relation to the corporate policies and procedures that form the basis for the institution\u2019s practices\u201d.\n[7] The Commission attached its Record of Decision dated June 2, 2021 to its referral letter to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (Tribunal). In the Record of Decision, the Commission says that the Complaint \u201cspecifically alleges that the Respondent has pursued a discriminatory policy or practice in relation to the provision of mental health treatment and resources for inmates\u201d.\n[8] In Mr. Garnier\u2019s SOP filed with the Tribunal in November 2022, he repeats the above allegations from his Complaint. He also makes additional allegations in the Paragraphs sought to be struck by the CSC, which include the following:\nMr. Garnier was transported to\/from Atlantic Institution and a local hospital for back surgery in June 2022 in a CSC vehicle with poor health and safety conditions. On his return to Atlantic Institution following back surgery, CSC provided him improper post-operative health care and treatment which caused him physical and mental suffering. Mr. Garnier developed a lung ailment during his incarceration at Atlantic Institution, and CSC provided him improper health care and treatment which caused him physical and mental suffering.\nIII. ANALYSIS [9] The Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited by the content of the original complaint filed with the Commission and the Commission\u2019s decision when referring the complaint to the Tribunal for inquiry: Connors v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2019 CHRT 6 at para. 28.\n[10] The Tribunal has authority to amend a complaint for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties. However, an amendment cannot introduce a substantially new complaint, as this would bypass the Commission referral process required by the CHRA. Where a proposed amendment falls outside the scope of the complaint referred by the Commission, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to include it in its inquiry: MacEachern v. Correctional Service of Canada, 2014 CHRT 4 at para. 9-12.\n[11] Additionally, the Tribunal will generally not grant an amendment if it is plain and obvious that the amendment cannot succeed in proving discrimination: Saviye v. Afroglobal Network Inc. and Michael Daramola, 2016 CHRT 18 at para. 15.\n[12] In Moore v. British Columbia, 2012 SCC 61 (Moore), the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the requirements to prove discrimination. The Court held that complainants must show that they have a characteristic protected from discrimination, that they experienced an adverse impact in a protected area, and that the protected characteristic was a factor in the adverse impact. If the complainant proves these elements, then the burden shifts to the respondent to justify their conduct. If the conduct is justified, there is no discrimination.\n[13] In this case, Mr. Garnier submits that although his Complaint only addresses the issue of CSC\u2019s alleged mistreatment of his PTSD, the Tribunal should not preclude him from adding to his SOP CSC\u2019s alleged subsequent mistreatment of his physical health issues. Mr. Garnier states that \u201cmental and physical health is indisputably entwined\u201d and cites statements from the World Health Organization and the Canadian Mental Health Association which refer to mental and physical health as being \u201cfundamentally linked\u201d.\n[14] While there is no dispute that physical and mental health can be connected, this issue is not of particular relevance in addressing CSC\u2019s motion to strike.\n[15] There must be a clear connection between the amendments sought and the complaint that was investigated and referred to the Tribunal by the Commission. In this case, there is no such connection.\n[16] CSC\u2019s alleged improper treatment of Mr. Garnier\u2019s PTSD (raised in the Complaint) arises from entirely separate factual circumstances and time periods than CSC\u2019s alleged improper transport of Mr. Garnier to the hospital and improper care of his physical ailments (raised in the SOP).\n[17] Additionally, regarding the third element of the Moore test, there is no allegation that Mr. Garnier\u2019s mental disability or other protected characteristic was a factor in his alleged improper transport or in CSC\u2019s care for his physical ailments. Mr. Garnier states that CSC\u2019s mode of transport was a risk to \u201call inmates\u201d (no prohibited characteristic identified) and that CSC made him feel as though he was not equal to persons that are not inmates (status of incarceration is not a prohibited ground under the CHRA).\n[18] Even if Mr. Garnier experienced exacerbation of mental health issues from CSC\u2019s alleged mistreatment of his physical ailments, exacerbation alone is generally insufficient to establish adverse or differential treatment on the basis of a prohibited ground as required in Moore.\n[19] Mr. Garnier makes extensive submissions regarding CSC\u2019s purported awareness of legal concerns raised by the Office of the Correctional Investigator (OCI) about CSC\u2019s prisoner security escort vehicles. He cites OCI reports regarding injuries arising from the negligent transport of inmates to support his position that CSC is in violation of its duty of care to inmates.\n[20] The safe transport of inmates is undoubtedly an important issue. However, the OCI\u2019s information is not relevant to CSC\u2019s motion to strike as the transport issue is unrelated to the subject matter of Mr. Garnier\u2019s Complaint, which is CSC\u2019s alleged discriminatory treatment of his PTSD.\n[21] Finally, in Mr. Garnier\u2019s response submission to CSC\u2019s motion to strike, he raises the prospect of retaliation as a possible justification for expanding the scope of the Complaint. Specifically, he submits that it may be possible that CSC\u2019s improper transport and mistreatment of his physical ailments could be in retaliation to his Complaint.\n[22] However, Mr. Garnier makes no allegation in his SOP that CSC\u2019s alleged improper transport or mistreatment of his physical ailments was in retaliation for him filing the Complaint. Similarly, there is no allegation that CSC engaged in retaliation in Mr. Garnier\u2019s Complaint or in the Commission\u2019s referral record to the Tribunal.\n[23] In these circumstances, it is not sufficient for Mr. Garnier to raise a bald assertion of retaliation, without particulars, in a response argument to a motion to attempt to link otherwise unrelated and disparate factual circumstances. To permit this would be to create a procedurally unfair moving target that allows allegations to be raised in argument that are not otherwise tied to an initial complaint or statement of particulars.\nIV. CONCLUSION [24] CSC\u2019s motion is allowed. The Paragraphs are struck from Mr. Garnier\u2019s SOP.\nSigned by\nPaul Singh\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 21, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2679\/5521\nStyle of Cause:\nGarnier v.

OVERVIEW [1] The Complainant Ishrat Nipa is a Canadian citizen who came to Canada from Bangladesh. She alleges that the Respondent discriminated against her on the basis of her race and\/or her national or ethnic origin by changing a passing mark she had achieved in a formal merit based oral interview to a failing mark after a subsequent informal non merit based oral interview, thereby eliminating her from an employment selection process, contrary to section 7 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[2] On January 9, 2020, Ms. Nipa accepted an invitation from the Respondent for a formal merit based oral interview for the position of ATIP (Access to Information and Privacy) Junior Officer Level PM-01 (the \u201cjob\u201d) in Selection Process#19-EA-HRS-96729 Transport Canada (the \u201cselection process\u201d).\n[3] She was originally passed for inclusion into a pool of qualified applicants for the job following her successful formal merit based oral interview that was conducted on January 20, 2020 by two experienced managers. She also submitted her references required in the selection process as well as all forms and information requested by the Respondent.\n[4] In the formal merit based oral interview Ms. Nipa was given a passing mark in all of the merit criteria assessed. The two managers who interviewed her gave her a passing mark of 3 out of 5 for the merit criteria of \u201cability to communicate effectively orally\u201d, although one of the interviewers noted difficulty in understanding her and that she did not speak clearly.\n[5] Subsequently, on February 20, 2020 Ms. Nipa attended an informal non merit based oral interview she had been invited to by the Respondent with two different managers who said they had difficulty understanding what Ms. Nipa was saying and expressed concerns to their Director about her ability to comprehend and communicate orally.\n[6] Following the informal non merit based oral interview, the Director met with the informal interview managers and the formal interview managers. It was agreed, upon receiving advice from a Human Resources advisor who was consulted by the Director, that Ms. Nipa\u2019s passing mark in the formal merit based oral interview for the merit criteria of \u201cability to effectively communicate orally\u201d would be changed from a pass to a fail, resulting in her failing the formal merit based oral interview and being eliminated from the selection process.\n[7] The Respondent denies that it discriminated against Ms. Nipa and contends that the changing of her mark and her elimination from the selection process was due to concerns that the informal interview managers had about her oral communication skills when they interviewed her that were similar to concerns raised about her performance in this essential merit criteria by the formal interview managers when they interviewed her. As a result they concluded, on the advice of the HR advisor, that they could not qualify her based on merit as required by section 30 of the Public Service Employment Act (PSEA).\n[8] In considering the evidence adduced at the hearing, the Tribunal has determined that while the decision to change her mark and eliminate Ms. Nipa from the selection process was unusual and hurtful to her and may have been procedurally irregular and flawed, there is no reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence that the decision was based on Ms. Nipa\u2019s race and or national or ethnic origin. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that the decision was not discriminatory under the CHRA. As a result, Ms. Nipa\u2019s complaint is dismissed.\nII. BACKGROUND [9] The main facts in this case are not in issue. Rather, the parties disagree on the reason why Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark was changed in one of the essential merit criteria she was initially assessed on from a pass to a fail, resulting in her elimination from the selection process. Hence, the only issue to be determined in this case is whether the Respondent discriminated against Ms. Nipa, on the basis of her race and or national or ethnic origin, in changing her mark and eliminating her from the selection process, contrary to section 7 of the CHRA.\n[10] In response to her online application that was determined to meet the initial screening criteria, Ms. Nipa accepted an invitation from the Respondent on January 9, 2020 for a formal merit based oral interview in the selection process for the job to take place on Monday, January 20, 2020 at 9 am at 330 Sparks Street in Ottawa. The Respondent had announced the selection process to create a pool of qualified candidates to recruit Junior ATIP officers in the Respondent\u2019s ATIP Office.\n[11] The job was an entry level administrative job involving the receipt and processing of ATIP requests from the Respondent, including interacting verbally with applicants and staff.\n[12] The invitation from the Respondent stated that the interview was designed to assess the following 6 merit criteria:\n#1. Ability to plan and organize\n#2. Effective Interpersonal Relationships\n#3. Analytical Thinking\n#4. Dependability\n#5. Team Work\n#6 Ability to communicate effectively orally.\n[13] In addition, the invitation from the Respondent stated that \u201cIf you are successful in the interview phase, Reference Checks will then be completed\u201d and requested that the references should be provided \u201cat this time\u201d. The invitation also requested that photo identification and proof of education be provided at the interview. The invitation didn\u2019t specify the need to produce forms in regard to security clearance for potential future appointments from the pool of candidates. Ms. Nipa submitted all of the reference checks, photo identification, proof of education and security clearance forms requested by the Respondent on time.\n[14] There was no mention in the invitation from the Respondent or the information to candidates for the formal merit based oral interview about there being a subsequent informal non merit based oral interview that would take place in the selection process or assessment process. There was information that selection from the pool of qualified candidates would be based on the results of the entire assessment process.\n[15] The Respondent also provided candidates with instructions about the formal merit based oral interview that prior to the interview candidates would have 30 minutes of preparation time to review all interview questions and that the interview would be 60 minutes in length. It was noted that only the answers provided orally to the jury members during the interview would be assessed and all notes written during preparation, although given back to jury members, would not be considered at any moment of the assessment exercise.\n[16] For each merit criteria except #6 there was a hypothetical scenario or situation related to the specific merit criteria with questions about how to deal with each scenario or situation. In the case of merit criteria # 6 there were no scenarios or situations or questions, rather the assessment of this merit criteria was to be based on how effectively the candidate communicated orally in responding to the questions about the other 5 merit criteria scenarios and situations throughout the interview.\n[17] The Interview Rating Guide noted for all of the merit criteria assessed that \u201cA Pass Mark on all individual essential merit criteria must be obtained in order to pass the overall interview.\u201d The scoring was marked out of 5 for each merit criteria.\n[18] Ms. Nipa attended at the formal merit based oral interview on January 20, 2020 and prepared notes in reviewing the interview questions during the preparation period before the interview started.\n[19] Ms. Betricia Abou-Hamad, who appeared as a witness at the hearing and was very forthright and credible, together with Ms. Angie Belsher were the interviewers for the formal merit based oral interview. Both of them gave Ms. Nipa exactly the same pass marks for each of the 6 merit criteria at the January 20,, 2020 interview as follows: For merit criteria #1 a pass a mark of 3; for merit criteria #2 a pass mark of 3; for merit criteria #3 a pass mark of 4; for merit criteria #4 a pass mark of 3; for merit criteria #5 a pass mark of 4; and for merit criteria #6 (Ability to communicate effectively orally) a pass mark of 3. As a result Ms. Nipa passed the formal merit based oral interview at this stage according to both interviewers scoring.\n[20] On the scoring form at the formal merit based oral interview Ms. Abou-Hamad, who was very experienced in the selection process and had done many interviews, wrote the following comments about Ms. Nipa\u2019s responses with respect to each of the individual merit criteria assessed: For merit criteria #1 \u201cIdeas were all over the place but did hit points\u201d; For merit criteria #2 \u201cIdeas were all over the place but did mention the key points\u201d; For merit criteria #3 \u201cProvided better order of events\/steps to follow\u201d; For merit criteria #4 \u201cMentioned steps taken. Lost in her chain of thoughts\u201d; For merit criteria #5 there was no comment; For merit criteria #6 there was no comment but the mark was changed from 3 (Pass) to 2 (Fail) after the informal non merit based interview on February 20, 2020 that Ms. Abou-Hamad did not attend. She testified that her pass mark in merit criteria #6 was given because she was able to dissect what Ms. Nipa had said and she could understand her.\n[21] On the scoring form at the formal merit based oral interview Ms. Belsher wrote the following comments about Ms. Nipa\u2019s responses with respect to each individual merit criteria assessed: For merit criteria #1 \u201cideas were all over the place but did touch key point\u201d; For merit criteria #2 \u201ctouched key points but thoughts were all over\u201d; For merit criteria #3 \u201cAnswer was better chronological order of steps to take\u201d; For merit criteria #4 \u201csteps taken are lost in her chain of thought and quality she attribute to herself\u201d; For merit criteria #5 \u201cgood answer\u201d; For merit criteria #6 \u201cCandidate was hard to understand. She did not speak clearly\u201d and the mark was changed from 3 (Pass) to 2 (Fail) after the informal non merit based interview on February 20, 2020 that Ms. Belsher did not attend.\n[22] The comment by Ms. Belsher about merit criteria #6 was the only comment made by either interviewer about merit criteria #6. Ms. Belsher did not attend the hearing but Ms. Abou-Hadad said that Ms. Belsher\u2019s written comment on the scoring form about merit criteria #6 was added when she changed her scoring form for this merit criteria from 3 (a pass) to 2 (a fail) on February 20, 2020.\n[23] For merit criteria #6 the guide for assessing this criteria provided that to score \u201c3 pts: Fair\u201d (a Pass) \u201cCandidate possesses good communication skill: Very few language, grammar or vocabulary issues; Defines messages, important points and issues well, but not as clearly and concisely as possible; Defines complex issues , but with some gaps; Uses some communication tools; A few issues in distinguishing between essential and no-essential information; Adjusts style for various audiences; Addresses diverse views to build consensus\u201d.\n[24] For merit criteria #6 the guide for assessing this criteria provided that to score \u201c2 pts: Poor\u201d (a Fail) \u201cCandidate possesses weak communication skills; A number of languages, grammar or vocabulary issues; Only adequately defines messages, important points and issues; Struggles to define complex issues; Uses only a few communication tools; Struggles to distinguish between essential and non-essential information; Struggles to adjust styles for various audiences, but does attempt to do so; Struggles to address diverse views, but does attempt to do so\u201d.\n[25] Notes of Ms. Nipa\u2019s responses at her formal merit based oral interview were made extensively by both of the interviewers on the scoring form together with the scores and the interviewers comments as set out above.\n[26] Both interviewers attested on the scoring forms to seeing Ms. Nipa\u2019s proof of education including a diploma as a paralegal from Algonquin College and Masters of Law from University of Chittagong, Bangladesh, 1999 and Bangladesh Bar council, 2002.\n[27] At the hearing, because of the passage of time, Ms. Abou-Hamad testified that she could not remember any specific examples relating to any of her negative comments on the scoring form about Ms. Nipa\u2019s formal merit based oral interview or any of the comments she made in her testimony about Ms. Nipa being \u201chard to understand and not speaking clearly\u201d or that her ideas were \u201call over the place and not in sequence\u201d.\n[28] Ms. Abou-Hamad did not see any inconsistency in this case in later changing Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark for merit criteria #6 from a pass to a fail, as her score was very close in this merit criteria between a pass (3) and a fail (2). She was confident in changing the mark in merit criteria #6 even though she did not attend the subsequent non merit based oral interview or receive any specific examples about Ms. Nipa\u2019s alleged communication deficiencies in that interview and even though the marks in each of the other 5 merit criteria that depended on oral communication skills were not changed.\n[29] Ms. Abou-Hamad said she was comfortable with the decision to change the mark even though neither she or Ms. Belsher ever approached their Director, Ms. Brigitte Parent about concerns they had with the formal merit based oral interview. Instead, it was only after Ms. Parent arranged to meet with them following the subsequent informal non merit based oral interview of Ms. Nipa by other interviewers that they expressed their concerns to their Director. She admitted that the reason the informal interview occurred was because there were too many qualified candidates for the available jobs and that if the informal interview had not taken place the mark would not have been changed.\n[30] Ms. Abou-Hamas testified about the very diverse workforce in the ATIP office and in the Department and that she had taken courses in diversity and unconscious discrimination. She came from an ethnic background herself and did not think that there was any unconscious discrimination in the decision to change Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark in this case.\n[31] On February 18, 2020 Ms. Nipa was invited to an informal non merit based oral interview on February 20,2020. Not all of the candidates for the job who passed the oral merit based interview were invited to an informal non merit based oral interview.\n[32] According to the Respondent, the purpose of this interview was to find the \u201cbest fit\u201d for placement of the candidate into the job from the successful pool of candidates from the merit based interview that turned out to be larger than the vacancies for the job. This interview was not intended to be about assessing candidates merit for the job, as that had already taken place in the formal merit based oral interview. \u201cBest fit\u201d was described by the Respondent to the Commission in its investigation of the complaint, in subjective terms, as the person \u201cwho would best fit with the team in terms of energy and how they can meet the department\u2019s specific needs\u2026the energy of the person and the personality that would blend into the team the easiest and fit with the dynamics of the team\u201d.\n[33] Ms. Nipa\u2019s informal non merit based oral interview on February 20 2020 was carried out by Ms. Marie-Josee Ouellette and Ms. Josee Laurin, neither of whom knew who Ms. Nipa was before the interview took place or were aware of her race or ethnicity. Ms. Ouellette was senior to Ms. Lauren who was a witness at the hearing and was a last minute fill in for the informal interview with no previous experience in this type of interview.\n[34] Ms. Laurin who was also a forthright and credible witness testified that she was mainly an observer and little involved at the informal non merit oral interview and could only remember asking a couple of questions of Ms. Nipa. One of her questions was whether Ms. Nipa was bilingual because she felt she was having difficulty understanding Ms. Nipa and her train of thoughts and felt Ms. Nipa had difficulty in conveying her thoughts in English in response to questions. Ms. Nipa was not bilingual in Canada\u2019s official languages and spoke English as a second language.\n[35] The other question that Ms. Laurin asked Ms. Nipa at the interview was when she would be available if a job was offered to her. Ms. Laurin indicated that Ms. Nipa initially had trouble answering this question clearly and responded to it by saying that she had two part time jobs but ultimately was able to answer the question advising that she would need one week notice to her employers. A partially redacted note of this exchange was tendered into evidence but it was the only note that was made by the interviewers of the approximately one half hour long interview.\n[36] Further, Ms. Laurin testified at the hearing that given the lengthy time since the interview she had no other recollection of a specific example of her claim that Ms. Nipa was difficult to understand and to follow her train of thoughts in her responses to questions at the interview. Ms. Laurin and Ms. Abou-Hamud were the only witnesses who had met or spoke to Ms. Nipa.\n[37] Ms. Laurin testified that the informal interview was intended to find the right fit operationally for employment out of the pool of candidates that had passed the formal merit based oral interview. She confirmed that the informal interviews were only held with some of the candidates but not all of the candidates who had passed but would not have been held with any of the candidates if it were not for the fact that there were more candidates who passed than there were job opportunities available.\n[38] Ms. Laurin testified that she was not involved in the decision to change Ms. Nipa\u2019s merit based mark or in any discussion about doing that and only reported to Ms. Parent the facts of the interview as she observed them. She did not find out that Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark had been changed and that she had been eliminated from the selection process until some time later after the complaint was filed in this case and an investigation took place by the Canadian Human Rights Commission.\n[39] Immediately following the non merit based oral informal interview of Ms. Nipa on February 20, 2020, Madames Ouellette and Laurin reported their concerns about Ms. Nipa\u2019s ability to communicate effectively at the interview to Ms. Parent, an experienced Manager who was a forthright and credible witness at the hearing. Ms. Parent had the delegated authority to make final hiring decisions as she was responsible for running the selection process.\n[40] As well, Ms. Genevieve St. Louis, who was an administrative assistant and who did not interview Ms. Nipa but walked her over to both interviews, told Ms. Parent that she had difficulty understanding and communicating with Ms. Nipa.\n[41] The same day as the informal interview took place, Ms. Parent had a discussion with all 4 of the managers who had interviewed Ms. Nipa formally and informally, including Madames Abou-Hamad and Belsher who had passed her at the formal merit based oral interview despite noting some concerns about her responses at that interview. According to Ms. Parent they told her that while they had some difficulty understanding Ms. Nipa they had understood her well enough to pass her at the formal merit based interview.\n[42] At the hearing, Ms. Parent said she accepted Madames Ouellette and Laurin\u2019s advice about not being able to understand or follow Ms. Nipa at the informal interview. Ms. Parent said that she believed that they came to that conclusion because some of Ms. Nipa\u2019s answers didn\u2019t respond to the questions asked at the informal interview but was unable to give any examples of this.\n[43] Ms. Parent testified that as she had never encountered this type of situation before she sought direction from her HR consultant, Mr. Patrick Toupin who she consulted on the same day as the informal interview. Mr. Toupin was a witness at the hearing and was credible and forthright and knowledgeable about rules and laws in the employment area. Mr. Toupin advised Ms. Parent that section 30 of the PSEA obliged her not to hire Ms. Nipa if she felt that Ms. Nipa did not satisfy the merit criteria, even though she had passed all of the merit criteria when the merit based interview was held. Mr. Toupin advised Ms. Parent that she should consider the non merit based interview in making her decision if that showed the candidate did not meet the merit criteria on the whole of the information before her.\n[44] As a result of these discussions and consultations it was agreed that Madames Abou-Hamad and Belsher would change Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark for \u201cability to communicate effectively orally\u201d from Fair\/Pass (ie 3) to Poor\/Fail (ie 2). The result of this change was that the Ms. Nipa was deemed not to have met one of the essential merit criteria and was eliminated from the selection process. She was informed of this by an email dated February 24, 2020 which specifically cited Ms. Nipa\u2019s failure to pass the effective oral communication merit criteria as the reason for her elimination from the process. None of her other merit criteria marks were changed from pass to fail.\n[45] There were 12 successful candidates who entered the pool for jobs in the selection process, 8 of whom were hired out of the pool for jobs. Of the 12 successful candidates who entered the pool, 6 self-identified as visible minorities, 4 of whom were hired out of the pool for jobs.\n[46] Ms. Nipa was the only candidate in this selection process who initially passed all merit criteria in the formal merit based oral interview but whose mark was later changed from a pass to a fail after the informal non merit based oral interview. Ms. Nipa scored the lowest marks of the successful candidates in the formal merit based oral interview and was the only one who passed with a mark of 3 on merit criteria #6 as all of the others scored higher on that merit criteria.\n[47] None of the witnesses, including Ms. Parent, who was the hiring Manager and Mr. Toupin who was the HR expert, both of whom had over 25 years of experience with procurement process, had ever participated in or known about a selection process where a candidate\u2019s pass mark for an essential merit criteria achieved at a formal merit based oral interview was later changed to a fail mark following an informal non merit based oral interview resulting in the elimination of the candidate from the selection process.\n[48] None of the Respondent\u2019s employees involved with this matter told Ms. Nipa at either interview about their concerns respecting her ability to communicate effectively orally, though she later became aware of these concerns when she was advised of her elimination from the selection process. As a result she was surprised and upset with her elimination from the selection process.\n[49] According to Ms. Parent and the other Respondent witnesses, the ATIP office specifically and the Respondent generally had a very diverse work force with many races and ethnic and national origins represented. There was training and courses provided for the employees in diversity in the work place and in unconscious bias and discrimination. There was statistical evidence produced by the Respondent to show that visible minorities presence in their workforce exceeded their workforce availability. In particular, candidates with the same ethnic origin as Ms. Nipa were more likely to succeed in job competitions than the average candidate and South Asian people were hired by the Respondent at a greater rate than their workplace availability.\n[50] Ms. Nipa represented herself in a forthright and credible manner at the hearing and was the only witness who gave evidence on her behalf. I was able to follow and understand Ms. Nipa in her presentations, testimony and in her cross examination of Respondent witnesses and in her oral submissions at the hearing. She seemed to me to be adequately focused and organized at all times at the hearing. The hearing was held in English which is Ms. Nipa\u2019s second language. At times I had to orient myself a little to her accent and manner of speaking to understand her and had to ask her to repeat herself to get responsive answers to certain questions, but overall I was able to understand and follow her.\n[51] In reading the notes Ms. Nipa made in preparation for the formal interview and in reading the detailed notes prepared by Madames Abou-Hassad and Belsher of her responses at that interview, in response to the questions in each of the merit criteria scenarios, I was unable to find examples of her being \u201call over the place\u201d or \u201clost in her chain of thoughts\u201d or \u201chard to understand\u201d at the interview. That said, obviously I didn\u2019t hear her at either of the interviews and there was no audio record of the interviews. As noted there were no notes made of the informal non merit based oral interview.\n[52] Ms. Nipa\u2019s evidence at the hearing was that she felt that the two managers, Madames Ouellette and Laurin, who interviewed her in the non merit based oral interview, unlawfully, unethically and intentionally influenced the other managers to change the mark that she had received for the effective oral communication from a pass to a fail based on discriminatory considerations, namely her race and or national or ethnic origin.\n[53] Ms. Nipa claimed in her evidence that Madames Ouellette and Laurin were biased against her and that the informal interview was set up to eliminate her from the selection process with a fabricated story by the interviewers that they were not able to understand or follow her during the interview. She testified that they made no notes of her answers to their questions during their lengthy interview of her, except for one very short note that indicated she was not bilingual and that she needed one week notice from her 2 part time jobs to take the job if she was hired.\n[54] Ms. Nipa disputed the suggestion that Ms. St. Louis, who was not an interviewer, would have been unable to understand her as she was able to follow all of the instructions from Ms. St. Louis for attending and participating in the interviews.\n[55] To Ms. Nipa, it was inconsistent and contrary to the selection process that was supposed to be based on merit, to be eliminated from the process on February 24, 2020 for failing the effective oral communication merit based criteria following the informal non merit based oral interview, despite having initially passed each of the essential merit based criteria, including the effective oral communication merit criteria at the January 20, 2020 formal merit based oral interview. To her, the changing of her mark under these circumstances demonstrated discrimination against Ms. Nipa because of her race and ethnicity.\n[56] Further, in Ms. Nipa\u2019s opinion, it was inconsistent and did not make sense to her that none of her other essential merit criteria passing marks were changed from pass to fail despite the fact that passing all of the other merit based criteria depended in each case on her having effective oral communication skills that were to be assessed in relation to her responses in each of the other essential merit criteria.\n[57] In Ms. Nipa\u2019s view, it was unethical and discriminatory that her elimination from the selection process was based on subjective non merit based \u201cbest fit\u201d considerations at an informal non merit based oral interview after she had passed all merit based criteria at the formal merit based oral interview and had submitted all the information required to demonstrate her qualifications. According to her no specific evidence was produced by the Respondent to support their general criticisms of her communication skills at either interview.\n[58] Also, Ms. Nipa felt that it was inconsistent that copious notes could be made of her responses to the questions in the formal merit based oral interview if she was not able to be understood by the interviewers who wrote the notes and initially passed her in all of the merit criteria including effective oral communication skills.\n[59] According to Ms. Nipa, as a result of the discrimination by the Respondent in changing her mark and eliminating her from the selection process based on her race and ethnicity, she suffered hurt feelings and a loss of her self worth and dignity.\n[60] Ms. Nipa said she has been a Canadian citizen for over 15 years and had never before been told that she could not be understood. She has both university and community college degrees and diplomas in English as well as excellent work references. She feels that she was unlawfully prevented from realizing an opportunity that she was qualified for as well as other potential opportunities in the future for which she wants to be compensated and placed in a Level PM-01 job. She has currently qualified for pools for some other jobs with the government.\n[61] The 4 witnesses for the Respondent at the hearing all denied any discriminatory behaviour or racial or ethnic biases against Ms. Nipa. There was no evidence of any overt or intentional racist comments or conduct by the Respondent\u2019s employees against Ms. Nipa. The evidence included statistical evidence of a diverse workplace trained in discrimination without any indication of hiring biases against south Asian people or of their underrepresentation in the workforce. The witnesses said that they changed her mark and eliminated her from the selection process because of concerns that they had with respect to her ability to communicate effectively orally at the interviews and the advice they received from Mr. Toupin.\nIII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [62] Section 7 of the CHRA provides, in part, that it is a discriminatory practice, directly or indirectly to refuse to employ any individual or in the course of employment to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination. Race and national or ethnic origin are among the prohibited grounds of discrimination included in section 3 of the CHRA.\n[63] Section 30 of the PSEA provides, in part, that appointments to the public service shall be based on merit which requires that the person designated to appoint must be satisfied that the essential qualifications for the job are met by the person to be appointed.\n[64] A complainant alleging infringement of the CHRA bears the onus of proving a prima facie case of discrimination. The applicable standard of proof is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. To discharge the onus a complainant must establish a \u201cconnection\u201d to a prohibited ground under the CHRA. (see Quebec (Commission des droits de la personne et droits de la Jeunesse) v. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier Aerospace Training Centre), 2015 SCC 39 at para 65 (Bombardier).\n[65] A prima facie case is \u201cone which covers the allegations made and which, if they are believed, is complete and sufficient to justify a verdict in the complainant\u2019s favour in the absence of an answer from the respondent-employer.\u201d (see Ontario Human Rights Commission and O\u2019Malley v. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 SCR 536 at para 28.)\n[66] In order to prove a prima facie case of discrimination, the test that the complainant must generally satisfy is that: i) the complainant has one or more characteristics protected from discrimination under the CHRA, such as race, national or ethnic origin; ii) the complainant was subjected to adverse treatment or disadvantage; and iii) one or more of the complainant\u2019s protected characteristic(s) was a factor, but not necessarily the only factor in the adverse treatment or disadvantage. (see Stewart v. Elk Valley Coal Corp., 2017 SCC 30 (CanLII) at para 69 citing Moore v. British Columbia (Education), 2012 SCC 61, [2012] 3 SCR 360 at para 33 and Bombardier, at paras 60-63.)\n[67] In determining whether a complainant with protected characteristics has satisfied the second two parts of the test in a case under section 7 of the CHRA involving a complaint of discrimination in a selection board\u2019s decision, a Tribunal is not required to assess the complainant\u2019s qualifications and experience in absolute terms, not even in relation to other candidates. The Tribunal is not sitting as a selection board in such a case, nor is it exercising appellate jurisdiction in respect of the selection board\u2019s decision, Rather, the Tribunal is required to assess the decision-making process of the selection board in order to determine whether the complainant was adversely impacted by the decision and whether the complainant\u2019s protected characteristics or a combination thereof played a role in the selection board\u2019s decision-making process. (see Turner v. Canada Border Services Agency, 2018 CHRT 1, at para. 40).\n[68] The Tribunal is not mandated to decide on the effectiveness, the correctness or the accuracy of the respondent\u2019s selection process, but rather to determine whether this process was tainted with discrimination. The presence of irregularities in the hiring process, even where it is shown that the hiring process was \u201cseriously flawed\u201d, is not evidence of discrimination. The Tribunal does not have the power to monitor and supervise the operation and staffing process under the PSEA. The Tribunal\u2019s role is not to determine whether irregularities in the hiring process exist rather the Tribunal\u2019s role is to determine whether these irregularities were motivated by a prohibited ground of discrimination. (see Salem v. Canadian National Railway, 2008 CHRT 13 at para. 72; Dokis v. Dokis Indian Band, 1995 CanLII 10394 (CHRT); Kibale v. Transport Canada, 1985 CanLII 90 (CHRT).\n[69] A complainant is not required to prove that the respondent intended to discriminated in order to establish a prima facie case as some discrimination involves multiple factors and is unconscious. Indeed, it is often said that discrimination is not a practice that would ordinarily be displayed openly or even practiced intentionally. As a result, the Tribunal must examine all of the circumstances, invariably often involving circumstantial evidence, that both support and undermine the allegation of discrimination, to determine if there exists what the Tribunal has called the \u201csubtle scent of discrimination\u201d. (see Bombardier at paras. 40-41; Basi v. Canadian National Railway, 1988 CanLII 108 (CHRT); Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396 at paras. 72 and 8; British Columbia (Public Service Employees Relations Commission) v. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 SCR at para. 29).\n[70] Discrimination need only one factor in the respondent\u2019s decision not to hire for a complainant to be successful under the CHRA. The Tribunal is tasked with discerning whether discrimination was a factor in failure to hire. To do so the Tribunal must consider all of the evidence, make findings of fact and determine whether the inference that may be drawn from the facts supports a finding of discrimination on the balance of probabilities. However, there has to be a nexus between the conduct under scrutiny and a prohibited ground of discrimination. The nexus can be inferred through circumstantial evidence, but the inference of discrimination must be more probable than other possible inferences. In making the inference, the fact at issue must be proved by other facts. Each piece of evidence need not alone lead to the conclusion. The pieces of evidence, each by themselves insufficient, are combined to provide a basis for the inference that the fact at issue exists. The finding of discrimination by the Tribunal can be based upon circumstantial evidence as well as direct, anecdotal and statistical evidence. (see Khiamal v. Canada, 2009 FC 495 at paras. 80-84).\n[71] If a complainant establishes a prima facie case, the onus shifts to the respondent to show by way of a reasonable explanation that either discrimination did not occur or the conduct was not discriminatory. Any such explanation must be credible, and not a mere pretext or mask for discrimination. (see Bombardier at para. 37.)\nIV. ANALYSIS [72] Whether or not it was discriminatory, the decision by the Respondent to change Ms. Nipa\u2019s pass mark and eliminate her from the selection process was highly unusual and possibly irregular and flawed from a process point of view. None of the Respondent\u2019s very experienced witnesses had ever known of or been involved with changing a mark and eliminating a candidate from a job selection process.\n[73] As well, the decision was clearly hurtful for Ms. Nipa and had an adverse impact on her. Ms. Nipa, who is from Bangladesh, was not made aware of her elimination until after the second interview and was understandably surprised and upset by the result as acknowledged by the Respondent. It was a blow to her self worth and dignity.\n[74] In light of the merit requirements of section 30 of the PSEA that was used by the Respondent to support its position, the decision to change Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark and eliminate her from the selection process as a result of an informal non merit based oral interview that was supposed to be about the subjective \u201cbest fit\u201d assessment for the job rather than merit based, also appears to be somewhat contradictory. The informal interview was not provided for in the process information made available to the candidates and was only held for some of the candidates because there were too many successful candidates in the pool from the merit based interview. Had the informal non merit based oral interview not been held, Ms. Nipa\u2019s mark would not have been changed and she would not have been eliminated from the selection process.\n[75] It is also seems surprising and unfortunate, given the unusual circumstances, that with one exception, no clear and specific examples to support the general negative comments made by the interviewers about their difficulty in following Ms. Nipa\u2019s responses could be remembered at the hearing or were documented by the interviewers in either of the interviews, including the first interview where copious notes were made of her responses. The interviewers must have been able to follow what Ms. Nipa was saying well enough to make their notes.\n[76] The one exception was the very brief note made by Ms. Laurin of Ms. Nipa\u2019s response to the question about her availability to start the job if selected. It is unclear from that note what was actually asked and answered and how it supports the negative comments about her oral communication skills.\n[77] As well, it seems odd that the decision to change her mark and fail Ms. Nipa for poor oral communication skills in an entry level job selection process was made despite very positive references about her work in Canada that were accepted by the Respondent as well as her university degrees and Canadian community college diploma in legal studies that were also accepted by the Respondent.\n[78] It also seems curious that the passing marks for all of the other 5 essential merit criteria that were assessed on an objective basis and depended on Ms. Nipa\u2019s effective oral communication skills to achieve a pass mark were not changed when merit criteria #6 was changed from a pass to a fail following the non merit based oral interview.\n[79] Finally, in retrospect, in view of the very unusual circumstances in this case, one has to wonder whether it would have been more desirable for the Respondent to first reach out to Ms. Nipa for third oral interview by either Ms. Parent or a different panel of interviewers to recheck her oral communication skills before making the change to her mark and eliminating her from the selection process.\n[80] All of that being said, as the cases cited above indicate, it is not the Tribunal\u2019s role to determine the adequacy or the merits of a respondent\u2019s hiring procedures and choice of candidates, even in unusual and possibly flawed selection processes. However, in such circumstances, where subjective criteria are being used in a hiring decision, it is necessary to more carefully scrutinize a hiring decision to determine whether the decision was tinged with discrimination on any of the alleged grounds of discrimination.\n[81] Despite the unusual circumstances in this case and the possible irregularities that took place as referred to above, in weighing all of the evidence in this case, I find that there is no direct or indirect evidence establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that the Respondent intended to discriminate against Ms. Nipa or consciously did so. There is no evidence that displays any overt acts of discrimination on the part of the Respondent\u2019s employees against Ms. Nipa.\n[82] Further, I accept the Respondent\u2019s witnesses testimony that they did not think that they were discriminating against Ms. Nipa when they changed her mark and eliminated her from the selection process. I believe that they genuinely felt that she did not possess the effective oral communication skills that were required for her to be hired on a merit basis to do the job according to section 30 of the PSEA and that they did not intend to discriminate against her.\n[83] Even though the assessment of merit criteria #6 was subjective, the reason for the Respondent\u2019s decision was not, in my opinion, a pretext to discriminate against Ms. Nipa. I accept the Respondent\u2019s evidence that the difference between a pass (3) mark and a fail (2) mark was very close. Given that Ms. Nipa had the lowest mark in this essential merit criteria and that all 4 of the interviewers had generally the same view of her weak oral communication skills, the decision seems to me to have been reasonable.\n[84] I also accept the Respondent\u2019s evidence about the broad diversity in its workforce and the training employees received about discrimination, including unconscious discrimination. This supports my view that this was not a workplace where discrimination in hiring normally took place and therefore it was unlikely that the Respondent\u2019s employees intended to discriminate against Ms. Nipa in this case. One of the interviewer witnesses self identified as an ethnic visible minority. The uncontradicted evidence was that the Respondent did not disfavour the hiring of south Asians. Half of the successful candidates in the selection process were visible minorities who had passed the formal interview and one third of those were hired into the jobs by the Respondent.\n[85] Notwithstanding my finding that there was no intent to discriminate against Ms. Nipa, given the unusual circumstances in this case as referred to above, it is incumbent upon me to review the evidence to try to determine whether there may have been unconscious or unintentional bias in the decision to change Ms. Nipa\u2019s pass mark to a fail mark and eliminate her from the selection process. In other words, whether the employees who participated in the decision unconsciously held negative stereotypical biases about Ms. Nipa based on her race or ethnicity that may have been a factor in their decision.\n[86] Needless to say, it is an extremely difficult and uncertain task to try to determine whether there may have been unconscious bias by the Respondent\u2019s employees in this case who claimed not to be biased against Ms. Nipa, but who wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize their own biases if they were held unconsciously. The unusual and even irregular conduct of the Respondent\u2019s employees in this case may have been wrong and unfair but does not alone amount to there having been unconscious bias and discrimination in the decision to eliminate Ms. Nipa from the selection process.\n[87] At best, in the absence of intentional acts of discrimination, I can only examine the conduct under scrutiny to determine whether, more probably than not, an inference can be drawn of a nexus between the conduct under scrutiny and a prohibited ground of discrimination alleged by Ms. Nipa, based upon negative stereotypical biases unconsciously held by the decision makers in this case.\n[88] I am not able to draw such an inference in this case based upon my review of the evidence. There was no evidence presented about any negative stereotypical biases generally prevalent in society against persons of Ms. Nipa\u2019s race and or ethnicity or national origin .\n[89] On the other hand, as previously noted, there was statistical evidence presented about ample diversity in the Respondent\u2019s workplace and workforce including in the ATIP office where the events of this case took place. The evidence showed that the Respondent\u2019s percentage of visible minority employees exceeded their workforce availability and that candidates with the same ethnic origin as Ms. Nipa were more likely to succeed in job competitions than the average candidate. 4 of the 8 successful candidates in this competition self-identified as visible minorities.\n[90] All of the interviewers had expressed concerns about Ms. Nipa\u2019s oral communication skills and even though she originally received a pass mark it was on the borderline of a fail mark and the lowest mark achieved by any of the candidates.\n[91] The decision was a spontaneous reaction to what the interviewers perceived to be Ms. Nipa\u2019s poor oral communication skills that they were told must be taken into consideration in the hiring process by virtue of section 30 of the PSEA, irrespective of Ms. Nipa\u2019s race and or her ethnic or national origin.\nV. DECISION AND ORDER\n[92] For the foregoing reasons I find that Ms. Nipa\u2019s complaint has not been substantiated and is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

OVERVIEW [1] The Complainant, Nicholas Dinardo, has brought a motion requesting the following:\na) An order requiring the Respondent, Correctional Services Canada (CSC), to produce the documents set out in Schedule A of this Ruling by September 30, 2023;\nb) An order compelling CSC to produce the documents that it has agreed to produce, as set out in Schedule B of this Ruling, by August 31, 2023; and\nc) An order requiring CSC to perform a further search for relevant videos of use of force incidents and to produce the videos it locates by August 31, 2023.\n[2] The motion was heard on August 16, 2023.\n[3] The Complainant in this case is Nicholas Dinardo. Mx. Dinardo self-identifies as an Indigenous, Jewish, Two-Spirit transfeminine woman with diagnosed mental health disabilities, who uses gender-neutral pronouns.\n[4] Mx. Dinardo has filed two human rights complaints against CSC before this Tribunal (Tribunal file numbers T2747\/12321 and HR-DP-2868-22). The Tribunal has consolidated the two complaints to be heard in a single inquiry. In these complaints, Mx. Dinardo is alleging past and ongoing harassment and discrimination in the provision of correctional services.\n[5] The hearing for this matter is set to begin on November 6, 2023.\n[6] The Tribunal and the parties have been diligent in their efforts to begin the hearing in November to limit the psychological impacts of Mx. Dinardo\u2019s testimony, given the nature of much of their testimony and their vulnerabilities as well as their imminent release from federal custody. To preserve the November hearing dates and to allow the parties sufficient time to prepare for the hearing, there is a need for a ruling on this motion as soon as possible. Therefore, the reasons for this ruling are succinct.\nII. REASONS [7] CONSIDERING the motion filed on July 7, 2023;\n[8] CONSIDERING the written submissions filed by the parties as well as their oral submissions heard on August 16, 2023;\n[9] CONSIDERING that disclosure by CSC has advanced significantly but is not yet complete and that there is disagreement between the parties on several disclosure requests;\n[10] CONSIDERING that CSC did not contest the relevancy, or arguable relevancy, of the Complainant\u2019s disclosure requests in its submissions on this motion;\n[11] CONSIDERING that any confidentiality concerns caused by the disclosure and eventual production of certain documents can be addressed through confidentiality orders of this Tribunal;\nA. Re: Schedule B [12] CONSIDERING that CSC agrees that the requested documents listed in Schedule B are at least arguably relevant to the complaints, that they have already begun disclosure on these categories of documents and that they agree to continue disclosure until complete (subject to ongoing disclosure requirements);\nB. Re: Schedule A \u2013 A(1) [13] CONSIDERING that, for the years 2018\u20132021, CSC produced a document to show the information requested in Schedule A-A(1) and that, on consent between the parties, CSC has agreed to disclose statistics in regard to the sought-after information by September 30 for the years 2021\u20132022 and 2022\u20132023;\n[14] CONSIDERING that, during the hearing, the parties agreed that to ensure that CSC has sufficient time to collect the required statistics, it would be appropriate to provide CSC four more weeks and that this extra delay would not affect the November hearing dates.\nC. Re: Schedule A \u2013 C(2) and (D(1) [15] CONSIDERING that, on consent of all parties, CSC has agreed to compile and disclose statistics that provide the information requested in Schedule A-C(2) and D(1), without the need to provide the source documents from which the information was obtained;\nD. Re: Schedule A \u2013 E(1) and E(2) [16] CONSIDERING that CSC agrees to disclose the documents requested under Schedule A-E(1) and E(2);\nE. Re: Schedule A \u2013 B(1) [17] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 B(1), described as:\n1. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of assaults against gender diverse people in CSC custody, broken down by year and type of institution (men\u2019s or women\u2019s).\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[18] CONSIDERING that CSC does not track such statistics and that over 20,000 documents would need to be produced to compile such information over the past five fiscal years;\n[19] CONSIDERING the need for the Tribunal to consider the principle of proportionality when ordering disclosure (Temate v Public Health Agency of Canada, 2022 CHRT 31 at para 9; 8-16);\n[20] CONSIDERING that three years of disclosure would be sufficient to allow the Complainant to fully and amply present their case before the Tribunal while respecting the proportionality principle (see Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, section 50(1) and Brickner v Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28 at para 7) and that by choosing the years 2018, 2019 and 2022, the information should avoid major anomalies that could be caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on correctional services;\n[21] CONSIDERING that it is also possible to restrict the geographical breadth of the disclosure, while still allowing the Complainant to mount a full case and respect the principle of proportionality by choosing certain regions across the country;\n[22] CONSIDERING that the production of documents from the Pacific, Prairie and Ontario regions of CSC would provide for a significant enough sample from across the country to allow the Complainant to make a full case while respecting the principle of proportionality;\n[23] CONSIDERING that in cases where the disclosure would result in a high volume of documents, particularly documents that contain sensitive information such as in the present complaints, it may be appropriate to provide an option to the Respondent to either produce the relevant documents to allow the Complainant to compile the needed information or compile the statistics to demonstrate the information requested by the Complainant (Brickner v Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2018 CHRT 2);\n[24] CONSIDERING that the Complainant and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) agree to the production of statistics instead of the underlying source documents for this request;\nRe: Schedule A \u2013 B(2)\n[25] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 B(2), described as:\n2. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of grievances filed by people in institutions designated for men regarding transphobia and\/or harassment or discrimination on the basis of their gender identity.\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[26] CONSIDERING that CSC does not track such statistics and that over 6,500 documents would need to be produced to compile such information over the past five fiscal years;\n[27] CONSIDERING paragraphs 19-24 of this Ruling;\nF. Re: Schedule A \u2013 B(3) [28] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 B(3), described as:\n3. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of violations of individualized protocols in CSC institutions designated for men.\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[29] CONSIDERING that, despite the relevancy of the information, CSC has provided evidence that it does not track the requested information and that there are no documents available that would allow such statistics to be compiled;\nG. Re: Schedule A \u2013 B(4) [30] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 B(4), described as:\n34. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of gender diverse people in prison who received correctional programming aligned with their gender identity and the number who did not, broken down by the nature of the institution (designated for men vs. designated for women) where those individuals were in custody.\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[31] CONSIDERING that CSC produced a report which outlines the requested information up to March 13, 2020;\n[32] CONSIDERING that, after March 13, 2020, there are no reports or studies providing the requested information and that thousands of documents would have to be produced to compile the requested information for March 31, 2020, onwards;\n[33] CONSIDERING that, in the interest of proportionality, the information provided in the report up to March 31, 2020, is sufficient to allow the Complainant to present a full case, while respecting the principle of proportionality as well as the resources of the Tribunal and the parties;\nH. Re: Schedule A \u2013 C(1) [34] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 C(1), described as:\n1. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of people in prison placed in observation cells or quiet room cells, for how long, and the conditions of confinement during those placements including daily time out of cell and daily meaningful human contact.\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[35] CONSIDERING that CSC provided evidence that it does not track the requested statistics and that there are no documents in CSC\u2019s possession that would allow the compilation of the requested information in regard to quiet room information, length out of observation cells and quiet rooms, daily time out of cells, or meaningful contact;\n[36] CONSIDERING that CSC provided evidence that it tracks the number of inmates in observation cells and for how long;\n[37] CONSIDERING that CSC stated during its submissions that, if the Tribunal requires disclosure in regard to C(1), it would prefer to create and provide the relevant statistics instead of the individual documents, which contain voluminous sensitive and private information, and that the Complainant and Commission agree to this approach;\nI. Re: Schedule A \u2013 C(3) [38] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 C(3), described as:\n3. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of times officers have conducted a noncompliant strip search and\/or cut someone\u2019s clothes off pursuant to placement in an observation cell or Pinel restraints.\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[39] CONSIDERING that CSC provided evidence that it only tracks searches that lead to contraband and that, to produce sufficient documents to obtain the requested information over five years, CSC would need to provide approximately 9,000 multi-page incident packages.\n[40] CONSIDERING paragraphs 19-24 of this Ruling;\nRe: Schedule A \u2013 C(4)\n[41] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 C(4), described as:\n4. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the number of self-harm incidents, including whether these incidents occurred in SIUs and\/or in maximum security institutions.\nis relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints;\n[42] CONSIDERING that CSC provided evidence that it does not track such information and that it would need to produce around 7000 multi-page incident reports of self-harm to allow the requested information over five years to be compiled;\n[43] CONSIDERING paragraphs 19\u201324 of this Ruling;\nJ. Re: Schedule A \u2013 D(2), (3) and (4) [44] CONSIDERING the Complainant makes the following requests at Schedule A \u2013 D(2), (3) and (4):\n2. Documents sufficient to show the average cost of a cell extraction by the Emergency Response Team.\n3. Documents sufficient to show for the last five years the number of strip searches performed each year.\n4. CSC research and analysis related to the effectiveness of strip searches for finding contraband.\n[45] CONSIDERING that CSC provided evidence that it does not track this information and that there are no documents in existence that would allow such information to be compiled;\n[46] CONSIDERING that parties cannot be ordered to produce documents that do not exist or to make documents for the sole purpose of disclosure (Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137, Rule 6 and Gaucher v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2005 CHRT 42 at para. 17);\nK. Re: Schedule A \u2013 D(5) [47] CONSIDERING that the information sought in the documents requested at Schedule A \u2013 D(5), described as:\n5. Documents sufficient to show for each of the last five fiscal years: the average number of days a person in prison was required to wait to receive a response to a Privacy Act request for records documenting forced used against them.\nis arguably relevant to the issues raised and the remedies requested in the complaints, albeit with limited probative value;\n[48] CONSIDERING that CSC provided evidence that it does not track this information and that it would have to produce approximately 144 documents and\/or video packages (each package approximately 20\u2013150 pages) to allow such information to be compiled for the past five years; and\n[49] CONSIDERING the need to respect the principle of proportionality and the need to consider the probative value of burdensome and voluminous disclosure requests (Brickner v Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28 at paras 5-6 and 8);\nL. Re: Further Search for Videos [50] CONSIDERING that the Respondent does not contest the request of the Complainant to a carry out a further search for relevant videos of use of force incidents regarding the Complainant and to produce any videos it locates by August 31, 2023;\nIII. ORDER [51] The Tribunal therefore allows the Complainant\u2019s motion in part and orders that:\na) on consent, the Respondent produce the following documents in Schedule B by September 30, 2023:\nB1.

OVERVIEW [1] This is a ruling on the motion of the Respondent, Canada Revenue Agency, dated June 13, 2023 for an order that the complaint in this matter be dismissed for abuse of process.\n[2] The complainant, Robin Holmen, filed her complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) on January 11, 2019 (\u201cComplaint\u201d) alleging that the Respondent, as her employer, discriminated against her on the grounds of family status, marital status, sex and disability by treating her in an adverse differential manner and by failing to provide her with a harassment-free work environment, contrary to the Canadian Human Rights Act (\u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[3] On August 1, 2022 Ms. Holmen provided her Statement of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) in which she raised new allegations not included in her Complaint and included four notices of motion as well as documents not listed in her list of documents which itself was left blank.\n[4] Subsequently, the Commission, the Respondent and the Tribunal all respectfully and genuinely attempted to assist and cooperate with Ms. Holmen, who was self-represented, to better understand the purpose of the Statement of Particulars so that it could be amended, in a manner that would allow the matter to go forward.\n[5] Ms. Holmen did not provide an amended Statement of Particulars despite having advised that she would aim to do so by October of 2022. On May 9, 2023 the Tribunal attempted to set up a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) in July or August but Ms. Holmen responded by emailing the parties that under no circumstances would she be \u201cparticipating in a corrupted judicial process\u201d. On the same day, the Commission advised the parties that it was completely withdrawing from the case.\n[6] Ms. Holmen sent various emails to the parties and the Tribunal making vile, lewd, disgusting, disrespectful and wholly inappropriate comments, allegations, commentary and threats directed at various individuals including, counsel and employees of the Respondent, Commission staff, Tribunal Registry staff and the Tribunal Member.\n[7] Ms. Holmen failed to respond to the motion by August 18, 2023 the date set by the Tribunal.\n[8] The issue is whether or not Ms. Holmen\u2019s conduct in failing to respond to a request for a CMCC and in failing to respond to this motion as well as her behaviour towards the parties and the Tribunal, undermines the integrity of the judicial process to such a degree that it is an abuse of the process and her complaint ought to be dismissed.\n[9] As it is evident that Ms. Holmen is not participating any further in this matter and has engaged in abusive behaviour to the parties, the Tribunal and the process, the Tribunal has no alternative but to dismiss her complaint.\nII. BACKGROUND [10] On May 31, 2022 the Commission referred the Complaint to the Tribunal. The basis for the referral was to institute an inquiry into the allegations that took place between 2014 to 2017.\n[11] As noted above, in her August 1, 2022 SOP Ms. Holmen raised new allegations not included in her Complaint that was referred to the Tribunal by the Commission. In addition, she included four motions. One of the motions asked the Tribunal to express an opinion with respect to Canada\u2019s alleged non-compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) (\u201cUnited Nations Convention\u201d) and another asked the Tribunal to add Canada as a Respondent to this case.\n[12] As a result, on August 3, 2022 the Respondent requested that the Tribunal to convene a CMCC to discuss the apparent expansion of the scope of the Complaint.\n[13] In response to the Respondent\u2019s request, Ms. Holmen emailed the Tribunal and the parties, and accused counsel for the Respondent of having associates in Edmonton who \u201csexually assaulted, gang talked and kidnapped her\u201d. She further provided her availability for the CMCC and added that this was in presumption that she would not be \u201cadded to the ranks of the missing and murdered women in the meantime, for violating the Government [sic] of Canada\u2019s white patriarchal right to rape, sexually assault, stalk and terrorize anyone they please, freely at will and on command.\u201d\n[14] On September 1, 2022, the Tribunal sent a letter to the parties with information to assist regarding the purpose of an SOP and issues raised in Ms. Holmen\u2019s SOP and notices of motion. The Tribunal noted that a Complainant cannot raise it the SOP new or unrelated allegations outside of the scope of the Complaint that was investigated by the Commission and referred to the Tribunal. The Tribunal further noted that it did not have jurisdiction to provide an opinion on the United Nations Convention and that Canada was already a Respondent in the case.\n[15] The CMCC was held on September 22, 2022. The Tribunal reviewed its September 1 letter to the parties and made comments to try to assist Ms. Holmen to understand the purpose of an SOP and help her make amendments to her SOP in order to allow the process to move forward. As Ms. Holmen was self-represented, counsel for the Commission offered to assist her with the preparation of an amended SOP. She agreed to speak to counsel for the Commission in the coming days and to revise the SOP by October 22, 2022, although no firm date was set by the Tribunal in order to allow her sufficient time.\n[16] Despite attempts by counsel for the Commission to engage Ms. Holmen in discussions to assist her with the revision of her SOP, Ms. Holmen did not respond and did not make any amendments.\n[17] On May 5, 2023 the Respondent wrote to the parties and the Tribunal requesting that either the Tribunal set a date for the delivery by Ms. Holmen of an amended SOP or set up a further CMCC to discuss moving forward with the case.\n[18] In response to the Respondent\u2019s May 5, 2023 correspondence, Ms. Holmen sent two emails to the parties, the Tribunal and other members of the public, alleging that counsel for the Respondent did not \u201cwant his victims to have a voice\u201d and that \u201cyou white Whore of Apartheid savages are in front of the regulator\u201d. Ms. Holmen also questioned whether counsel for the Respondent had ordered the kidnapping of her children and threatened to shake his \u201cmutherfucking house down in front of the whole planet while you face retaliation and criminal conspiracy charges.\u201d\n[19] On May 9, 2023 the Tribunal emailed the parties to request a CMCC on available dates in July or August.\n[20] On the same date, counsel for the Commission wrote the parties advising that the Commission would no longer be participating in the Tribunal\u2019s process including mediation, case management or hearings.\n[21] On the same date Ms. Holmen responded to the Tribunal\u2019s request for a CMCC by email to the parties and stated that, under no circumstances would she be \u201cparticipating in a corrupted judicial process.\u201d She further accused all the parties of colluding to \u201cobstruct and pervert this matter from beginning to end\u201d; accused the Tribunal member of \u201cplanning to finally obstruct and defeat me in having regulators examine his professional conduct as the senior-most CHRT panel member by holding my children at some undisclosed location\u201d and of holding her children ransom; and threatened that Minister Lametti would decapitate all of the recipients of her email for advancing their \u201cconflict of interest and political agendas.\u201d\n[22] In response, on the same date, the Tribunal wrote to the parties to advise that as Ms. Holmen had refused to participate it would not be possible to hold a CMCC as requested by the Respondent and that the Respondent may consider whether it wishes to bring a motion to dismiss.\n[23] Following receipt of the Tribunal\u2019s correspondence, Ms. Holmen sent seven emails to the parties, the Tribunal, the Deputy Executive Director and General Counsel for the Respondent and other members of the public. These seven emails contained false accusations, vile and lewd commentary and threats against counsel for the Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s Registry Officer, the Tribunal Member and others. Among the things that she wrote in these emails were that the Tribunal Member was a \u201cdirty corruptible man\u201d and that the Registry Officer was a \u201cmanipulative cunt colonial whore kidnapper\u201d.\n[24] Following the Respondent\u2019s filing of this motion on June 13, 2023, Ms. Holmen responded on June 14th and June 19th with emails indicating she was hospitalized, without legal representation and seeking mediation.\n[25] In its reply of June 20, 2023 to Ms. Holmen\u2019s correspondence, the Respondent pointed out that Ms. Holmen was continuing her previous behaviour by attacking various people and entities including accusing \u201cthe Commission of being corrupt and incompetent\u201d and continuing to \u201cwhite-pass rape and racism\u201d and talking about judicial interference, \u201cpolice state abuse\u201d and general \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d.\n[26] The Respondent also pointed out in its reply that Ms. Holmen\u2019s correspondence continued to make allegations and raise issues that had nothing to do with the complaint in this case including alleged wrongdoings by the RCMP, wrongful dismissal and employment insurance and statements about individuals not referred to in the complaint. In addition, the Respondent indicated that there was no basis or proof of the claim by the Ms. Holmen of her hospitalization and that her request for mediation was the first time she had sought this while the case was before the Tribunal. The Respondent refused to agree to Ms. Holmen\u2019s request for mediation.\n[27] Finally, the Respondent in its reply stated that with respect to the matter of legal representation, Ms. Holmen had never before raised this issue and did not avail herself of the offer of the Commission to assist her in amending her SOP. However, the Respondent stated that \u201cif she does wish to retain legal counsel she should be given the opportunity to do so. This would be for the limited purpose of responding to the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this Complaint as this must be dealt with before anything else can occur in this matter. It is suggested that the Complainant be given until July 31, 2023 to retain counsel, and for that counsel to make submissions on the motion failing which the Respondent\u2019s motion will be considered by the Tribunal without further delay\u201d.\n[28] On June 26, 2023 the Tribunal emailed the parties to advise that Ms. Holmen had until August 18, 2023 to retain legal counsel to assist in providing a response that meaningfully responded to the Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss and if she did not do so, or that her counsel did not make submissions by August 18, 2023, the Tribunal would decide the motion without further delay.\n[29] The Tribunal did not receive any information that Ms. Holmen had retained legal counsel by August 18, 2023 nor did it receive any further submissions with respect to this motion.\nIII. LEGAL FRAMEWORK [30] The Tribunal may make an order to dismiss a complaint for non-compliance with the Canadian Human Rights Rules of Procedure, 2021 (\u201cRules\u201d), vexatious conduct, or abuse of process, pursuant to Rules 9 and 10 of the Rules.\n[31] Litigants in the Federal Court may be barred from continuing with their action where they have proceeded in a vexatious manner. A litigant may be considered vexatious where they have made unsubstantiated allegations of impropriety against the opposite party, legal counsel and\/or the Court; refused to abide by rules and orders of the Court; or used scandalous language in pleadings before the Court. Such vexatious behaviour justifies an order of dismissal. Tonner v Lowry, 2016 FC 230 at paras.17-20; Hunt v Canada, 2017 FC 251 at para 33.\n[32] An abuse of process involves proceedings that are unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice and amount to oppressive treatment. The Tribunal has the authority to invoke the doctrine of abuse of process to dismiss a complaint where the proceedings are oppressive or vexatious and violate the fundamental principles of justice underlying the community\u2019s sense of fair play and decency. Unsupported allegations of improper conduct constitute an abuse of process. Repeated unsubstantiated allegations by a Complainant against a Tribunal Member may amount to an abuse of process leading to dismissal of the complaint where it appears the abuse will continue throughout the proceedings and no other remedy is capable of removing the prejudice caused by it. Cecilia Constantinescu v. Service Correctionnel Canada, 2022 CHRT at paras. 14-27.\nIV. RESPONSDENT\u2019S SUBMISSIONS [33] The Respondent submits that Ms. Holmen\u2019s conduct throughout the entirety of the inquiry of her complaint is vexatious and supports a finding of an abuse of process. In her communications to the Tribunal, the parties and others she has continually made rude, insulting, threatening and unsubstantiated statements against the Tribunal Member, members of the Tribunal staff, the parties and others alleging collusion, corruption, bias, criminality, bribery, obstructing justice and kidnapping of her children.\n[34] The Respondent argues that this conduct meets the criteria outlined by the Federal Court of a vexatious litigant and has caused damage to the administration of justice. Neither the Tribunal nor the Respondent are required to tolerate insults, unsubstantiated allegations of wrongdoings or threats as part of the Tribunal process. It is wholly unreasonable to expect the Complaint to proceed in such circumstances.\n[35] The Respondent submits that Ms. Holmen\u2019s conduct is not only offensive but it also lacks diligence as she has failed to revise her SOP as directed and has refused to further participate in the proceedings. Given the relentless accusations, threats and insults it is evident that this vexatious conduct will be manifested, perpetuated and aggravated throughout the conduct of the Tribunal process if allowed to continue.\n[36] The Respondent also argues that as the inquiry referred to the Tribunal by the Commission relates to events that took place between 2014 and 2017, the point is now being reached where witnesses will need to recall details of events of nearly a decade ago and this delay and further delays continue to prejudice the Respondent.\n[37] As such, the Respondent submits that no other remedy other than dismissal of the Complaint is reasonably capable of removing the prejudice that Ms. Holmen has caused. As she has refused to continue with the process, disrespected the Tribunal, the parties and the Rules the Complaint should be dismissed in order for the Tribunal to use its resources on other more deserving complaints.\nV. ANALYSIS [38] I agree with and accept all of the Respondent\u2019s submissions.\n[39] Ms. Holmen\u2019s behaviour in this case is both sad and disturbing. It is difficult to comprehend what would cause a person to behave in the manner that she has, particularly given the genuine support that was offered to her by the Tribunal and the Commission to assist with her SOP.\n[40] While the Tribunal must be cautious in allowing a motion to dismiss a complaint that has been referred to the Tribunal for an inquiry at a point where the pleadings have not yet been fully initiated, the facts of this case overwhelmingly require that action be taken to preserve the integrity of the process and avoid any further waste of time on a case that appears to have been abandoned by the Complainant. Tribunal resources are already scarce and should not be taken up by undeserving cases like this one while other deserving cases need to be attended to without delay.\n[41] Not only are Ms. Holmen\u2019s comments towards many of the people involved with this case insulting, profane, rude and threatening but her allegations, including kidnapping her children are absurd. None of us deserve to be treated the way Ms. Holmen has treated us and this conduct will not be tolerated any longer.\n[42] Moreover, Ms. Holmen\u2019s failure to amend her SOP as directed, to attend a CMCC as required or even to respond to this motion are totally disrespectful towards the Tribunal, the parties and the process and signify her abandonment of the Complaint. This is a clear case of vexatious behaviour that is an abuse of the process under the Rules that needs to be stopped immediately or else it will continue to waste everyone\u2019s time. There is no reasonable alternative other than dismissal of the Complaint in this case.\nVI. ORDER [43] For the foregoing reasons the motion is allowed and the Complaint is dismissed.\nSigned by\nEdward P.

A virtual hearing is planned. There are already many privacy measures in place because of the sensitive nature of the parties and the complaint. Before the hearing started, CSIS asked the Tribunal to say that current or former CSIS employees could give evidence with their cameras turned off or by using the \u201caudio only\u201d feature of Zoom.\nThe Tribunal refused to order that. Instead, the Tribunal said that the witnesses in question will not be identified by name and can turn off their cameras during opening and closing arguments. However, the Tribunal said that these witnesses will testify with their cameras on and that the public will not be allowed to attend that portion of the hearing. The Tribunal will place a recording of the audio on the official record. This allows for needed privacy protections while also making sure the public can access important information.\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation: 2023 CHRT\n37\nDate:\nAugust 31, 2023\nFile No.:\nT2715\/9121\nBetween:\nA.B.\nComplainant\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nCanadian Security Intelligence Service\nRespondent\nRuling\nMember:\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTable of Contents\nI. OVERVIEW 1\nII. DECISION 1\nIII. ISSUE 1\nIV. ANALYSIS 1\nV. ORDER 6\nI. OVERVIEW [1] The hearing in this matter is scheduled to begin on September 5, 2023, by videoconference using the Zoom platform. The Respondent, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (\u201cCSIS\u201d), has requested an order that current or former CSIS employees be permitted to give evidence with their cameras turned off or by dialing in using the audio- only feature of Zoom.\nII. DECISION [2] For the following reasons, I deny CSIS\u2019s motion and order instead that the witnesses in question may testify in camera in the presence only of the Complainant (\u201cAB\u201d), CSIS instructing authorities, parties\u2019 counsel, the Tribunal registry officer, and me.\nIII. ISSUE [3] Should the Tribunal issue an order under s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d) permitting certain witnesses to testify by video with their cameras turned off?\nIV. ANALYSIS [4] On February 8, 2023, I issued a ruling (AB v. Canadian Security Intelligence Service, 2023 CHRT 5) on a motion from CSIS, anonymizing most aspects of this case, pursuant to s. 52 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d). Section 52 states that Tribunal inquiries are conducted in public, but the Tribunal may take measures and issue orders to ensure the confidentiality of an inquiry if there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security are disclosed.\n[5] I noted in my ruling that s. 18(1) of the Canadian Security Intelligence Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-23 (\u201cCSIS Act\u201d) states that no person shall knowingly disclose any information from which it could be inferred the identity of a CSIS employee or former employee who was, is, or is likely to become engaged in covert operational CSIS activities (\u201cConfidential CSIS Employee\u201d). I considered this provision in my analysis, together with the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s reasons in Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 41 (\u201cSierra Club\u201d) and Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25, and I concluded:\n1) That revealing the identities of these individuals would pose a serious risk to an important public interest;\n2) That an order anonymizing their identities is necessary, and reasonable alternative measures would not prevent the serious risk to this important public interest;\n3) That the benefit of issuing the order outweighed its negative effects.\n[6] Specifically, I ordered that the Complainant, who is a former Confidential CSIS Employee, would only be identified by the pseudonym \u201cAB.\u201d I also directed that CSIS could identify any Confidential CSIS Employee by random initials or other pseudonym, provided their position title was made clear. I also ordered all parties to respect the confidentiality of the information in question by referring to all Confidential CSIS Employees by the random initials or pseudonyms assigned to them.\n[7] CSIS did not make any special request about how these employees would testify. At two Case Management Conference Calls (\u201cCMCC\u201d) that were held in the months following the ruling, it was understood that the hearing would be held in person in Ottawa, though it was possible some witnesses would appear by video. All CSIS witnesses were to testify in person, under the understanding that they would be addressed by their pseudonyms, and no one would disclose their real names.\n[8] On July 19, 2023, CSIS\u2019s counsel sent a letter to the Tribunal stating that CSIS had \u201cadvised\u201d them that its witnesses, and the Complainant, should all appear virtually by video with their cameras turned off at all times. At a CMCC held a few days later, I stated that any request for additional confidentiality orders regarding the Tribunal\u2019s public hearing would need to be made formally by application, pursuant to s. 52 of the CHRA.\n[9] On August 23, 2023, CSIS filed its Notice of Motion making the request. It was accompanied by an affidavit from someone identified under the alias \u201cJames,\u201d who is a Deputy Chief within CSIS\u2019s Litigation and Disclosure Branch. James offered to disclose under seal their real name to the Tribunal, but I do not think that is necessary.\n[10] CSIS submits that the Complainant and her witnesses, as well as all but two of CSIS\u2019s witnesses are current or former Confidential CSIS Employees. In its submissions, CSIS reiterates many of the factors that I considered when I issued the earlier order that those employees\u2019 names be anonymized. The affidavit states that the personal safety of these employees and their families is endangered if their identities were disclosed.\n[11] But CSIS now suggests that more than just anonymization with pseudonyms is needed. It submits it is trite that a person\u2019s face and image are essential components of their identity. The disclosure of the face, name, or any identifying feature should not be permitted to anyone participating in the hearing.\n[12] CSIS submits that my original order is not enough to protect the public interest in not disclosing the employees\u2019 identity. Revealing their face would reveal their identity, as surely as disclosing their name. Facial recognition technology could potentially readily match a witness\u2019s face with databases that would allow identification. Furthermore, there is likely to be media coverage of this case.\n[13] CSIS points out that testifying by voice alone is permitted under Rule 33(2) of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure 2021, SOR\/2021-137, which provides that a hearing could be conducted in whole or in part by telephone conference call, akin to an audio-only Zoom call. The rules of procedure for Federal and Ontario Courts have similar provisions.\n[14] CSIS also referred to several decisions that support the proposition that measures should be taken to prevent the disclosure of CSIS officers\u2019 identity. However, none of those decisions seem to address the specific question of witnesses testifying without showing their faces to the decision-maker or other parties.\n[15] As I already said in my first ruling, there is a public interest in protecting Confidential CSIS Employees\u2019 identity, which addresses the first component of the Sierra Club test that I applied. But I find that the order CSIS now seeks does not satisfy the second component of the test. In this instance, there exists a reasonable alternative measure to the one that CSIS proposes that would prevent the serious risk to this important public interest, namely, holding an in camera hearing with an audio recording that remains in the public record.\n[16] This approach was suggested at a CMCC that I conducted on August 24, 2023, after CSIS\u2019s motion was filed but before the other parties had prepared their written submissions, I proposed an option that focussed on AB\u2019s testimony only. CSIS later confirmed that it found the proposal acceptable. The Complainant and the Commission also agreed with it in their later submissions on the motion.\n[17] The proposal was that AB\u2019s testimony be given in camera. That is, the only people who would have access to the hearing proceedings during her testimony would be the parties\u2019 lawyers, the Complainant, CSIS\u2019s instructing representatives, the registry officer, and me. The audio portion of the in camera proceedings would be digitally recorded as part of the official record. Everyone would refer to any CSIS employees subject to my prior order by their pseudonyms. No one\u2019s identity would be revealed in the recording. Thus, the public interest in protecting their identity would be preserved while at the same respecting the open court principle, since the hearing\u2019s recording would remain part of the Tribunal\u2019s official record, which can be accessed in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Policy on Access to Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) Official Records, available on the Tribunal\u2019s website.\n[18] Although CSIS does not object to adopting this approach for AB\u2019s evidence, it disagrees with the Complainant\u2019s and Commission\u2019s suggestion that it be extended to the other Confidential CSIS Employees. CSIS points out that the reason this approach would work for AB\u2019s testimony is because she already revealed her name to the Commission and the Tribunal in her complaint, before it was anonymized. This does not apply for the identities of the other employees, which have not been revealed to the Tribunal or the other lawyers.\n[19] I am not persuaded by this argument. Even if this approach is extended to the testimonies of the other employees, they would still not be revealing their names to me, the registry officer, or the lawyers who as members of a law society, are subject to rules of professional conduct. I note that in my first order, I contemplated the possibility that position descriptions provided by CSIS may be insufficient to identify who an employee is and their involvement in an issue. I therefore ordered that in such instances, a full name must be disclosed to the Complainant or the Commission, on the condition that the information would be kept in confidence and not be publicized. In adopting the present proposed approach, even less information would be revealed to them than under my prior order \u2013 not even the names would be shared, just the image of the person testifying. On this last point, it should also be noted that the Tribunal directs in all hearings held by videoconference that no one is permitted to record any of the proceedings.\n[20] As both the Complainant and the Commission indicate, there are compelling procedural fairness reasons for ensuring that decision-makers and parties be able to see witnesses as they testify. In particular, the Commission cited the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s majority reasons in R v N.S., 2012 SCC 72 (\u201cN.S.\u201d), which held that there is a strong connection between the ability to see the face of a witness and a fair trial. The Court added that allowing a witness to testify without their face visible may impede credibility assessment by triers of fact. While visual assessments of demeanour are not the only or even the most important factor in deciding credibility, changes in demeanour can be highly instructive. One must assess whether the proposed departure from the practice of seeing the witness would create a real and substantial risk to trial fairness.\n[21] I am mindful that N.S. was a criminal case dealing with sexual assault allegations. However, I think the Court\u2019s observations are helpful in the current human rights context as well, where serious discriminatory practices have been alleged.\n[22] The Complainant and the Commission also pointed out that when the Tribunal addressed the fairness of holding hearings by videoconference after the start of the Covid pandemic, it underscored the fact that the witness appears \u201clive\u201d before Tribunal member, who can \u201cobserve the witness\u2019s non-verbal behaviour,\u201d (Hugie v. T-Lane Transportation and Logistics, 2020 CHRT 12 at para. 28).\n[23] I agree that these are important considerations. The proposed approach takes them into account while at the same time ensuring that the open court principle is adhered to, balanced against the public interest in not revealing any Confidential CSIS Employee\u2019s identity.\n[24] This brings up a second issue arising from CSIS\u2019s motion. It seeks to extend the confidential treatment of testimonies to two CSIS employee witnesses who do not fall squarely within the definition set out in s. 18 of the CSIS Act. These are persons who are not or were not engaged in covert operational activities. I had spelled out, at paragraph 17 of my earlier order, that it did not extend beyond the specific group of employees who require protection under s. 18. Consequently, the Commission and the Complainant argue that these witnesses should testify in public, with their cameras on.\n[25] I observe, however, that to date, CSIS has seemingly been referring to these witnesses with pseudonyms in its list of witnesses. In fact, I do not know which of CSIS\u2019s anonymous witnesses are the two. The Commission and the Complainant to date have not objected to their inclusion in the anonymous list, despite the statement in my earlier order. If it has been acceptable to keep all CSIS\u2019s proposed witnesses anonymous until now, I see no reason to treat them any differently at this late stage.\n[26] Subject to the presentation of any new compelling information on this question, these two witnesses, whoever they may be, may testify in camera like the Complainant and the other Confidential CSIS Employees.\nV. ORDER [27] The Commission provided in its submissions a proposed order, which I adopt with some modifications. I order that:\n1) CSIS\u2019s motion is denied.\n2) Confidential CSIS Employees will not be identified by name during the hearing.\n3) Opening statements will be open to the public, in the normal course \u2013 although AB and any CSIS instructing authorities who are Confidential CSIS Employees will turn their cameras off.\n4) Current and former Confidential CSIS Employees (which includes AB and any CSIS Employee on CSIS\u2019s witness list whose name has been anonymized) will be sworn or affirmed and testify with their cameras on, during in camera proceedings attended only by the member, the registry officer, AB, CSIS instructing authorities, and counsel for all parties. Audio-only recordings of any such testimony will form part of the official record and will be accessible in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Policy on Access to Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (CHRT) Official Records.\n5) The Commission\u2019s expert witness will testify with her camera on, during open public proceedings.\n6) Closing arguments will be open to the public, in the normal course \u2013 although AB and any CSIS instructing authorities who are Confidential CSIS Employees will turn their cameras off.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nAugust 31, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T2715\/9121\nStyle of Cause:\nAB v.

The decision will be published in both official languages once the translation is finalized, as required by the Official Languages Act.\nSummary:\nThis case is about Earl Ka-Nowpasikow, who had problems with his house on a reserve.\nMr. Ka-Nowpasikow is a member of the Poundmaker Cree Nation (the \u201cNation\u201d) and lived in House 103 on the reserve since 2003. This house is in bad shape. It has issues like mould, water damage and even rodents living inside. This house belongs to the Nation.\nAt first, Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow lived in the house with his wife, but they separated in 2010. Since then, he has been living there alone. He repeatedly asked for help to fix his house and even to build a new one, but the Nation didn't give him much of a response.\nMr. Ka-Nowpasikow felt like the Nation discriminated against him because he is part of the Tootoosis family, which doesn't support the current Chief. However, some members of the Tootoosis family got new housing, so membership in that family wasn\u2019t a reason for Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow\u2019s housing problems.\nMr. Ka-Nowpasikow also felt like the Nation discriminated against him because of his health problems and his status as a single man. His health issues included problems with his lungs and back that make it hard for him to work or move around.\nThe Nation argued that it doesn\u2019t have much money for housing and mainly uses its housing budget for emergencies. The housing budget has not increased since 1996 despite inflation and population growth. The budget is only $296,970. Because of this limited budget, the Nation prioritizes housing for single women, children and elders. The Nation said that it's okay to ask Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow to fix his house himself because he's a single man.\nHowever, the Tribunal didn't agree with the Nation. Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow\u2019s house was in such bad condition that it was making his lung problems worse. Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow could not fix the house himself because of his health conditions. As such, the Nation discriminated against Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow because he was a single man with a disability.\nAs a result, the Tribunal ordered the Nation to pay Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow $10,000 for the pain and suffering he has experienced and $5,000 because the Nation didn't properly consider his situation when he asked for help with his housing. The Tribunal also told both parties to work together to find a way to improve Mr. Ka-Nowpasikow\u2019s housing situation.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

The first complaint alleges that the Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) discriminates against all federally sentenced women through:\n\u2022 its security classification and risk assessment tools;\n\u2022 the use of segregation and isolated and restrictive conditions of confinement; and\n\u2022 its mental health services and programming.\nThe second complaint alleges that the CSC discriminates against all Indigenous, federally sentenced women when it denies them access to Indigenous spiritual, cultural and social practices.\nIn 2019, the CSC implemented a new way of managing inmates who cannot remain within the mainstream prison population, replacing \u201cadministrative segregation\u201d with \u201cStructured Intervention Units\u201d (SIUs). The CAEFS and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) say that, with SIUs, the CSC continues to discriminate (see 2022 CHRT 12, allowing amendments to the parties\u2019 Statements of Particulars).\nNow, the Commission wants the CSC to disclose documents related to SIUs as well as updates of other policy documents. The Commission said it needs these documents to evaluate the conditions for federally sentenced women since 2019.

The Tribunal expressed deep concern about the impact of the Commission\u2019s request on the progress of the inquiry. The Tribunal also noted that the documents contain highly personal and sensitive information about individuals who are not participating in this inquiry. No individual complainant has chosen to participate.\nThe Tribunal decided to review a sample of documents. The Tribunal directed the CSC to discuss with the CAEFS and the Commission which documents the CSC will include in the sample. The Tribunal also directed the parties to work together on a proposal about any further disclosure. The proposal must include suggested measures for how to safeguard the privacy, security and safety interests of the federally sentenced women who are involved. The Tribunal will review the sample of files and the proposal and then organize a case management conference call to discuss next steps.\nThe Tribunal ordered the CSC to disclose:\n\u2022 aggregated, statistical data about SIUs at women\u2019s institutions;\n\u2022 ten unredacted decisions made by Independent External Decision Makers about SIUs;\n\u2022 ten unredacted records of certain measures taken with respect to individuals (see subsections 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) and 37.3(4) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, SC 1992, c 20); and,\n\u2022 the current policies and procedures that the CSC intends to rely on in this inquiry.\nTo protect the women whose files are involved, the Tribunal ordered that any documents disclosed must be used only for the purpose of disclosure and must be kept confidential until further direction from the Tribunal. Any party may bring a motion for confidentiality before or, at the latest, as part of the parties\u2019 proposal about further disclosure.\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation: 2023 CHRT 39\nDate:\nSeptember 7, 2023\nFile Nos. :\nT1848\/7812; T1849\/7912\nBetween:\nCANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF ELIZABETH FRY SOCIETIES\nComplainant\n- and -\nCANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION\nCommission\n- and -\nCORRECTIONAL SERVICES OF CANADA\nRespondent\n- and \u2013\nNATIVE WOMEN\u2019S ASSOCIATION OF CANADA\nInterested Party\nRuling\nMember:\nJennifer Khurana\nI. OVERVIEW [1] The Complainant, the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies (CAEFS), filed two complaints on behalf of all federally sentenced women (FSW) alleging that Correctional Service of Canada (CSC), the Respondent, discriminates in providing correctional services in the federal prison system based on sex, race, national or ethnic origin, religion or disability, contrary to section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d). These complaints are not brought on behalf of any individual women, nor do they seek remedies for specific incidents of alleged discrimination.\n[2] The first complaint alleges discrimination in relation to security classification and risk assessment tools, the use of segregation and isolated and restrictive conditions of confinement, mental health services and appropriate accommodation, and access to programming. The second complaint was filed on behalf of federally sentenced Indigenous women (FSIW) and alleges that CSC denies them access to Indigenous spiritual, cultural and social practices, with reference to the particular experiences of overclassified and isolated Indigenous women.\n[3] Administrative segregation was abolished in 2019 as part of legislative changes to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act (CCRA). The federal government introduced Structured Intervention Units (SIUs) as an alternative way of managing inmates who cannot remain within the mainstream prison population. After these changes were made, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) and the CAEFS sought to amend their Statements of Particulars (SOPs) to include allegations that SIUs perpetuate the discrimination caused by administrative segregation, and in particular for FSIW and FWS with mental health disabilities. I allowed the Commission and the CAEFS to file amended SOPs in Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies v Correctional Services of Canada, 2022 CHRT 12 (\u201cthe SIU ruling\u201d), finding that the proposed amendments were sufficiently connected to the initial complaints, which included allegations about the ongoing discriminatory impact of segregation on women inmates.\n[4] The Commission filed a motion asking the Tribunal to order CSC to produce documents related to SIUs as well as updates of other policy documents. The Commission intends to call an expert, Dr. Kelly Hannah-Moffat, to testify about SIUs, among other things. It says that Dr. Hannah-Moffatt needs the materials to evaluate the conditions of detention since SIUs were implemented.\n[5] CSC wants the Tribunal to dismiss the motion and says that the requests are unnecessary and unreasonably broad. It also submits that disclosing individual institutional records of the FSW who have been transferred to a SIU raises a number of privacy and security concerns given the highly personal and sensitive content of the requested materials. CSC proposes producing a reasonable and discrete number of individual files of the FSW who consent to the disclosure of their personal information. It argues that limiting disclosure will help make exceptionally broad proceedings more manageable, particularly given that over 67,000 documents have already been produced in these complaints.\n[6] The CAEFS agrees with the Commission and says that CSC is trying to improperly narrow the scope of the complaints through the disclosure process.\n[7] I have set out my orders below regarding the next steps in this file. I am also strongly encouraging the parties to consider engaging in settlement discussions either on their own or through a Tribunal-assisted mediation or mediation-adjudication.\nII. ISSUE [8] Should the Tribunal order the production of the documents that the Commission requests in the form it seeks in its motion and reply?\nIII. DECISION [9] Yes, but only in part. I will review the aggregate data produced and a subset of the records requested before issuing any further direction on how to proceed.\n[10] I am not persuaded that the production of detailed individual institutional files of every federally sentenced woman who has been transferred to a SIU is necessary for the CAEFS and the Commission to make their cases fairly. Allowing the Commission\u2019s requests in their entirety will impact the timely and effective adjudication of this inquiry. Further, I have concerns about the privacy and security of the women at the heart of these complaints. They did not choose to be part of these proceedings, and, in ordering the production of their individual files as requested by the Commission, deeply personal information would be disclosed to a number of individuals.\n[11] CSC will produce the aggregate data it proposed to release as well as a limited number of individual files from FSW, as set out below. The parties will work together and agree on a sample of files for CSC to provide to counsel and the Tribunal. These files are not to be disclosed to any potential witnesses, or anyone else, including the interested party, until further order from the Tribunal.\n[12] After I review the records, I will convene the parties to a case management conference call (CMCC), prior to which they will be required to file a joint proposal regarding any further disclosure of individual files beyond the sample. The parties will include their proposal for the safeguarding of the privacy, security and safety interests of the FSW at issue in these complaints. I will review the materials and the parties\u2019 proposal before determining whether further production is to be ordered and, if so, in what form.\n[13] I am also strongly suggesting the parties reconsider the possibility of mediation or mediation-adjudication as an alternative to what will undoubtedly amount to lengthy and costly litigation in a multi-year proceeding. Collaborative efforts to resolve some or all of the issues in these complaints would allow the parties to work together far more quickly. It will also allow them to consider a range of creative options in complaints that seek broad, systemic change and policy reform. The parties may identify creative solutions that go beyond what the Tribunal may even be able to order if the CAEFS were successful in establishing discrimination.\nIV. THE COMMISSION\u2019S REQUESTS [14] The Commission filed a motion for production requesting several categories of documents. After reviewing CSC\u2019s response, I convened a CMCC because it appeared CSC did not dispute the production of some of the requested materials. I also asked the Commission and the CAEFS to specifically address CSC\u2019s arguments about privacy, confidentiality, security, proportionality and delay in their replies.\n[15] I directed the parties to create a summary table of the Commission\u2019s outstanding requests, including the reasons why CSC opposed their production and replies from the CAEFS and the Commission. I asked them to include the total time and resources CSC estimated would be required to produce the requested documents.\n[16] Together with its reply submissions, the Commission included an affidavit from its proposed expert witness and a new Annex A setting out the Commission\u2019s alternate requested relief. The reply prompted CSC to request the right to file a brief sur-reply because of the affidavit and new relief sought and the Commission to file a sur-sur-reply.\n[17] I will not address every argument raised by the parties in their motion materials. I have only dealt with what is necessary to set out a path forward at this stage of the proceedings.\nA. The Commission\u2019s requests\n[18] It appears there are four remaining categories of documents for which the Commission is seeking a Tribunal order:\nAll data and records shared by CSC with the Implementation Advisory Panel (IAP) concerning women\u2019s institutions and all information requests made of CSC by the IAP;\nDecisions made by the Independent External Decision Makers (IEDMs) regarding SIUs at women\u2019s institutions since November 30, 2019;\nReports created under paragraphs 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) and 37.3(4) of the CCRA concerning women\u2019s institutions; and\nMaterial documents on which CSC intends to rely in its SOPs and at the hearing, focusing on current policies and procedures.\n[19] The Commission sought alternative relief through an annex it added to its reply. It wants CSC to produce individual offender information for every woman transferred to a SIU in a women\u2019s institution, including details of the offender\u2019s mental health, any and all incidents of suicidality, and details of the offender\u2019s personal interactions while in the SIU. According to the Commission, this list is based largely on the information it says that its expert needs to prepare her report. The Commission included an affidavit from Dr. Hannah-Moffatt in support of its request.\nV. ANALYSIS [20] Parties must be given a full and ample opportunity to present their case (s. 50(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)). This includes the right to the disclosure of all arguably relevant information held by the opposing party so that each party knows the evidence it is up against and can prepare for the hearing (Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2019 CHRT 8 at para. 4). The Tribunal\u2019s Rules require parties to disclose a copy of all documents in their possession that relate to a fact, issue or form of relief that is sought in the case, including those identified by other parties (Rule 23 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure). This obligation is ongoing (SM et al v Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2022 CHRT 11 and Rule 24 of the Tribunal\u2019s Rules of Procedure).\n[21] The threshold for disclosure is arguable or possible relevance, which is not particularly high. A party seeking the production of a document must show that there is a rational connection between the document it seeks and the issues raised in the complaint. See, for example, T.P. v. Canadian Armed Forces, 2019 CHRT 19 at para. 11 (\u201cT.P.\u201d) Turner v. CBSA, 2018 CHRT 1 at para. 30 (\u201cTurner\u201d). Requests for disclosure should not be speculative or amount to a fishing expedition (Egan v. Canada Revenue Agency, 2017 CHRT 33 at paras. 31-32 (\u201cEgan\u201d) and Turner at para. 30).\n[22] Beyond arguable relevance, the Tribunal must also consider other possible interests such as confidentiality and privilege. Documents that are arguably relevant may not be ordered disclosed, or conditions may be placed on their disclosure if there are privilege or privacy concerns to be addressed. The Tribunal can take measures to protect privacy interests in different ways by limiting disclosure or putting conditions on the disclosure. (See White v. Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, 2020 CHRT 5 at paras 9-10; T.P. at para. 37, Egan at paras. 34 and 50 and Yaffa v. Air Canada, 2014 CHRT 22 at para 12).\n[23] While arguable relevance is not a high threshold, it is meant to prevent production for purposes which are speculative, fanciful, disruptive, unmeritorious and time consuming (Brickner v Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28 at para 5).\nA. Arguable relevance [24] I accept that the documents requested are arguably relevant to the allegations that the use of isolation and restrictive conditions of confinement have particular adverse impacts on FSIW and FSW with mental health disabilities. The threshold for arguable relevance is low, and the complaints are broad. I have already found that allegations of systemic discrimination related to isolated and restrictive conditions of confinement have been part of these proceedings since their outset (SIU Ruling at paras 17-30). It is not difficult to find a rational connection between the documents sought about SIUs and the complaints. They are systemic, cover multiple grounds and include four broad categories of allegations that relate to many aspects of the carceral conditions of all FSW in Canada, including the use of isolated and restrictive conditions of confinement.\n[25] But arguable relevance is not the only factor for me to consider. The hearing process must be fair, balanced and proportionate. I also have concerns about the privacy and safety interests of the FSW whose records would be disclosed and who are not parties to these proceedings.\nB. Proportionality [26] CSC submits that the CAEFS and the Commission are treating this inquiry as complaints of 89 different persons, without identifying any particular federal offender complainant or victim. It says that the veil of a \u201csystemic complaint\u201d cannot be used to expand document production to what amounts to a fishing expedition for evidence about every federal offender in any women\u2019s institution, anywhere in Canada, at any point in time since 2011 or earlier. It submits that the time and resources required to produce these documents are disproportionate to their potential value and will bog down these already delayed proceedings.\n[27] The Commission says that its requests do not amount to a fishing expedition because there is already publicly available information that suggests Indigenous women are disproportionately represented in isolation under the SIU regime. It says that the SIU data will show the results of the system and will prove how this subset of FSW are adversely impacted by SIUs.\n[28] CSC takes the position that some documents are minimally or not arguably relevant and that proportionality requires all actors in the justice system to conduct themselves to reduce the time and costs associated with legal proceedings as much as possible. This can warrant imposing limits within a proceeding (Temate v. Public Health Agency of Canada, 2022 CHRT 31 at paras 8-16). It submits that the Commission is effectively seeking individual institutional file documents for each of the 89 (or more) federal offenders who have been transferred to a SIU in a women\u2019s institution in at least 149 different transfers since the SIU regime began in 2019.\n[29] According to CSC, the parties\u2019 shared goal should be a fair, workable and timely hearing, to the extent possible. I agree. The Commission and the CAEFS have not persuaded me that their approach strikes the appropriate balance between their right to make their case and the need for efficient and fair proceedings at this time. I have other concerns about the privacy, safety and security interests of FSW set out below.\n[30] The Commission submits that its requests are specific, proportionate and that the number of women in SIU placements is low. It argues that the public interest and the inquiry requires CSC to dedicate the resources required to disclose the data.\n[31] According to the CAEFS, it would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to allow CSC to transform systemic inquiries into a few cases of individualized discrimination by limiting its production of arguably relevant documents. It relies on Desmarais v. Correctional Service of Canada, 2014 CHRT 5 [Desmarais] in which the Tribunal found it needed to consider evidence of systemic discrimination against intellectually disabled inmates. The CAEFS also submits that it would be a legal error for the Tribunal to decline to consider systemic evidence, relying on the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 1998 CanLii 7740 at paras 17-22.\n[32] Desmarais does not assist. In Desmarais, CSC sought to strike the systemic discrimination aspects of the inquiry and also wanted the disclosure of evidence related to the allegations of systemic discrimination to be limited to those documents which defined the existing situation while the complainant was imprisoned under the supervision of CSC. In this case, CSC consents to producing aggregate data and a subset of the files, just not the entirety of individual institutional files for every FSW at issue in these complaints.\n[33] Further, I am not declining to order production or refusing to consider systemic evidence. I agree that systemic evidence includes operation-wide practices, policies, statistics and data which may demonstrate patterns of conduct, as reflected in my orders below. I am, however, considering how to contain what will become an entirely unmanageable proceeding, without any limits and case management direction.\n[34] I accept the Commission and the CAEFS\u2019 submissions that there is a basis for these requests. I also accept the CAEFS\u2019 submission that the Tribunal\u2019s job is to conduct an inquiry into complaints the Commission refers to it (s.49(1) and 49(2) of the Act), including systemic allegations, and that it can make orders to prevent discrimination if a complaint is substantiated. The Tribunal does not have the authority to control the nature or volume of complaints that the Commission refers to it for an inquiry. But I do not accept that limiting disclosure is inappropriate simply because these are systemic complaints with no individual complainant.\n[35] Parliament chose to delegate decision-making in specialized areas such as human rights to administrative tribunals and expects them to proceed expeditiously and efficiently (Dorey et al, 2023 CHRT 23 at paras 28, 32, citing Law Society of Saskatchewan v. Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29 at paras 46 and 64). Conducting proceedings as informally and expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow is not only appropriate, but also an obligation under s. 48.9(1) of the Act. Further, imposing reasonable limits to disclosure to ensure the Tribunal process is manageable and providing case management direction is the job of an adjudicator. \u201cSystemic\u201d does not mean that there is no limit to how this proceeding will be run. It also does not transform an adversarial process in the context of litigation into a Royal Commission.\n[36] Further, it is not in the public interest, nor in the interest of the FSW on whose behalf these complaints are brought, to ignore that this Tribunal is neither mandated nor has the resources to run a limitless proceeding, whether in disclosure or later on in the process. Doing so would paralyze the Tribunal and extinguish its already scarce resources. This will not only impact these proceedings but will also affect other parties waiting to have their cases heard and decided. This is not in the public interest, nor does it advance the purposes of the Act I am bound to apply. Joint positions, collaboration, and effective case management are necessary for the proper functioning and stability of the administration of justice, including at this Tribunal. All parties will have to make choices in the context of this litigation, and I will direct them to do so over the course of these proceedings. For example, the parties were expected to make remaining disclosure requests in a proportionate way (SIU Ruling at para 10).\n[37] I acknowledge the importance of pre-hearing disclosure where all the materials are held by one party. In this proceeding, CSC has the care and control of all documentation pertaining to FSW. I also acknowledge that pre-hearing disclosure must be proportionate to the nature and complexity of the proceedings. The issues underlying these complaints have significant public interest implications and involve a number of allegations about the carceral conditions of FSW. But failing to properly manage these proceedings will not assist in their effective adjudication or resolution.\n[38] I must also balance the probative value of the records sought in relation to the time, cost and other interests involved in their production, including those of the FSW. I have set out some parameters and provided direction below in my findings on each of the specific categories of materials sought by the Commission.\nC. Privacy and security concerns [39] CSC submits that the individual institutional records should not be disclosed for safety and security reasons, without at a minimum notifying the offenders or getting their consent to disclose highly personal information. CSC included a sworn affidavit from Marie-France Lapierre, the Director in CSC\u2019s Women Offender Sector, together with its motion response. Ms. Lapierre notes that the production of the records could raise security risks if offenders are identifiable, particularly given the small number of FSW in Canada, the even smaller number of individuals who have been transferred to SIUs and the breadth of personal information contained in SIU records. She says that redacting the data and documents in order to mitigate the risk of offenders being identifiable would require a very high degree of expertise. In addition, CSC says that the SIU-related documents contain so much personal information about FSW and others, including family members, that redaction would render their contents meaningless.\n[40] The Commission and the CAEFS argue that there is no requirement to obtain the consent of the 89 FSW at issue. They say the exemptions set out in sections 8(2)(c) and (d) of the Privacy Act apply because the requested documents relate to CSC\u2019s disclosure obligations under the Tribunal\u2019s Rules and because CSC is a litigant represented by the Attorney General of Canada. Further, the Commission says that if CSC thought that the consent of the FSW was required, it should have started trying to obtain that consent from the individual women.\n[41] The CAEFS also submits that CSC\u2019s proposal to obtain consent is practically unworkable because it does not have knowledge of or access to FSW in SIUs and that it depends on CSC to disclose the existence of and allow access to women held in SIUs. Finally, it says that fear of reprisal is a barrier to FSW participating in legal proceedings, and particularly for women who have been held in SIUs. It says that the privacy interests of FSW can be resolved through redactions and should not be used as a basis to deny production of arguably relevant information to the other parties.\n[42] The Commission says that it will forego the names of women and other irrelevant personal identifiers and accept the information without extensive redactions to speed up the disclosure process. It will undertake to protect the information and will only use the disclosure for the purpose of this case in accordance with the implied undertaking rule. Although CSC set out a list of information it considers personal that should not be disclosed, the Commission objects to CSC withholding that information because it says that it needs this to make its case.\n[43] While I accept the CAEFS\u2019 submissions about the challenge to obtain FSW\u2019s consent to access their records, I am not prepared to order the production of such an extensive number of documents without carefully considering the privacy, safety and security needs of FSW. I acknowledge the Privacy Act provisions that the Commission and the CAEFS rely on. But I must be concerned with safeguarding the safety, privacy and security of the FSW who have had no say in this litigation. They may have had no notice that details of their personal and health histories, including attempts at suicide and other deeply personal stories about them\u2014and even their families\u2014may be disclosed to an expert, to the other parties and to the Tribunal. Both the CAEFS and the Commission have commented on the vulnerability of FSW.\n[44] Given the nature of the information sought, including details about FSW\u2019s potential suicide risks and their psychological and medical history, I do not accept the Commission\u2019s submission that some of these concerns are speculative. These are not the musings of counsel. CSC included the sworn statement of Ms. Lapierre who works with FSW at CSC and whose experience provides a basis for these concerns which I am not prepared to disregard.\n[45] While we are only at the pre-hearing disclosure stage, and I may order confidentiality measures as this inquiry moves forward, in my view, I must consider how to carefully balance the needs of the FSW at issue in these proceedings in a trauma-informed way before any of these records are more broadly disclosed. I will first review a sample of some of the documents and hear from the parties before deciding how to proceed. I will not order such broad disclosure of individual institutional files without an assurance that doing so will not cause further harm to individuals who did not pursue this litigation themselves and whose lives are controlled by others.\n[46] One of the complaints is brought on behalf of FSIW. The Interested Party, the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada, may also be able to offer some perspective and expertise on how best to address the safety, security and privacy concerns of some of the FSIW at issue in the disclosure request.\n1) All data and records shared by CSC with the Implementation Advisory Panel (IAP) concerning women\u2019s institutions and all information requests made of CSC by the IAP [47] CSC says that the data it provided to the IAP is neither current nor specific to women\u2019s institutions. Further, what it provided to the IAP is raw data which may be difficult to understand and interpret without an in-depth knowledge of CSC\u2019s operations and data collection and reporting practices. It also has privacy and confidentiality concerns and says that it would very likely take longer than 6 months, and perhaps significantly longer than that, to extract and properly redact the data shared with the IAP. In the alternative, CSC has offered to provide up-to-date data specific to women\u2019s institutions. It proposes providing information about the name of the institution, a unique identifier, whether the offender is Indigenous or not and the reason for the SIU transfer as well as the length of the stay in the SIU.\n[48] The Commission says it needs statistical data to show patterns of discrimination if they exist. It did not, however, accept CSC\u2019s proposal and says that its expert needs more data. It listed a number of elements in Annex A to its reply submissions that it is seeking for every FSW who has been transferred to a SIU. These include the individual\u2019s mental health needs, instances of self-injury or suicidality prior to their transfer to a SIU, the individual\u2019s security level, the amount of meaningful human contact provided by day, the period of time out of the cell each day and the information on how the time out of the cell was spent. It says Dr. Hannah-Moffat needs details of personal characteristics to prepare an intersectional analysis of the results, namely whether FSIW and FSW with mental health disabilities are experiencing longer stays in SIUs.\n[49] According to CSC, the Commission\u2019s Annex and requests for individual offender information exceed what its own proposed expert says she needs. If what the Commission needs is data to show the results of the system and to show patterns of discrimination, it argues this detailed individual information is not required.\n[50] The Commission\u2019s request, including its alternative \u201ccustomized response\" is denied. CSC has already confirmed that the IAP did not make any information requests of CSC specifically concerning women\u2019s institutions and that what it provided to the IAP were raw data sheets. It is not required to create documents that do not exist. CSC\u2019s proposed alternative is reasonable and allows the Commission and the CAEFS to receive up-to-date aggregate data specific to women\u2019s institutions. That aggregate data includes, among other things, the number of offenders at each security classification when transferred to a SIU, the number who are Indigenous, the length of stays in SIUs and the number of times transferred to a SIU.\n[51] It is not clear from the submissions what individual elements Dr. Hannah-Moffat needs if CSC provides the aggregate data, nor to what extent highly personal individualised information for all FSW in SIUs is relevant and required.\n[52] I will review the data set out in Appendix 1 of CSC\u2019s sur-reply and address this with the parties at a CMCC after hearing their joint proposals for moving forward.\n2) Decisions made by the IEDMs regarding SIUs at women\u2019s institutions since November 30, 2019\n[53] Under the CCRA, IEDMs have binding authority to decide whether a prisoner remains in a SIU. They can also order changes to conditions of confinement. The Commission says that it needs these decisions because they are highly relevant to how the SIU regime functions and the allegations of discrimination.\n[54] In her affidavit, Ms. Lapierre explains that IEDM decisions are individualised, detailed decisions about offenders\u2019 specific circumstances that contain personal information such as whether the individual identifies as Indigenous, their social history, past and current illnesses and health concerns, prior sentences, details of their home community, security classification, correctional plan, \u201cincompatible\u201d offenders, affiliation with security threat groups, the circumstances that led to their transfer to SIU, and the interactions they had while in the SIU. These decisions also contain the personal information of individuals other than the offenders, including family members, other offenders and the IEDM decision-maker. According to CSC, approximately 70 IEDM decisions have been made since 2019.\n[55] CSC will produce ten unredacted IEDM decisions to the Commission and the CAEFS and to the Tribunal no later than October 20, 2023. The parties will work together to determine how to select and identify the files that CSC will provide. Failure to arrive at an agreement for how to proceed and to select the files in a timely way means that the matter will be further delayed due to the parties\u2019 inability to agree on a reasonable approach. These files must not be disclosed to any potential witnesses, or anyone else, until further order from the Tribunal.\n[56] Following my review of the files, I will address a way forward with the parties after hearing from the parties, including from the Commission about the specific data elements its expert realistically needs.\n3) Reports created under paragraphs 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) and 37.3(4) of the CCRA concerning women\u2019s institutions [57] The CCRA and related Commissioner\u2019s Directives require CSC to report on the following:\na)Every instance of meaningful human contact with a prisoner in SIUs that is mediated or interposed by physical barriers such as bars, security glass, door hatches or screen (s.32(3);\nb)Every instance in which a prisoner is authorized to be transferred to a SIU with the reasons for granting the authorization and any alternative that was considered (s.34(2));\nc)Every instance in which a prisoner has been offered an opportunity to spend a minimum of four hours outside their cell or interact, for a minimum of two hours, with others that the prisoner refused, including the specific opportunity and any reason given for the reason, or why they have not been given such an opportunity (s.37(2));\nd)Every instance of circumstances in which, because of security requirements, a visit was not face to face or took place through a cell door hatch (s.37.3(4));\n[58] The Commission says it requires these reports because they will show what the conditions of confinement are in SIUs and whether prisoners are receiving the meaningful human contact required by the legislation.\n[59] CSC says that there have been at minimum 149 transfers to SIUs in women\u2019s institutions and that it will take a month of full-time dedicated work to extract these records, plus additional time to review the records. They also argue that the records contain personal information that will need to be redacted and that there are similar concerns regarding privacy, safety and security as with the IEDM decisions.\n[60] CSC will produce a sample of ten unredacted records to the Commission and the CAEFS and to the Tribunal no later than October 20, 2023, after having conferred with the Commission and the CAEFS to identify which files are to be provided.\n[61] As set out above with respect to the Commission\u2019s second request, the Tribunal will determine what further orders to make, if any, following its review of the record, a proposal from the parties and a CMCC.\n4) Material documents on which CSC intends to rely in its Statement of Particulars and at the hearing, focusing on current policies and procedures [62] The Commission initially requested updated versions of documents already produced or agreed or ordered to be produced, on an ongoing basis. CSC said it was not feasible to do this as there have already been 67,000 documents disclosed in these proceedings. It proposed to focus on current policies and practices on which it intends to rely at the hearing.\n[63] The Commission agrees with CSC\u2019s proposal. CSC is ordered to produce those materials to the other parties no later than October 20, 2023.\nNo order required Photographs of SIUs in women\u2019s institutions and CSC\u2019s offer of site visits\n[64] There is no order for me to make. The Commission initially requested photographs of SIUs in women\u2019s institutions so that its expert could provide an opinion on the conditions of confinement. The records do not exist. CSC has offered to arrange a visit for the Commission\u2019s expert to tour a women\u2019s institution and its SIU, subject to reasonable safeguards. The Commission can arrange a visit for its expert directly with CSC.\nVI. Mediation and agreed statements of facts [65] Litigating broad systemic claims of discrimination in the provision of services, in this case on behalf of all FSW across Canada on multiple intersecting grounds, with no lead complainant(s) will be long, costly and involve extensive resources for everyone\u2014the parties and the Tribunal. Mediating some or all of the issues or working to identify a more collaborative path forward may lead to a more immediate result to the benefit of all concerned. There are many ways to try and settle the complaints, sometimes involving creative and unique solutions.\n[66] Some of the public interest remedies that the CAEFS and the Commission are seeking necessarily involve broad consultations and policy reform and would require operational or regulatory changes in how correctional services are delivered. While the Canadian Human Rights Act is broad, remedial legislation, the Tribunal is a creature of statute. There are limits to its jurisdiction and to what it can order. The Tribunal cannot remediate all injustices, nor is it an expert policy-making body, the legislature or Parliament. Further, using an adversarial system to litigate broad, systemic allegations and seek remedial requests that necessitate significant policy reform and consultation is not an easy fit. There may well be a more constructive way forward that will take less time and may be better aligned with the public interest issues raised by these complaints.\n[67] Under the Act, the Tribunal conducts inquiries into complaints the Commission refers to it. I nevertheless strongly encourage the parties to consider returning to mediation or mediation-adjudication as an alternative to litigation, particularly given the nature of these complaints. The CAEFS and the Commission have made submissions about the vulnerability of FSW, and particularly FSIW and FWS with mental health disabilities. Finding a collaborative path forward remains an option that may lead to some resolution of part of all of these complaints far more quickly and in a more holistic way. That would also be in the public interest.\n[68] Although the parties have engaged in mediation efforts in the past, they can revisit this option at any time. The Tribunal can appoint a separate mediator, or I can work with the parties in mediation-adjudication, at any time.\nVII. ORDER [69] By no later than October 20, 2023, CSC will produce the following:\n1)Aggregate statistical data about SIUs at women\u2019s institutions, as set out in Appendix 1 of CSC\u2019s sur-reply;\n2)Ten (10) unredacted IEDM decisions to counsel for the Commission and the CAEFS and to the Tribunal, as set out in paragraph [55] above;\n3)Ten (10) unredacted records related to reports created under paragraphs 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) and 37.3(4) of the CCRA to counsel for the Commission and the CAEFS and to the Tribunal, as set out in paragraph [60] above; and\n4)Current policies and procedures on which CSC intends to rely in its SOPs and at the hearing.\n[70] The Tribunal makes no order with respect to the Commission\u2019s request for photographs of SIUs in women\u2019s institutions.\n[71] Following receipt and review of these materials, the Tribunal will provide further direction to the parties in advance of a CMCC.\n[72] Any documents produced to the other parties or to the Tribunal subject to this order must only be used for the purpose of disclosure and for no other purpose. Documents disclosed subject to paras 69(ii) and (iii) must be kept confidential on an interim basis, pending further direction from the Tribunal. The parties may make a request for confidentiality before, or at the latest, as part of the parties\u2019 proposal following the Tribunal\u2019s review of the documents ordered in this ruling. No information may be published or disclosed in the public domain without express order of this Tribunal or consent of the individual whose information is at issue.\nSigned by\nJennifer Khurana\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, ON\nSeptember 7, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nFile Nos. : T1848\/7812; T1849\/7912\nStyle of Cause: Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies v.

RULING\n[1] The Complainants Robert Kopeck and Kewal Sidhu have filed human rights complaints (\u201cCHRC Complaints\u201d) in which they allege age-related discrimination against their union, the Respondent International Longshore and Warehouse Union Local 500 (\u201cUnion\u201d).\n[2] The Union denies discriminating and has filed a preliminary motion to dismiss the CHRC Complaints on the basis that the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (\u201cCIRB\u201d) has adjudicated and dismissed similar complaints filed by the Complainants (\u201cCIRB Complaints\u201d). The Union says that the CHRC Complaints should be dismissed on the basis of issue estoppel, abuse of process, and a collateral attack on the CIRB ruling.\n[3] For reasons that follow, the Union\u2019s motion is denied.\nII. CONTEXT\n[4] At all material times, the Complainants were members in good standing with the Union and were employed on the Vancouver waterfront by various employers under the provisions of a collective agreement in force between the Union and the various employers represented by the BC Maritime Employers Association (\u201cBCMEA\u201d).\n[5] Pursuant to the terms of the collective agreement, workers in the Complainants\u2019 category of work (fork-lift operators) were assigned work to the employers at the waterfront on a daily basis. Work was generally allocated on the basis of a member\u2019s accrued seniority, with the more senior members being assigned work ahead of less senior members, and ahead of \u201ccasual\u201d workers who were not accorded membership status with the Union.\n[6] In about 2011, following the federal government\u2019s repeal of mandatory retirement at age 65 in the federal sector, the Union and BCMEA eliminated mandatory retirement in the industry. Members who had acquired the age of 65 and who elected to continue working were allowed to avail themselves of Waterfront Industry Pension Plan income and benefits (\u201cPension income\u201d) that they had accrued over the term of their employment and membership in the Union.\n[7] The Union says that many of its members objected to the fact that members could continue earning full wages after availing themselves of Pension income, a term that the Union referred to as \u201cdouble dipping\u201d.\n[8] In response to these objections, the Union instituted a rule in 2014 whereby if a member elected to receive Pension income, they would be given work allocation only after other members and casual workers were provided work allocation despite any accrued seniority (\u201cPensioner Dispatch Rule\u201d).\n[9] This policy impacted those workers over the age of 65 but under the age of 72 who elected to receive Pension income. However, as workers grew older, there came a point when the receipt of Pension income was no longer optional. Pursuant to regulations under the Income Tax Act RSC 1985, c 1 (5th Supp) (\u201cITA\u201d) receipt of Pension income was mandatory for those over the age of 71.\n[10] In 2017, the Union passed a rule whereby members were required to follow the Pensioner Dispatch Rule at the end of the year in which they were mandated to start collecting Pension income under the ITA if they had not already elected to do so earlier (\u201cPensioner Equalization Rule\u201d).\n[11] In January 2018, the Complainants filed their CIRB and CHRC Complaints. At the time, both Complainants were over the age of 71 and mandated to receive Pension income under the ITA. They both sought to continue working and say that other members and casual workers were assigned work before them despite their decades of accrued seniority due to the operation of the Union\u2019s Pensioner Dispatch Rule and Pensioner Equalization Rule. The Complainants alleged that the Union\u2019s actions discriminated against them on the basis of age and caused them to sustain income loss and other damages.\n[12] On January 23, 2019, CIRB dismissed the CIRB Complaints (2019 CIRB LD 4089; the \u201cCIRB Ruling\u201d). On October 12, 2021, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) referred the CHRC Complaints to the Tribunal to institute an inquiry.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the motion\n[13] The Complainants say that the Commission referred their complaints to the Tribunal notwithstanding the Union advancing an argument before the Commission that CIRB previously dismissed similar complaints on similar facts.\n[14] The Complainants say that, since the Union failed to seek a judicial review of the Commission\u2019s referral decision, the Union is deemed to have accepted the decision and the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss. They say that the Tribunal is statutorily obligated to hear their complaints once referred by the Commission pursuant to s. 49 and 50 of the CHRA.\n[15] I do not accept the Complainants\u2019 submissions in this regard.\n[16] The Tribunal is the master of its own process and has the power to dismiss a complaint on a preliminary basis, where warranted. As stated by the Federal Court:\n[137] After examining some of the statutory provisions referred to above, Justice von Fickenstein observed that it was \u201chard to fathom\u201d why it would be in anyone\u2019s interest for the Tribunal to hold a hearing in a case where the hearing would amount to an abuse of process: at para. 18. He concluded that there was no statutory or jurisprudential bar that would preclude the Tribunal from dismissing a complaint on the basis of a preliminary motion on the grounds of abuse of process, \u201calways assuming there are valid grounds to do so\u201d: at para 19. This decision was subsequently affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal: 2004 FCA 363 (CanLII), 329 N.R. 95.\n(Emphasis Added)\nCanada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2012 FC 445\n[17] The Commission\u2019s referral of a complaint to the Tribunal creates the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to conduct an inquiry into the complaint. Subsection 50(2) of the CHRA grants the Tribunal powers to make all findings of fact and law that are necessary to determine the matter. While there may have been a separate opportunity for the Union to challenge the Commission\u2019s referral decision, this does not preclude or otherwise fetter the Tribunal\u2019s power to determine preliminary matters in the course of its inquiry: Melissa Paton v. Spearing Service L.P. 2022 CHRT 37 at para. 13.\n[18] Further, the Commission\u2019s referral of a complaint for inquiry pursuant to s. 50(1) of the CHRA does not require the Tribunal to hold a hearing as submitted by the Complainants. The use of the term \u201cinquiry\u201d in s. 50(1) and the term \u201chearing\u201d in s. 50(3) of the CHRA indicates that the referral of a matter to the Tribunal does not necessarily mandate a hearing. As noted by the Federal Court:\nIf Parliament had intended that there be a \u201chearing\u201d every time that a complaint was referred to the Tribunal it would have used this term instead of the term \u201cinquiry\u201d which is employed in subsection 50(1) of the Act. The use of the term \u201cinquiry\u201d in subsection 50(1) and the term \u201chearing\u201d in subsection 50(3) clearly indicates that the referral of a matter to the Tribunal does not necessarily have to result in a hearing in every case.\nCanada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada Post Corp., 2004 FC 81 at para 17 (affirmed 2004 FCA 363)\n[19] Accordingly, I find that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss the CHRC Complaints notwithstanding the Commission\u2019s referral of these complaints to the Tribunal.\nB. The timing of the complaints is not relevant\n[20] The Union says the Complainants are \u201cforum shopping\u201d to seek a more favorable result in a different venue. The Complainants dispute this and say that the premise of the Union\u2019s motion to dismiss is erroneous because they filed the CHRC Complaints before the CIRB Complaints. Specifically, Mr. Kopeck and Mr. Sidhu filed their complaints with the Commission on January 6 and 8, 2018, respectively, and filed their joint complaints with CIRB on January 15, 2018.\n[21] The Complainants say that this demonstrates that the CHRC Complaints were the \u201cfirst priority\u201d of the Complainants given the human rights issues at stake, and not an attempt to forum shop. The Complainants say the CIRB Complaints were merely \u201csecondary\u201d and were filed simply because of the \u201cexpediency of the decisions made by CIRB\u2026 resulting in decisions being rendered in weeks, not years, as is the normal case with the CHRC and CHRC adjudication processes\u201d.\n[22] The Complainants elected to file complaints raising similar human rights issues with both the Commission and CIRB. Absent express statutory language to the contrary, tribunals (such as CIRB) have concurrent jurisdiction to apply human rights legislation: British Columbia (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) v. Figliola 2011 SCC 52 (\u201cFigliola\u201d) at para. 45.\n[23] In these circumstances, the fact that the Complainants filed the CHRC Complaints a few days prior to the CIRB Complaints, or their intent at the time of filing, are not relevant considerations. What is relevant is whether the issues raised in the CHRC Complaints constitute a collateral attack on the CIRB Ruling or otherwise bar the Complainants from proceeding on the basis of issue estoppel or abuse of process.\n[24] It is to these issues that I turn next.\nC. The complaints are not subject to issue estoppel\n[25] The common law doctrines of issue estoppel, abuse of process, and collateral attack hold that once an issue is decided by a competent court or tribunal, that issue should not be relitigated, except in an appeal or a judicial review proceeding. Underlying these doctrines are the \u201cprinciples of finality, the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings, and protection for the integrity of the administration of justice\u201d: Figliola at para. 25.\n[26] While these doctrines are interrelated, they are not identical concepts. Nevertheless, at the core of each doctrine are the principles of finality and fairness. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Figliola:\nAll of these questions go to determining whether the substance of a complaint has been \u201cappropriately dealt with\u201d. At the end of the day, it really is a question of whether it makes sense to expend public and private resources on the relitigation of what is essentially the same dispute. (para. 37)\n[27] The Union submits that the CHRC Complaints should be dismissed on the basis of issue estoppel.\n[28] The test for issue estoppel requires a two-step analysis. First, three pre-conditions must be met: the same question was previously decided; the earlier decision was final; and, the parties or their privies were the same. Second, if these pre-conditions are met, the Tribunal must determine, as a matter of discretion, whether issue estoppel ought to be applied in the interest of fairness considering a number of factors including the purpose of the legislative framework enacted for each proceeding, the availability of an appeal, the procedural safeguards available to the parties, the circumstances giving rise to the prior proceeding, and the potential injustice to the parties of applying estoppel: Figliola at para. 27 and 62.\n[29] In this case, although the CIRB Ruling (and prior related rulings) were final and the parties before CIRB were the same as the parties now before this Tribunal, I find that the scope of the issues before CIRB and this Tribunal are distinguishable.\n[30] In the CIRB Complaints, the Complainants allege that the Pensioner Dispatch Rule and Pensioner Equalization Rule violate s. 37 (the Union\u2019s duty of fair representation) and s. 69 (the Union\u2019s duty of fair referral) of the Canada Labour Code RSC 1985, c L-2 (\u201cCode\u201d).\n[31] In its ruling, CIRB determined that since the Union\u2019s rules were an internal policy and not part of the collective agreement, s.37 of the Code was not applicable. As a result, CIRB summarily dismissed this aspect of the complaints without conducting a discrimination analysis. As stated by CIRB:\n\u2026The principles applicable to the DFR [duty of fair representation] are well established. The Board has consistently held that the scope of the DFR under s. 37 of the Code relates to the exercise of a right held by the complainant under the applicable CA [collective agreement] and does not extend to internal union matters\u2026The Code does not give the Board the authority to review and scrutinize the union\u2019s administration or application of its internal rules.\n\u2026\nIn the present complaint, Messrs. Kopeck, Sidhu and Elie are alleging that the union adopted a new rule, the Pensioner Equalization Rule, which is arbitrary and discriminatory as it provides for different treatment of workers who are in receipt of the industry pension because of their age.\nEven though this is a new dispatch rule, it is still part of a set of dispatch rules adopted by the union in accordance with its internal procedures for the purpose of meeting its dispatch obligations under the CA\u2026.\nThe Board concludes that the DFR is not applicable to these circumstances as there is no right under the CA, as a pensioner, to be dispatched in a certain order. The dispatch rules remain an internal decision and policy of the union. Accordingly, the DFR complaint is dismissed. (Emphasis added)\nCIRB Ruling at page 8\n[32] Regarding the duty of fair referral under s. 69 of the Code, CIRB determined that the Union\u2019s dispatch rules were not discriminatory on the narrow basis that the relevant ITA provisions themselves were not in contravention of the CHRA. As stated by CIRB:\nIn the present case, the complainants argue that by adopting these dispatch rules, the union is discriminating against them on a prohibited ground. They submit that the union is essentially achieving through the establishment of dispatch rules what it can no longer implement directly through mandatory retirement policies as those are contrary to human rights legislation. The complainants argue that the union\u2019s policy constitutes arbitrary and discriminatory conduct as it denies older workers work opportunities and favors younger workers and non-union members (casuals)\u2026\nThe Pensioner Equalization Rule provides that the grandparented pensioners, who would have been required by the Income Tax Act to collect their WIPP benefits [Pension income] by the end of the year that they turn 71, will be subject to the Pensioner Dispatch Rule like any other member who chooses or is required by law to collect the pension benefits. These rules provide that the pensioner would be dispatched after regular members and casual workers since casual workers are not contributing to the industry pension plan.\nThe dispatch rules under review make a distinction based on the operation of the Income Tax Act which forces members to start drawing on their pension benefits at a certain age. As was pointed out by the union, no court or tribunal has found the Income Tax Act provisions that set the age at which contributors must commence collecting pension benefits to be in contravention of the Canadian Human Rights Act. In the Board\u2019s view, a dispatch rule, like the Pensioner Equalization Rule or the Pensioner Dispatch Rule, that makes a distinction based on such a legislative requirement does not constitute discrimination based on age and does not violate the duty of fair referral under the Code.\n(Emphasis added)\nCIRB Ruling at page 10-11\n[33] In contrast to the narrow discrimination issue addressed by CIRB, the question before this Tribunal is not whether the ITA is discriminatory but whether the Union\u2019s policy to treat workers over the age of 71 differently than other workers violated the CHRA based on the legal test for discrimination.\n[34] In accordance with the legal test for discrimination, the Complainants must establish that they experienced an adverse impact in their employment and that their age was a factor in the adverse impact. If the Complainants prove these elements, the burden then shifts to the Union to establish a bona fide occupational requirement to justify their conduct on the basis of factors including health, safety, and cost: Moore v. British Columbia 2012 SCC 61; British Columbia (Public Service Employee Relations Comm.) v. BCGSEU. [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3.\n[35] CIRB did not fully address these broader issues of discrimination that are now before this Tribunal, nor did CIRB apply the legal test for discrimination when ruling on the narrow issue of the Union\u2019s duty of fair referral and fair representation.\n[36] Accordingly, I find that the full scope of the issues before this Tribunal have not previously been determined by CIRB and the pre-conditions for issue estoppel have therefore not been met.\n[37] In the alternative, even if CIRB addressed the same question, then, as a matter of discretion and fairness, I find that issue estoppel should not be applied given my concerns about the quality of the evidence presented and relied upon in each proceeding, and the potential injustice arising from the narrow CIRB Ruling limiting the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of the CHRC Complaints.\nD. The complaints are not an abuse of process\n[38] The Union also submits that proceeding with the CHRC Complaints would be an abuse of process.\n[39] Even in a case where the requirements of issue estoppel are not met, the Tribunal can apply the doctrine of abuse of process to preclude the re-litigation of a matter where it would be abusive to do so: Constantinescu v. Correctional Services Canada 2019 CHRT 49 at paras. 111-112 and 133-137.\n[40] The Supreme Court of Canada in Figliola confirmed several key principles to consider when determining whether there is an abuse of process, including \u201cjudicial economy, consistency, finality, and the integrity of the administration of justice\u201d (at para. 33).\n[41] The application of finality doctrines such as abuse of process, is a highly discretionary exercise driven by the needs of both substantive and procedural justice. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Penner v. Niagara (Regional Police Services Board), 2013 SCC 19, \u201ca judicial doctrine developed to serve the ends of justice should not be applied mechanistically to work an injustice\u201d (at para. 30).\n[42] As noted earlier, CIRB has not fully resolved the question before this Tribunal. As a result, it would not risk offending judicial economy, consistency, finality, and the integrity of the administration of justice to proceed with the complaints. Accordingly, the CHRC Complaints are not an abuse of process.\nE. The complaints are not a collateral attack\n[43] The Union also submits that the CHRC Complaints should be dismissed as a collateral attack on the CIRB Ruling.\n[44] The doctrine of collateral attack prevents a litigant from challenging an order from one forum in another forum, thereby bypassing the appropriate routes of appeal. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in Figliola:\nThe rule against collateral attack similarly attempts to protect the fairness and integrity of the justice system by preventing duplicative proceedings. It prevents a party from using an institutional detour to attack the validity of an order by seeking a different result from a different forum, rather than through the designated appellate or judicial review route: Canada (Attorney General) v. TeleZone Inc., 2010 SCC 62, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 585, and Garland v. Consumers\u2019 Gas Co., 2004 SCC 25, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 629. (at para. 28)\n[45] However, a collateral attack is not to be confused with re-litigation of issues or facts already decided within an Order (Toronto (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79, 2003 SCC 63 at para 33; Garland v. Consumers' Gas Co., 2004 SCC 25 at para 71). Rather, it is a specific doctrine precluding a challenge to an Order or the execution of an Order.\n[46] If a subsequent proceeding does not constitute an attack on a final Order or represent an attempt to preclude the execution of an Order, then the doctrine of collateral attack has no application (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 4th ed. (Toronto: LexisNexis), 2015 at page 469).\n[47] In this case, the Complainants are not seeking to specifically attack a CIRB order regarding the Union\u2019s duty of fair representation or fair referral. Rather, the Complainants are seeking a remedy against their Union at this Tribunal for alleged age-related discrimination under the CHRA on the basis of human rights issues not fully addressed by CIRB.\n[48] In these circumstances, the CHRC Complaints do not constitute a collateral attack on the CIRB Ruling.\nIV.

ORDER 10\nI. OVERVIEW [1] The Estate of Edward Peters (the \u201cEstate\u201d) is the Complainant in this case. Mr. Peters passed away in 2019, a few months after he had filed this complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d).\n[2] The Estate and the Commission have requested that the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) order the Respondent, Peters First Nation (PFN), to disclose certain documents.\n[3] Mr. Peters was a PFN member. The issues as stated in the complaint are basically the following:\na) In the mid 1990s, Mr. Peters\u2019 home located on PFN territory burned down. PFN refused to provide funding or other assistance to enable him to rebuild it. PFN also denied his requests that it build him a new house. He claimed that PFN provided these services to other community members from different family lines.\nb) Mr. Peters was denied attendance and physically removed from band functions, including a meeting of the Chief and Band Council, which he alleged had ordered that he be harassed whenever on the reserve or at band functions.\nc) He and other members of his family were mocked, harassed, and made to feel unwelcome.\n[4] The Estate claims that Mr. Peters\u2019 family status, disability, and age were factors in this treatment and therefore discriminatory under the Canadian Human Rights Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the \u201cAct\u201d).\n[5] The complaint contained several other alleged incidents, but the Estate confirmed that it is not seeking a remedy relating to them.\nII. DECISION [6] I grant the requests in part, noting that PFN has in any event agreed to provide some of the requested documents.\nIII. ISSUES [7] The issues addressed in analyzing each requested document are as follows:\nAre the requested documents in PFN\u2019s possession? If so, do they relate to a fact or issue that is raised in the complaint or to an order that is being sought? If so, should they still be ordered disclosed considering other applicable disclosure principles?\nIV. ANALYSIS A. Disclosure principles [8] Under Rules 18 and following of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137, (the \u201cRules of Procedure\u201d), parties are required to disclose all the documents in their possession that relate to a fact or issue that is raised in the complaint or to an order sought by any of the parties.\n[9] In Brickner v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2017 CHRT 28, at paras. 4-10, the Tribunal set out the following principles that have been developed around disclosure.\n[10] The parties\u2019 duty to disclose is consistent with their right under s. 50(1) of the Act to have a full and ample opportunity to present their case. This requires, among other things, that all arguably relevant information in the possession or care of parties be disclosed to each party before the hearing of the matter. The disclosure of information allows each party to know the case it is up against and, therefore, adequately prepare for the hearing.\n[11] The standard is not a particularly high threshold for the requesting party to meet. If there is a rational connection between a document and the facts, issues, or forms of relief identified by the parties in the matter, the information should be disclosed. However, the disclosure request must not be speculative or amount to a \u201cfishing expedition.\u201d The documents requested must also be identified with reasonable particularity. The Tribunal may exercise its discretion to deny a motion for disclosure, so long as the requirements of natural justice and the Rules of Procedure are respected, to ensure the informal and expeditious conduct of the inquiry.\n[12] The Tribunal may deny a disclosure request where the probative value of the evidence sought would not outweigh its prejudicial effect on the proceedings. Notably, the Tribunal is cautious when an order would subject a party to an onerous and far-reaching search for documents, especially if it would risk adding substantial delay to the efficiency of the inquiry or where the documents are merely related to a side issue rather than the main issues in dispute.\n[13] Pre-hearing disclosure of arguably relevant information does not mean that it will be admitted in evidence at the hearing or that it will be afforded significant weight in the decision-making process.\n[14] Moreover, given that a party\u2019s obligation to disclose is limited to documents that are \u201cin the party\u2019s possession\u201d under the Rules of Procedure, the Tribunal cannot order a party to generate or create new documents for disclosure.\n[15] PFN\u2019s submissions in response to the motions included an affidavit signed by PFN Chief, Norma Webb, to which she attached copies of several of the requested documents.\n[16] My analysis below begins with the documents that PFN does not possess and those that it does not object to disclose, followed by the requests that I grant and then those that I deny. Except where otherwise indicated, the Estate made all the requests.\n[17] The Estate and the Commission take issue with some of PFN\u2019s responses as to what documents are available or in its possession. The parties\u2019 good faith is presumed during the disclosure process. Their assertions can be challenged and tested at the hearing through cross-examination and other means.\nB. Documents that PFN states it does not possess and those that it does not object to disclosing (i) 1977 construction cost of Mr. Peters\u2019 home [18] PFN states that it has not been able to locate any documentation relating to the construction cost of Mr. Peters\u2019 house. It is therefore not in its possession.\n(ii) Complete versions of PFN\u2019s Documents 1, 2, and 3 [19] The requested documents relate to housing renovations for persons other than Mr. Peters. PFN located additional documents regarding house renovations, which were attached to the affidavit.\n(iii) PFN\u2019s renovation expenses for Mr. Peters\u2019 home [20] PFN states that it was only able to locate and provide two documents (one dated June 27, 1980, regarding a loan taken out by Mr. Peters and a \u201cNeeds Identification Form\u201d from 2016) but was unable to locate any documents relating to funds provided by the Government of Canada for Mr. Peter\u2019s home renovations, as requested. The two documents were attached to the affidavit.\n(iv) Fire chief\u2019s report [21] PFN states that it was unable to locate any fire chief\u2019s report, as described in the request. It is therefore not in its possession.\n(v) Victoria Peters\u2019 notes [22] PFN confirms that all of Victoria Peters\u2019 notes were already provided before she became incapacitated due to illness. Once she recovers, PFN\u2019s counsel will ask her to review her file materials once again.\n(vi) History of all PFN home builds and renovations [23] PFN states that it diligently searched the file materials in its possession regarding house renovations and reconstruction on the reserve beyond those already disclosed and that it located a few more. Chief Webb also asked Indigenous Services Canada (ISC) for any documents in its possession relating to this topic. All additional documents obtained to date through the search and from ISC were attached to Chief Webb\u2019s affidavit. PFN undertakes to disclose any additional documents that it uncovers or receives.\n(vii) Commission\u2019s requested documents in paragraph 9 of its motion [24] The Commission requested five documents in paragraph 9 of its motion for disclosure. With respect to items a) to d) of the Commission\u2019s list, PFN confirmed that it undertook further extensive reviews of its file materials and produced all additional documentation regarding renovations or reconstruction of PFN members\u2019 houses that was found. PFN has also requested that a person named Angie Lee, at the ISC, provide any similar documentation. As the Commission points out, PFN did not specify Ms. Lee\u2019s title and role at the ISC. A direction that PFN provide this information is included in my order below.\n[25] Regarding item e) on the Commission\u2019s list, PFN states that no additional documentation was found.\nC. Disclosure requests that are granted (i) PFN\u2019s voting list [26] In its submissions, the Estate notes that PFN said in its Statement of Particulars that it has only 77 members. The Estate claims that reviewing the voting list would make it easy to \u201cdistinguish voting pools by family,\u201d since members of Mr. Peters\u2019 family \u201care known not to vote\u201d for PFN\u2019s Band Council. The Estate also refers to several judgments of the Federal Court involving Mr. Peters\u2019 daughter and the voters list. The Estate points out that under the Indian Band Election Regulations, C.R.C., c. 952, s. 4.2(1)(a), the names of electors are posted, and the lists are therefore public. The Estate submits that full disclosure of the list combined with other evidence will show divisions of family voting pools into those that are privileged and those that are disadvantaged.\n[27] PFN maintains that who is entitled to vote in band elections has no bearing on the replacement of Mr. Peters\u2019 house or his attendance at membership meetings. These matters were never an election issue.\n[28] At the core of the Estate\u2019s complaint is the allegation that Mr. Peters\u2019 family was treated differently than members of other families in relation to the funding of his home reconstruction and his treatment at band meetings. The Estate purports to be able to prepare tables showing alignments between the distribution of band funding and how people voted along family lines. While the probative value of the voting list for this purpose may be limited, the question of how council support is distributed by family is arguably relevant to the Estate\u2019s allegations. Moreover, the lists are public according to the applicable regulations.\n[29] This disclosure request is granted.\n(ii) Band meeting minutes [30] The Estate did not specify the scope of this request. It referred to passages from its and PFN\u2019s Statements of Particulars that mention band meeting minutes. Unfortunately, it seems that the pinpoints of these passages in the Estate\u2019s submissions\u2019 footnotes were mixed up or unclear, and PFN centred its response to this request on those errors, even though it is obvious which passages the Estate meant to refer to.\n[31] Nonetheless, the request as framed by the Estate is too broad. What would clearly be arguably relevant to the complaint is the information as described in the Commission\u2019s reply submissions\u2014any band meeting minutes that relate to Mr. Peters\u2019 request(s) for financial assistance for residential accommodations after his house burned down.\n[32] The disclosure request as reframed by the Commission is granted.\n(iii) PFN\u2019s accounting ledgers [33] PFN had disclosed the 2014-15 ledgers to the Commission at the complaint investigation stage. The Estate claims that an analysis of those ledgers shows adverse differential treatment between Mr. Peters\u2019 family and others. The Estate is asking for other ledgers to further \u201ccement\u201d its allegations, which I understand means to provide additional circumstantial evidence in support of its claim.\n[34] The Commission correctly points out that the Estate\u2019s request, as presented, is too broad. PFN also submitted that the breadth of the Estate\u2019s request was unclear. The Commission requests that the ledgers for home builds and renovations be disclosed from January 1995 (the year when Mr. Peters\u2019 home was inspected) to date. This is a reasonable timeframe and scope.\n[35] This disclosure request, as redefined by the Commission, is granted.\n(iv) Commission\u2019s request for any investigation or security documents (including reports) that reference Mr. Peters between the years of 2015-19 [36] The Commission points out that PFN alleges Mr. Peters made a serious threat to PFN\u2019s Band Council before February 16, 2016, which led to PFN hiring a security firm to be on site when cheques were later distributed. The complaint also brings up security-related issues in its reference to the removal of Mr. Peters\u2019 wife by security staff at the October 2016 band meeting and the fact that he had to follow her out. The police were called in. The Commission therefore submits that any investigation or security documents relating to Mr. Peters between 2015 and 2019, when he died, are relevant and should be disclosed.\n[37] PFN did not address this request in its response to the motions for disclosure.\n[38] I am persuaded, nonetheless, that this information is relevant to issues raised in the complaint and in PFN\u2019s response to it. The disclosure request is granted.\nD. Disclosure requests that are denied (i) Testimony of Swede Peters [39] This individual was mentioned in PFN\u2019s Statement of Particulars. The Estate contends that PFN should be compelled to call him as a witness.\n[40] This request is not a disclosure matter. Parties who wish to ensure the presence of individuals to present evidence at the hearing may ask the Tribunal to issue a summons for their attendance, also known as a subpoena. The Tribunal\u2019s website provides instructions on how to request a subpoena.\n(ii) Complete version of PFN\u2019s Statement of Particulars Document 12 [41] This document was disclosed with PFN\u2019s Statement of Particulars. It is the list that PFN members signed when they picked up their cheques, reflecting a settlement that PFN had reached with the Kinder Morgan company, apparently about the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The names, signatures, and identification cards of PFN members other than Mr. Peters\u2019 have been redacted. The Estate submits that PFN did this intentionally and that disclosing all the names will demonstrate adverse differential treatment of Mr. Peters.\n[42] In contrast, the lists of people who attended the five band meetings to discuss the settlement before the cheques were issued were not redacted. The Estate claims that these lists were not redacted even though they are marked as confidential. This is actually a mischaracterization by the Estate. The first of these lists simply said that the information explained \u201chere,\u201d meaning at the meeting, was to be kept confidential among band members\u2014not that the lists are confidential.\n[43] PFN explains that Document 12 was produced only to confirm the date of the incident when Mr. Peters was forcibly removed from PFN\u2019s band office, as alleged in the complaint. PFN has confidentiality concerns about disclosing the names of the other cheque recipients without their consent.\n[44] I am persuaded by PFN\u2019s argument. The identity of the other PFN members who picked up their cheques is not relevant to the issues in the complaint. The Estate\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars states that Mr. Peters was removed on the date shown on this document, and it confirms that. The other cheque recipients\u2019 names are not relevant.\n(iii) The Seabird documents [45] The Estate made requests for the disclosure of four sets of documents under this heading:\nPeters First Nation Seabird Island Reserve Specific Claim Settlement Agreement Seabird Settlement Band Council Resolutions Seabird Settlement Band List(s) and Voters List(s), Seabird Settlement Information Meeting Attendance Lists\/Sign-in Sheets, and Seabird Settlement Ratification Vote Meeting Attendance Lists\/Sign-in Sheets Seabird Settlement Schedule 3 Voting Guidelines\n[46] The Estate explains that, in 2019, PFN signed an agreement with Canada in the settlement of a land claim involving the Seabird Island Reserve. Mr. Peters died shortly after it was signed. The Estate contends that full disclosure of the agreement and the other requested documents will prove or disprove Mr. Peters\u2019 entitlement under the settlement, which it claims is part of the \u201cpotential remedy\u201d in this case.\n[47] I am not persuaded by this argument. There is no mention whatsoever of the Seabird settlement in the complaint. The Estate\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars only refers to the settlement at two spots. Paragraph 185 states that Mr. Peters or his heirs \u201creceived nothing\u201d from the settlement agreement and that the \u201cBand Council\u2019s families were not similarly affected.\u201d In the remedies section, one of the requested orders is for \u201clump-sum distributions totaling $200,000 (plus interest)\u201d from the land settlement. This remedial request does not link back to any allegation in the complaint.\n[48] In its reply submissions on the motions for disclosure, the Commission contends that the Seabird settlement is an issue in this case because it is referred to in paragraph 185 of the Estate\u2019s Amended Statement of Particulars. I disagree. The settlement is not mentioned anywhere in the complaint, which was referred to the Tribunal for inquiry in November 2022, well over three years after the settlement. I note that the Commission\u2019s Summary of Complaint sheet was amended on July 21, 2022, to add disability and age as grounds of discrimination and to replace Mr. Peters\u2019 name with the Estate\u2019s. No other amendment was made.\n[49] A mere reference to the Seabird settlement in one of the 214 paragraphs of the Amended Statement of Particulars does not constitute an authorized amendment to the complaint that the Commission referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. No request to amend or expand the scope of the complaint to include this matter was ever made.\n[50] The Seabird settlement is clearly not relevant to the issues as set out in the complaint that the Commission referred to the Tribunal for inquiry. The request for these documents is therefore denied.\n(iv) Band Council resolutions proving quorum (as required from time to time) [51] Under this request, the Estate asks for assurances, in the form of a Band Council resolution, that the entire Council is \u201cwell apprised of the history of the above proceeding and in its continuance as currently found.\u201d\n[52] The Estate withdrew this request in its reply submissions and stated that it seeks witness subpoenas instead. This is not a matter for disclosure. The Estate is directed to the Tribunal\u2019s website for instructions on the procedure for requesting subpoenas.\nV. ORDER [53] In its reply submissions, the Estate asked for additional orders unrelated to its and the Commission\u2019s motions for disclosure. They are not properly at issue, and I will not address them in this ruling. The Estate can make separate requests for those orders, which the Commission and PFN will have the opportunity to respond to before the Tribunal rules on them.\n[54] I grant the Estate\u2019s and the Commission\u2019s disclosure requests in part. I order PFN to disclose:\nPFN\u2019s voting list.\nAny band meeting minutes that relate to Mr. Peters\u2019 request(s) for financial assistance for residential accommodations after his house burned down.\nLedgers for home builds and renovations from January 1995 to date.\nAngie Lee\u2019s title and role at ISC and the categories of documents she was asked to look for.\nAny investigation or security documents (including reports) that reference Mr. Peters between the years 2015 and 2019.\n[55] The documents and information must be disclosed within 45 days after this order is communicated to PFN.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 11, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: HR-DP-2903-22\nStyle of Cause:\nThe Estate of Edward Peters v.

The Complainant served as a representative of the Native Women\u2019s Association of Nova Scotia. Mr. Googoo was the Forum\u2019s Executive Chair. The complaints are against the Forum, the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) and Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC).\nThe Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) sent its disclosure package to the AFN and CIRNAC but asked the Tribunal for direction about disclosure to the Forum. The Commission questioned whether the Forum is a legal entity. The AFN said it was not a member of the Forum, did not control the Forum and should not be a respondent. CIRNAC also said it should not be a respondent because it has no employment relationship with the Complainant, had no control over the Forum, Mr. Googoo did not represent CIRNAC, and CIRNAC did not appoint him.\nThe Tribunal must be cautious when asked to dismiss a complaint without a full hearing. The Tribunal concluded that the Forum had not established that it cannot be a respondent. Too many unanswered questions remained about the Forum and whether it is a legal entity against which a human rights complaint can be made.\nThe Tribunal directed the Commission to provide its disclosure package to the Forum\u2019s Executive Committee. The Tribunal denied CIRNAC\u2019s request to be removed as a respondent. The AFN may bring a motion to remove itself as a respondent.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

The hearing, where most of the Complainants\u2019 witnesses testified over the course of two weeks, started in May 2023 with the parties and the Tribunal present in Burns Lake. The hearing then continued for four additional weeks in May and June 2023 via the videoconferencing platform Zoom. The Tribunal has scheduled an additional nearly five weeks of hearing in the fall of 2023 to hear the evidence of several witnesses who will be responding to the Complainants\u2019 evidence about one of their requested remedies. The Respondent, the Royal Canadian Mounter Police, stated its intention to call several senior officers from the North District of British Columbia and someone from its Indigenous policing unit in Burns Lake as witnesses.\nThe Respondent argued that Zoom is not an adequate substitute for an in-person hearing and states that having its witnesses testify in person would have several benefits. For instance, it would show that the Tribunal and the parties are committed to having a presence in the community during the hearing and would allow people to hear and see the evidence in their community and hear and see the officers directly.\nBoth the Complainants and the Canadian Human Rights Commission opposed the request and asked that the Tribunal complete the hearing by videoconference. The Tribunal assesses requests for in-person hearings on a case-by-case basis, considering the preferences and interests of the parties, the fairness and accessibility of the form of hearing, and health and safety requirements. The Tribunal also considers the time, the cost to, and efforts of the parties and the Tribunal in relation to the nature of the proceedings. In this case, the Tribunal determined that holding a hearing via Zoom was preferable. The Tribunal denied the Respondent\u2019s application, and the hearing will proceed by Zoom.\nDecision Content\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation: 2023 CHRT\n42\nDate:\nSeptember 15, 2023\nFile No.:\nT2459\/1620\nBetween:\nCathy Woodgate, Richard Perry, Dorothy Williams, Ann Tom, Maurice Joseph and Emma Williams\nComplainants\n- and -\nCanadian Human Rights Commission\nCommission\n- and -\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police\nRespondent\nRuling\nMember:\nColleen Harrington\nTable of Contents\nI.

Context\n[1] The hearing into this complaint is well underway. The hearing started with the parties and Tribunal in-person in Burns Lake, British Columbia, where most of the Complainants\u2019 witnesses testified over the course of two weeks, from May 1-12, 2023. The hearing then continued using the Zoom videoconferencing platform for four additional weeks in May and June of 2023. The Tribunal has not yet heard all of the evidence that the parties intend to introduce. There are still several witnesses to be called, including evidence related to a particular remedy sought by the Complainants that required a Tribunal Ruling agreeing to allow them to reopen their case (2023 CHRT 21). As such, an additional nearly 5 weeks of hearing have been scheduled in the fall of 2023. The remainder of the hearing is scheduled to take place by videoconference.\n[2] The RCMP have asked the Tribunal to hold another portion of the hearing in-person in Burns Lake in November of 2023, in order to hear from 3 of its witnesses. Although the RCMP made a prior request for the Tribunal to hear from some of its witnesses in-person in Vancouver or Burns Lake, that request was eventually abandoned.\n[3] This Ruling deals with the RCMP\u2019s second request for an in-person hearing in Burns Lake, in November 2023. The Complainants and the Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d) oppose the request and ask that the hearing be completed by videoconference.\nII. The RCMP\u2019s application for an in-person hearing\n[4] The RCMP\u2019s present request was first raised with the Tribunal and parties during a Case Management Conference Call (\u201cCMCC\u201d) on June 12, 2023. According to the CMCC summary, the RCMP stated its intention to call as witnesses some senior officers from the North District of British Columbia, as well as someone from its Indigenous policing unit in Burns Lake. The intention was to call these witnesses to respond to the Complainants\u2019 evidence regarding one of the remedies they are seeking, which will be heard near the end of the hearing. The RCMP indicated it may also want to call an expert in response to the Complainants\u2019 additional evidence.\n[5] The RCMP stated during the June 12th CMCC that it wanted these witnesses to testify in-person in Burns Lake so the community could hear their evidence. The Complainants\u2019 counsel objected to this, noting that the cost to the Complainants to have their counsel travel to Burns Lake again would likely be prohibitive. The Tribunal inquired as to why it would be necessary to hear from these witnesses in-person, since community members could not be compelled to attend and hear the testimony in-person, and those who wish to watch the hearing could continue to do so by video, as they have been doing since late May. However, I indicated that this request could be discussed further at a later date.\n[6] On July 20, 2023, the RCMP wrote to the Tribunal and parties asking that 3 of its witnesses who will be called to respond to the Complainants\u2019 additional remedy evidence be permitted to testify in-person in Burns Lake. These 3 witnesses were identified as Superintendent Dee Stewart of E Division; Chief Superintendent Warren Brown, the North District commanding officer; and one of the three Indigenous Policing Services officers in Burns Lake, who was not identified by name at that time. The RCMP stated its understanding that the Complainants\u2019 remedy evidence would start to be called on November 14, 2023 and so these 3 RCMP witnesses would likely testify sometime during the currently scheduled hearing dates of November 14-24, 2023.\n[7] The RCMP states that having these 3 witnesses testify in person would have several benefits, including that: \u201cPeople would hear and see the evidence in their community once again and, specifically, hear and see the officers directly. It would further show that the Tribunal and parties are committed to having a presence in the community during the hearing and that the officers, and the RCMP, are visible and accountable to the community and the Canadian public.\u201d\n[8] The RCMP argues that Zoom is not an adequate substitute, as \u201cappearing in person links the officers\u2019 testimony with the community and any concerns people there may have. It permits everyone to see and be seen. It allows for a natural dialogue after testimony.\u201d\nIII. Positions of the parties\n[9] The Tribunal heard from the other parties with respect to the RCMP\u2019s request to reconvene in person in November. The Complainants and Commission both oppose the RCMP\u2019s request.\n[10] The Complainants say the costs they would have to incur in order to have their legal counsel attend and conduct the hearing in-person in Burns Lake would be substantial and, in their view, unnecessary. They ask the Tribunal to recognize that the Complainants have extremely limited financial resources, particularly in comparison to the RCMP. They say the RCMP is aware of this, as the Complainants already raised this during the June 12, 2023 CMCC when the RCMP first made this request. I note that, during the June 12th CMCC I asked the RCMP\u2019s counsel if the RCMP would consider paying the travel and accommodation costs of the Complainants\u2019 counsel. He said he would look into this. No further information has been provided with regard to this request, nor was it addressed in the RCMP\u2019s written submissions.\n[11] The Complainants also state that the issues the RCMP relies upon as forming the basis for its request to reconvene the hearing in-person can be addressed in other ways. They state that, if the RCMP wants the officers to be visible in Burns Lake, they need not wait for the Tribunal hearing to do so: \u201cThey can make themselves visible and accountable to the Burns Lake Community and the Canadian public in many other ways without burdening the Indigenous Complainants with the cost of having an in-person hearing.\u201d\n[12] Similarly, the Complainants argue that, if the RCMP seeks to have a \u201cnatural dialogue\u201d following the testimony of its witnesses, \u201cthey are more than welcome to have their officers present in the community while they testify by [Z]oom and invite the community to a meeting afterward.\u201d\n[13] The Complainants argue that conducting the hearing over Zoom actually allows more people in more communities to have access to the hearing than if it is conducted in-person in Burns Lake. They state that the case is being observed over Zoom throughout BC and in multiple provinces. An in-person hearing in Burns Lake would exclude those who do not live there.\n[14] The Complainants note that the reason they had requested an in-person hearing in Burns Lake for the first two weeks of the hearing, when most of their witnesses testified, was because many of the 14 witnesses who testified did not have access to the internet and\/or they required in-person support from Indian Residential School Survivors Society (\u201cIRSSS\u201d) counselors, who were present during the hearing. The Complainants point out that the RCMP officers proposed to be called in November of 2023 have neither of these difficulties or requirements.\n[15] The Commission agrees with the Complainants that the hearing dates in question should be held by videoconference, not in-person. It shares the Complainants\u2019 concerns, especially with respect to barriers to participation that may arise if the hearing is in-person, given the Tribunal\u2019s inability to broadcast the in-person proceedings by Zoom. The Commission is also concerned that the time set aside for that portion of the hearing would be shortened if the hearing takes place in-person, since the parties may need to travel to and from Burns Lake during the week.\nIV. Decision\n[16] For the reasons set out below, I deny the RCMP\u2019s application to reconvene in-person in Burns Lake to hear the evidence of 3 of its witnesses who will be responding to the Complainants\u2019 evidence about one of their requested remedies.\nV. Reasons\n[17] Prior to March of 2020, the Tribunal conducted most, if not all, of its hearings in-person in communities across Canada. Due to the global health crisis caused by Covid-19, the Tribunal, like many other tribunals and courts across the country, quickly transitioned to using videoconferencing platforms to conduct its hearings. The Tribunal has been conducting most of its hearings by videoconference since then, finding this technology to be cost effective and easy to use, and enabling the Tribunal to conduct its complaint inquiries fairly and efficiently.\n[18] As public health restrictions have eased, the Tribunal has returned to offering in-person hearings upon request, as well as hybrid hearings, although the majority of hearings continue to proceed fully by videoconference.\n[19] The Tribunal has previously determined that the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c.H-6 [CHRA] essentially requires the Tribunal to \u201censure the venue for the hearing meets the standards of the CHRA that require a fair, informal, expeditious and open hearing process, where each party is given a full and ample opportunity to appear, present evidence and make representations (see ss. 48.9(1), 50(1) and 52(1) of the CHRA)\u201d (Temple v Horizon International Distributors, 2016 CHRT 20 (CanLII) at para 11). The Tribunal has concluded that videoconference hearings meet these requirements (Hugie v T-Lane Transportation and Logistics, 2020 CHRT 25 (CanLII) [Hugie]).\n[20] The Tribunal has determined that videoconferencing is an entirely appropriate alternative to an in-person hearing, one that is fair and equitable and that protects the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness (Hugie at para 21; Duverger v 2553-4330 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (A\u00e9ropro), 2018 CHRT 12 (CanLII) [Duverger] at paras 27-36).\n[21] This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal will not consider requests such as the RCMP\u2019s. The Tribunal in Duverger stated that:\n[I]n certain circumstances, the Tribunal may decide that the use of videoconferencing would not be appropriate, such as cases in which a person has certain disabilities, where the matter is highly complex, or where the available technologies cannot provide sufficient videoconferencing quality. These examples are not exhaustive and the Tribunal should assess the circumstances and make decisions on a case-by-case basis (at para 38).\n[22] Indeed, requests for in-person hearings are assessed on a case-by-case basis, with the Tribunal considering the preferences and interests of the parties, the fairness and accessibility of the form of hearing, and health and safety requirements. Proportionality is also a factor, meaning the Tribunal will consider the cost, time and effort for the parties and for the Tribunal relative to the nature of the proceeding.\nA. Having its witnesses appear by videoconference is not unfair to the RCMP [23] In its reply submissions, the RCMP states that, \u201cAs the Tribunal granted the Complainants\u2019 request for their lay witnesses to testify in person in Burns Lake and effectively denied our request for the same for Sgt. Mackie, it should grant the present request to ensure fairness and balance in the hearing.\u201d\n[24] The RCMP is suggesting that fairness requires the Tribunal to treat all parties the same. Such an approach is not consistent with the requirement to consider each motion or application on the basis of its own facts.\n[25] The Complainants\u2019 request for their witnesses to be heard in-person, made in November of 2022, was based in part on their Indigenous traditions to \u201ctransmit knowledge orally and in person.\u201d Their request stated that:\nTraditions for Indigenous people mean that when we talk, we meet in circles, and we do certain ceremonies that honour why telling the truth is so important, and why listening to others is also so important. The \u201cjustice system\u201d and Canada have not listened. We have tried for many decades to tell these stories.\nWe don\u2019t want the person making decisions about whether what we are saying is true or not be outside of our circle. Most people do not have a computer \u2013 we cannot \u201czoom\u201d in. We will tell our stories and we expect the person listening to them to also be there in person.\nCathy Woodgate is no longer alive. She was deprived of telling her story to the human-rights tribunal. She, Emma Williams and Ann Tom\u2014who were some of the brave people who made the complaint against the RCMP\u2014are no longer alive. Other witnesses, siblings and friends are no longer alive. In their honour, in the honour of dozens of other people who died before they could tell their stories about the diocese schools, and in our honour, we ask that Member Harrington respect our traditional culture and see and talk to us in person.\n[26] The Tribunal accepted the Complainants\u2019 request to attend in-person, with the consent of all parties. Ceremonies were held throughout this in-person portion of the hearing that all parties benefited from.\n[27] In addition to its argument that the Tribunal should hear some of its witnesses in-person because it heard from most of the Complainants\u2019 witnesses this way, the RCMP\u2019s argument relates mainly to its desire for the Complainants and the community of Burns Lake to hear their evidence in the community. The RCMP wants to show it is committed to having a presence there and to show that it is visible and accountable to the community and the Canadian public.\n[28] In its reply submissions, the RCMP argues that its request aligns with the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the Complainants\u2019 request to be heard in-person. It says the evidence relating to the community is best heard in the community, concluding that Superintendent Dee Stewart, Chief Superintendent Warren Brown, and Sergeant Joe Garcia \u201cwill testify about community outreach and work by the RCMP in Burns Lake and the First Nation communities.\u201d\n[29] The RCMP does not need to have 3 of its witnesses testify in Burns Lake in order for people in Burns Lake or across Canada to witness their testimony. In fact, the videoconference portion of the hearing has been much more accessible to the public than the in-person portion was. The Tribunal was not able to broadcast the hearing when it was in-person in Burns Lake so the oral evidence given there was heard only by those present. Since then, anyone who has wanted to watch the Zoom hearing has been able to do so, so long as they are not subject to a witness exclusion order and they agree to comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Order that is in place.\n[30] Community members in and around Burns Lake, and others from across Canada, have been watching the videoconference portion of the hearing, including the evidence of all of the RCMP\u2019s witnesses so far. People in Burns Lake who either do not have a device or internet to watch the hearing at home or wish to do so with others and with the IRSSS counselors present for support, may attend the room at the Ts\u2019il Kaz Koh Band Office that the Tribunal has reserved for this purpose.\n[31] With regard to any \u201cdialogue\u201d the RCMP wishes to have with the community, that is not the underlying purpose of an adversarial hearing before the Tribunal. However, both the RCMP and the community are of course free to initiate such a dialogue on their own. Presumably there is no reason why their witnesses could not be present in Burns Lake to testify by Zoom if they so desire. I would note, however, that even if the Tribunal were to go back to Burns Lake for the hearing, there is no guarantee that members of the community would come to see the RCMP\u2019s evidence in person.\n[32] I also disagree with the RCMP\u2019s position that Zoom is not an adequate substitute for appearing in person. As the Tribunal stated in Hugie, supra:\n[28] In a virtual hearing held by videoconference, the witness is live before the member, and the member, live before the witness. As when a witness appears in person before a member, the member can observe the witness\u2019s non-verbal behaviour, but also ensure and control that the correct procedures with respect to testimony are being followed.\n[33] Indeed, the parties have had no difficulty in communicating their objections during the questioning of most of the witnesses during the videoconference portion of the hearing.\n[34] Finally, the RCMP\u2019s argument that the evidence of Superintendent Stewart, Chief Superintendent Brown and Sergeant Garcia will \u201crelate to the community\u201d more than any of the other evidence given by RCMP witnesses, including the evidence of the investigating officers and their supervisors, is difficult to understand. None of these 3 witnesses was present on the RCMP\u2019s witness list until well after the hearing commenced, despite the requirement to provide a witness list prior to the hearing, and the RCMP\u2019s knowledge of all of the remedies sought by the Complainants well in advance of the hearing. While the Tribunal looks forward to hearing their evidence, I see no compelling reason for the Tribunal and parties to be physically present in Burns Lake in order to do so.\n[35] I note that the RCMP has not argued that it would be prejudiced if these 3 witnesses must testify by video as opposed to in-person. All of its witnesses have so far testified by videoconference without issue. I do not see any prejudice to any party in requiring the hearing to continue to be conducted via videoconference as we have successfully done for 4 weeks already.\n[36] There would be real prejudice to the Complainants, however, to have to incur the significant cost of reconvening in-person. Section 50(1) of the CHRA requires the Tribunal to ensure all parties have a full and ample opportunity, on their own behalf or through counsel, to present evidence and make representations. Testifying in-person is not a prerequisite to this requirement being met. Indeed, in this particular situation, agreeing to the RCMP\u2019s request may result in a disadvantage to the Complainants in this regard. The Complainants\u2019 position is that the cost of having their counsel appear in-person in Burns Lake again would be very substantial and they are of modest means. It is entirely possible that, if the RCMP\u2019s application is granted, the Complainants\u2019 opportunity to present evidence and make representations through counsel may be adversely affected.\n[37] The Tribunal is also mindful of incurring further costs to the Canadian taxpayer, if all of the Tribunal, RCMP and Commission were to have to travel back to Burns Lake again to hear from 3 witnesses.\nB. The RCMP\u2019s previous request was not \u201ceffectively denied\u201d by the Tribunal [38] I disagree with the RCMP\u2019s assertion that the Tribunal effectively denied its request for Sergeant Mackie to testify in-person in Burns Lake. The RCMP initially requested, during a CMCC on January 17, 2023, that its witnesses testify in Vancouver, since the Complainants\u2019 witnesses would be testifying in Burns Lake. This was the RCMP\u2019s first request for an in-person hearing. In my written directions of February 8, 2023, I declined this request, stating that at that time it was still the exception, rather than the rule, to hold hearings in-person. However, I stated that, if there was a reason beyond the preference of counsel or their client or witnesses to hold part of the hearing in-person in Vancouver, as there was in the case of the Complainants\u2019 request, the RCMP could make this request in writing.\n[39] On February 23, 2023, the RCMP requested in writing that 2 or 3 of its witnesses, including Sergeant Mackie and Constable Cox, testify in Burns Lake in either May or June. This request was made for 3 reasons.\n[40] The first reason, described as the most important, was \u201creconciliation.\u201d The RCMP said that the investigation that is the subject of this human rights complaint was carried out in a \u201cthorough and careful\u201d manner, and it wanted the community to hear the investigating officers testify about this in person and \u201csee the spirit in which they undertook the investigation.\u201d\n[41] The second reason was that a videoconference is no substitute for observing a witness in person. Because officers Cox and Mackie would have substantial evidence to give, as they conducted the investigation that is the subject of this complaint, the RCMP asked the Tribunal to hear from them personally, not via a screen.\n[42] The third reason was fairness. The RCMP suggested that, in order for justice to be seen to be done, the Tribunal should hear from its witnesses in person. Its argument was the same as in the present request, that proceeding with the RCMP\u2019s evidence by videoconference while the Tribunal heard from the Complainants\u2019 witnesses in-person could give the perception of an unbalanced field.\n[43] The RCMP\u2019s request was discussed during a CMCC on February 27, 2023. The summary from that CMCC notes that the RCMP would likely want to call its witnesses in-person sometime during the scheduled hearing dates in June. The Complainants\u2019 counsel noted that it would be cost prohibitive for her clients to have her to attend in-person a second time in Burns Lake, since she would already be attending in-person for 2 weeks in May, but that she would ask them if they were opposed to the RCMP testifying in-person in Burns Lake. I indicated the issue could be discussed further to decide how and where these officers would testify.\n[44] At the next CMCC on April 14, 2023, the Complainants\u2019 counsel indicated that it was the Complainants\u2019 preference that no RCMP personnel attend the hearing, although they understood that the RCMP was a party and had a right to do so.\n[45] As per the summary of the February 27, 2023 CMCC, there was further discussion about how and where the officers would testify. Well after the hearing started, the RCMP advised that two of the three investigating officers, Constables Cox and Hanley, would be unable to testify at the hearing at all due to health issues. The RCMP advised that Sergeant Mackie would testify by videoconference, which he did for several days in June of 2023. As it took somewhat longer than expected for the Complainants to finish calling their evidence, all parties and the Respondent\u2019s witnesses, including Sergeant Mackie, were cooperative and showed flexibility to ensure all witnesses could be heard. I note that there was also a request for the Tribunal and parties to accommodate Sergeant Mackie\u2019s schedule as he had appointments to attend, and this was done.\n[46] We were able to deal with these scheduling issues easily enough because the hearing was proceeding by videoconference. I also note that, when asked by the Tribunal directly, counsel for the RCMP confirmed that the RCMP\u2019s first request for in-person testimony by its witnesses had been abandoned.\nVI. Conclusion [47] I am of the view that finishing the hearing by videoconference upholds the Tribunal\u2019s obligation to proceed both fairly and expeditiously, in accordance with section 48.9(1) of the CHRA.\n[48] The RCMP\u2019s application is denied.\nSigned by\nColleen Harrington\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nSeptember 15, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2459\/1620\nStyle of Cause:\nWoodgate et al v.

The decision will be published in both official languages once the translation is finalized, as required by the Official Languages Act.\nSummary:\nDenny Bilac, a transgender man, filed a complaint against NC Tractor, his employer, Arthur Currie, the owner of NC Tractor, and Shona Abbey, an employee of NC Tractor (the \u201cRespondents\u201d).\nMr. Bilac alleges that the Respondents harassed him on the basis of gender identity or expression and failed to provide a harassment-free work environment, contrary to section 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA).\nThe Tribunal agreed with Mr. Bilac and found that both Mr. Currie and Ms. Abbey engaged in harassment against Mr. Bilac. Specifically, the Tribunal found that Mr. Currie and Ms. Abbey repeatedly misgendered Mr. Bilac. They also engaged in \u201cdeadnaming\u201d against Mr. Bilac, which involved referring to him by his assigned name at birth. In addition, Mr. Currie also engaged in discriminatory harassment against Mr. Bilac on the basis of gender identity or expression by making comments and asking questions that communicated Mr. Currie\u2019s belief that Mr. Bilac was not really a man.\nThe Tribunal also found that the Respondents failed to meet the conditions in section 65(2) of the CHRA to avoid fault for the discriminatory harassment. Specifically, the Tribunal found that NC Tractor did not engage in \u201call due diligence\u201d to prevent the harassment since nothing was done to prevent the deadnaming and misgendering that occurred while Mr. Bilac was employed.\nAs a remedy, the Tribunal reviewed the authorities and ordered $15,000 in damages for pain and suffering under section 53(2)(e) of the CHRA and $3,000 in damages for special compensation under section 53(3) of the CHRA. The Tribunal did not order compensation for lost wages because it found that there was no causal connection between the discrimination and the lost wages he claimed. The Tribunal did not order Mr. Currie and Ms. Abbey to undergo training because their employment status was unknown, and NC Tractor was no longer a functional company. However, if NC Tractor becomes operational under Mr. Currie in the one year following the decision, then he is required to contact the Canadian Human Rights Commission in order to receive training for him and his employees about harassment in relation to trans and gender diverse individuals.\nThe Tribunal also found NC Tractor and Mr. Currie jointly and severally responsible to pay 80% of the pain and suffering award and 100% of the special compensation award. By contrast, the Tribunal found Ms. Abbey responsible for only 20% of the award for pain and suffering. This is because the Tribunal found that Mr. Currie was responsible for more discriminatory behaviour than Ms. Abbey.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

The complainant says that Mr. Pridmore, one of the respondents, sexually harassed and assaulted her during her employment. For her, revealing private and sensitive medical information to the person who assaulted her would worsen the violation she experienced. It would also add to her psychological trauma. The Tribunal agrees to make an order for limited confidentiality, that is to say, an order that certain information stays private. Its order finds the right balance between the interest of the respondents to know and respond to the case against them and that of the complainant to maintain privacy over her medical records that were shared with the Tribunal.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

Order made 4\nI. Ruling [1] The Complainants SM, SV, and JR, who are of South Asian descent, are police officers employed by the Respondent Royal Canadian Mounted Police (\u201cRCMP\u201d). Their complaints center around the RCMP\u2019s failure to promote them while they worked at an RCMP unit in Ontario (the \u201cUnit\u201d) and on the alleged systemic racism in the Unit\u2019s promotional processes generally. This, they say, constitutes discrimination contrary to sections 7 and 10 of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d) on the basis of color, national or ethnic origin, race, and\/or religion.\n[2] The RCMP denies discriminating against the Complainants during the promotional processes at issue, or at all, and denies any systemic policy or practice of denying promotional opportunities to the Complainants or other officers who identify as visible minorities in the Unit.\n[3] The issues of liability and remedy for the complaints have been bifurcated on consent of the parties, and a three-week hearing on liability is scheduled to proceed on November 14, 2023.\n[4] In October 2021, I granted the RCMP\u2019s motion, on consent of the Complainants, for a broad confidentiality order restricting public disclosure of information. The order anonymized the names of the Complainants and the Unit as well as the nature of the operations (\u201cOperations\u201d) conducted by the Unit on the basis that public disclosure of this information would be injurious to national security, to sensitive RCMP Operations, and to officer safety: SM, SV, and JR v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2021 CHRT 35 (\u201cConfidentiality Ruling\u201d)\n[5] The RCMP has now filed a motion, on consent of the Complainants, for an order that the hearing be closed to the public. The Canadian Human Rights Commission has elected not to participate at the hearing and did not provide a position on the motion.\n[6] For reasons that follow, I allow the RCMP\u2019s motion and order that the hearing scheduled to proceed on November 14, 2023 be closed to the public.\nII. Legal framework [7] Court proceedings, including those of this Tribunal, are presumptively open to the public and the open court principle is essential to the proper functioning of Canadian democracy.\n[8] However, Canadian law recognizes that there are times when there needs to be discretionary limits on court openness in order to protect other public interests where they arise. The need for this flexibility in the application of the open court principle for the Tribunal is set out in section 52 of the CHRA which provides broad statutory powers to the Tribunal to make any order it considers necessary to ensure the confidentiality of an inquiry in certain circumstances. This includes where there is a serious possibility that the safety of a person will be endangered, or where there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed, fairness of the inquiry will be impacted, or undue hardship will befall a party or witness.\n[9] The Supreme Court of Canada in Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25 (\u201cSherman Estate\u201d) reaffirmed the high bar that must be met to limit court openness. In order to succeed in limiting presumptive court openness, an applicant must establish that:\ncourt openness poses a serious risk to an important public interest;\nthe order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and,\nas a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects.\n(Sherman Estate at para 38).\n[10] The Sherman Estate test, which applies to various types of discretionary limits on openness including sealing orders, publication orders, redaction orders, and orders excluding the public from a hearing, is generally consistent with, and informs the statutory analysis the Tribunal must undertake under s. 52 of the CHRA: A.B. and Gracie v. Correctional Service Canada, 2022 CHRT 15 at para. 15-16; SV SM, JR v. RCMP, 2021 CHRT 35 at para. 8-11.\nIII. Analysis [11] As set out below, I find that the RCMP\u2019s motion for a hearing closed to the public meets the test set out in s.52 of the CHRA as informed by Sherman Estate.\nA. There is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed [12] As set out in the Confidentiality Ruling, disclosure of identifying and investigative information in this case would pose serious and substantial risks to important public security interests including national security, sensitive RCMP Operations, and officer safety as evidenced by the uncontested affidavit filed by the RCMP Inspector in charge of the Unit: SM, SV, and JR v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2021 CHRT 35 at para. 12-14\n[13] I am satisfied that there is a real and substantial risk that disclosure of identifying information about members conducting Operations in the course of a public hearing, including through their identification as a Complainant or witness to these proceedings, could endanger officer safety and compromise RCMP Operations and national security.\n[14] I am further satisfied that there is a real and substantial risk that disclosure of investigative information about previous or ongoing Operations investigations and techniques at the hearing, including through witness testimony and submissions, could compromise RCMP Operations and national security.\nB. Reasonable alternative measures to a closed hearing will not prevent the risk [15] I find that excluding the public from the hearing is necessary to mitigate the above-noted risks, and there are no reasonable alternative measures to protect confidential information from public disclosure.\n[16] The RCMP submits, and I accept as reasonable, that witness testimony at the hearing will cover the substantive work experience of the Complainants and other members conducting the Operations. The content of this testimony is anticipated to primarily and extensively cover information protected from disclosure to the public pursuant to the Confidentiality Ruling, including Operations investigations and techniques, and the members\u2019 involvement in the Operations.\n[17] Given the broad scope of the Confidentiality Ruling and the nature of the anticipated evidence and submissions at the hearing, I find that it is not reasonably possible to mitigate the risks while conducting an effective hearing without excluding the public.\nC. The need for a closed hearing outweighs the societal interests that the inquiry be conducted in public [18] Finally, I am satisfied that the benefits of a closed hearing outweigh any negative effect on court openness.\n[19] The order will protect RCMP Operations and officer safety by allowing the RCMP to continue to effectively gather evidence relating to serious criminal activities in Canada, including threats to national security.\n[20] No party to the proceedings will be prejudiced by the confidentiality order made by the Tribunal as the order is directed to the public and does not impact any party. Further, the public will have access to the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for judgment following the hearing, thereby allowing the public an understanding of the Tribunal\u2019s rationale behind its ruling.\nIV. Order made [21] For reasons set out above, the RCMP\u2019s motion is allowed. The hearing scheduled for November 14, 2023 will be closed to the public.\nSigned by\nPaul Singh\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nOctober 17, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File: T2635\/1121, T2636\/1221, T2637\/1321\nStyle of Cause: SM, SV and JR v.

The Tribunal closed his case when Mr. Foley didn\u2019t respond to the Tribunal\u2019s messages.\nMr. Foley told the Tribunal he was in Spain and couldn\u2019t talk to the Tribunal at that time because he was making a refugee claim. After his refugee claim was rejected, he returned to Canada and asked the Tribunal about his case.\nThe Tribunal agreed that Mr. Foley was in Spain and didn\u2019t receive all of its messages. The Tribunal also agreed that Mr. Foley believed he couldn\u2019t talk to the Tribunal while making his refugee claim in Spain. Mr. Foley asked the Tribunal about his case shortly after coming back from Spain.\nIn this case, it was unfair to Mr. Foley to close his case when he couldn\u2019t respond. Therefore, this is an unusual case where it makes sense to reopen the file.\nThe Tribunal noted that it can and should be fair and speedy. Accordingly, the Tribunal gave the parties options to make the hearing simpler and easier.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

The Commission asked the Tribunal to hold an inquiry into the complaint.\n[2] The Respondent requests that the Tribunal issue a confidentiality order anonymizing the identities of the Complainant and the witnesses in this case, based on the requirements of s. 18(1) of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act, RSC, 1985. c. C-23 (\u201cCSIS Act\u201d).\n[3] For the following reasons, I grant the order but subject to certain conditions.\nThe Respondent\u2019s Request for a Confidentiality Order [4] Section 52(1) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c. H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d) states that Tribunal inquiries are conducted in public. This reflects the principle that hearing processes should be held in the open. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in Sherman Estate v. Donovan, 2021 SCC 25 (CanLII) (\u201cSherman Estate\u201d) at para. 1, the open court principle is protected by the constitutionally\u2011entrenched right of freedom of expression and, as such, it represents a central feature of a liberal democracy.\n[5] However, exceptional circumstances do arise where competing interests justify a restriction to the open court principle (Sherman Estate at para. 3). Thus, in the present context, under s. 52(1)(a) of the CHRA, Tribunal members may take any measures and make any order to ensure their confidentiality of an inquiry if they are satisfied there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed.\n[6] The Respondent claims that there is such a risk in this case. It points to s. 18(1) of the CSIS Act, which reads, in material part:\n(\u2026) no person shall knowingly disclose any information that they obtained or to which they had access in the course of the performance of their duties and functions under this Act or their participation in the administration or enforcement of this Act and from which could be inferred the identity of an employee who was, is or is likely to become engaged in covert operational activities of the Service or the identity of a person who was an employee engaged in such activities.\n(emphasis added)\n[7] Section 18(2) provides that a person may disclose this information for several reasons, including \u201cas required by any other law,\u201d as stated in the English version of the CSIS Act, or \u201csi une autre r\u00e8gle de droit l\u2019exige\u201d in the French version. Section 18(3) goes on to provide that those who contravene s. 18(1) are guilty of an indictable offence or an offence punishable on summary conviction.\n[8] The Respondent submits that the disclosure of the names of the Complainant and other current or past CSIS employees mentioned in the Complainant\u2019s Statement of Particulars is a potential breach of s. 18. During the inquiry, the parties will by necessity disclose information through documents or testimony that will identify current or past CSIS employees. The disclosure of their identities can cause a real and substantial risk to national security.\n[9] The Complainant filed her human rights complaint using her full name. However, she consents to the Respondent\u2019s request, subject to several \u201climitations and practical considerations.\u201d To begin with, she points out that s. 18(1) does not extend to all CSIS employees, only those who were or are likely to become engaged in covert operational activities.\n[10] Furthermore, she submits that the Tribunal\u2019s order should require that individual employees\u2019 actual initials be used, and in a consistent manner throughout the hearing process to enable the Tribunal and the parties to identify individual employees and understand their roles and responsibilities, as well as their involvement in events and the drafting of documents. The full title of each employee\u2019s position within the CSIS hierarchy should also be given.\n[11] Finally, the Complainant asks that the Respondent be required to disclose an employee\u2019s full name at the Complainant\u2019s request if, for instance, their initials or title alone are insufficient to identify who they are and their involvement in the events at issue. The parties would undertake not to publicize the information nor submit it to the Tribunal.\n[12] The Commission also consents to the Respondent\u2019s request, subject to the same conditions outlined by the Complainant. The Commission underscores that it, in particular, may need to have an employee\u2019s full identity disclosed to it in some instances, since the Commission will not have the same knowledge and experience about CSIS\u2019s operations as the Complainant.\n[13] The Respondent objects to the request that actual initials of the individuals\u2019 names be used. It submits that they can be adequately identified by references to position titles and dates. Each person would be consistently identified in all documentation with the same random initials or other identifiers. The Respondent also submits that it cannot disclose the full names of employees under any circumstances.\nAnalysis [14] As the Tribunal noted in SM, SV and JR v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police, 2021 CHRT 35 (CanLII), the analysis of confidentiality requests made under s. 52 of the CHRA are informed by the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s test in Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 2002 SCC 41 (CanLII) (\u201cSierra Club\u201d). In Sherman Estate, the Court stated at para. 43 that the Sierra Club test continues to be an appropriate guide for judicial discretion in such cases. According to the test, as recast in Sherman Estate at para. 38, the person asking a court or tribunal to exercise its discretion in a way that limits the presumption that hearings are held in open court must establish that:\nA. Court openness poses a serous risk to an important public interest;\nB. The order sought is necessary to prevent this serious risk to the identified interest because reasonable alternative measures will not prevent this risk; and,\nC. As a matter of proportionality, the benefits of the order outweigh its negative effects.\nThere is a serious risk to an important public interest [15] I am satisfied that there is a serious risk to an important public interest if the names of the individuals contemplated in s. 18 of the CSIS Act were disclosed. As the Federal Court stated in Jaballah (Re), 2009 FC 279 (CanLII), at para. 20, as a matter of general principle, Canada\u2019s national security requires that CSIS officers who engage, or will engage, in operational activities not be hindered or prevented from continuing such activities, or be put at risk, because their identities are disclosed in court proceedings. Reframed in the context of s. 52(1) of the CHRA, there is a real and substantial risk that matters involving public security will be disclosed if these employees\u2019 identities are revealed.\nThe order is necessary and reasonable alternative measures will not prevent the serious risk to the important public interest [16] As just noted, there is an important public interest in protecting the identity of these individuals from public disclosure. The least intrusive measure to achieve this result is to anonymize their identities while at the same time conducting the hearing in public and issuing a decision that is otherwise unaffected. The fairness of the inquiry will not be affected as long as the other parties are able to know the individuals\u2019 identity, and the anonymization of their names will not impede the Complainant\u2019s ability to pursue her complaint.\n[17] However, the scope of the order should not extend beyond the specific group of employees who require the protection provided by s. 18 of the CSIS Act, namely only those who were or are likely to become engaged in covert operational activities. The Respondent asked that the anonymization order apply to the Complainant\u2019s name. Based on her position title at CSIS, as described in her complaint and in the parties\u2019 Statements of Particulars, I am satisfied that the Complainant is one of those employees.\n[18] As for the Complainant\u2019s and Commission\u2019s request that the employees\u2019 actual initials be used, this does present a risk that a third party, with some research, could identify the employee. I am not persuaded, however, that by merely giving title positions and dates, the Complainant and the Commission will adequately be able to know which person is involved in each issue. The legal principles of procedural fairness dictate that at a minimum the other parties be able to learn the identity of the anonymized party in confidence. The Complainant was already a CSIS employee and both she and the Commission are represented by legal counsel who are subject to an implied undertaking that the information they acquire during the hearing process will remain confidential and only be used internally for the purposes of the hearing.\n[19] Accordingly, the Respondent will have to disclose an employee\u2019s name to the Complainant or the Commission if they are unable to identify the person from the position or other provided information. It is understood that the Complainant and the Commission will only make such requests when they have exhausted all efforts at determining the employee\u2019s identity from the other information.\nThe benefit of the order outweighs its negative effects [20] As the Respondent points out, there is an important public interest in preventing the disclosure of these employees\u2019 identities and ensuring that they not be put at risk in carrying out the national security operations of CSIS. This important need to protect national security activities outweighs the negative effects arising from the anonymization of the proceedings. The inquiry will still be public. There will be no impact on any decision issued in this case other than the anonymization of certain at-risk individuals\u2019 names. The parties will always know who is being referred to either from their personal knowledge and other information or by being given the person\u2019s name in confidence.\n[21] I therefore find that the three parts of the Sierra Club test have been met and that in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s authority under s. 52 of the CHRA, a confidentiality order should be granted with the conditions set out below:\nOrder [22] I order that:\nAny information identifying the Complainant or any current or past employee of CSIS who was, is or is likely to become engaged in covert operational activities of CSIS, or any person who was a CSIS employee engaged in such activities (a \u201cConfidential CSIS Employee\u201d) is designated to be confidential information (the \u201cConfidential Information\u201d) under s. 52 of CHRA; The Complainant will be identified only by the pseudonym \u201cAB\u201d in all documents and pleadings filed with the Tribunal, as well as all correspondence between parties and with the Tribunal, and in all Tribunal Rulings and Decisions, until further order of the Tribunal; Any hard copy documents filed by the parties containing Confidential Information must be placed in a sealed envelope marked confidential and shall not be made part of the public record, provided that a public version of the material from which the Confidential Information is redacted or removed is also filed on the public record; The Respondent may identify any Confidential CSIS Employee in any document filed with the Tribunal solely and consistently by the same random initials or other pseudonym and must include their position title; At the request of the Complainant or the Commission, the full name of a Confidential CSIS Employee must be disclosed where the position title and other provided information alone are insufficient to identify who the employee is and their involvement in an issue; If the full name of a Confidential CSIS Employee is disclosed to the Complainant or Commission, they must keep the information in confidence and cannot publicize it nor include it with any documentation submitted to the Tribunal; and All parties must respect the confidentiality of the information by not referring to any Confidential Information in any public proceedings and by only referring to Confidential CSIS Employees by the random initials or other pseudonyms assigned to them.\nSigned by\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nFebruary 8, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2715\/9121\nStyle of Cause:\nAB v.

While they are all against separate government departments, they share the same alleged basis for discrimination: he claims he was not hired or promoted due to his race. All the parties from all of the complaints jointly asked the Tribunal to \u201cbifurcate\u201d their hearings. That means splitting a hearing into two parts. The first would be to determine whether there was discrimination. The second part would decide how much compensation Mr. Davidson should receive if the government departments discriminated against him. Because there are three complaints, that would mean six hearings in total.\nThe Tribunal decided that this was not a reasonable use of time and resources and said no to the request. Instead, the Tribunal made decisions about the order in which it will hear the complaints.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

Therefore, the Tribunal will start with Mr. Richards\u2019 evidence even though the Commission and Correctional Services Canada, the Respondent, want almost a year to finish their expert reports.

This case has been with the Tribunal for several years. The parties have raised many complex issues. The Tribunal has heard all the evidence about discrimination, some at an in-person hearing in Burns Lake, British Columbia, in the spring of 2023 and the rest by Zoom. There are just a few days of hearing left, on a very specific item the Complainants are requesting as a remedy.\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police agreed with the AGBC\u2019s application, but the Commission and the Complainants did not. The Tribunal analyzed the rules and tests for adding a party and found that the AGBC did not qualify. The AGBC is a provincial entity. The Tribunal does not have any powers over provincial entities. Even if it did, adding a party at this late stage would be very unfair. Instead, the Tribunal exercised its powers and added the AGBC as an \u201cinterested person\u201d with terms to make sure doing so will not delay the hearing. A person or organization may be allowed to participate as an interested person if it is affected by the proceedings and can assist the Tribunal in making its decision.\nAs an administrative decision-making body, the Tribunal has a lot of flexibility to do creative and practical things to make the process more efficient while remaining fair.\nDecision Content\nThere is no document available for this decision.\n",

Context of the motion\n[1] This is a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the \u201cTribunal\u201d) ruling on a motion filed by the Complainant, Mr. Joshua Dorais (\u201cMr. Dorais\u201d), requesting the reopening of the inquiry to file additional evidence.\n[2] This additional evidence consists of 25 emails between Mr. Dorais and different bodies or officers of the Canadian Armed Forces (the \u201cRespondent\u201d or the \u201cForces\u201d) between September 4, 2012, and September 5, 2016. Mr. Dorais argued that these documents are relevant to the remedies that the Tribunal might order regarding his lost wages and job opportunities within the Forces.\n[3] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (the \u201cCommission\u201d) consented to Mr. Dorais\u2019s request and filed its representations on July 13, 2022, while the Forces, which filed its own representations on the same date, firmly objected to it. Mr. Dorais had the opportunity to file a reply, which he did on July 20, 2022.\n[4] It is important to note that, in this proceeding, the hearing is currently completed and the evidence of all the parties is now closed. To this effect, the Tribunal held its hearing over a period of 18 days, including two days completely reserved for the final arguments of the parties. This complex hearing was conducted over a long period, between April 6, 2021, and March 10, 2022.\n[5] It was only on June 29, 2022, when the Tribunal took its decision under deliberation, that the Complainant formally requested the reopening of the inquiry to file additional documents.\nII. Decision\n[6] On the following grounds, the Tribunal dismisses Mr. Dorais\u2019s motion.\nIII. Issues\n[7] To determine whether Mr. Dorais\u2019s additional evidence can be admitted in evidence when the inquiry is closed, the Tribunal must answer the following three quetions:\nWould the evidence, if presented, probably have changed the result of the inquiry on the complaint?\nCould the evidence have been obtained before the inquiry by the exercise of reasonable diligence?\nDo exceptional circumstances exist justifying the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to admit the additional evidence?\nIV. Legal bases\n[8] To be able to rule on the issue, the Tribunal must first establish the legal bases of a motion to reopen an inquiry to file additional evidence.\n[9] It must be conceded that neither the Canadian Human Rights Act (R.S.C. (1985), c. H-6) (\u201cCHRA\u201d), nor the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (2021), SOR\/2021-137 (\u201cthe Rules\u201d), nor the former Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (03-05-04) (the \u201cFormer Rules\u201d), contemplate the reopening of an inquiry in order to admit additional evidence once the evidence was declared closed.\n[10] Case law then becomes useful and relevant in the circumstances since it guides us on the legal approach to follow and the legal principles that are applicable in such circumstances.\n[11] To this effect, the Tribunal drew the attention of the parties to two decisions in the matter as a starting point, namely Micheline Montreuil v. The Canadian Forces, 2009 CHRT 15 [\u201cMontreuil\u201d] and 671122 Ontario Ltd. v. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 983 [\u201cSagaz\u201d].\n[12] In Montreuil, the Tribunal applied the analysis of the Supreme Court of Canada (the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d) in Sagaz, which confirmed the two-part test applied in Scott v. Cook, [1970] 2 OR 769. At para 20 of Sagaz, the Supreme Court confirmed the following two-part test:\n1) Would the evidence, if presented at trial, probably have changed the result?\n2) Could the evidence have been obtained before trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence?\n[13] We must make two distinctions between this instance and the Sagaz case; on the one hand, our proceeding concerns human rights and pertains to administrative law and, on the other hand, the Tribunal has not yet rendered its final decision, which has been under deliberation since March 2022. In Sagaz, however, the issue concerned a motion for reopening a trial in a criminal matter in which the judge had already rendered his final decision.\n[14] Nonetheless, Sagaz remains a key Supreme Court decision in the matter of reopening an inquiry. The Court\u2019s teachings are useful and relevant in the circumstances of our case and, as will be discussed later, this two-part analysis has been adapted by the various courts to correspond to cases like ours.\n[15] The Commission and the Forces drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to the decision rendered in Marshall v. Membertou First Nation, 2021 CHRT 36 [\u201cMarshall\u201d] by my fellow Member Raymond. More specifically, the Forces mainly base their reasoning on Member Raymond\u2019s analysis in that case. The Tribunal will address this question head on.\n[16] Two major points allow us to distinguish between Marshall, as in Sagaz, and our current proceeding. This greatly reduces the relevance and weight to attach to Marshall.\n[17] Firstly, Member Raymond questioned the reopening of the complainant\u2019s evidence when the presentation of the respondent\u2019s evidence had not yet begun. In other words, the record was not closed, and no final argument had been heard (Marshall at para 168). This instead meant reopening the complainant\u2019s evidence before the respondent began its own defence.\n[18] Secondly, the motion for reopening the inquiry was filed by the complainant in a very specific context. The motion was filed in response to a non-suit motion filed by the respondent. The Tribunal understands from Marshall that the complainant did not testify at all in his own complaint and, according to the Tribunal, was also underrepresented by his representative. Member Raymond then permitted the reopening of his evidence to remedy this situation before the respondent presented its own evidence (Marshall at para 176).\n[19] Therefore, the situation in Marshall is very different from ours; the Tribunal enjoyed greater leeway to reopen the complainant\u2019s evidence because the inquiry was not yet closed, and the respondent had not yet begun presenting its own evidence.\n[20] In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, the present situation is closer to that in Montreuil, in which the Member conducting the inquiry had also taken his decision under deliberation and had not yet rendered his final decision.\n[21] With due regard for the test applied by the Member conducting the inquiry in Marshall, it is my opinion that this is not the test to apply in the circumstances in which we find ourselves in the matter of Mr. Dorais. The test in Montreuil is the right test in our case, as endorsed by the Federal Court of Canada (\u201cFederal Court\u201d).\n[22] In 2011, the Federal Court once again addressed this question regarding the reopening of a trial after the presentation of the arguments but before the final judgment is rendered or the reasons are given (see Varco Canada Limited v. Pason Systems Corp., 2011 FC 467 (CanLII) [\u201cVarco\u201d]).\n[23] In Varco, the Federal Court was unequivocal in stating that the case law relating to the reopening of a trial after the reasons have been given (for example, in Sagaz) continues to be useful and to give us guidance.\n[24] The Honourable Justice Phelan wrote in paragraph 15 of Varco that:\nThe first point and an overarching aspect is that reopening is a matter of broad discretion but one which should be exercised sparingly and cautiously. Finality of a trial is a critical concept in our justice system \u2013 no one appreciates that concept more than a trial judge who is faced with the generally unpleasant task of reopening a case on which he or she has commenced writing.\n[25] In paragraph 17, the Federal Court continues its analysis by presenting this significant difference with Sagaz because, in Vasco, the Court had not yet rendered its final judgment. The same distinction was made by the Tribunal in the above paragraphs of this decision.\n[26] In so doing, the Honourable Justice Phelan reformulated the first question of the two-part test in Sagaz, which was \u201cwould the evidence, if presented at trial, probably have changed the result?\u201d He instead asks the following question: \u201ccould the evidence, if it had been presented, have had any influence on the result?\u201d According to the Federal Court, this question then requires an analysis of the materiality and relevance of the additional evidence concerned in the motion (Varco at para 17).\n[27] In addition to this modified two-part analysis, the Federal Court added another consideration, the existence of exceptional circumstances. On this subject, it states that decision makers may exercise their discretionary power to determine whether exceptional circumstances exist that justify setting aside the reasonable diligence criteria, which is provided in the second part of the analysis, or at least reducing its overall importance (Varco at para 20). The Federal Court adds that the danger that a court would be misled is an aspect of the exceptional circumstances\u2019 consideration.\n[28] Still in Varco, the Federal Court specifies in paragraph 21 that several factors, such as relevance, necessity, reliability, due diligence and prejudice, are part of the overall analysis made by the decision maker in the context of a motion for the reopening of an inquiry to admit additional evidence (the Federal Court based its decision on Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2009 FC 294).\n[29] The Honourable Justice Phelan wrote in paragraph 22 of Vasco that:\n[\u2026] when all of the various factors, tests and considerations are taken together, the importance of the integrity of the trial process \u2013 the search for the truth through evidence \u2013 is an overarching consideration. To some extent that consideration is addressed in the issue of whether a court would be misled.\n[30] Recently, the Honourable Justice Lafreni\u00e8re also addressed a motion for reopening a trial concerning the filing of new evidence after the evidence of the parties was closed, but before the arguments were presented (Rovi Guides, Inc. v. Videotron Ltd., 2021 FC 19 (CanLII) [\u201cRovi Guides\u201d] at para 16). Once again, the Federal Court adopted the Supreme Court\u2019s two-part analysis in Sagaz, which repeated the test in Scott, indicating that it was just as applicable in the circumstances before it.\n[31] In Rovi Guides, the Federal Court added that the public interest in the finality of litigation is an important consideration in the analysis of this type of motion, since reopening the inquiry has the potential to create an injustice (at para 18).\n[32] However, Justice Lafreni\u00e8re added that the failure of a party to exercise due diligence to obtain evidence before trial is not necessarily fatal; in cases where the interests of justice call for the admission of fresh evidence, the decision maker possesses a residual discretion to admit fresh evidence even if the two-part analysis is not met (Rovi Guides at para 27; see also Brace v. Canada, 2014 FCA 92 (CanLII) at para 12 [\u201cBrace\u201d]).\n[33] In Brace, the Honourable Justice Stratas warned that this residual discretion should only be exercised with great care and in the clearest of cases. Closer to us, in Montreuil, the Tribunal also reiterated this same idea: a tribunal or a court must exercise its discretion to reopen the inquiry sparingly and with the greatest care so that fraud and abuse of the tribunal\u2019s processes do not result (Montreuil at para 16).\n[34] Based on the teachings of the Supreme Court and the Federal Court, the test on the reopening of an inquiry to allow the filing of additional evidence before the final decision of the Tribunal is rendered is then stated as follows:\nWould the evidence, if presented, probably have changed the result of the inquiry on the complaint?\nCould the evidence have been obtained before the inquiry by the exercise of reasonable diligence?\nDo exceptional circumstances exist justifying the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to admit additional evidence?\n[35] Finally, all these elements fundamentally raise a question of prejudice. When the Tribunal must weigh the real benefits the additional evidence could procure, it must necessarily analyze the disadvantages that this could also create, in addition to considering one of the fundamental principles on which our judicial system is based, the finality of judicial proceedings. It is not simply a question of reopening the inquiry and granting the possibility of simply adding evidence after the proceedings have been declared closed. Nor is it about improving or completing the evidence already presented at the hearing.\n[36] Thus, the impacts involved in reopening the inquiry must be assessed, for example, having to recall witnesses or to schedule additional dates to hear the parties, the evidence, and the arguments. The time, costs and resources that will be necessary for both the parties and the Tribunal to complete these steps must also be considered.\n[37] Finally, the principles of natural justice include the right of a party to present complete and sufficient evidence in a timely manner. As a corollary, the principles of natural justice also call for the obligation not to take the opposing party by surprise once the die has been cast.\n[38] Keeping these legal principles in mind, the Tribunal will analyze this motion.\nV. Preliminary remarks\n[39] The Forces raised concerns about the fact that Mr. Dorais added to his motion the 25 emails concerned by his request to reopen the inquiry to file additional evidence without having been authorized to do so by the Tribunal. The Tribunal does not intend to linger on this argument.\n[40] On the one hand, in its analysis, the Tribunal must assess, in particular, the materiality and relevance of the documents concerned by the request. To do so, it must necessarily consult the documentation in question so that it can render its decision. If Mr. Dorais had not attached the emails concerned by the request, the Tribunal inevitably would have asked him to transmit them so that it could rule on the question and dispose of the motion.\n[41] On the other hand, the Forces ask the Tribunal to strike Mr. Dorais\u2019s affidavit in its entirety. The Forces consider that the affidavit is a way to provide the context and introduce new evidence concerning the emails for which Mr. Dorais requests the reopening of the inquiry to file them as evidence. However, the Forces base their own representations on this affidavit to defend themselves. It seems counterproductive for the Forces to request that an affidavit be struck, when they rely on this affidavit to defend themselves and produce a response.\n[42] Having said this, and contrary to what the Forces claim, the fact that Mr. Dorais filed an affidavit in which he refers to the 25 emails is certainly not a way to introduce evidence without authorization. The affidavit and the 25 emails in question are part of the notice of motion and the record of motion. The affidavit in no case constitutes evidence filed at the hearing and admitted by the Tribunal as such. The 25 emails can only constitute evidence if the Tribunal grants Mr. Dorais\u2019s motion and formally admits them as evidence (see, in particular, 50(3)(c) of the CHRA).\n[43] Finally, Mr. Dorais already testified on his experience of the recruiting process and the steps he took with different departments in the Forces during his application. If the Tribunal admits the emails in question, they will be assessed in light of Mr. Dorais\u2019s testimony at the hearing, subject to additional arguments and the necessity to recall witnesses.\nVI. Analysis\n[44] Mr. Dorais filed a motion to reopen the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry to file additional evidence when the inquiry had been declared closed. More specifically, Mr. Dorais wishes to file 25 emails between him and various bodies and officers of the Forces presented chronologically from September 4, 2012, to September 5, 2016. He believes that these documents will give the Tribunal more context regarding the filing of his application in the Forces. The Commission consents to his request, while the Forces oppose it.\n[45] As the Tribunal already noted in its instructions to the parties concerning Mr. Dorais\u2019s request, a request to reopen an inquiry to file additional evidence when the inquiry is closed is a rare and exceptional one, for which the Tribunal must exercise its discretion sparingly and with the greatest care (Montreuil at para 16).\nA. Would the evidence, if presented, probably have changed the result of the inquiry on the complaint?\n[46] Regarding the first part of the test, Mr. Dorais considers that the new documentary evidence is relevant and useful for the Tribunal because it highlights the context of the filing of his application in the Forces, his commitment, his efforts and his objectives to join this organization again. He believes that these new elements will exercise a significant influence on the result of the proceeding, among other reasons, because the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve had confirmed to him that a nursing position was available in 2015-2016.\n[47] Mr. Dorais alleges that the Forces raised doubts regarding the availability of such a position during his cross-examination at the hearing and in their final arguments. According to Mr. Dorais, he accidentally found the emails in his outbox, and not in his inbox, because he remembered having had interactions with Master Corporal Mason Mason in which they discussed the possibility that a nursing officer position was available for him. He adds that the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve would not have transferred his application to the recruiting centre if no position had been available for him. He claims that an applicant must check whether a position exists with the Forces Reserve Unit he wishes to join before embarking on the recruiting process.\n[48] In a similar vein, the Commission refers to the testimony of Ms. Eastwood who confirmed that there probably was a nursing officer position available.\n[49] Finally, Mr. Dorais considers that these emails are important because, during the hearing, the Tribunal heard evidence on the efforts he deployed to obtain a nursing officer position with the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve in 2015 and 2016 and the recruiting process both in the Primary Reserve and in the Regular Forces. According to Mr. Dorais, the 25 emails address all this in real time and could influence the Tribunal\u2019s decision on his claim for loss of employment and the related loss wages.\n[50] He adds that he does not remember that the Forces raised any problem during the case management process regarding the availability of a nursing officer position. He had no reason at that time to produce documents on this subject. According to his understanding, once the prima facie evidence was presented, which was his priority, the Forces then bore the burden of presenting \u201call other things\u201d, to use his own words.\n[51] The Commission agrees with Mr. Dorais. It considers that the documentary evidence is relevant because it makes it possible to support the position that a recruit must confirm, on the one hand, the existence of a position before his application is accepted and, on the other hand, the existence of a nursing officer position with the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve. These emails therefore support his claim for loss wages.\n[52] The Commission recalls that Mr. Dorais alleged that a nursing officer position was available with the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve. This having been said, the Forces argued that Mr. Dorais had not presented evidence on this subject and that he had chosen not to call someone from this Reserve to testify in this regard. The Commission therefore considers that these emails dispose of the question and that this additional evidence could affect the result of this matter.\n[53] The Forces claim that Mr. Dorais did not discharge his burden to prove that said documents are relevant and convincing. The Forces consider that the relevance of the additional evidence is unclear, in that the documents do not address the questions of discrimination or remedies. According to the Forces, nothing proves that Mr. Dorais would have received a job offer or a guarantee of employment or that the documents contain information concerning his rank, his salaries, a number of hours or other elements in this regard. Nor did he prove that the persons involved in Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruiting process are the authors of these emails. According to the Forces, Mr. Dorais only wishes to provide the context for his experience of the recruiting process, which he could not have done during his testimony in April 2021. In so doing, the Forces consider that the emails are not useful, that they are irrelevant to the dispute and that their admission would have no significant impact on the outcome of the case.\n[54] Firstly, Mr. Dorais argues in his motion that the additional documents he requests to file will offer the Tribunal the context of the submission of his application, highlighting his path, his commitment and his objectives to join the Forces again. The Tribunal notes that these are not reasons for which a reopening of an inquiry may be granted. It is exceptional to allow a party to file additional evidence once their evidence has been declared closed and the inquiry has been concluded. It is not about improving or completing his evidence with elements that are irrelevant or have no major impact that would probably change the result of the inquiry on the complaint.\n[55] The Tribunal consulted Mr. Dorais\u2019s documents, which it numbered from JB-168 to JB-192. A simple review of these documents shows, first and foremost, that certain emails are redundant and duplicate each other. Indeed, it must be added that the relevance and usefulness of the emails Mr. Dorais requests to file are questionable.\n[56] Nothing in what was consulted by the Tribunal in the documents listed as Exhibits JB-168 to JB-192 is a great surprise. Some documents concern email exchanges between Mr. Dorais and other officers within the Forces, in different departments, while he was attempting to discover whether a nursing position was available. Other exchanges are simply automated responses by the application filing system or follow-ups on the progress of his application within the Forces, which greatly diminishes their usefulness and relevance.\n[57] Moreover, it must be noted that Mr. Dorais already testified on the matter and was cross-examined on these aspects. Also, other witnesses, including Ms. Eastwood, provided their understanding of the question of whether an applicant must undertake preliminary steps to determine if a position is available before submitting his application.\n[58] This having been said, the reliability of the emails is not called into question. But it must be recognized that the evidence adduced at the hearing through the various testimonies already addressed this question in whole.\n[59] Therefore, in our case, this is not additional evidence that could probably change the result of the inquiry. Rather, Mr. Dorais attempts to support, with undisclosed additional evidence, the evidence that had already been submitted by testimony during the hearing.\n[60] The emails do not constitute documents that were unknown to everyone; the documents were identified by Mr. Dorais through his own mailbox. Instead, the documents only corroborate his own testimony adduced at the hearing.\n[61] In so doing, the Tribunal considers that the answer to the question \u201cwould the evidence, if presented, probably have changed the result of the inquiry on the complaint?\u201d is no.\nB. Could the evidence have been obtained before the inquiry by the exercise of reasonable diligence?\n[62] Mr. Dorais stated that this new evidence could not be obtained by the exercise of reasonable diligence before the hearings. To this effect, he states that it was on May 9, 2022, that he discovered the 25 emails in question dated between September 4, 2012, and September 5, 2016, when he was in his car consulting his mailbox to pass the time. He explained that he found this evidence while scrolling through his sent items and not his inbox.\n[63] Mr. Dorais stated that if he had been represented by counsel, this person could also have assisted him in preparing his case.\n[64] He also added that, when the Commission had made to the Forces a request for disclosure concerning the filing of his application, particularly the emails they might have had thereon, the Forces responded that these emails could not be produced. Instead, the Forces invited him to disclose such emails between him and the Forces\u2019 employees if he had access to them. Mr. Dorais considers that the Forces\u2019 efforts in the disclosure were as mediocre as his.\n[65] In the same vein, the Commission alleged that the Forces indeed did not disclose these emails between its employees and Mr. Dorais. Moreover, the paper version of Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitment file was destroyed by the Respondent in March 2020. To this effect, the Commission refers to the testimony of Ms. Eastwood, who explained that she did not receive a request to hold Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitment file in order to preserve the evidence due to the existence of a pending dispute. She confirmed that the file was destroyed by subordinates. However, the Commission specified that, as Ms. Eastwood indicated, in the former computer system, the policy would have been to print the emails and add them to the recruitment file.\n[66] The Forces argued that Mr. Dorais did not provide reasonable explanations concerning the significant delay in producing this evidence. Since Mr. Dorais mentioned that he found these emails on May 9, 2022, when he was scrolling through his emails on his phone to pass the time, the Forces then stated that he had control and possession of these documents at all revelant times to these proceedings.\n[67] The Forces add that, in April 2021, during the cross-examination of Mr. Dorais, he noticed that they raised doubts regarding the availability of a nursing officer position in their organization. In a letter dated June 23, 2021, the Forces had stated that the dispute would focus on the actions and decisions of the medical officer who made the decision regarding his recruitement and not on the application process of the recruitement centre itself. In this correspondence, the Forces had invited Mr. Dorais to file the emails he had in his possession between him and the organization\u2019s various employees that he considered relevant. The Forces believe that Mr. Dorais must thus have been advised to search through his emails to find exchanges regarding the recruitment process if he thought that these emails were relevant to the dispute. Contrary to Mr. Dorais\u2019s claims that their efforts to produce their employees\u2019 emails were mediocre, the Forces stated that they distributed the emails relevant to the dispute. They did not concede that the recruitement centre\u2019s emails were in fact relevant.\n[68] The Forces also argued that the Former Rules, which apply in this instance, provide that it is the right of all parties to an inquiry to have a full and ample opportunity to be heard; arguments and evidence must be disclosed and presented in a timely and efficient manner (Rule 1 of the Former Rules).\n[69] They add that subsection 50(1) of the CHRA provides that they had the right to receive a notice and be given a full and ample opportunity to appear, present evidence and make representations. Considering the delay caused by Mr. Dorais, the Forces argue that it would not be expeditious to allow him to use the process in this manner to file new evidence.\n[70] Moreover, although the Forces consider the emails in question not relevant or convincing, they allege that Mr. Dorais knew that he had the obligation, according to the Rules, to disclose the documents relevant to his dispute (Rules 6(1)(d),(4),(5) and 9(3) of the Former Rules). If Mr. Dorais believed that these documents were relevant, the Forces consider that he could have listed them on his list of documents and disclosed them. They add that Rule 9(3) of the Former Rules prevents a party from relying on undisclosed evidence. The only exception is if this meets the objectives set out in Rule 1(1) of the Former Rules and if this is authorized by the Tribunal, it will then offer the other parties the possibility of replying to it.\n[71] The Forces believe that Mr. Dorais did not show reasonable diligence and had full latitude to provide the documents he considered relevant. As such, during the July 2021 hearing, when he disclosed emails relating to the recruitment process, he should have searched through his mailbox diligently to find the 25 emails.\n[72] On this subject, the Forces draw the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Whyte, Kasha v. Canadian National Railway, 2010 CHRT 6 (CanLII) [Whyte], opining that the Tribunal, in that case, had dismissed the respondent\u2019s request to reopen the inquiry on the simple basis that the respondent had access to the information in question before and during the hearing and that it could have obtained it by showing reasonable diligence. They also refer to Canada (Human Rights Comm.) v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 18406 (CHRT), in which the Tribunal also dismissed the respondent\u2019s request to reopen the inquiry because the respondent could have obtained the evidence if it had acted with reasonable diligence. As in these cases, the Forces argue that the lack of reasonable diligence on Mr. Dorais\u2019s part should prevent the reopening of the inquiry.\n[73] In view of the parties\u2019 arguments, the Tribunal considers that, indeed, Mr. Dorais\u2019s additional documentary evidence could have been obtained well before the inquiry, or at least during the inquiry, if he had acted with reasonable diligence, because those emails were in his Outlook sent items or inbox.\n[74] The way the documents were found by Mr. Dorais\u2014while he was in his car, passing the time, scrolling through his emails in his Outlook mailbox\u2014supports the idea that the email exchanges between him and the various bodies and officers of the Forces were easily traceable and could have been disclosed well before the hearing, or at least during the hearing. For that reason, reasonable diligence could have enabled him to disclose this documentation to the other parties.\n[75] However, even if Mr. Dorais indicated that he had not really understood that the question regarding his previous search for a nursing position in the Forces was in dispute, he nonetheless was able to testify on this subject and inform the Tribunal of the steps he undertook. He was able to share his memories of his exchanges with various agents of the Forces and name them. Mr. Dorais had the opportunity during the hearing to file the documentation that pertained to his testimony, which he did not do.\n[76] In his representations, he shared his memory that, during his cross-examination, when he was answering questions about the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve, the question of emails concerning recruiting with the Reserve came up. Again, in his representations, Mr. Dorais also mentioned that, during his cross-examination, he thought that it might be too late to file certain documents that he had in his possession.\n[77] Mr. Dorais did not ask the Tribunal for authorization to file the emails in question concerning the preliminary steps he undertook with the recruitement centre and the Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance Primary Reserve. The only exhibits filed to this effect are JB-136 and JB-137, namely the exchanges with Ms. Mason of the recruitement centre.\n[78] This presupposes that Mr. Dorais remembered that emails were exchanged between him and various officers of the Forces. However, he does not explain why he did not take reasonable steps to search for and recover them in his own mailbox.\n[79] Nonetheless, he filed Exhibits JB-136 and JB-137. These two exhibits are email exchanges between him and Ms. Mason. These exhibits fall within the period when Mr. Dorais was trying to find out whether there was a nursing position available. However, he did not attach any of the other emails falling within the same relevant period.\n[80] The Tribunal is surprised that Mr. Dorais also included Exhibits JB-136 and JB-137 in this request to reopen the inquiry but marked them as Exhibits JB-189 and JB-190. However, the Tribunal finds that they are indeed the same emails as those that were filed at the hearing, under Exhibits JB-136 and JB-137.\n[81] The Tribunal wonders why Mr. Dorais did not distribute all of the emails between him, the Forces, its officers and the recruitment centre when he filed Exhibits JB-136 and JB-137. The Tribunal could have addressed such a request in due course, at the hearing.\n[82] Therefore, the evidence that Mr. Dorais requests to file is not new, and the Tribunal is not convinced that it involves documents whose existence Mr. Dorais had no knowledge. As the Tribunal has already explained, Mr. Dorais was a party to these conversations with the Forces and remembers these exchanges with the Forces, their officers and the recruitment centre. As mentioned, he already filed similar documents in the same relevant period. It was then his responsibility to conduct his research diligently and find the documents that supported his claims.\n[83] Regarding the argument that Mr. Dorais was not represented, it must be noted that, although not represented, Mr. Dorais was able to bring his case to a conclusion. The Tribunal understands very well that he was not represented by counsel in the proceedings and that the services of a lawyer or legal advisor are useful and desirable. However, this service is not accessible to everyone.\n[84] Nonetheless, we cannot claim that Mr. Dorais\u2019s representation by counsel would necessarily have led to the discovery, distribution or filing of the emails in question in the record of the Tribunal. The presence of a lawyer and what could have then occurred remain speculative.\n[85] Moreover, the Tribunal notes that, throughout the proceedings, Mr. Dorais had shown that he was able to understand the Tribunal\u2019s procedures and the obligations he had to meet; this includes notably the disclosure of the documents that were arguably relevant to the case.\n[86] He was able to produce his statements of particulars, disclose the documents arguably relevant to his dispute, create his list of exhibits for the hearing, summon his witnesses, etc. Although not represented and without legal training, Mr. Dorais showed the necessary and appropriate skills and abilities to develop a general understanding of his rights and obligations in our quasi-judicial process.\n[87] It must also be mentioned that the Commission participated in the hearing. Although it did not represent Mr. Dorais, the Commission supported him throughout the proceedings, a consideration that should not be ignored.\n[88] The Tribunal must support unrepresented parties in proceedings so that they understand what they must accomplish and are able to present their case meaningfully (subsection 50(1) of the CHRA; see also Canadian Judicial Council, Statement of Principles on Self-Represented Litigants and Accused Persons, CJC 2006, at https:\/\/cjc-ccm.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/2020\/Final-Statement-of-Principles-SRL.pdf, upheld by the Supreme Court in Pintea v. Johns, 2017 SCC 23).\n[89] However, not being represented does not give carte blanche to a lighter onus or burden of proof for the party without a lawyer or legal advisor, to the detriment of the burden that must be met by the opposing parties, either. This would necessarily create unfairness in the proceeding if it were the case.\n[90] Here, Mr. Dorais\u2019s documents were in his possession and easily accessible with a simple search through his emails. It also seems that he was aware that emails might exist; he filed some emails between him and Ms. Masson under Exhibits JB-136 and JB-137, which are repeated in Exhibits JB-188 and JB-189 relating to this motion. These documents could have been distributed prior to or, at least, during the hearing (Whyte, supra). It was Mr. Dorais\u2019s responsibility to conduct his research in advance with sufficient diligence and to share the documents that were arguably relevant to the case. Therefore, the Tribunal holds that the second part of the test is not fulfilled.\n[91] The question at this stage is whether the person requesting the filing of evidence after both the evidence and the inquiry are closed acted with reasonable diligence to obtain the evidence. Mr. Dorais bore the burden of convincing the Tribunal that he acted with reasonable diligence to obtain said evidence, which he failed to prove.\n[92] The question of the destruction of Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitment file, raised by the Commission, will be addressed in the exceptional circumstances section below because the Tribunal considers that this is where the analysis of this point is most suitable.\nC. Do exceptional circumstances exist justifying the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to admit the additional evidence?\n[93] The Commission considers that the Tribunal has the residual discretion to reopen the inquiry, even if it concluded that the reasonable diligence test was not met. It believes that the fact that a government organization does not preserve the evidence well after the dispute began constitutes exceptional circumstances justifying the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to reopen the inquiry.\n[94] The Commission believes that the Forces failed in their diligence to preserve the hard copy of Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitement file. It stated that, as Ms. Eastwood confirmed, the emails would have been placed in Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitement record. These emails might also have been found in the mailboxes of the employees in question, but the Forces did not present evidence that its employees had been contacted to check whether they had access to these emails.\n[95] The Commission adds that there will be no prejudice for the Forces if these emails are admitted because they should have been in their possession. It believes that, in so doing, the integrity of the inquiry is maintained, the additional delay is mitigated and, in circumstances where the final decision has not been rendered yet, the interests of justice and procedural fairness regarding the reopening of the inquiry take precedence over the principle of finality.\n[96] The Forces alleged that the reopening of the inquiry to file new evidence will create additional costs and delays. They added that, in the normal course of proceedings, the parties would have had the opportunity to present arguments to reply to the evidence filed. If this opportunity was afforded, the probative value of Mr. Dorais\u2019s documents must be assessed.\n[97] The Forces added that they will suffer prejudice with the admission of these documents because their defence of record was based on the presentation of the details by Mr. Dorais, the documents disclosed, and the testimony presented. The Forces argued that unless Mr. Dorais can prove relevance, the compelling effect of the documents and their probative value, it would be contrary to the interests of justice to admit them as evidence after the conclusion of the inquiry. Finally, they argued that, in light of the opposing factors, which are significant, the truth-seeking principle does not require the admission of this evidence to confirm other evidence.\n[98] In the case at bar, do exceptional circumstances exist justifying the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretionary power to admit additional evidence even though the inquiry is closed? The Tribunal answers in the negative.\n[99] Considering that the documents in question would probably not change the result of the inquiry, that their materiality and relevance are doubtful, and that Mr. Dorais could have easily had access to them by consulting his Outlook mailbox, the Tribunal does not believe that the circumstances justify that it uses its discretion to admit the additional documents.\n[100] Indeed, the fact that Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitment file was destroyed in a precarious manner by agents of the Forces when a dispute was in progress or anticipated is insufficient, in the case at bar, to justify that the Tribunal use its discretion to admit these documents.\n[101] The Tribunal notes that good faith is presumed in law (Robinson v. Canadian Armed Forces, 1991-07-04, T.D. 9\/91, at p. 19; Nur v. Canadian National Railway Company, 2019 CHRT 5 at para 139; Valenti v. Canadian Pacific Railway, 2017 CHRT 25, para 26 (table); Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71).\n[102] It is incumbent on the party that raises the bad faith of another party to prove its existence. Nothing in the evidence, nor in the representations of the Commission or of Mr. Dorais, convinces the Tribunal that the Forces, or its officers, destroyed Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitment file intentionally or in bad faith, or by showing gross negligence.\n[103] Ms. Eastwood came to testify openly before the Tribunal on the destruction of the file and explained the circumstances leading to its destruction. She indeed recognized that this should not have occurred and that gaps exist in the file retention procedure in the event of a dispute. Ms. Eastwood admitted that there were lessons to be learned from the situation and that corrections are necessary.\n[104] Even though Mr. Dorais\u2019s recruitment file\u2014which potentially could have included the emails in question\u2014was indeed destroyed, the emails nonetheless were in Mr. Dorais\u2019s possession well before the beginning of the Tribunal proceedings. As previously explained, these documents were easily traceable and accessible to Mr. Dorais with a simple search through his mailbox.\n[105] Regarding prejudice, the Tribunal notes that granting a request to add evidence after an inquiry was declared closed is an exceptional measure. It is not just a question of adding evidence after the fact, once the die has been cast, without any other formality. It is in the interests of justice and the sound administration of our judicial systems that, once the inquiry is declared closed, the courts and the tribunals may take the record under deliberation and render a decision with the evidence filed at the hearing. This respects the finality principle (Varco at para 15). The reopening of an inquiry is inherently a breach of these principles, and the Tribunal must be very cautious and only grant this type of request in rare and clear cases.\n[106] In the present case, truth seeking does not trump the principle of finality of judicial proceedings, considering the prejudice in terms of the time and costs that will be caused by the reopening of the inquiry, that the importance and relevance of the documents are doubtful, that the documents would probably not change the outcome of the inquiry and that Mr. Dorais could easily have had access to them by acting with reasonable diligence.\nVII.

Lustig\nI. CONTEXT\n[1] This is a ruling on a motion brought by the Respondent on November 17, 2022, for an order dismissing the complaint in this matter for delay, pursuant to rules 9 and 26 of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Rules of Procedure (the \"Rules\"). The sole issue in this case is whether the complaint should be dismissed for delay by the Complainant.\n[2] The Complainant identifies as a transgender Indigenous woman. Her complaint was filed on August 9, 2017, and alleges that the Respondent discriminated against her under sections 5 and 14.1 of the Canadian Human Rights Act (the \"Act\"). She alleges she experienced adverse differential treatment based on her race, gender identity or expression and retaliation for a previous human rights complaint filed with the Commission in 2014 and settled in January of 2017. In particular, she alleges that she was the subject on May 26, 2017, of an incident involving the excessive use of force against her and being forced to shower naked in front of several men and two women.\n[3] She is incarcerated at La Macaza Institution and has not been represented by counsel, but rather, acts with the assistance of her partner Noel McCallum who is also incarcerated there.\n[4] A Statement of Particulars (\"SOP\") was filed by the Complainant on June 28, 2021, as directed by the Tribunal. In her SOP the Complainant stated that her SOP was incomplete and requested to enter further lists of documents in her possession that she claimed were arguably relevant and not privileged. The SOP included allegations of a continuum of harassing and retaliatory incidents subsequent to the May 26, 2017, incident and to the filing of the complaint, including alleged incidents involving abusive actions taken against both the Complainant and Mr. McCallum by officers. Some of these incidents are described in the SOP as \"tortuous and criminal\".\n[5] In response to her request, the Tribunal on June 22, 2021, agreed to an extended time limit of August 16, 2021, to file her further SOP information. Thereafter on 5 additional subsequent occasions the Tribunal extended the time limit for filing an amended SOP in response to requests from the Complainant as follows: on August 10, 2021 until November 15, 2021; on November 29, 2021 until January 10, 2022; on March 28, 2022 until July 28, 2022; on August 2, 2022 until September 30, 2022 noting that \"a further extension might not be allowed\". None of these extensions resulted in the amended SOP being filed by the Complainant despite the Tribunal explaining to the parties that until the SOP was complete the case could not proceed as the Respondent needed to have a complete SOP to respond to and to determine whether to seek an order to strike allegations beyond the scope of the complaint.\n[6] Throughout this period of time, while not opposing the extensions mentioned above, the Respondent complained about the potential increased scope of the complaint being sought and of the negative impact of the delay to the case caused by the Complainant by not filing on time. It has taken issue with Mr. McCallum's proposed role as a representative as well as a witness for the Complainant. It has disputed the claims made by the Complainant that her delay in obtaining the information requested and filing on time was due to lack of access to and time on the institution's computers. It has provided information showing ample time available to the Complainant but unused by her to access and use the computers for these purposes and has provided additional opportunities unused by the Complainant for access to and use of the computers over the normal procedure. The Respondent has also complained that on numerous occasions the Complainant has not copied or advised the Respondent of her requests for extensions of time limits for filing and of not responding to correspondence from the Respondent including offers to assist the Complainant to obtain documents she allegedly needed to complete her SOP.\n[7] A further verbal request from Mr. McCallum was received by the Tribunal on September 22, 2022, for another extension until January 2023 again citing lack of available computer time as the reason for the request. This request was opposed by the Respondent. The Commission wrote that an extension \"for two weeks was reasonable\". The Tribunal granted an extension until October 14, 2022, and advised that the Tribunal \"expects that no further extensions will be granted\". On October 14, 2022, Mr. McCallum contacted the Tribunal's Registry to advise that the October 14th date would not be complied with and that further time into 2023 was required. He was instructed to provide a request in writing stating reasons for the request but to date has failed to do so.\n[8] Following the Respondent's commencement of this motion, the Tribunal issued directions on November 25, 2022, to the parties respecting a schedule for the Complainant and the Commission to respond to the motion by January 16, 2023 By correspondence dated December 20 and 29, 2022 the Complainant wrote to the Tribunal acknowledging the January 16, 2023, date for filing a response to the motion and stated that \"there will be no delay of us developing the January 16th\/2023 Statement of Position that has been call upon us\". (sic) To date the Complainant has not responded to the motion or filed an amended SOP or been in touch with the Tribunal since her last correspondence. The Commission filed responding submissions to the motion on January 13, 2023.\nII. DECISION\n[9] As the Complainant has shown a wholesale disregard for the Tribunal's time limits, the complaint should be dismissed.\nRESPONDENT'S SUBMISSIONS [10] The Respondent submits that it is in the interests of justice, after more than 18 months of extensions without the Complainant complying with time limits for filing her amended SOP, that the complaint be dismissed by the Tribunal for delay. The Tribunal has the authority to control its process and must guard against abuse and ensure that parties to its proceedings respect its deadlines (see Chisholm v. Halifax Employers Association, 2019 CHRT 38 at para. 15 (\"Chisholm\").\n[11] The Respondent cites section 48.9(1) of the Act that says that Tribunal proceedings should be conducted as expeditiously as the requirements of natural justice and the rules of procedure allow. It also cites Rules 9 and 10 of the Rules that say that the Tribunal may dismiss a complaint for non-compliance with a time limit under the Rules or make any order it considers necessary against abuse of process, on its own initiative or on the motion of a party.\n[12] The Respondent argues that it has met the two applicable legal tests (the \"classic test\" and the \"Seitz test\") for succeeding with its motion to dismiss the complaint for delay, even though it only needs to meet one of the tests to succeed. In this regard it cites Chisholm, supra at paragraphs 17, 18 and 19.\n[13] Under the \"classic test\" the Respondent argues that a) 18 months is an inordinate delay; b) the delay is inexcusable as the Complainant had more than sufficient time to prepare and file its amended SOP with the computer time provided and has not provided reasonable explanations for her delay in doing so; and c) the Respondent is likely to be prejudiced in presenting the best available evidence at a hearing before the Tribunal as the delay of now over 6 years since the incident that gave rise to the complaint will deprive the Tribunal of the opportunity to hear witnesses while their memories are still fresh, thereby compromising trial fairness.\n[14] Under the approach set out in Seitz v. Canada, 2002 FCT 456 (CanLII) at paras. 16-18 the Respondent argues that a) the Complainant has shown \"wholesale disregard\" for the Tribunal's time limits over 18 months including 6 extensions without an explanation; b) the Complainant does not appear to have any real intent to bring the case to a conclusion, but rather, has drawn-out the proceedings indefinitely; and c) the impact of the delay creates an abuse to the administration of justice for the reasons mentioned above.\n[15] The Respondent argues that this case is comparable to Labelle v. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 CHRT 4 at paras. 81-83, in which the Tribunal dismissed a complaint for delay on the basis that it had already granted the complainant numerous extensions of time and she failed to provide a reasonable explanation for her failure to comply with disclosure and filing obligations.\nCOMMISSION\u2019S SUBMISSIONS [16] The Commission submits that it is not in the public interest to dismiss the whole complaint for the delay by the Complainant in filing an amended SOP since the Complainant filed an SOP on time and the amended SOP is of limited purpose involving events after the incident in May 26, 2017 that gave rise to the complaint; because it would be prejudicial to the Complainant to dismiss the whole complaint leaving her without remedy for her complaint; and because it is unlikely that the Respondent will be prejudiced by the delay at this stage.\n[17] The Commission argues that dismissing complaints is a severe remedy that must be exercised with caution as an abuse of process due to administrative delay is a question of procedural fairness that must be assessed as part of the three-part test (see Law Society of Saskatchewan v. Abrametz, 2022 SCC 29 at para. 38 and Blencoe v. British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44 at paras. 115 and 122).\n[18] In applying the 2 applicable legal tests referred to in Chisholm to the present case of delay, the Commission submits that neither test is met when all factors are assessed, weighed and balanced given the severity of the remedy and the need to be cautious especially in a case involving an unrepresented complainant. Among the factors to be weighed in favor of not dismissing the complaint are the status of the Complainant as an unrepresented incarcerated inmate subject to various restrictions; the fact that she filed a SOP and the extension requests involved additional points about events after the event giving rise to her complaint; the prejudice that the Complainant would face by dismissing the whole complaint leaving her without remedy compared to the lack of evidence of prejudice to the Respondent; and the fact that the Respondent did not object to the first 5 extensions.\n[19] Instead of dismissing the whole complaint, the Commission suggests the Tribunal could set dates for the Respondent to file its statement of particulars in response to the Complainant's SOP and proceed to a hearing without the Complainant being permitted to raise any issue which was not clearly stipulated in her SOP.\nIII. ANALYSIS\n[20] I agree that the Tribunal is the \"master of its own process\" and that it has the discretion to manage its resources as it considers appropriate. I also agree that I have to be cautious in dismissing the complaint for the reasons cited by Commission and only after fully assessing the relevant factors and considering fairness together with expeditiousness.\n[21] In doing so, I am mindful of the fact that the Tribunal and the parties have been extremely accommodative to the requests for extensions of the Complainant for over 18 months despite the fact that, in my view, there was ample opportunity to file the amended SOP within the time limits allowed and the excuses given about computer time are not reasonable or credible. In this regard, I accept the Respondent\u2019s uncontradicted evidence about the Complainant\u2019s ample, available but unused access to use the computers to prepare her amended SOP as referred to in paragraph 6 above.\n[22] The Commission suggested the last extension date of October 14, 2022 was reasonable as opposed to the Complainant's request to extend the time limit into 2023. Despite 6 extensions granted together with warnings on the last 2 extensions that they would be the last, the Complainant has shown a wholesale disregard for the Tribunal's time limits and rules and caused the case to remain static for an unreasonable period of time with no apparent intent to bring the case to a conclusion. This is borne out by the fact that to date not only has the Complainant failed to file the amended SOP, despite 6 extensions for over 18 months, but she didn't even file a response to the motion as she had promised she would. We have no idea of whether she even agrees with the Commission's suggestion in paragraph 19 above.\n[23] This demonstrates a lack of respect by the Complainant for the Tribunal, the other parties and the process amounting to an abuse to the administration of justice and of the process, separate and apart from any prejudice caused by the inordinate and inexcusable delay.\n[24] As such, in assessing the facts in this case, I am of the view that it fits within the Seitz approach and that the motion should be allowed and the complaint dismissed.\nIV.

RULING [1] The Complainant Rae-Lynne Dicks alleges she was sexually harassed during her employment at a towing company (\u201cCompany\u201d) by the Respondent, James Randall, contrary to s. 14 of the Canadian Human Rights Act RSC, 1985, c.H-6 (\u201cCHRA\u201d).\n[2] For reasons that follow, I find that Ms. Dicks was sexually harassed by Mr. Randall contrary to the CHRA and order remedies.\nII. MS. DICKS IS A CREDIBLE WITNESS [3] I heard evidence from two witnesses during the course of the hearing: Ms. Dicks, and her treating psychologist, Dr. Jeff Morley.\n[4] Ms. Dicks had previously named the Company as a respondent in her complaint, along with the respondent James Randall. In October 2020, Ms. Dicks settled her complaint with the Company and this hearing proceeded against Mr. Randall as the sole respondent.\n[5] Neither the Canadian Human Rights Commission nor Mr. Randall attended or otherwise participated in the hearing despite being provided notice and opportunity to do so by the Tribunal.\n[6] I can accept some, all, or none of a witness\u2019 evidence depending, in part, on their credibility.\n[7] In Faryna v. Chorny 1951 CanLII 252 (BCCA), the British Columbia Court of Appeal described the approach that should be taken to assess credibility:\n\u2026Opportunities for knowledge, powers of observation, judgment and memory, ability to describe clearly what he has seen and heard, as well as other factors combine to produce what is called credibility.\nThe credibility of interested witnesses, particularly in cases of conflict of evidence cannot be gauged solely by the test of whether the personal demeanor of the particular witness carried conviction of the truth. The test must reasonably subject his story to an examination of its consistency with the probabilities that surround the currently existing conditions. In short, the real test of the truth of the story of the witness in such a case must be in harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions (\u2026) Again a witness may testify to what he sincerely believes to be true, but he may honestly be mistaken. (pg. 356-357)\n[8] On considering the factors set out in Faryna, I found Ms. Dicks to be a credible witness. Her evidence was reasonable, believable, and internally consistent. Further, it was not subject to challenge given Mr. Randall\u2019s failure to participate in the hearing, and there was nothing in the evidentiary record that contradicted her narrative.\n[9] As a result, I accepted Ms. Dicks\u2019 evidence in its entirety, and it is to this evidence that I now turn.\nIII. MS. DICKS\u2019 EVIDENCE [10] Ms. Dicks is a 55-year-old woman who, prior to working for the Company in Surrey, British Columbia, was a 911 operator and dispatcher. She was diagnosed with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) as a result of her years of 911 service and is prone to anxiety and depression as a result.\n[11] Ms. Dicks worked at the Company, which provided towing services, for about three months from October 20, 2017 to January 15, 2018. She was a billing clerk and Mr. Randall was a senior dispatcher to whom Ms. Dicks reported when he was on duty.\n[12] Ms. Dicks regularly worked with Mr. Randall while at the Company. Mr. Randall would routinely state to her that, given his seniority in the Company, he had the General Manager\u2019s confidence and support and could do whatever he wished and not get fired. Ms. Dicks says these statements made her feel uncomfortable and concerned about her job stability.\n[13] On the evening of November 26, 2017, Ms. Dicks began a 12-hour shift with Mr. Randall. They were working alone, except for when tow-truck drivers would come into the office to drop off paperwork.\n[14] During that shift, Mr. Randall stood at the front counter, blocked Ms. Dicks\u2019 access to the vehicle records book, and waited for her to move closer to him to make entries in the book. He was humming and making dancing movements.\n[15] Ms. Dicks asked Mr. Randall to move to allow her access to the books. At that point, Mr. Randall prevented her access and attempted to do a \u201chip-bump\u201d dance with her. Ms. Dicks attempted to physically avoid contact with Mr. Randall to make him stop dancing and asked him to move again.\n[16] Mr. Randall eventually moved and said something to the effect of, \u201chey, I really need to go get stupidly drunk, want to go do that with me after work at my place\u201d. Ms. Dicks responded that she didn\u2019t drink and avoided making eye contact and continued to enter information into the books. Mr. Randall responded by saying something to the effect of, \u201cthat\u2019s OK, you can hang out and look after me while I get drunk. I am a fun drunk\u201d.\n[17] Ms. Dicks says it was clear to her that Mr. Randall wanted \u201cdrunk sex\u201d with her because of the \u201csuggestive grin\u201d on his face and because of his hip gyrations which were sexual in nature. Ms. Dicks responded, \u201cI don't look after drunks\u201d and then ignored Mr. Randall. Ms. Dicks says she wanted to flee but couldn\u2019t move. She was scared about what he would do because they were alone.\n[18] Two times shortly after this incident, Mr. Randall made similar statements to Ms. Dicks without warning and in what Ms. Dicks described as a \u201csuggestive voice\u201d. Specifically, Mr. Randall stated \u201cyou know what I want\u201d with a physical gyration as he walked past Ms. Dicks. Ms. Dicks says these incidents caused her to be fearful, insecure, and to feel like a \u201ctarget\u201d.\n[19] On about two dozen other instances, Mr. Randall would make a point of touching Ms. Dicks\u2019 shoulder, neck, or the top of her chest without her consent and on pretexts including removing a stray hair. He would often laugh as Ms. Dicks recoiled or lurched away from the touch.\n[20] Ms. Dicks says that these repeated actions suggested to her that Mr. Randall had no respect for her personal space and could touch her whenever he wanted without her consent and despite her actively resisting the touch. Ms. Dicks says she felt \u201csmall, insignificant, and helpless\u201d.\n[21] Between about mid-November to mid-December 2017, when Ms. Dicks would ask Mr. Randall a question about billing or the computer system, Mr. Randall would lean on her shoulder with his chest and place his hand on top of her hand to move the mouse. Ms. Dicks estimated that this occurred about a dozen times and made her feel very uncomfortable.\n[22] The first time it happened, Mr. Randall stated, \u201cthis could be cozy\u201d. Each time, Mr. Randall would tell Ms. Dicks to \u201crelax\u201d, that he wasn\u2019t attacking her, or that they were \u201call adults\u201d, and they should be able to \u201ctalk about sex and our ex\u201d.\n[23] Ms. Dicks estimates that about six times between October and December 2017, tow-truck drivers would ask Ms. Dicks if she was \u201clooking for a good man\u201d. Ms. Dicks says that she believed Mr. Randall asked the drivers to make these inquiries because they only occurred when she was alone on shift with Mr. Randall and Mr. Randall was nearby and could hear the conversation. In response to the last inquiry in late December, Ms. Dicks stated loudly so that Mr. Randall could hear that she did not date coworkers and was \u201cnot looking for a man, so stop asking me\u201d.\n[24] Ms. Dicks says that after this incident in late December, Mr. Randall\u2019s \u201ctactics changed\u201d and that when she would have subsequent conversations with a driver of a personal nature in the presence of Mr. Randall, he would interject and say things like \u201cRae-Lynne doesn\u2019t date her co-workers you know\u201d. From that point onwards, Mr. Randall stopped providing positive feedback on Ms. Dicks\u2019 work.\n[25] Ms. Dicks testified that \u201cthis made me feel very defensive, as if I had no value as a work partner because I refused to date [Mr. Randall] or have sex with him after work. My skills at work were no longer of value. I wasn\u2019t a team player\u2026 solely because I refused to date him\u201d.\n[26] In mid-January 2018, Ms. Dicks was speaking with a driver who, along with 2 other drivers, had offered to assist her with moving furniture because she was moving from her apartment at the end of the month. Mr. Randall heard this conversation and interjected to invite himself. Mr. Randall said something to the effect of, \u201chey that sounds like fun. I would like to help. I live just three blocks away and can wander over with my six pack of beer. I mean I can\u2019t actually help lift or carry anything, but I can be the entertainment\u201d.\n[27] Ms. Dicks firmly declined the invitation, but says Mr. Randall continued to demand an invitation. Ms. Dicks says she was fearful after this interaction because Mr. Randall stated he lived three blocks away from her apartment which meant he knew where she lived. Ms. Dicks stated she did not know how Mr. Randall knew where she lived and she did not want him to show up unannounced to her apartment on the day of the move or otherwise.\n[28] From about January 2 to 14, 2018, once Ms. Dicks rebuffed Mr. Randall\u2019s advances on a regular basis in front of others, Ms. Dicks says Mr. Randall advised the Company manager that she was not able to competently perform her duties, despite Ms. Dicks receiving positing work evaluations prior to then. As a result, Mr. Randall was given an extra-hour each shift to double-check Ms. Dicks\u2019 work and would harass and interrupt her, making it difficult for her to complete her work.\n[29] On January 14, 2018 (Ms. Dicks\u2019 second to last day with the Company), Mr. Randall approached Ms. Dicks and talked about his relationships with women. He then asked Ms. Dicks if she ever had a \u201cone-night stand\u201d. Ms. Dicks says she wanted to end the conversation and responded along the lines of, \u201cI am a grown woman and I don\u2019t kiss and tell\u201d to which Mr. Randall responded with something to the effect of, \u201cthat means that you have\u2026 tell me about it\u2026 where did you find him\u2026was he good in bed\u201d.\n[30] Ms. Dicks says she felt uncomfortable with this interaction and was relieved when a driver arrived at the office and she could avoid any further discussion with Mr. Randall.\n[31] On January 15, 2018, Ms. Dicks says she was fired from the Company. She testified that she could not divulge the circumstances surrounding the termination given the confidentiality provisions of her settlement agreement with the Company.\n[32] Regarding the impact of Mr. Randall\u2019s harassment, Ms. Dicks says that, given her role as a former 911 operator and dispatcher living with chronic PTSD from her years of service, she was in a particularly vulnerable position and Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct had a significant impact on her.\n[33] Ms. Dicks says working with Mr. Randall:\nmade me nervous, increased my anxiety and made me doubt my professional abilities. It knocked my confidence out from under me and affected my ability to sleep and ability to perform at work to the best of my abilities. I felt that because I am a single woman that I was fair game and if I did not cooperate then I would suffer the consequences. Over the course of my employment my ability to cope, sleep, perform self-care, and maintain a professional equilibrium while at work were all negatively affected. I began having to make frequent appointments with my doctor, began having to use sleep medication on a nightly basis.\n[34] After leaving the Company, Ms. Dick says:\nI fell apart and suffered from a major depressive episode like I haven\u2019t experience in many years. Depression, anxiety, anger, shame, guilt, and serious lack of self-esteem caused me to be incapable of even basic self-care. Despite knowing that this was not my fault I reverted to punishing myself via lack of self-care. I had done this for many years and I hated myself for it. For the rest of January, and all of February to March, I was non-functional. Not eating properly, not sleeping without medication and suffering from insomnia. It got bad enough to even concern my doctor who then convinced me to begin taking anti-depressants again.\n[35] Ms. Dicks says she relocated to Grand Forks, British Columbia in April 2019 to be closer to family, in part because of her negative experience with Mr. Randall.\n[36] Ms. Dicks called her treating psychologist Dr. Jeff Morley to testify as an expert witness. Dr. Morley testified that he completed a Ph.D in counselling psychology from the University of British Columbia and had been a registered psychologist with the College of Psychologists of British Columbia since 2004. He testified that he is a board-certified expert in traumatic stress with the American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress. Given his qualifications, I accepted Dr. Morley as an expert witness in the field of psychology.\n[37] Dr. Morley testified very briefly that he conducted a psychological assessment of Ms. Dicks in February 2013 and diagnosed her with Chronic PTSD and a Major Depressive Disorder. He stated that Ms. Dicks has \u201cchecked in with me periodically throughout the years\u201d and the symptoms of her disorders, including anxiety and depression, have remained to the present day. Other than confirming his 2013 diagnosis and stating that the symptoms have remained, Dr. Morley did not provide any other material evidence.\nIV. SEXUAL HARASSMENT \u2013 LEGAL TEST [38] It is a discriminatory practice to harass someone on a prohibited ground of discrimination in the course of their employment, and sexual harassment is deemed to be harassment on a prohibited ground: CHRA s. 14.\n[39] The Supreme Court of Canada, in Janzen v. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1252 at 1284, described sexual harassment as follows:\nWithout seeking to provide an exhaustive definition of the term, I am of the view that sexual harassment in the workplace may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that detrimentally affects the work environment or leads to adverse job-related consequences for the victims of the harassment. [\u2026] Sexual harassment is a demeaning practice, one that constitutes a profound affront to the dignity of the employees forced to endure it. By requiring an employee to contend with unwelcome sexual actions or explicit sexual demands, sexual harassment in the workplace attacks the dignity and self-respect of the victim both as an employee and as a human being.\n[40] The Federal Court expanded on the reasoning in Janzen in Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Armed Forces), [1999] 3 FC 653. The Court held that, for a sexual harassment allegation to be substantiated, the following must be established:\n(1) The acts that form the basis of the complaint must be unwelcome, or ought to have been known by a reasonable person to be unwelcome;\n(2) The conduct must be sexual in nature; and\n(3) Ordinarily, sexual harassment requires a degree of persistence or repetition, but in certain circumstances even a single incident may be severe enough to be detrimental to the work environment.\nV. MR. RANDALL\u2019S CONDUCT CONSTITUTES SEXUAL HARASSMENT\n[41] I am satisfied that Ms. Dicks has proven, on a balance of probabilities, the essential elements of the test for sexual harassment set by the Federal Court.\n[42] I find that Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct towards Ms. Dicks between October 2017 and January 2018, which included unwanted touching, suggestive remarks, physical gyrations, solicitation of sexual history, invitations to go on dates, invitations to get drunk together, and invitations to come to his residence constituted conduct that was clearly sexual in nature.\n[43] I find that Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct was unwelcomed by Ms. Dicks or reasonably ought to have been known by Mr. Randall to be unwelcomed. Ms. Dicks clearly and repeatedly expressed her view to Mr. Randall that she was not interested in pursuing any conversation, physical interaction, or relationship with Mr. Randall that was sexual in nature.\n[44] I also find that Mr. Randall persisted with inappropriate sexual conduct over the course of several months and this conduct detrimentally affected Ms. Dicks\u2019 workplace environment. Ms. Dicks has stated, and I accept, that Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct made her feel anxious and afraid and adversely impacted her confidence and ability to perform her job duties.\n[45] Accordingly, based on Ms. Dicks\u2019 evidence which I have accepted in its entirety, and the legal test I must apply, I find that Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct constitutes sexual harassment contrary to s. 14 of the CHRA.\n[46] Having found a breach of the CHRA, I turn next to the issue of remedies.\nVI. REMEDY\nPain and suffering\n[47] Ms. Dicks claims $10,000 in damages against Mr. Randall for pain and suffering.\n[48] The Tribunal may compensate someone for pain and suffering they experienced as a result of a discriminatory practice by an amount not exceeding $20,000: CHRA s. 53(2)(e). However, the Tribunal tends to reserve the maximum amount of $20,000 for the most egregious of circumstances where the extent and duration of the circumstances warrant it: Grant v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 CHRT 10 at para. 115; Alizadeh-Ebadi v. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2017 CHRT 36 at 213.\n[49] In order to determine a reasonable amount for pain and suffering, the Tribunal must assess the consequences to the victim including, \u201cemotional consequences, frustration, disappointment, loss of self-esteem and self-confidence, grief, emotional well-being, stress, anxiety and sometimes even depression, suicidal thoughts and other psychological symptoms resulting from the discriminatory practice\u201d: Youmbi Eken v. Netrium Networks Inc., 2019 CHRT 44 at para. 71.\n[50] While medical evidence may be helpful in establishing these damages, it is not necessarily required: McFee v. Canadian Pacific Railway Company, 2019 CHRT 28 at para. 135.\n[51] In this case, the duration of Mr. Randall\u2019s harassment of Ms. Dicks was short and spanned less than three months. However, the impact on Ms. Dicks was significant, particularly given her vulnerability associated with pre-existing chronic PTSD. As noted earlier, Ms. Dicks says, and I accept, that Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct made her feel anxious and afraid at work which impacted her confidence and ability to perform her job duties. After she left the Company, she says, and I accept, that she continued to suffer psychological harm, including a major depressive episode, which lasted several months as a result of Mr. Randall\u2019s conduct.\n[52] Upon considering the duration and impact of the harassment and the range of damages for pain and suffering awarded by the Tribunal in other relevant cases of sexual harassment including NA v. 1416992 Ontario Ltd. 2018 CHRT 33 ($10,000 against the individual respondent), Opheim v. Gagan Gill and Gillco. Inc. 2016 CHRT 12 ($7,500), Green v. Thomas 2016 CHRT 13 ($5,000), and Cassidy v. Canada Post Corporation and Raj Thambirajah 2012 CHRT 29 ($5,000 against the individual respondent), I award $9,000 to Ms. Dicks as damages for pain and suffering.\nWillful and reckless conduct\n[53] Ms. Dicks claims $5,000 in damages from Mr. Randall for willful and reckless conduct.\n[54] The Tribunal may award damages of up to $20,000 if it finds that a person has engaged in a discriminatory practice wilfully or recklessly: CHRA s. 53(3).\n[55] In determining the appropriate award under this section, the Tribunal must focus on the respondent\u2019s conduct, and not on the effect that the conduct has had on the complainant: Beattie and Bangloy v. Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, 2019 CHRT 45, aff\u2019d 2021 FC 60 at para. 210.\n[56] In Canada (Attorney General) v. Johnstone, 2013 FC 113 aff\u2019d 2014 FCA 110, the Federal Court stated the following with regards to section 53(3):\nThis is a punitive provision intended to provide a deterrent and discourage those who deliberately discriminate. [\u2026] Recklessness usually denotes acts that disregard or show indifference for the consequences such that the conduct is done wantonly or heedlessly (para. 155).\n[57] If the Tribunal finds that the Respondent \u201cacted in reckless disregard of the consequences of\u201d its actions, it can award damages under this section: Warman v. Winnicki, 2006 CHRT 20 at para. 174. The more egregious the respondent\u2019s conduct is found to be, the higher the award should be and an award of $20,000 should be restricted to the most egregious of cases: First Nations Child & Family Caring Society of Canada et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (representing the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada) 2019 CHRT 39 at para. 230.\n[58] In this case, I find that Mr. Randall acted in a willful and reckless manner towards Ms. Dicks. During their employment relationship, Mr. Randall was in a position of authority over Ms. Dicks as a senior dispatcher to whom Ms. Dicks reported when he was on duty. Mr. Randall leveraged that power imbalance and engaged in sexualized behaviour when he knew or reasonably ought to have known that the conduct was unwelcomed by Ms. Dicks. When Ms. Dicks rebuffed Mr. Randall\u2019s advances, he retaliated by providing negative feedback on her work.\n[59] In these circumstances, I find that Ms. Dicks is entitled to the full $5,000 she seeks under s. 53(3) of the CHRA.\nWage loss\n[60] The Tribunal may compensate someone for wages they were deprived of as a result of discrimination: CHRA s. 53(2)(c).\n[61] In this case, Ms. Dicks testified that she reached a confidential settlement with the Company regarding her wage loss claim and was not seeking any such damages against Mr. Randall.\n[62] In these circumstances, I make no award for wage loss.\nInterest\n[63] The Tribunal may award interest on an order to pay compensation: CHRA, s. 53(4).\n[64] Any award of interest is simple interest calculated on a yearly basis, at a rate equivalent to the Bank of Canada rate (monthly series), set by the Bank of Canada. Interest would generally accrue from the date on which the discriminatory practice occurred until the date of payment of the compensation award: Rule 46, Tribunal Rules of Procedure, 2021, SOR\/2021-137.\n[65] In this case, Ms. Dicks is entitled to simple interest at the average annual bank rate established by the Bank of Canada.

The potential benefits of admitting Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence outweigh the risks 20\nI. Introduction\n[1] The Complainants are members of the Lake Babine First Nation. They allege that the Respondent RCMP discriminated against them and others by failing to properly investigate their claims that they experienced abuse while attending schools in northern British Columbia in the 1960s and 1970s. The RCMP denies that its investigation, commenced in 2012, was discriminatory.\n[2] In support of their complaint, the Complainants seek to admit an expert report by Dr. David Milward, a professor of law (\u201cReport\u201d). The Report is dated October 29, 2021 and was prepared at the request of the Complainants. It makes conclusions about historical and ongoing distrust of the RCMP by Indigenous peoples in Canada. The Report includes references to information available to the RCMP when it commenced the investigation and suggests the RCMP knew or should have known of this distrust at that time. The Report discusses the role of the RCMP in relation to residential schools and Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, as well as Indigenous Social Memory, particularly in northern BC.\n[3] The RCMP objects to the admissibility of the Report. It seeks an order pursuant to section 50(3)(e) of the Canadian Human Rights Act, RSC 1985, c H-6 [\u201cCHRA\u201d] to exclude Dr. Milward\u2019s Report and any testimony by him at the hearing of this complaint. The RCMP contests the relevance and necessity of the Report and says Dr. Milward is not a properly qualified expert as he is not providing fair, objective, and non-partisan assistance to the Tribunal. The RCMP submits that the Report\u2019s \u201cmanifest prejudice outweighs any benefits it might offer\u201d and argues that the Tribunal should exercise its gatekeeping function to exclude Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence.\n[4] The Complainants disagree with the RCMP\u2019s position. They say that the evidence presented in Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is relevant, that it is of assistance to the Tribunal and therefore necessary, and that the benefits of admitting the Report outweigh any perceived prejudice to the RCMP. They further submit that Dr. Milward is fully qualified to provide evidence concerning the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada. They argue that Dr. Milward\u2019s acknowledgment of his duty as an expert provides further evidence of his commitment to provide fair, objective and non-partisan evidence.\n[5] The Canadian Human Rights Commission (\u201cCHRC\u201d), although fully participating in the inquiry into this complaint, takes no position with respect to this Motion.\nII. Decision\n[6] The RCMP\u2019s Motion is denied. Dr. Milward\u2019s Report may be admitted as evidence during the hearing into this complaint, and Dr. Milward may provide testimony in relation to his Report as an expert witness at the hearing.\nIII. Legal Framework\n[7] The RCMP has helpfully summarized the legal principles that the Tribunal often applies to determine whether expert evidence is admissible. The Complainant agrees that these principles are applicable in this Motion.\n[8] The Supreme Court of Canada has established a legal framework for determining the admissibility of opinion evidence that \u201cguards against the dangers of expert evidence\u201d, ensuring that a hearing does not \u201cdevolve into \u2018trial by expert\u2019 and that the trier of fact maintains the ability to critically assess the evidence\u201d (R v Bingley, 2017 SCC 12 (CanLII) [\u201cBingley\u201d] at para 13). This framework was established by the Supreme Court in R v Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (SCC), [1994] 2 SCR 9 [\u201cMohan\u201d] and later clarified in White Burgess Langille Inman v Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 SCC 23 (CanLII) [\u201cWhite Burgess\u201d]. The framework includes a two-part analysis, although the Court in Bingley stated that before engaging in this analysis, the trier of fact \u201cmust determine the nature and scope of the proposed expert opinion\u201d (at para 17).\n[9] Once the nature and scope of the proposed evidence is established, the first part of the analysis requires the Tribunal to determine whether the expert evidence meets the relevant Mohan criteria for admissibility, being relevance, necessity, absence of an exclusionary rule, and a properly qualified expert (Mohan at pp. 20-25; see also White Burgess at para 19). In the present case, three of the Mohan criteria are disputed by the RCMP. As such, the Complainants must show that the proposed expert evidence is relevant, that it is necessary to assist the Tribunal, and that Dr. Milward is a properly qualified expert. If any of these threshold requirements is not met, the evidence is inadmissible and there is no need to move on to the second part of the analysis.\n[10] The second \u201cgatekeeping\u201d part of the analysis requires a weighing of the potential risks against the benefits of admitting the evidence (White Burgess at para 24).\nIV. Issues\n[11] The main issue in this Motion is whether to exclude Dr. Milward\u2019s Report and any testimony by him in this inquiry. In deciding whether to admit or exclude his proposed evidence, the Tribunal will:\nDetermine the nature and scope of the proposed expert evidence; Determine the disputed Mohan factors by deciding:\nIs the Report relevant to a fact in issue in the complaint? Is the Report necessary in the sense that the Complainants cannot provide the evidence and\/or the Tribunal requires an expert opinion to evaluate the evidence appropriately? Is Dr. Milward a properly qualified expert in the sense of providing an impartial and independent opinion?\nIf the Mohan threshold requirements are met, determine whether the potential benefits of admitting Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence outweigh the potential risks.\nV. Analysis\n[12] The Tribunal has the power to consider whether proposed expert evidence ought to be excluded and to determine its admissibility prior to a hearing (Christoforou v. John Grant Haulage Ltd., 2016 CHRT 14 (CanLII) at para 63; see also CHRA sections 48.9(2)(g) and 50(3)(e)). In the circumstances of this case, where the proposed expert has provided a lengthy and comprehensive Report, his CV, and a formal acknowledgment of his duty as an expert witness, it is appropriate to determine the admissibility of this proposed evidence at this pre-hearing stage. This will avoid delay during the hearing.\nA. The nature and scope of the proposed expert opinion evidence\n[13] The RCMP objects to the entirety of Dr. Milward\u2019s Report being admitted as evidence, and to Dr. Milward testifying at the hearing. I address these objections in the sections that follow and explain why I find that his evidence is admissible.\n[14] The Complainants submit that the RCMP\u2019s investigation of alleged abuse of students at schools in northern BC in the 1960s and 1970s was discriminatory because it did not recognize or adapt to their unique experiences as Indigenous people. Specifically, they argue that the RCMP failed in its obligation to modify its traditional investigative practices to meet their cultural needs, \u201can obligation arising from the known distrust of the RCMP by Indigenous peoples.\u201d\n[15] The Complainants intend to introduce the Report and to call Dr. Milward to testify as an expert concerning the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada. Specifically, they say that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence will establish the existence of distrust of the RCMP by Indigenous peoples, including in northern BC, and that the RCMP should have been aware of this distrust at the time it conducted its investigation. Additionally, the Complainants say that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report provides background context about interactions between the RCMP and Indigenous people leading up to the investigation in question.\n[16] The Complainants also submit that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence is critical to their claim of systemic discrimination because it is important for the Tribunal to hear evidence of the RCMP\u2019s pattern of conduct over time. They say this establishes that the RCMP historically used practices that reflected a culture of systemic discrimination against Indigenous people.\n[17] The complaint before the Tribunal is not about whether the RCMP have historically discriminated against Indigenous peoples in Canada generally. The focus of the inquiry is the RCMP\u2019s investigation of allegations of historical abuse against Indigenous children at schools in northern BC.\n[18] I accept, however, that the Complainants and the CHRC are seeking systemic remedies related to this complaint. The CHRC takes the position in its Statement of Particulars that, if the Tribunal makes a finding of discrimination based in part on systemic evidence called during the proceeding, it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to award systemic remedies. The BC Human Rights Tribunal (\u201cBCHRT\u201d), relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Moore v BC (Education), 2012 SCC 61 (CanLII) stated: \u201cThere is no question that an individual complaint can have a systemic impact and, indeed, that may be the outcome that Ms. Campbell is hoping for in this complaint: Moore at para. 63\u201d (in Campbell v Vancouver Police Board (No.2), 2019 BCHRT 128 (CanLII) [\u201cCampbell\u201d] at para 20).\n[19] At the outset of his 83-page Report, Dr. Milward indicates that he was asked by counsel for the Complainants to provide answers to four questions. However, he has framed these \u201cquestions\u201d as the following statements:\n1)Historic and ongoing distrust of RCMP by Indigenous people in Canada, including reference to information available to the RCMP in 2012 regarding whether or not they knew or should have known of this distrust at that time.\n2) The role of the RCMP in residential schools, particularly in British Columbia, and any lasting impact of that role.\n3) Evidence of historic and ongoing systemic discrimination against Indigenous people within the RCMP.\n4) The impact of discriminatory conduct by the RCMP on Indigenous people, including examples in British Columbia.\n[20] The Report is not clearly organized around these four questions or statements. Rather, the main topics covered by the Report are identified by titles that, in addition to the \u201cQuestions addressed by this Report\u201d, include Dr. Milward\u2019s \u201cQualifications\u201d, the \u201cMethodology\u201d he followed to prepare the Report, his nine \u201cFindings\u201d, as well as \u201cHistory\u201d, \u201cRCMP and Residential Schools\u201d, \u201cMissing and Murdered Indigenous Women\u201d, \u201cSocial Memory\u201d, \u201cYukon RCMP\u201d, \u201cHuman Rights Watch Report\u201d, \u201cEffects of Discrimination\u201d, \u201cAwareness of Problems\u201d, and \u201cConclusions\u201d.\n[21] In terms of his Methodology, Dr. Milward indicates that he did not conduct any primary research to prepare the Report. Rather, the Report \u201cis essentially a literature review and synthesis of previous relevant research, a good deal of which did involve primary research with members of Indigenous communities affected by actions of RCMP officers, and members of the RCMP itself.\u201d In addition to academic articles, books, masters\u2019 theses, and newspaper articles, he particularly relied on the following five reports (full citations omitted):\nA 2011 report commissioned by the RCMP called The Role of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police during the Indian Residential School System authored by Marcel-Eugene LeBeuf;\nThe 2015 Final Reports of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, particularly the volumes that focused specifically on the history of the residential schools;\nReclaiming Power and Place: The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (2019);\nA 2014 RCMP report titled Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview; and\nA2013 Human Rights Watch report on the conduct of the RCMP stationed in the North District of British Columbia titled Those Who Take Us Away: Abusive Policing and Failures in Protection of Indigenous Women and Girls in Northern British Columbia.\n[22] In his Report Dr. Milward makes general conclusions about the existence of distrust between Indigenous communities and the RCMP across Canada, including in northern BC. He states that \u201c[t]he RCMP have acted in a number of capacities against Indigenous peoples that would have encouraged Indigenous peoples to develop a negative Social Memory of the RCMP\u201d. These include its role in the assertion of Canadian sovereignty, the enforcement of Indigenous children\u2019s attendance at residential schools, the suppression of Indigenous cultures, and the repression of Indigenous protests.\n[23] Dr. Milward states that social memory is \u201cnot immutable or static\u201d, as it can change over time and can be localized. He indicates that some Indigenous communities in Canada may have developed a positive social memory of the RCMP, although he concludes that the opposite is true in northern BC. He concludes that, due to the RCMP\u2019s \u201chistory of neglect and unprofessionalism\u201d there, in large part with respect to the crisis of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Indigenous communities in the northern interior of BC may have developed a social memory of the RCMP that has become even more negative than it would otherwise have been.\n[24] Dr. Milward\u2019s Report does not make specific conclusions about the Complainants\u2019 experiences with the RCMP or about the investigation that is the subject of this human rights complaint. The Complainants submit that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is social context evidence that will assist the Tribunal to understand the relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous people in northern BC.\n[25] I accept that social context evidence can be useful to the Tribunal to establish a \u201cframe of reference or background context for deciding factual issues crucial to the resolution of a particular case\u201d (see Campbell, supra at para 22, citing R v Le, 2019 SCC 34 (CanLII) [\u201cR v Le\u201d] at para 83 and R v Spence, 2005 SCC 71 (CanLII) [\u201cSpence\u201d] at para 57).\n[26] I agree that the Complainants may introduce Dr. Milward\u2019s Report and call Dr. Milward as an expert witness concerning the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada. The nature and scope of his evidence should be limited to this topic and may include evidence about historical and ongoing distrust of the RCMP by Indigenous peoples, including in northern BC.\n[27] Dr. Milward\u2019s social context evidence will not replace the Tribunal\u2019s own fact-finding, which will be guided by the evidence that will be advanced by the parties in relation to this complaint. The Complainants may not seek Dr. Milward\u2019s opinion on the ultimate issues that the Tribunal must determine in this case, such as the existence of individual or systemic discrimination in relation to the facts of this complaint.\nB. The Disputed Mohan Factors\n(i) The proposed expert evidence is relevant\n[28] In determining the relevance of the Report, I must consider whether the proposed evidence is logically relevant to a fact in issue in this complaint (R v Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII) [\u201cAbbey\u201d] at para 82). The RCMP submits that expert evidence must relate to the facts of the case and argues that the events Dr. Milward opines on bear no relevance to the present inquiry.\n[29] There is some disagreement between the parties about the scope of the complaint before the Tribunal, with the RCMP defining what is at issue in the inquiry more narrowly than the Complainants and CHRC. The Tribunal has previously concluded that it is the Statements of Particulars (\u201cSOP\u201d) filed by the parties that set the more precise terms of the hearing, as opposed to the initial complaint filed with the CHRC (Casler v Canadian National Railway, 2017 CHRT 6 (CanLII) at para 9).\n[30] The RCMP says in its SOP and in this Motion that the only issue before the Tribunal is \u201cwhether the investigation by Corporal Mackie \u2026 was carried out in a discriminatory manner.\u201d It says it is within this narrow scope that any opinion evidence should be tendered and that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report \u201cnot only does not stay within this scope, it never enters it.\u201d\n[31] Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation involved a complaint of childhood sexual abuse by one individual who attended Immaculata school. In its SOP, the RCMP says Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation was thorough and careful and not discriminatory. It also indicates that, in addition to Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation, it set up a separate file, led by a different officer, to investigate more generalized statements of physical abuse suffered at Immaculata school. Neither investigation resulted in charges being laid, as the RCMP concluded that there were no reasonable and probable grounds to support charge referral to the Crown or to warrant further investigation.\n[32] In their Reply to the RCMP\u2019s SOP, the Complainants dispute that their complaint is limited to Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation into one criminal complaint or the outcome of that investigation. Rather, they say their claim concerns discrimination by the RCMP in its investigation of childhood abuse by school personnel in BC as brought to light by the six Complainants and many other witnesses.\n[33] In their SOP, the Complainants state that the RCMP employed traditional investigative practices when investigating historical allegations of abuse against Indigenous children. For example, they allege that the RCMP did not obtain production orders to obtain relevant records or notes, and that the RCMP: did not contact or interview everyone who had made affidavits or statements; required that complainants initiate contact with the RCMP rather than the other way around; did not offer support to most of the victims reporting abuse who were experiencing pain and trauma, or offer translation services to complainants who only spoke the Carrier language; categorized as uncooperative some witnesses without addressing collective or intergenerational trauma; did not follow up on information provided about abuse at Prince George College and other Diocese schools; and, did not report back to individuals it had interviewed about the outcome of its investigation.\n[34] The Complainants allege that the RCMP\u2019s traditional investigative practices are discriminatory in that they fail to meet the needs of Indigenous victims of abuse. They say that their race was a factor in the adverse impact they experienced because the RCMP\u2019s stereotypes and biased attitudes toward Indigenous complainants caused deficiencies in carrying out its investigation. They allege that the discrimination was systemic and they are asking the Tribunal to order systemic remedies, including that the RCMP modify its traditional practices to meet Indigenous peoples\u2019 cultural needs.\n[35] In its SOP, the CHRC states that the Tribunal must consider the social context from which this human rights complaint arose by assessing the complaint against the backdrop of the past and present effects of colonialism and historical trauma on Indigenous peoples. The CHRC states that the Complainants draw a clear link between their mistrust of the RCMP arising from Canada\u2019s colonial legacy and the way in which the RCMP\u2019s investigation was conducted and impacted them.\n[36] Based on the SOPs filed by the parties, I accept that the scope of the complaint referred to the Tribunal for an inquiry is broader than whether Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation of one individual\u2019s complaint was discriminatory.\n[37] The Complainants have the onus of proving prima facie discrimination on a balance of probabilities. They argue that Dr. Milward\u2019s proposed expert evidence will assist them in doing so by establishing that the RCMP knew or ought to have known that Indigenous peoples in northern BC did not likely trust the RCMP at the time of its investigation. Although the Complainants and their witnesses can testify about their own distrust of the RCMP, they cannot provide evidence about what the RCMP knew or ought to have known. The Complainants say that the RCMP has not provided its position regarding this issue yet. However, if the RCMP is going to suggest that it was unaware that Indigenous people had a negative social memory or collective distrust of the RCMP, they say that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence will rebut that position.\n[38] The Complainants also say that, even though their claim is about the RCMP\u2019s investigation into their experiences of childhood abuse in northern British Columbia, it \u201crepresents the experiences of many other Indigenous people nationwide.\u201d They say their complaint demonstrates systemic discrimination that exists in police investigative methods and shows how Indigenous victims of abuse suffer adverse impacts like being disbelieved or subjected to inadequate investigations, receiving little or no support, and being treated with a lack of respect and dignity.\n[39] The Complainants say that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence is critical to their claim of systemic discrimination because it is important for the Tribunal to hear evidence about the RCMP\u2019s pattern of conduct over time, which establishes that the RCMP historically used practices that reflected a culture of systemic discrimination against Indigenous individuals. They say that this evidence can only be established through an expert qualified to properly analyze that history, such as Dr. Milward.\n[40] The RCMP says the Report provides no opinion on specific discriminatory conduct by Corporal Mackie or the RCMP on the facts of this case, nor does Dr. Milward discuss any specific shortcomings in the RCMP\u2019s investigation whatsoever or proffer any alternative investigative approaches that would have been non-discriminatory in his opinion. The RCMP argues that Dr. Milward should have set out the facts which he has assumed and then rendered an opinion on these assumptions in a manner that connected it with the historical claims in his report.\n[41] There is no requirement for an expert witness to advance an opinion with respect to the specific facts of the complaint (see McKay v Toronto Police Services Board, 2011 HRTO 499 (CanLII) [\u201cMcKay\u201d] at para 95). As previously noted, the Supreme Court of Canada has concluded that \u201csocial fact\u201d evidence that is not specific to a case but that links to adjudicative facts may be admitted to help explain aspects of the evidence, such as \u201cdifficulties faced by aboriginal people in both the criminal justice system and throughout society at large\u201d (in Spence, supra at para 57).\n[42] With regard to the RCMP\u2019s argument that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report focuses on topics not relevant to the present inquiry such as the RCMP\u2019s role in the residential school system and its failings in investigating Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, I accept that this information has been included in the Report because it is part of the Indigenous Social Memory Dr. Milward discusses. I agree with the CHRC\u2019s position in its SOP that the Tribunal must consider the social context from which this human rights complaint arose by assessing the complaint against the backdrop of the effects of colonialism and historical trauma on Indigenous peoples. The CHRC is correct that the Complainants draw a clear link between their distrust of the RCMP arising from Canada\u2019s colonial legacy and the way in which the RCMP\u2019s investigation was conducted and impacted them.\n[43] I agree that, in considering and determining the facts and issues in this case, the Tribunal will benefit from the fullest possible understanding of the background context between the parties.\n[44] The RCMP also argues that, to the extent Dr. Milward\u2019s Report implies that Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation was discriminatory or not thorough, this is irrelevant because the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (\u201cCRCC\u201d) concluded that similar complaints were unfounded. The Complainants say the CRCC\u2019s findings are not relevant to the Complainants\u2019 allegation of discriminatory investigative methods. I agree with the Complainants as the CRCC\u2019s report, provided by the RCMP, does not appear to consider allegations that the investigation was discriminatory.\n[45] I agree that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is logically relevant to the issue of whether the RCMP knew or ought to have known of the distrust held for the RCMP by Indigenous peoples in northern BC at the time it conducted its investigation. This is relevant to the Complainant\u2019s argument that the RCMP\u2019s investigation should have been adapted to meet the needs of the Indigenous complainants. As such, his proposed evidence passes the relevance threshold.\n[46] The parties will be permitted to make their arguments about the relevance of Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence to other facts or issues raised in the case, including the allegations of systemic discrimination, as well as to the weight the Tribunal should give to Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence.\n(ii) The proposed expert evidence is necessary\n[47] The necessity criteria is met if the proposed expert evidence enables the Tribunal to appreciate the matters in issue by providing information outside of its experience and knowledge (Bingley, supra at para 15; Mohan, supra at p.23).\n[48] The RCMP argues that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is unnecessary to assist the Tribunal, as much of his opinion is founded on other published reports or research. It suggests that Dr. Milward appears to take the opinions set out in the Human Rights Watch Report as fact, which he then uses to bolster the position of the Complainants. As it cannot cross examine Human Rights Watch or otherwise challenge their findings, the RCMP argues that it would be contrary to procedural fairness to allow expert testimony based on these findings.\n[49] A similar argument was made in Campbell, supra and the BCHRT dismissed this argument as follows:\nFinally, the VPB objects to Dr. Miller\u2019s reliance on secondary sources, which cannot be tested through cross-examination. It does not cite any legal authority for this objection and I am not aware of any. The nature of expert social science evidence, surely, is that it is reasonable to expect an expert to rely on and incorporate the work of others. I do not find this argument warrants a ruling that all or part of the Report is inadmissible (para 29).\n[50] I agree with the BCHRT in this respect. Expert witnesses are permitted to provide a foundation for their opinion through reference to reports and studies. In McWilliam v Toronto Police Services Board, 2017 HRTO 19 (CanLII) [\u201cMcWilliam\u201d], the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario (\u201cHRTO\u201d) allowed an expert to testify about the social context relating to gender in policing and disagreed that the expert\u2019s reference to various studies amounted to hearsay or \u201coath helping\u201d (at paras 48-50).\n[51] The RCMP also argues that, to the extent the Report attempts to justify the Complainants\u2019 testimony, it is oath helping and therefore inadmissible. It says that four of Dr. Milward\u2019s nine \u201cFindings\u201d in particular run afoul of the ban on oath helping, as they seek to augment the Complainants\u2019 evidence about their relationship with the RCMP. These findings relate to the RCMP\u2019s reported conduct in the North District of British Columbia (for example, actions consistent with racial profiling and mishandling complaints made by Indigenous people, as well as criminally victimizing Indigenous persons). Dr. Milward concludes these actions would have negatively affected the Indigenous Social Memory of the RCMP in that region and had \u201ctangible social effects\u201d, including a lack of confidence in the RCMP\u2019s ability or willingness to treat Indigenous people fairly or protect them, and may have compounded the lingering effects of intergenerational trauma.\n[52] The rule against oath helping \u201cholds that evidence adduced solely for the purpose of proving that a witness is truthful is inadmissible\u201d (R v Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (SCC) at para 28). I do not agree with the RCMP that Dr. Milward\u2019s opinion evidence, either in relation to these four Findings or generally, will violate the rule against oath helping, as this evidence is not being called solely to prove that the Complainants or their witnesses are being truthful.\n[53] So long as Dr. Milward remains objective, the fact that his evidence supports the Complainants\u2019 case is not fatal to its admission. As the Court in Peart v Peel (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board, 2003 CanLII 42339 (ON SC) [\u201cPeart\u201d] stated:\nThat is the classic role of the expert: to provide the court with a ready-made inference based on scientific, medical, psychiatric, engineering or similar learning, which the court can draw if certain identified underlying facts are demonstrated to exist. \u2026 But the inference is one that the court draws (para 23).\n[54] Dr. Milward\u2019s opinion is not a substitute for the Tribunal\u2019s own analysis of the evidence. In considering the evidence before it, the Tribunal may take into account the relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous people in northern BC in its historical and racial context, as provided by Dr. Milward. At the same time, the Tribunal does not have to accept the opinion or inference of an expert witness. It is available for the Tribunal to accept if it is \u201cpersuaded on the balance of probabilities that it is the more probable explanation for the events in question\u201d (Peart at para 23).\n[55] Justice Sopinka in Mohan stated: \"I would not judge necessity by too strict a standard. What is required is that the opinion be necessary in the sense that it provide information \u2018which is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of a judge or jury\u2019\u201d (at p.23). The HRTO has stated that \u201cthere is a lower threshold for showing that the evidence is necessary to assist the trier of fact in discrimination cases as compared to criminal cases. This is because of the nature of human rights proceedings and the often subtle nature of discrimination\u201d (McWilliam, supra at para 46; Nassiah v Peel Regional Police Services Board, 2006 HRTO 18 (CanLII) [\u201cNassiah\u201d] at paras 36 to 37).\n[56] I agree with the Complainants that Dr. Milward\u2019s ability to review and critique the relevant voluminous reports, as a result of his knowledge of the subject-matter and his expertise in assessing the validity of social science studies, is valuable to the Tribunal, as that is beyond the Tribunal\u2019s ability and expertise. As the Nova Scotia Human Rights Board of Inquiry stated, human rights tribunals are:\npresumed to possess a certain expertise in the law of discrimination and human rights, but do not necessarily possess expert knowledge in the practices and impact of racism beyond a basic understanding of their dynamics. \u2026 Racism takes many guises, exists in many different environments and it is studied by a great variety of social scientists using various methodologies. A given board of inquiry is unlikely to be up to date on all this literature\u2026One method of providing this evidence to a board is of course simply to submit published works on the relevant matters, but works cannot be cross-examined (Johnson v Halifax Regional Police Service, 2003 CanLII 89397 (NS HRC) at para 85).\n[57] The BCHRT in Radek v Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. and others (No.2), 2004 BCHRT 340 (CanLII) stated that \u201cevidence may be necessary which serves the function of clarifying or contextualizing the issues in dispute\u201d (para 33). I find that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is necessary to assist the Tribunal to fully appreciate the social context underlying the complaint, being the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada, including in northern BC.\n[58] While the Tribunal can read the publicly-available reports referred to by Dr. Milward in his Report, these reports themselves cannot be cross-examined. However, the RCMP may cross-examine Dr. Milward if they wish to challenge the basis of his opinions or to seek clarification regarding his methodology and analysis. In that respect, Dr. Milward has identified aspects of the studies and reports about which he was critical in terms of methodology or interpretations. This is expertise the Tribunal does not have. As the Complainants note, it is Dr. Milward\u2019s professional and academic experience, discussed in detail in the next section, that permits an analysis of these documents that is outside of the Tribunal\u2019s experience and knowledge.\n(iii) Dr. Milward is a properly qualified expert\n[59] A properly qualified expert is one who is \u201cshown to have acquired special or peculiar knowledge through study or experience in respect of the matters on which he or she undertakes to testify\u201d (Mohan, supra at p. 27). An expert \u201cmust not only be qualified generally but must also be qualified to express the specific opinion proffered\u201d (R v Orr, 2015 BCCA 88 at para 67).\n[60] The Complainants argue that Dr. Milward is fully qualified to provide evidence concerning the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada. They state that he \u201cpossesses specialized knowledge and skill by virtue of his academic background in the subject-matter of interactions between Indigenous people and the police, and he has expertise in assessing the validity of social science studies.\u201d\n[61] At the outset of his Report, Dr. Milward indicates that he is an Associate Professor of Law at the University of Victoria and the Acting Director of the Joint Indigenous Law Degree Program of the University. His \u201cscholarly research focuses on the interactions of Indigenous peoples with the Canadian criminal justice system \u2026 [including] historical interactions between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state\u201d. He indicates that his research has had a pronounced interdisciplinary emphasis, drawing upon fields such anthropology, history, ethnohistory, criminology and sociology, in addition to law.\n[62] According to Dr. Milward\u2019s CV, he has a PhD in Law from the University of British Columbia and he has written a book titled Aboriginal Justice and the Charter: Realizing a Culturally Sensitive Interpretation of Legal Rights in Canada (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2012), as well as a book chapter and several peer-reviewed articles.\n[63] Dr. Milward indicates in his Report that some of his work has focused on the interactions between the police and Indigenous peoples. For example, several sections of his 2012 book deal with this subject, as well as his 2012 article in the Criminal Law Quarterly that focuses specifically on the RCMP and police profiling of Indigenous peoples as potential security threats in the context of suppressing Indigenous protests.\n[64] I accept that, through his academic studies and work as a professor and interdisciplinary researcher, Dr. Milward has acquired the specialized knowledge of the matters on which he undertakes to testify. In my view, he is qualified to provide evidence on the issue of the relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous people, including in northern BC.\n[65] The RCMP has not raised an objection to Professor Milward\u2019s qualifications. Rather, it says that a proposed expert\u2019s primary duty is to provide fair, non-partisan and objective assistance, and argues that Dr. Milward falls well short of that standard. It says his Report is not neutral but crosses over into advocacy by expressing views critical of the RCMP\u2019s conduct. The RCMP submit that Dr. Milward refers to events that are irrelevant to the facts of the complaint and he appears to \u201caccept as fact unproven testimonials from unrelated investigations\u201d, \u201cpronounces judgment on other events\u201d, \u201cstrays into periods well after the investigation\u201d, relies on \u201cvague, unattributed, or generalized negative sentiments against the RCMP, many of which are hearsay\u201d, and \u201ccasually cites inflammatory and prejudicial statements\u201d.\n[66] The RCMP cites examples that it says support Dr. Milward\u2019s view that the RCMP engaged in egregious conduct in northern BC, including his reliance on the Human Rights Watch Report and his statement that the behaviour of RCMP officers in the Northern District \u201cmay have introduced communities-wide trauma into Indigenous communities in the northern interior that originates squarely with the RCMP instead of residential schools.\u201d The RCMP submits that, as he is unable to fulfil an expert\u2019s duty, he is not properly qualified to be one.\n[67] The Complainants disagree that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report amounts to advocacy and rely on his exceptional qualifications and his signed \u201cAcknowledgment of Expert\u2019s Duty\u201d provided along with his Report and CV. Dr. Milward acknowledges his duty to provide opinion evidence that is fair, objective and non-partisan and within his area of expertise, and that this duty prevails over any obligation he may owe to the Complainants, on whose behalf he is engaged.\n[68] The RCMP disputes that Dr. Milward\u2019s acknowledgment of an expert\u2019s duty is evidence of his ability to provide \u201cfair, objective and non-partisan evidence\u201d. It argues that, if experts could \u201cself-certify\u201d, there would be no role for the Tribunal in screening their testimony.\n[69] In White Burgess, supra the Supreme Court of Canada stated that, once the expert attests to their duty to provide impartial, independent and unbiased evidence, there is an evidential burden on the party opposing admission to show a realistic concern that the expert is unable or unwilling to comply with this duty (at para 48). While agreeing that an expert who assumes the role of an advocate for a party \u201cis clearly unwilling and\/or unable to carry out the primary duty to the court\u201d, the Court stated that exclusion at this stage will be quite rare and only in the clearest of cases. Anything less than clear unwillingness or inability to provide the Tribunal with fair, objective and non-partisan evidence should not lead to exclusion, but should be considered in the overall weighing of the costs and benefits of receiving the evidence (White Burgess at para 49).\n[70] The RCMP submits that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is a \u201cfull throated critique of the RCMP\u201d, that it surveys recent events unconnected to the investigation at issue in this complaint, and that he says little, if anything, about the good the RCMP has done in Indigenous communities and Northern BC. The RCMP argues that these all illustrate the one-sidedness of the report and, as he is acting as an advocate for the Complainants, he is not a properly qualified expert.\n[71] I agree with the Complainants that the examples or statements used by the RCMP to argue that Dr. Milward is acting as an advocate are provided outside of the full context of the Report and that they are clarified by reading the Report in its entirety. I accept that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report, which includes his reliance on past reports, provides social context for the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada, including in northern British Columbia.\n[72] The RCMP is free to call evidence to contradict some or all of Dr. Milward\u2019s Report, or that addresses areas not covered in detail by the Report, for example evidence of the good the RCMP has done in northern BC. Presumably its own witnesses who have worked in northern BC would be in a position to provide such evidence. Dr. Milward acknowledges that he did not conduct any primary research to prepare his Report but instead reviewed previous studies and reports, much of which did involve primary research with both Indigenous communities and members of the RCMP. If there are studies or reports that provide contradictory information or a different analysis of the information provided by Dr. Milward, the RCMP can seek to introduce them as evidence at the hearing.\n[73] I do not view Dr. Milward\u2019s Report as being a \u201cfull throated critique of the RCMP\u201d. I note that the Report does speak about the history of Indigenous people and the RCMP as being nuanced, and that he states more than once that the RCMP can and has overcome the \u201cdefault negative Social Memory held by Indigenous peoples\u201d. He says that, in some Indigenous communities, the social memory of the RCMP has become more positive with \u201cconsistent positive action over time\u201d.\n[74] I agree with the Complainants that, simply because the RCMP does not like or agree with Dr. Milward\u2019s opinions, this does not make them unfair or partisan.\n[75] In terms of the RCMP\u2019s concern that Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is not \u201cneutral\u201d but is instead advocacy, I note that there is no requirement for expert evidence to be neutral. Rather, expert evidence must be \u201cimpartial in the sense that it reflects an objective assessment of the questions at hand\u201d (White Burgess, supra at para 32). As the HRTO helpfully stated in McKay, supra:\nObjectivity does not mean that an expert is devoid of community connections and\/or derives opinions in abstraction absent any familiarity with the parties or their counsel. Experts are proffered precisely because they have expansive or deep knowledge of the field and respected reputations and affiliations \u2026 . Further, in the human rights context, I am sensitive to the access to justice concerns for marginalized and equity seeking groups that may arise if rules of evidence are rigidly applied to exclude potential experts that have worked within or on behalf of such groups. A Tribunal\u2019s inquiry with respect to (im)partiality should focus on whether, considering the nature and degree of association, the expert is able and willing to provide independent, objective and authoritative evidence, not argument, to assist the decision-maker regardless of which side the information favours (at para 99).\n[76] Human rights tribunals have recognized that criticism by an expert does not necessarily equate to advocacy. In McWilliam, supra the HRTO assessed the expert\u2019s objectivity following an objection by the respondent that she was a feminist advocate. In that case, the Tribunal held:\n[T]he fact that Professor Corsianos has been critical of the treatment of women in policing does not, in and of itself, make her incapable of providing fair, objective and non-partisan evidence. It also does not make her a partisan advocate. One may well be critical of certain phenomena while also being fair, objective and non-partisan. This would be the case, for example, if there are things to legitimately be critical about in relation to the phenomena, institutions or social entities being studied (para 54).\n[77] The Complainants argue that Dr. Milward\u2019s critiques of the RCMP do not render him incapable of providing fair, objective, non-partisan evidence or make him a partisan advocate. Further, they submit that there is a legitimate basis upon which Dr. Milward is critical of the RCMP\u2019s conduct concerning Indigenous people, which he explains in detail in his Report and includes findings from reliable reports and studies. In particular, the Complainants note that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Final Report and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls Final Report have been relied upon by other decision makers, including criminal courts, for the truth of their contents as social context (see R v A.(M.), 2020 NUCJ 4 (CanLII) at para 19 and Campbell v Vancouver Police Board (No.4), 2019 BCHRT 275 (CanLII) at paras 111-112).\n[78] I do not find that the RCMP has met its burden of establishing that there is a realistic concern that Dr. Milward is unable or unwilling to comply with his duty to provide the Tribunal with impartial, independent and unbiased evidence. As discussed in the \u201cnecessity\u201d section above, the fact that Dr. Milward relies on and incorporates the works of others in his Report does not make it inadmissible.\n[79] In my view, Dr. Milward is qualified to provide evidence on the historical and ongoing relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada, which comprises evidence about historical and ongoing distrust of the RCMP by Indigenous peoples, including in northern BC. Dr. Milward\u2019s academic studies and work experience provide him with the specialized knowledge and skills to review and critique the voluminous reports referred to in his Report. I agree with the Complainants that he possesses both knowledge of the subject-matter and expertise in assessing the validity of social science studies.\nC. The potential benefits of admitting Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence outweigh the risks\n[80] As I have concluded that Dr. Milward\u2019s proposed evidence meets the threshold Mohan requirements for admissibility, I move on to the second stage of the analysis. At this gatekeeping stage, the Tribunal is to determine whether the potential benefits of admitting the proposed expert evidence outweigh any potential harm to the hearing process or prejudice to another party. The Supreme Court in White Burgess, supra indicated that, at this stage, relevance, necessity, reliability and the absence of bias play a role in weighing the overall competing considerations in admitting the evidence. The Court stated that, at the end of the day, the trier of fact must be satisfied that the potential helpfulness of the evidence is not outweighed by the risks associated with expert evidence (at para 54). Possible risks include delay and longer hearings, adjournments, increased cost, improper deference to the expert, junk science and competing experts (White Burgess at para 18).\n[81] The RCMP argues that, even if the Tribunal finds that the Report meets all of the Mohan thresholds, the combined effect of all of the defects in the Report renders the dangers of its admission far greater than any conceivable benefit it could provide. It submits that Dr. Milward makes broad generalizations about RCMP investigations in Northern BC even while admitting he has limited information for assessing discriminatory conduct. The RCMP argues that the \u201csweeping overbreadth\u201d of the Report, which introduces facts and opinions on matters such as residential schools and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls inquiry, is a distraction from the specific discrimination claim before the Tribunal, which it says is Corporal Mackie\u2019s investigation. It says that the \u201chistory and conduct of the RCMP since its inception are not before this Tribunal.\u201d\n[82] The Complainants say that the \u201cdefects\u201d in the Report that the RCMP refers to are in fact admissible context evidence.\n[83] I acknowledge that the Report covers topics that may initially seem unrelated to the alleged discriminatory investigation at issue in this complaint. However, I accept that the Report covers these various topics because they are part of the context of the relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous peoples in Canada, including in northern BC. The Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed the importance of understanding the social context of interactions between police and racialized groups when adjudicating the circumstances of a specific encounter (see R v Le, supra at para 86). I accept that the same understanding of the background context is important when considering allegations of discrimination, both individual and systemic.\n[84] I understand that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence is being proffered by the Complainants in order to situate the relationship between the RCMP and Indigenous people in its historical and racial context. They assert that this is relevant to the social context underlying their complaint of discrimination. I am of the view that the potential benefits of this evidence outweigh any possible harm to the hearing process. This is not a case where the proposed expert evidence relates to a subject completely unfamiliar to a human rights tribunal. There is no risk of admitting \u201cjunk science\u201d that could result in a miscarriage of justice. There is also no reason to believe that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence will unduly delay the hearing or lead to adjournments.\n[85] The RCMP also argues that the Report is entirely prejudicial to it as the Respondent. It says that, by listing the many wrongs that Dr. Milward feels the RCMP has committed, \u201cthe report implies it must follow they committed wrongs here too\u201d and so opines on the ultimate issue for the Tribunal to determine. It alleges that seeking to colour the facts of the present complaint in light of alleged past wrongs is prejudicial.\n[86] The Complainants submit that an unfavourable report is not the same as a prejudicial report. They state that Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence does not address the ultimate issue regarding whether the investigative practices in question demonstrate individual or systemic discrimination against Indigenous people, or whether alternate investigative methods to meet the needs of the Indigenous complainants should have been used.\n[87] I agree that simply because Dr. Milward\u2019s Report presents information that the RCMP may disagree with does not necessarily make it prejudicial. The RCMP will be able to cross-examine Dr. Milward and call its own evidence and make submissions about the relevance and appropriate weight of his evidence.\n[88] In terms of any concern that Dr. Milward\u2019s opinion could be given undue deference, the Tribunal understands that Dr. Milward\u2019s opinion evidence does not usurp the Tribunal\u2019s role of assessing credibility, finding facts and determining the factual and legal issues in this complaint. The Tribunal is well aware that it must make the determination about whether discrimination has occurred in this matter and will decide, after a full hearing of the evidence and submissions from the parties, what weight, if any, to give to Dr. Milward\u2019s evidence.\n[89] I do not find that the RCMP has established that the potential harm to the hearing process or the risk of prejudice to the RCMP outweigh the potential benefits of admitting Dr. Milward\u2019s proposed evidence. Rather, I find that his expected evidence has the possibility to be sufficiently beneficial to this proceeding to warrant its admission, while the likelihood of harm or prejudice in doing so is minimal. Dr. Milward\u2019s Report is admissible and he may testify as an expert witness at the hearing into this complaint.\nSigned by\nColleen Harrington\nTribunal Member\nOttawa, Ontario\nMarch 7, 2023\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nParties of Record\nTribunal File:\nT2459\/1620\nStyle of Cause:\nWoodgate et al. v RCMP\nRuling of the Tribunal Dated: March 7, 2023\nMotion dealt with in writing without appearance of parties\nWritten representations by:\nWhitney Dunn, Rupinder K.

La politique de la GRC autorisait le gendarme Desson \u00e0 reprendre son travail de policier de premi\u00e8re ligne apr\u00e8s cinq ans sans crise.\nLe gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette politique de la GRC \u00e9tait discriminatoire parce qu\u2019elle ne tenait pas compte du fait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s peu probable qu\u2019il fasse une autre crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir perdu des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 cause de cette politique. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 promu \u00e0 cause de cette politique. Le Tribunal a reconnu que le gendarme Desson avait perdu des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison de son \u00e9pilepsie. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas reconnu qu\u2019il avait manqu\u00e9 des promotions \u00e0 cause de son \u00e9pilepsie.\nLa GRC a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait besoin de sa politique en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des agents de police et du public. Le Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec la GRC. La politique r\u00e9duit le risque qu\u2019un policier fasse une crise dans une situation dangereuse. Les preuves m\u00e9dicales montrent que le risque est tr\u00e8s faible apr\u00e8s cinq ans. La politique de la GRC est semblable \u00e0 celles d\u2019autres emplois pr\u00e9sentant des risques de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 similaires. La GRC a tenu compte de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux du gendarme Desson lorsqu\u2019elle a appliqu\u00e9 la politique. La GRC a essay\u00e9 de trouver au gendarme Desson un travail de bureau utile qu\u2019il pourrait faire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il puisse retourner aux services de police de premi\u00e8re ligne.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2023 TCDP\n1\nDate : le\n10 janvier 2023\nNum\u00e9ro du dossier :\nT2276\/3118\n[TRADUCTION FRAN\u00c7AISE]\nEntre :\nMichael Eric Desson\nle plaignant\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nGendarmerie royale du Canada\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e\nD\u00e9cision\nMembre :\nMarie Langlois\nTable des mati\u00e8res\nI.

D\u00e9cision\n[1] Le Tribunal rejette la plainte de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience du gendarme Michael Eric Desson (le \u00ab plaignant \u00bb). Le Tribunal conclut que, bien que la preuve \u00e9tablisse que le plaignant a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC) a justifi\u00e9 ses actes discriminatoires en d\u00e9montrant que la norme appliqu\u00e9e au plaignant constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e.\n[2] Le Tribunal rejette la demande d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant relativement au comportement abusif ou \u00e0 l\u2019entrave de l\u2019intim\u00e9e pendant l\u2019audience, faute de preuve.\nII. Aper\u00e7u\n[3] Le 28 janvier 2008, la GRC (l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9e \u00bb) a embauch\u00e9 M. Desson \u00e0 titre de gendarme. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, en Colombie-Britannique, o\u00f9, apr\u00e8s avoir termin\u00e9 sa formation, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler de fa\u00e7on autonome \u00e0 partir du mois d\u2019octobre 2008.\n[4] Le 14 juillet 2010, alors qu\u2019il conduisait son v\u00e9hicule personnel pour se rendre au travail, M. Desson a fait une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 un accident.\n[5] M. Desson s\u2019est absent\u00e9 du travail pour cause de maladie jusqu\u2019au 6 novembre 2010, date \u00e0 laquelle il a entam\u00e9 un retour progressif au travail. \u00c0 son retour au travail, ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives.\n[6] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 une politique de l\u2019intim\u00e9e (la \u00ab politique de cinq ans \u00bb), M. Desson ne pouvait r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles que cinq ans apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, qu\u2019il prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments anticonvulsivants. Dans les faits, il a r\u00e9int\u00e9gr\u00e9 ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles juste avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, en mai 2015, alors qu\u2019il prenait des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[7] La p\u00e9riode allant de novembre 2010 \u00e0 mai 2015 a \u00e9t\u00e9 ponctu\u00e9e d\u2019absences pour trouble psychiatrique, qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le plaignant, \u00e9taient attribuables \u00e0 sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 la politique de cinq ans qui l\u2019emp\u00eachait de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles avant 2015. Le plaignant soutient qu\u2019une autre p\u00e9riode de cong\u00e9 pour trouble psychiatrique entre 2017 et 2021 serait \u00e9galement li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa r\u00e9action \u00e0 la politique de cinq ans.\n[8] Le plaignant est d\u2019avis que la politique de cinq ans lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice et qu\u2019elle est discriminatoire en ce sens qu\u2019elle s\u2019applique \u00e0 lui sans \u00e9gard \u00e0 ses caract\u00e9ristiques personnelles et au risque que ses crises se reproduisent.\n[9] Le plaignant soutient que la politique s\u2019applique \u00e0 toute personne ayant eu des crises, qu\u2019elles aient \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9es par la maladie ou par la consommation de certains stimulants, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Selon lui, il a cess\u00e9 de prendre les stimulants en cause apr\u00e8s sa crise de juillet 2010 et aurait pu reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles six mois plus tard, sur la recommandation de son m\u00e9decin, le Dr John Diggle, neurologue. Comme il devra prendre des m\u00e9dicaments pour le reste de sa vie, il estime que la politique initiale est encore plus d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, m\u00eame si c\u2019est en fait la politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e dans son cas. J\u2019y reviendrai.\n[10] Selon le plaignant, l\u2019application de la politique en question l\u2019a \u00e9galement priv\u00e9 de possibilit\u00e9s de formation et d\u2019avancement professionnel, ce qui aurait eu et aurait toujours des r\u00e9percussions financi\u00e8res importantes pour lui.\n[11] La GRC fait valoir que le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9 du fardeau qui lui incombait d\u2019\u00e9tablir la discrimination prima facie. Elle remet en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et la valeur probante du t\u00e9moignage du plaignant. Elle soutient que l\u2019application de la politique par l\u2019employeur n\u2019a caus\u00e9 aucun effet pr\u00e9judiciable au plaignant. Selon elle, c\u2019est l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du plaignant de reconna\u00eetre son \u00e9tat pathologique (l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie) et sa crainte d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9 d\u00e9favorablement par ses pairs et ses sup\u00e9rieurs qui ont fait en sorte qu\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 un certain temps avant qu\u2019il retourne au travail. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement que le plaignant a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 apparent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du comportement discriminatoire.\n[12] Subsidiairement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la politique de l\u2019employeur a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e au plaignant \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de sa situation personnelle et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e par d\u2019importantes consid\u00e9rations visant \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du plaignant, de ses coll\u00e8gues et du public, compte tenu de la nature dangereuse des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles des agents de la GRC. En somme, la GRC est d\u2019avis que la politique de cinq ans constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e aux termes des paragraphes 15(1) et 15(2) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb ou la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[13] De plus, dans ses observations \u00e9crites, le plaignant demande des d\u00e9pens pour le comportement abusif et l\u2019entrave de la GRC, parce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a omis de divulguer certains documents avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience.\nIII. Questions en litige\n[14] Les questions en litige sont les suivantes :\nEst-ce que le plaignant poss\u00e8de une ou des caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi?\nSi oui, le plaignant a-t-il subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 son emploi aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019intim\u00e9e?\nSi oui, la ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de retirer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles au plaignant?\nSi oui, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle justifi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision selon l\u2019article 15 de la Loi?\nSi non, quelles sont les mesures de r\u00e9paration applicables?\nLa GRC a-t-elle adopt\u00e9 un comportement abusif et commis une entrave en ne divulguant certains documents qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019audience?\nSi oui, le plaignant a-t-il droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9?\nIV. Cadre juridique\n[15] Le plaignant pr\u00e9tend avoir fait l\u2019objet de discrimination en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi fond\u00e9e sur une d\u00e9ficience, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi.\n[16] La d\u00e9ficience est un des motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi. Elle est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 :\n\u00ab d\u00e9ficience \u00bb D\u00e9ficience physique ou mentale, qu\u2019elle soit pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, y compris le d\u00e9figurement ainsi que la d\u00e9pendance, pr\u00e9sente ou pass\u00e9e, envers l\u2019alcool ou la drogue.\n[17] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi dispose, entre autres, que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un ou plusieurs des motifs de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un individu en cours d\u2019emploi. L\u2019article 10 dispose que constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la Loi, le fait d\u2019annihiler les chances d\u2019emploi ou d\u2019avancement d\u2019un individu.\n[18] Avant d\u2019aborder les questions en litige, il convient de pr\u00e9ciser que le fardeau incombe au plaignant d\u2019\u00e9tablir la discrimination prima facie (autrement dit, d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination). La preuve est celle qui \u00ab porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur [du plaignant], en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536 [Simpsons-Sears], au par. 28).\n[19] La jurisprudence reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il est difficile de prouver des all\u00e9gations de discrimination par une preuve directe, puisque la discrimination n\u2019est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne qui se manifeste directement et ouvertement. Il appartient donc au Tribunal de tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances et d\u2019\u00e9tablir selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s s\u2019il y a discrimination ou s\u2019il existe, tel qu\u2019il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP), de \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb. En somme, le Tribunal peut conclure \u00e0 la discrimination prima facie lorsque la preuve dont il dispose rend cette conclusion plus probable que les autres conclusions possibles (B\u00e9atrice Vizkelety, Proving Discrimination in Canada, Toronto, Carswell, 1987, \u00e0 la page 142. Voir aussi Khiamal c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), 2009 CF 495, au par. 60).\n[20] Ainsi, pour s\u2019acquitter de son fardeau, le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s (Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, au par. 67 [Bombardier]), qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de une ou des caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi, qu\u2019il a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 son emploi et que la ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es (appel\u00e9es \u00ab motifs de distinction illicite \u00bb dans la Loi) ont constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61, au par. 33).\n[21] Pour avoir gain de cause, le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son endroit, car, comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a fait remarquer dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bombardier, certains comportements discriminatoires sont multifactoriels ou inconscients (Bombardier, aux par. 40 et 41). L\u2019intention d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction ne devrait donc pas \u00eatre un facteur d\u00e9terminant. C\u2019est plut\u00f4t le r\u00e9sultat, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable, qui importe (Simpsons-Sears, aux par. 12, 14).\n[22] De plus, il n\u2019est pas essentiel que le lien entre le motif de distinction illicite et la d\u00e9cision reproch\u00e9e soit exclusif, ou qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019un lien causal, puisqu\u2019il suffit que le motif de distinction illicite ait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision ou la conduite reproch\u00e9e. En somme, la preuve doit \u00e9tablir que le motif de distinction illicite a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision contest\u00e9e (Bombardier, aux par. 45-52).\n[23] En outre, il suffit que la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant soit l\u2019un des facteurs qui ont jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de l\u2019affecter \u00e0 des fonctions administratives pendant cinq ans (A.B. c. Eazy Express Inc., 2014 TCDP 35 (CanLII), au par. 16).\n[24] Une fois la preuve prima facie de discrimination \u00e9tablie, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019employeur peut justifier sa d\u00e9cision en d\u00e9montrant, toujours selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019elle d\u00e9coule d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es aux termes de l\u2019article 15 de la Loi. Le fardeau de la preuve passe alors \u00e0 l\u2019employeur (Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396 (CanLII), au par. 67).\n[25] Les paragraphes 15(1) et 15(2) de la Loi sont ainsi libell\u00e9s :\n15(1) Ne constituent pas des actes discriminatoires :\na) les refus, exclusions, expulsions, suspensions, restrictions, conditions ou pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences de l\u2019employeur qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019ils d\u00e9coulent d\u2019exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es;\n[\u2026]\n15(2) Les faits pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)a) sont des exigences professionnelles justifi\u00e9es ou un motif justifiable, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (1)g), s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes vis\u00e9es constituent, pour la personne qui doit les prendre, une contrainte excessive en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[26] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9tabli un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets pour \u00e9tablir s\u2019il existe une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens des paragraphes 15(1) et 15(2) de la Loi. Le crit\u00e8re est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3 [Meiorin], au paragraphe 54 :\n54 Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les diverses possibilit\u00e9s qui s\u2019offrent, je propose d\u2019adopter la m\u00e9thode en trois \u00e9tapes qui suit pour d\u00e9terminer si une norme discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue est une [exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e]. L\u2019employeur peut justifier la norme contest\u00e9e en \u00e9tablissant selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s :\n(1) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause;\n(2) qu\u2019il a adopt\u00e9 la norme particuli\u00e8re en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail;\n(3) que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 au travail. Pour prouver que la norme est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, il faut d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est impossible de composer avec les employ\u00e9s qui ont les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que le demandeur sans que l\u2019employeur subisse une contrainte excessive.\n[27] Comme la Cour l\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada c. Kelly, 2011 CF 120 [Kelly], aux paragraphes 356 \u00e0 358 :\n356 Les premier et deuxi\u00e8me volets du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin exigent que l\u2019on \u00e9value la l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9 de l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la norme, ainsi que l\u2019intention qu\u2019avait l\u2019employeur au moment de l\u2019adopter. Cela a pour but de garantir que la norme, consid\u00e9r\u00e9e sur le plan aussi bien objectif que subjectif, ne comporte pas de fondement discriminatoire. Le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la norme est exig\u00e9e pour r\u00e9aliser un but l\u00e9gitime, et si l\u2019employeur peut composer avec la plainte sans subir une contrainte excessive : Centre universitaire de sant\u00e9 McGill c.

Syndicat des employ\u00e9-e-s de techniques professionnelles et de bureau d\u2019Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, section locale 2000 (SCFP-FTQ), 2008 CSC 43, [2008] 2 R.C.S. 561, l\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab impossible \u00bb en rapport avec le troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin suscite une certaine confusion. La Cour supr\u00eame a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que ce qui est exig\u00e9 \u00ab n\u2019est pas la d\u00e9monstration de l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 d\u2019int\u00e9grer un employ\u00e9 qui ne respecte pas une norme, mais bien la preuve d\u2019une contrainte excessive qui, elle, peut prendre autant de formes qu\u2019il y a de circonstances \u00bb : au paragraphe 12.\n358 Quant \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de l\u2019obligation d\u2019accommodement, la Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]\u2019employeur n\u2019a pas l\u2019obligation de modifier de fa\u00e7on fondamentale les conditions de travail, mais il a cependant l\u2019obligation d\u2019am\u00e9nager, si cela ne lui cause pas une contrainte excessive, le poste de travail ou les t\u00e2ches de l\u2019employ\u00e9 pour lui permettre de fournir sa prestation de travail \u00bb : Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec, au paragraphe 16.\n[28] De plus, dans un commentaire \u00e0 propos du paragraphe 15(2) de la Loi, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a affirm\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Kelly qu\u2019il faudrait consid\u00e9rer que cette disposition limite aux co\u00fbts, \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les facteurs dont il faut tenir compte dans le cadre d\u2019une analyse de l\u2019accommodement.\nV. Analyse\nA. Est-ce que le plaignant poss\u00e8de une ou des caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi?\n[29] Le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il ne fait aucun doute que le plaignant a une d\u00e9ficience au sens de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi.\n[30] En effet, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve au dossier et le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant et de son m\u00e9decin traitant, le Dr Diggle, nous permettent de conclure que le plaignant a fait plusieurs crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie (crises de grand mal) depuis 2005.\n[31] Les notes prises par le Dr Diggle lors de sa premi\u00e8re consultation avec le plaignant le 27 juillet 2010 indiquent que, en 2005, son \u00e9pouse de l\u2019\u00e9poque a remarqu\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019apparition subite de raideur des quatre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s la nuit, quand le patient dort, suivie de tremblements, de myalgie diffuse, d\u2019h\u00e9morragies p\u00e9t\u00e9chiales et de morsures de la langue \u00bb.\n[32] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le gendarme Desson a expliqu\u00e9 que, en 2008, lors d\u2019un voyage \u00e0 Las Vegas pour l\u2019enterrement de vie de gar\u00e7on d\u2019un ami, il avait consomm\u00e9 beaucoup d\u2019alcool et avait pass\u00e9 la majeure partie de la journ\u00e9e au soleil. L\u2019ami avec qui il partageait la chambre d\u2019h\u00f4tel lui a dit qu\u2019il l\u2019avait vu avoir des convulsions g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es, lesquelles sont d\u00e9crites par le Dr Singh, neurologue, dans son rapport du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2011.\n[33] Le Dr Diggle mentionne dans son rapport du 27 juillet 2010 que, le 8 mai 2010, le gendarme Desson a eu un autre \u00e9pisode alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait seul chez lui. Le gendarme Desson [traduction] \u00ab a soudainement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, est all\u00e9 regarder par la fen\u00eatre, puis s\u2019est mis \u00e0 \u201cfixer\u201d et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir une \u201cvision tubulaire\u201d. Son bras gauche s\u2019est mis \u00e0 trembler, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir une \u201cvision tubulaire\u201d, et lorsqu\u2019il est revenu \u00e0 lui, au moins une heure s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9e. Il avait une coupure au-dessus de l\u2019\u0153il droit. Il a eu besoin de points de suture, mais aucun m\u00e9dicament pour la prophylaxie des crises ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrit \u00bb.\n[34] Puis, il y a eu la crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019accident du 14 juillet 2010.\n[35] Le dossier du Tribunal contient \u00e9galement des certificats m\u00e9dicaux d\u00e9livr\u00e9s par la Dre Ellie Fasihy, m\u00e9decin traitant, apr\u00e8s le 14 juillet 2010, qui font \u00e9tat de crises.\n[36] Les r\u00e9sultats des examens paracliniques comme l\u2019\u00e9lectroenc\u00e9phalogramme (EEG) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9s anormaux; l\u2019EEG montrait des pointes dans la r\u00e9gion temporale ant\u00e9rieure gauche et la r\u00e9gion temporale moyenne compatibles avec de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle. C\u2019est le diagnostic confirm\u00e9 par le Dr Diggle. Dans son rapport concernant sa premi\u00e8re rencontre avec le gendarme Desson, le 27 juillet 2010, le Dr Diggle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] IMPRESSION\n\u00c9pilepsie partielle, avec pens\u00e9e forc\u00e9e et anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 comme sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019aura. Je soup\u00e7onne des \u00e9pisodes d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 ou des crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle, suivis de crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9es de type tonico-clonique. Je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019elles proviennent de la r\u00e9gion temporale gauche, compte tenu des pointes dans l\u2019EEG. Le principal diagnostic diff\u00e9rentiel serait une \u00e9pilepsie partielle de l\u2019h\u00e9misph\u00e8re droit, vu l\u2019engourdissement du bras gauche; des foyers bitemporaux sont aussi possibles, bien que cela soit rare.\n[37] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette preuve, le Tribunal conclut que le diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle constitue une d\u00e9ficience au sens de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi et un motif de distinction illicite au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e au titre de la Loi.\n[38] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question A est donc oui. Le gendarme Desson a une d\u00e9ficience au sens de l\u2019article 3 de la Loi.\nB. Si oui, le plaignant a-t-il subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 son emploi?\n[39] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que le gendarme Desson a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 son emploi.\n[40] En effet, en novembre 2010, soit d\u00e8s que le plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de retourner au travail apr\u00e8s la crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et l\u2019accident du 14 juillet 2010, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a chang\u00e9 son statut, lui retirant ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pour l\u2019affecter \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives.\n[41] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas faire d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, ou tr\u00e8s peu, pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, s\u2019il avait continu\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, il aurait accumul\u00e9 un nombre important d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et acquis une exp\u00e9rience qui aurait contribu\u00e9 grandement \u00e0 son avancement professionnel.\n[42] La preuve montre \u00e9galement que le salaire de base du plaignant ne d\u00e9pendait pas de savoir s\u2019il avait la cote O2 (t\u00e2ches normales), O4 (t\u00e2ches administratives) ou O6 (cong\u00e9 de maladie) (le syst\u00e8me de cotes sera expliqu\u00e9 plus loin). De fait, pendant toute la dur\u00e9e de son cong\u00e9 de maladie, soit de juillet 2010 \u00e0 mai 2015, date \u00e0 laquelle il a repris ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales au titre de la cat\u00e9gorie O2, son salaire de base est demeur\u00e9 le m\u00eame et il a continu\u00e9 de progresser dans l\u2019\u00e9chelle salariale.\n[43] Le t\u00e9moignage du plaignant est corrobor\u00e9 par ses avis de cotisation de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada et les talons de paye se rapportant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant mai 2015 et \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode suivant cette date. Il est \u00e9vident que, d\u00e8s qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, le plaignant a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ajouter des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00e0 sa semaine de travail normale, parfois jusqu\u2019\u00e0 20 ou 25 heures de plus par semaine, ce qui a consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9 son salaire.\n[44] Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettent de conclure que le plaignant a subi un pr\u00e9judice financier. Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter des autres pr\u00e9judices all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par le plaignant, par exemple les occasions manqu\u00e9es de promotion ou l\u2019effet psychologique important que la politique de cinq ans a eu sur lui.\n[45] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question B est donc oui. Le gendarme Desson a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[46] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement remarqu\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de sa perception de discrimination au cours de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans en question. Par exemple, la cause de l\u2019accident du 14 juillet 2010, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 une source de col\u00e8re et d\u2019humiliation pour lui. En outre, il a dit qu\u2019un coll\u00e8gue lui avait demand\u00e9 comment il allait dans la t\u00eate lorsqu\u2019il est revenu au travail en novembre 2010. Pour lui, c\u2019\u00e9tait humiliant que l\u2019on sache qu\u2019il avait eu une crise; c\u2019\u00e9tait une faiblesse personnelle dont il avait honte.\n[47] Le plaignant a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au poste de police de Burnaby, on affichait au mur la photo des gendarmes qui faisaient partie du d\u00e9tachement, mais qui \u00e9taient en cong\u00e9 de maladie de longue dur\u00e9e ou qui \u00e9taient absents pour d\u2019autres raisons. Pour lui, c\u2019\u00e9tait le [traduction] \u00ab mur de la honte \u00bb et il ne voulait pas que sa photo s\u2019y retrouve. Pendant son t\u00e9moignage, il a affirm\u00e9 que la conseill\u00e8re en perfectionnement et en renouvellement des ressources humaines, la sergente Cathy Shepherd, l\u2019avait rabaiss\u00e9 lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union en lui disant qu\u2019elle avait perdu son mari et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait remise sur pied, laissant entendre qu\u2019il devrait faire de m\u00eame. Il s\u2019est de nouveau senti humili\u00e9 et victime de discrimination. En outre, il a racont\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme l\u2019un des \u00e9pileptiques de la sergente Shepherd l\u2019avait beaucoup troubl\u00e9.\n[48] Le gendarme Desson a certes eu l\u2019impression qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de commentaires discriminatoires. Toutefois, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que ces commentaires aient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s par compassion, et qu\u2019une personne raisonnable les aurait per\u00e7us comme tels. Quant au \u00ab mur de la honte \u00bb, la perception du gendarme Desson pourrait d\u00e9couler de sa propre vision d\u00e9form\u00e9e de ses coll\u00e8gues en cong\u00e9. \u00c0 ce stade-ci, il n\u2019est pas utile d\u2019analyser les perceptions personnelles de chacun et la fa\u00e7on dont elles ont perturb\u00e9 le gendarme Desson. Cette analyse pourrait \u00eatre pertinente \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la r\u00e9paration, au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral.\nC. La ou les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es ont-elles \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de retirer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles au plaignant?\n[49] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que les crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et le diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle du gendarme Desson expliquent pourquoi il a \u00e9t\u00e9 assujetti \u00e0 la politique de cinq ans, qui l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pendant les cinq ann\u00e9es suivant sa derni\u00e8re crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie.\n[50] Il ne fait donc aucun doute que la politique appliqu\u00e9e au plaignant, par laquelle ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9es, lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice financier important, m\u00eame s\u2019il a conserv\u00e9 son salaire de base tout au long de la p\u00e9riode en question. En effet, il n\u2019a pas eu la possibilit\u00e9 de faire des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires et d\u2019\u00eatre r\u00e9mun\u00e9r\u00e9 en cons\u00e9quence.\n[51] C\u2019est en raison de la d\u00e9ficience du plaignant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e lui a retir\u00e9 ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, ce qui lui a caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice financier important. Par cons\u00e9quent, il existe un lien entre la d\u00e9ficience et l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable subi par le plaignant relativement \u00e0 son emploi.\n[52] La r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question C est donc oui, et il faut conclure que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la discrimination prima facie.\n[53] La question demeure de savoir si la d\u00e9cision d\u2019interdire au plaignant d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles entre juillet 2010 et mai 2015 constitue, comme le pr\u00e9tend la GRC, une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e. Cette question sera examin\u00e9e dans la prochaine section.\nD. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a-t-elle justifi\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision selon l\u2019article 15 de la Loi en \u00e9tablissant que la norme appliqu\u00e9e au gendarme Desson constituait une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e?\n[54] Bien que l\u2019interdiction d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles soit discriminatoire \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un acte discriminatoire si la GRC \u00e9tablit, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la politique de cinq ans emp\u00eachant le plaignant d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens des paragraphes 15(1) et 15(2) de la Loi. Pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019intim\u00e9e s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau de la preuve qui lui incombait, le Tribunal doit r\u00e9pondre aux questions suivantes :\nQuestion 1 : La politique de cinq ans a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause et est-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire?\nQuestion 2 : L\u2019employeur a-t-il adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime?\nQuestion 3 : L\u2019employeur a-t-il pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant au titre de la politique de cinq ans sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 subir une contrainte excessive?\n[55] Avant de r\u00e9pondre aux deux premi\u00e8res questions, le Tribunal juge n\u00e9cessaire de r\u00e9sumer les t\u00e2ches des gendarmes aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et d\u2019expliquer le syst\u00e8me de profil m\u00e9dical et la classification des restrictions professionnelles.\na) Les t\u00e2ches des gendarmes aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux\n[56] Les t\u00e2ches des gendarmes, comme M. Desson, sont d\u00e9crites dans le r\u00e9pertoire int\u00e9gr\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches des gendarmes aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux figurant dans un document d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme l\u2019annexe II-1-6. Elles comprennent les t\u00e2ches suivantes :\na. Poursuivre un suspect qui s\u2019enfuit, \u00e0 pied ou dans un v\u00e9hicule appropri\u00e9 (t\u00e2che 2.11);\nb.

La politique de cinq ans initiale indique que le profil O4 (fonctions non op\u00e9rationnelles) est attribu\u00e9 au membre qui se trouve dans cette situation. Si le membre a besoin de m\u00e9dicaments pour contr\u00f4ler les crises, il conserve la cote O4 pour le reste de sa carri\u00e8re. Si le membre ne prend pas de m\u00e9dicaments et n\u2019a pas eu de crise depuis cinq ans, la cote O2 (fonctions sans restriction) peut \u00eatre envisag\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, selon la politique \u00e9crite initiale, le membre qui aurait besoin de m\u00e9dicaments pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie, comme le gendarme Desson (la question sera trait\u00e9e plus loin), serait tenu de conserver la cote O4 (fonctions non op\u00e9rationnelles) pour le reste de sa carri\u00e8re.\n[62] Selon les t\u00e9moignages des Drs Ross, Johnson, Fieschi et Beaulieu, qui seront d\u00e9crits plus en d\u00e9tail ci-dessous, en 2010, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question d\u2019apporter un changement \u00e0 la politique, changement qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9 au gendarme Desson et qui lui a permis de reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles avant l\u2019expiration de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, m\u00eame s\u2019il prend des m\u00e9dicaments anticonvulsivants pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie. La politique \u00e9crite n\u2019a toujours pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en cons\u00e9quence.\n[63] Certaines des actions du plaignant ont peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9es par la politique \u00e9crite de 1995, mais c\u2019est la politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e qui s\u2019appliquait \u00e0 lui, qui autorise la reprise des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles apr\u00e8s cinq ans, m\u00eame si le membre prend encore des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[64] Comme le choix d\u2019appliquer la politique initiale ou la politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e n\u2019aurait \u00e0 aucun moment men\u00e9 \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent pour ce qui est de la capacit\u00e9 du gendarme Desson d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, le Tribunal concentrera la majeure partie de son analyse sur la politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e.\nQuestion 1 : La politique de cinq ans a-t-elle \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause et est-elle raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire?\n[65] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la politique de cinq ans initiale (tout comme la politique r\u00e9vis\u00e9e) a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause. De plus, la politique de cinq ans est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire.\n[66] Pour analyser la question, le Tribunal a tenu compte de l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la politique de cinq ans et de sa l\u00e9gitimit\u00e9, autrement dit ce que la politique est cens\u00e9e accomplir. Le Tribunal s\u2019est \u00e9galement pench\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si cet objet pourrait \u00eatre atteint par d\u2019autres moyens.\na) Les faits\n[67] La politique de cinq ans de l\u2019employeur est une politique particuli\u00e8re qui consiste \u00e0 affecter les agents de police souffrant d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives pendant cinq ans. Le document applicable est l\u2019annexe II-1-5, qui se rapporte aux affections du syst\u00e8me nerveux central. C\u2019est la politique qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e au gendarme Desson. La justification du profil est expliqu\u00e9e ainsi dans le document :\nLa classification correspondant \u00e0 telle ou telle pathologie du [syst\u00e8me nerveux central] n\u00e9cessite que l\u2019on identifie un \u00e9ventuel risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du sujet, de ses coll\u00e8gues ou du public. La classification est chose facile si une incapacit\u00e9 soudaine risque d\u2019appara\u00eetre. L\u2019effet d\u2019une paralysie est \u00e9vident. De m\u00eame, il est \u00e9vident que le jugement peut \u00eatre touch\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il existe des troubles instables de l\u2019affection. Il n\u2019y a pas de probl\u00e8me pour classer un sujet lorsqu\u2019il souffre de troubles cognitifs gravissimes, mais cela peut \u00eatre difficile lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019existe qu\u2019une l\u00e9g\u00e8re d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration des fonctions sup\u00e9rieures. En effet, la limite entre une insuffisance dans l\u2019accomplissement professionnel et une invalidit\u00e9 d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical n\u2019est pas nette dans ce cas.\nL\u2019ouvrage intitul\u00e9 : \u00ab Examen du conducteur - Guide du m\u00e9decin \u00bb de l\u2019Association M\u00e9dicale Canadienne peut aider \u00e0 choisir une classification quant \u00e0 la conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule. En effet, celle-ci fait vraiment partie int\u00e9grante du travail policier. Pour conduire un v\u00e9hicule de police, il faut un permis de classe 4. Toutefois, ce n\u2019est pas la seule fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019apparition d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 soudaine peut compromettre la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public. On n\u2019a pas besoin de tenir compte de l\u2019existence \u00e9ventuelle de convulsions f\u00e9briles dans la petite enfance du sujet, ni de celle d\u2019une crise \u00e9pileptique \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une intoxication, \u00e0 condition que le sujet soit compl\u00e8tement gu\u00e9ri. Si le sujet pr\u00e9sente une crise \u00e9pileptique spontan\u00e9e, il faudrait lui faire un bilan neurologique. On peut annuler toutes limitations \u00e9ventuelles chez un sujet qui, en l\u2019absence de prise m\u00e9dicamenteuse, n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de crise \u00e9pileptique depuis douze mois et chez qui l\u2019on n\u2019a pas pu mettre en \u00e9vidence de foyer \u00e9pileptiforme. Avant la fin du douzi\u00e8me mois, il convient de choisir une classifica[tion] G2 \u00e0 G4, O4.\nOn choisit une classification O4 lorsque le diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie est \u00e9tabli ou lorsque le sujet a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au moins deux crises. Lorsqu\u2019il prend un traitement anticonvulsivant, sa classification reste O4. On peut choisir O2 pour le sujet qui, en l\u2019absence de toute prise m\u00e9dicamenteuse, est asymptomatique depuis cinq ans. O2 ou O3 peut convenir pour un sujet qui, depuis cinq ans au moins, ne pr\u00e9sente des crises que lorsqu\u2019il dort ou imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s son r\u00e9veil et qui ne pr\u00e9sente pas d\u2019anomalies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9lectroenc\u00e9phalogramme de l\u2019\u00e9veil. Avant d\u2019annuler les restrictions professionnelles pour le sujet qui a b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une intervention chirurgicale curative, l\u2019on doit s\u2019assurer qu\u2019il ne pr\u00e9sente plus de crises depuis cinq ans au moins sans traitement m\u00e9dicamenteux.\nOn consid\u00e8re les \u00e9pisodes de syncope r\u00e9cidivants qui ne sont pas expliqu\u00e9s de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les troubles convulsifs.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[68] La politique de cinq ans (annexe II-1 55) d\u00e9crit la relation entre les affections g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du syst\u00e8me nerveux central et les t\u00e2ches des membres :\nLa pathologie du [syst\u00e8me nerveux central] peut compromettre le travail policier de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons : l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie risque de faire appara\u00eetre une incapacit\u00e9 soudaine; la maladie d\u2019Alzheimer [\u2026] Ce sont les effets de la maladie qui d\u00e9terminent son impact sur le travail policier.\nPremi\u00e8re crise de convulsion \u00e9pileptiforme\nLorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de t\u00e9moin(s) d\u2019\u00e9pisode de crise et lorsque le sujet nie sa maladie, le d\u00e9pistage clinique d\u2019une \u00e9pilepsie est impossible. Cette pathologie s\u2019accompagne toutefois du risque d\u2019apparition d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 soudaine. L\u2019apparition d\u2019une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9sastreuses si elle survenait \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une chasse-poursuite en voiture ou d\u2019une autre situation o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public est en jeu. On doit soumettre le sujet \u00e0 risque \u00e0 des restrictions professionnelles pour garantir la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public. Les principales t\u00e2ches \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer ici sont les suivantes : 2.11, 2.12, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 7.2, 7.4 et 7.7 [ces t\u00e2ches sont d\u00e9crites au paragraphe 56 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision]. Il faut \u00e9galement penser aux cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019aurait une absence soudaine du sujet pendant son travail, et non seulement aux \u00e9ventuelles cons\u00e9quences directes d\u2019une crise \u00e9pileptique.\n[69] Deuxi\u00e8me crise de convulsion \u00e9pileptiforme :\nL\u2019on peut consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019un sujet est \u00e9pileptique lorsqu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 deux crises de fa\u00e7on spontan\u00e9e; par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019on ne doit pas affecter ce sujet dans un poste o\u00f9 l\u2019apparition soudaine de son incapacit\u00e9 peut mettre en p\u00e9ril la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du public. Si la crise est li\u00e9e \u00e0 un autre type de pathologie, il faut d\u00e9terminer si celle-ci peut \u00eatre gu\u00e9rie et quelles seront ses s\u00e9quelles avant de pr\u00e9voir une dur\u00e9e pour les mesures restrictives quant \u00e0 l\u2019emploi.\n[70] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la justification exprim\u00e9e dans la politique \u00e9crite se rapporte au risque que pose pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du membre, de ses coll\u00e8gues et du public l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine associ\u00e9e au trouble. La politique de cinq ans est en partie inspir\u00e9e du guide de l\u2019Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne portant sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 conduire, puisque la conduite automobile fait partie int\u00e9grante du travail policier.\n[71] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve incluent \u00e9galement un document du Conseil canadien des administrateurs en transport motoris\u00e9 (CCATM) qui comprend les normes m\u00e9dicales pour les conducteurs ayant divers probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9, notamment ceux qui souffrent de crises et d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie (chapitre 17).\n[72] Le plaignant fait valoir que la section du document du CCATM sur la conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule commercial n\u2019est pas pertinente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car la GRC n\u2019exige pas que ses gendarmes d\u00e9tiennent un permis de conduire commercial (taxis, limousines, ambulances) (classe 4 en Colombie-Britannique). Elle exige seulement qu\u2019ils d\u00e9tiennent un permis de conduire non commercial (classe 5 en Colombie-Britannique).\n[73] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la section du document du CCATM sur la conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule commercial est, au contraire, tr\u00e8s pertinente. M\u00eame si la GRC n\u2019exige pas le permis de conduire de classe 4, le risque associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont un agent de police doit conduire lors du d\u00e9clenchement d\u2019un code 3 ressemble davantage au risque associ\u00e9 aux conducteurs de v\u00e9hicules commerciaux, par exemple une ambulance, voire est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9. En effet, la preuve montre que l\u2019agent de police qui doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un code 3 peut \u00eatre appel\u00e9 \u00e0 mener une poursuite polici\u00e8re, tout en demeurant en contact avec le service de r\u00e9partition et en essayant de lire une plaque d\u2019immatriculation ou de v\u00e9rifier si le conducteur a un casier judiciaire. Les agents de police peuvent rouler jusqu\u2019\u00e0 240 km\/h lors d\u2019une poursuite polici\u00e8re. Les exigences cognitives n\u00e9cessaires lors d\u2019une poursuite polici\u00e8re sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9es et diff\u00e8rent largement de ce qu\u2019exige la conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule non commercial. Par cons\u00e9quent, les lignes directrices du CCATM pour les conducteurs de v\u00e9hicules commerciaux sont pertinentes dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[74] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement accept\u00e9 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en raison de la fiabilit\u00e9 du document. En effet, le CCATM est un organisme form\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sentants des gouvernements f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, provinciaux et territoriaux du Canada qui, au moyen d\u2019un processus consultatif collectif, prend des d\u00e9cisions au sujet de certains aspects administratifs et op\u00e9rationnels li\u00e9s \u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance de permis, \u00e0 l\u2019immatriculation, \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation du transport routier et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re.\n[75] Le chapitre 17 traite des crises et de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, de leur pr\u00e9valence, de leurs r\u00e9percussions sur la conduite, de leur incidence sur la capacit\u00e9 fonctionnelle \u00e0 conduire et de la compensation et donne des lignes directrices pour l\u2019\u00e9valuation.\n[76] Il indique entre autres :\n[traduction] La principale pr\u00e9occupation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des conducteurs \u00e9pileptiques est le risque qu\u2019une crise provoque une alt\u00e9ration soudaine des fonctions cognitives, motrices ou sensorielles ou une perte de conscience au volant.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[77] Il pr\u00e9voit aussi ce qui suit :\n[traduction] On estime que le risque de r\u00e9currence apr\u00e8s une premi\u00e8re crise non provoqu\u00e9e varie de 2,3 \u00e0 71 %, le risque moyen chez les adultes s\u2019\u00e9tablissant \u00e0 43 %. Si la crise est de cause inconnue et que l\u2019EEG du patient n\u2019a enregistr\u00e9 aucune activit\u00e9 anormale, ce risque est r\u00e9duit. Le risque de r\u00e9currence est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 chez les personnes qui sont victimes d\u2019une crise partielle et dont l\u2019EEG montre une activit\u00e9 anormale ou qui sont atteintes d\u2019une autre anomalie neurologique. Les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie augmentent \u00e9galement le risque de r\u00e9currence.\n[78] Le CCATM ajoute que les lignes directrices applicables aux conducteurs qui souffrent d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie ou de crises partent du principe que [traduction] \u00ab les crises doivent \u00eatre sous contr\u00f4le avant que le conducteur puisse reprendre la roue \u00bb. La plupart des lignes directrices exigent qu\u2019il se soit \u00e9coul\u00e9 une certaine p\u00e9riode sans crise. Cette exigence applicable aux crises non provoqu\u00e9es vise \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab prendre le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019origine des crises et, si un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie est \u00e9tabli, s\u2019assurer que la bonne dose de m\u00e9dicament a \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9e, que le m\u00e9dicament emp\u00eache la survenue de nouvelles crises et que le conducteur ne ressent pas d\u2019effets secondaires qui pourraient nuire \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de conduire en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9. \u00bb (Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[79] Le CCATM indique que le conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule commercial qui est \u00e9pileptique peut obtenir un permis s\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9cout\u00e9 cinq ans depuis sa derni\u00e8re crise, qu\u2019il prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments, et que les conditions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conservation du permis sont remplies (c.-\u00e0-d. qu\u2019il doit suivre le traitement prescrit et les conseils de son m\u00e9decin pour pr\u00e9venir les crises et, en cas de crise, arr\u00eater de conduire et en aviser les autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes et son m\u00e9decin).\n[80] Le conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule non commercial qui est \u00e9pileptique peut pour sa part obtenir un permis s\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 six mois depuis sa derni\u00e8re crise, qu\u2019il prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments, et que les conditions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conservation du permis sont remplies.\n[81] En cas de changement de m\u00e9dicaments, le conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule commercial peut obtenir un permis s\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 six mois depuis qu\u2019il a chang\u00e9 de m\u00e9dicaments ou cess\u00e9 de prendre des m\u00e9dicaments, qu\u2019il n\u2019a eu aucune crise pendant cette p\u00e9riode et que les conditions li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conservation du permis sont remplies. Pour le conducteur d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule non commercial dans les m\u00eames conditions, la p\u00e9riode est de trois mois.\n[82] La Dre Naomi Ross occupait \u00e0 temps plein le poste de m\u00e9decin-chef, sp\u00e9cialiste des emplois, pour la GRC durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte. Son r\u00f4le consistait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l\u2019aptitude au travail des membres, \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les dossiers d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 et \u00e0 \u00e9valuer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 des membres dans la r\u00e9gion de la Colombie-Britannique. Elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elle a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un courriel envoy\u00e9 le 11 d\u00e9cembre 2013 \u00e0 Jeff Hurry, officier responsable des Services de sant\u00e9 de la GRC, et \u00e0 Patti Parker, infirmi\u00e8re en sant\u00e9 au travail, qui indiquait que la politique de cinq ans appliqu\u00e9e au gendarme Desson \u00e9tait conforme aux lignes directrices sur l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 conduire dans d\u2019autres industries critiques sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[83] La Dre Ross a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la politique de cinq ans de la GRC avait \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 1995 et qu\u2019elle avait appris, en d\u00e9cembre 2010, apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 au Dr Marc-Andr\u00e9 Beaulieu, neurologue sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9 en \u00e9pilepsie et conseiller national en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 de la GRC, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en cours de r\u00e9vision et que la restriction selon laquelle il fallait avoir cess\u00e9 de prendre des m\u00e9dicaments avant de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles allait \u00eatre supprim\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la politique de cinq ans refl\u00e9tait les lignes directrices de l\u2019Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 conduire, qui \u00e9taient plut\u00f4t r\u00e9centes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es en 2009. Selon elle, la politique de cinq ans ressemblait aussi au Manuel du r\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer et au guide de l\u2019American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine applicable aux agents d\u2019application de la loi.\n[84] La Dre Ross a parl\u00e9 du risque d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine pour les agents de police. \u00c0 titre d\u2019exemple, elle a mentionn\u00e9 que le membre pouvait se blesser s\u2019il \u00e9tait seul au moment d\u2019une confrontation avec un d\u00e9linquant violent et que ses coll\u00e8gues pourraient alors \u00eatre oblig\u00e9s de choisir entre s\u2019occuper de leur coll\u00e8gue ou intervenir dans la situation critique et prot\u00e9ger le public. Une telle situation pourrait entra\u00eener des cons\u00e9quences catastrophiques.\n[85] La Dre Ross a ajout\u00e9 que la conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule commercial est une activit\u00e9 \u00e0 risque \u00e9lev\u00e9, le risque \u00e9tant semblable \u00e0 celui que pr\u00e9sente l\u2019agent de police qui doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 un code 3 (conduite \u00e0 grande vitesse avec la sir\u00e8ne actionn\u00e9e), de sorte que la comparaison avec les lignes directrices de l\u2019Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne qui portent sur l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019aptitude \u00e0 conduire est appropri\u00e9e.\n[86] Dans ses commentaires concernant le rapport sur la prophylaxie des crises pr\u00e9par\u00e9 par le Dr Diggle le 27 juillet 2010, qui indique que la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9currence des crises s\u2019\u00e9tablit \u00e0 98 % sans m\u00e9dication, compte tenu du fait que le gendarme Desson avait fait quatre crises par le pass\u00e9, la Dre Ross a mentionn\u00e9 que la GRC tol\u00e9rait un risque d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine de 1 % et que le risque diminuait \u00e0 ce niveau cinq ans apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re crise. Le fait que les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019EEG du gendarme Desson \u00e9taient anormaux et confirmaient le diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie augmentait le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises. La Dre Ross a recommand\u00e9 que la cote O4 (t\u00e2ches administratives) soit attribu\u00e9e au gendarme Desson.\n[87] La Dre Ross a ajout\u00e9 que, si une personne occupant des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles devait changer de m\u00e9dicaments, il lui serait interdit d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pendant six mois. En outre, elle a indiqu\u00e9 que les guides de l\u2019Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne, le Manuel du r\u00e8glement m\u00e9dical des chemins de fer et les guides de l\u2019American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine applicables aux agents d\u2019application de la loi pr\u00e9voient la m\u00eame r\u00e8gle.\n[88] La Dre Krista Johnson \u00e9tait elle aussi m\u00e9decin-chef aux Services de sant\u00e9 de la GRC durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 responsable du dossier du gendarme Desson de mai 2011 \u00e0 septembre 2012, apr\u00e8s quoi, la Dre Ross a repris le dossier. Le r\u00f4le de la Dre Johnson consistait entre autres \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l\u2019aptitude au travail des agents de la GRC. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le risque de r\u00e9currence pour une personne souffrant d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie \u00e9tait plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans les cinq premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es suivant la crise. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait cess\u00e9 de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments, de sorte qu\u2019il fallait recommencer le calcul de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans sans fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles et que celle-ci aurait donc pris fin le 27 juin 2017. Le fait d\u2019arr\u00eater de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments aurait eu pour effet de repartir le compteur \u00e0 z\u00e9ro et augmentait le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises.\n[89] La Dre Isabelle Fieschi, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des Dres Ross et Johnson, \u00e9tait m\u00e9decin-chef \u00e0 la GRC. Elle est intervenue dans le dossier de M. Desson en 2014 et en 2015. D\u2019apr\u00e8s son t\u00e9moignage, au moment de d\u00e9terminer le statut op\u00e9rationnel d\u2019une personne, il faut tenir compte du risque d\u2019intervention inad\u00e9quate dans une situation d\u2019urgence. Une crise peut entra\u00eener une perte de conscience et peut \u00eatre tr\u00e8s dangereuse. La confusion postcritique et l\u2019alt\u00e9ration des facult\u00e9s pourraient nuire \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution s\u00e9curitaire des fonctions polici\u00e8res. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que les donn\u00e9es montrent que le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises diminue progressivement avec le temps. Apr\u00e8s cinq ans, le risque est r\u00e9duit \u00e0 un niveau acceptable, soit le m\u00eame qu\u2019une personne qui n\u2019a jamais souffert d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qu\u2019elle comprend, un agent de police ne peut pas exercer de fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pendant six mois \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un changement de m\u00e9dicaments. Contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019a affirm\u00e9 la Dre Johnson lors de son t\u00e9moignage, la Dre Fieschi a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait de changer de m\u00e9dicament pouvait prolonger la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans, mais ne repartait pas le compteur \u00e0 z\u00e9ro. Par cons\u00e9quent, le compteur ne repart pas \u00e0 z\u00e9ro apr\u00e8s un changement de m\u00e9dicaments. Dans les faits, le compteur n\u2019est pas reparti \u00e0 z\u00e9ro quand le gendarme Desson a cess\u00e9 de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments pendant un certain temps.\n[90] Le Dr Marc-Andr\u00e9 Beaulieu est neurologue et sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Durant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la plainte, il \u00e9tait conseiller national en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 pour la GRC. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le retrait, pendant cinq ans, des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles des agents de police ayant fait au moins deux crises s\u2019explique par le risque d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine et de confusion postcritique provoqu\u00e9 par la maladie et par le fait que les agents de police effectuent un travail essentiel \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Il a expliqu\u00e9 les risques associ\u00e9s \u00e0 la survenue d\u2019une crise au volant, surtout pour un agent de police. Dans le cas d\u2019une poursuite ou d\u2019un code 3, une crise pourrait avoir des cons\u00e9quences graves. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le fait qu\u2019un agent de police soit frapp\u00e9 d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 pendant une altercation physique avec un suspect dans le contexte d\u2019une arrestation pourrait \u00e9galement \u00eatre catastrophique pour l\u2019agent et le public. De plus, le fait que les agents de police portent une arme \u00e0 feu pose des risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en cas d\u2019incapacit\u00e9. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il existe des risques non seulement pendant l\u2019incapacit\u00e9, mais aussi apr\u00e8s celle-ci, lorsque la personne est totalement confuse. Il a aussi indiqu\u00e9 que les agents de police doivent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s alertes, parce qu\u2019ils sont appel\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre rapidement des d\u00e9cisions critiques, notamment la d\u00e9cision de lutter ou de fuir.\n[91] Le Dr Beaulieu a expliqu\u00e9 que le risque d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine diminue avec le temps en l\u2019absence d\u2019autres crises. Apr\u00e8s un an, le risque de r\u00e9currence pour la personne qui a eu au moins deux crises est de 73 %; apr\u00e8s trois ans, il chute \u00e0 8 %; apr\u00e8s quatre ans, il est de 5 %; apr\u00e8s cinq ans, il est de 3 %; et au d\u00e9but de la sixi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e, il s\u2019\u00e9tablit \u00e0 1 ou 2 %. Par cons\u00e9quent, lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 cinq ans depuis la derni\u00e8re crise, le risque de r\u00e9currence tombe \u00e0 un niveau acceptable (1 ou 2 %), que la personne prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments. La politique de cinq ans initiale permettait \u00e0 une personne \u00e9pileptique de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles s\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9 cinq ans depuis la derni\u00e8re crise et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas besoin de m\u00e9dicaments. Si la personne devait prendre des m\u00e9dicaments, la personne \u00e9tait affect\u00e9e \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives pour le reste de sa carri\u00e8re. Cette restriction a \u00e9t\u00e9 abolie au cours de l\u2019exercice 2010-2011, de sorte qu\u2019une personne peut r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles apr\u00e8s cinq ans, qu\u2019elle prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments.\n[92] Le Dr Beaulieu a expliqu\u00e9 que la GRC avait adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans et l\u2019avait r\u00e9vis\u00e9e apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 d\u2019autres politiques. Il a ajout\u00e9 que la GRC, en tant qu\u2019organisation polici\u00e8re, n\u2019a pas les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour refaire le travail des principaux organismes de r\u00e9glementation. Elle s\u2019est donc bas\u00e9e sur les politiques existantes \u00e0 titre de pratiques exemplaires. Elle a pris en consid\u00e9ration les politiques de l\u2019Association m\u00e9dicale canadienne et des organismes de r\u00e9glementation dans d\u2019autres industries critiques sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, comme le CCATM, qui exige que les conducteurs de v\u00e9hicules commerciaux ayant re\u00e7u un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie n\u2019aient pas fait de crises pendant cinq ans, qu\u2019ils prennent ou non des m\u00e9dicaments, avant de reprendre la roue. Le Dr Beaulieu a indiqu\u00e9 que la GRC s\u2019\u00e9tait aussi inspir\u00e9e d\u2019autres politiques, comme les lignes directrices sur la conduite du Canadien National. Il a \u00e9galement fait remarquer que d\u2019autres services de police, comme la Police provinciale de l\u2019Ontario, ont une politique semblable \u00e0 la politique de cinq ans. Il a ajout\u00e9 que dans d\u2019autres pays, comme l\u2019Australie, le Royaume-Uni et les \u00c9tats\u2011Unis, et en Europe, l\u2019interdiction de conduire un v\u00e9hicule commercial est de dix ans et il est parfois exig\u00e9 que le conducteur ne prenne pas de m\u00e9dicaments.\n[93] Le Dr John Diggle, neurologue et sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, a \u00e9t\u00e9 le m\u00e9decin traitant du gendarme Desson de 2010 \u00e0 2016. Dans son rapport du 27 juillet 2010, il a \u00e9crit que le gendarme Desson avait eu quatre crises par le pass\u00e9 et que son risque de r\u00e9currence des crises \u00e9tait de 98 %. Il lui a donc prescrit un m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant, le T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol.\n[94] Le Dr Diggle a souscrit un affidavit et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il a expliqu\u00e9 ainsi le risque de r\u00e9currence de 98 % :\n[traduction] Le calcul est bas\u00e9 sur des donn\u00e9es globales bien connues provenant de la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale, qui fournit des statistiques sur le taux de r\u00e9currence des crises chez les personnes ayant re\u00e7u un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. D\u2019autres neurologues au courant de ces donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales pourraient conclure que le risque est aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que 100 % ou \u00eatre aussi faible que 90 %. Les m\u00eames donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales m\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que M. Desson a 85 % de chances d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des crises \u00bb, c.-\u00e0-d. de ne plus faire de crises, s\u2019il prend un seul m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant ind\u00e9finiment.\n[95] Le Dr Diggle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Les donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019environ 15 % des patients qui souffrent d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, comme le gendarme Desson, auront une autre crise m\u00eame s\u2019ils prennent un m\u00e9dicament. \u00bb En contre-interrogatoire, le Dr Diggle a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle une crise soudaine, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire une crise qui survient alors que le patient prend un m\u00e9dicament. Certains patients auront besoin de prendre deux m\u00e9dicaments; d\u2019autres auront besoin d\u2019en prendre trois, et [traduction] \u00ab un petit pourcentage de patients souffrant d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie n\u2019arriveront jamais \u00e0 se lib\u00e9rer des crises, peu importe les m\u00e9dicaments prescrits \u00bb.\n[96] Le Dr Diggle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab le risque de r\u00e9currence ne peut pas \u00eatre individualis\u00e9 et est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 pour tous les patients qui re\u00e7oivent un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Seul le passage du temps sans r\u00e9currence des crises permettra de savoir si un patient tombe dans les 85 % de patients qui prennent un seul m\u00e9dicament et qui ne font pas d\u2019autres crises ou dans les 15 % de patients qui subiront d\u2019autres crises \u00bb. Son point de vue \u00e9tait principalement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019aspect clinique, c.-\u00e0-d. \u00e0 la question de savoir s\u2019il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire de prendre un ou deux ou trois m\u00e9dicaments pour \u00e9viter la r\u00e9currence des crises.\n[97] Il a expliqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises chez les patients \u00e9pileptiques comme M. Desson est plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 juste apr\u00e8s une crise. \u00c0 mesure que le temps passe sans qu\u2019il y ait d\u2019autres crises, le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises du patient diminue. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des faits, compte tenu de la situation de M. Desson, de son profil m\u00e9dical et de ma connaissance des statistiques fournies dans la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale, j\u2019aurais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tr\u00e8s faible le risque que M. Desson ait une autre crise s\u2019il prenait des m\u00e9dicaments et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de crises depuis trois \u00e0 cinq ans.\n[98] Le Dr Diggle a expliqu\u00e9 que le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises est le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 au cours des six premiers mois suivant la crise, puis il diminue de fa\u00e7on exponentielle tout au long de la vie du patient. Ainsi, plus le temps passe depuis la derni\u00e8re crise, moins le patient est susceptible d\u2019avoir une crise soudaine. Les personnes qui prennent des m\u00e9dicaments ont un tr\u00e8s faible risque de r\u00e9currence des crises apr\u00e8s trois et cinq ans si elles n\u2019ont pas eu de crises pendant cette p\u00e9riode.\n[99] En outre, le Dr Diggle a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas rare que les personnes \u00e9pileptiques soient confuses et d\u00e9sorient\u00e9es apr\u00e8s une crise et qu\u2019elles peuvent \u00e9galement souffrir de d\u00e9faillances cognitives temporaires pendant un certain temps (pendant des heures, voire des jours), par exemple des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019attention ou de concentration, des probl\u00e8mes de m\u00e9moire \u00e0 court terme et une amn\u00e9sie r\u00e9trograde li\u00e9e \u00e0 une certaine p\u00e9riode (quelques heures, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une journ\u00e9e ou plus dans des cas rares).\n[100] Le Dr Diggle n\u2019a pas comment\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans, affirmant qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas en mesure d\u2019approuver ou d\u2019appuyer ni de nier ou de r\u00e9futer des lignes directrices internes. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que dans le cas d\u2019un pilote d\u2019avion qui fait une crise, c\u2019est la f\u00e9d\u00e9ration d\u2019administration de l\u2019aviation qui conna\u00eet la tol\u00e9rance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du risque. Le principe est le m\u00eame pour la politique de la GRC.\n[101] Le gendarme Desson a admis que l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine d\u2019un agent de police posait un risque pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, entre autres \u00e0 cause du risque d\u2019\u00eatre d\u00e9sarm\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que le code 3 signifie que l\u2019agent de police conduit avec la sir\u00e8ne actionn\u00e9e, ne respecte pas le code de la route et d\u00e9passe la limite de vitesse, tout en conduisant de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9fensive, en communiquant par radio avec le service de r\u00e9partition, en lisant la plaque d\u2019immatriculation, en demandant au service de r\u00e9partition si la personne poursuivie a un casier judiciaire, etc. Dans ces circonstances, le niveau de stress de l\u2019agent de police est assez \u00e9lev\u00e9. Selon le gendarme Desson, ce type de conduite est diff\u00e9rent et plus risqu\u00e9 que la conduite d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule commercial ou personnel.\n[102] De plus, le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait fait des recherches et qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9couvert que, selon la politique du service de police d\u2019Edmonton, il est interdit aux agents de police ayant eu une crise d\u2019exercer leurs fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pendant une p\u00e9riode de dix ans apr\u00e8s la derni\u00e8re crise, dont cinq ans sans la prise de m\u00e9dicaments. Au service de police de Toronto, l\u2019interdiction dure cinq ans, que l\u2019agent de police prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments.\nb) Analyse\n[103] Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal est convaincu que la preuve d\u00e9montre que le travail des agents de police est critique sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Le r\u00f4le des agents de police, tel qu\u2019il est d\u00e9crit dans le r\u00e9pertoire int\u00e9gr\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches des gendarmes aux services g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, consiste essentiellement \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger le public. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, les agents de police peuvent \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 poursuivre, \u00e0 arr\u00eater et \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser un suspect qui s\u2019enfuit ou qui r\u00e9siste ou une personne violente ou d\u00e9s\u00e9quilibr\u00e9e; \u00e0 patrouiller dans des zones \u00e0 criminalit\u00e9 \u00e9lev\u00e9e; \u00e0 pr\u00eater assistance \u00e0 une personne malade, bless\u00e9e ou en train de se noyer; \u00e0 retrouver une personne perdue, d\u00e9sorient\u00e9e ou en fugue; \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux demandes d\u2019aide d\u2019ordre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral; \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 routi\u00e8re en arr\u00eatant les contrevenants ou en les poursuivant et en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 leur arrestation.\n[104] Ces t\u00e2ches pr\u00e9cises illustrent la nature cruciale, sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, du travail des agents de police.\n[105] Deuxi\u00e8mement, le Tribunal accepte, compte tenu de la preuve, que la politique de cinq ans est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 son objectif visant \u00e0 assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du membre, de ses coll\u00e8gues et du public. En effet, la preuve fournie par deux neurologues sp\u00e9cialistes de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, les Drs Diggle et Beaulieu, ainsi que par les Dres Ross, Johnson et Fieschi, m\u00e9decins-chefs \u00e0 la GRC, d\u00e9montre bien le risque d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 et le risque li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat postcritique chez une personne \u00e9pileptique. En outre, le document du CCATM explique le risque d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine pendant la conduite de v\u00e9hicule, qui constitue un aspect important du travail des agents de la GRC.\n[106] M\u00eame M. Desson a admis qu\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 soudaine, qui surviendrait par exemple pendant une altercation avec un suspect, pourrait \u00eatre extr\u00eamement dangereuse pour le membre, ses coll\u00e8gues et le public.\n[107] Le Tribunal estime probant le fait que, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans le document du CCATM, les crises doivent \u00eatre sous contr\u00f4le avant qu\u2019une personne puisse reprendre la roue. Pour que les crises soient sous contr\u00f4le, il doit s\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9coul\u00e9 une certaine p\u00e9riode depuis la derni\u00e8re crise.\n[108] La p\u00e9riode de cinq ans pendant laquelle les fonctions des agents de police sont limit\u00e9es aux t\u00e2ches administratives est \u00e9galement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause, car le risque diminue avec le temps, en l\u2019absence de nouvelles crises et lorsque le patient suit les conseils de son m\u00e9decin pour ce qui est de la prise de m\u00e9dicaments. Dans le cas d\u2019une personne \u00e9pileptique, la preuve montre que, apr\u00e8s une crise, le risque de r\u00e9currence diminue \u00e0 15 % si le patient prend ses m\u00e9dicaments, puis tombe \u00e0 2 ou 3 % apr\u00e8s 3 \u00e0 5 ans ou m\u00eame \u00e0 1 % apr\u00e8s 5 ans.\n[109] Les Drs Ross, Johnson, Fieschi, Diggle et Beaulieu sont tous du m\u00eame avis : apr\u00e8s 5 ans, le risque de r\u00e9currence est de 1 %.\n[110] La GRC a choisi d\u2019accepter un risque de 1 %. Cette d\u00e9cision est compatible avec celles d\u2019autres pays qui ont adopt\u00e9 des politiques similaires dans le m\u00eame but. Certaines politiques sont plus restrictives et pr\u00e9voient une p\u00e9riode de dix ans.\n[111] La preuve montre que la politique de cinq ans est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 la nature cruciale du travail policier sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[112] Le Tribunal ajoute qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve contradictoire ne donne \u00e0 penser que le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises diminue \u00e0 1 % avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode de 5 ans. De plus, rien n\u2019indique que le seuil de risque de r\u00e9currence de 1 % adopt\u00e9 par la GRC est d\u00e9raisonnablement bas.\n[113] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re \u00e9galement que la politique de cinq ans est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause. La m\u00eame preuve sur les risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u00e9montre que la politique de cinq ans est rationnellement li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause et qu\u2019elle est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour maintenir des normes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 appropri\u00e9es pour les agents de la GRC. La preuve montre que le fait pour un agent de police d\u2019avoir une crise pendant qu\u2019il est de service pose un risque pour l\u2019agent, ses coll\u00e8gues et le public.\n[114] La politique de cinq ans n\u2019emp\u00eache les membres d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles que lorsque le risque d\u00e9passe un certain seuil, qui est d\u2019environ 1 %. Le Tribunal accepte que la GRC a le droit de choisir le niveau de risque qu\u2019elle est pr\u00eate \u00e0 accepter et que ce niveau est raisonnable compte tenu des cons\u00e9quences tr\u00e8s graves que pourrait entra\u00eener le fait d\u2019avoir une crise dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel. La politique de cinq ans tient bien compte de ce risque, en pr\u00e9voyant des restrictions adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 la situation personnelle du membre et fond\u00e9es sur les connaissances m\u00e9dicales. En effet, elle limite la restriction de cinq ans aux personnes dont les crises ne sont pas caus\u00e9es par un d\u00e9clencheur, signe que le risque de r\u00e9currence est faible. De plus, la restriction de cinq ans ne peut pas \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e davantage au risque que pose un agent, car aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019\u00e9valuer avec pr\u00e9cision si un agent de police particulier pr\u00e9sente un risque de r\u00e9currence plus faible.\n[115] N\u00e9anmoins, la preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que la politique de cinq ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e avec souplesse, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 tenir compte de la situation personnelle des membres. M\u00eame si la politique \u00e9crite initiale n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e, les experts m\u00e9dicaux qui appliquent la politique ont admis qu\u2019une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans sans crise \u00e9tait suffisante, m\u00eame si l\u2019agent de police prenait des m\u00e9dicaments anticonvulsivants pendant cette p\u00e9riode. De plus, comme nous le verrons, le gendarme Desson a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 individuellement et a \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9int\u00e9grer pleinement ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles un peu avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. Comme en t\u00e9moignent \u00e9galement la note du 29 d\u00e9cembre 2014 de la Dre Fieschi au sujet de la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer pleinement ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles apr\u00e8s trois ans et l\u2019examen du comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs du 13 f\u00e9vrier 2014, la politique permettait \u00e0 la GRC de tenir compte de la situation m\u00e9dicale personnelle des agents.\n[116] La politique de cinq ans est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire, parce qu\u2019elle est n\u00e9cessaire pour g\u00e9rer le risque grave pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 que pr\u00e9sente un agent frapp\u00e9 d\u2019une incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une crise dans l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles. Elle est appliqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 tenir compte de la situation personnelle d\u2019un agent et \u00e0 limiter le moins possible les activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles, puisqu\u2019elle peut \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la situation m\u00e9dicale particuli\u00e8re d\u2019un agent.\n[117] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re question et conclut que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans dans un but rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause et que la politique est raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire.\nQuestion 2 : L\u2019employeur a-t-il adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser ce but l\u00e9gitime?\n[118] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019employeur a adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser son but l\u00e9gitime.\n[119] Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir si la GRC a adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans pour un motif cach\u00e9 et discriminatoire. Il est ici question de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment subjectif du crit\u00e8re.\n[120] Comme la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada l\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Meiorin, aux paragraphes 60 et 61, m\u00eame si l\u2019objet g\u00e9n\u00e9ral est rationnellement li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du travail en cause, comme nous l\u2019avons vu dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, nous devons v\u00e9rifier si la politique visait de quelque fa\u00e7on que ce soit \u00e0 cibler les personnes \u00e9pileptiques, ou le gendarme Desson lui-m\u00eame, ou d\u2019autres personnes ayant des caract\u00e9ristiques semblables.\n[121] La politique de cinq ans initiale a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en 1995, bien avant l\u2019arriv\u00e9e du gendarme Desson \u00e0 la GRC, et la version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de la politique \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019avantage du gendarme Desson, puisqu\u2019elle lui a permis de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles. Par cons\u00e9quent, la politique ne peut pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e dans le but de cibler le gendarme Desson.\n[122] La politique de cinq ans ressemble aux politiques adopt\u00e9es dans bien d\u2019autres industries critiques sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. En effet, la preuve d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il existe un large consensus, dans l\u2019ensemble des industries similaires, sur le fait que le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises est suffisamment grave pour qu\u2019il faille le g\u00e9rer. Rien n\u2019indique que ces politiques sont motiv\u00e9es par autre chose que des facteurs li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019emploi.\n[123] La question est de savoir si la GRC a adopt\u00e9 la norme de bonne foi. Encore une fois, il ne fait aucun doute que la GRC a satisfait \u00e0 cette exigence. Personne n\u2019a laiss\u00e9 entendre que la GRC avait adopt\u00e9 la norme pour des raisons autres que le maintien de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans les forces polici\u00e8res.\n[124] Le plaignant soutient que la Dre Ross n\u2019approuvait pas la politique de cinq ans, car elle \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il pourrait reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles en janvier 2011, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la conduite dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel. Selon lui, elle a fait preuve de mauvaise foi lorsqu\u2019elle lui a dit qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas exercer de fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans.\n[125] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019erreur de la Dre Ross \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 son manque de connaissance de la politique de cinq ans en 2010. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une preuve de mauvaise foi de la part de la GRC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du gendarme Desson. Le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni pour d\u00e9montrer que la politique initiale ou sa version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e ont \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9es de mauvaise foi, dans le but d\u2019exclure les personnes \u00e9pileptiques, ou le gendarme Desson, directement ou arbitrairement, de leurs fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles.\n[126] Au contraire, la preuve d\u00e9montre que la GRC a fait preuve de bonne foi et que la politique \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime li\u00e9 \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. En effet, la politique de cinq ans a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9e en raison du risque r\u00e9el que posent, pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du membre, de ses coll\u00e8gues et du public, l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine et la confusion postcritique li\u00e9es \u00e0 une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie.\n[127] Le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019employeur a adopt\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans en croyant sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9aliser le but l\u00e9gitime qui consiste \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du membre, de ses coll\u00e8gues et du public. Le Tribunal r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative \u00e0 la question 2.\nQuestion 3 : L\u2019employeur a-t-il pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du plaignant au titre de la politique de cinq ans sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 subir une contrainte excessive?\n[128] Le Tribunal conclut que la GRC a pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du gendarme Desson sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 subir une contrainte excessive.\n[129] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t, c\u2019est la version r\u00e9vis\u00e9e de la politique de cinq ans qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e dans le cas du gendarme Desson. Celle-ci lui a permis de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles apr\u00e8s cinq ans sans crise, m\u00eame s\u2019il doit prendre des m\u00e9dicaments pour une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9finie.\n[130] Entre le 14 juillet 2010 et le 6 mai 2015, le gendarme Desson s\u2019est vu attribuer les cotes O6 (lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie) et O4 (lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives) :\nDu 14 juillet 2010 \u00e0 novembre 2010 : cote O6, cong\u00e9 de maladie;\nDe novembre 2010 \u00e0 janvier 2011 : cote O4, t\u00e2ches administratives;\nDe janvier 2011 \u00e0 f\u00e9vrier 2013 : cote O6, cong\u00e9 de maladie;\nDe f\u00e9vrier 2013 \u00e0 mai 2015 : cote O4, t\u00e2ches administratives;\nDepuis le 6 mai 2015 : cote O2, fonctions normales, y compris les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles.\n[131] Le plaignant est d\u2019avis que, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives de novembre 2010 \u00e0 janvier 2011, l\u2019employeur ne lui a pas confi\u00e9 de t\u00e2ches qui auraient pu contribuer \u00e0 son perfectionnement professionnel. Il croit que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas fait suffisamment d\u2019efforts pour le soutenir et prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Il soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a appliqu\u00e9 la politique de cinq ans de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sans tenir compte de sa situation personnelle, de la recommandation de la Dre Fasihy et du Dr Diggle, et du fait que ses crises avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9es par sa consommation d\u2019\u00e9ph\u00e9dra, son r\u00e9gime, son manque de sommeil ou son exercice excessif.\n[132] Le plaignant fait \u00e9galement valoir que, entre janvier 2011 et f\u00e9vrier 2013, il \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie en raison d\u2019un trouble psychiatrique, qu\u2019il attribue \u00e0 sa prise de connaissance de la politique de cinq ans. Il est d\u2019avis que la GRC aurait d\u00fb le r\u00e9int\u00e9grer dans ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles au cours de cette p\u00e9riode, ce qui lui aurait permis de r\u00e9duire la dur\u00e9e de son cong\u00e9 de maladie li\u00e9 \u00e0 un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 mentale.\nDe juillet 2010 \u00e0 janvier 2011\na) Faits\n[133] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le 14 juillet 2010, alors qu\u2019il conduisait son v\u00e9hicule personnel pour se rendre au travail, M. Desson a fait une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Il ne portait pas son uniforme, mais il portait son arme \u00e0 feu r\u00e9glementaire, des munitions et des menottes. Il a heurt\u00e9 une barri\u00e8re de ciment, et sa voiture s\u2019est arr\u00eat\u00e9e sans heurter quoi que ce soit d\u2019autre ni blesser qui que ce soit. Un homme a \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin de l\u2019accident et s\u2019est approch\u00e9 de la voiture pour pr\u00eater assistance au conducteur. Il a remarqu\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson tremblait de fa\u00e7on incontr\u00f4lable. Une ambulance a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e et le gendarme Desson a \u00e9t\u00e9 conduit \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\n[134] Dans leur rapport, les ambulanciers ont indiqu\u00e9 que la GRC \u00e9tait sur les lieux et avait pris l\u2019arme et les menottes du plaignant. Ils ont ajout\u00e9 que le plaignant conduisait sur l\u2019autoroute et qu\u2019il avait eu un accident mineur caus\u00e9 par une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. [traduction] \u00ab Le patient a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avant d\u2019embarquer sur l\u2019autoroute, il avait eu une crise d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et que sa main gauche \u00e9tait devenue engourdie. Le patient a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait d\u00fb se ranger sur l\u2019accotement. \u00bb Le rapport fait \u00e9tat d\u2019une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et d\u2019un \u00e9tat postcritique [\u00e9tat de conscience alt\u00e9r\u00e9 apr\u00e8s une crise].\n[135] Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait rendu compte, alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019ambulance, qu\u2019il allait \u00eatre en retard au travail et qu\u2019il en avait donc inform\u00e9 son coll\u00e8gue, Justin Guiel, par message texte. Pendant qu\u2019il attendait \u00e0 l\u2019urgence, le caporal Fluegal (agent des op\u00e9rations) et le caporal Stephane Hamel (gestionnaire de district) sont arriv\u00e9s. Le gendarme Desson a confi\u00e9 au caporal Hamel qu\u2019il avait eu des convulsions par le pass\u00e9 (quelques mois auparavant lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e0 la maison ainsi que cinq ans plus t\u00f4t et, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il avait perdu son permis de conduire pendant trois mois).\n[136] \u00c0 l\u2019urgence, on a not\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson ne se souvenait pas de la crise et des instants qui l\u2019ont suivie, et qu\u2019il avait souffert de confusion postcritique. La crise a dur\u00e9 une vingtaine de minutes. Le m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l\u2019urgence a demand\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson soit vu rapidement par un neurologue. Il a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Merci d\u2019examiner cet agent de police de 39 ans qui a fait deux crises en deux mois, dont une au volant. \u00bb Le m\u00e9decin a ajout\u00e9 que le tomodensitogramme de la t\u00eate \u00e9tait normal. En fait, cet examen n\u2019a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 aucune anomalie intracr\u00e2nienne grave. Le gendarme Desson a obtenu son cong\u00e9 de l\u2019h\u00f4pital.\n[137] Ce soir-l\u00e0, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que le sergent Rob Lemon avait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe de nuit ce qui lui \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019il avait eu une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et un accident. Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait furieux que ses coll\u00e8gues soient au courant de l\u2019incident. Il \u00e9prouvait de la honte d\u2019avoir eu une crise ayant caus\u00e9 un accident, et il avait peur que ses coll\u00e8gues le jugent. Il voulait que personne ne le sache.\n[138] Le 16 juillet 2010, le gendarme Desson a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 par la Dre Ross, lors d\u2019un appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas conduire dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel pendant douze mois et qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas conduire dans un contexte administratif pendant trois mois. Elle a inform\u00e9 ses gestionnaires (Jane Baptista et Walt Sutherland) que son profil m\u00e9dical avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 jour et que la cote O4 lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9e. Ses fonctions devaient donc se limiter au soutien \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de la loi ou \u00e0 l\u2019administration; il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre soumis au rappel pour mobilisation avant le 12 juillet 2011 et il ne pouvait pas conduire dans un contexte administratif avant que son cas soit r\u00e9examin\u00e9 le 13 octobre 2010.\n[139] Un EEG a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 le 27 juillet 2010. Les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient normaux, mais l\u2019EEG montrait [traduction] \u00ab des pointes provenant du lobe temporal gauche qui semblent indiquer une pr\u00e9disposition aux crises du lobe temporal gauche \u00bb.\n[140] Le 27 juillet 2010, la m\u00e9decin de famille du plaignant, la Dre Fasihy, l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inapte au travail jusqu\u2019au 30 juillet 2011.\n[141] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 le rapport concernant l\u2019EEG, le Dr Diggle, neurologue, a examin\u00e9 M. Desson le 27 juillet 2010. \u00c0 l\u2019audience et dans son affidavit, il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que c\u2019est le gendarme Desson qui lui avait donn\u00e9 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas eu acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses dossiers m\u00e9dicaux. Le neurologue a not\u00e9 dans son rapport du 27 juillet 2010 que le gendarme Desson avait eu quelques crises au cours de sa vie. La premi\u00e8re est survenue en 2005 en Ontario. Le m\u00e9decin a qualifi\u00e9 la crise de [traduction] \u00ab crise de grand mal \u00bb. Son \u00e9pouse de l\u2019\u00e9poque a d\u00e9crit [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019apparition subite de raideur des quatre extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s la nuit, quand le patient dort, suivie de tremblements, de myalgie diffuse, d\u2019h\u00e9morragies p\u00e9t\u00e9chiales et de morsures de la langue \u00bb. Il a peut-\u00eatre eu une autre crise en 2007, mais n\u2019a pas consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin. Il a eu une autre crise le 8 mai 2010, mais encore une fois n\u2019a pas consult\u00e9 un m\u00e9decin. Ce jour-l\u00e0, [traduction] \u00ab [i]l a soudainement commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 ressentir de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, est all\u00e9 regarder par la fen\u00eatre, puis s\u2019est mis \u00e0 \u201cfixer\u201d et a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir une \u201cvision tubulaire\u201d. Son bras gauche s\u2019est mis \u00e0 trembler, il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir une \u201cvision tubulaire\u201d, et lorsqu\u2019il est revenu \u00e0 lui, au moins une heure s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9coul\u00e9e. Il avait une coupure au-dessus de l\u2019\u0153il droit. Il a eu besoin de points de suture, mais aucun m\u00e9dicament pour la prophylaxie des crises ne lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 prescrit. \u00bb\n[142] Dans son affidavit, le Dr Diggle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait \u00e9tabli un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle en se fondant sur les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019EEG du 27 juillet 2010 (anormaux et r\u00e9v\u00e9lant une activit\u00e9 \u00e9pileptiforme), le rapport des ambulanciers et le rapport rempli \u00e0 l\u2019urgence qui montraient un \u00e9tat postcritique, sur le fait que le plaignant avait eu quatre crises au cours des cinq ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes et sur la description des sympt\u00f4mes qu\u2019il avait \u00e9prouv\u00e9s ou que d\u2019autres avaient observ\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de ses crises. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait manifestement souffert de confusion postcritique. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas rare que les personnes \u00e9pileptiques soient confuses et d\u00e9sorient\u00e9es apr\u00e8s une crise. Ainsi, le patient peut \u00eatre conscient et en contr\u00f4le de ses fonctions corporelles, mais ne pas \u00eatre bien orient\u00e9 dans son environnement. Apr\u00e8s une crise, la personne peut souffrir de d\u00e9faillances cognitives temporaires pendant un certain temps (pendant des heures, voire des jours), par exemple des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019attention ou de concentration, des probl\u00e8mes de m\u00e9moire \u00e0 court terme et une amn\u00e9sie r\u00e9trograde li\u00e9e \u00e0 une certaine p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la crise (quelques heures, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 une journ\u00e9e ou plus dans des cas rares).\n[143] Le Dr Diggle a d\u00e9crit la crise qui s\u2019est produite le 14 juillet 2010 lorsque le gendarme Desson conduisait :\n[traduction] Encore une fois, il a ressenti une soudaine pouss\u00e9e d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 avoir une vision tubulaire importante et des pens\u00e9es \u00e9tranges et fuyantes, comme la pression de ses pens\u00e9es. Son bras gauche est devenu engourdi, puis il a perdu conscience. Lorsqu\u2019il est revenu \u00e0 lui, des ambulanciers et des agents de la GRC l\u2019entouraient. Il s\u2019est mordu le fond de la langue, \u00e0 droite. Il n\u2019a pas perdu le contr\u00f4le de sa vessie. Il faisait de la myalgie diffuse et \u00e9tait confus et d\u00e9sorient\u00e9.\n[144] Apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 son examen m\u00e9dical, le Dr Diggle a d\u00e9crit son impression ainsi :\n[traduction] \u00c9pilepsie partielle, avec pens\u00e9e forc\u00e9e et anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 comme sympt\u00f4mes d\u2019aura. Je soup\u00e7onne des \u00e9pisodes d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 ou des crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle, suivis de crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e de type tonico-clonique. Je pr\u00e9sume qu\u2019elles proviennent de la r\u00e9gion temporale gauche, compte tenu des pointes dans l\u2019EEG. Le principal diagnostic diff\u00e9rentiel serait une \u00e9pilepsie partielle de l\u2019h\u00e9misph\u00e8re droit, vu l\u2019engourdissement du bras gauche; des foyers bitemporaux sont aussi possibles, bien que cela soit rare.\n[145] Le Dr Diggle a formul\u00e9 les recommandations suivantes :\n[traduction] 1 Examen par IRM de son cerveau, ? scl\u00e9rose temporale m\u00e9siale\n2 Interdiction de conduire pendant un an. S\u2019il n\u2019a pas d\u2019autre crise et qu\u2019il prend ses m\u00e9dicaments, le patient pourrait peut-\u00eatre recommencer \u00e0 conduire en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au bout de six mois, mais cette d\u00e9cision sera prise en temps et lieu.\n3 Interdiction de porter une arme \u00e0 feu ou d\u2019occuper un poste de responsabilit\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique pendant six mois. Cela pourrait le placer en cong\u00e9 d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 de courte dur\u00e9e, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il soit possible de lui trouver d\u2019autres fonctions (c.-\u00e0-d. des t\u00e2ches administratives). S\u2019il n\u2019est pas possible de lui trouver d\u2019autres fonctions, je le consid\u00e9rerais comme invalide pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. S\u2019il est possible de lui trouver d\u2019autres fonctions, il pourrait retourner au travail avec des t\u00e2ches modifi\u00e9es.\n4 Prophylaxie des crises. Il a maintenant eu quatre crises. Le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises est d\u2019environ 98 %. Je lui ai prescrit du T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol [\u2026]\n5 Disposition. Je le verrai en rendez-vous de suivi dans trois mois [\u2026]\n[146] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le Dr Diggle a ajout\u00e9 que, bien que les crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie du gendarme Desson aient pu \u00eatre caus\u00e9es par des d\u00e9clencheurs, le gendarme Desson demeurait pr\u00e9dispos\u00e9 aux crises en raison de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie temporale que le Dr Diggle a constat\u00e9e lors de l\u2019EEG. Il a mentionn\u00e9 au gendarme Desson qu\u2019il \u00e9tait important d\u2019\u00e9liminer les d\u00e9clencheurs connus en modifiant son mode de vie, mais que cela ne l\u2019emp\u00eacherait pas compl\u00e8tement d\u2019avoir d\u2019autres crises. Par cons\u00e9quent, il devrait prendre des m\u00e9dicaments anticonvulsivants ind\u00e9finiment.\n[147] Le 28 juillet 2010, la Dre Ross a entr\u00e9 une note dans le Syst\u00e8me d\u2019information de gestion du soutien de sant\u00e9 (SIGSS) :\n[traduction] Appel t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le membre\nIl a subi un EEG hier. L\u2019EEG montre une certaine activit\u00e9 \u00e9pileptique dans le lobe temporal gauche. Le neurologue lui a interdit de conduire (m\u00eame son v\u00e9hicule personnel) pendant six mois. Son m\u00e9decin de famille l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 totalement inapte au travail pour un an.\nIl croit que le pronostic de son m\u00e9decin de famille est fond\u00e9 sur le stress [\u2026] il est en instance de divorce, il d\u00e9teste vivre en Colombie-Britannique et maintenant l\u2019id\u00e9e de prendre l\u2019autobus est tout \u00e0 fait insultante et entra\u00eenera probablement une d\u00e9pression majeure. Il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu un \u00e9pisode de d\u00e9pression mineure.\nIl est m\u00e9content que ses coll\u00e8gues aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 (all\u00e9gation non corrobor\u00e9e) et il a une relation difficile avec certains de ses gestionnaires.\nIl a d\u00e9j\u00e0 consult\u00e9 M. Schimpf.\nP : J\u2019ai sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au membre de communiquer avec M. Bowman, qui pourrait l\u2019aider \u00e0 formuler un plan et \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des strat\u00e9gies d\u2019adaptation. Je lui ai expliqu\u00e9 la diff\u00e9rence entre le retrait d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales et le retrait d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu pour des raisons administratives.\n[148] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9 de ne pas pouvoir reprendre ses fonctions habituelles et de ne pas pouvoir conduire un v\u00e9hicule pendant une longue p\u00e9riode. Il ressentait beaucoup de stress. Il ne pouvait pas s\u2019imaginer faire des t\u00e2ches administratives, et il \u00e9tait g\u00ean\u00e9 de devoir prendre l\u2019autobus pour se d\u00e9placer.\n[149] Le 17 ao\u00fbt 2010, la Dre Fasihy a \u00e9crit dans le questionnaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 (formulaire de l\u2019intim\u00e9e) qu\u2019il y avait un risque de collision si le gendarme Desson avait une autre crise au volant. Dans la section relative aux conclusions objectives, elle a not\u00e9 la crise et la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 se concentrer. Dans la section sur les restrictions et les limitations, elle a mentionn\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e patient d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il est incapable de se concentrer et qu\u2019il est incapable de remplir ses fonctions habituelles \u00bb. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il sera en mesure de reprendre ses fonctions habituelles dans six mois s\u2019il ne fait pas de nouvelle crise.\n[150] Le 17 septembre 2010, M. Roland Bowman, psychologue r\u00e9gional \u00e0 la GRC, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la sergente d\u2019\u00e9tat-major Regina Lyon pour l\u2019informer que M. Myron Schimpf, le psychologue traitant, \u00e9tait favorable au retour au travail du plaignant avec limitation aux t\u00e2ches administratives. Il a \u00e9crit que le plaignant se sentirait plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise de retourner dans sa propre section et lui a demand\u00e9 comment il pourrait lui \u00eatre utile.\n[151] Le 27 septembre 2010, le gendarme Desson a \u00e9crit \u00e0 son superviseur direct, le caporal Babak Dabiri, pour lui dire que, lors de son dernier rendez-vous m\u00e9dical, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il retournerait au travail le 1er novembre 2010.\n[152] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il se sentait tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise de divulguer ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler \u00e0 Burnaby, il y avait sur le mur la photo des membres qui \u00e9taient absents pour diverses raisons. Il a dit qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du [traduction] \u00ab mur de la honte \u00bb et qu\u2019il ne voulait pas que sa photo y soit affich\u00e9e. Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de sa propre perception. Aucune preuve ne montre que les gendarmes ayant des restrictions m\u00e9dicales \u00e9taient stigmatis\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[153] Le 29 septembre 2010, le sergent d\u2019\u00e9tat-major Labossi\u00e8re a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans un courriel que le gendarme Desson devait revenir au travail le 1er novembre 2010 et qu\u2019il serait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. Il assisterait le caporal Clark dans le cadre de l\u2019examen des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction.\n[154] En octobre 2010, la Dre Fasihy a \u00e9crit ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 incapable de travailler au cours des derniers mois en raison d\u2019une anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 croissante, de crises r\u00e9currentes caus\u00e9es par l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, d\u2019insomnie, de maux de t\u00eate et de douleurs au cou. La r\u00e9currence des crises a augment\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment et il ne pouvait pas se rendre au travail en voiture. \u00bb La Dre Fasihy a fait remarquer que le gendarme Desson [traduction] \u00ab signale une augmentation de son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de son stress depuis 2009, lorsque son ex-\u00e9pouse, Heidi, l\u2019a appel\u00e9 pour lui demander de l\u2019argent et l\u2019a menac\u00e9 d\u2019informer son employeur qu\u2019il avait eu des crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie par le pass\u00e9, ce qui entra\u00eenerait son licenciement \u00bb.\n[155] Le 22 octobre 2010, le Dr Diggle a \u00e9crit que le gendarme Desson avait eu quatre crises de type tonico-clonique (grand mal) non provoqu\u00e9es. Il a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait probablement des d\u00e9clencheurs, soit le manque de sommeil, possiblement le je\u00fbne, l\u2019exercice excessif et la consommation d\u2019\u00e9ph\u00e9drine. Cependant, son EEG pr\u00e9sentait des pointes provenant du lobe temporal gauche. Le Dr Diggle a recommand\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson continue de prendre du T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol ind\u00e9finiment et qu\u2019il apporte des changements \u00e0 son mode de vie pour \u00e9liminer les d\u00e9clencheurs connus. Le Dr Diggle a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] J\u2019ai essay\u00e9 d\u2019expliquer la diff\u00e9rence entre une pr\u00e9disposition aux crises et les d\u00e9clencheurs des crises. Je pense qu\u2019il a tout \u00e0 fait raison d\u2019identifier les d\u00e9clencheurs et qu\u2019il a re\u00e7u un certain nombre de conseils diff\u00e9rents d\u2019une nutritionniste, d\u2019autres fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 et au moyen de ses propres recherches. Encore une fois, je pense que les renseignements qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de au sujet des d\u00e9clencheurs sont tout \u00e0 fait exacts; cependant, il a une pr\u00e9disposition sous-jacente\/latente aux crises et il devrait continuer \u00e0 prendre l\u2019anticonvulsivant m\u00eame s\u2019il contr\u00f4le ad\u00e9quatement ses crises. [\u2026] Il n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019autre crise et il continue de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments, soit une dose stable de T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol. Il peut recommencer \u00e0 conduire le 14 janvier 2011. Il se sera alors \u00e9coul\u00e9 six mois depuis sa derni\u00e8re crise.\n[156] Le Dr Diggle a \u00e9crit que le gendarme Desson pouvait recommencer \u00e0 conduire le 14 janvier 2011.\n[157] Le 6 novembre 2010, le gendarme Desson a entrepris un retour progressif au travail au service de Burnaby. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. Certains de ses coll\u00e8gues lui ont demand\u00e9 comment il allait dans la t\u00eate ou comment il se sentait, s\u2019il allait bien et m\u00eame s\u2019il avait fait d\u2019autres crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il est devenu \u00e9vident pour lui que ses renseignements m\u00e9dicaux avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s et que leur confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le travail qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9 \u00e0 son retour au travail (pr\u00e9parer des trousses d\u2019orientation pour les nouveaux membres) \u00e9tait un travail abrutissant qui l\u2019humiliait et qui n\u2019avait aucune utilit\u00e9 pour son avancement professionnel.\n[158] Le 18 novembre 2010, le caporal Ferron a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes personnes au sujet des modalit\u00e9s de retour au travail du gendarme Desson. Comme il lui \u00e9tait interdit de conduire, il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019il fasse du covoiturage avec un coll\u00e8gue, le gendarme Guile. Son travail devait se faire au service de Burnaby, sous la supervision du caporal Clark. Il allait s\u2019occuper de l\u2019examen des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction et, \u00e0 temps perdu, il pr\u00e9parerait des trousses d\u2019orientation pour les nouveaux membres. Il a en fait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 effectuer les t\u00e2ches li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019examen des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction le 16 novembre 2010.\n[159] Le 25 novembre 2010, la Dre Fasihy a rempli un certificat m\u00e9dical indiquant que le gendarme Desson n\u2019avait pas eu de crise depuis le 14 juillet 2010. Elle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab en mesure de reprendre pleinement ses fonctions polici\u00e8res le 14 janvier 2011 \u2013 pathologie r\u00e9solue \u00bb.\n[160] Le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2010, la Dre Ross a inform\u00e9 le gendarme Desson qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u la recommandation de la Dre Fasihy et elle a \u00e9crit dans le SIGSS : [traduction] \u00ab Nous allons vous autoriser \u00e0 reprendre toutes vos fonctions, sauf la conduite dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel. \u00bb Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Lorsqu\u2019il y a un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, les lignes directrices pr\u00e9voient qu\u2019il faut qu\u2019il se soit \u00e9coul\u00e9 cinq ans depuis la derni\u00e8re crise, \u00e0 certaines exceptions pr\u00e8s (les recommandations peuvent varier d\u2019un cas \u00e0 l\u2019autre, pour des motifs exceptionnels). \u00bb\n[161] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2010, la Dre Ross a inform\u00e9 le gendarme Desson que, pour qu\u2019il puisse profiter de l\u2019exception, elle avait besoin d\u2019une lettre du Dr Diggle pr\u00e9cisant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel et expliquant pourquoi il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019attendre l\u2019expiration de la pleine p\u00e9riode recommand\u00e9e de cinq ans.\n[162] \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, le gendarme Desson a inform\u00e9 la sergente Baptista qu\u2019il reprendrait rapidement toutes ses fonctions. La sergente Baptista a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire un v\u00e9hicule de police.\n[163] Le 23 d\u00e9cembre 2010, la Dre Ross a inform\u00e9 le gendarme Desson qu\u2019elle avait eu une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence avec quelqu\u2019un \u00e0 Ottawa (le Dr Beaulieu) au sujet de la politique et qu\u2019elle aimerait le rencontrer pour en discuter. La rencontre a eu lieu le 6 janvier 2011.\n[164] Le 4 janvier 2011, la Dre Fasihy a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le gendarme Desson inapte au travail jusqu\u2019au 14 janvier 2011, puis elle l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inapte au travail du 14 janvier au 29 f\u00e9vrier 2011 en raison [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019\u00e9tourdissements, de probl\u00e8mes de concentration, de stress et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb. Le cong\u00e9 de maladie a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9 jusqu\u2019en 2013.\n[165] Le 6 janvier 2011, le Dr Diggle a eu une conversation t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique avec le gendarme Desson. Dans son rapport du 6 janvier 2011, il a indiqu\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson lui avait dit que chaque crise avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e de la consommation de stimulants (\u00e9ph\u00e9dra et produits \u00e0 base d\u2019\u00e9ph\u00e9dra). Il a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] Bien que les r\u00e9sultats de son EEG laissent entendre qu\u2019il a un seuil \u00e9pileptog\u00e8ne plus bas que la plupart des gens, toutes ses crises sont associ\u00e9es \u00e0 des d\u00e9clencheurs identifiables et imm\u00e9diats. Bien que je croie que les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019EEG \u00e9voquent une pr\u00e9disposition, l\u2019examen par IRM n\u2019a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 aucune anomalie structurelle et les r\u00e9sultats de son examen neurologique sont normaux.\n[166] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le Dr Diggle a expliqu\u00e9 dans son affidavit que : [traduction] \u00ab [l]\u2019\u00e9pilepsie partielle est caus\u00e9e par une anomalie structurelle ou inflammatoire chez le patient, bien qu\u2019il ne soit pas rare \u2013 comme dans le cas de M. Desson \u2013 qu\u2019une telle anomalie soit trop petite pour \u00eatre d\u00e9tect\u00e9e par imagerie m\u00e9dicale, comme par tomodensitom\u00e9trie et par IRM \u00bb. Il a ajout\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab M. Desson pr\u00e9sente un risque \u00e9lev\u00e9 de r\u00e9currence des crises, qui persistera toute sa vie \u00bb (non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original).\n[167] Le m\u00e9decin a recommand\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson continue de prendre un m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant (T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol) ind\u00e9finiment et qu\u2019il \u00e9vite les d\u00e9clencheurs pour \u00eatre en mesure de reprendre toutes ses t\u00e2ches op\u00e9rationnelles et de retrouver un permis de classe 5 complet.\n[168] Il a ajout\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Je pense qu\u2019il est important de faire la distinction entre les d\u00e9clencheurs imm\u00e9diats des crises de cet homme. De toute \u00e9vidence, les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019EEG \u00e9voquent une pr\u00e9disposition, mais contrairement \u00e0 bon nombre de patients, ses crises n\u2019\u00e9taient pas non provoqu\u00e9es. Elles \u00e9taient toutes associ\u00e9es \u00e0 un d\u00e9clencheur imm\u00e9diat, ce qui diff\u00e9rencie les crises provoqu\u00e9es et non provoqu\u00e9es. Comme les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019EEG \u00e9voquent une pr\u00e9disposition, je recommande le T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol.\n[169] Le Dr Diggle a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 discuter du cas [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence de d\u00e9clencheurs imm\u00e9diats, qui est inhabituelle et qui constitue un facteur pertinent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb.\n[170] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, au moyen de son affidavit, le Dr Diggle a ajout\u00e9 que ce ne sont pas toutes les personnes qui ont une ou plusieurs crises qui souffrent d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Par exemple, les personnes qui ont des convulsions en raison d\u2019un sevrage alcoolique, d\u2019une intoxication par les drogues ou d\u2019une infection comme la m\u00e9ningite, qui ne laissent aucune anomalie durable au cerveau, ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e9pileptiques. Il a ajout\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait eu quatre crises non provoqu\u00e9es et que la pr\u00e9sence de certains d\u00e9clencheurs ou facteurs pr\u00e9cipitants [traduction] \u00ab ne change[ait] rien \u00e0 la conclusion que les crises de M. Desson \u00e9taient non provoqu\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[171] Le m\u00eame jour, soit le 6 janvier 2011, \u00e0 15 h 12, la Dre Ross a discut\u00e9 au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone avec le Dr Diggle. Ses notes indiquent que le Dr Diggle approuvait la politique de cinq ans r\u00e9vis\u00e9e, alors sous forme d\u2019\u00e9bauche.\n[172] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le Dr Diggle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas des d\u00e9tails de cette conversation, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait peu probable qu\u2019il ait pris position sur des lignes directrices internes concernant le retour au travail, car il ne lui appartenait pas de commenter les politiques des employeurs. Son r\u00f4le est d\u2019ordre m\u00e9dical : il doit s\u2019assurer que ses patients re\u00e7oivent les meilleurs soins possibles pour \u00e9viter que d\u2019autres crises ne surviennent.\n[173] Plus tard le 6 janvier 2011, la Dre Ross a envoy\u00e9 une copie de la note au gendarme Desson et lui a parl\u00e9 au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Elle a expliqu\u00e9 que, contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle lui avait dit le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2010, la politique de cinq ans ne lui permettait pas de reprendre ses fonctions normales le 14 janvier 2011, comme il en avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9, et qu\u2019il devrait effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives pendant cinq ans, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la politique.\n[174] Le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement d\u00e9\u00e7u. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre m\u00e9fiant et \u00e0 faire un peu moins confiance \u00e0 la Dre Ross.\n[175] Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il avait \u00e9galement eu une conversation avec le Dr Diggle le 6 janvier 2011 et que le m\u00e9decin lui avait dit qu\u2019il ne voyait pas pourquoi il ne pouvait pas reprendre ses fonctions normales \u00e0 compter du 14 janvier 2011, comme il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9.\n[176] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le Dr Diggle a dit que lorsqu\u2019il avait accept\u00e9 d\u2019autoriser le gendarme Desson \u00e0 reprendre l\u2019exercice de ses fonctions en janvier 2011, il ne d\u00e9cidait pas quelles fonctions il pouvait exercer (t\u00e2ches administratives, fonctions polici\u00e8res normales, code 3). Cette d\u00e9cision ne lui appartenait pas.\n[177] Le Dr Diggle a expliqu\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait 15 % de chances de ne plus avoir de crises s\u2019il prenait ses m\u00e9dicaments :\n[traduction] [C]ompte tenu du fait que M. Desson a eu quatre crises d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie et que les r\u00e9sultats de son EEG sont anormaux, son risque de r\u00e9currence des crises est de 98 % s\u2019il ne prend pas de m\u00e9dicaments. Le calcul est bas\u00e9 sur des donn\u00e9es globales bien connues provenant de la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale, qui fournit des statistiques sur le taux de r\u00e9currence des crises chez les personnes ayant re\u00e7u un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. D\u2019autres neurologues au courant de ces donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales pourraient conclure que le risque est aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que 100 % ou \u00eatre aussi faible que 90 %. Les m\u00eames donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales m\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 conclure que M. Desson a 85 % de chances d\u2019\u00eatre \u00ab lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des crises \u00bb, c.-\u00e0-d. de ne plus faire de crises, s\u2019il prend un seul m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant ind\u00e9finiment.\nLes donn\u00e9es m\u00e9dicales \u00e9tablissent qu\u2019environ 15 % des patients qui souffrent d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, comme le gendarme Desson, auront une autre crise m\u00eame s\u2019ils prennent un m\u00e9dicament.\n[178] Il a ajout\u00e9 que le risque de r\u00e9currence ne peut pas \u00eatre individualis\u00e9 et est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9 pour tous les patients qui re\u00e7oivent un diagnostic d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Seul le passage du temps sans r\u00e9currence des crises permettra de savoir si un patient tombe dans les 85 % de patients qui prennent un seul m\u00e9dicament et qui ne font pas d\u2019autres crises ou dans les 15 % de patients qui subiront d\u2019autres crises :\n[traduction] 17. [\u2026] \u00c0 mesure que le temps passe sans qu\u2019il y ait d\u2019autres crises, le risque de r\u00e9currence du patient diminue. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque des faits, compte tenu de la situation de M. Desson, de son profil m\u00e9dical et de ma connaissance des statistiques fournies dans la litt\u00e9rature m\u00e9dicale, j\u2019aurais consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme tr\u00e8s faible le risque que M. Desson ait une autre crise s\u2019il prenait des m\u00e9dicaments et qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas de crises depuis trois \u00e0 cinq ans.\n18. En me fondant sur les d\u00e9clarations de M. Desson, j\u2019ai d\u2019abord conclu que certains facteurs ou \u00e9v\u00e9nements avaient peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9clench\u00e9 les crises ant\u00e9rieures de M. Desson. Cependant, j\u2019ai fini par conclure que ces d\u00e9clencheurs n\u2019avaient pas caus\u00e9 les crises de M. Desson. Ils ont peut-\u00eatre tout simplement abaiss\u00e9 davantage son seuil \u00e9pileptog\u00e8ne. Les \u00e9pileptiques comme M. Desson sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 plus vuln\u00e9rables aux crises que la population en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u2013 leur seuil \u00e9pileptog\u00e8ne est donc plus bas \u2013 et ils pr\u00e9sentent un risque beaucoup plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 soudaine en raison d\u2019une crise. Certains d\u00e9clencheurs, comme la consommation de stimulants, l\u2019exercice\/l\u2019hyperventilation et le manque de sommeil, peuvent exacerber ce risque plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de crise. Compte tenu du nombre et de la nature des crises ant\u00e9rieures du gendarme Desson, j\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019il ne parviendrait pas \u00e0 ma\u00eetriser son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 en se contentant d\u2019\u00e9viter les d\u00e9clencheurs possibles (comme la consommation de stimulants et d\u2019\u00e9ph\u00e9dra, le je\u00fbne ou l\u2019exercice excessif). Par cons\u00e9quent, je lui ai prescrit un m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant \u2013 le T\u00e9gr\u00e9tol (carbamaz\u00e9pine) \u2013 et tout au long du traitement, j\u2019ai recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il continue de prendre un m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant ind\u00e9finiment.\n[179] Le 7 janvier 2011, le gendarme Desson a rencontr\u00e9 la Dre Ross, le sergent Whitworth et l\u2019inspectrice Schwartz. La Dre Ross a de nouveau expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle lui avait donn\u00e9 un renseignement erron\u00e9 lors de leur conversation pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente au sujet du retour \u00e0 l\u2019exercice des fonctions polici\u00e8res normales et qu\u2019il devait \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives pendant une p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. Le gendarme Desson a dit que c\u2019\u00e9tait inconcevable et que sa carri\u00e8re \u00e9tait, selon lui, ruin\u00e9e. La Dre Ross a mentionn\u00e9 dans ses notes qu\u2019ils ont discut\u00e9 de ses options de carri\u00e8re.\n[180] Le 14 janvier 2011, le gendarme Desson a cess\u00e9 d\u2019exercer ses fonctions administratives et est parti en cong\u00e9 de maladie pendant deux ans pour cause de stress et d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9.\nb) Analyse\n[181] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, pour la p\u00e9riode de juillet 2010 \u00e0 janvier 2011, le Tribunal conclut que le gendarme Desson, contrairement \u00e0 sa perception, a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une \u00e9valuation individualis\u00e9e et que la politique de cinq ans n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e comme une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La preuve d\u00e9montre \u00e9galement que la GRC a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de nombreux efforts pour lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation lors de son retour au travail.\n[182] En effet, le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9 d\u2019admettre qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie malgr\u00e9 l\u2019opinion du Dr Diggle. Selon lui, il avait fait des crises, mais elles \u00e9taient enti\u00e8rement li\u00e9es \u00e0 des d\u00e9clencheurs, soit la consommation d\u2019\u00e9ph\u00e9dra, l\u2019exercice excessif et le manque de sommeil. Il a m\u00eame dit \u00e0 la Dre Ross en juillet 2010 que c\u2019\u00e9tait la raison pour laquelle la d\u00e9cision de son propre m\u00e9decin, la Dre Fasihy, de le mettre en cong\u00e9 pendant un an \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au stress (le divorce, il d\u00e9testait habiter en Colombie-Britannique et le fait de prendre l\u2019autobus \u00e9tait insultant) et entra\u00eenerait probablement un \u00e9pisode de d\u00e9pression majeure. Il n\u2019a pas admis qu\u2019il souffre d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Son opinion est demeur\u00e9e la m\u00eame, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que le Dr Diggle, un neurologue sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, a confirm\u00e9 sans l\u2019ombre d\u2019un doute que le gendarme Desson est \u00e9pileptique et qu\u2019il aura besoin de prendre des m\u00e9dicaments anticonvulsivants pour le reste de sa vie, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9vite les d\u00e9clencheurs connus. La cause de ses crises est une pr\u00e9disposition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9e par l\u2019EEG.\n[183] Dans son application de la politique de cinq ans, la GRC a tenu compte de la pr\u00e9disposition du gendarme Desson \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, confirm\u00e9e par un EEG, et du diagnostic du Dr Diggle. Elle a proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une analyse et pris des d\u00e9cisions en fonction de la situation particuli\u00e8re du gendarme Desson. La politique de cinq ans \u00e9tablit une distinction entre les diff\u00e9rents types de crises et leur origine. Lorsque l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie est \u00e0 l\u2019origine des crises, une proc\u00e9dure particuli\u00e8re est pr\u00e9vue. C\u2019est cette proc\u00e9dure qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e au gendarme Desson. Le Tribunal prend \u00e9galement note de l\u2019explication du Dr Diggle selon laquelle le risque de r\u00e9currence des crises ne peut pas \u00eatre personnalis\u00e9 et seul le temps permet de savoir si une personne aura ou non une nouvelle crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie.\n[184] Face \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait \u00e0 faire du travail administratif et qu\u2019il ne serait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 conduire pendant un certain temps, le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait senti non seulement d\u00e9\u00e7u, mais insult\u00e9 et humili\u00e9. Il a eu la m\u00eame r\u00e9action lorsqu\u2019il a appris que certains de ses coll\u00e8gues avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait fait une crise et qu\u2019il avait eu un accident. Il avait l\u2019impression qu\u2019il se retrouverait sur le [traduction] \u00ab mur de la honte \u00bb et qu\u2019il serait mal vu par ses coll\u00e8gues. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que rien n\u2019\u00e9taye le point de vue du gendarme Desson selon lequel il serait l\u2019objet de stigmates.\n[185] Malgr\u00e9 le refus du gendarme Desson d\u2019accepter son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et son attitude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des t\u00e2ches administratives, la GRC a essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins de diverses fa\u00e7ons. En effet, lorsque le gendarme Desson a inform\u00e9 la Dre Ross que le fait de ne pas exercer de fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles et de ne pas conduire pourrait l\u2019amener \u00e0 souffrir d\u2019une d\u00e9pression majeure, elle lui a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de communiquer avec M. Bowman, psychologue, pour qu\u2019il l\u2019aide \u00e0 formuler un plan et \u00e0 \u00e9laborer des strat\u00e9gies d\u2019adaptation, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait, et le gendarme Desson a re\u00e7u des soins psychologiques. Dans ses communications avec la sergente d\u2019\u00e9tat-major Lyon au sujet du retour au travail du gendarme Desson, M. Bowman a tenu compte du fait que le gendarme Desson se sentirait plus \u00e0 l\u2019aise s\u2019il retournait dans sa propre section, comme le recommandait son psychologue, M. Schimpf. Cette recommandation a \u00e9t\u00e9 suivie, le gendarme Desson ayant entrepris un retour progressif au travail au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, o\u00f9 il a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson ne pouvait pas conduire, la GRC a pris des dispositions pour qu\u2019il se rende au travail avec un coll\u00e8gue. Les horaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 planifi\u00e9s en cons\u00e9quence.\n[186] Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le travail administratif qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 confi\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby (examen des pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 conviction et pr\u00e9paration des trousses d\u2019orientation pour les nouveaux membres) \u00e9tait abrutissant, humiliant et inutile pour son avancement professionnel. Le gendarme Desson a l\u2019impression que les d\u00e9cisions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises ont ruin\u00e9 sa carri\u00e8re. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord.\n[187] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la GRC a tent\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du gendarme Desson sans subir de contrainte excessive. La GRC a fait des efforts sinc\u00e8res pour envisager toutes les solutions possibles, sans subir de contrainte excessive, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson ne pouvait pas exercer de fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles en application de la politique de cinq ans. La GRC lui a plut\u00f4t confi\u00e9 des t\u00e2ches administratives dans son propre d\u00e9tachement au cours de la p\u00e9riode de deux mois de novembre et d\u00e9cembre 2010.\n[188] Dans un autre ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, le Tribunal fait remarquer que la Dre Ross a commis une erreur importante lorsqu\u2019elle a dit au gendarme Desson que la seule restriction qui s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 lui \u00e9tait l\u2019interdiction de conduire dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel pendant cinq ans \u00e0 compter de janvier 2011. V\u00e9rification faite aupr\u00e8s du Dr Beaulieu, elle a ensuite expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9e et que la politique de cinq ans interdisait l\u2019exercice de toutes les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles pendant cinq ans.\n[189] L\u2019erreur commise par la Dre Ross a affect\u00e9 le gendarme Desson. Il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre m\u00e9fiant et \u00e0 faire un peu moins confiance \u00e0 la Dre Ross. Celle-ci a donc sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019un autre m\u00e9decin-chef se charge du dossier du gendarme Desson afin de r\u00e9tablir la confiance n\u00e9cessaire entre l\u2019employ\u00e9 et le m\u00e9decin-chef. Encore une fois, la GRC a r\u00e9agi \u00e0 la situation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du gendarme Desson.\n[190] De plus, c\u2019est la politique de cinq ans en tant que telle qui a eu une tr\u00e8s grande incidence sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 mentale du gendarme Desson. Les choses ont empir\u00e9 par la suite, car il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en cong\u00e9 de maladie pendant pr\u00e8s de deux ans apr\u00e8s avoir appris qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles en janvier 2011. La prochaine section concerne cette p\u00e9riode de deux ans.\nDu 14 janvier 2011 \u00e0 janvier 2013\na) Faits\n[191] Pendant la p\u00e9riode du 14 janvier 2011 \u00e0 janvier 2013, le gendarme Desson a consult\u00e9 la Dre Fasihy et M. Schimpf r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement, soit environ une fois par mois.\n[192] Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2011, M. Bowman, psychologue r\u00e9gional \u00e0 la GRC, a remarqu\u00e9 que, lorsque le gendarme Desson est retourn\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, il avait trouv\u00e9 tr\u00e8s p\u00e9nible le fait de se trouver dans un service op\u00e9rationnel, mais d\u2019\u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. M. Bowman a \u00e9crit un courriel \u00e0 la sergente Shepherd, conseill\u00e8re en perfectionnement et en renouvellement des ressources humaines, pour l\u2019en informer. Voici ce qu\u2019il a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] Sur le plan psychologique, Mike n\u2019est pas pour le moment apte \u00e0 travailler. Cependant, il m\u2019a dit qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis il serait possible d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer son r\u00e9tablissement si un placement professionnel convenable pouvait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9 maintenant afin qu\u2019il puisse se concentrer sur un objectif. Cela me semble logique d\u2019un point de vue clinique.\n[193] Le 18 mai 2011, M. Schimpf, psychologue traitant, a \u00e9crit dans son rapport d\u2019\u00e9tape que le gendarme Desson [traduction] \u00ab aura beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans un environnement policier qui lui rappelle constamment ce qu\u2019il n\u2019est plus capable de faire, mais en m\u00eame temps si on pouvait lui trouver des fonctions convenables, cela serait en fin de compte profitable pour lui \u00bb. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Schimpf a recommand\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson ne soit pas affect\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9tachement o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019agents de police exer\u00e7ant des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles (en uniforme) lui rappellerait probablement sa situation et aggraverait son \u00e9tat.\n[194] Le 15 ao\u00fbt 2011, M. Bowman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu une longue conversation avec le gendarme Desson et qu\u2019il lui avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de s\u2019entretenir avec la sergente d\u2019\u00e9tat-major Edna Dechant, charg\u00e9e de la dotation \u00e0 Burnaby, pour discuter d\u2019un placement hors d\u00e9tachement.\n[195] Le 6 octobre 2011, la sergente Shepherd a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bowman et \u00e0 la Dre Johnson si le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 effectuer un retour progressif au travail, indiquant que John Bruer cherchait un membre aux services d\u2019examen. La personne examinerait les d\u00e9penses de nature d\u00e9licate, comme les paiements \u00e0 des sources de renseignement.\n[196] Le 7 octobre 2011, M. Bowman a indiqu\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson ne pensait pas qu\u2019il pourrait retourner au travail de sit\u00f4t. Le gendarme Desson n\u2019arrivait tout simplement pas \u00e0 accepter la d\u00e9cision selon laquelle il \u00e9tait inapte aux t\u00e2ches op\u00e9rationnelles. M. Bowman a fait remarquer que le gendarme Desson avait cess\u00e9 de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments, notamment ses m\u00e9dicaments anticonvulsivants, de son propre chef. M. Bowman a recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il consulte un psychiatre, le Dr Babbage.\n[197] M. Bowman a ensuite inform\u00e9 la sergente Shepherd que le gendarme Desson n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 entreprendre un retour progressif au travail.\n[198] Le 1er novembre 2011, la Dre Johnson a inform\u00e9 le gendarme Desson qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 de r\u00e9viser la politique de cinq ans pour permettre \u00e0 un membre de reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles selon certains crit\u00e8res, qu\u2019il prenne ou non des m\u00e9dicaments. Le gendarme Desson a ensuite dit qu\u2019il recommencerait \u00e0 prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un m\u00e9decin.\n[199] Le 2 novembre 2011, la Dre Johnson a not\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait re\u00e7u un appel du psychiatre pour prendre rendez-vous, mais qu\u2019il avait refus\u00e9. Le gendarme Desson l\u2019a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il avait fait des recherches et qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments.\n[200] Le 3 novembre 2011, lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, le gendarme Desson a inform\u00e9 la Dre Johnson, M. Schimpf et M. Bowman qu\u2019il serait g\u00eanant et difficile pour lui de retourner travailler au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, parce que les gens savaient qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019un trouble \u00e9pileptique. Il aurait trop honte d\u2019y retourner.\n[201] M. Bowman a ensuite \u00e9crit \u00e0 la sergente Shepherd pour lui demander de tenir compte du fait que le gendarme Desson ne pouvait pas retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby et pour lui dire qu\u2019il devrait \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans un environnement non op\u00e9rationnel. Il a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je vous saurais gr\u00e9 d\u2019accorder une certaine priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce membre, qui a naturellement beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 tol\u00e9rer l\u2019incertitude entourant sa situation actuelle. \u00bb\n[202] Le 16 novembre 2011, la Dre Johnson a not\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait eu une conversation avec la sergente Shepherd pour discuter des postes qui pourraient l\u2019int\u00e9resser.\n[203] Le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2011, M. Bowman a signal\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait eu une conversation avec le fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 du gendarme Desson, qui avait indiqu\u00e9 que celui-ci \u00e9tait apte \u00e0 travailler dans les limites des restrictions qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es.\n[204] Le 12 janvier 2012, le gendarme Desson a inform\u00e9 la Dre Johnson que son fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 avait recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il demeure en arr\u00eat de travail jusqu\u2019au 30 mars 2012. Il l\u2019a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9e qu\u2019il ne voulait pas prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments, parce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e9rait l\u2019approche [traduction] \u00ab naturelle \u00bb.\n[205] Au d\u00e9but de 2012, le gendarme Desson a rencontr\u00e9 la sergente Shepherd pour discuter d\u2019un retour progressif au travail. Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, pendant cette rencontre, la sergente Shepherd l\u2019avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme [traduction] \u00ab un de [s]es \u00e9pileptiques \u00bb. Le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s contrari\u00e9 et ne voulait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 de cette fa\u00e7on. Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la sergente Shepherd lui avait m\u00eame dit que son mari \u00e9tait d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait retourn\u00e9e au travail rapidement, pour essayer de lui donner de l\u2019espoir et l\u2019encourager \u00e0 retourner au travail. Le gendarme Desson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait rabaiss\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle l\u2019avait trait\u00e9 avec condescendance. La sergente Shepherd a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il pleurait, qu\u2019il \u00e9tait frustr\u00e9 et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s \u00e9motif. Elle a affirm\u00e9 que ses intentions \u00e9taient bonnes et qu\u2019elle essayait de trouver des t\u00e2ches qui seraient gratifiantes pour lui. Elle essayait de l\u2019encourager \u00e0 retourner au travail et elle \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9ployer des efforts en ce sens. Le gendarme Desson a dit qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[206] Le 17 janvier 2012, la sergente Shepherd a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u une demande de la section int\u00e9gr\u00e9e des produits de la criminalit\u00e9 qui, selon elle, conviendrait au gendarme Desson. On lui a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 quel moment il retournerait au travail. M. Bowman a laiss\u00e9 un message au fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 du gendarme Desson pour v\u00e9rifier si cette possibilit\u00e9 pouvait lui convenir.\n[207] Le 22 f\u00e9vrier 2012, M. Bowman a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une nouvelle demande pour que le gendarme Desson soit vu par le Dr Babbage, psychiatre.\n[208] Le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2022, la sergente Shepherd a \u00e9crit au gendarme Desson pour lui dire qu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u plusieurs demandes pour pourvoir des postes de retour progressif au travail. L\u2019un de ces postes \u00e9tait dans la section des crimes graves. Elle lui a demand\u00e9 s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[209] Le lendemain, le gendarme Desson a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas encore obtenu l\u2019autorisation m\u00e9dicale d\u2019entamer un retour progressif au travail. Il a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Veuillez prendre note que je ne vous donnerai pas de pr\u00e9cisions sur mon \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 et que je ne r\u00e9pondrai \u00e0 aucune question sur mes ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents m\u00e9dicaux, car vous savez que ces renseignements sont confidentiels. \u00bb\n[210] Le 6 mars 2012, le gendarme Desson a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois par le Dr Babbage, psychiatre. L\u2019impression du m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait la suivante : 1) exclure la d\u00e9pression majeure, l\u00e9g\u00e8rement superpos\u00e9e \u00e0 la dysthymie; 2) exclure la d\u00e9pression due \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie; 3) exclure la possibilit\u00e9 que les m\u00e9dicaments aient un effet sur l\u2019humeur; 4) exclure le trouble d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9e. Le Dr Babbage a continu\u00e9 de traiter le gendarme Desson r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par la suite.\n[211] Le 14 mars 2012, M. Bowman a inform\u00e9 la sergente Shepherd que le gendarme Desson ne serait pas en mesure de retourner au travail \u00e0 quelque titre que ce soit avant trois \u00e0 six mois.\n[212] Dans son rapport du 8 mai 2012, M. Schimpf a expliqu\u00e9 ainsi les restrictions impos\u00e9es au gendarme Desson :\n[traduction] Il n\u2019y a pas de restrictions psychologiques en ce qui concerne les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales, mais il y a bien s\u00fbr une interdiction m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (voir ci-dessus). La question de l\u2019all\u00e9gement ou de la modification des t\u00e2ches est complexe, car le membre a obtenu l\u2019autorisation m\u00e9dicale d\u2019effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives, mais c\u2019est ici que les limitations psychologiques deviennent pertinentes. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le membre se d\u00e9finit depuis longtemps en termes de prouesses physiques et athl\u00e9tiques (il est un ancien culturiste de comp\u00e9tition et a toujours particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 diverses activit\u00e9s de nature sportive), et il est extr\u00eamement difficile pour lui d\u2019\u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de faire ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir policier. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 dans des rapports ant\u00e9rieurs, il aura beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans un environnement policier qui lui rappelle constamment ce qu\u2019il n\u2019est plus capable de faire, mais en m\u00eame temps si on pouvait lui trouver des fonctions convenables, cela serait en fin de compte profitable pour lui. Par cons\u00e9quent, une planification soigneuse et une communication efficace (avec la participation du membre) demeurent imp\u00e9ratives. Je r\u00e9it\u00e8re la recommandation de ne pas affecter le membre \u00e0 un d\u00e9tachement o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019agents de police exer\u00e7ant des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles (en uniforme) lui rappellerait probablement sa situation et aggraverait son \u00e9tat.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[213] Le 17 mai 2012, M. Bowman a communiqu\u00e9 avec la nouvelle agente de dotation charg\u00e9e du dossier du gendarme Desson, la sergente Dawn Parker (conseill\u00e8re en mati\u00e8re de retour au travail et de renvoi pour raisons m\u00e9dicales, Services des relations en milieu de travail, quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division E). Il l\u2019a inform\u00e9e que le fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 du gendarme Desson l\u2019avait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 accomplir des t\u00e2ches administratives dans un environnement non op\u00e9rationnel (sans agents en uniforme).\n[214] Le 29 mai 2022, une rencontre a eu lieu au bureau de M. Bowman avec le gendarme Desson et la sergente Parker. M. Bowman a not\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab il est clair que Mike a encore beaucoup de mal \u00e0 s\u2019adapter \u00e0 son statut de membre non op\u00e9rationnel \u00bb. Il ne voulait pas faire un retour progressif au travail. Il voulait occuper un poste \u00e0 temps plein, parce qu\u2019il pensait qu\u2019un retour progressif au travail l\u2019exposerait \u00e0 des stigmates. Il voulait travailler dans une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais il a accept\u00e9 de garder l\u2019esprit ouvert pour envisager un placement dans un d\u00e9tachement. Il a toutefois \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que, \u00e0 ce stade-ci, ses fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 recommandaient qu\u2019il ne soit pas plac\u00e9 dans un environnement o\u00f9 travaillent des agents en uniforme et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable qu\u2019il soit plac\u00e9 ailleurs que dans un d\u00e9tachement.\n[215] Le 6 juin 2012, la sergente Parker a \u00e9crit au gendarme Desson pour l\u2019informer que si un poste adapt\u00e9 \u00e0 ses limitations et \u00e0 ses restrictions lui \u00e9tait propos\u00e9 et qu\u2019il le refusait, il serait tenu [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019expliquer pourquoi le poste n\u2019[\u00e9tait] pas convenable \u00bb, car le processus ne pouvait pas se poursuivre ind\u00e9finiment. Elle l\u2019a invit\u00e9 \u00e0 envisager s\u00e9rieusement les options qui lui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es.\n[216] Le 13 juin 2012, le surintendant Aubry (officier responsable des services \u00e0 la client\u00e8le au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby) a \u00e9crit \u00e0 Dave Nassichuck pour lui dire que le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait un jeune agent qui aspirait \u00e0 travailler comme agent de police de premi\u00e8re ligne, dans un poste qui tiendrait compte de sa d\u00e9ficience, et qu\u2019il avait exprim\u00e9 son int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la prise des mesures d\u2019adaptation dans un r\u00f4le op\u00e9rationnel. [traduction] \u00ab Je crois qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre un bon candidat pour les Affaires sp\u00e9ciales O, o\u00f9 il pourrait effectuer de la surveillance. \u00bb\n[217] Le 3 juillet 2012, la sergente Parker a pos\u00e9 des questions \u00e0 la Dre Johnson, la m\u00e9decin-chef responsable du dossier du gendarme Desson \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, au sujet des restrictions et limitations du gendarme Desson. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, dans le profil m\u00e9dical, la seule restriction mentionn\u00e9e \u00e9tait la restriction aux t\u00e2ches administratives, alors que M. Bowman avait mentionn\u00e9 que le fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 du gendarme Desson avait dit qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre trop difficile pour lui sur le plan psychologique d\u2019\u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans un environnement o\u00f9 travaillent des agents en uniforme et avait recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit plac\u00e9 ailleurs que dans un d\u00e9tachement. La sergente Parker a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Dre Johnson si elle \u00e9tait d\u2019accord.\n[218] Le 13 juillet 2012, la Dre Johnson a rencontr\u00e9 M. Bowman, la sergente Parker et d\u2019autres personnes pour discuter des param\u00e8tres du retour au travail du gendarme Desson.\n[219] D\u2019autres discussions ont eu lieu avec M. Schimpf, M. Bowman et la sergente Parker afin de trouver un poste convenable pour le gendarme Desson et d\u2019essayer de satisfaire \u00e0 son d\u00e9sir de ne pas faire un retour progressif au travail et de ne pas \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans un environnement o\u00f9 travaillent des agents en uniforme.\n[220] Le 4 septembre 2012, une rencontre a eu lieu dans le bureau de M. Schimpf (le psychologue traitant du gendarme Desson) avec la sergente Parker, M. Bowman et le gendarme Desson. Le gendarme Desson a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019il envisagerait d\u2019occuper un poste au sein d\u2019une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, des Affaires sp\u00e9ciales O, d\u2019une \u00e9quipe du Groupe tactique d\u2019intervention (GTI) ou des services de police communautaires \u00e0 Surrey. La sergente Parker s\u2019est engag\u00e9e \u00e0 faire un suivi avec le gendarme Desson apr\u00e8s avoir fait plus de recherches sur les emplois disponibles.\n[221] Dans une conversation \u00e9crite avec la Dre Johnson, la sergente Parker a demand\u00e9 le profil m\u00e9dical r\u00e9el du gendarme Desson, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait indiqu\u00e9 que ni son m\u00e9decin ni son psychiatre ne l\u2019avaient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 apte au travail, alors que son profil dans le syst\u00e8me indiquait toujours la cote O4. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab On aurait dit que M. Schimpf et le gendarme Desson disaient [\u00e0 la r\u00e9union dans le bureau de M. Schimpf] que son retour au travail ne sera envisag\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019on lui aura pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des options qui lui conviennent \u00bb.\n[222] Dans un courriel envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bowman le 1er octobre 2012, la sergente Parker a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Sections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales : En raison principalement des restrictions budg\u00e9taires, aucun poste vacant n\u2019est en voie d\u2019\u00eatre pourvu et, en date de la semaine derni\u00e8re, 80 postes seront supprim\u00e9s dans les sections f\u00e9d\u00e9rales. Il n\u2019est donc pas possible de lui offrir un poste dans une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\nGTI : Une demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite aupr\u00e8s du conseiller en perfectionnement et en renouvellement des ressources humaines. Le GTI a besoin de membres op\u00e9rationnels. Il n\u2019y a pas de travail \u00e0 confier \u00e0 un gendarme qui doit \u00eatre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives.\nAffaires sp\u00e9ciales O : J\u2019ai parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019inspecteur ARNOLD. Un peu plus de 60 % des membres exercent des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, compte tenu des membres en cong\u00e9 de maladie et des membres soumis \u00e0 des restrictions de travail. Il n\u2019est pas en mesure de prendre un autre membre affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives.\nD\u00e9tachement de Surrey : L\u2019inspectrice SCHWARTZ a accept\u00e9 de prendre le gendarme Desson pendant son retour progressif au travail (sur une p\u00e9riode de trois mois), mais le gendarme Desson devra retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby apr\u00e8s cette p\u00e9riode, qu\u2019il soit revenu \u00e0 temps plein ou non.\nComme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9, je n\u2019ai pas encore communiqu\u00e9 ces renseignements au gendarme DESSON. N\u2019h\u00e9sitez pas \u00e0 communiquer avec moi si vous avez des questions. J\u2019aimerais parler au gendarme DESSON bient\u00f4t, et je vous saurais gr\u00e9 de me transmettre tout nouveau renseignement que vous pourriez obtenir de la part de ses fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9.\n[223] Le 11 octobre 2012, M. Bowman a inform\u00e9 la sergente Parker qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Schimpf, qui avait r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait recommand\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson travaille dans un environnement o\u00f9 ses contacts avec des membres en uniforme seraient limit\u00e9s et qu\u2019on lui donne l\u2019assurance qu\u2019il n\u2019aura jamais \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 Burnaby. Il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de v\u00e9rifier si l\u2019environnement de travail au d\u00e9tachement de Surrey conviendrait au gendarme Desson. Le 5 novembre, il a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la sergente Parker pour lui dire qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 au psychologue du gendarme Desson, M. Schimpf, et que celui-ci \u00e9tait d\u2019avis qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du gendarme Desson qu\u2019il retourne au travail le plus t\u00f4t possible. M. Schimpf a encourag\u00e9 le gendarme Desson \u00e0 envisager s\u00e9rieusement le poste \u00e0 Surrey.\n[224] Le m\u00eame jour, la sergente Parker a inform\u00e9 le gendarme Desson que, pour des raisons budg\u00e9taires, plusieurs postes, dont des postes de m.r., \u00e9taient supprim\u00e9s ou civiliaris\u00e9s dans les secteurs d\u2019activit\u00e9 tant f\u00e9d\u00e9raux que provinciaux. Elle a dit :\n[traduction] Il n\u2019y a absolument rien de disponible dans ces deux secteurs d\u2019activit\u00e9 et, en fait, les membres dont le poste a \u00e9t\u00e9 supprim\u00e9 ou civiliaris\u00e9 sont \u00e9galement plac\u00e9s dans des d\u00e9tachements municipaux. Vous avez pos\u00e9 des questions pr\u00e9cises au sujet du GTI ou des Affaires sp\u00e9ciales O. Le [conseiller en perfectionnement et en renouvellement des ressources humaines] responsable du GTI a indiqu\u00e9 que le GTI n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure d\u2019accepter un autre membre ayant des limitations et des restrictions permanentes. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019officier responsable des op\u00e9rations secr\u00e8tes, qui m\u2019a dit la m\u00eame chose, en plus du fait qu\u2019il doit \u00e9liminer des postes.\nL\u2019un des d\u00e9tachements municipaux dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question \u00e9tait celui de Surrey. L\u2019agente administrative a accept\u00e9 que vous commenciez votre retour progressif au travail \u00e0 cet endroit. Je lui ai parl\u00e9 r\u00e9cemment, et les fonctions seront principalement associ\u00e9es aux services au comptoir, donc les demandes de renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, l\u2019\u00e9valuation des plaintes, certains travaux d\u2019enqu\u00eate, etc. Le d\u00e9tachement de Surrey est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 vous accueillir pendant trois mois (ou jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que vous travailliez 40 heures par semaine), mais vous devrez retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby par la suite. M. SCHIMPF et M. BOWMAN en ont discut\u00e9 et le message que j\u2019ai re\u00e7u, c\u2019est que vos fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 vous encouragent \u00e0 accepter ce poste. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s de chez vous, ce qui veut dire que vous n\u2019aurez pas un long trajet \u00e0 faire pour vous rendre au travail, comme vous l\u2019avez demand\u00e9. \u00c0 tout le moins, ce poste vous permettra de renouer avec le travail policier. Je suis consciente qu\u2019un retour au travail au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby n\u2019est pas ce que vous souhaitez, mais il n\u2019y a pas vraiment d\u2019autres options \u00e0 l\u2019heure actuelle. J\u2019esp\u00e8re que vous avez communiqu\u00e9 avec le surintendant AUBRY, comme vous l\u2019a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 M. SCHIMPF, pour discuter des possibilit\u00e9s qui s\u2019offrent \u00e0 vous \u00e0 cet endroit.\nJe vous encourage fortement \u00e0 accepter ce placement comme point de d\u00e9part. Comme vous le savez, la situation \u00e9volue de jour en jour \u00e0 la GRC, tout comme les priorit\u00e9s. D\u2019autres occasions pourraient se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 tout moment, mais il s\u2019agit d\u2019une bonne occasion de vous faire de nouveaux contacts, de montrer que vous \u00eates capable et de travailler \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de certains de vos objectifs.\n[225] Le 28 novembre 2012, la Dre Ross a \u00e9crit que la sergente Parker ferait un suivi aupr\u00e8s du membre au sujet du poste \u00e0 Surrey, o\u00f9 l\u2019exposition aux agents en uniforme est extr\u00eamement limit\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab M. Bowman examinera la situation \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des rapports de M. Schimpf. Si le seul facteur l\u2019emp\u00eachant de travailler est l\u2019intol\u00e9rance aux uniformes, le profil sera mis \u00e0 jour et la cote O4 lui sera attribu\u00e9e, car il s\u2019agit alors d\u2019une question de dotation. \u00bb\n[226] Le m\u00eame jour, la sergente Parker a demand\u00e9 au gendarme Desson s\u2019il avait eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner le courriel envoy\u00e9 le 5 novembre au sujet de son retour progressif au travail au d\u00e9tachement de Surrey.\n[227] Le 29 novembre 2012, le gendarme Desson a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la sergente Parker : [traduction] \u00ab Malheureusement, je ne peux excepter (accepter) ce poste ou retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. Ces postes ne conviennent pas et entrent en conflit avec les recommandations de mes fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9, qui ont recommand\u00e9 que je travaille dans un environnement non op\u00e9rationnel. \u00bb Il a ajout\u00e9 que son retour au travail n\u00e9cessitait un poste dans un environnement non op\u00e9rationnel, de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, comme le recommandait ses fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9.\n[228] Le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la sergente Parker a eu une conversation avec le caporal Ferron du d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. Dans ses notes, elle a \u00e9crit que le caporal Ferron communique avec tous ses membres en cong\u00e9 de maladie pour discuter de la fa\u00e7on dont il pouvait contribuer \u00e0 att\u00e9nuer l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 li\u00e9e au retour au travail. Il leur offre de se rendre dans les bureaux de la police communautaire par exemple pour v\u00e9rifier leurs courriels et garder contact avec d\u2019autres membres du d\u00e9tachement. Il a soulign\u00e9 que, plus le cong\u00e9 d\u2019un membre est long, plus il lui est difficile de revenir au travail. Le caporal Ferron tente \u00e9galement de conna\u00eetre les attentes des membres \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leur retour au travail, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre le mieux possible \u00e0 leurs besoins.\n[229] Le 6 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la sergente Parker a rencontr\u00e9 le sergent Nassichuk, la sergente Shepherd, le caporal Ferron, le surintendant Aubry et M. Bowman au sujet de la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour un environnement sans agents en uniforme. Tous ont convenu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une question extr\u00eamement importante pour le gendarme Desson, susceptible de mettre fin \u00e0 sa carri\u00e8re s\u2019il \u00e9tait impossible de trouver une solution acceptable. Tous ont reconnu \u00e9galement que le retour au travail apr\u00e8s une absence aussi longue serait probablement tr\u00e8s difficile, mais ils feraient tout en leur possible pour aider le gendarme Desson. Une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi \u00e0 la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du soutien op\u00e9rationnel serait offerte au gendarme Desson lors d\u2019une rencontre qui devait avoir lui la semaine suivante.\n[230] Le 10 d\u00e9cembre 2012, la sergente Parker a \u00e9crit \u00e0 M. Bowman au sujet d\u2019un poste d\u2019examinateur-analyste. Elle a \u00e9crit qu\u2019elle reconnaissait que le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait relativement novice et ne poss\u00e9dait pas encore toutes les connaissances, les comp\u00e9tences et les capacit\u00e9s qui sont normalement attendues de la personne occupant ce poste, mais qu\u2019il recevrait tout le soutien et le mentorat n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9ussir. Elle a dit qu\u2019elle connaissait bien l\u2019unit\u00e9 et qu\u2019elle pensait que le travail \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressant et ax\u00e9 sur les op\u00e9rations.\n[231] Elle a envoy\u00e9 la description de travail \u00e0 M. Bowman, qui l\u2019a transmise \u00e0 M. Schimpf. Elle a \u00e9crit que les sous-officiers portaient leur uniforme, mais pas tous les jours. [traduction] \u00ab Il y a un peu de tout. \u00bb La tenue d\u2019hiver serait exig\u00e9e, ce qui signifie que le gendarme Desson devrait porter une chemise \u00e0 manches longues, une cravate et un pantalon de ville. M\u00eame si ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la situation id\u00e9ale, elle pensait que le travail et l\u2019environnement en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pourraient \u00eatre une exp\u00e9rience tr\u00e8s positive pour lui s\u2019il parvenait \u00e0 surmonter dans une certaine mesure le probl\u00e8me des agents en uniforme.\n[232] Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2012, le gendarme Desson a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une rencontre avec M. Bowman, la sergente Parker, le sergent Nassichuk, le caporal Ferron, le surintendant Aubry et un repr\u00e9sentant de l\u2019association de la police montr\u00e9e (l\u2019ACPMP), M. Lee Keane. L\u2019objet de la rencontre \u00e9tait de faciliter le retour au travail du gendarme Desson. Toutes les personnes pr\u00e9sentes ont fait preuve d\u2019empathie et ont invit\u00e9 le gendarme Desson \u00e0 s\u2019adresser \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre d\u2019entre elles s\u2019il avait des questions ou besoin de soutien. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question qu\u2019il entreprenne un retour progressif au travail au service divisionnaire des strat\u00e9gies op\u00e9rationnelles, une nouvelle entit\u00e9 dont les bureaux se trouveraient au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral.\nb) Analyse\n[233] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette preuve, le Tribunal fait remarquer que, lorsque M. Bowman s\u2019est rendu compte que le gendarme Desson avait cess\u00e9 de prendre le m\u00e9dicament anticonvulsivant que le Dr Diggle lui avait prescrit \u00e0 vie, il lui avait recommand\u00e9 de consulter un psychiatre. Un rendez-vous lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert, mais le gendarme Desson l\u2019a refus\u00e9. Quelques mois plus tard, M. Bowman a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une autre demande pour que le gendarme Desson soit vu par un psychiatre. Le Tribunal estime que la GRC a fait les efforts n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du gendarme Desson en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 mentale en lui donnant l\u2019occasion d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9 par un sp\u00e9cialiste.\n[234] Le Tribunal conclut \u00e9galement que M. Bowman, dans son \u00e9valuation du cas du gendarme Desson, a tenu compte de sa r\u00e9action lors de son retour au travail au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. Il a \u00e9galement tenu compte de l\u2019opinion du gendarme Desson sur ce qui constituerait un placement convenable. Il a essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du gendarme Desson (environnement sans agents en uniforme, environnement non op\u00e9rationnel, pas au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby) lorsqu\u2019il a communiqu\u00e9 ses instructions au personnel de la dotation. Dans ses instructions, M. Bowman a \u00e9galement tenu compte de l\u2019opinion de M. Schimpf selon laquelle il n\u2019y avait pas de restrictions psychologiques en ce qui concerne les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales, mais certaines limitations psychologiques s\u2019appliquaient pendant la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives. M. Schimpf a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait difficile pour le gendarme Desson de travailler dans un environnement policier avec des coll\u00e8gues en uniforme qui exercent des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, parce que cela lui rappellerait ce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire. M. Schimpf a toutefois indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en fin de compte il serait profitable pour le gendarme Desson qu\u2019on lui trouve d\u2019autres fonctions convenables. Le Tribunal conclut que la GRC, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de M. Bowman et de ses instructions \u00e0 l\u2019intention du personnel de dotation, a tent\u00e9 dans la mesure du possible de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du gendarme Desson.\n[235] Entre-temps, la sergente Shepherd, \u00e0 titre d\u2019agente de dotation, a eu plusieurs conversations et une rencontre avec le gendarme Desson. Elle a essay\u00e9 de lui trouver un placement qui r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 ses besoins, tels qu\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s par M. Bowman. Elle lui a propos\u00e9 certains postes qui, \u00e0 son avis, seraient acceptables compte tenu de ses limitations et de ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences, p. ex. un poste aux services d\u2019examen avec John Bruer, un poste au sein de la section int\u00e9gr\u00e9e des produits de la criminalit\u00e9 et un poste au sein de la section des crimes graves. Les tentatives de lui trouver un poste convenable ont toutefois \u00e9chou\u00e9, puisque le gendarme Desson n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat sur le plan m\u00e9dical \u00e0 retourner au travail. Dans son t\u00e9moignage, la sergente Shepherd a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la rencontre de janvier 2012 ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas bien d\u00e9roul\u00e9e. Le gendarme Desson avait l\u2019impression qu\u2019elle le rabaissait et qu\u2019elle le traitait avec condescendance, mais la sergente Shepherd a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle essayait de l\u2019encourager \u00e0 retourner au travail. La Dre Johnson et la Dre Ross ont toutes deux affirm\u00e9 dans leur t\u00e9moignage que plus le cong\u00e9 d\u2019une personne est long, plus il lui est difficile de reprendre ses fonctions. Encore une fois, le Tribunal conclut que la GRC a essay\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins de diverses fa\u00e7ons et que ses efforts ont parfois \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us n\u00e9gativement par le gendarme Desson.\n[236] En septembre 2012, le gendarme Desson a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il aimerait occuper un poste dans une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou au sein des Affaires sp\u00e9ciales O ou du GTI. La sergente Parker, la nouvelle agente de dotation, s\u2019est inform\u00e9e, mais aucun placement n\u2019\u00e9tait possible dans ces unit\u00e9s en raison des restrictions budg\u00e9taires et de la compression des effectifs, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir un statut op\u00e9rationnel ou du nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s d\u00e9j\u00e0 assujettis \u00e0 des restrictions. Elle a propos\u00e9 au gendarme Desson un poste au d\u00e9tachement de Surrey pour une p\u00e9riode de trois mois, apr\u00e8s quoi il devait retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby. M\u00eame si le poste propos\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement de Surrey n\u2019\u00e9tait pas ce que le gendarme Desson voulait ou ce que M. Schimpf recommandait, le Tribunal constate que la GRC a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de nombreux efforts pour appuyer le retour au travail du gendarme Desson.\n[237] Compte tenu de l\u2019avis de M. Schimpf selon lequel il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du gendarme Desson de retourner au travail le plus t\u00f4t possible, M. Bowman a rencontr\u00e9 \u00e0 nouveau le gendarme Desson, en compagnie de la sergente Parker, du surintendant Aubry et d\u2019autres personnes en d\u00e9cembre 2012. Un autre poste lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert dans une nouvelle entit\u00e9 du service divisionnaire des strat\u00e9gies op\u00e9rationnelles, au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Il semblerait que cette offre ait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e acceptable par le gendarme Desson et M. Schimpf. Il en sera question \u00e0 la prochaine section.\n[238] La preuve montre que, de janvier 2011 \u00e0 janvier 2013, tandis que le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, la GRC a continu\u00e9 de d\u00e9ployer des efforts pour tenter de lui trouver un poste convenable. Elle a tenu compte des recommandations de son psychologue traitant, M. Schimpf, ainsi que de ses limitations et restrictions. En f\u00e9vrier 2013, au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 M. Schimpf l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 inapte \u00e0 travailler pour des raisons psychologiques, M. Bowman a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson lui avait dit qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis il serait possible d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer son r\u00e9tablissement si un placement professionnel convenable pouvait \u00eatre trouv\u00e9. Les efforts pour lui trouver un placement professionnel se sont donc poursuivis. M. Schimpf a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que le gendarme Desson ne soit pas plac\u00e9 dans un environnement policier o\u00f9 travaillent des agents en uniforme qui exercent des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, parce que cela lui rappellerait ce qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas faire et aggraverait son \u00e9tat.\n[239] Dans les efforts qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour trouver un poste acceptable pour le gendarme Desson, la GRC a tenu compte de la recommandation de M. Schimpf, m\u00eame si cette recommandation limitait consid\u00e9rablement les chances de trouver un placement professionnel acceptable.\n[240] En fait, en ao\u00fbt 2011, M. Bowman a renvoy\u00e9 le gendarme Desson \u00e0 une agente du d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby pour discuter d\u2019un placement hors d\u00e9tachement.\n[241] En octobre 2011, la sergente Shepherd avait un poste \u00e0 lui offrir aux services d\u2019examen, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e que le gendarme Desson n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 entreprendre un retour progressif au travail. En f\u00e9vrier 2012, elle a \u00e9crit au gendarme Desson pour l\u2019informer qu\u2019il y avait quelques postes convenant \u00e0 un retour progressif au travail \u00e0 la section des crimes graves, mais il n\u2019\u00e9tait toujours pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail. La preuve montre qu\u2019il n\u2019arrivait tout simplement pas \u00e0 accepter la d\u00e9cision selon laquelle il \u00e9tait inapte aux t\u00e2ches op\u00e9rationnelles, ce qui minait chaque fois les efforts de la GRC pour lui trouver un placement acceptable.\n[242] Le gendarme Desson a aussi exig\u00e9 de ne pas retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, o\u00f9 il travaillait auparavant, parce que ce serait g\u00eanant et difficile pour lui de retourner travailler \u00e0 cet endroit, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les gens savaient qu\u2019il avait eu une crise et qu\u2019il aurait honte. Le GRC a tenu compte des sentiments de g\u00eane et de honte du gendarme Desson dans ses tentatives de lui trouver un placement professionnel, comme M. Schimpf l\u2019avait sugg\u00e9r\u00e9. En effet, M. Schimpf a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes occasions qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de restrictions psychologiques en ce qui concerne les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales, mais que, dans le cadre d\u2019un retour progressif au travail, le gendarme Desson aurait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans un environnement policier, car cela lui rappellerait ce qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 faire. Toutefois, M. Schimpf a aussi indiqu\u00e9 que si on pouvait lui trouver des fonctions convenables, cela serait en fin de compte profitable pour lui. La GRC en a tenu compte. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la plupart des postes se trouvent dans un environnement policier, la GRC a fait des efforts pour trouver une solution qui r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 ces besoins, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s par M. Bowman ou d\u2019autres. Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la GRC a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de grands efforts pour tenter de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du gendarme Desson et de lui trouver un placement convenable.\n[243] Par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de M. Bowman, la GRC a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 de nombreux efforts pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins du gendarme Desson et respecter ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences. M. Bowman a press\u00e9 la sergente Shepherd d\u2019accorder la priorit\u00e9 au placement du gendarme Desson, parce qu\u2019il avait [traduction] \u00ab naturellement beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 tol\u00e9rer l\u2019incertitude entourant sa situation \u00bb. La sergente Shepherd a eu des conversations et une rencontre avec le gendarme Desson pour discuter non seulement des postes disponibles, mais aussi des postes qui l\u2019int\u00e9ressaient. Elle essayait de trouver un poste qui serait gratifiant pour lui. Elle essayait de l\u2019encourager \u00e0 retourner au travail et \u00e9tait pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire des efforts en ce sens. Le Tribunal conclut que la GRC a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 une pr\u00e9occupation r\u00e9elle non seulement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des int\u00e9r\u00eats professionnels en jeu, mais aussi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des int\u00e9r\u00eats personnels du gendarme Desson.\n[244] Lors de la rencontre qui a eu lieu au d\u00e9but de 2012, le gendarme Desson a eu l\u2019impression que la sergente Shepherd le rabaissait et qu\u2019elle le traitait avec condescendance. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, la sergente Shepherd a r\u00e9fut\u00e9 ces propos et a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle essayait de l\u2019aider. Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que, pour d\u00e9cider si la GRC avait pris les mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du gendarme Desson, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019aborder la question de savoir qui a raison. Ce qui importe, c\u2019est le fait que la rencontre a eu lieu et que ce fait constitue un autre exemple des efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s par la GRC pour trouver un emploi convenable au gendarme Desson, m\u00eame si ces efforts ont \u00e9t\u00e9 per\u00e7us n\u00e9gativement par le gendarme Desson. Le Tribunal note que, dans son t\u00e9moignage, le gendarme Desson se stigmatisait lui-m\u00eame en raison de son \u00e9tat \u00e9pileptique.\n[245] Les sergentes Shepherd et Parker, qui ont pris en charge la recherche d\u2019un placement en vue du retour progressif au travail du gendarme Desson, ont fait de leur mieux pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses besoins et \u00e0 ses d\u00e9sirs. De nombreuses possibilit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9es. Le gendarme Desson aurait aim\u00e9 faire un retour progressif au travail dans une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, mais, comme la sergente Parker l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 le 1er octobre 2012, c\u2019\u00e9tait impossible en raison des restrictions budg\u00e9taires et de la compression des effectifs. Le contexte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque faisait \u00e9galement en sorte qu\u2019un placement dans d\u2019autres sections \u00e9tait impossible (GTI, Affaires sp\u00e9ciales O). Il y avait une possibilit\u00e9 au d\u00e9tachement de Surrey, mais encore une fois ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une option viable, parce qu\u2019au bout de trois mois le gendarme Desson aurait d\u00fb retourner au d\u00e9tachement de Burnaby, o\u00f9 il avait honte de retourner. La GRC en a tenu compte et a continu\u00e9 de faire des efforts pour lui trouver un placement convenable.\n[246] Le Tribunal conclut que, en tentant de trouver un poste administratif convenant \u00e0 un retour progressif au travail au cours de la p\u00e9riode de janvier 2011 \u00e0 janvier 2013, alors que le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie, la GRC a r\u00e9pondu aux besoins du gendarme Desson et respect\u00e9 ses pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences autant que possible. Le Tribunal estime que l\u2019obligation de la GRC n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de cr\u00e9er un emploi. L\u2019affecter \u00e0 une section f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, au GTI ou aux Affaires sp\u00e9ciales O aurait constitu\u00e9 une contrainte excessive pour l\u2019employeur, compte tenu des explications donn\u00e9es par la sergente Parker dans son courriel du 1er octobre 2012.\n[247] Il convient \u00e9galement de noter que M. Bowman a insist\u00e9 pour que le gendarme Desson soit vu par un psychiatre en raison de son \u00e9tat mental et qu\u2019il a pris des mesures pour qu\u2019il obtienne un rendez-vous. Selon le Tribunal, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une autre preuve que la GRC avait sinc\u00e8rement l\u2019intention d\u2019aider le gendarme Desson.\nDe f\u00e9vrier 2013 \u00e0 mai 2015\na) Faits\n[248] Le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2013, M. Bowman a \u00e9crit qu\u2019il avait parl\u00e9 au fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 du gendarme Desson, qui \u00e9tait favorable \u00e0 ce que celui-ci entame progressivement un retour au travail.\n[249] Le m\u00eame jour, la Dre Ross a mentionn\u00e9 que, puisque l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tait un facteur important, il serait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que le membre travaille des demi-journ\u00e9es tous les jours, au lieu d\u2019avoir des jours de cong\u00e9 entre ses quarts de travail.\n[250] Enfin, le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2013, le gendarme Desson a amorc\u00e9 un retour progressif au travail au sein du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles, au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division E, dans un r\u00f4le administratif.\n[251] Dans son rapport du 11 mars 2013, M. Schimpf a mentionn\u00e9 que le gendarme Desson avait fait des progr\u00e8s [traduction] \u00ab attribuables au fait qu\u2019il effectue un retour progressif au travail (dans le cadre duquel il effectue des t\u00e2ches se rapportant \u00e0 la fourniture de services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans un nouvel immeuble du quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division E) et qu\u2019il se sent optimiste \u00bb. Le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait assujetti aux restrictions professionnelles suivantes :\n[traduction] Il n\u2019y a pas de restrictions psychologiques en ce qui concerne les fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales, mais il y a une interdiction m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard (voir ci-dessus). La question de la modification des t\u00e2ches est complexe, car le membre a obtenu l\u2019autorisation m\u00e9dicale d\u2019effectuer des t\u00e2ches administratives, mais c\u2019est ici que les limitations psychologiques deviennent pertinentes. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le membre se d\u00e9finit en termes de prouesses physiques et athl\u00e9tiques, et il est extr\u00eamement difficile pour lui d\u2019\u00eatre emp\u00each\u00e9 de faire ce qui l\u2019a amen\u00e9 \u00e0 devenir policier. Il aura donc beaucoup de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 travailler dans un environnement policier qui lui rappelle constamment rappeler ce qu\u2019il n\u2019est plus capable de faire, mais en m\u00eame temps si on pouvait lui trouver des fonctions convenables, cela serait en fin de compte profitable pour lui. Je recommande donc que le membre ne soit pas affect\u00e9 dans un d\u00e9tachement o\u00f9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019agents de police exer\u00e7ant des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles (en uniforme) lui rappellerait sa situation et aggraverait son \u00e9tat. Cela \u00e9tant dit, le plan actuel de retour au travail (qui consiste \u00e0 fournir des services de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au nouveau quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division E) est relativement bien accueilli par le membre et est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une bonne option.\n(Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[252] Le 22 avril 2013, le caporal Eric Sheppard a inform\u00e9 la Dre Ross qu\u2019il y avait une possibilit\u00e9 de placement dans son unit\u00e9 (sous-officier de service au sein du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles). Il a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 ce que je vois, il pourrait y avoir un terrain d\u2019entente qui pourrait r\u00e9pondre aux aspirations du membre ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 vos pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de son statut op\u00e9rationnel. Le groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles est unique et pourrait convenir \u00e0 Mike au cours des prochaines ann\u00e9es. \u00bb\n[253] Le 23 avril 2013, la Dre Ross a r\u00e9pondu au caporal Sheppard pour l\u2019informer que le profil m\u00e9dical associ\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019emploi en question comportait la cote O2 (fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales) alors que la cote O4 (fonctions administratives seulement) serait attribu\u00e9e au gendarme Desson jusqu\u2019en juillet 2015. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la cote O4 ne permet pas au membre d\u2019\u00eatre en uniforme en public ou de porter une arme \u00e0 feu dans le contexte du travail policier (c.-\u00e0-d. lorsqu\u2019il est en service). Elle a fait quelques suggestions. Elle a propos\u00e9 que la cote associ\u00e9e au poste soit modifi\u00e9e et qu\u2019il soit confirm\u00e9 que le port d\u2019un uniforme ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu n\u2019\u00e9tait pas requis. Subsidiairement, si une partie des t\u00e2ches n\u00e9cessitait le port d\u2019un uniforme ou d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu, elle a propos\u00e9 que les gestionnaires regroupent les t\u00e2ches du poste de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que le membre puisse s\u2019acquitter des t\u00e2ches non op\u00e9rationnelles. En fin de compte, cette possibilit\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas concr\u00e9tis\u00e9e.\n[254] Le 7 janvier 2014, le caporal Sheppard, qui \u00e9tait le superviseur du gendarme Desson dans le cadre de son retour progressif au travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a \u00e9crit \u00e0 la sergente Parker et \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes :\n[traduction] Dans le cadre de ses fonctions, il a grandement contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 des op\u00e9rations et a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s r\u00e9ceptif et motiv\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son perfectionnement personnel en tant que membre (du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019administration et de la gestion du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles). Depuis son arriv\u00e9e, j\u2019ai r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper les capacit\u00e9s du gendarme Desson \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de plusieurs de nos comp\u00e9tences organisationnelles et fonctionnelles, au sein du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles et par l\u2019entremise du Secr\u00e9tariat des enqu\u00eates criminelles. Je suis d\u2019avis que Mike est sur la bonne voie en ce qui a trait \u00e0 son perfectionnement, compte tenu de ses restrictions. Le groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles\/enqu\u00eates criminelles lui fournit \u00e9galement des renseignements \u00e0 jour sur l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel des op\u00e9rations au sein de la Force (proximit\u00e9 imm\u00e9diate des enqu\u00eates criminelles) tout en \u00e9tant attach\u00e9 \u00e0 une unit\u00e9 en uniforme (le groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles). Je crois fermement que son r\u00f4le actuel au sein de mon unit\u00e9 lui donne l\u2019occasion de bien pr\u00e9parer son retour aux op\u00e9rations et son avenir en tant que superviseur.\nJe suis tout \u00e0 fait en faveur du maintien en poste du gendarme Desson au sein du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles du quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division E pour toute la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle il aura la cote O4, apr\u00e8s quoi nous pourrons r\u00e9\u00e9valuer la situation lorsque son profil fera l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e9examen en juillet 2015.\n[255] Le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2014, le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs a examin\u00e9 le dossier et a conclu que, selon les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux disponibles, l\u2019interdiction d\u2019exercer des fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles devait \u00eatre maintenue, y compris en ce qui concernait l\u2019utilisation d\u2019une arme \u00e0 feu. Il a ajout\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 l\u2019heure actuelle, nous ne disposons pas de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux qui justifieraient la prise de mesures sp\u00e9ciales ou l\u2019application d\u2019une exception, compte tenu des pratiques m\u00e9dicales exemplaires en place. Le faire serait \u00e9galement injuste pour les autres membres qui se trouvent dans une situation comparable, mais qui n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet de mesures sp\u00e9ciales. Si une exception \u00e9tait accord\u00e9e dans ce dossier, il y aurait un risque \u00e9vident pour les membres et la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019organisation serait engag\u00e9e. \u00bb\n[256] Le 20 ao\u00fbt 2014, le gendarme Desson a demand\u00e9 une rencontre avec la Dre Ross pour discuter [traduction] \u00ab des politiques et du profil m\u00e9dical tir\u00e9s des crit\u00e8res du profil m\u00e9dical du Manuel d\u2019administration de la GRC et se rapportant au statut op\u00e9rationnel des membres. La rencontre sera l\u2019occasion de tenter d\u2019arriver \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution rapide de mes griefs en cours \u00bb. Le gendarme Desson a joint \u00e0 son courriel un document expliquant son point de vue sur la question des restrictions qui s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 lui et sur la politique de cinq ans.\n[257] Il a \u00e9galement comment\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse du comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le fait que le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs avait mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait injuste pour les autres membres qu\u2019on fasse une exception dans son cas d\u00e9montrait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 individuellement. Il a \u00e9crit :\n[traduction] Chaque membre doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 individuellement, et donc l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers les autres membres ne devrait pas entrer en ligne de compte. Aucun membre, y compris moi-m\u00eame, ne devrait \u00eatre compar\u00e9 \u00e0 un autre membre, comme je l\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9. En janvier 2011, une semaine avant la date \u00e0 laquelle je devais recommencer \u00e0 exercer l\u2019ensemble de mes fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles, la Dre ROSS m\u2019a t\u00e9l\u00e9phon\u00e9 et m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de me rendre \u00e0 son bureau au quartier g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Division E pour une rencontre. Au cours de la rencontre, la Dre ROSS m\u2019a dit que je ne pourrais pas recommencer \u00e0 exercer l\u2019ensemble de mes fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles avant cinq ans. La Dre ROSS s\u2019est excus\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait tromp\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle ne comprenait pas parfaitement la politique m\u00e9dicale de la GRC concernant les crises. La Dre ROSS a ensuite affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019un membre de sexe f\u00e9minin avait \u00e9galement fait des crises, mais que ses fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 refusaient de la d\u00e9clar\u00e9 apte au travail, ce qui l\u2019avait m\u00e9lang\u00e9e, puisque dans mon cas mes fournisseurs de soins de sant\u00e9 m\u2019avaient autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 exercer mes fonctions.\n[258] La Dre Ross a r\u00e9pondu le m\u00eame jour qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas revenir sur la question. Elle a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai utilis\u00e9 toutes mes capacit\u00e9s verbales et \u00e9crites pour communiquer la politique de la GRC concernant votre \u00e9tat. Je ne sais pas comment d\u2019autre m\u2019y prendre. Si je n\u2019ai pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de clarifier la situation jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, je n\u2019y arriverai pas. \u00bb Elle lui a envoy\u00e9 une copie de la r\u00e9ponse fournie par le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2014.\n[259] Le gendarme Desson a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il donnerait suite \u00e0 ses griefs, \u00e0 ses plaintes au Coll\u00e8ge des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens ou \u00e0 tout litige civil qu\u2019il pourrait intenter. Il a exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9saccord avec le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs et a fait valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 individuellement.\n[260] Le 22 ao\u00fbt 2014, la Dre Ross a inform\u00e9 le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs qu\u2019elle pensait que le gendarme Desson serait plus heureux si un autre m\u00e9decin-chef s\u2019occupait de son dossier.\n[261] En septembre 2014, la Dre Fieschi a pris la rel\u00e8ve de la Dre Ross pour s\u2019occuper du dossier du gendarme Desson. Elle a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au gendarme Desson pour lui demander de faire remplir certains documents avant qu\u2019il reprenne ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles en juillet 2015. Elle a mentionn\u00e9 que les documents devaient \u00eatre remplis dans les six mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le retour aux fonctions normales.\n[262] Entre-temps, en septembre 2014, le conseiller en perfectionnement et en renouvellement des ressources humaines de la Division E, le caporal Mike Liu, a v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 le statut op\u00e9rationnel du gendarme Desson, parce qu\u2019on cherchait \u00e0 doter un poste au sein du Programme de protection des transporteurs a\u00e9riens canadiens, qui aurait pu \u00eatre offert au gendarme Desson s\u2019il avait la cote O2 (fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales).\n[263] Le 29 d\u00e9cembre 2014, la Dre Fieschi a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2014, j\u2019ai discut\u00e9 de la situation de ce membre avec le Dr Marc-Andr\u00e9 Beaulieu, directeur m\u00e9dical par int\u00e9rim de la SDSST, \u00e0 Ottawa, qui s\u2019adonne \u00e0 \u00eatre un neurologue sp\u00e9cialiste de l\u2019\u00e9pilepsie. Malheureusement, le Dr Beaulieu sera mut\u00e9 \u00e0 un nouveau poste \u00e0 l\u2019Agence de la sant\u00e9 publique du Canada dans quelques jours. Il a toutefois fourni une r\u00e9troaction utile.\nSans mentionner le nom du membre, je lui ai donn\u00e9 un aper\u00e7u des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de crises du membre, j\u2019ai lui ai donn\u00e9 les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019IRM et de l\u2019EEG au dossier et je lui ai transmis les opinions de ses neurologues, y compris le fait qu\u2019ils estiment que les crises du membre avaient des d\u00e9clencheurs pr\u00e9cis. Je lui ai expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au d\u00e9part la Dre Ross avait uniquement interdit au membre de conduire dans un contexte op\u00e9rationnel, mais que c\u2019\u00e9tait une erreur et qu\u2019elle avait rapidement d\u00fb lui interdire d\u2019exercer l\u2019ensemble de ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles en raison d\u2019une discussion nationale sur les membres ayant eu des crises, conform\u00e9ment aux lignes directrices r\u00e9dig\u00e9es par le Dr Beaulieu lui-m\u00eame.\nLe Dr Beaulieu a dit que le fait que le membre n\u2019a pas eu de crise depuis environ quatre ans et demi, depuis qu\u2019il prend des m\u00e9dicaments, est rassurant, et que le traitement semble lui permettre d\u2019\u00e9viter les crises, qu\u2019il y ait eu d\u2019autres d\u00e9clencheurs ou non. Il a dit que le fait que le membre suit son traitement est \u00e9galement rassurant. Selon lui, le membre risque clairement de faire d\u2019autres crises s\u2019il cesse de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments, puisque l\u2019EEG montre une d\u00e9charge partielle.\nIl a dit que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il se sera bient\u00f4t \u00e9coul\u00e9 cinq ans depuis la derni\u00e8re crise, il envisagerait de r\u00e9int\u00e9grer le membre dans ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles quelques mois \u00e0 l\u2019avance, sous r\u00e9serve d\u2019une r\u00e9\u00e9valuation finale par le neurologue, qui devrait comprendre un nouvel EEG, la confirmation que la dose de m\u00e9dicaments est th\u00e9rapeutique et un avis clair et r\u00e9cent du neurologue selon lequel le membre ne pr\u00e9sente pas un risque accru d\u2019incapacit\u00e9. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 si un nouvel examen par IRM devrait \u00eatre effectu\u00e9, et il a r\u00e9pondu que la d\u00e9cision revenait au neurologue, qui pourrait d\u00e9cider d\u2019en effectuer un pour s\u2019assurer que rien n\u2019a chang\u00e9 depuis le premier examen par IRM, dont les r\u00e9sultats \u00e9taient normaux. Il a ajout\u00e9 que si un examen par IRM est effectu\u00e9, il devrait \u00eatre rehauss\u00e9 au gadolinium.\nJe lui ai aussi demand\u00e9 s\u2019il aurait autoris\u00e9 ce membre \u00e0 reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles apr\u00e8s trois ans si on lui avait pos\u00e9 la question. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il aurait certainement voulu qu\u2019un examen par IRM soit effectu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, mais qu\u2019il ne l\u2019aurait probablement pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 reprendre l\u2019ensemble de ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 en raison de la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019une d\u00e9charge \u00e9pileptique partielle montr\u00e9e par l\u2019EEG. \u00c0 ce stade-ci, le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis la derni\u00e8re crise donne \u00e0 penser que l\u2019\u00e9tat du membre est stable, ce qui est rassurant. Pour cette raison, il envisagerait la possibilit\u00e9 que le membre retourne sur le terrain quelques mois avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans.\n[264] Le 19 janvier 2015, elle a inform\u00e9 le gendarme Desson de sa conversation avec le Dr Beaulieu et lui a dit qu\u2019il pourrait reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales avant juillet 2015. Elle a demand\u00e9 les documents m\u00e9dicaux n\u00e9cessaires pour modifier son statut op\u00e9rationnel. Elle l\u2019a \u00e9galement inform\u00e9 que si, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, il changeait de m\u00e9dicaments ou cessait de prendre ses m\u00e9dicaments, il serait r\u00e9affect\u00e9 \u00e0 des t\u00e2ches administratives (O4) pour une p\u00e9riode d\u2019au moins six mois au cours de laquelle il ne devait avoir aucune crise. Les renseignements m\u00e9dicaux \u00e9taient n\u00e9cessaires pour lui permettre de reprendre ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles.\n[265] Le 26 mai 2015, le gendarme Desson a repris ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales.\nb) Analyse\n[266] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette preuve, le Tribunal conclut que, en ce qui concerne la p\u00e9riode de f\u00e9vrier 2013 \u00e0 mai 2015, la GRC a pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du gendarme Desson sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 subir une contrainte excessive.\n[267] En effet, la GRC a tenu compte de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 du gendarme Desson lorsqu\u2019il a entam\u00e9 son retour progressif au travail en f\u00e9vrier 2013, car la Dre Ross a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il travaille des demi-journ\u00e9es tous les jours, au lieu d\u2019avoir des jours de cong\u00e9 entre ses quarts de travail, ce qui serait mieux pour sa sant\u00e9.\n[268] En 2013, la Dre Ross et le caporal Sheppard ont essay\u00e9 d\u2019organiser un placement au sein du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard duquel le gendarme Desson avait manifest\u00e9 de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat. Le poste en question exigeait le statut op\u00e9rationnel, mais m\u00eame si le gendarme Desson \u00e9tait toujours limit\u00e9 aux t\u00e2ches administratives, des discussions ont eu lieu entre la Dre Ross et le caporal Shepard \u00e0 ce sujet. Le Tribunal y voit un autre indice de la bonne volont\u00e9 de la GRC de r\u00e9pondre aux aspirations du gendarme Desson.\n[269] Le gendarme Desson a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la GRC ne l\u2019avait pas \u00e9valu\u00e9 individuellement, mais qu\u2019elle avait appliqu\u00e9 une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale sans tenir compte de son affection particuli\u00e8re. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, le Tribunal ne peut pas accepter ce point de vue. La GRC a tent\u00e9 de bien des fa\u00e7ons de r\u00e9pondre aux aspirations et aux d\u00e9sirs du gendarme Desson. En 2014, lorsqu\u2019un emploi au sein du groupe des interventions op\u00e9rationnelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9, le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs a examin\u00e9 le dossier du gendarme Desson. Il a conclu qu\u2019aucun renseignement m\u00e9dical ne justifiait que les restrictions li\u00e9es au statut op\u00e9rationnel du membre soient lev\u00e9es un an avant la fin de la p\u00e9riode de cinq ans. Le fait que le comit\u00e9 de m\u00e9decins-chefs a mentionn\u00e9, dans sa d\u00e9cision de refuser de modifier la cote op\u00e9rationnelle du membre en 2014, que ce serait injuste pour les autres membres et que la responsabilit\u00e9 de la GRC serait engag\u00e9e ne change rien au fait que, tout au long des ann\u00e9es 2010 \u00e0 2015, le gendarme Desson a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 et trait\u00e9 individuellement.\n[270] En fin de compte, aucune des d\u00e9marches entreprises n\u2019a abouti, mais le Tribunal fait remarquer que la GRC essayait toujours de trouver un emploi qui r\u00e9pondrait aux aspirations du gendarme Desson.\n[271] En conclusion, le Tribunal conclut que la GRC a prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du gendarme Desson sans aller jusqu\u2019\u00e0 subir une contrainte excessive pendant toute la p\u00e9riode comprise entre juillet 2010, date \u00e0 laquelle le gendarme Desson a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019un accident caus\u00e9 par une crise d\u2019\u00e9pilepsie, et mai 2015, date \u00e0 laquelle il a repris ses fonctions op\u00e9rationnelles normales.\n[272] Par cons\u00e9quent, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question D est oui. La GRC a prouv\u00e9 que la politique de cinq ans constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e au sens des paragraphes 15(1) et 15(2) de la LCDP.\nE. Si non, quelles sont les mesures de r\u00e9paration applicables?\n[273] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la GRC a prouv\u00e9 que la politique de cinq ans constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de discuter des mesures de r\u00e9paration. Par cons\u00e9quent, aucun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour justifier les mesures de r\u00e9paration, y compris les effets \u00e0 long terme de l\u2019application de la politique de cinq ans, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire apr\u00e8s mai 2015, ne sera analys\u00e9.\nF. La GRC a-t-elle adopt\u00e9 un comportement abusif et commis une entrave en ne divulguant certains documents qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019audience?\n[274] Le plaignant demande une indemnit\u00e9 pour les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation. Certains documents cl\u00e9s n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s qu\u2019au cours de l\u2019audience, qui a dur\u00e9 30 jours. L\u2019audience a commenc\u00e9 le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2021 et s\u2019est conclue le 8 d\u00e9cembre 2021. Les parties ont ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs arguments \u00e9crits, et le Tribunal a pris l\u2019affaire en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 apr\u00e8s avril 2022.\n[275] Le 11 juillet 2021, les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021) (2021-06-03, Gazette du Canada, partie II, vol. 155, no 13) (les \u00ab nouvelles r\u00e8gles \u00bb) sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur pour toutes les nouvelles proc\u00e9dures. Les nouvelles r\u00e8gles ne s\u2019appliquent pas aux affaires renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal avant le 11 juillet 2011, \u00e0 moins que toutes les parties consentent \u00e0 leur application.\n[276] Puisque l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire a d\u00e9but\u00e9 le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2021, ce sont les anciennes R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04) qui s\u2019appliquent.\n[277] Aux termes des alin\u00e9as 6(1)d) et 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles, chaque partie doit notamment signifier et d\u00e9poser la liste des divers documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession et qui sont pertinents \u00e0 un fait, une question ou une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e en l\u2019occurrence, y compris les faits, les questions et les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties en vertu de l\u2019article 6.\n[278] Chaque partie doit \u00e9galement fournir aux autres parties, en vertu du paragraphe 6(4), une copie des documents \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans cette liste, sauf s\u2019ils sont confidentiels.\n[279] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit que les documents doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s s\u2019ils sont potentiellement pertinents. Cette norme n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement difficile \u00e0 satisfaire pour la partie requ\u00e9rante : \u00ab S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties en cause, les renseignements devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s [\u2026] \u00bb (Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2017 TCDP 28, au par. 6 [Brickner[). Toutefois, la demande ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb (Guay c. Canada (Gendarmerie royale du Canada), 2004 TCDP 34, au par. 43). Les documents demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise (Brickner, au par. 7) et doivent \u00eatre des documents qui sont en la possession de la partie, auxquels elle a acc\u00e8s et\/ou dont elle a le contr\u00f4le (Clegg c. Air Canada, 2019 TCDP 3, aux par. 84 \u00e0 88). Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne peut ordonner \u00e0 une partie de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ou de cr\u00e9er des documents aux fins de la divulgation (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 42, au par. 17).\n[280] En principe, les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 assurer l\u2019instruction non-formaliste et rapide des affaires, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 1(1). Elles ont pour objet d\u2019aider les parties \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne de mani\u00e8re rapide, efficace et \u00e9quitable.\n[281] En application du paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi, le Tribunal doit donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve.\n[282] Il est donc \u00e9vident que les documents doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience.\n[283] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, certains documents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audience, et le plaignant r\u00e9clame une indemnit\u00e9 pour entrave au processus d\u00e9cisionnel.\n[284] Le 11e jour de l\u2019audience, soit le 4 mai 2021, pendant le contre-interrogatoire du gendarme Desson, qui avait commenc\u00e9 le 4e jour de l\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a inform\u00e9 le plaignant et le Tribunal que, pendant la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019un de ses t\u00e9moins (le Dr Beaulieu) quelques jours avant l\u2019audience du 4 mai 2021, il avait eu connaissance d\u2019un nouveau document pertinent qui n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9.\n[285] Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un document de 187 pages extrait des dossiers de gestion de cas du SIGSS. Ce document concerne le plaignant et comprend des notes et des conversations li\u00e9es en partie \u00e0 la gestion de son dossier m\u00e9dical et \u00e0 l\u2019application de la politique de cinq ans \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Ces renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s dans le syst\u00e8me par le m\u00e9decin-chef et \u00e9taient confidentiels, sauf pour l\u2019\u00e9quipe du m\u00e9decin-chef.\n[286] Le document de 187 pages renvoie \u00e0 83 pi\u00e8ces jointes (fichiers PDF) qui ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 produites par l\u2019intim\u00e9e le 17e jour de l\u2019audience, soit le 29 juin 2021, lorsque le plaignant a clos sa preuve.\n[287] Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a entrav\u00e9 le processus d\u00e9cisionnel. Il renvoie \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2019 TCDP 1 (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien), rendue par le Tribunal, et \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Tipple c. Canada, 2012 CAF 158 [Tipple], rendu par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[288] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, le Tribunal a reconnu qu\u2019il demeurait li\u00e9 par l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53, o\u00f9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a jug\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir d\u2019adjuger des d\u00e9pens aux plaignants ayant eu gain de cause au titre des \u00ab \u201cd\u00e9penses entra\u00een\u00e9es par l\u2019acte [discriminatoire]\u201d aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP \u00bb. C\u2019est la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale.\n[289] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, le Tribunal a affirm\u00e9 que les d\u00e9pens demand\u00e9s dans cette affaire en raison de la conduite abusive ou de l\u2019entrave en cause ne d\u00e9coulaient pas du pouvoir du Tribunal d\u2019accorder le remboursement de d\u00e9penses en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP, mais plut\u00f4t de ce que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9crit dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Tipple comme \u00ab le pouvoir inh\u00e9rent d\u2019un tribunal de contr\u00f4ler sa propre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb.\n[290] Ces deux d\u00e9cisions concernent des faits tr\u00e8s particuliers.\n[291] En effet, dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, les parties avaient d\u00e9pos\u00e9 conjointement une requ\u00eate \u00e9crite aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal dans le but d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance sur consentement selon laquelle le Canada verserait une indemnit\u00e9 aux plaignants et \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e en raison de son entrave au d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal en 2013, comme convenu entre les parties.\n[292] Dans cette affaire, les parties reconnaissaient que le Canada avait sciemment omis de divulguer 90 000 documents, dont certains \u00e9taient pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 sa cause et tr\u00e8s pertinents, et le Tribunal a conclu que le Canada avait omis de l\u2019aviser et d\u2019aviser les parties de ce fait \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion. Les plaignants et la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e ont engag\u00e9 des frais inutilement en raison de la divulgation tardive de ces 90 000 documents par le Canada et du report de trois mois de l\u2019audience sur le fond qui en a d\u00e9coul\u00e9.\n[293] Dans l\u2019affaire Tipple, le minist\u00e8re des Travaux publics et des Services gouvernementaux du Canada (TPSGC), l\u2019intim\u00e9, avait commis une entrave en refusant de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e de respecter les ordonnances de divulgation du Tribunal, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 pour M. Tipple des frais juridiques inutiles pour faire ex\u00e9cuter les ordonnances de l\u2019arbitre. TPSGC a adopt\u00e9 un comportement l\u2019amenant \u00e0 s\u2019ex\u00e9cuter tardivement et de fa\u00e7on insuffisante, et il n\u2019a rem\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 ce comportement qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite d\u2019une pression incessante exerc\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de M. Tipple.\n[294] Les faits sur lesquels reposent la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et l\u2019arr\u00eat Tipple sont tr\u00e8s diff\u00e9rents de ceux de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[295] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les parties n\u2019admettent pas toutes que la GRC a adopt\u00e9 un comportement abusif, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, et il n\u2019y a non plus aucune preuve de comportement abusif ou d\u2019entrave de la part de la GRC, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019affaire Tipple. En fait, l\u2019avocat de la GRC a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et le plaignant d\u00e8s qu\u2019il s\u2019est rendu compte de l\u2019existence du document du SIGSS, pendant qu\u2019il pr\u00e9parait un de ses t\u00e9moins au cours de l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal se serait attendu \u00e0 ce que ces renseignements importants aient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couverts et divulgu\u00e9s avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, mais il estime que l\u2019omission est probablement attribuable \u00e0 un manque de pr\u00e9paration et \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte tardive du document ou \u00e0 une erreur de bonne foi. Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la GRC n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 intentionnellement un comportement abusif ou commis intentionnellement une entrave, comme dans les affaires Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et Tipple.\n[296] De plus, une bonne partie du document du SIGSS avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e dans les deux volumes du recueil conjoint de documents.\n[297] Le Tribunal estime que les d\u00e9cisions Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien et Tipple sont tr\u00e8s particuli\u00e8res et sont fond\u00e9es sur des faits tr\u00e8s particuliers, qui sont exceptionnels. Les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce sont diff\u00e9rents.\n[298] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019aucuns d\u00e9pens ne seront adjug\u00e9s.\nG. Si oui, le plaignant a-t-il droit \u00e0 une indemnit\u00e9?\n[299] Compte tenu de la conclusion qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, aucune indemnit\u00e9 n\u2019est accord\u00e9e au plaignant.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMarie Langlois\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe\n10 janvier 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT2276\/3118\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nMichael Eric Desson c Gendarmerie royale du Canada\nDate de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal : Le\n10 janvier 2023\nDates et lieu de l\u2019audience :\n23 et 24 f\u00e9vrier 2021\n30 mars et 1 er avril 2021\n26-29 avril 2021\n3-6 mai 2021\n26-28 mai 2021\n29 juin 2021\n6-8 juillet 2021\n20-21 juillet 2021\n26-27 juillet 2021\n28-29 septembre 2021\n3-5 novembre 2021\n7-8 d\u00e9cembre 2021\n4 avril 2022\nPar vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence\nComparutions :\nJeff Sanders, pour\nle plaignant\nGraham Stark, pour\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e",

Aper\u00e7u [1] La plaignante, Christina Gagno, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la \u00ab GRC \u00bb), de communiquer :\nA) toute copie non caviard\u00e9e des notes d\u2019agents de police et des rapports d\u2019incidents se rapportant aux interactions entre la plaignante et l\u2019intim\u00e9e qui ont conduit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte;\nB) tout contrat ou accord intervenu entre l\u2019intim\u00e9e et des fournisseurs de services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation en langue des signes depuis ao\u00fbt 2015;\nC) la documentation aff\u00e9rente au Programme de formation des cadets de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, en date du 20 octobre 2021.\n[2] Le 9 novembre 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a communiqu\u00e9 les documents vis\u00e9s au point C, et la plaignante ne fait plus valoir cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la requ\u00eate.\nII. Contexte [3] La plaignante, qui est sourde, all\u00e8gue qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e du fait que cette derni\u00e8re a omis de prendre des mesures pour retenir les services d\u2019un interpr\u00e8te en langue des signes lorsqu\u2019un de ses agents l\u2019a rencontr\u00e9 en ao\u00fbt 2015 \u00e0 Langley, en Colombie-Britannique.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet qu\u2019elle a fait preuve de discrimination envers la plaignante. Les parties ont commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9changer des documents et ont r\u00e9dig\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, dans l\u2019optique de possiblement acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le r\u00e8glement de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.

Analyse [5] Il est important de rappeler l\u2019objet des exigences en mati\u00e8re de communications. Les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments (par. 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb)). Elles ont notamment comprend le droit \u00e0 la communication de tous les renseignements potentiellement pertinents d\u00e9tenus par la partie adverse, de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que chaque partie connaisse la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et puisse se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audience. Voir la d\u00e9cision Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2019 TCDP 8, au par. 4 [Egan].\n[6] Les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137, (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) pr\u00e9voient, \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 19(1)e), que les parties doivent communiquer une copie des documents qu\u2019elles ont en leur possession relativement \u00e0 un fait, \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 la forme d\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e dans un dossier, y compris ceux relev\u00e9s par les autres parties. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une obligation continue (paragraphes 24(1) et (2) des R\u00e8gles) (White c. Laboratoires Nucl\u00e9aires Canadiens lt\u00e9e, 2023 TCDP 2, au par. 12 [White]).\n[7] Le crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 la divulgation de documents est celui de la pertinence potentielle. Bien que ce crit\u00e8re ne soit pas particuli\u00e8rement strict, la partie qui demande la production d\u2019un document doit tout de m\u00eame d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien rationnel entre ce document et les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte (T.P. c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2019 TCDP 19, au par. 11; Turner c. ASFC, 2018 TCDP 1, au par. 30 [Turner]). La demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre conjecturale ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb, et le Tribunal ne peut admettre en preuve des renseignements confidentiels (Egan, au par. 4, et Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2017 TCDP 33, aux par. 31-32; Turner, au par. 30).\n[8] La divulgation des documents n\u2019entra\u00eene pas automatiquement leur admission en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience (White, au par. 14).\nA. L\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait-elle communiquer les copies non caviard\u00e9es des notes des agents de police et des rapports d\u2019incidents? [9] Selon l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate modifi\u00e9 de la plaignante, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a produit les notes des agents sur les lieux de l\u2019incident et deux documents intitul\u00e9s \u00ab RCMP General Occurrence Report 2015-28031 \u00bb [rapport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019incident de la GRC 2015-28031]. Les documents sont joints en tant que pi\u00e8ces C, D et E \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de Salina Dewar d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la requ\u00eate. Des parties de ces documents sont caviard\u00e9es.\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le d\u00e9caviardage du nom des personnes figurant dans les notes des agents de police constituerait une violation de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, L.R.C. 1985, ch. P-21, et que les renseignements sur les tiers figurant dans les notes d\u2019agents de police et les rapports d\u2019incident de la police sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par une forme de privil\u00e8ge.\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement que, puisqu\u2019elle a admis sa responsabilit\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et que la plaignante a une connaissance directe des personnes qui se sont rendues sur les lieux de l\u2019incident, le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins potentiels n\u2019est pas essentiel pour que la plaignante puisse prouver le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa cause, et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas non plus potentiellement pertinent.\n[12] La plaignante fait valoir que les notes des agents de police et le rapport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019incident contiennent les observations des agents sur les lieux de l\u2019incident et les noms des t\u00e9moins pr\u00e9sents, et que ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments sont pertinents quant \u00e0 la plainte et aux \u00e9ventuelles r\u00e9parations. En outre, la plaignante fait valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi les rapports ou les notes des agents sont confidentiels.\n[13] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne soutient que ces notes et rapports sont pertinents quant aux r\u00e9parations individuelles et syst\u00e9miques, et que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels ne s\u2019applique pas aux obligations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re de communication. Elle soutient en outre que l\u2019all\u00e9gation de privil\u00e8ge formul\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des documents caviard\u00e9s n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e.\n[14] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 l\u2019affidavit de Salina Dewar et ses pi\u00e8ces, la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels et les documents relatifs aux requ\u00eates des parties, je conclus que des copies non caviard\u00e9es des notes des agents de police et du rapport g\u00e9n\u00e9ral d\u2019incident 2015-28031 de la GRC devraient \u00eatre produites.\n[15] \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a admis avoir fait preuve de discrimination, mais la port\u00e9e de cet aveu n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie. Compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9tape o\u00f9 nous en sommes dans l\u2019instance, il semble \u00e9vident que l\u2019identit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins potentiels et les renseignements contenus dans les notes et les rapports des agents de police sont sans doute pertinents quant au fond de la plainte et aux r\u00e9parations potentielles.\n[16] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli que la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels lui interdisait de divulguer des renseignements personnels vraisemblablement pertinents dans le cadre de la production de documents en vertu des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal.\n[17] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 8(2)c) de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\nSous r\u00e9serve d\u2019autres lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, la communication des renseignements personnels qui rel\u00e8vent d\u2019une institution f\u00e9d\u00e9rale est autoris\u00e9e dans les cas suivants : [\u2026]\nc) communication exig\u00e9e par subpoena, mandat ou ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal, d\u2019une personne ou d\u2019un organisme ayant le pouvoir de contraindre \u00e0 la production de renseignements ou exig\u00e9e par des r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure se rapportant \u00e0 la production de renseignements;\n[18] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e peut communiquer des renseignements personnels dans le cadre de ses obligations de production conform\u00e9ment aux R\u00e8gles du Tribunal. Je juge que les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate rendues dans les affaires Windsor-Brown c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2020 TCDP 11, et Hughes c. Transport Canada, 2012 TCDP 26, sont convaincantes \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[19] De plus, les renseignements contenus dans les documents en cause seront prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019engagement implicite, laquelle exige qu\u2019une partie ne communique pas les renseignements obtenus par l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019obligations de communication \u00e0 des fins accessoires au litige (Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations, 2004 TCDP 38, au par. 12).\n[20] \u00c0 ce stade, les documents ne sont pas admis en preuve (White, au par. 14). S\u2019ils le deviennent \u00e0 l\u2019audience conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 38 des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e est pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par les noms des t\u00e9moins, elle peut pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 concernant des personnes pr\u00e9cises \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0.\n[21] L\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la forme de privil\u00e8ge qui pourrait s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 ces documents, et je conclus que son all\u00e9gation en ce sens n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9e.\nB. L\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait-elle communiquer les contrats qu\u2019elle a conclus avec des services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation en langue des signes depuis 2015? [22] La plaignante cherche \u00e0 obtenir les accords ou les contrats conclus par l\u2019intim\u00e9e avec des services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation en langue des signes depuis d\u2019ao\u00fbt 2015 et elle soutient que ces documents sont pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la r\u00e9paration qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame. La plaignante sollicite une ordonnance enjoignant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de prendre des mesures pour \u00e9viter que le m\u00eame type de discrimination dont elle a fait l\u2019objet ne se reproduise \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\n[23] La plaignante r\u00e9clame la divulgation des contrats conclus par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en Colombie\u2011Britannique, o\u00f9 l\u2019incident a eu lieu, et dans l\u2019ensemble du Canada, car elle cherche \u00e0 obtenir des r\u00e9parations syst\u00e9miques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle nationale.\n[24] La plaignante a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa requ\u00eate, une preuve d\u2019expert d\u00e9crivant les mesures que l\u2019intim\u00e9e devrait prendre pour s\u2019assurer que la plaignante et les autres personnes sourdes, devenues sourdes ou malentendantes ne fassent pas l\u2019objet de discrimination (avis de requ\u00eate modifi\u00e9 de la plaignante, au par. 12; rapport d\u2019expert de Mme Debra Russell).\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a soutenu que sa division \u00ab E \u00bb (la province de la Colombie\u2011Britannique) compte 19 employ\u00e9s ayant d\u00e9clar\u00e9 d\u00e9tenir des comp\u00e9tences en langue ASL et que, sur ces 19 employ\u00e9s, 10 sont des traducteurs agr\u00e9\u00e9s en langue ASL. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas de contrats \u00e0 divulguer, mais que, lorsque les employ\u00e9s de la GRC ne sont pas en mesure de fournir une aide \u00e0 la traduction en ASL, les membres peuvent s\u2019adresser \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Language Services Associates (www.LSAWEB.com), un fournisseur tiers. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a expliqu\u00e9 que chaque d\u00e9tachement est responsable de conclure un contrat avec Language Services Associates de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de suivi de l\u2019utilisation de ce service.\n[26] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ne prend pas position sur cet aspect de la demande de communication pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante.\n[27] On peut soutenir qu\u2019un contrat entre un fournisseur de services en langue des signes et le d\u00e9tachement o\u00f9 l\u2019incident a eu lieu en ao\u00fbt 2015 est pertinent pour d\u00e9terminer le montant d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9, s\u2019il en est, au titre de l\u2019article 53 de la Loi, car le rapport d\u2019expert produit par la plaignante mentionne l\u2019existence de tels contrats.\n[28] Le rapport d\u2019expert produit par la plaignante mentionne que les fournisseurs de services en langue des signes doivent \u00eatre accessibles afin que l\u2019intim\u00e9e puisse pr\u00e9venir la discrimination. Par cons\u00e9quent, les contrats actuels entre les d\u00e9tachements de la GRC et les fournisseurs de services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation en langue des signes peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme pertinents quant aux r\u00e9parations syst\u00e9miques.\n[29] Je conclus que l\u2019obligation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire des contrats comprend les contrats que ses d\u00e9tachements ont conclus avec des fournisseurs de services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation des signes, car elle exerce un contr\u00f4le sur ses propres d\u00e9tachements.\nV. Ordonnance [30] Pour les motifs ci-dessus, le Tribunal accueille en partie la requ\u00eate de la plaignante et ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de produire :\nd\u2019ici 14 jours, les notes non caviard\u00e9es d\u2019agents de police et les rapports d\u2019incidents relatifs \u00e0 ses interactions avec la plaignante qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte;\nd\u2019ici 30 jours, tous les contrats ou accords conclus entre elle, y compris ses d\u00e9tachements, et les fournisseurs de services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation en langue des signes en ao\u00fbt 2015, qui couvrent la zone g\u00e9ographique de Langley, en Colombie-Britannique;\nd\u2019ici 30 jours et \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des principes de proportionnalit\u00e9 et d\u2019efficacit\u00e9, tous les contrats ou accords en vigueur \u00e0 la date de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision dans la province de la Colombie-Britannique conclus entre elle, y compris ses d\u00e9tachements, et des fournisseurs de services d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation en langue des signes. La plaignante peut rouvrir cet aspect de la requ\u00eate concernant le reste du Canada \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJennifer A.

Plaintes de Mme Mercier [1] La plaignante, Tracy Mercier, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de son employeur, le Service correctionnel du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb ou le \u00ab SCC \u00bb) dans lesquelles elle all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur le sexe, la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et la d\u00e9ficience. Dans ses plaintes, elle pr\u00e9tend avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination individuelle et syst\u00e9mique de la part du SCC.\n[2] Dans sa premi\u00e8re plainte, Mme Mercier all\u00e8gue que le SCC ne l\u2019a pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9e et a manqu\u00e9 de lui procurer un lieu de travail exempt de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 la suite d\u2019agressions sexuelles qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 commises par un coll\u00e8gue agent correctionnel dans un \u00e9tablissement correctionnel f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la Colombie-Britannique. La premi\u00e8re plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) en juin 2018, dans le cadre d\u2019un groupe de plaintes port\u00e9es par des employ\u00e9es contre le SCC. \u00c0 l\u2019exception de la plainte de Mme Mercier, toutes les plaintes visaient \u00e9galement divers intim\u00e9s, dont plusieurs autres personnes. On a tent\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation pour ce groupe de plaintes, mais Mme Mercier a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus participer au processus. Sa plainte a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en attente par le Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit scind\u00e9e des autres plaintes, \u00e0 sa demande, en juin 2022. Cette scission a fait en sorte que la plainte de Mme Mercier a pu \u00eatre instruite s\u00e9par\u00e9ment.\n[3] Dans sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte, Mme Mercier all\u00e8gue que, \u00e0 son retour au travail, le SCC a refus\u00e9 de mettre en \u0153uvre les mesures d\u2019adaptation recommand\u00e9es par son m\u00e9decin concernant le trouble de stress post-traumatique dont elle souffre. Elle affirme que son trouble de stress post-traumatique a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9 par les faits \u00e0 l\u2019origine de sa premi\u00e8re plainte. Cette plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission le 27 septembre 2022.\n[4] L\u2019intim\u00e9 reconna\u00eet que Mme Mercier a \u00e9t\u00e9 harcel\u00e9e sexuellement par son coll\u00e8gue \u00e0 deux reprises et que ce dernier a fait des commentaires offensants et inappropri\u00e9s sur ses d\u00e9ficiences. Cependant, le SCC ne reconna\u00eet pas avoir fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Mercier quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont il a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 sa plainte de harc\u00e8lement ou aux efforts qu\u2019il a d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s pour qu\u2019elle revienne au travail.\n[5] Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire dans cette affaire qui s\u2019est tenue le 15 novembre 2022, Mme Mercier a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte avait r\u00e9cemment \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal et qu\u2019elle souhaitait joindre les deux plaintes afin qu\u2019elles puissent \u00eatre instruites conjointement. Les parties ont convenu de s\u2019entretenir apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire pour d\u00e9terminer si elles consentaient \u00e0 joindre les plaintes et pour conna\u00eetre en quoi cette instruction conjointe influerait sur le processus de gestion de l\u2019instance. Le 24 novembre 2022, les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jointes par une ordonnance du Tribunal, avec le consentement de toutes les parties. Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions pour inclure la deuxi\u00e8me plainte.\nII. Conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022 [6] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022, plusieurs autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments li\u00e9s \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9s, notamment : les exigences li\u00e9es \u00e0 la divulgation de documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9; la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019adopter une approche tenant compte des traumatismes dans le cadre de la plainte; et la planification des dates d\u2019audience.\n[7] En ce qui concerne la divulgation des documents, je fais remarquer que la discussion tenue lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire n\u2019a port\u00e9 que sur la premi\u00e8re plainte de Mme Mercier, car cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 sa deuxi\u00e8me plainte qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de la r\u00e9union. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il pr\u00e9voyait fournir les documents du dossier personnel de Mme Mercier (concernant l\u2019aspect individuel de sa plainte) d\u2019ici le 5 d\u00e9cembre 2022. La Commission avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir des documents concernant les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de dire quand exactement ces documents seraient divulgu\u00e9s aux autres parties; il a toutefois expliqu\u00e9 le processus assez lourd qu\u2019il doit suivre pour produire des documents dans le cadre d\u2019un litige.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il lui faudrait au moins quatre \u00e0 cinq mois pour produire les nombreux documents requis par la Commission. La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir tous ses documents avant la fin de d\u00e9cembre 2022. Elle a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rendre ce d\u00e9lai imp\u00e9ratif, de sorte que le non-respect du d\u00e9lai par le SCC pourrait entra\u00eener des cons\u00e9quences, y compris le risque que le Tribunal tire des conclusions d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 son \u00e9gard lors de l\u2019audience.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a affirm\u00e9 que la proposition de la Commission n\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9aliste et qu\u2019une demande visant \u00e0 rendre le d\u00e9lai imp\u00e9ratif devrait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une requ\u00eate plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00eatre tranch\u00e9e lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire. L\u2019avocate de la Commission s\u2019est fermement oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e de proc\u00e9der par voie de requ\u00eate, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait entendu que l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente plainte devait se faire de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive.\n[10] Le Tribunal et les parties se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 instruire la plainte de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive apr\u00e8s que la Commission leur a demand\u00e9, en juillet 2022, de respecter tous les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s sans demander de prorogation ni pr\u00e9senter de requ\u00eates inutiles, et de raccourcir les d\u00e9lais pour toutes les \u00e9tapes du litige, y compris l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai convenu que la Commission avait demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de formuler une directive pour veiller \u00e0 ce que toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires soient prises le plus t\u00f4t possible dans le processus de gestion de l\u2019instance afin de r\u00e9duire les d\u00e9lais. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement convenu que la pr\u00e9sente plainte devait \u00eatre instruite de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, compte tenu du temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la m\u00e9diation.\n[11] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre, la Commission a \u00e9galement r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019importance d\u2019adopter une approche tenant compte des traumatismes dans la gestion de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, car Mme Mercier est une personne autochtone qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une agression sexuelle sur son lieu de travail. La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte a nui \u00e0 la sant\u00e9 mentale et physique de Mme Mercier et \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 retourner au travail.\n[12] Mme Mercier a expliqu\u00e9 comment le processus de plainte l\u2019avait affect\u00e9e. Elle a convenu qu\u2019elle aurait la certitude que le processus de plainte progresse si des dates d\u2019audience \u00e9taient fix\u00e9es. La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en voie de nommer un expert en mati\u00e8re de pratiques tenant compte des traumatismes et qu\u2019elle collaborerait ensuite avec les parties pour obtenir leur consentement pour la mise en place d\u2019un plan permettant d\u2019appliquer une approche sensible aux traumatismes. Les parties et le Tribunal ont convenu de suivre pareille approche et ont accept\u00e9 la proposition de la Commission.\n[13] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 des directives aux parties pour que la plainte soit trait\u00e9e de la fa\u00e7on la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible. Ces directives \u00e9taient informelles et n\u2019ont pas pris la forme d\u2019une ordonnance, ce qui a permis aux parties de collaborer, dans la mesure du possible, pour \u00e9tablir un processus et un calendrier destin\u00e9 \u00e0 faire progresser la plainte. Mme Mercier a accept\u00e9 la proposition de la Commission de fixer les dates d\u2019audience \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2023. Apr\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, les parties devaient indiquer leurs disponibilit\u00e9s pour cette p\u00e9riode afin de fixer les dates pour les deux ou trois premi\u00e8res semaines de l\u2019audience. Une fois la date de d\u00e9but d\u2019audience fix\u00e9e, la Commission devait proposer un d\u00e9lai pour la divulgation des documents de l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique. J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que si les parties ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 s\u2019accorder sur les d\u00e9lais, je pourrais \u00eatre appel\u00e9e \u00e0 les fixer moi-m\u00eame.\nIII. Requ\u00eate de la Commission [14] Le 18 novembre 2022, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate plut\u00f4t que de suivre les directives du Tribunal. Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission demande au Tribunal de rendre plusieurs ordonnances relatives aux questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire. Cette initiative \u00e9tait surprenante puisque la Commission consid\u00e9rait que les parties devraient s\u2019abstenir de d\u00e9poser des requ\u00eates sauf en cas de n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 absolue.\n[15] Dans sa requ\u00eate du 18 novembre 2022, la Commission sollicite l\u2019ordonnance suivante :\nque la plainte soit instruite et que toutes les d\u00e9cisions connexes soient rendues selon une d\u00e9marche qui tient compte de la culture et des traumatismes; que le calendrier propos\u00e9 par la Commission pour les \u00e9tapes du litige, dont l\u2019audience fait partie, et qui l\u2019incluent, soit accept\u00e9; que les d\u00e9lais du SCC deviennent imp\u00e9ratifs; que la personne qui a agress\u00e9 sexuellement Mme Mercier sur son lieu de travail ne soit pas avis\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal; q que les deux plaintes de Mme Mercier soient jointes.\nIV. Analyse [16] Les cinq questions soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022; les parties se sont entendues sur certaines d\u2019entre elles et le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 des directives pour les autres. La mani\u00e8re dont ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es dans le cadre du processus de gestion de l\u2019instance \u00e9tait conforme \u00e0 l\u2019entente conclue entre les parties et le Tribunal en vue de l\u2019instruction exp\u00e9ditive. Elle \u00e9tait \u00e9galement conforme \u00e0 l\u2019exigence pr\u00e9vue par la loi selon laquelle le Tribunal doit instruire les plaintes \u00ab sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb (paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C., 1985, c. H-6 [la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb]).\n[17] Les requ\u00eates ne doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9es que lorsqu\u2019une question de proc\u00e9dure ou de fond ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9solue entre les parties ou lorsqu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire que le Tribunal rende une ordonnance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question litigieuse. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure informelle et une marche \u00e0 suivre a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de cette requ\u00eate n\u2019\u00e9tait donc pas n\u00e9cessaire et a entra\u00een\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais suppl\u00e9mentaires inutiles.\n[18] J\u2019ai donn\u00e9 une directive distincte contenant les d\u00e9lais relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, y compris la date du d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience et les d\u00e9lais pour la divulgation et la pr\u00e9paration des rapports d\u2019experts. J\u2019examinerai plus loin chacune des questions soulev\u00e9es par la Commission dans sa requ\u00eate, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la question de la jonction des deux plaintes de Mme Mercier. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal a rapidement r\u00e9gl\u00e9 cette derni\u00e8re question \u00e0 la suite de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022 en rendant une ordonnance.\nA. Instruction tenant compte de la culture et des traumatismes [19] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission demande au Tribunal de ne pas attendre qu\u2019elle nomme un expert pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la plainte soit instruite selon une approche qui tient compte de la culture et des traumatismes. Elle propose diverses mesures pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience et des mesures de protection que le Tribunal peut imm\u00e9diatement mettre en place pour \u00e9viter que Mme Mercier ne subisse de nouveaux pr\u00e9judices. Elle affirme que ces mesures sont propos\u00e9es dans le but de cr\u00e9er des processus qui reconnaissent les exp\u00e9riences des peuples autochtones et qui s\u2019en inspirent.\n[20] Les mesures propos\u00e9es sont les suivantes : demander l\u2019avis de Mme Mercier \u00e0 tous les stades, y compris en ce qui concerne les c\u00e9r\u00e9monies sp\u00e9ciales ou l\u2019orientation culturelle; veiller \u00e0 ce que des mesures d\u2019adaptation lui soient offertes; fournir un environnement pr\u00e9visible, fiable et transparent afin que Mme Mercier sache ce \u00e0 quoi s\u2019attendre dans le cadre du processus et qu\u2019elle soit assur\u00e9e du respect des d\u00e9lais; veiller \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il y ait des cons\u00e9quences si les d\u00e9lais ne sont pas respect\u00e9s; veiller \u00e0 ce que Mme Mercier puisse, sans crainte, dire au cours du processus si elle se sent victime d\u2019un traumatisme; chercher \u00e0 simplifier et \u00e0 acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer l\u2019instruction autant que possible; et interagir avec civisme, int\u00e9grit\u00e9 et humilit\u00e9.\n[21] Dans ses observations, Mme Mercier fait remarquer qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de soutien en lien avec la sensibilit\u00e9 culturelle ou les traumatismes dans le cadre de l\u2019instance, mais qu\u2019elle souscrit \u00e0 la proposition de la Commission.\n[22] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019il a accept\u00e9 que la proc\u00e9dure tienne compte des traumatismes d\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re fois o\u00f9 la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e, et qu\u2019il souscrit aux recommandations de la Commission. Il ne pense pas que les parties et le Tribunal aient besoin de l\u2019assistance d\u2019un expert.\n[23] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la Commission affirme qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate [traduction] \u00ab pour faire part de ses pr\u00e9occupations et pour s\u2019assurer que la pr\u00e9sente instance se d\u00e9roule de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et \u00e9quitable et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui tienne compte de la culture et des traumatismes. La Commission est d\u2019avis que cet objectif ne peut \u00eatre atteint de mani\u00e8re informelle sans l\u2019intervention du Tribunal, compte tenu de la lenteur de la proc\u00e9dure et des d\u00e9lais non respect\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[24] La Commission indique \u00e9galement qu\u2019\u00e0 sa connaissance, c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois que le Tribunal met en place des mesures similaires pour une partie autochtone qui agit pour son propre compte apr\u00e8s avoir surv\u00e9cu \u00e0 une agression sexuelle et qui s\u2019identifie comme \u00e9tant une personne ayant subi un traumatisme. Les directives du Tribunal, \u00e9tablies avec l\u2019aide d\u2019un expert, contribueront \u00e0 assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et dans les affaires ult\u00e9rieures.\n[25] Je fais remarquer que les requ\u00eates n\u2019ont pas pour but de permettre aux parties de consigner leurs pr\u00e9occupations au dossier. Les parties peuvent le faire au cours des conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires et en communiquant avec le Tribunal, ainsi que dans leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. Tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments font partie du dossier officiel du Tribunal. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la Commission a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il restait des d\u00e9tails \u00e0 r\u00e9gler \u00e0 la suite de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, elle aurait pu les traiter de mani\u00e8re moins formelle, par exemple en envoyant un courriel ou une lettre afin d\u2019obtenir des instructions ou des \u00e9claircissements.\n[26] Le Tribunal veille r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement \u00e0 ce que les parties qui comparaissent devant lui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de mesures d\u2019adaptation. Plut\u00f4t que de s\u2019appuyer sur un \u00ab pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent \u00bb d\u00e9crivant le traitement \u00e0 adopter \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un participant donn\u00e9, le Tribunal agit conform\u00e9ment aux principes des droits de la personne en traitant tout participant \u00e0 une instance comme ayant des besoins uniques. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 le Tribunal veille \u00e0 ce que tous les participants qui comparaissent devant lui soient trait\u00e9s avec \u00e9quit\u00e9, il peut modifier la proc\u00e9dure, si n\u00e9cessaire, pour que toute personne ayant subi un traumatisme se sente en s\u00e9curit\u00e9, respect\u00e9e et \u00e0 l\u2019aise pendant l\u2019instruction. Cette latitude vise notamment le processus de gestion de l\u2019instance. Les participants ne devraient pas h\u00e9siter \u00e0 indiquer les mesures d\u2019adaptation qu\u2019elles souhaiteraient que le Tribunal prenne, au besoin. Parall\u00e8lement, les parties doivent s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elles disposent de toutes les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour les aider \u00e0 mesure que progressent leurs plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne tout au long du processus d\u2019audience.\n[27] Comme le Tribunal doit veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte soit culturellement adapt\u00e9e, il est r\u00e9ceptif aux demandes visant \u00e0 faire en sorte que les parties, dont bon nombre d\u2019entre elles sont des Autochtones, se sentent entendues et respect\u00e9es au cours de l\u2019instance. Le Tribunal prend les mesures d\u2019adaptation n\u00e9cessaires pour r\u00e9pondre aux demandes des parties autochtones relatives \u00e0 la tenue de c\u00e9r\u00e9monies ou encore en vue de s\u2019assurer que l\u2019instance se d\u00e9roule d\u2019une mani\u00e8re culturellement respectueuse et appropri\u00e9e. Mme Mercier devrait se sentir \u00e0 l\u2019aise d\u2019indiquer au Tribunal comment il peut s\u2019assurer que la proc\u00e9dure, y compris l\u2019audience, respecte sa culture autochtone.\n[28] Toutes les parties et le Tribunal ont accept\u00e9 d\u2019adopter une approche qui tient compte des traumatismes. Le Tribunal a lu et entendu les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Mercier et continuera \u00e0 le faire. Mme Mercier fait un travail admirable en tant que plaignante qui agit pour son propre compte; elle respecte les d\u00e9lais et veille \u00e0 ce que ses positions soient clairement communiqu\u00e9es au Tribunal et aux parties. Je n\u2019ai aucune raison de douter qu\u2019elle continuera de communiquer ses besoins.\n[29] Le Tribunal adh\u00e8re aux recommandations de la Commission et est d\u2019avis que la plupart d\u2019entre elles seraient suivies dans le cadre d\u2019une instance normale, plus particuli\u00e8rement lorsqu\u2019une partie agit pour son compte. Le Tribunal veillera \u00e0 ce que les recommandations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate de la Commission soient mises en \u0153uvre, au besoin, au cours du processus de gestion de l\u2019instance.\n[30] Comme le Tribunal et les parties se sont engag\u00e9s \u00e0 proc\u00e9der d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui tienne compte des traumatismes, les avocats doivent \u00eatre conscients de leur propre comportement et t\u00e2cher d\u2019\u00e9viter que les r\u00e9unions de gestion de l\u2019instance ne soient plus conflictuelles que n\u00e9cessaire, car nous collaborons tous pendant ces r\u00e9unions afin que l\u2019instruction se fasse de la fa\u00e7on la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible.\n[31] Il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus rapide, plus respectueux de l\u2019utilisation du temps et des ressources du Tribunal et des parties et globalement plus conforme \u00e0 une d\u00e9marche sensible aux traumatismes de suivre un processus moins formel que de recourir \u00e0 un moyen contentieux tel qu\u2019une requ\u00eate.\nB. Calendrier propos\u00e9 par la Commission [32] La Commission propose un calendrier pour que certaines \u00e9tapes se d\u00e9roulent avant l\u2019audience, lequel comprend notamment des d\u00e9lais pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages anticip\u00e9s des experts de la Commission, pour la divulgation par le SCC et pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de rapports d\u2019experts ainsi que des dates d\u2019audience sur une p\u00e9riode de six semaines.\n[33] La Commission affirme que le Tribunal devrait accepter ce calendrier conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente sur l\u2019instruction exp\u00e9ditive. Elle affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 un processus tenant compte des traumatismes de faire tra\u00eener les \u00e9tapes pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience plus longtemps.\n[34] Mme Mercier est du m\u00eame avis que la Commission. Elle a joint une \u00ab d\u00e9claration de la victime \u00bb \u00e0 ses observations pour expliquer comment elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e par ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu pendant qu\u2019elle travaillait au SCC et apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des plaintes, y compris tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[35] Le SCC affirme qu\u2019en ce qui concerne les d\u00e9lais, il est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement guid\u00e9 par la volont\u00e9 de Mme Mercier, qui a express\u00e9ment fait savoir qu\u2019elle souhaitait que la date d\u2019audience soit fix\u00e9e d\u00e8s que possible. Il dit avoir accept\u00e9 que l\u2019audience d\u00e9bute en septembre 2023, suivant les dates propos\u00e9es par la Commission. Le SCC affirme que pour que les parties soient pr\u00eates pour l\u2019audience \u00e0 ce moment, et que cette derni\u00e8re soit cibl\u00e9e, les parties devraient envisager de simplifier la proc\u00e9dure en fonction des besoins de Mme Mercier. Le SCC propose de poursuivre la discussion avec Mme Mercier et la Commission sur la simplification du processus d\u2019audience, soit dans le cadre d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, soit dans le cadre d\u2019un autre processus. Il affirme qu\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019un plan tenant compte du point de vue de Mme Mercier, il lui serait plus facile de savoir quels documents doivent \u00eatre produits et il pourrait commencer \u00e0 les d\u00e9poser. La Commission rejette la proposition du SCC de simplifier le processus d\u2019audience et la qualifie [traduction] \u00ab attaque incidente irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re \u00bb sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[36] Le SCC soutient que toutes les parties t\u00e2chent de faire progresser la pr\u00e9sente affaire en vue de son instruction ou de son r\u00e8glement et que les affirmations qui polarisent davantage les parties nuisent \u00e0 ce processus. Il propose un processus de production de documents en continu, qui comprendrait une nouvelle liste toutes les six semaines jusqu\u2019\u00e0 six semaines avant l\u2019audience. Il soutient que ce processus permettra aux parties de recevoir leurs documents en continu jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la production soit compl\u00e8te, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en une seule fois. Le SCC affirme que les parties auront ainsi plus de temps pour examiner ses documents et que s\u2019il est en mesure de produire ceux-ci plus t\u00f4t, il ne manquera pas de le faire. Le SCC propose \u00e9galement son propre calendrier pour les rapports d\u2019experts et les cahiers de documents.\n[37] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la Commission affirme qu\u2019une partie ne peut refuser de communiquer des documents et d\u00e9cider de les produire selon son bon vouloir; or, c\u2019est justement ce que le SCC propose avec la divulgation en continu. La Commission fait remarquer que le SCC, comme toutes les parties, a l\u2019obligation permanente de produire les documents et pi\u00e8ces pertinents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9s ou qui sont entr\u00e9s en sa possession apr\u00e8s la divulgation initiale. Elle soutient que l\u2019autorisation de la divulgation en continu cr\u00e9erait un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent probl\u00e9matique qui engendrerait des d\u00e9lais et favoriserait l\u2019in\u00e9galit\u00e9 entre les parties. Elle affirme que la divulgation en continu porterait \u00e9galement atteinte au caract\u00e8re \u00e9quitable de la proc\u00e9dure, car les autres parties risqueraient de ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de pr\u00e9parer leur th\u00e8se ou de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 celle de la partie adverse ad\u00e9quatement.\n[38] La Commission soutient que le Tribunal devrait tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que le SCC ne s\u2019est pas pench\u00e9 sur les dix points qu\u2019elle a \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans sa demande voulant que le calendrier qu\u2019elle avait propos\u00e9 soit suivi. Elle soutient \u00e9galement que le Tribunal devrait tirer une inf\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable du refus du SCC de [traduction] \u00ab rem\u00e9dier au pr\u00e9judice important \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par Mme Mercier, r\u00e9sultant du report continu de l\u2019instruction et du manque de mesures ou de cons\u00e9quences pour g\u00e9rer ce pr\u00e9judice \u00bb. Elle affirme que le Tribunal doit rem\u00e9dier au pr\u00e9judice et mettre en place des mesures pour faire en sorte que toutes les parties soient sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9.\n[39] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de me faire part de leurs disponibilit\u00e9s pour fixer le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2023, apr\u00e8s quoi j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de proposer un d\u00e9lai pour la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en partant \u00e0 rebours \u00e0 partir de la date d\u2019audience. Si la Commission avait fait pareille proposition, et que celle-ci avait suscit\u00e9 un d\u00e9saccord, la question aurait pu \u00eatre trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re moins formelle, et j\u2019aurais donn\u00e9 des directives ou rendu une ordonnance concernant le d\u00e9lai de divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9. La Commission a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\n[40] Je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention de tirer d\u2019inf\u00e9rences d\u00e9favorables du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 les dix points \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Commission dans sa requ\u00eate. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a choisi de pr\u00e9senter des observations concises et de se concentrer sur la date \u00e0 laquelle il divulguera ses documents, ce qui est conforme \u00e0 l\u2019objectif d\u2019une instruction exp\u00e9ditive. Si la Commission et Mme Mercier souhaitent faire valoir que le Tribunal devrait tirer des inf\u00e9rences d\u00e9favorables concernant la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9, elles peuvent le faire dans leurs observations apr\u00e8s l\u2019audition de la preuve.\n[41] Cependant, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la divulgation en continu jusqu\u2019\u00e0 six semaines avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience est acceptable. Pareil processus ne serait pas \u00e9quitable pour la Commission ou pour Mme Mercier, qui ont droit \u00e0 une divulgation en temps opportun afin de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La Commission a l\u2019intention de convoquer trois experts, qui doivent examiner la divulgation relative aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique avant de pr\u00e9parer leurs rapports.\n[42] La Commission ne semble pas partager le point de vue de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel l\u2019audience peut \u00eatre simplifi\u00e9e ou circonscrite gr\u00e2ce aux discussions entre les parties, en d\u00e9pit du fait qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9 cette recommandation pour que la proc\u00e9dure tienne compte des traumatismes afin [traduction] \u00ab de simplifier et d\u2019instruire la plainte de fa\u00e7on aussi exp\u00e9ditive que possible et d\u2019encourager les parties \u00e0 circonscrire les questions en litige \u00e0 l\u2019aide d\u2019une entente \u00bb. En tout \u00e9tat de cause, ces circonstances ne devraient pas retarder la divulgation des documents par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[43] J\u2019ai \u00e9tabli un calendrier, qui comprend les dates d\u2019ouverture de l\u2019audience et les d\u00e9lais pour la divulgation et la production des rapports d\u2019experts, dans une lettre de directives \u00e0 l\u2019intention des parties qui sera envoy\u00e9e apr\u00e8s le prononc\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\nC. Demande visant \u00e0 rendre les d\u00e9lais imp\u00e9ratifs [44] C\u2019est la troisi\u00e8me fois que la Commission demande au Tribunal de rendre les d\u00e9lais du SCC imp\u00e9ratifs. La Commission a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa premi\u00e8re demande en juillet 2022, dans laquelle elle demandait \u00e9galement que l\u2019instruction soit men\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9 par toutes les parties et le Tribunal. J\u2019ai estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de rendre les d\u00e9lais de l\u2019intim\u00e9 imp\u00e9ratifs \u00e0 ce moment puisque la Commission demandait \u00e0 toutes les parties de s\u2019engager \u00e0 respecter leurs \u00e9ch\u00e9ances et \u00e0 ne pas demander de nouvelles prolongations de d\u00e9lais. J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que si la longueur des d\u00e9lais semblait porter atteinte \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance et au processus d\u2019instruction, les parties pourraient en faire part au Tribunal et d\u2019autres mesures pourraient \u00eatre prises au besoin.\n[45] La Commission a renouvel\u00e9 sa demande de d\u00e9lais imp\u00e9ratifs lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022. Comme je l\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, j\u2019ai plut\u00f4t demand\u00e9 aux parties de collaborer pour \u00e9tablir des d\u00e9lais en partant \u00e0 rebours \u00e0 partir des dates d\u2019audience, qui seraient fix\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2023.\n[46] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission demande que les d\u00e9lais de l\u2019intim\u00e9 deviennent imp\u00e9ratifs parce qu\u2019elle est [traduction] \u00ab profond\u00e9ment pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le temps que prend le SCC en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00bb. Dans ses observations, elle a aussi \u00e9tabli la chronologie des mesures prises depuis le renvoi de la plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[47] Selon la Commission, le non-respect des d\u00e9lais imp\u00e9ratifs pourrait notamment entra\u00eener les cons\u00e9quences suivantes : l\u2019interdiction de d\u00e9poser des documents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent; la formulation de conclusions d\u00e9favorables par le Tribunal; la condamnation du SCC aux d\u00e9pens; toute autre mesure que le Tribunal peut ordonner en vertu des articles 9 ou 10 des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, 2021, DORS\/2021-137 [les \u00ab R\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb].\n[48] La plaignante est du m\u00eame avis que la Commission sur cette question.\n[49] L\u2019intim\u00e9 dit qu\u2019il comprend les pr\u00e9occupations de la Commission quant \u00e0 la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 que la pr\u00e9sente affaire soit r\u00e9gl\u00e9e ou instruite dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais et qu\u2019il fera tout ce qui est en son pouvoir pour respecter ses \u00e9ch\u00e9ances. Il affirme qu\u2019il ne prend pas la question du respect de ses d\u00e9lais \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re et est conscient du fait que le Tribunal a le devoir d\u2019instruire la plainte de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive.\n[50] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019article 9 des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal rend effectivement obligatoires les d\u00e9lais impos\u00e9s par le Tribunal, sous peine d\u2019une ordonnance corrective ou d\u2019autres cons\u00e9quences, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019ordonner que ses d\u00e9lais soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme imp\u00e9ratifs.\n[51] Je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 que l\u2019article 9 rend effectivement obligatoires les d\u00e9lais impos\u00e9s par le Tribunal. Rien dans l\u2019\u00e9volution chronologique de l\u2019instruction pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission ne montre que, depuis ma d\u00e9cision de juillet 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement omis de respecter les d\u00e9lais impos\u00e9s par le Tribunal ou qu\u2019il se serait comport\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re telle qu\u2019une ordonnance visant \u00e0 rendre les d\u00e9lais imp\u00e9ratifs s\u2019impose. Toutefois, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne respecte pas les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s pour sa divulgation, le Tribunal s\u2019interrogera sur la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der et sur les cons\u00e9quences qui pourraient \u00eatre appropri\u00e9es le moment venu.\nD. Avis \u00e0 l\u2019agresseur [52] Pendant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si, par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, la personne qui a harcel\u00e9 sexuellement Mme Mercier devrait \u00eatre inform\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente instruction. L\u2019intim\u00e9 voulait savoir si le Tribunal ou la Commission avait mis en place un processus pour g\u00e9rer de telles situations. Mme Mercier a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle s\u2019y opposait, car la simple mention du nom de cette personne la bouleverse. Les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9es \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 cette question; elle pourrait, au besoin, faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une discussion lors de la prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire.\n[53] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la Commission affirme que ni le Tribunal ni elle-m\u00eame n\u2019a l\u2019obligation d\u2019informer l\u2019agresseur de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, et elle demande au Tribunal de rendre sa d\u00e9cision en adoptant une d\u00e9marche qui tient compte des traumatismes.\n[54] Dans ses observations sur la requ\u00eate de la Commission, Mme Mercier affirme que l\u2019intim\u00e9 tente de l\u2019intimider en utilisant le nom de l\u2019agresseur dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et en soulevant la question concernant la possibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019informer durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire.\n[55] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas propos\u00e9, durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, d\u2019informer l\u2019agresseur. Il a plut\u00f4t simplement demand\u00e9 si la Commission ou le Tribunal disposait d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure pour aviser l\u2019agresseur ou d\u2019autres personnes dans sa situation. Il affirme qu\u2019il est convaincu d\u2019avoir soulev\u00e9 la question du point de vue de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et il ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019informera pas l\u2019agresseur.\n[56] La requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un moyen appropri\u00e9 pour formuler sa demande. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas de d\u00e9cision \u00e0 rendre.\n[57] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se selon laquelle l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 cette question dans le cadre d\u2019une tactique d\u2019intimidation, comme l\u2019all\u00e8gue Mme Mercier. Elle a simplement pos\u00e9 une question sur l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Le fait que l\u2019instruction suive une d\u00e9marche tenant compte des traumatismes n\u2019emp\u00eache pas l\u2019intim\u00e9 de poser des questions et ne permet pas au Tribunal d\u2019agir in\u00e9quitablement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre partie. Toutefois, tous peuvent collaborer pour veiller \u00e0 ce que les questions soient soulev\u00e9es avec tact.\n[58] Je fais remarquer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 continue d\u2019inclure le nom de l\u2019agresseur dans sa correspondance avec le Tribunal et les parties. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Mercier a exprim\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point elle se sentait boulevers\u00e9e \u00e0 la simple mention de ce nom, j\u2019exhorte l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 cesser de l\u2019inclure dans sa correspondance avec les parties, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de le faire et que cela est susceptible de causer davantage de stress et d\u2019inconfort \u00e0 Mme Mercier. Je souligne toutefois que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir Mme Mercier lorsque le nom de l\u2019agresseur figure dans les documents qu\u2019il lui communique, ce qui est utile.\n[59] Le Tribunal examinera certainement des propositions visant \u00e0 faire en sorte que la pr\u00e9sente affaire se d\u00e9roule de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que Mme Mercier ne soit pas \u00e9branl\u00e9e en raison de l\u2019utilisation du nom de cette personne. Cette question pourra \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9e lors de la prochaine r\u00e9union de gestion de l\u2019instance ou par \u00e9crit. C\u2019est en tout cas ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022.\nV. Conclusion [60] La Commission affirme dans ses observations que le fait de veiller \u00e0 ce que le processus soit pr\u00e9visible et \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il se d\u00e9roule dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais est une fa\u00e7on d\u2019adopter une d\u00e9marche qui est sensible aux traumatismes. Je suis du m\u00eame avis. Un processus qui est pr\u00e9visible et qui se d\u00e9roule dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais peut \u00eatre \u00e9labor\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re informelle au cours d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire ou gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une directive du Tribunal. Il ne doit pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u00e9couler d\u2019une requ\u00eate. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate a eu pour effet de prolonger la proc\u00e9dure.\n[61] Bien que la Commission ait affirm\u00e9 que le Tribunal pourrait se prononcer sur cette requ\u00eate lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, je fais remarquer que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 des directives concernant les questions soulev\u00e9es dans ladite requ\u00eate lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 novembre 2022. Pourtant, la Commission est tout de m\u00eame all\u00e9e de l\u2019avant avec le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa requ\u00eate. La Commission a \u00e9galement fait valoir que le Tribunal doit se prononcer sur cette requ\u00eate dans un d\u00e9lai beaucoup plus court que celui pr\u00e9vu par les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal, car il s\u2019agit d\u2019une instruction exp\u00e9ditive.\n[62] Une instruction exp\u00e9ditive ne signifie pas que le Tribunal doive toujours donner la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire en question, au d\u00e9triment de ses autres dossiers. Ce serait injuste pour les autres parties qui attendent des jugements, des d\u00e9cisions ou des directives. Le Tribunal ne dispose pas d\u2019un temps infini et de ressources illimit\u00e9es. Toutes les plaintes dont il est saisi sont importantes et il a l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale de les trancher rapidement.\n[63] Dans la d\u00e9cision Letnes c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2022 TCDP 32, le Tribunal a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019importance de proc\u00e9der promptement et efficacement, tout en reconnaissant la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9server ses ressources limit\u00e9es en ne \u00ab tran[chant pas] toutes les questions qui sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une plainte \u00bb :\n[20] Dans un arr\u00eat r\u00e9cent, Law Society of Saskatchewan c. Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada souligne au paragraphe 46 de ses motifs qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire que les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs rendent leurs d\u00e9cisions promptement et efficacement. Elle ajoute que l\u2019existence de d\u00e9lais excessifs dans les proc\u00e9dures administratives va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des int\u00e9r\u00eats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et compromet la r\u00e9alisation d\u2019un objectif fondamental de la d\u00e9l\u00e9gation de pouvoirs d\u00e9cisionnels \u00e0 ces organismes \u2014 un processus d\u00e9cisionnel rapide et efficient.\n[21] Dans la d\u00e9cision Chen v. Workplace Safety and Insurance Appeals Tribunal, 2020 ONSC 6287, au paragraphe 12, la Cour divisionnaire de l\u2019Ontario mentionne les retards in\u00e9vitables d\u00e9coulant de la pr\u00e9sentation de requ\u00eates de nature proc\u00e9durale suppl\u00e9mentaires et de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 des avocats \u00e0 s\u2019entendre pour r\u00e9gler certains probl\u00e8mes.\n[22] Le pr\u00e9sent Tribunal ajoute que l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la [LCDP]. Les [R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal] font \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux principes applicables aux plaintes, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre tranch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable, informelle et rapide.\n[23] Le Tribunal ne dispose pas de ressources illimit\u00e9es pour trancher toutes les questions qui sont susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre soulev\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019une plainte. Les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale pr\u00e9vaudront toujours, mais le Tribunal doit tenir compte du principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 et de ses ressources limit\u00e9es.\n[64] Les parties doivent \u00eatre conscientes que le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de requ\u00eates non n\u00e9cessaires pour des questions qui pourraient \u00eatre r\u00e9solues de mani\u00e8re moins formelle dans le cadre du processus de gestion de l\u2019instance peut entra\u00eener des retards non seulement dans l\u2019affaire en cours, mais aussi dans d\u2019autres dossiers dont le Tribunal est saisi. Le fait de s\u2019engager dans un processus plus contentieux, comme le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une requ\u00eate, n\u2019est pas conforme \u00e0 une approche tenant compte des traumatismes et devrait \u00eatre \u00e9vit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, \u00e0 moins que cela ne soit absolument n\u00e9cessaire.\nSign\u00e9e par\nColleen Harrington\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa, Ontario\nLe 20 mars 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossiers du Tribunal :\nT2311\/6618, HR-DP-2878-22\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nMercier c.

APER\u00c7U\n[1] Frank Kim (le plaignant) est un d\u00e9linquant d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de La Macaza exploit\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Service correctionnel du Canada (le \u00ab SCC \u00bb ou l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb). Dans sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, il all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles contre lui parce qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 deux autres plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb), lesquelles ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un r\u00e8glement. Il soutient qu\u2019une psychologue travaillant pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9, lors de son audience de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle, un rapport dans lequel elle tirait des conclusions d\u00e9favorables du fait qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, ce qui a relev\u00e9 son niveau de risque \/ \u00e9valuation du risque. La Commission des lib\u00e9rations conditionnelles du Canada (la \u00ab CLCC \u00bb) a rejet\u00e9 sa demande de lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle.\n[2] Les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, mais le plaignant soutient que la divulgation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est incompl\u00e8te. Il demande qu\u2019il soit ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter six s\u00e9ries de documents.\nII. D\u00c9CISION\n[3] Les demandes sont accord\u00e9es en partie.\nIII. CRIT\u00c8RES DE DIVULGATION\n[4] Dans l\u2019affaire Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2017 TCDP 28 (CanLII), aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 10, le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb ou le \u00ab TCDP \u00bb) a \u00e9tabli les crit\u00e8res s\u2019appliquant \u00e0 la divulgation. Selon le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 [LCDP], les parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant le Tribunal doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs arguments. Cela exige, entre autres choses, que les parties adverses divulguent les renseignements potentiellement pertinents qui sont en leur possession ou sous leurs soins avant l\u2019audience sur la question. Outre les faits et les questions en litige pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les parties, la divulgation de renseignements permet \u00e0 chaque partie de savoir ce qui lui est reproch\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[5] Pour d\u00e9cider de la divulgation des renseignements, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer la pertinence des renseignements en cause. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une norme particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9e. S\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties en cause, les renseignements devraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s.\n[6] Toutefois, la demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une \u00ab partie de p\u00eache \u00bb. Les documents demand\u00e9s devraient \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de fa\u00e7on suffisamment pr\u00e9cise. Le Tribunal peut refuser d\u2019ordonner la divulgation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lorsque la valeur probante de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments ne l\u2019emporte pas sur leur effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur la proc\u00e9dure. Le Tribunal doit faire preuve de prudence avant d\u2019ordonner une recherche de documents qui serait on\u00e9reuse et vaste pour une partie, surtout si cette ordonnance risque d\u2019entra\u00eener un retard important dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte ou si les documents ne se rapportent qu\u2019\u00e0 une question secondaire plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux questions principales en litige.\n[7] La divulgation de renseignements potentiellement pertinents ne veut pas dire que ces renseignements seront admis en preuve lors de l\u2019audience ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative au cours du processus d\u00e9cisionnel. De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de divulgation d\u2019une partie se limite aux documents \u00ab qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u00bb, le Tribunal ne peut ordonner \u00e0 une partie de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ou de cr\u00e9er de nouveaux documents pour les fins de la divulgation.\nIV. \u00c9L\u00c9MENTS DEMAND\u00c9S\n[8] Compte tenu de ces principes, je traite chaque demande de divulgation ci-dessous.\n(i) Les dossiers de gestion de cas du SCC concernant le plaignant, entre le 7 novembre 2014 et le dossier actuel, non expurg\u00e9s de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment li\u00e9 aux plaintes que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission ou \u00e0 son recours \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de la Commission\n[9] Malgr\u00e9 la mention de la Commission dans la demande, l\u2019intim\u00e9 semble la consid\u00e9rer comme une demande visant tous ses dossiers de gestion de cas li\u00e9s au plaignant, ce qui, selon lui, repr\u00e9sente 3 640 pages au total. Pour ce seul motif, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande, au motif qu\u2019elle est excessivement on\u00e9reuse.\n[10] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse aux observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le plaignant ne s\u2019oppose pas sp\u00e9cifiquement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce qu\u2019englobe la demande. Il soutient que le volume de documents all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est exag\u00e9r\u00e9 et mentionne qu\u2019il a une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information en instance visant l\u2019ensemble de son dossier.\n[11] Il ne fait aucun doute que les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures pour atteinte aux droits de la personne du plaignant sont pertinentes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La pr\u00e9sente plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP, qui porte que constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III de la LCDP, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 14.1 ne peut concerner que des repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne en application de la LCDP aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\n[12] Les plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne en question sont identifi\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant les plaintes nos 20141166 et 20170936 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission (\u00ab les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures \u00bb). Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en 2014 et en 2017, respectivement. Le plaignant soutient que la psychologue a fait allusion aux plaintes ant\u00e9rieures en proc\u00e9dant \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation du risque plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e dans le rapport qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 devant la CLCC. Les informations concernant les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures sont donc potentiellement pertinentes. Cependant, je ne vois pas en quoi tout autre dossier de gestion de cas concernant le plaignant serait potentiellement pertinent. M\u00eame s\u2019il est vrai, comme le note le plaignant, que le Tribunal doit tenir compte de toutes les circonstances pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a une subtile odeur de discrimination, l\u2019\u00e9largissement de la port\u00e9e de sa demande de divulgation au del\u00e0 des questions directement li\u00e9es aux plaintes ant\u00e9rieures \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache.\n[13] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande du plaignant au titre de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment n\u2019est accord\u00e9e qu\u2019en partie, pour les documents qui font mention des plaintes ant\u00e9rieures ou qui y sont directement li\u00e9s.\n(ii) Tout dossier de la correspondance entre la Commission et le plaignant ou toute discussion concernant les plaintes que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es devant la Commission entre le 7 novembre 2014 et le 13 ao\u00fbt 2018 qui figurent dans les dossiers du SCC, y compris les dossiers de gestion de cas du plaignant\n[14] Ces documents sont probablement compris dans la demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente dans la mesure o\u00f9 ils sont en la possession de l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que le plaignant aurait re\u00e7u toute correspondance lui \u00e9tant adress\u00e9e de la part de la Commission. En outre, il soutient que toute copie de la correspondance entre la Commission et le plaignant qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans sa liste de documents et \u00e9tait donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9e.\n[15] Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient aussi que la correspondance avec la Commission concernant les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures n\u2019est pas pertinente. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments ayant trait aux plaintes ant\u00e9rieures sont potentiellement pertinents. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que laisse entendre l\u2019intim\u00e9, la divulgation de ces informations au plaignant ne constitue pas une partie de p\u00eache.\n[16] La demande du plaignant est accord\u00e9e en ce qui concerne tout document qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9.\n(iii) Les courriels pertinents envoy\u00e9s ou re\u00e7us par le personnel du SCC, y compris ceux qui comportent des discussions au sujet des plaintes que le plaignant a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9 est convenu de divulguer ces documents. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, il indique qu\u2019il examine ces courriels pour expurger tout renseignement confidentiel et qu\u2019il les enverra au plaignant sous peu. Je fais remarquer une fois de plus que ces documents et ceux qui font l\u2019objet des deux premi\u00e8res demandes peuvent se chevaucher.\n(iv) La d\u00e9cision de la CLCC d\u2019accorder au d\u00e9linquant Takahashi une mise en semi-libert\u00e9 en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt 2016\n[18] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le plaignant compare sa situation \u00e0 celle d\u2019un autre d\u00e9linquant (\u00ab Takahashi \u00bb), qui a obtenu sa lib\u00e9ration conditionnelle de la CLCC. Cette d\u00e9cision de la CLCC aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 relat\u00e9e dans les m\u00e9dias nationaux. Le plaignant soutient avoir demand\u00e9, en vain, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 une copie de la d\u00e9cision expurg\u00e9e de tout renseignement personnel non pertinent.\n[19] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme ne pas pouvoir fournir au plaignant des documents concernant d\u2019autres d\u00e9linquants ni \u00eatre responsable de la divulgation de documents en la possession de la CLCC. Il maintient aussi que, bien que la d\u00e9cision Takahashi ne soit pas pertinente, le plaignant pourrait en demander une copie directement \u00e0 la CLCC, ce qu\u2019il a d\u2019ailleurs fait en novembre 2021 et, apparemment, il attend toujours une r\u00e9ponse.\n[20] Il appert que cette d\u00e9cision de la CLCC est du domaine public. Selon la Loi sur le syst\u00e8me correctionnel et la mise en libert\u00e9 sous condition, L.C. 1992, ch. 20, art. 143 et 144 (LSCMLC), la CLCC doit tenir un dossier des proc\u00e9dures dont elle est saisie et donner acc\u00e8s \u00e0 son registre \u00e0 toute personne qui d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle a un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un cas particulier. Par cons\u00e9quent, le plaignant peut faire une telle demande et, apparemment, il l\u2019a faite.\n[21] Bien que, habituellement, les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate rendues par des organes d\u00e9cisionnels soient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme faisant autorit\u00e9 et ne soient pas incluses dans le processus de divulgation documentaire, le plaignant semble avoir l\u2019intention d\u2019utiliser la d\u00e9cision Takahashi dans un contexte diff\u00e9rent en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve dans son dossier. Par cons\u00e9quent, je suis d\u2019avis que cette d\u00e9cision est potentiellement pertinente. Bien que le plaignant ait apparemment demand\u00e9 une copie \u00e0 la CLCC, il semble qu\u2019il ne l\u2019ait pas encore re\u00e7ue. Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 est en possession de la d\u00e9cision Takahashi, il doit en fournir une copie au plaignant. La demande du plaignant est accord\u00e9e.\n(v) Une copie des transcriptions et des pi\u00e8ces de l\u2019audience et du proc\u00e8s de d\u00e9claration de d\u00e9linquant dangereux que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a re\u00e7ues\n[22] Le plaignant indique que le rapport de la psychologue faisait mention de son \u00e9valuation en tant que d\u00e9linquant dangereux qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9e en 1999. L\u2019intim\u00e9 lui a dit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais re\u00e7u une copie de cette \u00e9valuation. Vers 2016, le plaignant a appris que la CLCC avait une copie de l\u2019\u00e9valuation, ce qui l\u2019a incit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9poser des griefs contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour avoir omis de veiller \u00e0 ce que les renseignements le concernant soient aussi exacts et \u00e0 jour que possible, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 24(1) de la LSCMLC. Les griefs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9s.\n[23] Toutefois, dans la correspondance qu\u2019il a re\u00e7ue de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en novembre 2022, le plaignant a appris que, d\u00e8s 2002 ou 2003, l\u2019intim\u00e9 poss\u00e9dait des transcriptions de l\u2019audience de d\u00e9claration de d\u00e9linquant dangereux. Le plaignant soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 des actes de tromperie relativement aux documents qu\u2019il a re\u00e7us et qui sont en sa possession et qu\u2019il doit, pour \u00eatre transparent, fournir les informations demand\u00e9es.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne poss\u00e9dait pas ces documents. Il soutient avoir simplement dit au plaignant que ces documents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pertinents.\n[25] Le plaignant n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli la pertinence de ces documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019objet de la plainte \u2014 \u00e0 savoir s\u2019il a fait l\u2019objet de repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 2014 et en 2017. La demande concernant cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment est rejet\u00e9e.\n(vi) Une copie des manuels contenant les crit\u00e8res et les instructions pour les outils d\u2019\u00e9valuation psychologique et du risque et toute autre documentation du d\u00e9veloppeur de ces outils :\nSTABLE-2007\nSTATIQUE-99\nPCL-R\n[26] Le plaignant affirme que la psychologue a utilis\u00e9 ces outils pour l\u2019\u00e9valuer. Il se demande si elle a bien appliqu\u00e9 ces outils et soutient que son \u00e9valuation ne concordait pas avec celle d\u2019un autre psychologue qui l\u2019avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Le plaignant maintient que les copies doivent lui \u00eatre remises puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9 a l\u2019intention de faire t\u00e9moigner la psychologue lors de l\u2019audience.\n[27] L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que la divulgation des manuels contreviendrait \u00e0 l\u2019article 50 du Code de d\u00e9ontologie des psychologues, RLRQ, c. C-26, r. 2012, qui indique que le psychologue ne doit pas compromettre la valeur m\u00e9thodologique et m\u00e9trologique d\u2019un test et, \u00e0 cet effet, il ne remet pas le protocole au client ou \u00e0 un tiers qui n\u2019est pas psychologue. Le plaignant met en doute cette affirmation en soulignant qu\u2019une copie du manuel PCL lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remise lors de son audience de d\u00e9claration de d\u00e9linquant dangereux en 2000, mais qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a plus.\n[28] Toutefois, en d\u00e9pit de savoir si cette divulgation contreviendrait \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation, j\u2019estime que ces informations ne sont pas pertinentes pour les questions de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. La question soumise au Tribunal ne consiste pas \u00e0 r\u00e9\u00e9valuer le bien-fond\u00e9 clinique du rapport de la deuxi\u00e8me psychologue ni \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si son \u00e9valuation concordait avec celle du premier psychologue. Ces questions doivent \u00eatre soulev\u00e9es devant la CLCC. La question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce consiste \u00e0 savoir si toute conclusion d\u00e9favorable tir\u00e9e dans le rapport de la deuxi\u00e8me psychologue du fait que le plaignant avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures constitue des repr\u00e9sailles pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ces plaintes, en violation de l\u2019article 14.1 de la LCDP.\n[29] La demande du plaignant au titre de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment est rejet\u00e9e.\nV. ORDONNANCE\n[30] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de divulguer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments ci-dessous au plus tard le 21 avril 2023.\nUne copie de tout document dans les dossiers de gestion de cas du SCC concernant le plaignant, entre le 7 novembre 2014 et le dossier actuel, qui fait mention des plaintes nos 20141166 et 20170936 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de la Commission (les plaintes ant\u00e9rieures) ou qui y est directement li\u00e9, y compris tout dossier de correspondance entre la Commission et le plaignant et tout courriel envoy\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u par le personnel du SCC dans lequel il est question des plaintes ant\u00e9rieures. L\u2019intim\u00e9 peut expurger tout renseignement personnel concernant des personnes autres que le plaignant. Il peut conserver tous les documents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels il invoque un privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation, mais ces documents doivent \u00eatre identifi\u00e9s dans une liste indiquant les motifs du privil\u00e8ge invoqu\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 20(1) des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal.\nUne copie de la d\u00e9cision Takahashi, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a en sa possession.\nSign\u00e9 par\nAthanasios Hadjis\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 21 mars 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : HR-DP-2845-22\nIntitul\u00e9 :\nFrank Kim c.

Introduction\n[1] Quinze personnes (deux plaignants et treize non-plaignants ayant obtenu le statut de partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, collectivement appel\u00e9s le \u00ab groupe des GCRP \u00bb ou le \u00ab groupe \u00bb), qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate combin\u00e9e ou regroup\u00e9e d\u2019indemnisation en 2014 en vertu du protocole d\u2019entente de 2012 (le \u00ab PE \u00bb), ont demand\u00e9 le 7 novembre 2022 que je me r\u00e9cuse en tant que membre instructeur (pour des raisons d\u2019injustice all\u00e9gu\u00e9e et de crainte de partialit\u00e9 et pour conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats per\u00e7u) et leur accorde un ajournement de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue ce mois\u2011l\u00e0 sur les fonctions admissibles. Apr\u00e8s avoir lu les observations des parties, consult\u00e9 la jurisprudence et m\u00fbrement r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi, j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement le 24 novembre 2022 avec motifs \u00e0 suivre. Le jour suivant, le groupe retirait sa requ\u00eate relative aux fonctions admissibles, l\u2019audience \u00e0 venir \u00e9tait ajourn\u00e9e et le dossier \u00e9tait clos dans l\u2019attente des motifs du Tribunal. Voici les motifs de ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nII. Contexte de l\u2019instance principale Walden et du protocole d\u2019entente\n[2] Le groupe se compose de quinze gestionnaires de cas de r\u00e9adaptation professionnelle (les \u00ab GCRP \u00bb) \u00e0 la section des prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada dans le minist\u00e8re rebaptis\u00e9 Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (\u00ab EDSC \u00bb). (Deux membres de ce groupe, Karen Pick et Andrea Taylor, ont re\u00e7u une indemnit\u00e9 Walden \u00e0 titre de plaignantes pour leur travail \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00e9valuatrices m\u00e9dicales (les \u00ab EM \u00bb) et avaient donc d\u00e9j\u00e0 qualit\u00e9 pour compara\u00eetre devant le Tribunal. Par cons\u00e9quent, elles sont incluses dans \u00ab Walden et al.\u00bb dans l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause ou le titre de l\u2019instance.) En 2014, le groupe a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) en vue d\u2019obtenir le r\u00e9examen de l\u2019indemnisation et autres r\u00e9parations par EDSC, faisant valoir plus particuli\u00e8rement que leur travail de GCRP r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb au sens du PE, qui est l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement de 2012.\n[3] Le PE est l\u2019aboutissement de plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Ruth Walden et 416 autres plaignants entre 2004 et 2007. Ceux\u2011ci contestaient ainsi la classification des \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux, groupe form\u00e9 majoritairement d\u2019infirmi\u00e8res associ\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation et au r\u00e8glement des demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 du R\u00e9gime de pensions du Canada (le \u00ab RPC \u00bb). Ce groupe \u00e9tait \u00e0 comparer au groupe des conseillers m\u00e9dicaux (les \u00ab CM \u00bb) form\u00e9 majoritairement d\u2019hommes m\u00e9decins travaillant aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s des EM. Les plaignants de l\u2019instance Walden all\u00e9guaient que, du fait de leur classification, les conseillers m\u00e9dicaux recevaient plus en salaire, avantages sociaux, reconnaissance professionnelle et perspectives de carri\u00e8re que les EM, bien que les deux groupes ex\u00e9cutent un m\u00eame travail d\u2019\u00e9valuation et de r\u00e8glement des demandes de prestations d\u2019invalidit\u00e9 adress\u00e9es au RPC. Ils ont fait valoir avec succ\u00e8s que cela \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 une distinction d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, au sens des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H\u20116, et ses modifications (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb). La d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire : voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Walden, 2010 CF 490. Voir aussi les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal sur la responsabilit\u00e9 (2007 TCDP 56) et la r\u00e9paration (2009 TCDP 16), le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision sur la r\u00e9paration (2010 CF 1135) et l\u2019appel (2011 CAF 202).\n[4] Le PE a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu et sign\u00e9 le 3 juillet 2012. Le 31 juillet 2012, le Tribunal rendait une ordonnance sur consentement mettant en \u0153uvre les dispositions du PE. Il r\u00e9servait sa pleine comp\u00e9tence pour r\u00e9gler tout diff\u00e9rend ou controverse quant au sens ou \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du protocole d\u2019entente \u00e0 la demande de toute partie ou de quiconque aurait pu exercer les fonctions admissibles au sens du PE. Il a d\u2019abord r\u00e9serv\u00e9 sa comp\u00e9tence jusqu\u2019au 30 juin 2014 et ensuite par voie de prorogation jusqu\u2019au 31 mars 2015 pour trancher toute requ\u00eate en cours (en ce qui concerne notamment les fonctions admissibles) \u00e0 ladite date. Il demeurait saisi de l\u2019affaire sur consentement au\u2011del\u00e0 de cette date pour la seule question des paiements de majoration. En novembre 2019, la partie r\u00e9siduelle de l\u2019\u00e9tape relative \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de la r\u00e9paration dans l\u2019instance Walden comprenait les requ\u00eates pour fonctions admissibles du groupe des GCRP et une autre requ\u00eate venant d\u2019un GCRP \u00e0 la retraite, laquelle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e pour raisons m\u00e9dicales.\n[5] Il convient de noter que la demande relative aux fonctions admissibles du groupe n\u2019est pas une plainte nouvelle et distincte pour discrimination qui porte sur la responsabilit\u00e9 ou la r\u00e9paration que pr\u00e9voit la LCDP. La requ\u00eate en indemnisation int\u00e9resse une entente de r\u00e8glement, en l\u2019occurrence le protocole d\u2019entente, dans le contexte de la partie r\u00e9siduelle de l\u2019\u00e9tape de mise en \u0153uvre de la r\u00e9paration dans l\u2019instance Walden.\nIII. Requ\u00eate du groupe des GCRP en r\u00e9examen des fonctions admissibles\n[6] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9, le groupe a introduit sa requ\u00eate le 27 juin 2014. Les parties ont tenu seize conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires portant sur des questions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience concernant notamment des requ\u00eates en divulgation, une demande visant \u00e0 limiter la d\u00e9position des t\u00e9moins d\u2019une partie, une requ\u00eate au sujet de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience, etc. La m\u00e9diation du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, mais refus\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Les parties ont eu des communications [traduction] \u00ab sous toutes r\u00e9serves \u00bb et \u00e0 des fins de r\u00e8glement tout au long de leur d\u00e9marche en indemnisation en vertu du protocole d\u2019entente. Les d\u00e9cisions, ordonnances et directives ont abond\u00e9 tout au long de l\u2019affaire, certains par \u00e9crit (et vers\u00e9s, par exemple, dans la base de donn\u00e9es Internet de CanLII, \u00e0 l\u2019adresse www.CanLII.org) et d\u2019autres de vive voix ou par correspondance du Tribunal (lettres r\u00e9sumant les conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques, par exemple) et, bien s\u00fbr, tous int\u00e9gr\u00e9s au dossier officiel.\n[7] Le groupe est pass\u00e9 par diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes de repr\u00e9sentation, d\u2019abord par d\u2019autres membres du groupe, Gary Goodwin et Carol Ladouceur, de 2014 \u00e0 2021 et en 2022 respectivement, avec de brefs remplacements tout au long de cette p\u00e9riode par divers avocats. Le 22 septembre 2021, M. Goodwin d\u00e9missionnait de son poste de repr\u00e9sentant principal. Quant \u00e0 Mme Ladouceur, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e par moi comme derni\u00e8re repr\u00e9sentante pour d\u00e9faut de collaboration ou de r\u00e9ponse, le 21 janvier 2022. Chaque membre du groupe a d\u00e8s lors \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme agissant pour son propre compte. Apr\u00e8s une lettre aux parties et la convocation d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire le 11 mars 2022, un autre membre du groupe, Aubrey Brenton, a envisag\u00e9 de repr\u00e9senter le groupe avec l\u2019aide de M. Goodwin, de Mme Ladouceur et des autres membres. Il a confirm\u00e9 sa volont\u00e9 de repr\u00e9senter le groupe et re\u00e7u l\u2019accord de celui\u2011ci en avril 2022. Il en reste le seul repr\u00e9sentant.\n[8] Apr\u00e8s une longue gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience et apr\u00e8s une divulgation et une production documentaire volumineuses par les parties, des dates d\u2019audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es pour novembre 2017 \u00e0 Victoria, en Colombie-Britannique. Malheureusement, M. Goodwin devait subir une intervention chirurgicale pendant cette p\u00e9riode; il allait de soi qu\u2019il avait besoin de se r\u00e9tablir par la suite. Sur consentement, j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement et pr\u00e9vu de nouvelles dates d\u2019audience d\u00e8s que l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 recevait le feu vert des m\u00e9decins. (L\u2019affaire n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en suspens; la gestion de l\u2019instance se poursuivait, comme on peut le voir dans les motifs du Tribunal du 10 novembre 2017.)\n[9] Heureusement, M. Goodwin a pu reprendre ses fonctions de repr\u00e9sentant principal, et l\u2019affaire a re\u00e7u en gestion d\u2019instance de nouvelles dates d\u2019audience avec mesures d\u2019adaptation, pr\u00e9vues un an apr\u00e8s, en novembre 2018. Malheureusement et l\u00e0 encore pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, M. Goodwin a demand\u00e9 un ajournement ou une suspension jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019obtention du feu vert des m\u00e9decins. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9. J\u2019ai accord\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement. Ni Carol Ladouceur comme corepr\u00e9sentante ni un autre membre du groupe n\u2019a voulu assumer la t\u00e2che de repr\u00e9sentant principal, ce que je comprends. Je signale que j\u2019ai avis\u00e9 le groupe de vive voix et par \u00e9crit qu\u2019il ne pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 se voir accorder des ajournements perp\u00e9tuellement et automatiquement. Celui\u2011ci devait concevoir d\u2019autres plans de repr\u00e9sentation (que ce soit par un avocat, un parajuriste ou d\u2019autres membres du groupe). J\u2019ai insist\u00e9 sur l\u2019importance de voir aboutir l\u2019affaire et l\u2019\u00e9tape de mise en \u0153uvre de la r\u00e9paration dans l\u2019instance Walden.\n[10] Par ailleurs, je m\u2019\u00e9tais rang\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019id\u00e9e du groupe proposant que je permute la file d\u2019attente en ce qui concerne les fonctions admissibles en mettant en suspens la requ\u00eate du groupe et en reprenant l\u2019instruction de l\u2019autre requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles qui \u00e9tait en suspens sur consentement. (Une autre ex\u2011GCRP avait retir\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles le 7 octobre 2019.) La requ\u00eate en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9activ\u00e9e et mise au r\u00f4le. Malheureusement et pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales, elle n\u2019a pu suivre son cours. L\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9e a re\u00e7u son cong\u00e9 avec mesures d\u2019adaptation, puis le feu vert des m\u00e9decins a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 une fois de plus. \u00c0 ce jour, son affaire demeure ajourn\u00e9e sans date de reprise fix\u00e9e dans l\u2019attente d\u2019une autorisation m\u00e9dicale.\n[11] Du 17 octobre 2018 au 21 janvier 2022, la requ\u00eate du groupe a \u00e9t\u00e9 en suspens. (M. Goodwin avait \u00e9crit le 9 juillet 2020 qu\u2019il demeurait incapable [traduction] \u00ab ind\u00e9finiment en raison de la nature chronique de [son] \u00e9tat \u00bb de reprendre ses fonctions et d\u2019agir comme repr\u00e9sentant principal \u00e0 une audience. Aucun document m\u00e9dical \u00e0 jour n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni et je n\u2019en ai exig\u00e9 aucun.) Toutefois, comme il \u00e9tait probable que la demande de la GCRP retrait\u00e9e ne soit pas entendue de sit\u00f4t, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, de tenir une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire avec le groupe pour discuter des \u00ab prochaines \u00e9tapes \u00bb, et notamment de l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 de la lev\u00e9e de la suspension. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 que le groupe (ou du moins ses corepr\u00e9sentants) ont cess\u00e9 de collaborer. Il y a eu plus d\u2019une tentative en vue d\u2019obtenir des dates de disponibilit\u00e9 de M. Goodwin et de Mme Ladouceur par correspondance et par appel ou message de l\u2019agente du greffe du Tribunal. Aucune r\u00e9ponse n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue de Mme Ladouceur.\n[12] Finalement, M. Goodwin a envoy\u00e9 le 22 septembre 2021 un courriel m\u00e9morable de d\u00e9mission de son poste de repr\u00e9sentant principal. Le message \u00e9tait piment\u00e9 de propos p\u00e9joratifs et d\u2019une m\u00e9taphore color\u00e9e emprunt\u00e9e au base-ball \u00e0 l\u2019adresse du Tribunal :\n[traduction]\nIl est vrai que j\u2019ai beaucoup tard\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de dates de disponibilit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire. La faute est mienne [\u2026] je suppose que je n\u2019aurais pas d\u00fb trop m\u2019en \u00e9tonner (que le Tribunal d\u00e9sire tenir une conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire pour discuter de la lev\u00e9e de l\u2019ajournement), mais j\u2019ai eu comme impression au cours des sept ann\u00e9es de notre requ\u00eate au TCDP que, lorsque Me Marchildon disait de sauter, le r\u00e9flexe du Tribunal \u00e9tait souvent de demander \u00ab \u00e0 quelle hauteur \u00bb.\n[\u2026]\nJe m\u2019excuse d\u2019avance de cette m\u00e9taphore sportive simpliste, mais l\u2019impression \u00e9tait souvent que nous \u00e9tions une \u00e9quipe des petites ligues affrontant les Yankees de New York des ann\u00e9es 1950 et du d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1960 et que l\u2019arbitre \u00e9tait le cousin de Mickey Mantle (\u00e0 l\u2019insu de tous). Nous d\u00e9crochions parfois un coup s\u00fbr, mais comme par une simple erreur de notre part, alors que les points par un fil conc\u00e9d\u00e9s au marbre \u00e9taient presque tous en faveur des Yankees. Nous n\u2019avons jamais eu l\u2019ombre d\u2019une chance vraiment.\n[13] En r\u00e9ponse au courriel du 22 septembre 2021 de M. Goodwin, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 le 4 octobre 2021 une lettre aux parties pour aviser M. Goodwin et le groupe que les all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 sont chose s\u00e9rieuse et que la bonne proc\u00e9dure consiste pour une partie \u00e0 soulever lesdites questions \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion sous forme de requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation du membre avec preuve et sources juridiques \u00e0 l\u2019appui. Le groupe n\u2019a agi en ce sens qu\u2019au moment de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation le 7 novembre 2022 (en fonction de son document \u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du 1er novembre 2022), soit treize mois apr\u00e8s.\n[14] N\u2019ayant pas re\u00e7u de dates de disponibilit\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants du groupe, le Tribunal n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant et d\u2019organiser une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire avec toutes les parties qui, \u00e0 toutes fins utiles, \u00e9taient toujours repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 par Mme Ladouceur. \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence du 21 janvier 2022 ont assist\u00e9 quatre membres du groupe, ainsi que l\u2019avocate et le client de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Mme Ladouceur, qui ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9e comme repr\u00e9sentante. \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique subs\u00e9quente tenue le 11 mars 2022 ont assist\u00e9 de m\u00eame quatre membres du groupe et l\u2019avocate et le client de l\u2019intim\u00e9. C\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re pr\u00e9sence de M. Brenton. Celui\u2011ci a dit qu\u2019il ferait savoir s\u2019il n\u2019agirait que pour son propre compte ou s\u2019il repr\u00e9senterait un ou plusieurs membres du groupe, apr\u00e8s consultation des int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Le 11 avril 2022, il d\u00e9clarait qu\u2019il assumerait le r\u00f4le de repr\u00e9sentant principal.\n[15] Le Tribunal a consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps et de ressources pour aider M. Brenton \u00e0 se plonger dans le dossier et \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 une audience. Nous avons convenu de procurer \u00e0 M. Brenton les principaux documents au dossier et toute autre pi\u00e8ce qu\u2019il pourrait demander. J\u2019ai dit clairement \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique qu\u2019il lui incombait de faire conna\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019agente du greffe, Judy Dubois, les documents dont il aurait besoin. Celle\u2011ci a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer et envoyer les documents principaux et autres et \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux autres demandes de M. Brenton. Elle a fourni la documentation sous sa forme \u00e9lectronique habituelle, mais aussi sur papier selon le d\u00e9sir de M. Brenton. (La situation \u00e9tait inhabituelle, puisque, en temps normal, un nouveau repr\u00e9sentant d\u2019une partie re\u00e7oit le dossier de celui qui l\u2019a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.) J\u2019ai \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 que le dossier de l\u2019autre requ\u00eate de la GCRP pour fonctions admissibles soit mis \u00e0 la disposition du groupe avec le consentement de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. J\u2019ai pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il pourrait \u00eatre bon, comme les questions sont les m\u00eames dans la requ\u00eate du groupe, que M. Brenton voie la liste des t\u00e9moins, les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus et la table des pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es avec toute copie demand\u00e9e des documents en question.\n[16] Le Tribunal a en outre fix\u00e9 des dates limites de modification des listes de t\u00e9moins d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es et des r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus de 2018, ainsi que des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances de divulgation et de production suppl\u00e9mentaires. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question d\u2019autres points \u00e0 la reprise de la gestion de l\u2019instance en 2022, et notamment de la comparution propos\u00e9e de l\u2019avocat retrait\u00e9 Laurence Armstrong de l\u2019instance Walden, ainsi que du mode et du lieu d\u2019audience (en personne, par Zoom ou en s\u00e9ance hybride).\n[17] J\u2019avais dit croire que les parties pourraient en venir \u00e0 une entente en produisant un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits ou une demande commune de sorte que le Tribunal ne tire pas une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du d\u00e9faut des parties de convoquer Me Armstrong ou Me Marchildon ayant n\u00e9goci\u00e9 le protocole d\u2019entente et devant alors \u00eatre appel\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur l\u2019intention des parties signataires du PE. Faute d\u2019une entente et au cas o\u00f9 le groupe \u00e9tait toujours d\u00e9sireux de convoquer Me Armstrong, le groupe devait, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2018 TCDP 20, donner avis \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance Walden et \u00e0 Me Armstrong en leur procurant la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations au sujet de la lev\u00e9e du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements. J\u2019ai fix\u00e9 de courts d\u00e9lais \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire du 20 septembre 2022, puisque l\u2019audience de trois semaines devait d\u00e9buter le 28 novembre 2022. Les parties ont fini par n\u00e9gocier une entente et Me Armstrong a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 de la liste des t\u00e9moins du groupe.\n[18] La gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9alable a eu lieu en pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience du 28 novembre 2022. Les listes de t\u00e9moins, les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus et les pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 divulguer ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produits. L\u2019intim\u00e9 avait accept\u00e9 de prendre en charge la pr\u00e9paration du cahier de preuve documentaire conjoint (pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es) avec l\u2019aide de M. Brenton. Le cahier (contenant moins de 400 documents) n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9, le groupe s\u2019\u00e9tant retir\u00e9 du processus pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience et ayant plut\u00f4t pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement le 7 novembre 2022.\nIV. Requ\u00eate rapide en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement du groupe des GCRP\n[19] Le 20 octobre 2022, je refusais la demande du groupe de passer d\u2019une audience par Zoom au mode hybride (en personne et par Zoom). C\u2019est ce qui devait pr\u00e9cipiter la pr\u00e9sentation de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement que le groupe annon\u00e7ait douze jours apr\u00e8s par son \u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du 1er novembre 2022. Il en sera question plus en d\u00e9tail dans les motifs qui suivent.\n[20] Le Tribunal avait pr\u00e9vu une nouvelle conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique le 24 octobre 2022 pour traiter de questions pr\u00e9alables \u00e0 l\u2019audience, mais la s\u00e9ance a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e au dernier moment et report\u00e9e au 3 novembre. Le 1er novembre 2022 cependant, le groupe adressait \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal un \u00ab appel \u00bb de ma d\u00e9cision au sujet de Zoom. Il all\u00e9guait que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait injuste et partiale \u00e0 son endroit et qu\u2019il percevait un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats. Il voulait que la pr\u00e9sidente annule ma d\u00e9cision et me fasse remplacer comme membre instructeur et que l\u2019ajournement soit accord\u00e9. La pr\u00e9sidente a r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit le lendemain qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas ce pouvoir et que la bonne proc\u00e9dure pour le groupe \u00e9tait de soulever la question devant le membre instructeur. (Le Tribunal avait avis\u00e9 le groupe par ses repr\u00e9sentants il y a plus d\u2019un an, dans sa correspondance du 4 octobre 2021, du protocole ou de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 appliquer pour soulever les questions d\u2019injustice ou de partialit\u00e9.)\n[21] Le Tribunal a avis\u00e9 les parties de son intention de tenir une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pour pr\u00e9parer l\u2019audience, traiter des questions en suspens relatives \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance et r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du 1er novembre 2022 et \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement. Comme autres points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour, il y avait le moment \u00e0 trouver pour une s\u00e9ance pratique d\u2019utilisation de Zoom avec tout le monde, comme les parties y avaient consenti \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence du 6 juin 2022, ainsi que la question du tableau des r\u00e9parations que j\u2019avais vu par inadvertance et qui relevait du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements.\n[22] \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence du 3 novembre 2022, le Tribunal a trait\u00e9 uniquement de l\u2019\u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb et de la demande d\u2019ajournement du groupe. Les autres points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour ont \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9s. La conf\u00e9rence suivante devait avoir lieu le 7 novembre 2022 et traiter [traduction] \u00ab des dates limites de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement et d\u2019une date pour une autre conf\u00e9rence o\u00f9 il serait question des derniers points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour de la conf\u00e9rence du 3 novembre 2022 \u00bb.\n[23] \u00c0 ce stade, aucun ajournement de l\u2019audience \u00e0 venir n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 et la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience du 21 novembre 2022 se poursuivait de pair avec la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement. M. Brenton avait accept\u00e9 d\u2019assister \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 7 novembre 2022, mais pour se raviser comme je l\u2019avais lu dans ses cinq courriels (envoy\u00e9s au Tribunal depuis la fermeture des bureaux le vendredi), soit 16 minutes avant que ne commence la conf\u00e9rence du lundi 7 novembre. Le repr\u00e9sentant du groupe ne participerait pas. Dans un de ses courriels, il demandait au Tribunal de traiter l\u2019\u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du 1er novembre 2022 du groupe comme son avis de requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement et la pi\u00e8ce principale de cette requ\u00eate. La conf\u00e9rence a eu lieu (le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9crit et l\u2019enregistrement audio ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis au groupe).\n[24] J\u2019ai fix\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais pour la r\u00e9ponse et la r\u00e9plique, qui arrivaient \u00e0 terme le 16 novembre 2022. (La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ne participait pas \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur les fonctions admissibles et n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019observations dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement.) Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la lettre r\u00e9sumant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, j\u2019ai dit que je ferais [traduction] \u00ab de mon mieux \u00bb pour rendre une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate avec motifs (ou avec motifs \u00e9crits \u00e0 suivre \u00ab en temps opportun \u00bb) au plus tard le vendredi pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le lundi 21 novembre, le jour o\u00f9 l\u2019audience devait d\u00e9buter. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 une prorogation \u00e0 Me Marchildon pour qu\u2019elle voie si M. Brenton mettrait la derni\u00e8re main au cahier de preuve documentaire conjoint des parties (pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es).\n[25] Ce que nous avons appris par la suite, c\u2019est qu\u2019il y avait eu un probl\u00e8me technique et que les documents de requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 (observations et sources) avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s, mais sans \u00eatre re\u00e7us par le greffe du Tribunal (et je suppose qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us par le groupe) \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 10 novembre. C\u2019est ainsi que, le 15 novembre 2022, le Tribunal a prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai de signification et de d\u00e9p\u00f4t jusqu\u2019au 21 novembre 2022 pour les observations en r\u00e9plique du groupe. Il y a ainsi eu report des dates d\u2019audience pour la premi\u00e8re semaine pr\u00e9vue d\u2019audition du 21 au 25 novembre 2022. Dans la lettre r\u00e9sumant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, figurait le passage suivant, mis en relief par soulignement : [traduction] \u00ab Nous rappelons aux parties que, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019un ajournement ne soit accord\u00e9, l\u2019audience commencera le 28 novembre 2022. Les parties continueront en cons\u00e9quence \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer leurs causes respectives en pr\u00e9vision de l\u2019audience. \u00bb\n[26] Le groupe s\u2019est grandement offusqu\u00e9 de cette d\u00e9cision en faisant observer \u00e0 juste titre que je n\u2019avais pas sollicit\u00e9 les observations des parties. Et le groupe avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa r\u00e9plique le 17 novembre 2022. L\u2019intim\u00e9 avait \u00e9crit ce qui suit le 14 novembre 2022 : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] EDSC est pr\u00eat \u00e0 accorder un court d\u00e9calage pour le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, de sorte que le membre du Tribunal ait le temps n\u00e9cessaire pour d\u00fbment \u00e9tudier la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation du groupe. \u00bb M. Brenton a encore \u00e9crit au sujet de l\u2019opposition du groupe \u00e0 cette ordonnance et le Tribunal a r\u00e9pliqu\u00e9 le 22 novembre 2022. Je remarque que, en aucun moment avant que je ne proroge le d\u00e9lai de r\u00e9plique et ne reporte la premi\u00e8re semaine d\u2019audience, le groupe n\u2019avait communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal pour l\u2019aviser d\u2019avoir effectivement re\u00e7u les documents \u00e9lectroniques de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la date limite initiale.\n[27] L\u2019ajournement partiel a laiss\u00e9 onze jours de plus au groupe pour se pr\u00e9parer uniquement \u00e0 l\u2019audience, son travail sur la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation \u00e9tant termin\u00e9. C\u2019est l\u00e0 quelque chose que je pensais \u00eatre bien accueilli, car M. Brenton s\u2019\u00e9tait plaint de la difficult\u00e9 de pr\u00e9parer cette requ\u00eate et l\u2019audience en m\u00eame temps et du d\u00e9lai dont il disposait \u00e0 cette fin. Je mentionne enfin que le report de la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la r\u00e9plique et l\u2019ajournement partiel m\u2019ont donn\u00e9 le temps suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u00e9cessaire pour lire et m\u00e9diter les observations et la jurisprudence pour une requ\u00eate des plus s\u00e9rieuses. J\u2019ai ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de rendre le 24 novembre 2022 une d\u00e9cision (avec motifs \u00e0 suivre) sur la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement. (Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9, le groupe a choisi de retirer la requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles le 25 novembre 2022 et j\u2019ai alors ajourn\u00e9 l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue pour le 28 novembre.)\nV. Questions en litige\n[28] Le Tribunal doit trancher les questions suivantes :\nLe groupe a-t-il renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 son droit de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation?\nS\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas fait, a-t-il d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir raisonnablement une crainte de partialit\u00e9 ou une perception de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats telle que j\u2019aurais \u00e0 me r\u00e9cuser?\nLe courriel du 4 novembre 2022 de M. Brenton rel\u00e8ve\u2011t\u2011il d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge?\nL\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue pour le 28 novembre 2022 aurait-elle d\u00fb \u00eatre ajourn\u00e9e?\nVI. Principes juridiques\n[29] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les observations et la jurisprudence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par les parties. Je m\u2019appuie en particulier sur les principes juridiques applicables qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision fort bien \u00e9tay\u00e9e du membre Gaudreault sur une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour partialit\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Constantinescu c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2020 TCDP 3.\nA. Renonciation\n[30] La \u00ab renonciation \u00bb repr\u00e9sente un vieux concept en common law selon lequel une partie ne soulevant pas d\u2019objection de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion renonce volontairement au droit de le faire par la suite. Il s\u2019agit de dissuader la partie de \u00ab r\u00e9server \u00bb ou d\u2019accumuler les objections ou les all\u00e9gations en cours d\u2019instance quant \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9 du d\u00e9cideur. On peut consid\u00e9rer qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une tactique abusive. Si la partialit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas invoqu\u00e9e \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion ou imm\u00e9diatement quand la partie en a connaissance ou devrait en avoir connaissance, la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de la crainte de partialit\u00e9 est remise en question : voir les paragraphes 10 et 33, la d\u00e9cision Constantinescu, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et le paragraphe 48 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Eckervogt v. Colombie-Britannique, 2004 BCCA 398. Le manque de diligence d\u2019une partie peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9 \u00e0 un acquiescement \u00e0 la poursuite de l\u2019instance.\nB. Crainte de partialit\u00e9\n[31] Les all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 sont tr\u00e8s graves et touchent au c\u0153ur de la confiance qu\u2019a le public non seulement dans le d\u00e9cideur et le tribunal en question, mais aussi dans l\u2019administration de la justice en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Elles peuvent avoir de graves r\u00e9percussions sur le Tribunal (et le d\u00e9cideur) et ne devraient donc pas servir de strat\u00e9gie d\u2019instance ou \u00eatre prises \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re par une partie : voir Hennessey c. Canada, 2016 CAF 180. Ainsi, de telles all\u00e9gations exigent que la partie \u00e9tablisse l\u2019existence de motifs s\u00e9rieux de fond et les pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion.\n[32] Les juges et les arbitres doivent s\u2019acquitter de leurs fonctions sans pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s ni parti pris et aussi sans apparence de partialit\u00e9 : voir Bande indienne Wewaykum c. Canada, 2003 CSC 45, aux paragraphes 57 et 58. \u00ab L\u2019essence de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 est l\u2019obligation qu\u2019a le juge d\u2019aborder avec un esprit ouvert l\u2019affaire qu\u2019il doit trancher. \u00bb : voir ibid., au paragraphe 58.\n[33] Le membre du Tribunal est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 agir de mani\u00e8re impartiale dans l\u2019exercice de sa fonction quasi judiciaire jusqu\u2019\u00e0 preuve du contraire : voir Association des employeurs maritimes c. Syndicat des d\u00e9bardeurs, section locale 375, 2020 CAF 29, au paragraphe 5.\n[34] Par ailleurs, au paragraphe 75 de la d\u00e9cision Constantinescu, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le membre Gaudreault rappelle \u00ab qu\u2019en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9cusation, face \u00e0 la forte pr\u00e9somption d\u2019impartialit\u00e9 dont jouissent les d\u00e9cideurs, incluant ceux des tribunaux administratifs, une erreur, m\u00eame r\u00e9visable, n\u2019est pas suffisante afin d\u2019appuyer une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Il faut plus afin de remplir ce lourd fardeau de preuve; l\u2019erreur ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec la partialit\u00e9 [renvois omis]. \u00bb\n[35] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a arr\u00eat\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re permettant d\u2019\u00e9tablir si un d\u00e9cideur doit se r\u00e9cuser \u00e0 cause d\u2019une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 : que conclurait une personne inform\u00e9e qui consid\u00e9rerait la question de fa\u00e7on r\u00e9aliste et pratique? La preuve doit \u00eatre convaincante : Committee for Justice and Liberty c. L\u2019Office national de l\u2019\u00e9nergie, [1978] 1 R.C.S. 369, aux pages 394 et 395. La partie qui fait valoir la partialit\u00e9 a une preuve solide \u00e0 faire : Cojocaru c. British Columbia Women\u2019s Hospital and Health Centre, [2013] 2 R.C.S. 357,au paragraphe 22; Arsenault-Cameron c. \u00cele\u2011du\u2011Prince\u2011\u00c9douard, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 851, au paragraphe 2.\nVII. Positions des parties\n[36] Selon le groupe des GCRP, [traduction] \u00ab sur toutes ces ann\u00e9es, un certain nombre de questions et de demandes, etc., ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 ce que nous estimons \u00eatre depuis 2014 un constant traitement injuste du groupe par le membre Garfield [\u2026] \u00bb Pr\u00e8s du haut de la page 1 des observations initiales ou principales du 1er novembre 2022 au sujet de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation, le groupe d\u00e9clare souhaiter [traduction] \u00ab appeler \u00bb de la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente du Tribunal \u00ab [\u2026] ayant injustement refus\u00e9 [la] demande d\u2019audience hybride (en partie en personne, en partie par Zoom) \u00bb.Voici ce qu\u2019\u00e9crit M. Brenton au bas de la page 1 des observations du groupe : [traduction] \u00ab Je commencerai par parler de notre demande d\u2019audience hybride et de l\u2019incidence n\u00e9gative de la d\u00e9cision du membre Garfield sur ma capacit\u00e9 de conduire notre affaire. \u00bb Selon le groupe, ce serait l\u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab seulement la plus r\u00e9cente d\u2019une s\u00e9rie de d\u00e9cisions injustes du membre contre [le] groupe depuis l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2014 o\u00f9 [celui-ci] a adress\u00e9 [sa] requ\u00eate initiale au TCDP \u00bb.\n[37] Comme il en sera question plus loin, ma d\u00e9cision de tenir l\u2019audience par Zoom a \u00e9t\u00e9 le catalyseur ou la bougie d\u2019allumage de cette requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour partialit\u00e9 et en ajournement. Elle fait aussi l\u2019objet de la premi\u00e8re des huit grandes all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 formul\u00e9es dans les observations du groupe. C\u2019est ce qui ressort de l\u2019observation suivante du groupe : [traduction] \u00ab L\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 [M. Brenton] a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 contrec\u0153ur une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation avec l\u2019appui du groupe seulement apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut lui\u2011m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 t\u00e9moin, \u00e9tant devenu repr\u00e9sentant principal, du traitement injuste par le membre Garfield, et notamment du refus par celui\u2011ci de notre requ\u00eate d\u2019audience hybride l\u2019emp\u00eachant de conduire l\u2019audience au mieux de ses capacit\u00e9s. \u00bb\n[38] Le groupe a aussi \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] ce pass\u00e9 d\u2019injustice est l\u2019indice que le membre Garfield nourrit depuis longtemps des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s favorisant le gouvernement du Canada et son avocate principale dans notre affaire, Lynn Marchildon, et d\u00e9favorisant notre groupe non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9. \u00bb Autre d\u00e9claration : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] nous savons seulement que diverses d\u00e9cisions et attitudes d\u00e9favorables du membre Garfield au fil des ans font voir une tendance \u00e0 l\u2019injustice qui devait amener une telle conclusion. \u00bb Le groupe ajoute : [traduction] \u00ab Il sera enfin question de ce qui [nous] appara\u00eet \u00e0 tout le moins comme une apparence de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats en ce qui concerne la participation du membre Garfield \u00e0 notre affaire ou peut-\u00eatre \u00e0 toute affaire du TCDP o\u00f9 le gouvernement du Canada est l\u2019intim\u00e9. \u00bb\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement. Il soutient que les all\u00e9gations ne satisfont pas aux crit\u00e8res juridiques tr\u00e8s exigeants d\u2019une r\u00e9cusation pour crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. EDSC affirme plut\u00f4t que, par sa requ\u00eate, le groupe [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019attaque aux d\u00e9cisions prises par le Tribunal il y a des ann\u00e9es, ce pour quoi le bon recours est une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de ces d\u00e9cisions, et non une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9. \u00bb Il pr\u00e9tend \u00e9galement que la d\u00e9cision prise par le Tribunal le 20 octobre 2022 de tenir l\u2019audience par Zoom \u00e9tait raisonnable et faisait ressortir les mesures d\u2019assistance que j\u2019avais demand\u00e9es pour M. Brenton \u00e0 St. John\u2019s, Terre-Neuve\u2011et\u2011Labrador, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab ses pr\u00e9occupations au sujet des d\u00e9fis techniques d\u2019une audience \u00e0 distance \u00bb.\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9crivait aussi :\n[traduction]\nAu mieux, les all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 du groupe sont le reflet d\u2019une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension du r\u00f4le du Tribunal dans le jugement \u00e0 porter sur sa requ\u00eate. Dans le pire des cas, les all\u00e9gations d\u2019injustice, de partialit\u00e9 et de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats de la part du Tribunal fr\u00f4lent dangereusement l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Tout au long des huit ans de leur requ\u00eate et comme le dit leur requ\u00eate en ajournement et r\u00e9cusation de 18 pages, le groupe a accus\u00e9 EDSC et son avocate d\u2019extorsion, de menaces, d\u2019inconduite professionnelle et de communication d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e avec le Tribunal, et ce, \u00e0 seule fin de forcer EDSC \u00e0 renoncer \u00e0 l\u2019audience et \u00e0 indemniser les membres du groupe conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement.\n[41] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait en outre valoir qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats ni r\u00e9el ni appr\u00e9hend\u00e9 quant \u00e0 mon travail d\u2019expert-conseil aupr\u00e8s de RCAAN. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un contrat de 2011 \u00e0 2018 avec mon entreprise, ADR Synergy Inc., et de mon r\u00f4le d\u2019adjudicateur des demandes d\u2019indemnisation pour s\u00e9vices pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par d\u2019anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves des pensionnats indiens. L\u2019avocate \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Les membres [\u00e0 temps partiel] du Tribunal travaillent souvent dans d\u2019autres entreprises ou lieux de travail et continuent en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 exercer leurs fonctions de d\u00e9cideurs administratifs. \u00bb De plus, EDSC affirme que le groupe savait qu\u2019il existait un contrat [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e8s les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es de sa requ\u00eate [2016] \u00bb et n\u2019avait pourtant pris la d\u00e9cision de soulever la question que le 1er novembre 2022, six ans apr\u00e8s. Cela remet encore une fois [traduction] \u00ab en question la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations de crainte de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du membre du Tribunal \u00bb.\nVIII. Question li\u00e9e \u00e0 la preuve : courriel du 4 novembre 2022\n[42] Le 7 novembre 2022, M. Brenton a envoy\u00e9 un courriel \u00e0 Me Marchildon (avec copie au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission) pour lui demander de supprimer un courriel (\u00e0 l\u2019intention d\u2019un membre de son groupe) qu\u2019il avait envoy\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t par inadvertance, mais qui \u00e9tait parvenu accidentellement au Tribunal et aux autres parties. Me Marchildon lui avait signal\u00e9 cette erreur. M. Brenton avait agi d\u00e8s qu\u2019il avait eu connaissance de la situation.\n[43] Le diff\u00e9rend tient au fait que Me Marchildon souhaitait que le Tribunal interpr\u00e8te la chose comme rev\u00eatant [traduction] \u00ab une grande pertinence \u00bb pour la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate et d\u00e9montrant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9judiciable pour les motifs du groupe que [traduction] \u00ab ses objectifs vont plus loin que l\u2019ajournement et comprennent l\u2019intention de forcer EDSC \u00e0 recourir \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation pour r\u00e9gler sa demande d\u2019indemnisation \u00bb. L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cela t\u00e9moigne de la mauvaise foi du groupe :\n[traduction]\nCette strat\u00e9gie s\u2019inscrit dans toute une conduite adopt\u00e9e par M. Goodwin qui, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019admettre que le seul moyen de trancher la requ\u00eate du groupe est de passer par une audience du Tribunal, consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il y a lieu pour le groupe de continuer \u00e0 chercher des moyens de contourner cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent, le groupe a concentr\u00e9 ses all\u00e9gations d\u2019injustice contre EDSC et son avocate. Maintenant, il se tourne vers le Tribunal lui\u2011m\u00eame, dans l\u2019espoir que le d\u00e9lai ind\u00e9fini caus\u00e9 par l\u2019affectation d\u2019un nouveau membre du Tribunal forcera de nouveau EDSC \u00e0 r\u00e9gler la demande du groupe.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le courriel en question ne rel\u00e8ve pas du privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige.\n[44] Le groupe s\u2019est vivement oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal admette ce courriel en preuve pour la requ\u00eate, faisant valoir que celui\u2011ci est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le privil\u00e8ge de la consultation juridique, bien que M. Brenton ne soit ni avocat ni parajuriste autoris\u00e9 : voir Chancey v. Dharmadi (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 612 (S.C.J.). Le groupe a soutenu que je ne devrais m\u00eame pas le lire et que les observations \u00e9crites de l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 cernant la nature m\u00eame du courriel \u00e9taient irrecevables.\n[45] J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 que le courriel soit mis sous scell\u00e9 le 7 novembre 2022 et, ayant examin\u00e9 les observations, j\u2019ai \u00e9galement prorog\u00e9 l\u2019ordonnance de cette mise sous scell\u00e9 lorsque j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement le 24 novembre, rendant cette mesure permanente, tout en ordonnant \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et \u00e0 la Commission de supprimer leur copie du courriel. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement jug\u00e9 inutile pour moi de prendre connaissance du contenu effectif de ce courriel, m\u00eame s\u2019il m\u2019\u00e9tait loisible de le faire : voir M.(A.) c. Ryan, [1997] 1 R.C.S. 157, au paragraphe 39. Je m\u2019en suis remis aux observations des parties, et notamment \u00e0 la description, la caract\u00e9risation et la d\u00e9finition de la nature du courriel en cause.\n[46] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence, j\u2019ai la conviction que le courriel, quelque pertinent qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre, est n\u00e9anmoins prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la communication \u00e9crite entre M. Brenton, repr\u00e9sentant du groupe sans \u00eatre avocat, et l\u2019un des membres de ce groupe rel\u00e8ve de la cat\u00e9gorie des privil\u00e8ges relatifs au litige. J\u2019ajoute que l\u2019arr\u00eat phare sur ce privil\u00e8ge indique clairement que l\u2019absence de qualit\u00e9 d\u2019avocat de M. Brenton n\u2019entre pas en ligne de compte : voir Blank c. Canada (Ministre de la Justice), 2006 CSC 39. \u00c0 la diff\u00e9rence du secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat, le privil\u00e8ge relatif au litige se forme et produit son effet m\u00eame hors de toute relation avocat-client, s\u2019appliquant sans distinction \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00e0 un litige, qu\u2019elles soient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ou non par un avocat : voir Alberta (Treasury Branches) v. Ghermezian (1999), 242 A.R. 326, 1999 ABQB 407.\n[47] J\u2019estime que l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9vitement des litiges \u00bb comme objet du courriel, \u00e0 en croire les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9, peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une \u00ab strat\u00e9gie d\u2019instance \u00bb. J\u2019estime \u00e9galement qu\u2019aucune exception au privil\u00e8ge ne s\u2019applique en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et que la divulgation par inadvertance n\u2019est pas abandon ni annulation de la protection que conf\u00e8re ce privil\u00e8ge.\nIX. Analyse : les huit all\u00e9gations\n[48] Le groupe a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 huit grandes all\u00e9gations. Je vais me pencher sur les principaux points et arr\u00eater mes conclusions, mais sans m\u2019attacher \u00e0 tous les arguments en d\u00e9tail. J\u2019adopte l\u2019approche du membre Gaudreault dans la d\u00e9cision Constantinescu, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 54 : \u00ab Dans un souci d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de concision, et comme plusieurs arguments soumis ne sont pas pertinents et ne m\u2019aident en rien \u00e0 trancher cette requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation, j\u2019aborderai seulement les arguments des parties que je juge n\u00e9cessaires, essentiels et pertinents aux fins de rendre une d\u00e9cision \u00bb (Turner c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) [Turner], 2012 CAF 159, au para. 40). Je signale que les d\u00e9tails peuvent \u00eatre relev\u00e9s dans les nombreuses d\u00e9cisions (avec motifs), ordonnances et directives, les lettres r\u00e9sumant les conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires, la correspondance du Tribunal et les observations des parties au cours des ann\u00e9es de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles. Tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments appartiennent au dossier officiel du Tribunal.\n[49] Il convient \u00e9galement de noter qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour crainte de partialit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas le bon moyen pour une contestation de fait des d\u00e9cisions et des ordonnances ant\u00e9rieures du Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. \u00ab Elle n\u2019a pas non plus pour objet que je justifie \u00e0 nouveau les d\u00e9cisions que j\u2019ai rendues. Si une partie n\u2019est pas satisfaite d\u2019une d\u00e9cision, il lui est toujours loisible de d\u00e9poser une demande en contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb : voir Constantinescu, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 76.\n[50] J\u2019ajoute qu\u2019il importe de bien voir que m\u00eame une erreur susceptible de r\u00e9vision ne suffit pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer la partialit\u00e9. Comme je le dis dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, les principaux arguments du groupe dans cette requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour partialit\u00e9 visent principalement les r\u00e9sultats de mes nombreuses d\u00e9cisions \u2013 sur requ\u00eate et autres \u2013, ordonnances et directives tout au long de cette requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles. J\u2019ai tenu compte des autres motifs de plainte, y compris de l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative \u00e0 l\u2019apparence de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats.\n[51] \u00c0 noter que je formerai mes conclusions pour chacune des huit grandes all\u00e9gations sous l\u2019angle de la renonciation et aussi sur le fond. \u00c0 cause de la gravit\u00e9 d\u2019une telle requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour partialit\u00e9, je juge important d\u2019analyser le bien-fond\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations et d\u2019y aller de conclusions subsidiaires m\u00eame dans les cas o\u00f9 je rejette l\u2019all\u00e9gation apr\u00e8s avoir conclu avant tout \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une renonciation volontaire. C\u2019est aussi l\u2019approche retenue dans la d\u00e9cision Constantinescu, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, au paragraphe 30.\nA. All\u00e9gation no 1 : demande d\u2019audience hybride\n[52] Apr\u00e8s avoir discut\u00e9 des diverses possibilit\u00e9s qui s\u2019offrent pour le lieu et le mode d\u2019audience (en personne, par Zoom ou en mode hybride avec certains participants en personne \u00e0 St. John\u2019s et par Zoom, et le reste des t\u00e9moins et des parties par Zoom), les parties se sont entendues sur une audience par Zoom seulement, \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 6 juin 2022. Toutefois, avant la conf\u00e9rence du 20 septembre 2022, M. Brenton a envoy\u00e9 un courriel indiquant que le groupe souhaitait d\u00e9sormais que l\u2019audience ait lieu en mode hybride (en personne et par Zoom). Au cours de cette conf\u00e9rence, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 question de cette nouvelle demande. M. Brenton a dit, ce que confirme la lettre r\u00e9sumant cette conf\u00e9rence, que le mode hybride \u00e9tait selon lui [traduction] \u00ab le meilleur moyen pour lui de pr\u00e9senter sa cause \u00bb. Il a aussi \u00e9voqu\u00e9 des probl\u00e8mes technologiques en ce qui concerne son propre ordinateur et l\u2019utilisation du logiciel Zoom. Il a en outre demand\u00e9 du mat\u00e9riel suppl\u00e9mentaire. J\u2019ai inform\u00e9 les parties que, apr\u00e8s l\u2019apparition de la COVID (en f\u00e9vrier 2020), [traduction] \u00ab les audiences du Tribunal par Zoom avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle et non l\u2019exception \u00bb. (En fait, au moment de mon refus de la demande faite par le groupe de passer de Zoom au mode hybride le 20 octobre 2022, toutes les audiences depuis l\u2019apparition de la pand\u00e9mie avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues par Zoom seulement, sans exception.) Je signale qu\u2019une partie peut marquer sa pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour un mode technologique d\u2019audience, mais sans avoir le droit de l\u2019exiger, m\u00eame en agissant par voie de consentement : voir Cousins v. Silbourne, 2022 ONSC 4000.\n[53] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a indiqu\u00e9 le 11 octobre 2022 qu\u2019il acc\u00e9dait \u00e0 la demande du groupe. J\u2019ai regard\u00e9 par la suite les motifs et les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de vive voix et par \u00e9crit par M. Brenton avec les facteurs \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans la communication de septembre 2022 \u00ab Message de la pr\u00e9sidente : audiences en personne et virtuelles \u00bb sur le site Web du Tribunal, message que les parties avaient re\u00e7u. Le 20 octobre 2022, j\u2019ai rendu ma d\u00e9cision par \u00e9crit avec motifs. Ma lettre disait que j\u2019\u00e9tais persuad\u00e9 qu\u2019une audience \u00e9quitable et accessible pouvait avoir lieu par Zoom et que le groupe ne subirait aucun pr\u00e9judice.\n[54] Il devait s\u2019agir d\u2019une audience o\u00f9 les parties et les t\u00e9moins se r\u00e9partiraient entre six fuseaux horaires, depuis Victoria, en Colombie-Britannique, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 St. John\u2019s, \u00e0 Terre-Neuve\u2011et\u2011Labrador. L\u2019audience ne serait pas plus ou moins accessible ou \u00e9quitable si tout le monde participait \u00e0 distance par Zoom ou si moi, l\u2019agente du greffe, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et repr\u00e9sentante du client et M. Brenton (avec l\u2019un de ses t\u00e9moins) nous trouvions dans la m\u00eame pi\u00e8ce et toutes les autres parties (14) ou t\u00e9moins (13) \u00e0 distance par Zoom. J\u2019avais pris en consid\u00e9ration les pr\u00e9occupations d\u2019ordre technologique de M. Brenton et son peu de familiarit\u00e9 avec Zoom. Mais lorsque je mettais cet aspect en balance avec les autres consid\u00e9rations dans ma d\u00e9cision, ce qui ressortait comme r\u00e9sultat \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier \u00e9tait de ne pas passer de Zoom au mode hybride.\n[55] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 des mesures d\u2019adaptation qui aideraient M. Brenton \u00e0 r\u00e9gler certaines des difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il avait soulev\u00e9es (technologie, installation ou milieu non propice \u00e0 son domicile, etc.), m\u00eame s\u2019il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une demande d\u2019adaptation pour handicap au titre de la LCDP. Ainsi, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 qu\u2019une salle de conf\u00e9rences convenable dot\u00e9e d\u2019une connexion Internet Wi-Fi soit pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 St John\u2019s, de sorte que M. Brenton puisse assister \u00e0 l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai aussi demand\u00e9 qu\u2019un ordinateur portable soit lou\u00e9 \u00e0 son usage. (Il aurait aussi pu recevoir sur papier le cahier de preuve documentaire conjoint (pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es) pour plus de commodit\u00e9, comme je l\u2019avais demand\u00e9 pour moi\u2011m\u00eame.) L\u2019agente du greffe aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e0 pour l\u2019aider (et toute autre partie ou tout autre t\u00e9moin) pour les questions technologiques avant et pendant l\u2019audience.\n[56] Je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention de citer toute la d\u00e9cision ici; elle fait partie, bien s\u00fbr, du dossier officiel. Je tiens n\u00e9anmoins \u00e0 faire valoir certains points. D\u2019abord, je sais que M. Brenton n\u2019est pas avocat, et que c\u2019est la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il est repr\u00e9sentant et partie devant le Tribunal. La repr\u00e9sentation des parties \u00e0 l\u2019audience peut \u00eatre intimidante et stressante. Toutefois, son h\u00e9sitation devant une audience par Zoom semble tenir en grande partie \u00e0 son peu de familiarit\u00e9 avec ce programme.\n[57] Dans son courriel du 28 septembre 2022 au Tribunal, M. Brenton a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab J\u2019ai expos\u00e9 dans cet appel mon grand motif pour faire une telle demande. L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de cette forme d\u2019audience et la disponibilit\u00e9 de la technologie et des outils comptent parmi les raisons pour lesquelles je mets cette demande de l\u2019avant. \u00bb Le groupe soutient \u00e9galement dans sa requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation que le refus du Tribunal de passer en mode hybride est si s\u00e9rieux et [traduction] \u00ab si contraire \u00e0 [la] capacit\u00e9 de tenir une audience \u00e9quitable [qu\u2019il n\u2019a] pas d\u2019autre choix que de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation [\u2026] \u00bb. Je n\u2019accepte pas cette derni\u00e8re phrase.\n[58] Au tout d\u00e9but, c\u2019est\u2011\u00e0\u2011dire d\u00e8s la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 6 juin 2022, les parties avaient accept\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 une s\u00e9ance pratique sur Zoom avec le Tribunal. Cela aurait satisfait \u00e0 toute pr\u00e9occupation et r\u00e9pondu aux questions gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une d\u00e9monstration en temps r\u00e9el, y compris pour l\u2019utilisation de documents \u00e9lectroniques. J\u2019ai \u00ab connaissance d\u2019office \u00bb que le programme ou l\u2019application Zoom est tr\u00e8s convivial et utilis\u00e9 par des millions de personnes dans le monde, y compris par les tribunaux canadiens. L\u2019agente du greffe, Mme Dubois, aurait agi \u00e0 titre d\u2019\u00ab h\u00f4te \u00bb de Zoom en cours d\u2019audience, s\u2019occupant des aspects techniques. Tout ce que M. Brenton et les autres participants auraient eu \u00e0 faire est d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un ordinateur avec une connexion Internet et d\u2019entrer en communication par Zoom pour la conf\u00e9rence. Malheureusement, au moment o\u00f9 nous devions fixer la date de la s\u00e9ance pratique, le groupe ne participait plus au processus pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience et n\u2019avait plus en t\u00eate que sa requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement.\n[59] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que ma d\u00e9cision du 20 octobre 2022 (comprenant les mesures d\u2019assistance que j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9es) \u00e9tait raisonnable et n\u2019accr\u00e9ditait surtout pas une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 de ma part. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de mon examen de la d\u00e9cision du 20 octobre 2022 ainsi que des observations et de la jurisprudence pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette requ\u00eate rapide, je conclus que le refus par le Tribunal de la demande faite par le groupe de passer \u00e0 une audience hybride n\u2019autorise pas une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. La d\u00e9cision du 20 octobre \u00e9tait raisonnable et soupesait les divers facteurs applicables sans aucune apparence de partialit\u00e9.\n[60] \u00c0 son plus fort, une all\u00e9gation d\u2019erreur concernant une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal pourrait justifier un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, sans pour autant constituer en soi une preuve de partialit\u00e9, r\u00e9elle ou appr\u00e9hend\u00e9e. Le refus du Tribunal d\u2019engager des co\u00fbts importants (notamment en d\u00e9placements) selon la demande faite par une partie de changer le mode d\u2019audience deux mois avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audition d\u2019une requ\u00eate, par exemple, n\u2019est pas une preuve de partialit\u00e9. C\u2019est d\u2019autant plus le cas lorsque la partie demandant ce changement n\u2019a m\u00eame pas jug\u00e9 bon de se servir des moyens offerts par le Tribunal pour faciliter sa participation \u00e0 une audience par Zoom \u00e0 laquelle les deux parties avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 consenti.\nB. All\u00e9gation no 2 : t\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9 de Me Armstrong\n[61] L\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 du groupe porte ici sur le processus de convocation de Laurence Armstrong, avocat aupr\u00e8s de la plupart des plaignants de l\u2019instance Walden, en vue de t\u00e9moigner de l\u2019intention des parties jusqu\u2019au moment inclusivement o\u00f9 ont eu lieu les discussions ayant d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 sur le protocole d\u2019entente officialis\u00e9. Ce sont Me Marchildon et lui qui ont n\u00e9goci\u00e9 ce protocole. Le groupe fait valoir que le processus de convocation de Me Armstrong autorise une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 de la part du Tribunal.\n[62] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a comme argument \u00e0 opposer que le groupe devrait \u00eatre forclos s\u2019il entend pr\u00e9senter cette all\u00e9gation dans sa requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation de 2022, [traduction] \u00ab puisque le groupe a soulev\u00e9 ces questions aussi t\u00f4t qu\u2019en 2016 et que le Tribunal s\u2019est prononc\u00e9 l\u00e0\u2011dessus en 2018 [\u2026] \u00bb.\n[63] Les questions de divulgation et l\u2019intention de convoquer Me Armstrong ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement \u00e9voqu\u00e9es en 2016 par le groupe. Comme en t\u00e9moignent ses observations dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation, le groupe \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 et clairement en d\u00e9saccord quant \u00e0 mon interpr\u00e9tation et mon application de la d\u00e9finition des \u00ab fonctions admissibles \u00bb du PE dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision Walden et al. c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada, 2015 TCDP 15 (d\u00e9cision \u00ab McIlroy \u00bb sur les fonctions admissibles). La question de la convocation de Me Armstrong avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience et les questions connexes : voir 2016 TCDP 19, au paragraphe 29.\n[64] J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 en 2016 et par la suite que je m\u2019interrogeais sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de convoquer Me Armstrong (ou au demeurant Me Marchildon comme autre personne ayant n\u00e9goci\u00e9 le PE). J\u2019ai invit\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 tenter de parvenir \u00e0 une solution sous forme d\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits, de demande commune produite pour qu\u2019une conclusion d\u00e9favorable ne soit pas tir\u00e9e, etc. Les parties ont fini par conclure une entente en 2022 et le nom de Me Armstrong a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 de la liste des t\u00e9moins par le groupe.\n[65] En 2018, le groupe d\u00e9sirait toujours que Me Armstrong t\u00e9moigne. La Commission (qui participait alors aux conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires) et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient tous deux d\u2019avis que ce t\u00e9moignage comporterait des communications relevant du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements, ce qui exigerait que toutes les parties \u00e0 l\u2019instance Walden (et non les seules parties repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par Me Armstrong) en soient avis\u00e9es et aient la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations sur la requ\u00eate en disant si elles renoncent ou non au privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements et si celui\u2011ci devrait \u00eatre lev\u00e9. (La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont dit ne pas renoncer au privil\u00e8ge).\n[66] Dans ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2018 TCDP 20, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 au groupe aux paragraphes 35 et 36 de signifier \u00e0 toutes les parties et \u00e0 Me Armstrong son avis de requ\u00eate en vue de faire lever le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements et de permettre \u00e0 celui\u2011ci de t\u00e9moigner sur les questions vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour fonctions admissibles. Ma d\u00e9cision et l\u2019ordonnance qui l\u2019accompagne sont des plus claires. Le Tribunal \u00e9crit au paragraphe 37 : \u00ab Si le groupe Goodwin souhaite proc\u00e9der, le Tribunal donnera une directive concernant les \u201cprochaines \u00e9tapes\u201d \u00e0 suivre et traitant des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre logistique qu\u2019implique un groupe aussi important \u00bb.\n[67] Le groupe ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas r\u00e9uni \u00e0 la date limite du 13 juillet 2018 que fixait l\u2019ordonnance pour faire savoir au Tribunal s\u2019il recherchait une citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour contraindre Me Armstrong et aller de l\u2019avant avec sa requ\u00eate en production d\u2019une des lettres en litige. Le Tribunal a notamment \u00e9crit ce qui suit aux parties le 20 juillet 2018 :\n[TRADUCTION]\nIl va sans dire que toute demande de modification d\u2019une ordonnance en prorogation ou autre devrait se faire avant toute date limite.\n[\u2026]\nMon ordonnance ne pr\u00e9cisait aucune condition (pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 dise s\u2019il souhaite participer \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation du Tribunal avant que le groupe Goodwin n\u2019indique s\u2019il entend continuer avec sa requ\u00eate en production et comparution).\n[\u2026]\nPar cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019aimerais convoquer une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire la semaine prochaine, si possible, pour traiter des questions soulev\u00e9es au paragraphe 37 de ma d\u00e9cision du 29 juin (admission, expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits et\/ou demande commune; protocole pour les \u00ab prochaines \u00e9tapes \u00bb si la requ\u00eate en production et comparution va de l\u2019avant).\n[68] Le groupe a confirm\u00e9 par \u00e9crit le 25 juillet 2018 qu\u2019il avait toujours l\u2019intention de faire t\u00e9moigner Me Armstrong. La lettre du Tribunal aux parties le jour suivant rel\u00e8ve un passage de la lettre du groupe : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] le groupe Goodwin n\u2019acceptera pas d\u2019assister \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence tant que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019aura pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019offre de services de m\u00e9diation du TCDP [\u2026] \u00bb Me Marchildon a indiqu\u00e9 le 4 septembre 2018 que [traduction] \u00ab EDSC avait inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne voulait pas faire usage des services de m\u00e9diation du Tribunal. J\u2019ai avis\u00e9 M. Goodwin et Mme Ladouceur de ce fait et de la raison dans un courriel distinct \u00e0 leur adresse \u00bb.\n[69] Si le groupe a mentionn\u00e9 le 25 juillet 2018 toujours souhaiter convoquer Me Armstrong, il a continu\u00e9 par la suite \u00e0 refuser de communiquer des dates de disponibilit\u00e9 pour une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique. Aucune conf\u00e9rence n\u2019a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 organis\u00e9e et une directive pour les \u00ab prochaines \u00e9tapes \u00bb a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite, puisque l\u2019audience pour fonctions admissibles qui devait d\u00e9buter le 5 novembre 2018 \u00e9tait ajourn\u00e9e sine die (sans date fix\u00e9e de reprise) pour raisons m\u00e9dicales le 17 octobre 2018 (les motifs d\u00e9taill\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9s le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2019).\n[70] Il ressort de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de que, si le groupe pouvait avoir ignor\u00e9 de quoi se composaient au juste les \u00ab prochaines \u00e9tapes \u00bb dans le processus visant \u00e0 contraindre Me Armstrong \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans le cadre de la d\u00e9cision 2018 TCDP 20, il savait ou aurait raisonnablement d\u00fb savoir que l\u2019avis devait \u00eatre signifi\u00e9 \u00e0 tous les plaignants de l\u2019instance Walden, \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 et \u00e0 Me Armstrong. Rien n\u2019indiquait que, en dehors du groupe, quelqu\u2019un aurait pour responsabilit\u00e9 de consacrer du temps et des frais \u00e0 la chose.\n[71] Par souci d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 cependant pour le groupe et dans le sens m\u00eame de ses observations aux pr\u00e9sentes, ses principales contestations portent sur le processus de convocation de Me Armstrong et sur les exigences pr\u00e9cises et d\u00e9taill\u00e9es, ce qui comprend les \u00e9tapes et les d\u00e9lais, ainsi que les ressources \u00e0 y affecter (temps et frais). Et le protocole des \u00ab prochaines \u00e9tapes \u00bb n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 par le menu avant la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9paratoire du 20 septembre 2022. Le gros du temps consacr\u00e9 aux points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour est all\u00e9 aux points no 2 [traduction] \u00ab T\u00e9moignage propos\u00e9 de Me Armstrong \u00bb et no 3 \u00ab Questions logistiques\/prochaines \u00e9tapes\/d\u00e9lais de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate \u00bb. J\u2019ai bien pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 une fois de plus que le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas pour r\u00f4le de signifier l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie avec les documents connexes. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement encourag\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 s\u2019exprimer et \u00e0 voir si elles pourraient trouver une solution de rechange n\u2019exigeant pas le t\u00e9moignage de Me Armstrong, ce sur quoi les parties ont fini par s\u2019entendre. De plus, j\u2019ai pass\u00e9 en revue les exigences de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2018 TCDP 20.\n[72] Les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s \u00e9taient brefs, puisque l\u2019audience devait d\u00e9buter deux mois apr\u00e8s, soit le 21 novembre 2022 (la date a ensuite \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 28 novembre 2022). Les d\u00e9lais \u00e9taient courts, mais pouvaient \u00eatre respect\u00e9s \u00e0 mon avis. La premi\u00e8re \u00e9ch\u00e9ance \u00e9tait le 30 septembre 2022 et la derni\u00e8re, le 7 novembre suivant. La d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si le privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements serait lev\u00e9 ou non devait \u00eatre rendue avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. (Le 7 octobre 2022, le Tribunal a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 deux demandes de prorogation du groupe. La nouvelle date limite devait \u00eatre le 14 novembre 2022 pour les observations en r\u00e9plique.) Le groupe a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait injuste, mais il n\u2019a jamais accus\u00e9 le Tribunal de partialit\u00e9 ni dit craindre la partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019envoi de l\u2019\u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb le 1er novembre 2022.\n[73] D\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le principe de renonciation ne s\u2019applique pas ici. Y allant d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et lib\u00e9rale, j\u2019estime que le groupe ignorait ce qu\u2019\u00e9taient au juste les besoins logistiques, et plus particuli\u00e8rement les d\u00e9lais \u00e0 respecter, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 20 septembre 2022, bien qu\u2019ayant su t\u00f4t \u00e0 qui l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate devait \u00eatre signifi\u00e9. Il a pris un peu plus d\u2019un mois avant de brandir le spectre de la partialit\u00e9 dans ce cas le 1er novembre 2022 et ensuite dans le courriel du 6 novembre 2022 constituant officiellement la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation \u00e0 mon endroit. Il convient de noter que le groupe a attendu apr\u00e8s la d\u00e9cision de refus par le Tribunal d\u2019une audience hybride le 20 octobre 2022 pour produire sa requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation, ce refus ayant catalys\u00e9 ou d\u00e9clench\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate.\n[74] Pour ce qui est de la question du processus de r\u00e9ception du t\u00e9moignage de Me Armstrong et de la question de savoir si elle autorise sur le fond une crainte de partialit\u00e9, mon avis est qu\u2019elle ne le d\u00e9montre pas. La d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait raisonnable, tout comme le protocole des \u00ab prochaines \u00e9tapes \u00bb. La question du t\u00e9moignage de Me Armstrong avait \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e en 2016, tranch\u00e9e en 2018 et reprise en 2022. Les d\u00e9lais impos\u00e9s relativement \u00e0 la convocation de l\u2019int\u00e9ress\u00e9 convenaient dans les circonstances si nous consid\u00e9rons que le groupe avait confirm\u00e9 en septembre 2022 toujours d\u00e9sirer convoquer celui\u2011ci \u00e0 l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue pour novembre suivant. Que les d\u00e9lais aient \u00e9t\u00e9 comprim\u00e9s et qu\u2019il ait fallu beaucoup de travail \u00e0 M. Brenton pour s\u2019y conformer, il y a l\u00e0 uniquement la cons\u00e9quence de la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019offrait de septembre \u00e0 novembre, et non d\u2019une injustice ou d\u2019une partialit\u00e9 de la part du Tribunal. En fait, le Tribunal a tent\u00e9 de faciliter le processus en fournissant des coordonn\u00e9es utiles et en sugg\u00e9rant une formulation au groupe. Que le Tribunal n\u2019ait pas assum\u00e9 la responsabilit\u00e9 pour le groupe de donner un avis appropri\u00e9 ne peut constituer le fondement de l\u2019acceptation d\u2019une requ\u00eate en partialit\u00e9. J\u2019en conclus que le groupe n\u2019a pas satisfait au crit\u00e8re exigeant relatif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une crainte de partialit\u00e9 selon cette all\u00e9gation.\nC. All\u00e9gation no 3 : document des GCRP relevant du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements et manque de r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations contre l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[75] Le groupe combine ici deux all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es dans le temps.\n[76] Dans ma d\u00e9cision 2016 TCDP 19 du 22 novembre 2016, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de par le groupe d\u2019\u00ab [un] tableau indiquant les r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9cises demand\u00e9es (indemnisation et reclassification) et les montants (s\u2019ils sont connus) ainsi que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par la demande, pour chacun des seize membres du groupe Goodwin, y compris laquelle des trois cat\u00e9gories de fonctions admissibles le membre invoque au titre du PE \u00bb. L\u2019avocat du groupe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, Jean\u2011Rodrigue Yoboua, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un tableau des r\u00e9parations le 6 f\u00e9vrier 2017. Il a par la suite produit \u00e0 ma demande, le 8 septembre 2017, un tableau r\u00e9vis\u00e9 plus d\u00e9taill\u00e9, soit le tableau des r\u00e9parations de septembre 2017 (le \u00ab tableau de septembre \u00bb), sous forme de feuille de calcul. Le tableau de septembre s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 utile.\n[77] Selon les all\u00e9gations, j\u2019aurais ind\u00fbment regard\u00e9 un document semblable, le tableau des r\u00e9parations en r\u00e8glement \u00ab sous toutes r\u00e9serves \u00bb d\u2019octobre 2017 (le \u00ab tableau d\u2019octobre \u00bb), \u00e9galement sous forme de feuille de calcul, lequel faisait \u00e9tat du montant demand\u00e9 pour chaque type d\u2019indemnisation et pour chacun des membres du groupe. Le document devait servir \u00e0 une discussion \u00e0 des fins de r\u00e8glement. Le tableau d\u2019octobre et d\u2019autres communications privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es entre les parties (dans le cadre des discussions ou des n\u00e9gociations ant\u00e9rieures de r\u00e8glement entre le groupe et l\u2019intim\u00e9) ont \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9s intentionnellement au Tribunal par le groupe en mai 2018. Ils r\u00e9sumaient les all\u00e9gations du groupe selon lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9 et son avocate principale s\u2019\u00e9taient livr\u00e9s \u00e0 des [traduction] \u00ab tromperies \u00bb, \u00e0 une \u00ab conduite contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9thique \u00bb et \u00e0 des n\u00e9gociations de r\u00e8glement \u00ab de mauvaise foi \u00bb. Selon ces m\u00eames pi\u00e8ces, il y avait eu [traduction] \u00ab tentative d\u2019extorsion par EDSC \u00bb contre l\u2019un des membres par la menace de retenir des sommes du r\u00e8glement Walden. Le groupe a fourni des documents (propositions de r\u00e8glement et courriels avec l\u2019intim\u00e9, dont le courriel de menaces all\u00e9gu\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Ladouceur et la correspondance du groupe avec les ministres de la Justice et d\u2019EDSC et le Barreau de l\u2019Ontario). Le groupe demandait que j\u2019intervienne [traduction] \u00ab pour prot\u00e9ger \u00bb ses membres contre les actions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de son avocate et pour qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate se tienne sur leurs agissements.\n[78] L\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 ce que je consulte ces documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les observations des deux parties, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas regarder lesdits documents, dont le tableau d\u2019octobre, et j\u2019en ai fait part aux parties par lettre du greffe le 29 juin 2018. Mes motifs \u00e9taient que le Tribunal ne surveille pas les discussions de r\u00e8glement entre les parties, qu\u2019il n\u2019y est pas lui\u2011m\u00eame partie et que, au reste, ma comp\u00e9tence se trouve limit\u00e9e par l\u2019ordonnance sur consentement \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation et la mise en \u0153uvre du PE et, apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 31 mars 2015, aux questions et requ\u00eates qui subsisteraient. S\u2019il y avait \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard une plainte distincte pour repr\u00e9sailles, par exemple, au titre de la LCDP, la partie l\u00e9s\u00e9e devait d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. (Une demande pour sept incidents de repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es (ant\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 ceux de mai 2018) par EDSC contre le groupe ayant pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles au Tribunal avait d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9e par M. Goodwin \u00e0 l\u2019occasion d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue en f\u00e9vrier 2016. J\u2019avais avis\u00e9 les parties que le groupe aurait \u00e0 d\u00e9poser un avis de requ\u00eate, notamment sur la question de la comp\u00e9tence. M. Goodwin avait indiqu\u00e9 le 26 avril 2016 que le groupe d\u00e9poserait plut\u00f4t une plainte pour repr\u00e9sailles aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.)) J\u2019ai bel et bien offert aux parties les services de m\u00e9diation d\u2019un membre du Tribunal pour les aider \u00e0 parvenir \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement, et avec la possibilit\u00e9 en plus de s\u2019occuper des questions et des agissements qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent. Le groupe, dont Mme Ladouceur, a opt\u00e9 pour d\u2019autres recours ou r\u00e9parations (en s\u2019adressant aux deux ministres de la Couronne et au Barreau de l\u2019Ontario).\n[79] \u00c0 ce stade, je n\u2019avais jet\u00e9 de coup d\u2019\u0153il sur aucun des documents en question, dont le tableau d\u2019octobre. Passons \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 11 mars 2022. (\u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente du 21 janvier 2022, la suspension avait \u00e9t\u00e9 lev\u00e9e.) Pour aider le nouveau repr\u00e9sentant en instance de confirmation, M. Brenton, \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab se mettre au courant \u00bb de ce dossier volumineux, le Tribunal a offert de rendre disponibles l\u2019ensemble du dossier et celui de la requ\u00eate semblable pour fonctions admissibles de l\u2019autre GCRP retrait\u00e9e. Il incombait, bien s\u00fbr, \u00e0 M. Brenton de passer en revue les pi\u00e8ces au dossier avec le groupe et de communiquer avec l\u2019agente du greffe pour recevoir les documents d\u00e9sir\u00e9s. (En temps normal, le repr\u00e9sentant de la partie qui l\u2019avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 aurait eu \u00e0 lui transmettre le dossier.) Pour aussi aider, le Tribunal s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer un recueil en PDF des [traduction] \u00ab principaux documents \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019intention des parties. Il ne s\u2019agissait pas d\u2019une liste exhaustive, le but \u00e9tant de pr\u00eater un soutien aux parties. L\u2019agente du greffe a pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ce fichier PDF et elle m\u2019a consult\u00e9 sur son contenu.\n[80] Malheureusement, l\u2019agente du greffe avait de bonne foi inclus le tableau d\u2019octobre par erreur dans le fichier PDF des principaux documents au lieu du tableau de septembre. Je n\u2019avais pas relev\u00e9 l\u2019erreur lorsque j\u2019avais examin\u00e9 la section\/case 9 (demande de Mme Ladouceur) de ce document en juin 2022 en pr\u00e9paration de la conf\u00e9rence du 6 juin sur la question \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour de l\u2019\u00e9ventuelle confirmation ou r\u00e9vision par le groupe de son tableau des r\u00e9parations. (J\u2019avais suppos\u00e9 que ce que j\u2019avais sous les yeux \u00e9tait le tableau de septembre \u00ab sous toutes r\u00e9serves \u00bb.) Cela dit, j\u2019avais seulement regard\u00e9 la section\/case 9 du tableau d\u2019octobre parce que je pr\u00e9voyais (et que je devais effectivement) demander \u00e0 M. Brenton de communiquer avec Mme Ladouceur au sujet de sa requ\u00eate initiale et distincte pour fonctions admissibles, d\u00e9sirant savoir si elle allait reporter tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de cette requ\u00eate sur sa demande \u00e0 titre de membre du groupe.\n[81] Le Tribunal et les parties n\u2019ont pas constat\u00e9 l\u2019erreur commise par inadvertance. Ce n\u2019est que le 27 septembre 2022 que le groupe a demand\u00e9 par \u00e9crit au Tribunal si j\u2019avais r\u00e9ellement vu le tableau d\u2019octobre et me souciais de tout effet tenant \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le premier \u00e0 avoir connaissance de l\u2019erreur. (L\u2019erreur a par la suite \u00e9t\u00e9 corrig\u00e9e lorsque le tableau d\u2019octobre a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 et remplac\u00e9 par le tableau de septembre dans le fichier PDF des \u00ab principaux documents \u00bb par l\u2019agente du greffe suivant mes instructions.) La demande et la pr\u00e9occupation du groupe \u00e9taient l\u00e9gitimes. \u00c0 ce jour, la demande est rest\u00e9e sans r\u00e9ponse. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision est ma premi\u00e8re r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande. Je juge r\u00e9trospectivement que j\u2019aurais d\u00fb r\u00e9pondre bien plus t\u00f4t. Selon ma r\u00e9flexion le jour du 27 septembre 2022, j\u2019avais \u00e0 inscrire ce point \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour de la toute prochaine conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, celle du 24 octobre 2022. En fait, il a figur\u00e9 comme point no 6 ([traduction] \u00ab Tableau des r\u00e9parations; question du privil\u00e8ge relatif aux r\u00e8glements \u00bb). Cette conf\u00e9rence a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 3 novembre 2022. Malheureusement \u00e0 cette occasion, M. Brenton a fait reporter la s\u00e9ance. Il consentait \u00e0 discuter du r\u00e9cent \u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du groupe et de la demande en cours, la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement d\u2019audience. J\u2019ai fix\u00e9 des dates limites de d\u00e9p\u00f4t pour cette requ\u00eate, puis j\u2019ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande de report du reste des points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour (dont le point 6) \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence ult\u00e9rieure, le 7 novembre 2022. Toutes les parties acceptaient d\u2019y assister. Toutefois, le dimanche soir pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant la conf\u00e9rence du lendemain matin, M. Brenton envoyait au Tribunal un courriel pour annoncer qu\u2019il n\u2019y assisterait pas. H\u00e9las, je n\u2019ai jamais eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019expliquer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 avec le tableau d\u2019octobre.\n[82] Si \u00e0 cette conf\u00e9rence il y avait eu discussion sur le fait que j\u2019aie vu le tableau d\u2019octobre (et plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, la section\/case 9 seulement), j\u2019aurais fait savoir que les parties n\u2019avaient subi aucun pr\u00e9judice. En ce qui concerne la requ\u00eate du groupe pour fonctions admissibles, les membres du Tribunal ont comme moi le droit de regarder les documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s et de voir, par exemple, si effectivement ils rel\u00e8vent d\u2019un privil\u00e8ge. C\u2019est ce que j\u2019ai fait sans opposition, par exemple, dans ma d\u00e9cision 2018 TCDP 20 sur la requ\u00eate en divulgation. Je fais remarquer que le tableau d\u2019octobre est celui\u2011l\u00e0 m\u00eame (comme partie d\u2019un ensemble de documents \u00ab sous toutes r\u00e9serves \u00bb ou privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s) que le groupe avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal en mai 2018 pour que je le lise, et ce, contre le gr\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[83] Pour ce qui est des deux volets de l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 3, je conclus que le principe de la renonciation ne s\u2019applique pas au fait que j\u2019aie lu par inadvertance la section\/case 9 du tableau d\u2019octobre, car le groupe n\u2019avait pas une vue d\u2019ensemble et ne connaissait pas jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent l\u2019explication du Tribunal. Sur le fond, j\u2019estime que ce que j\u2019ai pu faire par inadvertance n\u2019autorise pas une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[84] Pour ce qui est de l\u2019all\u00e9gation li\u00e9e dans les faits quant \u00e0 l\u2019absence de r\u00e9ponse du Tribunal \u00e0 la demande d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et de son avocate en contexte de r\u00e8glement, je conclus qu\u2019il y a renonciation volontaire. Le groupe \u00e9tait au fait de ma r\u00e9ponse par \u00e9crit avec motifs du 29 juin 2018. S\u2019il avait alors jug\u00e9 que ma r\u00e9ponse \u00e9tait si lacunaire qu\u2019elle autorisait une crainte de partialit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle ou apparente, il \u00e9tait tenu, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 de vieux principes reconnus en common law, de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour partialit\u00e9 le plus t\u00f4t possible ou \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re occasion, mais s\u00fbrement bien plus t\u00f4t qu\u2019en novembre 2022, soit plus de quatre ans apr\u00e8s. Au plus tard, il aurait d\u00fb produire son all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 tr\u00e8s peu de temps apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de la bonne proc\u00e9dure pour soulever de telles questions dans la lettre du 4 octobre 2021 du Tribunal r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la lettre de \u00ab d\u00e9mission \u00bb de M. Goodwin.\n[85] \u00c0 titre subsidiaire, je juge que, sur le fond, ce qu\u2019affirme le groupe \u00e0 propos de la fa\u00e7on dont j\u2019ai trait\u00e9 sa plainte contre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et son avocate n\u2019\u00e9tablit pas une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9. Les motifs que j\u2019ai donn\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, que je r\u00e9sume plus haut et qui figurent dans la correspondance du 29 juin 2018 du Tribunal, \u00e9taient raisonnables et d\u00e9nu\u00e9s de tout parti pris \u00e0 l\u2019endroit du groupe. Il n\u2019y a rien qui donne \u00e0 penser \u00e0 l\u2019existence de la partialit\u00e9 mis \u00e0 part l\u2019opposition du groupe \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal.\nD. All\u00e9gation no 4 : gestion des dates limites r\u00e9centes de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour la liste des t\u00e9moins et les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus\n[86] Cette all\u00e9gation du groupe porte sur mon annulation le 24 octobre 2022 [traduction] \u00ab au dernier moment \u00bb qui a caus\u00e9 de \u00ab grands inconv\u00e9nients \u00bb aux membres du groupe pr\u00e9voyant assister \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire. Le groupe rapproche ma r\u00e9action d\u2019un \u00e9v\u00e9nement ayant eu lieu en juillet 2018. La conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 24 octobre 2022 devait porter sur des questions relatives \u00e0 la gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience du 21 novembre 2022. Deux des points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour \u00e9taient les listes de t\u00e9moins et les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9vus des parties avec toute modification. Le Tribunal disposait de la documentation finale du groupe dans ces deux cas, mais l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait manqu\u00e9 son \u00e9ch\u00e9ance. J\u2019ai v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 mon compte de courriels du Tribunal le dimanche soir et le lundi matin (le 24 octobre). Comme je ne voulais pas couper la conf\u00e9rence en deux, j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9, au cas o\u00f9 les documents ne seraient toujours pas l\u00e0 le lundi matin, d\u2019ajourner la conf\u00e9rence le dimanche soir et de fixer une nouvelle date une fois que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait fourni les documents manquants.\n[87] Je comprends les inconv\u00e9nients qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s. Cependant, je voulais que le groupe et moi ayons ces documents et les traitions avec les autres points \u00e0 l\u2019ordre du jour en une seule conf\u00e9rence, compte tenu surtout de l\u2019imminence de l\u2019audience \u00e0 tenir. Je reconnais ne pas avoir cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 conna\u00eetre la position des parties. J\u2019\u00e9tais bouscul\u00e9 (n\u2019ayant que quelques heures). Me Marchildon s\u2019est excus\u00e9e par \u00e9crit de ne pas avoir respect\u00e9 la date limite et a donn\u00e9 une explication le 24 octobre 2022. Le Tribunal a fix\u00e9 une nouvelle date pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, mais une semaine apr\u00e8s le groupe envoyait son \u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb, apr\u00e8s quoi l\u2019optique pour le groupe devenait la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement d\u2019audience du 21 novembre 2022. Je crois que c\u2019est la seule fois dans l\u2019histoire de cette affaire qu\u2019une conf\u00e9rence ait \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e \u00e0 si bref d\u00e9lai.\n[88] Dans ses observations relatives \u00e0 la requ\u00eate pour r\u00e9cusation, le groupe va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 d\u00e9clarer : [traduction] \u00ab Lorsque nous regardons la suite des \u00e9v\u00e9nements et des courriels, il nous para\u00eet possible qu\u2019il y ait eu une communication d\u00e9tourn\u00e9e entre le membre et l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb. Le Tribunal a r\u00e9pondu par \u00e9crit qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de communication ex parte entre l\u2019intim\u00e9 et moi. Le groupe a encore \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] il nous est difficile de ne pas conclure que cette annulation visait davantage \u00e0 \u00e9pargner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019embarras pour son avocate sur son manque de communication au sujet des retards d\u2019information sur les t\u00e9moins \u00bb. C\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 une conclusion \u00e9trange (et fausse) \u00e0 tirer pour le groupe.\n[89] Je remarque que la seule communication ex parte qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 faite l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 par le groupe tout au long de cette instance. Le r\u00e9sultat est que l\u2019agente du greffe a eu \u00e0 plusieurs occasions \u00e0 transmettre la correspondance du groupe aux autres parties. \u00c0 plus d\u2019une occasion, l\u2019intim\u00e9 m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de rappeler au groupe son devoir d\u2019acheminer les communications avec le Tribunal vers les autres parties. Et c\u2019est ce que j\u2019ai r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 en pr\u00e9cisant que la seule exception visait les questions administratives mineures. (Voir, par exemple, la page 2 de la lettre du 24 mars 2016 r\u00e9sumant une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire.)\n[90] Voici un extrait de ce qu\u2019a \u00e9crit le Tribunal aux parties le 26 octobre 2022 : [traduction] \u00ab Le Tribunal fait observer que la demande de prorogation [de Me Marchildon] est intervenue apr\u00e8s que l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 21 octobre 2022 a \u00e9t\u00e9 manqu\u00e9e \u00bb [italique dans l\u2019original]. Le groupe rapproche ce message d\u2019un moment o\u00f9 [traduction] \u00ab [\u2026] le membre a choisi d\u2019admonester M. Goodwin dans sa lettre \u00e0 toutes les parties \u00bb. Il s\u2019agissait de la lettre du 20 juillet 2018 du Tribunal traitant du non-respect par le groupe de l\u2019ordonnance no 3 de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2018 TCDP 20. Cette lettre indiquait notamment que [traduction] \u00ab [l]e groupe Goodwin [des GCRP] n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance du 13 juillet 2018 fix\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision et l\u2019ordonnance du 29 juin 2018. Il va sans dire que toute demande de modification d\u2019une ordonnance en prorogation ou autre devrait se faire avant toute date limite \u00bb. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse de 2018, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas employ\u00e9 l\u2019italique ni le soulignement, comme il l\u2019avait fait dans sa lettre de 2022, \u00e0 l\u2019intention des parties pour l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance manqu\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Je ne peux souscrire \u00e0 l\u2019observation du groupe, selon laquelle [traduction] \u00ab [i]l ressort des actions du membre Garfield dans les deux exemples qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent qu\u2019il existe des r\u00e8gles strictes et rigides qui exigent une r\u00e9ponse publique imm\u00e9diate au plaignant m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019incidence du tout sur les parties et que, dans le cas de l\u2019intim\u00e9, il y a des r\u00e8gles diff\u00e9rentes et plus souples n\u2019exigeant gu\u00e8re de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qu\u2019il produise une r\u00e9ponse publique en d\u00e9pit de tout effet n\u00e9gatif sur les parties \u00bb.\n[91] Le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 la [traduction] \u00ab demande tardive \u00bb de l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sollicitant une prorogation pour d\u00e9poser ses renseignements sur les t\u00e9moins. Le groupe dit \u00e9galement : [traduction] \u00ab En acceptant une demande tardive de prorogation, le membre Garfield fait preuve de favoritisme envers une partie par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019autre, et ce, sans m\u00eame s\u2019enqu\u00e9rir de notre position \u00bb. Il n\u2019y a pas eu de favoritisme ici. Je signale que, tout au long de l\u2019instance, j\u2019ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 plus de demandes de prorogation ou de report pour le groupe que pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce n\u2019est toutefois r\u00e9v\u00e9lateur de rien de n\u00e9gatif, car chaque demande, requ\u00eate, opposition, etc., se tranche selon son bien-fond\u00e9. Si une partie pr\u00e9sente dix demandes ou requ\u00eates valables, les dix devraient \u00eatre accept\u00e9es. Ce n\u2019est pas une question de chiffres. Le juge ou l\u2019arbitre \u00e9value chaque demande sur le fond et au cas par cas.\n[92] J\u2019estime que le principe de renonciation ne s\u2019applique pas ici, car le fait principal (annulation de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 24 octobre 2022) a eu lieu vers la fin d\u2019octobre 2022 et le groupe a donc mis un temps raisonnable \u00e0 soulever la question dans son \u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du 1er novembre et dans ses observations principales pour le document de requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation. Sur le fond, je conclus, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, que l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 4 ne satisfait pas au crit\u00e8re exigeant relatif \u00e0 la crainte de partialit\u00e9.\nE. All\u00e9gation no 5 : demandes de divulgation\n[93] Le groupe all\u00e8gue que j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 la \u00ab grande majorit\u00e9 \u00bb de leurs requ\u00eates et demandes en divulgation de 2014 \u00e0 2018, ce qui d\u00e9note une tendance \u00e0 la partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Un des exemples mis en lumi\u00e8re est celui de la [traduction] \u00ab D\u00e9cision Walden du TCDP, Aper\u00e7u des d\u00e9cisions du TCDP sur les \u00e9valuateurs m\u00e9dicaux et Lignes directrices pour le traitement du r\u00e8glement \u00bb de mai 2013 (les \u00ab Lignes directrices \u00bb). Le groupe avait re\u00e7u ces lignes directrices une fois caviard\u00e9es et d\u00e9pouill\u00e9es de leurs annexes \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et de protection des renseignements personnels (la \u00ab demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00bb), et non par les soins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pendant l\u2019\u00e9tape de divulgation\/production de l\u2019instance. Le groupe a demand\u00e9 le document complet hors de tout caviardage. J\u2019ai acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 sa demande en partie : voir la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate 2018 TCDP 20. (La question des Lignes directrices et du pourquoi de leur non\u2011divulgation par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire en 2017 que r\u00e9sume une lettre dat\u00e9e du 20 octobre de la m\u00eame ann\u00e9e.)\n[94] Le groupe soutient que c\u2019est l\u00e0 l\u2019illustration du parti pris qui \u00e9tait le mien \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation de l\u2019instance. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. Le Tribunal \u00e9crit au paragraphe 12 de la d\u00e9cision 2018 TCDP 20 :\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 invoque l\u2019absence de pertinence potentielle pour justifier la suppression de certains passages et le refus de produire certains documents dans leur int\u00e9grit\u00e9, et il revendique un privil\u00e8ge pour d\u2019autres. D\u2019ailleurs, Me Marchildon se demande m\u00eame si les lignes directrices sont potentiellement pertinentes, mais il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une question th\u00e9orique, compte tenu de ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u00e9j\u00e0 produit dans le cadre de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s. La Commission estime que certains documents et certaines parties d\u2019entre eux sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le secret professionnel de l\u2019avocat et que ce privil\u00e8ge devrait \u00eatre \u00ab jalousement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00bb par le Tribunal. Le groupe Goodwin soutient que les lignes directrices et les annexes sont potentiellement pertinentes et qu\u2019EDSC a renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 toute revendication de privil\u00e8ge en r\u00e9pondant \u00e0 la demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s.\n[95] Dans ladite d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai conclu que les Lignes directrices \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinentes (\u00ab ou, du moins, des parties de celles-ci \u00bb) et, ayant tranch\u00e9 la question du privil\u00e8ge, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir imm\u00e9diatement au groupe les deux courriels non caviard\u00e9s dans la mesure indiqu\u00e9e par la d\u00e9cision, ainsi que l\u2019annexe B non expurg\u00e9e. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 la lev\u00e9e du scell\u00e9 sur l\u2019une des deux lettres en question et demand\u00e9 que copie de ce document et la lettre d\u2019accompagnement soient remises au groupe par le greffe du Tribunal.\n[96] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 les lettres r\u00e9sumant les conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires et le reste de la correspondance du Tribunal, ainsi que les d\u00e9cisions avec motifs qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 produites au sujet d\u2019un grand nombre de requ\u00eates en divulgation faites par le groupe de 2014 \u00e0 2018. Il est vrai que la majorit\u00e9 de ces requ\u00eates et demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9es. Chacune a \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e selon son bien-fond\u00e9 et des motifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (de vive voix et par \u00e9crit) dans tous les cas. Le groupe va encore plus loin : [traduction] \u00ab Nous soutenons que cette requ\u00eate pourrait avoir trouv\u00e9 sa solution il y a des ann\u00e9es si un plus grand nombre de nos demandes de divulgation avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 appuy\u00e9es par le membre \u00bb. Cette affirmation est, bien s\u00fbr, hautement hypoth\u00e9tique, mais on se trouve \u00e0 passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de la question. Le groupe a eu gain de cause ou non dans ses requ\u00eates en divulgation (et autres) selon le bien-fond\u00e9 de chaque demande.\n[97] Sur la question de la renonciation, je juge que le principe de l\u2019abandon s\u2019applique ici. Voici ce qu\u2019\u00e9crit le groupe dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique : [traduction] \u00ab Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 [au sujet des demandes de divulgation refus\u00e9es de 2014 \u00e0 2018], peu apr\u00e8s que ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, l\u2019AFPC nous a assign\u00e9 un avocat, et celui\u2011ci n\u2019a pas voulu aller plus loin avec nos pr\u00e9occupations, pr\u00e9f\u00e9rant s\u2019attacher \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 venir comme cible \u00bb. Le groupe ne mentionne pas les dates auxquelles il a discut\u00e9 de ces questions ou pr\u00e9occupations de partialit\u00e9 avec son avocat, mais le dossier du Tribunal indique que Me Yoboua a repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le groupe de septembre 2016 \u00e0 mai 2017.\n[98] Dans la citation qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le groupe pr\u00e9cise \u00ab peu apr\u00e8s que ces questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal \u00bb, mais j\u2019ignore ce qu\u2019il entend par l\u00e0. Mon examen du dossier et mes notes ne montrent pas que le groupe ait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 quelque d\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 du Tribunal avant le courriel de \u00ab d\u00e9mission \u00bb de M. Goodwin du 22 septembre 2021. Une recherche informatique sur les mots \u00ab partialit\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00ab conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb r\u00e9v\u00e8le que c\u2019est M. Goodwin qui en a fait mention pour la premi\u00e8re fois, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la repr\u00e9sentante du client et d\u2019un t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en 2016, comme en fait \u00e9tat la lettre du 24 mars 2016 r\u00e9sumant cette conf\u00e9rence. La premi\u00e8re occurrence du mot \u00ab partialit\u00e9 \u00bb invoqu\u00e9 contre le Tribunal figure dans la lettre du 4 octobre 2021 de ce dernier en r\u00e9ponse au courriel de \u00ab d\u00e9mission \u00bb du 22 septembre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent o\u00f9 M. Goodwin soulevait la question d\u2019une partialit\u00e9 de fait. Une recherche informatis\u00e9e sur les termes \u00ab partialit\u00e9 \u00bb et \u00ab conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00bb montre que ces termes ont d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 express\u00e9ment employ\u00e9s par le groupe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Tribunal dans son \u00ab Appel \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente \u00bb du 1er novembre 2022.\n[99] Je me range \u00e0 l\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour qui le principe de la renonciation s\u2019applique ici. Le groupe a discut\u00e9 de ses [traduction] \u00ab pr\u00e9occupations \u00bb avec son avocat en 2016 et 2017. Par ce m\u00eame avocat, il aurait d\u00fb avoir soulev\u00e9 la question de la partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment\u2011l\u00e0 devant le Tribunal et avoir produit une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation. \u00c0 titre subsidiaire et sur le fond, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, je conclus que le groupe n\u2019a pas satisfait au crit\u00e8re exigeant relatif \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une crainte de partialit\u00e9.\nF. All\u00e9gation no 6 : intim\u00e9 non responsable de la retenue de documents pertinents; documentation pertinente incompl\u00e8te fournie par le Tribunal\n[100] Cette all\u00e9gation semble reposer sur le fait que le Tribunal n\u2019ait pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme responsable de la retenue de documents pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la divulgation, tout comme sur le fait que le Tribunal n\u2019ait pas fourni une documentation compl\u00e8te. Le groupe s\u2019attache aux Lignes directrices de l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 5 plus haut, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits dans le dossier de l\u2019autre requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles de la GCRP retrait\u00e9e.\n[101] Quant aux Lignes directrices, j\u2019en parle \u00e0 propos de l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 5. J\u2019ai effectivement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire pourquoi elles n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9es. J\u2019ai tranch\u00e9 la question dans ma d\u00e9cision 2018 TCDP 20 en concluant que le document \u00e9tait potentiellement pertinent (dans certaines de ses parties) et en demandant qu\u2019il soit produit en partie. En ce qui concerne la \u00ab responsabilit\u00e9 \u00bb, il \u00e9tait loisible au groupe de contre-interroger l\u00e0\u2011dessus les t\u00e9moins d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat d\u2019EDSC \u00e0 l\u2019audience, tout comme de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments dans ses observations finales en demandant notamment au Tribunal de tirer des conclusions d\u00e9favorables \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[102] Pour ce qui est des deux expos\u00e9s conjoints des faits, il y avait eu correspondance entre l\u2019agente du greffe, M. Brenton et Me Marchildon au sujet d\u2019un ou de plusieurs expos\u00e9s dans l\u2019autre dossier de la GCRP retrait\u00e9e pour tenter de clarifier et de r\u00e9soudre le probl\u00e8me. Je crois savoir que le Tribunal n\u2019a re\u00e7u qu\u2019une \u00e9bauche sans signature d\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits le 4 juin 2021. \u00c0 la question de savoir pourquoi cet expos\u00e9 ne figurait pas dans le fichier PDF des principaux documents, la r\u00e9ponse est que seule la table des mati\u00e8res du cahier de preuve documentaire conjoint (pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es) du dossier de l\u2019autre requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles de la GCRP retrait\u00e9e avait \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse. Mes notes indiquent que l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits figurait sur la liste pour la confirmation d\u2019une solution trouv\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique du 24 octobre 2022, laquelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e et report\u00e9e. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9, cette question et les autres questions finales de gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience du 21 novembre 2022 n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 discut\u00e9es, car le groupe avait choisi le 1er novembre pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent de s\u2019engager sur l\u2019autre voie d\u2019une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement.\n[103] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9, la pratique voulait que le repr\u00e9sentant qui quitte ses fonctions transmette le dossier complet \u00e0 son successeur. (Et M. Goodwin et Mme Ladouceur \u00e9taient l\u00e0, avec les autres membres du groupe, pour seconder M. Brenton.) Il reste que, pour aider ce dernier, nous avons cr\u00e9\u00e9 un fichier PDF des principaux documents qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 remis \u00e0 toutes les parties. Toutefois, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dit \u00e0 M. Brenton qu\u2019il lui incombait de communiquer avec l\u2019agente du greffe pour obtenir tout document n\u00e9cessaire (dans le dossier du groupe et celui de l\u2019autre GCRP retrait\u00e9e) ou de prendre ses dispositions pour parcourir la teneur des dossiers. L\u2019agente du greffe a \u00e9t\u00e9 fort serviable et, tout au long du mandat de repr\u00e9sentation de M. Brenton, elle est rest\u00e9e en contact avec lui au t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et par voie \u00e9lectronique. M. Brenton a fait plusieurs demandes de documents et a re\u00e7u cette documentation. Que ces efforts importants \u2013 voire exceptionnels \u2013 n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaits n\u2019autorise gu\u00e8re \u00e0 conclure que le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 partial.\n[104] Sur la question de la renonciation, je porte le m\u00eame jugement d\u2019applicabilit\u00e9 quant aux Lignes directrices (dans l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 5 plus haut). Et sur le fond, j\u2019affirme qu\u2019aucun des cas \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s par le groupe dans l\u2019all\u00e9gation no 6, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse des Lignes directrices, des expos\u00e9s conjoints des faits, du fichier PDF des principaux documents ou d\u2019autre chose, n\u2019autorise de quelque mani\u00e8re une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\nG. All\u00e9gation no 7 : refus de tenir une audience sur pi\u00e8ces\n[105] Ce qui est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ici, c\u2019est que mon refus de la demande faite par le groupe en vue d\u2019une instruction par \u00e9crit de sa requ\u00eate plut\u00f4t que par la tenue d\u2019une audience suscite une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9.\n[106] La question a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et tranch\u00e9e par moi dans la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 d\u00e9cembre 2014, o\u00f9 le groupe \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat. J\u2019ai entendu les observations des parties. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019opposait \u00e0 la demande, ne d\u00e9sirant pas renoncer \u00e0 son droit de contre-interroger. La Commission n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation sur la forme de l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate. Au re\u00e7u des observations, j\u2019ai opt\u00e9 pour une audience sur la requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles et j\u2019ai expos\u00e9 mes motifs de vive voix avant de les mettre par \u00e9crit dans la lettre r\u00e9sumant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique en question. Je devais tirer des conclusions de fait et de droit, notamment en ce qui concerne les faits contest\u00e9s. La fiabilit\u00e9 de la preuve militait de m\u00eame en faveur d\u2019une audience.\n[107] Je remarque que la question a \u00e9t\u00e9 reprise pendant l\u2019instance et j\u2019ai invariablement indiqu\u00e9 ne pas \u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 retirer \u00e0 une partie son droit de contre-interroger pour ce qui est des t\u00e9moignages sur les faits et des nombreuses pi\u00e8ces susceptibles d\u2019\u00eatre produites. (En novembre 2022, l\u2019\u00e9bauche du cahier de preuve documentaire conjoint comptait moins de 300 pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es.)\n[108] Si le groupe a toujours voulu une instruction de la requ\u00eate sur pi\u00e8ces, tel n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas pour l\u2019intim\u00e9. J\u2019ai effectivement rappel\u00e9 aux parties \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que j\u2019\u00e9tais dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 examiner les moyens permettant de simplifier et d\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le processus d\u2019audience, et autoriser notamment les d\u00e9clarations tenant lieu d\u2019interrogatoire principal. Ayant pr\u00e9sid\u00e9 l\u2019audience pour la seule instruction d\u2019une requ\u00eate sur fonctions admissibles qui ait eu lieu, l\u2019instance McIlroy (2015 TCDP 15), je voyais l\u2019avantage d\u2019une audience avec contre-interrogatoire. L\u2019audience en question avait compt\u00e9 moins de t\u00e9moins et de documents que n\u2019en aurait l\u2019instruction de la requ\u00eate du groupe. Cela dit, si l\u2019intim\u00e9 et donc toutes les parties avaient renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur droit de contre-interroger et s\u2019\u00e9taient entendus sur la tenue d\u2019une audience sur pi\u00e8ces, j\u2019y aurais consenti.\n[109] J\u2019estime que le principe de la renonciation volontaire s\u2019applique ici. Si le groupe a jug\u00e9 que mon refus de sa demande visant la tenue d\u2019une audience sur pi\u00e8ces suscitait une crainte de partialit\u00e9, il \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de d\u00e9cembre 2014 o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, et il disposait aussi d\u2019un avocat de l\u2019AFPC en 2016 et 2017. \u00c0 partir de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de d\u00e9cembre 2014 et tout le temps que le groupe a \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par un avocat en 2016 et 2017, une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation pour crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 aurait pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Subsidiairement et sur le fond, je conclus, compte tenu des observations qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, qu\u2019aucun indice de partialit\u00e9 ne justifie que je me r\u00e9cuse.\nH. All\u00e9gation no 8: apparence de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats\n[110] Le groupe soutient qu\u2019il y a perception ou apparence (et non-constatation r\u00e9elle ou effective) de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats concernant mon travail au Tribunal. Ce qui est notamment vis\u00e9, c\u2019est ma d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles du groupe et le contrat de mon entreprise avec le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, ces deux activit\u00e9s comportant des jugements \u00e0 titre d\u2019arbitre ind\u00e9pendant et de tiers neutre.\n[111] Le groupe dit avoir pris conscience d\u2019un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats apparent [traduction] \u00ab dans les premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es \u00bb de sa requ\u00eate, soit en 2016. Il n\u2019avait pas soulev\u00e9 la question aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal [traduction] \u00ab par crainte de repr\u00e9sailles s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pris au s\u00e9rieux \u00bb. Le groupe a bel et bien soulev\u00e9 la question aupr\u00e8s de son avocat d\u2019alors : [traduction] \u00ab Plus tard en 2016, l\u2019AFPC [Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada] a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de nous repr\u00e9senter dans notre requ\u00eate au TCDP. Nous avons remis \u00e0 notre avocat de l\u2019AFPC copie des renseignements sur les march\u00e9s f\u00e9d\u00e9raux de l\u2019entreprise du membre Garfield \u00e0 partir du site Web de TPSGC [Travaux publics et Services gouvernementaux Canada]. L\u2019avocat n\u2019a pas voulu aller de l\u2019avant avec ces renseignements \u00bb.\n[112] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats, r\u00e9el ou apparent, dans mon travail d\u00e9cisionnel :\n[TRADUCTION]\nPour \u00e9valuer s\u2019il existe un conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats possible qui autorise une crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9, les tribunaux ont tenu compte du contexte particulier pour la nature du travail auquel quelqu\u2019un est associ\u00e9, tout comme du r\u00f4le qu\u2019il peut jouer comme d\u00e9cideur. [deux affaires cit\u00e9es] Les membres du Tribunal travaillent souvent dans d\u2019autres entreprises ou lieux de travail et continuent en m\u00eame temps \u00e0 exercer leurs fonctions de d\u00e9cideurs administratifs.\n[\u2026]\nDans la requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles dont est saisi le Tribunal, on recherche une indemnisation d\u2019EDSC. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une entit\u00e9 tout \u00e0 fait distincte du minist\u00e8re d\u00e9sign\u00e9 par le groupe [\u2026] Les fonctions du membre du Tribunal comme arbitre des plaintes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sont suffisamment \u00e9loign\u00e9es de tout travail qui pourrait \u00eatre le sien du fait de son emploi dans le secteur priv\u00e9.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement valoir que le principe de la renonciation s\u2019applique ici.\n[113] Le contrat dont il est question a \u00e9t\u00e9 pass\u00e9 par mon entreprise de r\u00e8glement extra-judiciaire des diff\u00e9rends et le minist\u00e8re f\u00e9d\u00e9ral alors appel\u00e9 Affaires autochtones et D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (\u00ab AADNC \u00bb) avec son Bureau de l\u2019adjudicateur en chef. Je compte parmi les nombreuses personnes ayant eu le privil\u00e8ge d\u2019\u00eatre choisies dans le cadre du Processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendant (le \u00ab PEI \u00bb) comme \u00ab adjudicateurs \u00bb des r\u00e9clamations pour s\u00e9vices physiques, sexuels ou psychologiques subis par d\u2019anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves des Premi\u00e8res Nations dans les pensionnats indiens.\n[114] Le PEI \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9 par un adjudicateur en chef ind\u00e9pendant. Il y avait des adjudicateurs en chef adjoints et plus d\u2019une centaine d\u2019adjudicateurs \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle du Canada. Le syst\u00e8me du PEI comprenait un organe administratif\/op\u00e9rationnel, \u00e0 savoir le Secr\u00e9tariat d\u2019adjudication des pensionnats indiens. Pour l\u2019essentiel, le mod\u00e8le du PEI rappelait un tribunal administratif sp\u00e9cial comme le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, sauf que ce dernier est permanent et fond\u00e9 sur le syst\u00e8me accusatoire de common law, alors que le PEI relevait plus d\u2019un mod\u00e8le inquisitorial d\u2019arbitrage de demandes, ax\u00e9 davantage sur les demandeurs. Chaque mod\u00e8le comprend des arbitres et une instance administrative\/op\u00e9rationnelle et chacun est ind\u00e9pendant des parties qu\u2019il fait compara\u00eetre, dont le gouvernement du Canada.\n[115] Je conclus que le principe de la renonciation s\u2019applique ici. Le groupe a appris que mon entreprise avait un contrat avec le gouvernement et en a inform\u00e9 son avocat en 2016. Celui\u2011ci a conseill\u00e9 de ne pas donner suite et le groupe a accept\u00e9 son avis. Il aurait pu lui donner instruction de soulever la question et, s\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait de la r\u00e9ponse du Tribunal, de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation. Le groupe a attendu six ans pour agir. Au plus tard, il aurait d\u00fb produire une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation apr\u00e8s la lettre du 4 octobre 2021 dans laquelle le Tribunal traitait, de fait, des accusations de partialit\u00e9 formul\u00e9es par M. Goodwin et lui notifiait la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre et les contraintes de temps pour de telles all\u00e9gations.\n[116] Subsidiairement, je conclus sur le fond qu\u2019il ne peut \u00eatre question de perception de conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats ni de crainte raisonnable de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 propos de mon travail de 2011 \u00e0 2018 \u00e0 titre d\u2019adjudicateur ind\u00e9pendant du PEI, du contrat de mon entreprise avec un minist\u00e8re diff\u00e9rent et de ma t\u00e2che \u00e0 titre de membre \u00e0 temps partiel du Tribunal, notamment dans le cas de la requ\u00eate du groupe pour fonctions admissibles. Une personne raisonnablement inform\u00e9e conclurait que mon travail dans le cadre du PEI \u00e9tait ind\u00e9pendant de mon travail au Tribunal et vice versa. Pour la plupart, les membres \u00e0 temps partiel du Tribunal et d\u2019autres cours ont comme moi d\u2019autres emplois ou t\u00e2ches, notamment dans la pratique du droit. Le gouvernement du Canada est une entit\u00e9 \u00e9norme o\u00f9 abondent les minist\u00e8res et les organismes. Je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas un employ\u00e9 d\u2019AADNC et je ne repr\u00e9sentais pas ce minist\u00e8re ni le gouvernement dans mon r\u00f4le d\u2019adjudicateur au PEI. De m\u00eame, en ma qualit\u00e9 de membre \u00e0 temps partiel du Tribunal, je suis nomm\u00e9 en toute ind\u00e9pendance par le gouverneur en conseil sur la recommandation du ministre de la Justice et procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada.\n[117] Ce sont deux r\u00f4les d\u2019arbitre ind\u00e9pendant et de tiers neutre. Ils exigent l\u2019un et l\u2019autre de l\u2019impartialit\u00e9, de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la neutralit\u00e9, dans les faits comme en apparence. En fait, la d\u00e9marche rigoureuse de s\u00e9lection des adjudicateurs du PEI imposait notamment une approbation unanime de chaque candidat par des comit\u00e9s de s\u00e9lection o\u00f9 \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s toutes les parties et les intervenants dans le cadre de l\u2019historique Convention de r\u00e8glement relative aux pensionnats indiens.\n[118] Dans une de ses observations, le groupe dit que ma conduite d\u00e9montre une nette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour les minist\u00e8res et les gestionnaires du gouvernement. Ironiquement, environ 90 % de mes d\u00e9cisions au PEI ont consist\u00e9 \u00e0 approuver les r\u00e9clamations d\u2019anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves des pensionnats contre le Canada. (Cela concorde avec la situation des autres adjudicateurs, puisque \u00ab [p]armi les demandeurs qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus lors d\u2019une audience ou (dans le cadre du processus de r\u00e8glement n\u00e9goci\u00e9) d\u2019un entretien, 90 % obtinrent une indemnisation \u00bb : voir \u00ab Processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendant (PEI) \u2013 Sommaire du rapport final, Comit\u00e9 de surveillance du Processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation ind\u00e9pendant, 2021, p. 22). Bien entendu, on ne saurait pour autant y voir une crainte de partialit\u00e9 en faveur des anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves et contre le Canada, car chaque affaire relevant du PEI, comme chaque affaire devant le Tribunal comme la pr\u00e9sente instance, se tranche au cas par cas apr\u00e8s prise en compte de la preuve et des arguments juridiques.\n[119] Je me dois aussi de dire que le contrat de mon entreprise relatif au PEI et mon travail d\u2019adjudicateur \u00e9taient publiquement connus. Il n\u2019y avait aucun secret. Le contrat pass\u00e9 avec TPSGC a \u00e9t\u00e9 diffus\u00e9 en ligne (c\u2019est de cette fa\u00e7on que le groupe a eu connaissance de mon travail dans le cadre du PEI), comme l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 ma biographie avec la mention de mon r\u00f4le au PEI dans les rapports annuels du Tribunal (qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au Parlement) et au site Web de celui\u2011ci \u00e0 la section des membres.\nX. Conclusion\n[120] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate du groupe en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement le 24 novembre 2022. Le lendemain, le groupe retirait sa requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles, apr\u00e8s quoi j\u2019ajournais l\u2019audience devant d\u00e9buter le lundi 28 novembre suivant. Je tiens \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre le travail consenti par le groupe et ses divers repr\u00e9sentants tout au long de l\u2019instance pour fonctions admissibles; il y a eu l\u00e0 sans aucun doute beaucoup de temps, d\u2019\u00e9nergie et de stress. J\u2019en dirais autant du travail de l\u2019avocate et de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[121] Je l\u2019indique bien dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate : \u00ab sans \u00bb ma d\u00e9cision du 20 octobre 2022 par laquelle j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la demande faite par le groupe de passer en mode hybride (audience en personne et par Zoom) \u00e0 St. John\u2019s, il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable que le processus se serait d\u00e9roul\u00e9 fort diff\u00e9remment. Au lieu de nous engager dans la voie de la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation et ajournement, nous aurions tenu l\u2019audience \u00e0 St. John\u2019s, et une d\u00e9cision (favorable ou non) sur le fond aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue sur la requ\u00eate pour fonctions admissibles du groupe.

En 2008, Geevarughese Johnson Itty a pos\u00e9 sa candidature au poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers. M. Itty est originaire de l\u2019Inde et vivait au Canada depuis 20 ans au moment de poser sa candidature.\nIl a r\u00e9ussi l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection et a \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer au programme de formation \u00e0 Rigaud (Qu\u00e9bec). Les recrues sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es tout au long du programme. Si les \u00e9valuateurs estiment qu\u2019une recrue ne remplit pas les crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9valuation, celle-ci devra se retirer du programme. M. Itty n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi une s\u00e9rie d\u2019exercices de simulation. Il a donc d\u00fb retourner chez lui et ne s\u2019est pas vu offrir le poste d\u2019agent des services frontaliers.\nSelon la plainte de M. Itty, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de sa race, de sa couleur et de son origine nationale ou ethnique. Il a donn\u00e9 au Tribunal de nombreux exemples de choses n\u00e9gatives qui se sont produites au cours du programme et qui, selon lui, \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 son accent, \u00e0 sa couleur de peau ou \u00e0 ses origines. M. Itty et l\u2019Agence ont fait appel \u00e0 des experts, qui ont expliqu\u00e9 comment l\u2019Agence avait \u00e9valu\u00e9 M. Itty et les autres recrues. L\u2019Agence a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ont d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les personnes ayant les m\u00eames origines que M. Itty \u00e9taient surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans les postes frontaliers de la r\u00e9gion du Grand Toronto, o\u00f9 il aurait travaill\u00e9. Le Tribunal a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et a conclu que les exp\u00e9riences n\u00e9gatives v\u00e9cues par M. Itty n\u2019\u00e9taient pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 ses caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es.\nDe plus, M. Itty a soulev\u00e9 la question importante de la destruction de preuves. Il n\u2019a pas pu pr\u00e9senter les dossiers de ses coll\u00e8gues qui avaient r\u00e9ussi le programme, car l\u2019Agence les avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9truits. Cette question \u00e9tait importante, parce que M. Itty estimait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 plus s\u00e9v\u00e8rement. Selon lui, l\u2019Agence avait agi ainsi de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e afin de nuire \u00e0 ses chances dans le cadre de cette plainte. L\u2019Agence a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir agi comme elle l\u2019aurait fait pour tout autre dossier. Le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019Agence aurait d\u00fb disposer de meilleures politiques et d\u2019une meilleure coordination lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait question de dossiers et de plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne. Cependant, la conduite de l\u2019Agence ne r\u00e9pond pas au crit\u00e8re juridique de la destruction de preuves.\nCette affaire renferme des renseignements tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licats provenant de l\u2019Agence. Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que ces renseignements devaient demeurer confidentiels, donc certains des d\u00e9tails qui ont appuy\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nIl n'y a pas de document disponible pour cette d\u00e9cision.",

ORDONNANCE 6\nI. APER\u00c7U [1] La plaignante demande une ordonnance rendant anonyme la pr\u00e9sente instance. Dans sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, elle d\u00e9clare \u00eatre une femme transgenre autochtone d\u00e9tenue par le Service correctionnel du Canada (l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb). Elle all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9e use d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux soins d\u2019affirmation du genre pour les prisonniers de genre mixte et, en particulier, qu\u2019un psychiatre judiciaire engag\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 sa situation \u00e0 sa famille et \u00e0 sa communaut\u00e9 d\u2019origine sans son consentement.\n[2] Elle soutient qu\u2019il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux que la divulgation de son identit\u00e9 dans le cadre des instances du Tribunal lui cause une contrainte excessive, ce qui porterait atteinte \u00e0 son droit \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9, droit que le grand public a int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne consent \u00e0 la demande. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a, quant \u00e0 lui, pas pris position.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je ferai droit \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ordonnance.\nIII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [5] Je dois trancher les questions suivantes :\nExiste-t-il un risque s\u00e9rieux que la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante lui cause une contrainte excessive, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important? N\u2019existe-t-il pas d\u2019autres mesures qui permettraient d\u2019\u00e9viter le risque s\u00e9rieux de pr\u00e9judice pour la plaignante tout en pr\u00e9servant les valeurs qui sous-tendent le principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires? Les risques s\u00e9rieux de pr\u00e9judice l\u2019emportent-ils sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante?\n[6] Le pouvoir du Tribunal de rendre des ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb). Cet article pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction d\u2019une affaire devant le Tribunal est publique, ce qui consacre le principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada au paragraphe 1 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession) c. Donovan, 2021 CSC 25 (CanLII), le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le droit constitutionnel \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et, \u00e0 ce titre, repr\u00e9sente un \u00e9l\u00e9ment fondamental d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie lib\u00e9rale.\n[7] Cependant, la Cour supr\u00eame a \u00e9galement reconnu qu\u2019il existe des circonstances exceptionnelles dans lesquelles des int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s justifient de restreindre le principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires (Sherman (Succession), au par. 3). Dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, ce principe est consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la LCDP, qui pr\u00e9voit que les membres du Tribunal peuvent prendre des mesures et rendre des ordonnances pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019ils sont convaincus qu\u2019il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des personnes concern\u00e9es ou dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique.\n[8] L\u2019analyse l\u00e9gislative pour ce type de demande d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 s\u2019appuie sur le crit\u00e8re en trois volets \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession), qui est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement compatible avec le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la LCDP (A.B. c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2022 TCDP 15, aux par. 14 et 15). La Cour supr\u00eame a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 au paragraphe 38 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession) que la personne qui demande \u00e0 une cour de justice ou \u00e0 un tribunal d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 limiter la pr\u00e9somption de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires doit \u00e9tablir que :\nla publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important; l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter ce risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence, car d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque; du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n[9] La Cour supr\u00eame a relev\u00e9 qu'un int\u00e9r\u00eat en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e peut refl\u00e9ter un int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 (au paragraphe 48). Toutefois, il convient d'\u00eatre prudent dans l'application de ce concept. Les instances judiciaires publiques, de par leur nature, peuvent \u00eatre une source de d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ment et d\u2019embarras, et l\u2019on consid\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement que ces atteintes \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e ne sont pas suffisamment importantes pour r\u00e9futer la pr\u00e9somption de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires (au paragraphe 56). Il doit \u00eatre d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la diffusion d'informations tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licates porterait atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la personne concern\u00e9e (aux paragraphes 33 \u00e0 35)\n[10] Par cons\u00e9quent, l'alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la LCDP, \u00e9clair\u00e9 par l'analyse de la Cour supr\u00eame dans l'arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession), expose les questions que je dois aborder dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nIV. ANALYSE A. Question 1. Il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux que la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante lui cause une contrainte excessive, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important? [11] Je suis d\u2019avis qu'il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux que la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation de l'identit\u00e9 de la plaignante lui cause une contrainte excessive, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.\n[12] La plaignante d\u00e9clare dans sa requ\u00eate qu'en tant que femme transgenre autochtone, elle est vis\u00e9e par des formes exceptionnelles et extr\u00eames de stigmatisation publique. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 orient\u00e9e vers une chirurgie d'affirmation du genre et esp\u00e8re avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de vivre selon le genre de son choix apr\u00e8s sa remise en libert\u00e9, sans \u00eatre imm\u00e9diatement identifiable \u00e0 titre de transgenre sur Internet. Elle ajoute que, si son identit\u00e9 n'est pas rendue anonyme dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance, cela aura pour effet de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler sa situation \u00e0 perp\u00e9tuit\u00e9, rendant ainsi son identit\u00e9 \u00e0 titre de transgenre ainsi que des d\u00e9tails intimes sur son histoire personnelle et sa sant\u00e9 mentale accessibles \u00e0 tout le monde et \u00e0 tout moment. La plaignante a joint une copie du rapport du psychiatre, rapport qui constitue le fondement de sa plainte. Ce rapport d\u00e9taille ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 mentale ainsi que d'autres questions personnelles. La plaignante note \u00e9galement que son anonymat a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale, qui a fait l'objet d'une interdiction de publication.\n[13] Comme l'a soulign\u00e9 le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision A.B, aux par. 41 et 42, l'identit\u00e9 transgenre est encore \u00ab fortement stigmatis\u00e9e dans notre soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb. Les d\u00e9savantages, la discrimination ainsi que la stigmatisation et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s extr\u00eames constants que subissent les personnes transgenres sont bien connus. La plaignante souligne qu'elle se trouve dans une situation encore plus vuln\u00e9rable en raison de facteurs intersectionnels, du fait qu\u2019elle est une personne transgenre autochtone d\u00e9tenue dans un \u00e9tablissement p\u00e9nitentiaire.\n[14] Je juge que, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas de la plaignante transgenre dans l'affaire A.B., l'identit\u00e9 transgenre de la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce fait partie des int\u00e9r\u00eats prot\u00e9g\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e relev\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession). Il s'agit d'une information si d\u00e9licate que sa diffusion pourrait porter atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la plaignante. Elle serait expos\u00e9e \u00e0 un risque s\u00e9rieux de subir une contrainte excessive bien sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle du simple embarras ou du d\u00e9sagr\u00e9ment. Il s'agirait d'une atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9.\nB. Question 2. L\u2019ordonnance rendant anonyme la pr\u00e9sente instance est n\u00e9cessaire. Il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019autres mesures qui permettraient d\u2019\u00e9viter le risque s\u00e9rieux de pr\u00e9judice pour la plaignante tout en pr\u00e9servant les valeurs qui sous-tendent le principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires [15] La plaignante a \u00e9tabli qu'il n'existe aucune mesure autre qu'une ordonnance rendant anonyme la pr\u00e9sente instance qui serait suffisante pour prot\u00e9ger sa dignit\u00e9 personnelle et ses int\u00e9r\u00eats en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e en ce qui concerne son identit\u00e9 de genre.\n[16] La plainte est centr\u00e9e sur le rapport du psychiatre. Le fond de ce rapport ne peut \u00eatre caviard\u00e9 sans nuire \u00e0 la transparence et \u00e0 l'intelligibilit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision qui sera ultimement rendue par le Tribunal. Une interdiction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de publication, ou m\u00eame un caviardage limit\u00e9 restreint aux d\u00e9tails de fond les plus intimes concernant le sexe, la sant\u00e9 mentale ou les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents personnels de la plaignante, compromettrait consid\u00e9rablement la capacit\u00e9 du public \u00e0 comprendre l'affaire et la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. La seule option raisonnable est de caviarder le nom de la plaignante et les renseignements permettant de l'identifier dans le rapport et dans les autres documents afin de prot\u00e9ger son anonymat dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[17] Comme le fait valoir \u00e0 juste titre la plaignante, les modalit\u00e9s de l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e ne compromettront pas la capacit\u00e9 du public \u00e0 comprendre les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ou le fondement de la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Tous les faits sous\u2011jacents feront partie du dossier et pourront \u00eatre inclus dans la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal, \u00e0 l'exception des d\u00e9tails limit\u00e9s qui permettent d\u2019identifier pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la plaignante. Les valeurs qui sous\u2011tendent le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires seraient ainsi pr\u00e9serv\u00e9es.\nC. Question 3. Les risques importants de pr\u00e9judice l\u2019emportent sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 conna\u00eetre l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante; les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance pr\u00e9valent sur tout pr\u00e9judice [18] Les risques de pr\u00e9judice pour la plaignante l'emportent sur l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 conna\u00eetre son identit\u00e9. En fait, il existe un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important \u00e0 sauvegarder sa dignit\u00e9 et celle d'autres plaignants transgenres potentiels qui pourraient se trouver dans une situation similaire \u00e0 la sienne. L'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son identit\u00e9 est limit\u00e9, d'autant plus que la proc\u00e9dure p\u00e9nale dont elle fait l'objet a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue anonyme jusqu\u2019\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\n[19] Comme le souligne \u00e0 juste titre la plaignante, l'ordonnance demand\u00e9e \u00e9tablit un \u00e9quilibre parfait en ne retirant de la vue du public que les renseignements permettant de l'identifier (c'est-\u00e0-dire son identit\u00e9 sexuelle, ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents personnels, m\u00e9dicaux et de sant\u00e9 mentale, ainsi que le ton et les conclusions du rapport du psychiatre), tout en ne modifiant en rien les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les renseignements susceptibles d'\u00eatre r\u00e9ellement pertinents pour la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal. Cette d\u00e9marche respecte les valeurs fondamentales qui sous-tendent le principe de publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires tout en pr\u00e9servant l'int\u00e9r\u00eat du public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la dignit\u00e9 humaine des plaignants transgenres. Les avantages d'une telle ordonnance l'emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n[20] Je conclus donc que les trois volets du crit\u00e8re ont \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9s et que, conform\u00e9ment au pouvoir du Tribunal pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP, une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-dessous.\nV. ORDONNANCE [21] Le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nLa plaignante doit \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e par le nom E.F. tout au long de l\u2019instance, y compris dans les requ\u00eates, les observations (\u00e9crites et orales), les audiences, les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate et les d\u00e9cisions, et dans tout autre document vers\u00e9 au dossier officiel du Tribunal concernant la pr\u00e9sente instance; Les informations d'identification de la plaignante, y compris son nom pr\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9, son ancien nom (c'est-\u00e0-dire le nom donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance), les noms des membres de sa famille et sa date de naissance (collectivement appel\u00e9s les \u00ab informations d\u2019identification \u00bb), resteront confidentielles tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure, y compris dans les requ\u00eates, les observations (\u00e9crites et orales), les audiences, les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate et les d\u00e9cisions, et tout autre document vers\u00e9 au dossier officiel du Tribunal concernant la pr\u00e9sente instance; Les informations d'identification de la plaignante ne seront divulgu\u00e9es \u00e0 personne, \u00e0 l'exception du Tribunal, du personnel du secr\u00e9tariat du Tribunal, des membres des \u00e9quipes du contentieux des parties, de leurs clients dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire ainsi que des t\u00e9moins et t\u00e9moins potentiels; Le greffe est charg\u00e9 de relever toutes les informations d'identification vers\u00e9es dans les dossiers officiels de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Ces informations doivent \u00eatre caviard\u00e9es dans tous les documents vis\u00e9s par une demande d'acc\u00e8s du public; Les parties proc\u00e9deront au caviardage appropri\u00e9 avant de d\u00e9poser des documents aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios Hadjis\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 3 avril 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : HR-DP-2856-22\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nE.F. c.

ORDONNANCE 8\nI. APER\u00c7U [1] Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2023, Air Canada a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le Tribunal) par laquelle elle demande, entre autres, 1) que les all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite du \u00ab sexe \u00bb soient radi\u00e9es de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante et 2) que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les all\u00e9gations de discrimination soit limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tend de 2014 \u00e0 2018.\n[2] Le 17 mars 2023, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la Commission) a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses arguments en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019Air Canada et a fait valoir que la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe s\u2019inscrivait \u00e0 juste titre dans le cadre de la plainte. Elle a toutefois pass\u00e9 sous silence la question de la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les all\u00e9gations de discrimination.\n[3] Mme Sabrina Rizzo (la plaignante) n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments \u00e9crits en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019Air Canada ou aux arguments de la Commission.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [4] Le Tribunal accueille en partie la requ\u00eate d\u2019Air Canada et d\u00e9clare 1) que le \u00ab sexe \u00bb n\u2019est pas un motif de distinction inclus dans la plainte; 2) que les paragraphes 7 et 10 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Rizzo ne doivent pas \u00eatre radi\u00e9s; 3) que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par les all\u00e9gations de discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tend de 2014 \u00e0 2018.\nIII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [5] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate porte sur deux questions en litige :\nA)Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte?\nB)Si oui, les limites demand\u00e9es par Air Canada sont-elles justifi\u00e9es?\nIV. Analyse A. Le Tribunal a-t-il comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte? [6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[7] La Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb ou la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), conf\u00e8re au membre du Tribunal charg\u00e9 d\u2019instruire la plainte le pouvoir de trancher les questions de droit et les questions de fait dans les affaires dont il est saisi (LCDP, au par. 50(2)). Le membre doit donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations (LCDP, au par. 50(1)).\n[8] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad (Prassad c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), 1989 CanLII 131 (CSC), [1989] 1 RCS 560), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux administratifs sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme \u00ab ma\u00eetres chez eux \u00bb. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : \u00ab En l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement, ils fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la condition de respecter les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et, dans l\u2019exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle \u00bb.\n[9] La jurisprudence \u00e9tablit que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour modifier, clarifier ou d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte de discrimination initiale (Casler c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2017 TCDP 6, aux par. 7 \u00e0 11) [Casler], pourvu que les autres parties ne subissent aucun pr\u00e9judice (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776, aux par. 30 et 31 [Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone]). Dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte, le Tribunal peut radier les parties des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions qui d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e l\u00e9gitime d\u2019une plainte (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, 2021 CF 969, au par. 154). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, ni la Commission ni Mme Rizzo ne contestent ce pouvoir du Tribunal.\n[10] Pour ces motifs, en application de la Loi et conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la jurisprudence, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il a comp\u00e9tence pour d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\nB. Si oui, les limites demand\u00e9es par Air Canada sont-elles justifi\u00e9es? (i) Le Tribunal doit-il examiner le motif de distinction du \u00ab sexe \u00bb?\n[11] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que le motif de distinction du \u00ab sexe \u00bb n\u2019est pas soulev\u00e9 dans la plainte et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019il ne doit pas \u00eatre examin\u00e9 dans le cadre de l\u2019instance.\n[12] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal a le pouvoir, dans certaines circonstances, de d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e des all\u00e9gations et, par cons\u00e9quent, de la limiter.\n[13] Par ailleurs, l\u2019instruction de l\u2019affaire ne peut porter sur une nouvelle plainte que la Commission n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9e puisque, selon la Loi, seule une plainte ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen peut \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction (LCDP, au par. 44(3) et \u00e0 l\u2019art. 49). D\u2019ailleurs, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 RCS 854, au paragraphe 48, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Loi pr\u00e9voit un processus complet de traitement des plaintes et que la Commission est un rouage essentiel de ce processus.\n[14] Je fais observer que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Dillman (IMP Group Limited v. Dillman (1995), 24 C.H.R.R. D\/329), la Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse critique le tribunal administratif institu\u00e9 en vertu de la Loi sur les droits de la personne de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Act, R.S.N.S. 1989, ch. 214), parce qu\u2019il a autoris\u00e9 une modification qui \u00e9tendait les faits de la plainte initiale au point o\u00f9 cela constituait une nouvelle plainte qui n\u2019avait pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Commission des droits de la personne de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, comme l\u2019exige la loi. La plainte initiale visait une situation de harc\u00e8lement par un coll\u00e8gue de travail tandis que la modification visait le refus de l\u2019employeur d\u2019accorder une promotion \u00e0 la plaignante. Les faits dont il \u00e9tait question dans la modification n\u2019avaient pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Commission des droits de la personne, de sorte que le processus pr\u00e9vu par la loi avait \u00e9t\u00e9 compromis. La Cour d\u2019appel a conclu que la modification propos\u00e9e constituait une nouvelle plainte qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission des droits de la personne, contrairement aux prescriptions de la Loi sur les droits de la personne de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse. La plainte initiale et la modification subs\u00e9quente constituaient en somme deux plaintes diff\u00e9rentes. Pour ces motifs, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse a accueilli l\u2019appel.\n[15] La jurisprudence qui porte sur ces principes est bien \u00e9tablie. Ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s notamment par le Tribunal et la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans les d\u00e9cisions Casler et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396), 2006 CF 704. La port\u00e9e du litige dont le Tribunal est saisi ne peut introduire une nouvelle plainte qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Commission et qui ne respecte pas la demande de la Commission d\u2019instruire la plainte. Le Tribunal n\u2019a donc pas le pouvoir de trancher une plainte qui n\u2019a pas d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par la Commission ni renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction (voir Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, [2002] D.C.D.P. no 12) [Cook]). Il faut donc se limiter \u00e0 la plainte et aux d\u00e9cisions de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette plainte, en particulier, \u00e0 la demande qu\u2019elle a adress\u00e9e au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction.\n[16] La notion de plainte est n\u00e9anmoins suffisamment large pour \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui englobe toute la port\u00e9e des all\u00e9gations de la partie plaignante (Cook, au par. 11). Une plainte est la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape dans le processus et il est in\u00e9vitable que de nouveaux faits et de nouvelles circonstances soient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission (Casler). La plainte se pr\u00e9cise au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le processus se d\u00e9roule (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, au par. 11) [Gaucher]). Toutefois, une limite s\u2019impose lorsque la modification d\u2019une plainte ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une simple modification, mais qu\u2019elle s\u2019apparente plut\u00f4t \u00e0 une nouvelle plainte (Gaucher). De m\u00eame, les all\u00e9gations de fait que le Tribunal doit examiner pour trancher le litige doivent, en quelque sorte, \u00e9maner de la plainte elle-m\u00eame ou en d\u00e9couler, \u00e0 la lecture de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, et ne doivent pas s\u2019en \u00e9carter de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 constituer une nouvelle plainte.\n[17] Le Tribunal estime que le motif de distinction illicite invoqu\u00e9 par une partie plaignante fait partie de sa th\u00e9orie de la cause. Cette th\u00e9orie lui appartient en propre. La partie plaignante peut choisir d\u2019inclure ou non un motif de distinction, tout comme elle peut soulever un argument ou un autre pour justifier les conclusions qu\u2019elle recherche, pourvu qu\u2019elle respecte le fond de la plainte initiale (Casler; Association canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone).\n[18] Dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 18 d\u00e9cembre 2018, Mme Rizzo mentionne la d\u00e9ficience comme motif de distinction illicite et d\u00e9crit les \u00e9v\u00e9nements li\u00e9s \u00e0 ce motif de distinction. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, elle \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Je d\u00e9pose une plainte pour le motif que je souffre de deux d\u00e9ficiences et qu\u2019Air Canada a pris comme mesure de mettre fin \u00e0 mon emploi, sans plus attendre, le 20 juillet 2017 \u00bb et \u00ab j\u2019ai \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination plus d\u2019une fois et pour plus d\u2019une maladie \u00bb. Elle pr\u00e9cise que les d\u00e9ficiences dont elle souffre sont une maladie du cerveau et une maladie mentale. Les actes discriminatoires qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit dans sa plainte sont des commentaires formul\u00e9s par son employeur, des d\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il a prises (notamment le cong\u00e9diement) et l\u2019absence de prise de mesures d\u2019adaptation, qui sont tous li\u00e9s \u00e0 ses d\u00e9ficiences.\n[19] Dans sa plainte, rien n\u2019indique, m\u00eame de fa\u00e7on implicite, que son employeur aurait formul\u00e9 des commentaires discriminatoires, commis des actes discriminatoires ou pris des d\u00e9cisions discriminatoires parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. Il n\u2019y a aucune all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Par cons\u00e9quent, le \u00ab sexe \u00bb n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un motif de distinction, m\u00eame implicite, dans la plainte de Mme Rizzo.\n[20] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 examiner le motif de distinction du \u00ab sexe \u00bb dans la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n(ii) Certains paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante devraient-ils \u00eatre modifi\u00e9s ou radi\u00e9s?\n[21] Le Tribunal estime que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions devrait demeurer sous sa forme actuelle.\n[22] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte, le Tribunal peut radier les parties des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions qui d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, 2021 CF 969, au par. 154). Toutefois, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir \u00ab avec prudence \u00bb et seulement dans les \u00ab cas les plus clairs \u00bb (Richards c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2020 TCDP 27, au par. 86).\n[23] Air Canada demande au Tribunal de refuser d\u2019examiner les all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe. Elle lui demande de ne pas tenir compte des all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es aux paragraphes 7 et 10 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Rizzo d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en janvier 2023.\n[24] Mme Rizzo \u00e9nonce ce qui suit aux paragraphes 7, 10, 11 et 12 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions :\n[traduction]\n7. En mai 2015 lors de la rencontre avec Steve et Donato, gestionnaires d\u2019AC, ils m\u2019ont dit, car \u00ab tu es une femme et la plupart des femmes ont tendance \u00e0 \u00eatre plus hyst\u00e9riques \u00bb. \u00ab Les hommes r\u00e9agissent diff\u00e9remment \u00bb selon les gestionnaires d\u2019AC.\n10. Le m\u00eame soir, en mai 2015, j\u2019ai appel\u00e9 Steve et Donato pour leur dire que j\u2019avais le sentiment que leur rapport \u00e9tait \u00ab BIAIS\u00c9 \u00bb, parce qu\u2019ils ne pouvaient pas enqu\u00eater sur eux-m\u00eames et arriver \u00e0 une conclusion juste, qu\u2019ils ne pouvaient pas me dire que j\u2019avais tout imagin\u00e9, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait totalement inappropri\u00e9 de me dire que j\u2019avais \u00ab c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019hyst\u00e9rie parce que j\u2019\u00e9tais une femme \u00bb. De plus, ils avaient ni\u00e9 mon droit \u00e0 la repr\u00e9sentation syndicale lors de cette r\u00e9union.\n11. D\u00e8s le lendemain, le gestionnaire m\u2019a appel\u00e9 et m\u2019a dit que j\u2019\u00e9tais \u00ab suspendue parce que j\u2019avais besoin d\u2019\u00eatre examin\u00e9e par un m\u00e9decin \u00bb. Il s\u2019appelait Basil Hardtman.\n12. J\u2019ai appel\u00e9 ma gestionnaire quelques jours plus tard, elle s\u2019appelle Mona Begum, et je lui ai demand\u00e9 pourquoi j\u2019avais \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue, et elle a dit que \u00ab je devais souffrir d\u2019un trouble psychologique grave pour avoir prononc\u00e9 le mot BIAIS\u00c9 \u00bb.\n[25] Bien qu\u2019on pourrait faire valoir que Mme Rizzo a ajout\u00e9, aux paragraphes 7 et 10 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, un motif de distinction qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas invoqu\u00e9 dans sa plainte initiale, soit celui du \u00ab sexe \u00bb, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu que ce soit le cas ni que les paragraphes 7 et 10 doivent \u00eatre radi\u00e9s.\n[26] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que l\u2019examen du contexte de la plainte et de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ne permet pas d\u2019affirmer que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u00e0 l\u2019intention de Mme Rizzo. On ne peut isoler les paragraphes 7 et 10 du contexte de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions complet, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment des paragraphes 11 et 12, qui sont adjacents aux paragraphes 7 et 10. Il semble que Mme Rizzo parle de conversations qu\u2019elle a eues avec les gestionnaires d\u2019Air Canada pour prouver que ceux-ci ont exerc\u00e9 de la discrimination \u00e0 son endroit en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[27] Mme Rizzo n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019Air Canada ou aux arguments de la Commission. Le Tribunal ne peut conclure que les paragraphes 7 et 10 ajoutent un nouveau motif de distinction, soit le \u00ab sexe \u00bb.\n[28] Par cons\u00e9quent, les paragraphes 7 et 10 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions seront consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des all\u00e9gations relatives au motif de distinction de la d\u00e9ficience.

Air Canada conteste la p\u00e9riode indiqu\u00e9e au paragraphe 40 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Rizzo, qui est r\u00e9dig\u00e9 ainsi : [traduction] \u00ab Air Canada m\u2019a impos\u00e9 des mesures disciplinaires, m\u2019a prise pour cible et a exerc\u00e9 de l\u2019intimidation et de la violence psychologique \u00e0 mon \u00e9gard de 2014 \u00e0 2023 \u00bb.\n[30] La Commission n\u2019a fait aucune observation au sujet de la demande d\u2019Air Canada de limiter l\u2019instruction \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de 2014 \u00e0 2018. Comme je l\u2019ai fait observer pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, Mme Rizzo n\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aucun argument en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019Air Canada.\n[31] Le 15 f\u00e9vrier 2022, dans sa lettre de renvoi au Tribunal, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9, en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 44(3)a)(i) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de vous demander d\u2019instruire la plainte relative aux all\u00e9gations se rapportant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de 2014 \u00e0 2018, car elle est convaincue que, compte tenu des circonstances, l\u2019examen de la plainte est justifi\u00e9e \u00bb.\n[32] Comme la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte relative aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination se rapportant \u00e0 la p\u00e9riode de 2014 \u00e0 2018, et en l\u2019absence d\u2019arguments contraires de la part de la plaignante ou de la Commission, le Tribunal conclut que la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e par l\u2019instruction s\u2019\u00e9tend de 2014 \u00e0 2018.\nV.

Campos-Ruiz \u00bb), soit radi\u00e9 en entier. La GRC pr\u00e9tend que toutes les all\u00e9gations contenues dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions se rapportent \u00e0 des parties de la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) n\u2019a jamais renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) pour instruction. La Commission convient que les all\u00e9gations se rapportent uniquement \u00e0 des questions dont le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi, mais soutient que M. Campos-Ruiz devrait \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[2] M. Campos-Ruiz s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la GRC en faisant valoir que toutes les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal et qu\u2019il a le droit d\u2019en traiter dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nII.

L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions traite-t-il de ces parties de la plainte? Sinon, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions devrait-il \u00eatre radi\u00e9 en entier? Si oui, M. Campos-Ruiz devrait-il \u00eatre autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9poser un nouvel expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour traiter des parties de la plainte qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal?\nIV. ANALYSE 1. Seule la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence de la GRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction [5] M. Campos-Ruiz a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en ao\u00fbt 2019. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, il \u00e9tait membre de la GRC depuis 11 ans. Son \u00e9pouse, Briana Campos-Ruiz (\u00ab Mme Campos-Ruiz \u00bb), \u00e9tait \u00e9galement membre de la GRC et tous deux travaillaient en Colombie-Britannique. Mme Campos-Ruiz \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 et ses m\u00e9decins lui avaient recommand\u00e9 de se rapprocher de sa famille en Saskatchewan afin de pouvoir b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du soutien de ses proches pendant son r\u00e9tablissement. M. Campos-Ruiz a donc demand\u00e9 une mutation \u00e0 la Division F de la GRC (Saskatchewan).\n[6] Dans sa plainte, il indique avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 que la mutation ne lui serait pas accord\u00e9e tant que sa conjointe ne serait pas en mesure de reprendre le travail de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter pleinement de ses fonctions ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas quitt\u00e9 la GRC. Il soutient donc avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait mari\u00e9, ce qui est un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille et l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial (l\u2019\u00ab all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation \u00bb).\n[7] Selon M. Campos-Ruiz, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la GRC a refus\u00e9 de le muter, son \u00e9pouse a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab forc\u00e9e \u00bb, plusieurs mois apr\u00e8s, de prendre sa retraite pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 et de quitter son emploi \u00e0 la GRC pour \u00e9liminer l\u2019obstacle \u00e0 la mutation. Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, il a re\u00e7u les documents approuvant sa mutation \u00e0 la Division F. Quatre choix de d\u00e9tachements lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts, dont trois \u00e9taient situ\u00e9s de 30 \u00e0 45 minutes de Regina, en Saskatchewan, l\u00e0 o\u00f9 son \u00e9pouse s\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e9tablie pour \u00eatre plus proche de sa famille. C\u2019est aussi l\u00e0 qu\u2019elle avait lanc\u00e9 sa nouvelle entreprise, aucunement li\u00e9e aux services de police, dans une d\u00e9marche th\u00e9rapeutique recommand\u00e9e par ses m\u00e9decins.\n[8] M. Campos-Ruiz affirme qu\u2019il a appris que la Division F disposait d\u2019une politique exigeant que les membres vivent dans un rayon de 40 km de la r\u00e9gion du d\u00e9tachement (la \u00ab politique sur la r\u00e9sidence \u00bb) lorsqu\u2019il a re\u00e7u les documents relatifs \u00e0 la mutation. Parmi les choix de d\u00e9tachements qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts, aucun ne se trouvait dans un tel rayon de Regina; il ne pouvait donc pas y r\u00e9sider ni y travailler, et ce, m\u00eame s\u2019il choisissait le d\u00e9tachement le plus proche, soit celui de Milestone, en Saskatchewan. Dans sa plainte, il semble all\u00e9guer que l\u2019application de cette politique constitue, dans son cas, un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial et la situation de famille.\n[9] Selon l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. Campos-Ruiz a pris un cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 au stress \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s au moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne et pris sa retraite de la GRC en mai 2020.\n[10] Apr\u00e8s avoir fait enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, la Commission a rendu la d\u00e9cision suivante le 6 octobre 2021, selon laquelle seule la partie concernant la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence devait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e :\n[traduction]\nD\u00c9CISION DE LA COMMISSION\nAvant de rendre sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission a examin\u00e9 le formulaire de plainte et le rapport de d\u00e9cision. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, la Commission d\u00e9cide :\nde ne pas statuer sur le volet de la plainte visant l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle on a refus\u00e9 au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une mutation parce que son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 pour des raisons de sant\u00e9, car ce volet de la plainte est vexatoire aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)d) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne;\nde statuer sur le volet de la plainte visant l\u2019all\u00e9gation concernant l\u2019application de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 41(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne.\nLa Commission d\u00e9cide \u00e9galement, conform\u00e9ment au sous-alin\u00e9a 44(3)a)(i) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, de demander au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne d\u2019instruire le volet de la plainte portant sur l\u2019application de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence, car compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celui-ci est justifi\u00e9.\n[11] Le 7 octobre 2021, la Commission a \u00e9crit au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal pour lui demander, en vertu du sous-alin\u00e9a 44(3)a)(i) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), d\u2019instruire le volet de la plainte portant sur [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019application de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence, car elle [la Commission] est convaincue que, compte tenu des circonstances relatives \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019examen de celui-ci est justifi\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[12] Le Tribunal tire sa comp\u00e9tence pour instruire des plaintes de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi, en vertu duquel le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal doit instruire la plainte sur r\u00e9ception de la demande de la Commission (au par 49(2)). La port\u00e9e des instructions du Tribunal est ainsi limit\u00e9e aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes qui accompagnent une telle demande (voir la d\u00e9cision Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22 (CanLII), au par. 7).\n[13] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission a exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir qui lui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par la Loi et a explicitement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas statuer sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation formul\u00e9e dans la plainte. Ainsi, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction du Tribunal est limit\u00e9e \u00e0 la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence.\n[14] M. Campos-Ruiz soutient que le Tribunal a n\u00e9anmoins comp\u00e9tence pour examiner l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation puisque cela contribuerait \u00e0 assurer une instruction compl\u00e8te de l\u2019affaire au vu de l\u2019ensemble de la situation. Il pr\u00e9tend que sa [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9mission forc\u00e9e \u00bb \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence et au refus de la mutation, et que ces deux facteurs ne peuvent \u00eatre dissoci\u00e9s l\u2019un de l\u2019autre. Il soutient que cette question \u00e0 deux volets a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction]\u00ab clairement renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal par la Commission \u00bb.\n[15] Dans les faits, c\u2019est plut\u00f4t le contraire. La Commission n\u2019aurait pas pu \u00eatre plus claire dans sa d\u00e9cision en concluant qu\u2019elle ne statuerait pas sur [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle on a refus\u00e9 au plaignant la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir une mutation parce que son \u00e9pouse \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[16] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal n\u2019est saisi que du volet de la plainte qui porte sur la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence.\n2. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n\u2019aborde pas la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence [17] Les faits et les questions abord\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ne portent que sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un constat que la Commission d\u00e9finit comme [traduction] \u00ab \u00e9vident \u00bb dans ses observations sur la requ\u00eate.\n[18] L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Campos-Ruiz d\u00e9taille les faits de l\u2019affaire en 14 paragraphes sous le titre [traduction] \u00ab Faits justificatifs \u00bb. Les cinq premiers \u00e9noncent les faits non contest\u00e9s, comme la date \u00e0 laquelle il a rejoint la GRC ou celle \u00e0 laquelle son \u00e9pouse a pris un cong\u00e9 de maladie. Les paragraphes 6 \u00e0 9 portent exclusivement sur les difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019il a rencontr\u00e9es pour obtenir une mutation et le lien entre le refus et la situation de son \u00e9pouse.\n[19] Au paragraphe 10, M. Campos-Ruiz d\u00e9clare qu\u2019il a pris un cong\u00e9 li\u00e9 au stress en ao\u00fbt 2019 et d\u00e9missionn\u00e9 en mai 2020. Il associe ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e0 la conduite de la GRC. Ces faits ne sont pas mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte puisqu\u2019ils se sont produits apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de celle-ci.\n[20] Aux paragraphes 11 \u00e0 13, M. Campos-Ruiz pr\u00e9cise les revenus et les avantages qu\u2019il a perdus parce qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab contraint de d\u00e9missionner \u00bb de la GRC.\n[21] Il conclut au paragraphe 14 en d\u00e9clarant que la conduite discriminatoire de la GRC l\u2019a pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 choisir entre son emploi et les besoins de sa famille.\n[22] Dans son r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des questions vis\u00e9es par la plainte, M. Campos-Ruiz d\u00e9clare avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur sa situation de famille et indique comme seul acte discriminatoire le fait que la GRC exige que son \u00e9pouse d\u00e9missionne avant d\u2019approuver, ou m\u00eame d\u2019examiner, sa demande de mutation. En d\u2019autres termes, il s\u2019agit de l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation.\n[23] Le reste de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions comporte une \u00e9num\u00e9ration des ordonnances qu\u2019il sollicite \u00e0 titre de redressement et une liste des t\u00e9moins qu\u2019il propose. Il inclut \u00e9galement une liste des documents pertinents prescrits par les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137, (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb).\n[24] La politique sur la r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est pas mentionn\u00e9e. L\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation est la seule all\u00e9gation figurant dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Campos-Ruiz.\n3. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions doit \u00eatre radi\u00e9 en entier [25] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la GRC souligne que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions est essentiel pour assurer un processus d\u2019audience \u00e9quitable. Selon les principes de justice naturelle, une partie \u00e0 une affaire doit conna\u00eetre la preuve \u00e0 laquelle elle doit r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Si les parties doivent pr\u00e9parer un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, c\u2019est dans le but de donner \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie une description suffisante et d\u00e9taill\u00e9e de leurs all\u00e9gations et des faits qu\u2019elles ont l\u2019intention de prouver \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Si un intim\u00e9 ne trouve pas dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des d\u00e9tails suffisants, il lui est impossible d\u2019interroger les t\u00e9moins potentiels ou de r\u00e9unir les documents potentiellement pertinents (Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2018 TCDP 2, au par. 34 (CanLII)).\n[26] M. Campos-Ruiz ne donne aucun d\u00e9tail dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions sur le seul volet de la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal pour instruction, soit la politique relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence. En fait, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions contient soit des renseignements g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, soit des renseignements sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation. Il ne concerne donc pas dans la partie de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[27] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de radier des pr\u00e9cisions figurant dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui ne s\u2019inscrivent pas dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction (Levasseur c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2021 TCDP 32, au par. 7).\n[28] M. Campos-Ruiz soutient que le Tribunal devrait refuser de le faire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qu\u2019il devrait exercer sa \u00ab comp\u00e9tence \u00bb pour inclure l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de la mutation puisque cela contribuerait \u00e0 assurer une instruction compl\u00e8te de l\u2019affaire au vu de l\u2019ensemble de la situation. Il fait valoir que la GRC n\u2019a soulev\u00e9 que des [traduction] \u00ab objections de forme \u00bb, qui peuvent \u00eatre examin\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle subirait si sa requ\u00eate \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e. Il renvoie \u00e0 des d\u00e9cisions dans lesquelles il a \u00e9t\u00e9 conclu que les intim\u00e9s devaient d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils subiraient un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el (Karas c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne du sang et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2020 TCDP 12 (CanLII) [Karas]; Association canadienne des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Elizabeth Fry c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2022 TCDP 12 (CanLII) [Elizabeth Fry].\n[29] Or, ces d\u00e9cisions prises hors de contexte. Dans la d\u00e9cision Karas, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la question de savoir s\u2019il devait entendre les deux plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es contre deux intim\u00e9s diff\u00e9rents lors d\u2019une seule et m\u00eame instruction. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas question de la port\u00e9e des plaintes ni de la question de savoir si des all\u00e9gations devaient \u00eatre radi\u00e9es. Dans la d\u00e9cision Elizabeth Fry, la question consistait \u00e0 savoir si le Tribunal allait permettre \u00e0 la Commission et au plaignant de modifier leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions ou de les \u00ab mettre \u00e0 jour \u00bb. Le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9, au paragraphe 14, que les modifications sont autoris\u00e9es si elles sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte initiale et ne causent pas de pr\u00e9judice aux autres parties. Toutefois, elles ne peuvent pas servir \u00e0 introduire fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cela contournerait le processus de renvoi de la Commission pr\u00e9vu par la Loi.\n[30] Ce dernier point est pertinent pour la pr\u00e9sente affaire. M. Campos-Ruiz a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui ne porte m\u00eame pas sur la seule et unique question que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, soit celle de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence. Si le Tribunal exer\u00e7ait la \u00ab comp\u00e9tence \u00bb qui, selon M. Campos-Ruiz, lui permettrait d\u2019examiner l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative au refus de mutation, le Tribunal introduirait en fait une nouvelle plainte dans le processus. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour introduire une nouvelle plainte. Il ne s\u2019agit pas seulement d\u2019une question \u00ab de forme \u00bb. La question de savoir si la GRC subirait un pr\u00e9judice si l\u2019all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait r\u00e9introduite n\u2019est pas pertinente. La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas demander l\u2019instruction de ce volet de la plainte et, si M. Campos-Ruiz n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait de cette d\u00e9cision, il aurait pu demander \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada de proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision. Apparemment, il ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[31] M. Campos-Ruiz soutient que l\u2019application de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence n\u2019est qu\u2019une question de preuve, car elle n\u2019\u00e9tait qu\u2019un des moyens utilis\u00e9s par la GRC pour lui refuser une mesure d\u2019adaptation. Les parties ne sont pas tenues de donner tous les d\u00e9tails de leur affaire dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, seulement les faits substantiels.\n[32] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation de la question soulev\u00e9e par la GRC. La politique sur la r\u00e9sidence \u00e9tait la seule partie de la plainte que la Commission avait renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. Il ne s\u2019agit pas seulement d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pour \u00e9tayer l\u2019affaire dont je suis saisi. Il s\u2019agit de l\u2019ensemble du dossier. Or, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n\u2019en fait aucune mention. En l\u2019absence de toute mention de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans sa forme actuelle n\u2019a pour ainsi dire aucun lien avec la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi.\n[33] M. Campos-Ruiz fait valoir qu\u2019il faut conna\u00eetre la situation de son \u00e9pouse pour comprendre l\u2019affaire dont est saisi le Tribunal. Son \u00e9pouse a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa propre plainte contre la GRC et cette plainte a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal. Il soutient que les deux plaintes devraient \u00eatre jointes. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une question qui a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2023. J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate en radiation de la GRC soit instruite en premier et que la possibilit\u00e9 de joindre les deux plaintes soit examin\u00e9e par la suite.\n[34] Il est donc toujours possible que les deux plaintes soient jointes et que le contexte n\u00e9cessaire soit fourni. Toutefois, le fait que deux plaintes puissent \u00eatre jointes aux fins de l\u2019audience ne permet pas au Tribunal de se saisir d\u2019une partie d\u2019une plainte que la Commission n\u2019a pas renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction.\n[35] Il peut \u00eatre important pour une affaire de conna\u00eetre le contexte, et certains renseignements figurant dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions actuel pourraient justement permettre cela. Toutefois, il n\u2019en demeure pas moins qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune mention dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la seule question qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction, \u00e0 savoir celle de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence. Comme je l\u2019ordonne plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, M. Campos-Ruiz pourra d\u00e9poser un autre expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Il pourra alors choisir d\u2019int\u00e9grer certains faits qui lui permettront de pr\u00e9senter le contexte en question, mais ceux-ci doivent \u00eatre centr\u00e9s sur la seule question dont le Tribunal est saisi et s\u2019y rapporter, soit la politique relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9sidence.\n[36] Puisque les pr\u00e9cisions ne concernent aucunement la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence, l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions doit \u00eatre radi\u00e9.\n4. Le plaignant peut d\u00e9poser un nouvel expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour traiter de la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence [37] Dans ses observations, M. Campos-Ruiz a demand\u00e9, \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier ses pr\u00e9cisions s\u2019il est conclu de les radier. Dans le m\u00eame ordre d\u2019id\u00e9es, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le Tribunal devait ordonner \u00e0 M. Campos-Ruiz de fournir des pr\u00e9cisions suppl\u00e9mentaires sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation relative \u00e0 la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence, au lieu de radier tout l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[38] M. Campos-Ruiz renvoie \u00e0 des cas o\u00f9 le Tribunal a permis aux parties de modifier leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. Toutefois, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, des modifications sont permises si elles constituent un ajout aux pr\u00e9cisions ou aux all\u00e9gations existantes et qu\u2019elles demeurent li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte initiale.\n[39] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les pr\u00e9cisions dans leur forme actuelle ne font aucune mention du volet de la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9 pour instruction. Nous ne pouvons parler de \u00ab pr\u00e9cisions plus compl\u00e8tes \u00bb puisque l\u2019all\u00e9gation qui se rapporte \u00e0 la politique sur la r\u00e9sidence n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[40] L\u2019approche la plus appropri\u00e9e et la plus juste consiste \u00e0 donner \u00e0 M. Campos-Ruiz la possibilit\u00e9 de \u00ab reprendre \u00e0 z\u00e9ro \u00bb pour ainsi dire, en radiant l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions existant et en lui permettant de d\u00e9poser un nouvel expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qui tienne compte des conclusions que j\u2019ai formul\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nV. ORDONNANCE [41] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, le Tribunal accueille la requ\u00eate de la GRC. Les pr\u00e9cisions figurant dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Campos-Ruiz sous les rubriques [traduction] A) Faits justificatifs, B) Questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte, C) Ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e sont radi\u00e9es.\n[42] M. Campos-Ruiz peut d\u00e9poser un nouvel expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au plus tard le 2 juin 2023.\n[43] La GRC d\u00e9posera son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et la divulgation connexe conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 20 des R\u00e8gles de pratique au plus tard le 23 juin 2023.\n[44] M. Campos-Ruiz pourra ensuite d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la GRC au plus tard le 30 juin 2023.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios Hadjis\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 12 mai 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T2739\/11521\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz c.

ORDONNANCE 8\nI. APER\u00c7U [1] L\u2019intim\u00e9, le procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant la Gendarmerie royale du Canada) (la \u00ab GRC \u00bb), demande au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et de radier plusieurs paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, Briana Campos-Ruiz. La GRC affirme que les paragraphes contest\u00e9s visent \u00e0 \u00e9tendre inutilement la port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans la plainte que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal.\n[2] Mme Campos-Ruiz s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et soutient que les pr\u00e9tentions contenues dans ces paragraphes (les \u00ab pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es \u00bb) brossent le tableau complet du traitement que lui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 la GRC et viennent compl\u00e9ter la plainte. Elle demande que la plainte soit modifi\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es.\n[3] Les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es sont expos\u00e9es dans une liste jointe en tant qu\u2019annexe A \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je rejetterai la requ\u00eate de la GRC et j\u2019accueillerai la demande de Mme Campos-Ruiz visant \u00e0 modifier sa plainte.\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE [5] Les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es renvoient \u00e0 des incidents qui se sont produits apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte et qui n\u2019\u00e9taient \u00e9videmment pas inclus dans la plainte initiale.\n[6] Je dois donc trancher la question suivante :\nLes pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es doivent-elles \u00eatre radi\u00e9es ou, subsidiairement, Mme Campos-Ruiz doit-elle \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier la plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 les inclure?\nIV. LES PR\u00c9TENTIONS CONTEST\u00c9ES [7] Mme Campos-Ruiz a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en f\u00e9vrier 2018. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, elle \u00e9tait au service de la GRC depuis 16 ans, dans la ville de Langley, en Colombie-Britannique, mais \u00e9tait en cong\u00e9 de maladie depuis avril 2016 apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u un diagnostic de maladie. Elle affirme que, tout au long de son cong\u00e9 de maladie, elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur la d\u00e9ficience. Selon le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission figurant au d\u00e9but de la plainte, la disposition concern\u00e9e de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), est l\u2019article 7, qui traite des actes discriminatoires en cours d\u2019emploi. La section de la plainte qui pr\u00e9sente la version des faits de la plaignante renvoie aussi \u00e0 l\u2019article 10 (lignes de conduite discriminatoires) et \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 (harc\u00e8lement) de la Loi.\n[8] La plainte d\u00e9crit plusieurs actes de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement dont Mme Campos-Ruiz affirme avoir fait l\u2019objet. Le premier acte concerne ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit comme le refus injustifi\u00e9 de la part de la GRC d\u2019approuver son deuxi\u00e8me emploi. Son prestataire de soins m\u00e9dicaux lui avait conseill\u00e9 d\u2019ouvrir une petite entreprise \u00e0 domicile pour lui donner un certain cadre et une raison de se lever le matin, ce qui aiderait \u00e0 son r\u00e9tablissement. Elle a suivi un cours et a obtenu un certificat dans un domaine non li\u00e9 au maintien de l\u2019ordre. Elle a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC d\u2019approuver son deuxi\u00e8me emploi apr\u00e8s avoir entendu que le processus \u00e9tait simple et que l\u2019approbation serait probablement accord\u00e9e. Elle a d\u00e9marr\u00e9 sa nouvelle entreprise et a vu sa sant\u00e9 s\u2019am\u00e9liorer. Toutefois, plusieurs mois plus tard, en octobre 2016, elle a appris que sa demande d\u2019approbation avait \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce que la direction \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e par le fait qu\u2019elle travaillait ailleurs pendant son cong\u00e9 de maladie.\n[9] Dans sa plainte, Mme Campos-Ruiz affirme qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement lorsque, en juin 2017, la GRC a ouvert une enqu\u00eate sur elle au motif qu\u2019elle aurait contrevenu au code de d\u00e9ontologie de la GRC en exer\u00e7ant un deuxi\u00e8me emploi et en ayant quitt\u00e9 sa zone de service sans autorisation. Cette situation a nui \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9 qui, selon elle, s\u2019est d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e en raison de plusieurs appels de repr\u00e9sentants de la GRC re\u00e7us dans les mois qui ont suivi, appels qu\u2019elle a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9s comme des menaces et du harc\u00e8lement voil\u00e9s.\n[10] La plainte initiale ne contient aucun autre exemple de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement.\n[11] Cependant, Mme Campos-Ruiz soutient que les actes de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement se sont poursuivis apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Ces actes ult\u00e9rieurs sont d\u00e9crits dans les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es.\n[12] En avril 2018, Mme Campos-Ruiz a obtenu l\u2019autorisation m\u00e9dicale de retourner travailler \u00e0 la GRC, pourvu que certaines mesures d\u2019adaptation soient prises. Elle affirme que la GRC a n\u00e9glig\u00e9 ou refus\u00e9 de prendre ces mesures et, par cons\u00e9quent, qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb demeurer en cong\u00e9 de maladie, ce qui a aggrav\u00e9 davantage son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9.\n[13] En juillet 2018, elle a demand\u00e9 de nouveau \u00e0 la GRC d\u2019approuver son deuxi\u00e8me emploi, mais la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e le mois suivant. Elle soutient que ses prestataires de soins m\u00e9dicaux lui ont alors sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager en Saskatchewan, o\u00f9 elle pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du soutien de sa famille.\n[14] Son conjoint, Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz, travaille \u00e9galement \u00e0 la GRC, en Colombie-Britannique. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre mut\u00e9 en Saskatchewan pour accompagner sa conjointe, mais la GRC lui a r\u00e9pondu que sa demande ne serait pas approuv\u00e9e tant que la situation de Mme Campos-Ruiz n\u2019\u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9gl\u00e9e \u00bb. Mme Campos-Ruiz soutient que la seule fa\u00e7on de \u00ab r\u00e9gler \u00bb la situation, compte tenu du refus de la GRC de lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation, \u00e9tait de d\u00e9missionner de la GRC, ce qu\u2019elle a fait lorsqu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9 de prendre sa retraite pour raisons m\u00e9dicales en avril 2019. Par la suite, la demande de mutation en Saskatchewan de son conjoint a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e.\n[15] Les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es comprennent une demande d\u2019indemnisation pour la perte des revenus d\u2019emploi et de pension qu\u2019elle aurait touch\u00e9s si elle n\u2019avait pas pris sa retraite en avril 2019.\n[16] Dans les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es, Mme Campos-Ruiz affirme avoir fait l\u2019objet de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, en plus de celle fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Elle soutient que la GRC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, en violation de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, en l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 d\u00e9missionner pour que la demande de mutation en Saskatchewan de son conjoint soit approuv\u00e9e, voire simplement examin\u00e9e. Elle affirme \u00e9galement que la GRC a omis de lui offrir des mesures d\u2019adaptation raisonnables pour faciliter son retour au travail.\nV. ANALYSE A. Les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es ne doivent pas \u00eatre radi\u00e9es et Mme Campos-Ruiz peut modifier sa plainte [17] La GRC soutient que le Tribunal ne peut instruire les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es. Elle fait valoir que le Tribunal tire sa comp\u00e9tence pour instruire une plainte de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi, selon lequel le pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal doit d\u00e9signer un membre pour instruire une plainte sur r\u00e9ception d\u2019une demande \u00e0 cet effet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la Commission (au par. 49(2)). La port\u00e9e de l\u2019instruction par le Tribunal est ainsi limit\u00e9e aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte qui accompagne cette demande (Kowalski c. Ryder Integrated Logistics, 2009 TCDP 22 (CanLII), au par. 7). La GRC fait valoir que, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la plainte de Mme Campos-Ruiz ne mentionnait aucune des pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour les instruire et doit donc les radier de l\u2019EDP de la plaignante.\n[18] Mme Campos-Ruiz r\u00e9pond qu\u2019elle doit \u00eatre autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 modifier sa plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es.\n[19] Comme il est mentionn\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Blodgett c. GE-Hitachi Nuclear Energy Canada Inc., 2013 TCDP 24, aux paragraphes 16 et 17, le paragraphe 48.9(2) de la Loi accorde au Tribunal une discr\u00e9tion consid\u00e9rable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des plaintes, notamment en ce qui concerne le fait de faire droit \u00e0 des requ\u00eates en modification d\u2019une plainte ou de rejeter celles-ci. Le Tribunal jouit du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019autoriser des modifications aux fins de d\u00e9terminer \u00ab les v\u00e9ritables questions litigieuses entre les parties \u00bb, pourvu que cette autorisation serve les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Parent, 2006 CF 1313 (CanLII), au par. 30). Le Tribunal doit tenir compte du pr\u00e9judice que l\u2019autorisation des modifications causerait aux autres parties. Les modifications seront autoris\u00e9es si la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des inconv\u00e9nients favorise le plaignant. Aucun pr\u00e9judice n\u2019est caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019autre partie si elle est en mesure de se pr\u00e9parer et de faire valoir sa position sur les nouvelles questions soulev\u00e9es (Parent, au par. 40). En outre, les modifications ne peuvent aboutir \u00e0 une nouvelle plainte et doivent \u00eatre li\u00e9es aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale (Tran c. l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, 2010 TCDP 31 (CanLII), aux par. 17-18). Autrement dit, il doit y avoir un lien, en fait et en droit, entre la plainte et les modifications demand\u00e9es.\n[20] Comme je l\u2019expliquerai plus loin, je juge qu\u2019il existe un lien entre les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es et la plainte initiale de Mme Campos-Ruiz, et que la GRC ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si la plainte est modifi\u00e9e.\n(i) Il existe un lien suffisant en fait et en droit avec les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte [21] Les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es sont li\u00e9es en fait et en droit avec les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte, particuli\u00e8rement en ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience. Bien que Mme Campos-Ruiz n\u2019ait pas officiellement employ\u00e9 le terme [traduction] \u00ab mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00bb dans sa plainte, elle a clairement ax\u00e9 celle-ci sur la mani\u00e8re dont la GRC l\u2019a trait\u00e9e et a trait\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience. Comme elle l\u2019indique dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la GRC, le traitement que la GRC lui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9 relativement \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience est manifestement un facteur commun qui sous-tend la plainte initiale et les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es.\n[22] Elle affirme que, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, la GRC a continu\u00e9 de nuire \u00e0 ses efforts pour prendre du mieux et retourner au travail, soit en ne lui offrant aucune mesure d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 son travail en Colombie-Britannique, soit en l\u2019emp\u00eachant dans les faits de d\u00e9m\u00e9nager en Saskatchewan.\n[23] En termes juridiques, elle affirme que son employeur l\u2019a emp\u00each\u00e9 de travailler en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience, ce qui peut constituer un acte discriminatoire au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, et qu\u2019il ne lui a pas offert de mesures d\u2019adaptation dans la mesure o\u00f9 cela ne constitue pas une contrainte excessive.\n[24] Ainsi, les all\u00e9gations contenues dans la plainte initiale et les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es sont toutes ax\u00e9es sur le traitement de la d\u00e9ficience de Mme Campos-Ruiz et sur la question de savoir si des mesures d\u2019adaptation lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offertes. Il y a un lien entre elles.\n[25] Certes, Mme Campos-Ruiz affirme \u00e9galement dans les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es que sa situation de famille a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans les actes discriminatoires dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, et ce motif de plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas mentionn\u00e9 dans la plainte initiale. Cependant, je suis convaincu qu\u2019il existe un lien suffisant entre les faits relatifs \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9tention et les autres all\u00e9gations concernant l\u2019absence de prise de mesures d\u2019adaptation pour en justifier l\u2019inclusion dans la plainte.\n[26] Je conclus donc qu\u2019il existe un lien entre l\u2019ensemble des pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es et la plainte initiale.\n(ii) La GRC ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si la plainte est modifi\u00e9e [27] La GRC ne subira aucun pr\u00e9judice si la plainte est modifi\u00e9e. Elle \u00e9tait au courant des pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es depuis au moins le 25 juin 2021, date \u00e0 laquelle l\u2019enqu\u00eateur de la Commission a termin\u00e9 son rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la plainte. Le rapport a mentionn\u00e9 les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es, mais elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9es parce que l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019elles d\u00e9passaient la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Toutefois, l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a ajout\u00e9 que, si la plainte \u00e9tait renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction, Mme Campos-Ruiz pourrait [traduction] \u00ab demander l\u2019ajout des all\u00e9gations \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 \u00bb.\n[28] La GRC fait valoir que les commentaires de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur ne touchent nullement la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Toutefois, je juge qu\u2019ils d\u00e9montrent tout de m\u00eame que la GRC est bien au fait des pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es et ne peut affirmer que la demande de modification de Mme Campos-Ruiz la prend par surprise.\n[29] La GRC soutient que Mme Campos-Ruiz \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab oblig\u00e9e \u00bb de modifier sa plainte initiale avant que la Commission n\u2019ait fini de la traiter et qu\u2019elle ne soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, conform\u00e9ment aux paragraphes 9.1 \u00e0 9.3 des R\u00e8gles relatives aux plaintes de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne. Il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal d\u2019examiner la mani\u00e8re dont les plaintes sont trait\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la Commission, avant qu\u2019elles ne lui soient renvoy\u00e9es. Mme Campos-Ruiz a peut-\u00eatre eu la possibilit\u00e9 de modifier sa plainte en vertu de ces r\u00e8gles. Or, comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement le pouvoir d\u2019autoriser la modification d\u2019une plainte lorsque les circonstances le justifient.\n[30] La GRC affirme que le fait d\u2019autoriser la modification lui causera un pr\u00e9judice important, car l\u2019autorisation augmentera le co\u00fbt, la dur\u00e9e et la complexit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure, et elle l\u2019obligera \u00e0 produire d\u2019autres documents et \u00e0 appeler d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame des t\u00e9moins experts.\n[31] L\u2019audience pourrait effectivement devenir plus complexe, mais il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9cessaire du fait que les questions en jeu sont finalement plus larges que celles que Mme Campos-Ruiz a soulev\u00e9es initialement dans sa plainte, qui \u00e9taient fond\u00e9es sur les faits survenus \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. Je ne suis pas convaincu que la GRC, en tant qu\u2019organisation, subira un pr\u00e9judice important d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019ajout des questions connexes. M\u00eame si la plainte aurait pu \u00eatre modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 une \u00e9tape ant\u00e9rieure, rien n\u2019indique que la GRC ne sera pas en mesure de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux nouvelles questions soulev\u00e9es (Parent, au par. 40).\n[32] Dans le cadre de mes conclusions, je souligne que, dans une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate concernant une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le conjoint de Mme Campos-Ruiz, M. Campos-Ruiz (Osvaldo Campos-Ruiz c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2023 TCDP 17), que je rends en m\u00eame temps que la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, je conclus que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour se prononcer sur les all\u00e9gations du conjoint selon lesquelles la GRC aurait fait preuve \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille et l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial lorsqu\u2019elle a rejet\u00e9 sa demande de mutation en Saskatchewan. Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir les parties que l\u2019audience concernant la plainte de Mme Campos-Ruiz, y compris les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es, ne peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re incidente pour faire valoir les all\u00e9gations de son conjoint, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[33] Mes remarques sont particuli\u00e8rement importantes compte tenu de la possibilit\u00e9, comme il en a \u00e9t\u00e9 question lors de la premi\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, que les deux plaintes soient trait\u00e9es conjointement sur le plan administratif aux fins de l\u2019audience. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une question distincte qui pourra \u00eatre abord\u00e9e lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire future.\n[34] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que Mme Campos-Ruiz peut modifier sa plainte de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es.\nVI. ORDONNANCE [35] La plainte de Mme Campos-Ruiz est r\u00e9put\u00e9e avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 y inclure les pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es.\n[36] La requ\u00eate en radiation des pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la GRC est rejet\u00e9e.\n[37] Le Tribunal a suspendu les d\u00e9lais impartis \u00e0 la GRC pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son EDP suivant l\u2019article 20 des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137, en attendant l\u2019issue de la requ\u00eate. Les d\u00e9lais recommencent donc maintenant \u00e0 courir. La GRC doit d\u00e9poser son EDP d\u2019ici le 2 juin 2023. Mme Campos-Ruiz peut pr\u00e9senter sa r\u00e9plique \u00e0 l\u2019EDP de la GRC d\u2019ici le 9 juin 2023.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios Hadjis\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 12 mai 2023\nANNEXE A\nLes pr\u00e9tentions contest\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Campos-Ruiz, dont la GRC demande la radiation, sont les suivantes :\nParagraphes 29 \u00e0 31\nParagraphes 33 (\u00e0 partir des mots \u00ab - notwithstanding \u2013 accommodate. \u00bb) \u00e0 41 de la partie A, qui porte sur les faits \u00e0 l\u2019appui\nLes points 1b), 2d) et e) de la partie B, qui porte sur les questions que soul\u00e8ve la plainte\nLes paragraphes 2 et 3 de la partie C, qui porte sur les ordonnances demand\u00e9es, de m\u00eame que l\u2019annexe A, qui concernent l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle la GRC n\u2019a pas offert de mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 Mme Campos-Ruiz pour faciliter son retour au travail, l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle celle-ci a \u00e9t\u00e9 contrainte de d\u00e9missionner ainsi que le nouveau motif de discrimination invoqu\u00e9 (la situation de famille) et les mesures de r\u00e9paration correspondantes\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T2795\/11121\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Briana Campos-Ruiz c.

Amond le 28 mars 2019, dans laquelle il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb) de la part de son employeur, Euro Link Logistic, est rejet\u00e9e, car elle semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e.\nII. CONTEXTE [2] Le 9 ao\u00fbt 2022, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Amond ainsi qu\u2019aux avocats de la Commission et de l\u2019intim\u00e9e une premi\u00e8re lettre contenant des renseignements sur les prochaines \u00e9tapes et les d\u00e9lais \u00e0 respecter. Cette lettre contenait aussi de l\u2019information sur le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats, la m\u00e9diation confidentielle, la gestion de l\u2019instance dans le cadre du processus d\u2019instruction et les ressources accessibles aux parties pour les aider \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer leur dossier. Le Tribunal demandait aux parties de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certaines questions, notamment si elles souhaitaient avoir recours \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation, si elles souhaitaient participer en personne ou par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence, si elles \u00e9taient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, quel \u00e9tait leur choix de langue et si elles avaient besoin de mesures d\u2019adaptation. Une r\u00e9ponse aux questions devait \u00eatre envoy\u00e9e par courriel ou par la poste au bureau du greffe du Tribunal avant le 23 ao\u00fbt 2022. Les num\u00e9ros de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et de t\u00e9l\u00e9copieur du bureau du greffe \u00e9taient \u00e9galement fournis au cas o\u00f9 les parties auraient des questions. La lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courrier recommand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de M. Amond que la Commission avait fournie au Tribunal, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e avec la mention \u00ab non livrable \u00bb.\n[3] Le personnel du greffe a tent\u00e9 de joindre M. Amond par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone les 23 et 25 ao\u00fbt au num\u00e9ro fourni au Tribunal par la Commission, mais personne n\u2019a r\u00e9pondu aux appels et ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9s \u00e0 une bo\u00eete vocale.\n[4] Le 29 ao\u00fbt 2022, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre modifi\u00e9e aux parties, laquelle \u00e9tait identique \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re lettre, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la date limite pour la r\u00e9ception d\u2019une r\u00e9ponse, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 chang\u00e9e pour le 16 septembre 2022. Cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courrier ordinaire et par service de messagerie \u00e0 M. Amond, \u00e0 l\u2019adresse que la Commission avait fournie au Tribunal. Le 1er septembre 2022, le personnel du greffe a de nouveau tent\u00e9 de joindre M. Amond par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone au num\u00e9ro fourni par la Commission, mais personne n\u2019a r\u00e9pondu et l\u2019appel a encore \u00e9t\u00e9 achemin\u00e9 \u00e0 une bo\u00eete vocale. La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que les seules coordonn\u00e9es qu\u2019ils avaient pour M. Amond \u00e9taient le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et l\u2019adresse utilis\u00e9s par le Tribunal dans sa correspondance et ses appels.\n[5] M. Amond n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la lettre modifi\u00e9e du Tribunal. Le 27 janvier 2023, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u de la correspondance du cabinet d\u2019avocats repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui demandait que la plainte soit rejet\u00e9e, car ils avaient r\u00e9pondu deux fois aux questions contenues dans les lettres et savaient que le Tribunal \u00e9tait incapable de joindre M. Amond.\n[6] Le 15 mars 2023, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une autre lettre aux parties, \u00e0 laquelle il a joint une copie de la lettre modifi\u00e9e du 29 ao\u00fbt 2022 et la demande envoy\u00e9e par le cabinet d\u2019avocats le 27 janvier 2023 afin de faire rejeter la plainte. Dans cette lettre, le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 ceci : [traduction] \u00ab \u00c0 moins que nous recevions une r\u00e9ponse du plaignant avant le 31 mars 2023 expliquant pourquoi il n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 nos lettres du 9 et du 29 ao\u00fbt 2022 et aux questions qu\u2019elles contenaient, nous acquiescerons \u00e0 la demande du cabinet d\u2019avocats repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019intim\u00e9e et rejetterons la plainte. \u00bb Cette lettre a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courrier ordinaire et par service de messagerie \u00e0 M. Amond, \u00e0 l\u2019adresse que la Commission avait fournie au Tribunal. Le Tribunal n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune r\u00e9ponse de M. Amond et la lettre recommand\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 retourn\u00e9e parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9clam\u00e9e.\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE [7] La seule question \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est celle de savoir si la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nIV. ANALYSE [8] L\u2019article 5 des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb) pr\u00e9voit que les R\u00e8gles doivent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre de trancher la plainte sur le fond de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable, informelle et rapide. L\u2019article 9 pr\u00e9voit quant \u00e0 lui que si une partie omet de se conformer aux R\u00e8gles, \u00e0 une ordonnance de la formation ou \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des R\u00e8gles, la formation peut, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances, de sa propre initiative ou sur requ\u00eate d\u2019une autre partie, rejeter la plainte afin de respecter le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 des R\u00e8gles.\n[9] Vu les circonstances \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-dessus, le Tribunal a fait tout ce qui \u00e9tait raisonnablement en son pouvoir pour communiquer avec M. Amond et instruire la plainte, mais M. Amond n\u2019a jamais r\u00e9pondu. Par cons\u00e9quent, il semble avoir abandonn\u00e9 sa plainte et celle-ci devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 5 des R\u00e8gles.\nV. ORDONNANCE [10] La plainte de M.

Contexte\n[1] Stacy White, la plaignante, travaillait pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Laboratoires Nucl\u00e9aires Canadiens lt\u00e9e (\u00ab LNC \u00bb). Lors d\u2019un incident en milieu de travail, Sue Fleming, une coll\u00e8gue, l\u2019a prise au cou. Mme White all\u00e8gue qu\u2019en raison de cet incident, et de ses pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes interactions avec Mme Fleming, elle a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9prouver des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 n\u00e9cessitant la prise de mesures d\u2019adaptation, lesquelles consistaient notamment \u00e0 assurer qu\u2019elle demeure physiquement s\u00e9par\u00e9e de Mme Fleming. Mme White affirme que LNC n\u2019a pas tenu compte de ses besoins li\u00e9s \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience puisqu\u2019elle l\u2019a contrainte \u00e0 revoir Mme Fleming, ce qui a eu pour effet d\u2019aggraver son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. LNC soutient qu\u2019elle ne savait pas, et ne pouvait raisonnablement savoir, que la plaignante avait une d\u00e9ficience pouvant n\u00e9cessiter la prise de mesures d\u2019adaptation.\n[2] L\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire doit commencer le 16 janvier 2023. Le 10 janvier 2023, LNC et Mme White ont chacune demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019autre de produire des documents qui, \u00e0 leur avis, sont potentiellement pertinents quant aux questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[3] LNC a envoy\u00e9 sa demande par courriel. Ont ensuite suivi de nombreux courriels, qui comportaient plusieurs all\u00e9gations graves au sujet des avocats. Au moyen d\u2019une directive, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9ciser leurs demandes de divulgation et leurs r\u00e9ponses respectives. Elles ont obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 cette directive.\n[4] La Commission n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cet \u00e9change de courriels si ce n\u2019est pour confirmer qu\u2019elle avait satisfait \u00e0 ses obligations de divulgation. Elle n\u2019a pas pris position \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des demandes de production.\nConduite des avocats\n[5] Les commentaires suivants ne mettent aucunement en cause la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ou ses avocats, anciens ou actuels.\n[6] Le 10 janvier 2023, les parties ont envoy\u00e9 plusieurs courriels au Tribunal. Le premier courriel envoy\u00e9 par LNC comportait une br\u00e8ve demande d\u2019ordonnance de production. Avant que le Tribunal n\u2019ait pu donner une directive aux autres parties et leur demander de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations, l\u2019avocate de Mme White a r\u00e9pondu. Son courriel contenait un r\u00e9cit pr\u00e9occupant au sujet des interactions entre son cabinet, l\u2019avocat de LNC et le cabinet de celui\u2011ci, de m\u00eame que des all\u00e9gations graves concernant l\u2019avocat. Mme Roth a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que, si une ordonnance de divulgation devait \u00eatre rendue \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Mme White, elle serait contest\u00e9e, et que [traduction] \u00ab dans ce cas, l\u2019audience sera sans doute ajourn\u00e9e jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la d\u00e9cision soit examin\u00e9e \u00bb. La demande de production de Mme White a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans ce courriel de r\u00e9ponse.\n[7] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u sept courriels des avocats pour le compte de Mme White et de LNC, j\u2019ai d\u00fb donner une directive ordonnant aux parties de cesser imm\u00e9diatement d\u2019\u00e9crire au Tribunal, \u00e0 moins que ce ne soit pour faire une demande pr\u00e9cise d\u2019intervention de ma part ou pour obtemp\u00e9rer \u00e0 une directive du Tribunal. Je leur ai \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 de faire preuve de respect l\u2019une envers l\u2019autre, envers le Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de son mandat. J\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 que le Tribunal a l\u2019obligation de conduire ses proc\u00e9dures de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et rapide, mais aussi que les avocats ont un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer dans tout cela. J\u2019ai rappel\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab le fait d\u2019obliger les ressources d\u00e9j\u00e0 limit\u00e9es \u00e0 lire des courriels, \u00e0 y r\u00e9pondre et \u00e0 r\u00e9gler les questions qu\u2019ils soul\u00e8vent, alors que ce n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pas n\u00e9cessaire pour trancher les questions en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, ne favorise pas un d\u00e9nouement rapide de l\u2019affaire \u00bb.\n[8] J\u2019ai finalement ordonn\u00e9 au greffe de trier les courriels des parties et de cesser de me transf\u00e9rer les messages, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019ils ne soient conformes \u00e0 ma directive, soulignant que les messages qui s\u2019adressaient uniquement aux avocats ne tombaient pas dans cette cat\u00e9gorie. J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que tous les documents qui ne respectaient pas ces param\u00e8tres seraient renvoy\u00e9s aux parties et ne seraient pas vers\u00e9s au dossier du Tribunal.\n[9] Malheureusement, ce n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que je dois rappeler aux avocats d\u2019agir avec respect et courtoisie dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. Ce type de comportement n\u2019aide pas le Tribunal dans sa t\u00e2che et constitue un gaspillage de nos ressources collectives. [traduction] \u00ab Une conduite incivile, abrasive, hostile ou r\u00e9calcitrante nuit forc\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e9alisation de l\u2019objectif de r\u00e9gler les conflits de fa\u00e7on rationnelle, pacifique et efficace et cause plut\u00f4t des retards, voire des d\u00e9nis de justice [\u2026] \u00bb (Groia c. Barreau du Haut-Canada, 2018 CSC 27, au par. 64, citant K. A. Nagorney, \u00ab A Noble Profession? A Discussion of Civility Among Lawyers \u00bb (1999) 12 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 815, \u00e0 la p. 817) [Groia].\n[10] Les parties peuvent pr\u00e9senter des demandes visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance du Tribunal, notamment une demande d\u2019ordonnance de production. Mais il est inacceptable que les r\u00e9ponses et la correspondance subs\u00e9quente contiennent des propos incendiaires et accusateurs qui sont loin de correspondre \u00e0 la civilit\u00e9, \u00e0 la courtoise et au respect dont j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de faire preuve. J\u2019en parlerai aux avocats au d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. \u00ab Pratiquer le droit avec civilit\u00e9 comporte de nombreux avantages, tant pour les individus en cause que pour la profession dans son ensemble. \u00c0 l\u2019inverse, l\u2019incivilit\u00e9 nuit \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s et \u00e0 l\u2019administration de la justice de plusieurs fa\u00e7ons \u00bb (Groia, au par. 63). Je m\u2019attends \u00e0 ce que Ies avocats choisissent judicieusement leurs batailles, agissent de fa\u00e7on proportionn\u00e9e dans le traitement du dossier et s\u2019abstiennent de toute incivilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avenir.\nD\u00c9CISION\n[11] La demande de LNC est accueillie. La demande de Mme White est rejet\u00e9e.\nMOTIFS\n[12] Les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs arguments (par. 50(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb)). Elles ont notamment droit \u00e0 la divulgation de tous les renseignements potentiellement pertinents que d\u00e9tient la partie adverse afin que chacune des parties connaisse la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et puisse se pr\u00e9parer pour l\u2019audience. Voir Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2019 TCDP 8, au paragraphe 4. Les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal exigent que chaque partie divulgue une copie de tous les documents qu\u2019elle a en sa possession relativement \u00e0 un fait, \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 une forme de redressement demand\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire, y compris ceux mentionn\u00e9s par d\u2019autres parties (alin\u00e9a 19(1)e) des R\u00e8gles). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une obligation continue (par. 24(1)(2) des R\u00e8gles).\n[13] Le crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 la divulgation est celui de la pertinence possible ou potentielle. Bien qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agisse pas d\u2019un crit\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement strict, la partie qui demande la production d\u2019un document doit quand m\u00eame d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe un lien rationnel entre le document demand\u00e9 et les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte (T.P. c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2019 TCDP 19, au par. 11; Turner c. ASFC, 2018 TCDP 1, au par. 30 [Turner]). Les demandes de divulgation ne doivent pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culatives ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache (Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2017 TCDP 33, aux par. 31-32 [Egan], et Turner, au par. 30).\n[14] Le fait que des documents soient divulgu\u00e9s ne signifie pas qu\u2019ils seront admis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Si une partie s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve propos\u00e9, elle peut soulever la question \u00e0 l\u2019audience et pr\u00e9senter des observations sur le poids que le d\u00e9cideur devrait accorder \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment s\u2019il est admis en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\nLa demande d\u2019ordonnance de production de LNC\n[15] LNC veut que le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 Mme White de produire une copie des notes qu\u2019elle a prises au sujet du harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. LNC affirme qu\u2019elle n\u2019a d\u00e9couvert l\u2019existence de ces notes que le 10 janvier 2023 lorsque l\u2019un de ses repr\u00e9sentants juridiques a examin\u00e9 les originaux de documents d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s au cabinet de Mme Roth, l\u2019avocate de Mme White. Le repr\u00e9sentant juridique de LNC a remarqu\u00e9 une s\u00e9rie de pages agraf\u00e9es dans la copie imprim\u00e9e du cahier de notes de Mme White qui ne semblaient pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9es auparavant. L\u2019avocat de LNC a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 les examiner sous toutes r\u00e9serves pour en d\u00e9terminer la pertinence.\n[16] Mme White s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette demande. Elle a d\u2019abord affirm\u00e9 que les notes demand\u00e9es \u00e9taient de nature personnelle. Elle a par la suite ajout\u00e9 que ces notes se rapportaient au harc\u00e8lement que lui aurait fait subir son ancienne coll\u00e8gue, mais qu\u2019elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas potentiellement pertinentes quant aux questions en litige. Selon Mme White, les notes ne font allusion \u00e0 rien de ce qu\u2019elle a discut\u00e9 avec ses gestionnaires et ses superviseurs. Les notes ne permettront pas selon elle au Tribunal de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019obligation de LNC de se renseigner sur les possibles mesures d\u2019adaptation a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9e, si elle s\u2019est renseign\u00e9e, si elle a pris des mesures d\u2019adaptation en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ou si elle a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ces obligations. Mme White affirme que [traduction] \u00ab seul le harc\u00e8lement signal\u00e9 \u00bb est pertinent quant aux questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et non pas le moindre incident qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas signal\u00e9 ou fait conna\u00eetre \u00e0 son employeur. Enfin, Mme White soutient que la demande de LNC constitue une partie de p\u00eache, vise \u00e0 discr\u00e9diter Mme White et est sp\u00e9culative, et que LNC voulait les notes avant d\u2019apprendre qu\u2019elles portaient sur le harc\u00e8lement.\n[17] \u00c0 mon avis, les notes sont potentiellement pertinentes et doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es. Mme White ne demande pas au Tribunal de tirer des conclusions sur du harc\u00e8lement au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi, et le harc\u00e8lement dont fait \u00e9tat Mme White n\u2019est pas fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite. Toutefois, Mme White all\u00e8gue dans sa plainte que LNC n\u2019a pas tenu compte d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience qui, affirme-t-elle, a \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9e \u2013 ou exacerb\u00e9e \u2013 par du harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail, qui obligeait LNC \u00e0 prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en veillant \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle ne se retrouve pas en pr\u00e9sence de la coll\u00e8gue qui l\u2019avait agress\u00e9e et harcel\u00e9e. Bien qu\u2019elle ait d\u2019abord tenu compte des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de Mme White, LNC soutient qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas sciemment omis de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme White parce qu\u2019elle ne savait pas qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait encore d\u2019importants probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019incident mettant en cause sa coll\u00e8gue.\n[18] En raison de la nature des all\u00e9gations et de la r\u00e9ponse de LNC, je suis d\u2019avis que les notes sur le harc\u00e8lement sont potentiellement pertinentes quant aux questions en litige en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Mme White all\u00e8gue que le harc\u00e8lement a caus\u00e9 sa d\u00e9ficience ou aggrav\u00e9 son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9, et LNC soutient que ce n\u2019est pas le cas, et qu\u2019elle ne pouvait raisonnablement \u00eatre au courant de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 continus ou de l\u2019existence d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Compte tenu de la fa\u00e7on dont la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u2013 la d\u00e9ficience \u2013 est si \u00e9troitement li\u00e9e aux incidents et aux all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail, les notes sont potentiellement pertinentes et doivent \u00eatre produites. Je ne crois pas que la demande constitue une partie de p\u00eache, et LNC a expos\u00e9 les faits l\u2019ayant amen\u00e9e \u00e0 croire que les documents existent et sont pertinents quant aux questions en litige.\n[19] De plus, comme les parties le savent tr\u00e8s bien, les notes ne constituent pas un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve soumis au Tribunal et n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admises en preuve.\nLa demande de Mme White\n[20] Mme White demande au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 LNC de produire [traduction] \u00ab tous les cahiers de notes de 2012 \u00e0 2015 de : Caroline Allen, Marty Kapitan, Andrea Denby, Laura Dykstra, Sandra Faught, Karry LeBlanc, Barry Lamirande, Steven Anderson, Daniel Sullivan et Robert Thistle \u00bb.\n[21] Elle affirme que LNC a divulgu\u00e9 des notes limit\u00e9es de Caroline Allen qui portent sur le signalement du harc\u00e8lement par Mme White, l\u2019agression et les mesures d\u2019adaptation dont elle avait besoin. Mme White affirme \u00e9galement qu\u2019en se pr\u00e9parant \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle a eu des entretiens avec des t\u00e9moins qui travaillaient pour LNC au cours des p\u00e9riodes pertinentes. Elle a appris que [traduction] \u00ab tous les incidents et signalements concernant le harc\u00e8lement, ainsi que la sant\u00e9 et les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme White ont notamment \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s \u00e0 Mme Allen, \u00e0 M. Kapitan, \u00e0 Mme Dykstra et \u00e0 Mme Denby \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9s dans leurs cahiers de notes respectifs \u00bb. Mme White soutient que les superviseurs et les gestionnaires appliquaient \u00e9galement cette pratique consistant \u00e0 tenir un cahier de notes. Selon Mme White, ces notes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies, et LNC n\u2019a jamais fait \u00e9tat de cette pratique et de l\u2019existence de ces cahiers de notes.\n[22] LNC s\u2019oppose \u00e0 cette demande. Elle affirme que la demande de Mme White constitue une partie de p\u00eache, qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas indiqu\u00e9 avec qui elle a eu des entretiens ni \u00e0 quel moment. LNC soutient que l\u2019affirmation voulant que tous les incidents aient \u00e9t\u00e9 consign\u00e9s dans tous les cahiers de notes est absurde \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il est tr\u00e8s peu probable que les t\u00e9moins aient vu chacune des dix personnes dont les cahiers de notes sont demand\u00e9s consigner les d\u00e9tails de tous les incidents de harc\u00e8lement dont Mme White aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime. Enfin, LNC fait valoir qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 tous ses documents au peigne fin plus t\u00f4t dans l\u2019instance et produit tout ce qu\u2019elle pouvait produire. Mme White n\u2019a appuy\u00e9 sa demande sur aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment concret tendant \u00e0 indiquer que les cahiers de notes existent ou contiennent des renseignements pertinents qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 produits.\n[23] Mme White soutient que ces notes sont pertinentes quant aux interactions de ses superviseurs et gestionnaires entre eux et avec d\u2019autres concernant le harc\u00e8lement dont elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime, sa d\u00e9ficience et les pr\u00e9occupations qu\u2019elle-m\u00eame et d\u2019autres personnes disent avoir exprim\u00e9es \u00e0 leurs superviseurs et gestionnaires. Elle soutient que ces renseignements aideront le Tribunal \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la teneur des renseignements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s par Mme White et d\u2019autres personnes \u00e0 ce sujet, vraisemblablement pour aider \u00e0 \u00e9tablir l\u2019obligation de se renseigner et de prendre des mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme White en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Elle soutient qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une demande sp\u00e9culative ni d\u2019une partie de p\u00eache.\n[24] La demande de Mme White est rejet\u00e9e. Comme les parties le savent, l\u2019obligation de divulgation est continue. Si une partie d\u00e9couvre des documents potentiellement pertinents quant aux questions en litige dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, elle est tenue de les divulguer. Mais je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 ordonner la production de trois ann\u00e9es de notes consign\u00e9es dans les cahiers de dix personnes en me fondant sur la d\u00e9claration qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin a pu faire au cours de la pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 ce state avanc\u00e9 de l\u2019instance, notamment parce qu\u2019il n\u2019appara\u00eet pas clairement que les cahiers de notes existent, ou que ce qu\u2019ils contiennent pourra m\u00eame aider le Tribunal dans sa t\u00e2che. La demande est sp\u00e9culative, et je ne vois aucun motif suffisant pour ordonner la production ou une autre recherche dans l\u2019ensemble des documents de LNC en me fondant sur ce que Mme White a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande.\nORDONNANCE\n[25] La demande de LNC est accueillie. Mme White doit fournir une copie \u00e9lectronique lisible des notes demand\u00e9es dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 aux autres parties au plus tard \u00e0 midi, heure de l\u2019Est, le vendredi 13 janvier 2023. Elle doit \u00e9galement envoyer au Tribunal une confirmation indiquant qu\u2019elle a obtemp\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\n[26] Si une partie entend pr\u00e9senter ce document en preuve, elle devra en envoyer une copie au greffe du Tribunal pour inclusion dans le cahier de preuve documentaire conjoint au plus tard le lundi 16 janvier 2023 et j\u2019examinerai la question \u00e0 l\u2019audience, au besoin.\n[27] La demande de Mme White est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJennifer Khurana\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe\n12 janvier 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT2252\/0718\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nStacy White c.

APER\u00c7U [1] Le 2 mars 2023, la Banque Royale du Canada (la \u00ab RBC \u00bb), l\u2019intim\u00e9e, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) pour lui demander :\na)de radier les paragraphes 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 et 23 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante;\nb)d\u2019enjoindre \u00e0 la plaignante de d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 sans les all\u00e9gations se rapportant aux repr\u00e9sailles et\/ou aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements post\u00e9rieurs au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte;\nc)de permettre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la plaignante.\n[2] Le 29 mars 2023, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les parties qu\u2019elle ne se pronon\u00e7ait pas sur la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[3] Le 11 avril 2023, Mme Safia Mohamed, la plaignante, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses arguments en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de la RBC. Elle a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rejeter la requ\u00eate de la RBC, de lui permettre de modifier sa plainte initiale pour y ajouter un acte de repr\u00e9sailles, ou de reprendre la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e et de la joindre \u00e0 la plainte initiale.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [4] Le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de la RBC et d\u00e9clare que les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, d\u00e9crites dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Mohamed d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le 26 novembre 2021, sont incluses dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte initiale de discrimination.\nIII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [5] La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate tranche la question de savoir si le Tribunal doit examiner les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles dans le cadre de la plainte. Pour en d\u00e9cider, le Tribunal doit r\u00e9pondre aux questions suivantes :\na)Quels principes juridiques le Tribunal doit-il appliquer pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision?\nb)Le Tribunal est-il li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante?\nLa Commission a-t-elle re\u00e7u une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des repr\u00e9sailles?\nSi la Commission n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal est-il li\u00e9 par la proc\u00e9dure impos\u00e9e par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice?\nc)La plaignante doit-elle d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des repr\u00e9sailles?\nd)Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question c) est non, faut-il radier certains paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Mohamed?\nIV. ANALYSE A. Quels principes juridiques le Tribunal doit-il appliquer pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision? [6] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Prassad c. Canada (Ministre de l\u2019Emploi et de l\u2019Immigration), 1989 CanLII 131 (CSC), [1989] 1 RCS 560, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, les tribunaux administratifs sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00ab ma\u00eetres chez eux \u00bb. Elle a ajout\u00e9 : \u00ab En l\u2019absence de r\u00e8gles pr\u00e9cises \u00e9tablies par loi ou r\u00e8glement [ce qui est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce], ils [les tribunaux administratifs] fixent leur propre proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 la condition de respecter les r\u00e8gles de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et, dans l\u2019exercice de fonctions judiciaires ou quasi judiciaires, de respecter les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. \u00bb\n[7] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour modifier, clarifier et d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte, pourvu que les autres parties ne subissent aucun pr\u00e9judice (Casler c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2017 TCDP 6, aux par. 7 \u00e0 11 [Casler]; Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Assoc. canadienne des employ\u00e9s de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, 2002 CFPI 776, aux par. 30 et 31).\n[8] Dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer la port\u00e9e de la plainte, le Tribunal peut radier les parties des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions qui d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e l\u00e9gitime d\u2019une plainte. Toutefois, le Tribunal doit exercer son pouvoir \u00ab avec prudence \u00bb et seulement dans les \u00ab cas les plus clairs \u00bb (Richards c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2020 TCDP 27, au par. 86).\n[9] Aux termes du paragraphe 44(3) et de l\u2019article 49 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb ou la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), la Commission ne peut demander au Tribunal d\u2019instruire une plainte qu\u2019une fois qu\u2019elle a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur celle-ci. D\u2019ailleurs, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Cooper c. Canada (Commission des droits de la personne), [1996] 3 RCS 854, au paragraphe 48, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la Loi pr\u00e9voit un processus complet de traitement des plaintes et que la Commission est un rouage essentiel de ce processus.\n[10] Selon la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie (voir, par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions Casler et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Mus\u00e9e canadien des civilisations c. Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada (section locale 70396), 2006 CF 704), la port\u00e9e du litige dont le Tribunal est saisi ne peut introduire une nouvelle plainte qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Commission et qui ne respecte pas la demande de la Commission visant l\u2019instruction de la plainte. Le Tribunal n\u2019a donc pas le pouvoir de se pencher sur une plainte qui n\u2019a pas d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par la Commission ni renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction (voir Cook c. Premi\u00e8re nation d\u2019Onion Lake, 2002 CanLII 61849 (TCDP), [2002] D.C.D.P. no 12 [Cook]). Il faut donc se limiter \u00e0 la plainte, aux d\u00e9cisions de la Commission \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette plainte et, en particulier, \u00e0 la demande qu\u2019elle a adress\u00e9e au Tribunal pour qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte.\n[11] La notion de plainte est n\u00e9anmoins suffisamment large pour \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui englobe toute la port\u00e9e des all\u00e9gations de la partie plaignante (Cook, au par. 11). Une plainte est la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape dans le processus et il est in\u00e9vitable que de nouveaux faits et de nouvelles circonstances soient r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s lors de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission (Casler). La plainte se pr\u00e9cise au fur et \u00e0 mesure que le processus se d\u00e9roule (Gaucher c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2005 TCDP 1, au par. 11 [Gaucher]).\n[12] Toutefois, une limite s\u2019impose lorsque la modification d\u2019une plainte ne peut plus \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme une simple modification, mais qu\u2019elle s\u2019apparente plut\u00f4t \u00e0 une nouvelle plainte (Gaucher). De m\u00eame, les all\u00e9gations de faits que le Tribunal doit examiner pour trancher le litige doivent, en quelque sorte, \u00e9maner de la plainte elle-m\u00eame ou en d\u00e9couler, \u00e0 la lecture de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante, et ne doivent pas s\u2019en \u00e9carter de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 constituer une nouvelle plainte.\nB. Le Tribunal est-il li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 la plaignante? [13] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure que l\u2019agente de la Commission, Mme Kellie Leclerc, a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Mohamed au sujet de l\u2019ajout des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles dans sa plainte initiale.\n[14] Le 28 mars 2019, au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de Mme Leclerc sur la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 26 novembre 2018, Mme Mohamed a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\n[15] \u00c0 la suite de son cong\u00e9diement, Mme Mohamed a fait part \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 Mme Leclerc de son intention de formuler des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. Mme Leclerc a toujours r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme Mohamed qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des actes de repr\u00e9sailles pour que la Commission examine la question de savoir si son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait une mesure de repr\u00e9sailles. Elle lui a dit qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas soumettre la question \u00e0 la Commission en modifiant sa plainte initiale.\n[16] Par exemple, le 13 f\u00e9vrier 2020, Mme Leclerc a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une note au dossier, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un appel \u00e0 Mme Mohamed, dans laquelle elle a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction] J\u2019ai appel\u00e9 la plaignante \u00e0 la suite de son courriel et je lui ai laiss\u00e9 un message vocal pour l\u2019informer que je communiquerais avec son avocat, comme elle l\u2019avait demand\u00e9, qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9poser une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles fond\u00e9e sur son cong\u00e9diement de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re plainte et que je ne pouvais pas simplement modifier son formulaire de plainte.\nJe lui ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019elle disposait d\u2019un an pour ce faire, et, comme la lettre de cong\u00e9diement indiquait que son emploi avait pris fin en mars 2019, j\u2019ai insist\u00e9 sur le fait qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9poser une plainte rapidement, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant (\u2026)\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[17] Le 18 f\u00e9vrier 2020, Mme Leclerc a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me note au dossier dans laquelle elle a donn\u00e9 les m\u00eames directives sur la proc\u00e9dure apr\u00e8s avoir parl\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de Mme Mohamed.\n[18] Le 24 mars 2020, Mme Mohamed a envoy\u00e9 une lettre, sign\u00e9e par son avocat, \u00e0 la Commission. Dans cette lettre, il est indiqu\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Transmise par courriel : complaint.plainte@chrc-ccdp.gc.ca.\u00bb Il y est mentionn\u00e9 \u00e9galement : [traduction] \u00ab Je suis l\u2019avocat de Safia Mohamed. Veuillez trouver ci-joint le formulaire de plainte d\u00fbment sign\u00e9 et l\u2019annexe A dont nous demandons respectueusement le d\u00e9p\u00f4t \u00bb.\n[19] L\u2019Annexe A est r\u00e9dig\u00e9e ainsi :\n[traduction] 1. Je d\u00e9pose une autre plainte contre la Banque Royale du Canada (RBC) pour m\u2019avoir cong\u00e9di\u00e9e, lequel cong\u00e9diement constitue un acte de repr\u00e9sailles pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ma plainte initiale, du harc\u00e8lement et de la discrimination. Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements mentionn\u00e9s ci-dessous se sont produits apr\u00e8s que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab CCDP \u00bb) a accept\u00e9 ma plainte portant le num\u00e9ro de dossier 20181286, dat\u00e9e du 25 novembre 2018. Au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de ma plainte, j\u2019\u00e9tais une employ\u00e9e de la RBC, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 mon cong\u00e9diement ill\u00e9gal le 28 mars 2019.\n(\u2026)\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[20] Le 24 novembre 2020, Mme Leclerc a recommand\u00e9 que la Commission renvoie la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Dans son rapport joint \u00e0 la recommandation, elle a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\n(\u2026)\n122. Elle [Mme Mohamed] all\u00e8gue que son cong\u00e9diement par l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait un acte de repr\u00e9sailles en violation de la Loi, parce qu\u2019elle s\u2019est plainte au sujet de la fa\u00e7on dont ses gestionnaires la traitaient et qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Toutefois, elle n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte de repr\u00e9sailles aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Si la Commission adopte la recommandation formul\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent rapport, les circonstances du cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante pourront \u00eatre incluses dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal.\n(\u2026)\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[21] Le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2021, Mme Leclerc a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 une troisi\u00e8me note au dossier :\nJ\u2019ai laiss\u00e9 un message vocal \u00e0 Mme Mohamed pour lui confirmer que les deux parties b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient d\u2019une prorogation de d\u00e9lai pour d\u00e9poser leurs observations concernant la communication r\u00e9ciproque et pour l\u2019aviser qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas d\u00e9poser de plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, comme nous en avions discut\u00e9, car elle n\u2019a pas rempli son formulaire de plainte \u00e0 temps et qu\u2019il est maintenant trop tard pour le faire.\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[22] Le 19 mai 2021, la Commission (le vice-pr\u00e9sident et le commissaire) a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Dans sa d\u00e9cision, la Commission a mentionn\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n(\u2026)\nL\u2019agente n\u2019a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 que sur les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi, ce qui \u00e9tait suffisant pour recommander le renvoi au Tribunal.\n(\u2026)\n[Non soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.]\n[23] Le 20 mai 2021, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019instruire la plainte. Dans sa lettre, la Commission n\u2019a pas impos\u00e9 quelque restriction que ce soit au renvoi de la plainte. La Commission a conclu que les all\u00e9gations ayant fait l\u2019objet de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de Mme Leclerc \u00e9taient suffisantes pour demander au Tribunal qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019instruction.\n[24] Il est \u00e9tabli en droit que la Commission n\u2019est pas tenue d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur chaque all\u00e9gation pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 que le Tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction (voir Casler). En effet, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, c\u2019est ce qui ressort de la d\u00e9cision du 19 mai 2021 de la Commission ou de sa lettre du 20 mai 2021 au pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal. De plus, c\u2019est aussi ce qui ressort de la recommandation formul\u00e9e par Mme Leclerc le 24 novembre 2020 \u00e0 la Commission : \u00ab Si la Commission adopte la recommandation formul\u00e9e dans le pr\u00e9sent rapport, les circonstances du cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante pourront \u00eatre incluses dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal \u00bb. Le Tribunal comprend qu\u2019en mentionnant le \u00ab cong\u00e9diement \u00bb de Mme Mohamed, Mme Leclerc faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, par d\u00e9duction n\u00e9cessaire, aux all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles que Mme Mohamed souhaitait inclure dans sa plainte.\n[25] Pour d\u00e9terminer si le Tribunal est li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure donn\u00e9es par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission \u00e0 la plaignante, il faut d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, si une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des repr\u00e9sailles a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\n(i) La Commission a-t-elle re\u00e7u une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des repr\u00e9sailles? [26] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve probant que la plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de Mme Mohamed, a \u00e9t\u00e9 effectivement re\u00e7ue par la Commission.\n[27] D\u2019une part, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrent qu\u2019une lettre de l\u2019avocat de Mme Mohamed adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9e par courriel \u00e0 l\u2019adresse courriel de la Commission pour la r\u00e9ception des plaintes. D\u2019autre part, Mme Leclerc, qui enqu\u00eatait toujours sur la plainte initiale en mars 2020, n\u2019a pas mentionn\u00e9 dans ses communications ult\u00e9rieures que la Commission avait re\u00e7u une deuxi\u00e8me plainte.\n[28] De plus, le 24 novembre 2021, l\u2019avocate de la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Il n\u2019y a aucune mention du fait que la plaignante a formul\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[29] Le 26 novembre 2021, l\u2019avocate de la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa liste de divulgation de documents, qui ne comprenait pas la deuxi\u00e8me plainte qui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019avocat de Mme Mohamed le 24 mars 2020.\n[30] L\u2019avocat de la RBC mentionne que la RBC n\u2019a jamais re\u00e7u de renseignements concernant la plainte du 24 mars 2020.\n[31] Qu\u2019est-il arriv\u00e9 \u00e0 la plainte du 24 mars 2020?\n[32] Sachant qu\u2019en mars 2020, la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19 est survenue et que plusieurs entreprises et bureaux gouvernementaux n\u2019offraient pas leurs services \u00e0 un niveau optimal, il est possible qu\u2019une erreur administrative se soit produite.\n[33] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne peut trancher la question de savoir si la Commission a re\u00e7u la plainte du 24 mars 2020, mais il peut conclure que la Commission n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des repr\u00e9sailles.\n(ii) Si la Commission n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 une plainte de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal est-il li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure impos\u00e9es par l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice? [34] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, Mme Leclerc a indiqu\u00e9 dans son rapport du 24 novembre 2020 que les circonstances du cong\u00e9diement de la plaignante (dont les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles) pourraient \u00eatre incluses dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte par le Tribunal si la Commission choisissait d\u2019adopter les recommandations qu\u2019elle avait formul\u00e9es dans son rapport.\n[35] En revanche, elle a dit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 Mme Mohamed qu\u2019elle devait d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte dans les 12 mois suivant son cong\u00e9diement pour formuler des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles. Mme Leclerc a inform\u00e9 Mme Mohamed qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas modifier sa plainte de discrimination initiale pour y ajouter ces all\u00e9gations et, le 19 f\u00e9vrier 2021, elle lui a dit qu\u2019il \u00e9tait trop tard pour le faire.\n[36] Dans sa requ\u00eate, la RBC soutient que, dans la mesure o\u00f9 Mme Mohamed n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de plainte de repr\u00e9sailles distincte comme l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice de la Commission lui avait expliqu\u00e9, elle ne peut pas ajouter d\u2019all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles \u00e0 la plainte dont le Tribunal est actuellement saisi.\n[37] Le Tribunal rejette l\u2019argument de la RBC. Selon la jurisprudence bien \u00e9tablie, la Commission n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e par la recommandation de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur. La Commission a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de demander au Tribunal qu\u2019il proc\u00e8de \u00e0 une instruction m\u00eame si l\u2019enqu\u00eateur a recommand\u00e9 dans son rapport le rejet de la plainte. (Jorge c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2021 TCDP 25, au par. 192 (Jorge); Prior c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1983 CanLII 4692 (TCDP). De plus, dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Jorge, le Tribunal \u00e9tablit une distinction entre la \u00ab Commission \u00bb qui rend une d\u00e9cision (les personnes nomm\u00e9es pour si\u00e9ger \u00e0 la Commission conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 26 de la Loi) et le personnel ou les employ\u00e9s de la Commission, dont les enqu\u00eateurs. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e par le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[38] Comme la Commission n\u2019est pas li\u00e9e par le rapport de l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice, le Tribunal estime d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure que Mme Leclerc a donn\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Mohamed.\nC. La plaignante doit-elle d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte all\u00e9guant des repr\u00e9sailles? [39] Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que Mme Mohamed d\u00e9pose une nouvelle plainte pour formuler des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles.\n[40] Non seulement le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les directives sur la proc\u00e9dure donn\u00e9es par Mme Leclerc (concernant l\u2019obligation de d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte), comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, mais cette obligation n\u2019est pas non plus consacr\u00e9e par la jurisprudence \u00e9tablie.\n[41] Dans le contexte d\u2019all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, le Tribunal a admis qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab ne serait pas pratique, efficace et juste \u00bb d\u2019exiger qu\u2019un plaignant d\u00e9pose une plainte distincte, car cela l\u2019obligerait \u00e0 retourner au bout de la file pour qu\u2019il y ait enqu\u00eate, conciliation et d\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de questions qui sont fondamentalement li\u00e9es \u00e0 une plainte en cours (Bressette c. Conseil de bande de la Premi\u00e8re nation de Kettle et Stony Point, 2004 TCDP 2, au par. 6 [Bressette]; Tabor c. La Premi\u00e8re nation Millbrook, 2013 TCDP 9; Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2018 TCDP 2).\n[42] Comme il est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Virk c. Bell Canada, 2004 TCDP 10, au paragraphe 7, en r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, on devrait autoriser une modification visant \u00e0 ajouter des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, \u00e0 moins qu\u2019il soit manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations vis\u00e9es par la demande de modification n\u2019ont aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es.\n[43] Ainsi qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Bressette (au par. 6), lorsque le Tribunal est appel\u00e9 \u00e0 analyser la port\u00e9e de la plainte pour d\u00e9cider s\u2019il doit examiner les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles, il ne devrait pas s\u2019engager dans un examen approfondi du bien-fond\u00e9 de ces all\u00e9gations.\n[44] De plus, il ressort de la jurisprudence (voir \u00e0 titre d\u2019exemple la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Letnes c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2019 TCDP 41) que le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer pour trancher la question de l\u2019ajout d\u2019all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles exige l\u2019examen des trois questions suivantes :\nsi les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont, de par leur nature, li\u00e9es, du moins par le plaignant, aux all\u00e9gations qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale;\nsi les all\u00e9gations peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme soutenables;\nsi un avis suffisant a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e afin de ne pas lui causer pr\u00e9judice et de lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre ad\u00e9quatement.\n[45] Le premier volet du crit\u00e8re d\u00e9fini dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Letnes est rempli.\n[46] En effet, les paragraphes en cause dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Mohamed sont les paragraphes 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 et 23. Ces paragraphes portent sur des actes de repr\u00e9sailles que la RBC aurait commis \u00e0 la suite du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte initiale aupr\u00e8s de la Commission. Ils indiquent que son cong\u00e9diement \u00e9tait li\u00e9 au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[47] Mme Mohamed a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte le 26 novembre 2018. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e le 28 mars 2019.\n[48] Les all\u00e9gations de discrimination qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale sont fond\u00e9es sur le fait que Mme Mohamed s\u2019est vu refuser des promotions et des possibilit\u00e9s de formation professionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019interne. Elle all\u00e8gue \u00e9galement que plusieurs gestionnaires ont fait des commentaires discriminatoires \u00e0 son \u00e9gard et qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de harc\u00e8lement pendant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en poste. Elle all\u00e8gue en outre que la RBC n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ses besoins en refusant de lui fournir un poste de travail ergonomique, comme l\u2019avait recommand\u00e9 son m\u00e9decin. Elle a \u00e9galement ajout\u00e9 que certains gestionnaires ont port\u00e9 de fausses accusations d\u2019actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, ce qui peut \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme des actes discriminatoires, et ont fait des gestes \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel inappropri\u00e9s.\n[49] Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles formul\u00e9es dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions mentionnent des actes d\u2019intimidation de la part de directeurs et de repr\u00e9sentants de la RBC ainsi que de fausses mesures disciplinaires.\n[50] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que le premier volet du crit\u00e8re d\u00e9fini dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Letnes est rempli, car les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont de m\u00eame nature que celles qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte initiale. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, ces all\u00e9gations semblent s\u2019inscrire dans un continuum \u00e9tabli dans les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte initiale. Il y a un lien entre les deux ensembles d\u2019all\u00e9gations.\n[51] Le deuxi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re est aussi rempli, car, si ces all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont prouv\u00e9es, les actes vis\u00e9s pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme une violation de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi, qui dispose :\n14.1 Constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait, pour la personne vis\u00e9e par une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au titre de la partie III, ou pour celle qui agit en son nom, d\u2019exercer ou de menacer d\u2019exercer des repr\u00e9sailles contre le plaignant ou la victime pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e.\n[52] Les all\u00e9gations de Mme Mohamed pourraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es si elles sont prouv\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Elles ne sont pas vou\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chec comme ce fut le cas dans l\u2019affaire Temate c. Agence de sant\u00e9 publique du Canada, 2022 TCDP 31. Dans cette affaire, les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles se rapportaient \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte initiale et qui ne pouvaient donc pas d\u00e9couler du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. La situation est manifestement diff\u00e9rente en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, car Mme Mohamed all\u00e8gue que les actes de repr\u00e9sailles, dont son cong\u00e9diement, sont survenus apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte initiale. Les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles sont donc d\u00e9fendables et soutenables.\n[53] Quant au troisi\u00e8me volet du crit\u00e8re, rien ne prouve que la RBC pourrait subir un pr\u00e9judice vu l\u2019\u00e9tape du processus \u00e0 laquelle la plainte est rendue. Le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 la RBC un avis suffisant afin de ne pas lui causer pr\u00e9judice et de lui permettre de se d\u00e9fendre convenablement dans les circonstances. Les dates d\u2019audience n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es et le Tribunal est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 permettre \u00e0 la RBC de modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin de prendre en compte les all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles de Mme Mohamed. La RBC a donc la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments et de d\u00e9fendre sa th\u00e8se comme l\u2019exigent les principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\nD. Si la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la question c) est non, faut-il radier certains paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Mohamed? [54] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les paragraphes 1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18 et 23 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Mohamed contiennent des all\u00e9gations de repr\u00e9sailles qui sont incluses dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte initiale de discrimination, le Tribunal conclut que ces paragraphes ne doivent pas \u00eatre radi\u00e9s.\nV. CONCLUSION Pour ces motifs, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de la RBC.\nVI. ORDONNANCE Le Tribunal ordonne ce qui suit :\nL\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de Mme Mohamed demeure intact; La RBC peut modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019y inclure des \u00e9l\u00e9ments li\u00e9s aux repr\u00e9sailles all\u00e9gu\u00e9es par Mme Mohamed; La RBC dispose d\u2019un mois suivant la r\u00e9ception de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate pour modifier son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9; Mme Mohamed dispose de 15 jours suivant la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la RBC pour d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9plique; La Commission dispose de 15 jours suivant la r\u00e9ception de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la RBC pour d\u00e9poser sa r\u00e9plique.\nSign\u00e9e par\nMarie Langlois\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 8 juin 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2666\/4221\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause :\nSafia Mohamed c.

(1985), ch. H-6 (LCDP) et aux R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137 (R\u00e8gles de pratique).\n[2] Puisque l\u2019article 48.9 de la LCDP exige qu\u2019une audience soit tenue \u00ab sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb, je conviens qu\u2019il est juste et plus efficace d\u2019examiner la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate sur la base des observations \u00e9crites et de rendre ensuite une d\u00e9cision orale, ce que je ferai maintenant. Je vous remercie tous pour les observations utiles que vous avez pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, et que j\u2019ai examin\u00e9es attentivement.\n[3] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Commission lorsqu\u2019elles d\u00e9clarent que la requ\u00eate des plaignants \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une demande de r\u00e9ouverture de leur dossier parce qu\u2019ils demandent de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires apr\u00e8s que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 les siens. Bien que la requ\u00eate soit faite avant que les plaignants n\u2019aient officiellement ferm\u00e9 leur dossier, il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une demande de d\u00e9couper l\u2019audience. Par cons\u00e9quent, les affaires dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi dans lesquelles cela s\u2019est produit se distinguent.\n[4] Le pr\u00e9sent dossier se distingue aussi des autres affaires dont le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi dans lesquelles il y avait des demandes de r\u00e9ouverture, y compris des affaires r\u00e9centes comme Dorais c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2023 TCDP 6 (CanLII) [Dorais] et Marshall c. Premi\u00e8re Nation de Membertou, 2021 TCDP 36 (CanLII) [Marshall].\n[5] En bref, dans Dorais, l\u2019audience \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e, les observations finales avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et le membre commen\u00e7ait ses d\u00e9lib\u00e9rations lorsque le plaignant a demand\u00e9 de rouvrir le dossier pour pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. La requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Dans ce cas-ci, je n\u2019ai pas commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9lib\u00e9rer.\n[6] Dans Marshall, le dossier du plaignant \u00e9tait complet lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en non-lieu qui a men\u00e9 le plaignant \u00e0 demander la r\u00e9ouverture de son dossier pour t\u00e9moigner. Dans ce cas-ci, le Tribunal a permis au plaignant de finir de pr\u00e9senter son dossier avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne produise sa preuve afin d\u2019\u00e9viter une erreur judiciaire. Dans le cas pr\u00e9sent, il n\u2019est pas question d\u2019un non-lieu.\n[7] Ici, la requ\u00eate est faite parce que les avocates des plaignants ont mal compris la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Elles ont cru \u00e0 tort que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant les r\u00e9parations ne seraient entendus qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal ait conclu qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. Les plaignants soutiennent qu\u2019ils ne doivent pas \u00eatre p\u00e9nalis\u00e9s parce que leurs avocates ont mal compris.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9e ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 ce que les plaignants pr\u00e9sentent des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant les r\u00e9parations, mais elle soutient qu\u2019elle ne doit produire ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019une fois que les plaignants auront termin\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter les leurs. Elle affirme qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de la seule mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable de proc\u00e9der du point de vue de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[9] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a raison de dire que la LCDP et les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal sont structur\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9ponde aux dossiers du plaignant et de la Commission. Elle a aussi raison d\u2019affirmer que la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019un dossier n\u2019a lieu que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles et que la jurisprudence du Tribunal appuie cette affirmation (notamment les affaires Dorais et Marshall).\n[10] Les plaignants ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de \u00ab r\u00e9ouverture \u00bb en question avant de vraiment clore leur dossier. Ils ne veulent pas ajourner l\u2019audience pour maintenir leur dossier ouvert afin de produire les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en question avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne commence \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter les siens, ce que souhaite l\u2019intim\u00e9e, parce que cela entra\u00eenera vraisemblablement un retard important. M\u00eame si le fait de donner droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des plaignants, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, donnera aussi lieu \u00e0 un retard, les plaignants sont pr\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019accepter afin d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leur cause.\n[11] Puisque je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e et la Commission que la requ\u00eate est une demande de r\u00e9ouverture du dossier des plaignants apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je reconnais que les facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Dorais s\u2019appliquent pour d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019instruction du dossier doit \u00eatre rouverte afin de permettre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires avant que le Tribunal ne rende sa d\u00e9cision finale. Pour rendre la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, j\u2019ai analys\u00e9 chaque \u00e9tape.\n[12] Je constate que, dans l\u2019affaire Dorais, la premi\u00e8re question qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur doit se poser a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e ainsi : \u00ab La preuve, si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, changerait-elle vraisemblablement le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction de la plainte? \u00bb. Bien que cette formulation s\u2019applique aux affaires o\u00f9 l\u2019audience est achev\u00e9e et la d\u00e9cision n\u2019est pas encore rendue, comme dans Dorais, ou aux affaires dans lesquelles le tribunal de premi\u00e8re instance a d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu sa d\u00e9cision (ce qui \u00e9tait le cas dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de principe de la Cour supr\u00eame 671122 Ontario Ltd. c. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc., 2001 CSC 59 [CanLII]), je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que la question plus appropri\u00e9e dans un dossier comme celui-ci, o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t dans la proc\u00e9dure, est celle qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Varco Canada Limited c. Pason Systems Corp., 2011 CF 467 (CanLII) [Varco] au paragraphe 23 : les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, s\u2019ils \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, pourraient-ils influencer le r\u00e9sultat? Autrement dit, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sont-ils pertinents?\n[13] Ici, j\u2019estime que la r\u00e9ponse est oui. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires propos\u00e9s semblent \u00eatre cruciaux pour une question cl\u00e9 en litige, celle de l\u2019octroi possible de r\u00e9parations d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public si le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. L\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne que les plaignants n\u2019ont pas, en fait, pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 en quoi consistent les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019ils cherchent \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, et elle affirme qu\u2019il leur incombe de le faire, et que, sauf la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, ils ont clos leur dossier. La Gendarmerie royale du Canada (GRC) indique qu\u2019il ne suffit pas de sugg\u00e9rer qu\u2019ils trouveront des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires. Je suis en d\u00e9saccord, mais je reviendrai sur cette question plus loin dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\n[14] La deuxi\u00e8me question indiqu\u00e9e dans Dorais est la suivante : \u00ab La preuve pouvait-elle \u00eatre obtenue avant l\u2019instruction de la plainte en exer\u00e7ant une diligence raisonnable? \u00bb. \u00c0 premi\u00e8re vue, la r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette question est \u00e9galement oui. Les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es \u00e9taient \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 92, 97, 99 et 100 \u00e0 105 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des plaignants et sont donc \u00ab en jeu \u00bb depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. J\u2019accepte aussi que le d\u00e9faut de pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant les r\u00e9parations s\u2019explique par une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal de la part des avocates. Dans Marshall, il est indiqu\u00e9 que \u00ab [l]es parties sont habituellement li\u00e9es par les actes de leurs repr\u00e9sentants et par les positions qu\u2019ils adoptent \u00bb.\n[15] La troisi\u00e8me question est la suivante : \u00ab Existe-t-il des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin d\u2019admettre de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve? \u00bb. Dans Varco, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 cette question au crit\u00e8re \u00e0 deux volets pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a des circonstances exceptionnelles qui justifieraient d\u2019annuler le crit\u00e8re de la \u00ab diligence raisonnable \u00bb ou tout au moins de r\u00e9duire son importance globale dans l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[16] Ici, \u00e0 mon avis, c\u2019est le cas. Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Commission lorsqu\u2019elle affirme qu\u2019il y a des circonstances extraordinaires dans l\u2019instruction du pr\u00e9sent dossier, qui traite de questions touchant les relations entre les Autochtones, leurs communaut\u00e9s et la GRC, l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les plaintes d\u2019abus historiques et les r\u00e9parations devant \u00eatre accord\u00e9es s\u2019il est conclu qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, bien que les plaignants aient \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s bien repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s (contrairement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019avait conclu le Tribunal dans Marshall), j\u2019estime que, malheureusement, il arrive que des erreurs se produisent, et qu\u2019une approche trop formaliste et rigide ne cadre pas avec les objectifs globaux de la LCDP et le contexte de l\u2019affaire.\n[17] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la Commission lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que, dans les circonstances de l\u2019affaire, il est essentiel de s\u2019assurer que les plaignants ont la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de s\u2019exprimer et que la question est r\u00e9gl\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on rapide.\n[18] Enfin, je dois examiner la question r\u00e9siduelle du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 chaque partie. Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te, la GRC ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, mais elle demande que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e afin que les plaignants pr\u00e9sentent d\u2019abord tous leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Je dois tenir compte \u00e0 la fois du pr\u00e9judice qui serait caus\u00e9 aux plaignants si j\u2019accepte la proposition de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce qui retarderait l\u2019audience, et du pr\u00e9judice qui serait caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la GRC si je retiens la proposition des plaignants. L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale exige que les parties sachent \u00e0 quoi s\u2019en tenir. Bien entendu, je prends ce principe au s\u00e9rieux.\n[19] Il est \u00e9vident que les plaignants subiraient un pr\u00e9judice s\u2019ils ne sont pas autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 produire le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert li\u00e9 aux r\u00e9parations d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Ce point n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9.\n[20] En revanche, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme qu\u2019elle subira un pr\u00e9judice injuste si la requ\u00eate des plaignants est accord\u00e9e. J\u2019ai soigneusement examin\u00e9 les pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et je r\u00e9pondrai \u00e0 chacune d\u2019entre elles.\n[21] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e dit que, si la requ\u00eate des plaignants est accord\u00e9e, la GRC sera oblig\u00e9e de pr\u00e9senter son dossier sans savoir \u00e0 quoi s\u2019en tenir. Elle soutient que la structure propos\u00e9e de l\u2019audience est [traduction] \u00ab intrins\u00e8quement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00bb puisque son dossier entrecroise les faits, la nature du service et les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es. Je constate que le pr\u00e9judice est att\u00e9nu\u00e9 par la connaissance de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture avant que la GRC ne pr\u00e9sente son dossier, contrairement \u00e0 d\u2019autres affaires dans lesquelles tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9taient d\u00e9pos\u00e9s, les observations finales \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es et une partie \u00e9tait prise par surprise par une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ouverture. De plus, puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une question distincte li\u00e9e \u00e0 un type de r\u00e9parations, le pr\u00e9judice peut \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 en permettant \u00e0 la GRC de r\u00e9pondre, de pr\u00e9senter ses propres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de rappeler ses t\u00e9moins, au besoin. Autrement dit, je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que l\u2019intim\u00e9e sera g\u00ean\u00e9e de quelque mani\u00e8re que ce soit dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation principale de discrimination si j\u2019accorde la requ\u00eate.\n[22] Deuxi\u00e8mement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, si les plaignants sont autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 soumettre d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s qu\u2019ils ont ferm\u00e9 leur dossier, cela leur permettrait de pr\u00e9senter de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la d\u00e9fense de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, ce qui les avantagerait injustement. La GRC affirme que les questions juridiques et factuelles de l\u2019affaire sont complexes et s\u2019\u00e9tendent sur une p\u00e9riode de plus de 50 ans. Elle soutient que ces questions ne peuvent pas \u00eatre bien s\u00e9par\u00e9es et compartiment\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 distinguer des autres questions en litige les r\u00e9parations revendiqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des plaignants.\n[23] Les plaignants affirment que leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires ne concerneront que les r\u00e9parations; ils ne proposent pas de pr\u00e9senter d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la question de la responsabilit\u00e9 au cours du processus vis\u00e9. J\u2019estime que cette pr\u00e9occupation est att\u00e9nu\u00e9e par le fait que des objections \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve propos\u00e9s peuvent encore \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es si ceux-ci touchent des questions autres que les r\u00e9parations sp\u00e9cifiques. J\u2019en tiendrai compte, et je serai ouverte \u00e0 tout argument avanc\u00e9 \u00e0 ce titre.\n[24] Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a cru, jusqu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e, que le dossier des plaignants serait ferm\u00e9 avant que la GRC ne commence \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter le sien (puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agit du d\u00e9roulement normal). Elle n\u2019avait aucune raison de croire le contraire et elle s\u2019est appuy\u00e9e sur cette supposition pour d\u00e9terminer comment pr\u00e9senter son dossier. Vu l\u2019\u00e9tat d\u2019avancement de la proc\u00e9dure en cours, la GRC affirme ne pas pouvoir restructurer son dossier maintenant de la mani\u00e8re envisag\u00e9e dans la requ\u00eate. Je reconnais que cette requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sentera certains d\u00e9fis pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, mais je constate aussi que les r\u00e9parations en question sont incluses dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des plaignants depuis juin 2020, ce qui signifie que l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait probablement pr\u00e9par\u00e9 son dossier pour r\u00e9pondre au contenu des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des plaignants et de la Commission. Il ne s\u2019agit pas exactement d\u2019une situation o\u00f9 une partie propose de pr\u00e9senter de \u00ab nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00bb dont personne n\u2019\u00e9tait au courant jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur pr\u00e9sentation. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9, \u00e0 une date tardive, de convoquer un t\u00e9moin suppl\u00e9mentaire qui ne figurait pas sur sa liste de t\u00e9moins et dont les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne concernent pas l\u2019enqu\u00eate, mais plut\u00f4t la fa\u00e7on dont la GRC m\u00e8ne ses enqu\u00eates maintenant. L\u2019intim\u00e9e demande aussi une certaine flexibilit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale en sa faveur; nous pouvons en discuter plus tard.\n[25] La GRC soutient que le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 si les plaignants pouvaient rouvrir leur dossier ne serait pas r\u00e9par\u00e9 en lui donnant l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre. Je suis en d\u00e9saccord.\n[26] La Commission soutient que, dans les circonstances uniques de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019inefficacit\u00e9 potentielle associ\u00e9e \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des plaignants peut \u00eatre pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable aux autres options, qui consistent \u00e0 renoncer aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve propos\u00e9s ou \u00e0 ajourner les dates d\u2019audience afin de retarder le d\u00e9but de la pr\u00e9sentation du dossier de la GRC. Je suis d\u2019accord. Dans ce cas-ci, le Tribunal doit trouver un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019objectif de recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u2013 en donnant \u00e0 toutes les parties, mais surtout aux plaignants en ce qui a trait aux r\u00e9parations pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate, la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur dossier \u2013 et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure rapide et \u00e9quitable.\n[27] Il peut \u00eatre id\u00e9al de permettre aux plaignants de pr\u00e9senter tous leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve avant de demander \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de commencer \u00e0 faire de m\u00eame, mais cela entra\u00eenerait un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire par rapport \u00e0 celui qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 par les plaignants pour leur permettre de pr\u00e9senter leurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires. De plus, les circonstances des plaignants et des t\u00e9moins dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire sont telles que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der rapidement est primordiale.\n[28] Le retard dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu des cons\u00e9quences r\u00e9elles : outre les trois plaignants qui sont d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9s, un t\u00e9moin a eu un accident vasculaire c\u00e9r\u00e9bral apr\u00e8s avoir t\u00e9moign\u00e9 et un autre a indiqu\u00e9 souffrir d\u2019une maladie cardiaque.\n[29] Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 tous les renseignements et tous les facteurs, je conclus que, m\u00eame si un pr\u00e9judice \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e si la requ\u00eate \u00e9tait accord\u00e9e, le pr\u00e9judice que subiraient les plaignants s\u2019ils ne pouvaient pas pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en question et achever l\u2019audience en temps voulu est plus important.\n[30] Nous pouvons proc\u00e9der rapidement et \u00eatre quand m\u00eame justes envers l\u2019intim\u00e9e, m\u00eame si cela signifie qu\u2019elle n\u2019attendra pas pour pr\u00e9senter l\u2019ensemble de son dossier, parce que des protections peuvent \u00eatre mises en place.\n[31] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires que les plaignants souhaitent pr\u00e9senter ne concernent que les r\u00e9parations et, en fait, qu\u2019une seule r\u00e9paration distincte. Ils ont propos\u00e9 de produire, par \u00e9crit, un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert \u00e0 ce sujet, suivi d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire par \u00e9crit. Je ne suis pas pr\u00eat \u00e0 ordonner un contre-interrogatoire \u00e9crit, sauf si toutes les parties sont d\u2019accord, mais nous avons le temps pour d\u00e9terminer le processus. Je n\u2019ai donc pas besoin de me prononcer sur ce point maintenant.\n[32] J\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 qu\u2019un des enjeux est que nous ignorons quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve les plaignants ont r\u00e9ellement l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter, ce qui cause un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Par cons\u00e9quent, je d\u00e9terminerai aussi (comme pour tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve) si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve propos\u00e9s seront recevables et, si ce n\u2019est pas le cas, ils pourront \u00eatre exclus.\n[33] Pour parvenir \u00e0 ma d\u00e9cision, je m\u2019inspire de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Varco, qui a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit au paragraphe 22 :\n\u00c0 mon avis, lorsqu\u2019on regroupe tous les facteurs, crit\u00e8res et points \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, l\u2019importance de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s \u2013 la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 au moyen de la preuve \u2013 est le point primordial \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer.\n[34] Ayant d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de faire droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des plaignants, je suis d\u2019accord avec la majeure partie de la proposition de rechange que l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans ses observations. La GRC a demand\u00e9, comme solution de remplacement, que, si le Tribunal fait droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, il fixe des d\u00e9lais qui donnent suffisamment de temps aux parties pour prendre en compte et r\u00e9pertorier les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires et qui ne causent aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la Commission ou \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a propos\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais, mais je pr\u00e9f\u00e8re pr\u00e9voir une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire ou obtenir les observations \u00e9crites de toutes les parties avant d\u2019\u00e9tablir un tel calendrier.\n[35] Apr\u00e8s examen de toutes les observations et du droit sur la question dont je suis saisi, mon ordonnance est la suivante :\nJe fais droit \u00e0 la requ\u00eate des plaignants visant \u00e0 rouvrir leur dossier relativement \u00e0 la question limit\u00e9e des r\u00e9parations \u00e9nonc\u00e9es aux paragraphes 92, 97, 99 et 100 \u00e0 105 de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions;\nLe Tribunal collaborera avec les parties pour fixer des d\u00e9lais qui leur donneront suffisamment de temps pour se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 cela, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ne causer aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ni \u00e0 la Commission;\nJ\u2019ordonne que tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve des deux segments de l\u2019audience deviennent la preuve dans son ensemble.\n[36] Nous pouvons tenir l\u2019audience aujourd\u2019hui, comme pr\u00e9vu. Si nous avons besoin de jours suppl\u00e9mentaires pour permettre \u00e0 la GRC de finir de pr\u00e9senter son dossier, nous consulterons nos agendas le 22 juin, si nous n\u2019avons pas termin\u00e9 d\u2019ici l\u00e0. Nous pouvons aussi tenir une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire au cours des prochaines semaines, ou je peux recueillir les suggestions \u00e9crites des parties sur la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der relativement aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires que les plaignants ont l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter en ce qui a trait aux d\u00e9lais et \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure.\nSign\u00e9 par\nColleen Harrington\nMembre du Tribunal\nD\u00e9cision orale rendue par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence Zoom lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union de gestion d\u2019instance tenue le 31 mai 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT2459\/1620\nIntitul\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire : Woodgate et al. c.

Contexte de la demande [1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) tranchant la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la plaignante, Mme Laura Nash. Dans sa requ\u00eate, la plaignante demande au Tribunal de citer et de contraindre le retrait\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Jonathan Vance (\u00ab g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00bb) \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner dans le cadre de l\u2019instance et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte, au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[2] La Commission canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) \u00e9tait, dans un premier temps, favorable \u00e0 la demande de Mme Nash. Lorsque des observations additionnelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9es par le Tribunal, la Commission a alors revisit\u00e9 sa position et l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne prenait plus position sur ladite demande. Elle a cependant offert ses commentaires sur les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux que le Tribunal devrait consid\u00e9rer. Quant aux Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (les \u00ab Forces \u00bb), elles se sont fermement oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 la demande de citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre.\n[3] La requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de Mme Nash a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le greffe du Tribunal le vendredi 27 janvier 2023, \u00e0 16 h 01, heure de l\u2019Est. Il s\u2019agissait du jour ouvrable pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, fix\u00e9e du 30 janvier au 22 f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n[4] Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la requ\u00eate au tout dernier instant avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience n\u2019a laiss\u00e9 d\u2019autre choix au Tribunal que de traiter la demande au commencement de l\u2019audience. Cela dit, une autre requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Nash quelques jours auparavant devait \u00eatre entendue par le Tribunal. Les observations sur la requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendues oralement le mardi 31 janvier 2023.\n[5] Dans leurs observations, les Forces ont soulev\u00e9 un argument important sur la notion du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et le Tribunal leur a alors demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser de la jurisprudence au soutien de leurs pr\u00e9tentions. Les parties ont ensuite eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter leurs observations \u00e0 ce sujet. Une fois le tout compl\u00e9t\u00e9, le Tribunal a pris la requ\u00eate en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la matin\u00e9e du 1er f\u00e9vrier 2023.\n[6] Toutefois, le m\u00eame jour, en d\u00e9but d\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, Mme Nash a demand\u00e9 de s\u2019adresser confidentiellement au Tribunal afin de lui fournir des observations additionnelles quant \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance.\n[7] Les parties ont rencontr\u00e9 le Tribunal sans le public afin de discuter d\u2019une mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der. Elles ont toutes consenti \u00e0 ce que Mme Nash fournisse ses informations suppl\u00e9mentaires par affidavit, sous le sceau de la confidentialit\u00e9, ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 par le Tribunal en vertu du paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP. La question a fini par \u00eatre r\u00e9solue plusieurs jours plus tard, le 7 f\u00e9vrier 2023, apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les observations de toutes les parties relativement \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de Mme Nash; le Tribunal a donc pris la requ\u00eate en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ce jour.\n[8] L\u2019audience a suivi son cours, comme pr\u00e9vu. Mme Nash a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 toute sa preuve, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses documents et produit tous ses t\u00e9moins. Le Tribunal devait donc trancher la requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre concernant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance sur-le-champ, pour que la preuve de Mme Nash soit consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme compl\u00e8te.\n[9] Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de Mme Nash et a inform\u00e9 les parties que les motifs suivraient dans une d\u00e9cision \u00e9crite. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision constitue les motifs du Tribunal.\nII. Question en litige [10] Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9cider, au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la LCDP, s\u2019il cite et contraint g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019instance et \u00e0 produire les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte. Pour ce faire, le Tribunal doit tenir compte du fait que la requ\u00eate de Mme Nash a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute, se pencher sur la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et la pertinence du t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance et \u00e9valuer si sa citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre porterait atteinte au principe du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\nIII. D\u00e9cision [11] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate de Mme Nash et refuse de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin dans le cadre de cette instruction.\nIV. Analyse [12] Le Tribunal rappelle qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e0 reprendre tous les arguments formul\u00e9s par les parties. Il analysera la demande en tenant compte des arguments des parties qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaires, essentiels et pertinents afin de rendre sa d\u00e9cision et d\u2019en expliquer les motifs, qui sont transparents, intelligibles et justifi\u00e9s (Turner c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CAF 159, au par. 40; Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration) c. Vavilov, 2019 CSC 65 [Vavilov]).\nA. Position des parties (a) Plaignante [13] Mme Nash a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un grief \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des Forces en f\u00e9vrier 2014 qui concernait des all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe et l\u2019\u00e9tat matrimonial. Ce grief a abouti devant g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance qui \u00e9tait, au moment du grief, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 finale pouvant disposer d\u2019un tel recours. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00e9tait \u00e9galement, au moment du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte de Mme Nash, le chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-Major de la D\u00e9fense au sein des Forces.\n[14] Le Tribunal ne reprendra pas le contenu de la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, rendue le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019, concernant le grief de Mme Nash. Aux fins de cette d\u00e9cision, il faut comprendre que le grief a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9. Cependant, g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance a octroy\u00e9 un montant ex gratia \u00e0 Mme Nash et a mentionn\u00e9 que le grief a port\u00e9 \u00e0 son attention des questions importantes concernant certaines politiques et leur r\u00e9vision potentielle afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 de la composition de la famille et de la vie modernes.\n[15] Mme Nash a demand\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance soit cit\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin afin qu\u2019il puisse t\u00e9moigner de son rapport rendu le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019. Mme Nash a utilis\u00e9 le mot [traduction] \u00ab rapport \u00bb, ce qui n\u2019est pas un d\u00e9tail anodin, et le Tribunal y reviendra plus tard dans cette d\u00e9cision.\n[16] Dans sa requ\u00eate au Tribunal, elle d\u00e9crit le t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[traduction] Retrait\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Jonathan Vance est l\u2019auteur de la R\u00e9ponse Finale du Grief sur les Politiques, qui peut parler sp\u00e9cifiquement de son propre rapport.\n[17] Mme Nash a plaid\u00e9 que ce t\u00e9moignage est pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019instruction de la plainte afin que le Tribunal puisse en disposer. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que la force probante de la preuve qu\u2019il fournira surpasse les effets pr\u00e9judiciables qu\u2019elle subirait si sa requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e.\n[18] Mme Nash a expliqu\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance a \u00e9t\u00e9 directement impliqu\u00e9 dans son dossier parce qu\u2019il a r\u00e9vis\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en lien avec son grief sur les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et qu\u2019il a pris une d\u00e9cision bas\u00e9e sur la r\u00e9vision de son dossier et de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[19] Elle a argu\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance est la seule personne qui peut t\u00e9moigner sur ce rapport et sur les politiques applicables en lien avec ses all\u00e9gations contenues dans son grief. Selon elle, il est la seule personne qui peut t\u00e9moigner sur les politiques des Forces et le harc\u00e8lement subi; il est l\u2019autorit\u00e9 finale en mati\u00e8re de politiques et est celui qui peut demander des changements \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[20] Elle a ajout\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance serait en mesure d\u2019accompagner le Tribunal et d\u2019expliquer son rapport, notamment pr\u00e9ciser pourquoi il avait conclu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de discrimination, exposer les raisons pour lesquelles il a pris autant de temps avant de d\u00e9cider du grief et discuter des suivis qu\u2019il a faits sur les r\u00e9visions des politiques. Mme Nash a affirm\u00e9 que le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant la prise de d\u00e9cision est un enjeu actuel dans sa plainte.\n[21] Elle a confirm\u00e9 au Tribunal ne pas avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de demande de r\u00e9vision judiciaire du rapport de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance et pr\u00e9tend que le t\u00e9moignage de celui-ci n\u2019a pas pour but de prouver la discrimination.\n[22] Elle croit que pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et de justice naturelle, et malgr\u00e9 le retard de sa requ\u00eate, le Tribunal devrait lui accorder. Elle a affirm\u00e9 avoir renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 appeler l\u2019un de ses t\u00e9moins, ce qui lib\u00e8re du temps \u00e0 l\u2019audience, temps qui pourrait \u00eatre allou\u00e9 au t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, ce qui respecte aussi le principe fondamental de la LCDP selon lequel les proc\u00e9dures devraient se d\u00e9rouler de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible.\n[23] Elle croit que le paragraphe 50(3) de la LCDP offre toute la latitude n\u00e9cessaire au Tribunal, qui n\u2019est pas une cour de justice, afin de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure. Elle a plaid\u00e9 que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas une cour de r\u00e9vision et qu\u2019il n\u2019aura pas \u00e0 r\u00e9viser le rapport de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance en ce sens, et que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance pourra pr\u00eater assistance au Tribunal en donnant sa position au regard des Forces et de leurs politiques et pourra t\u00e9moigner sur le long temps qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire afin de rendre son rapport.\n[24] Elle a ajout\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moin est sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la confirmation des individus qui viendraient t\u00e9moigner pour les Forces et dont les noms ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi donn\u00e9s le vendredi avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience.\n[25] Finalement, Mme Nash a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal, en s\u2019appuyant sur son affidavit \u2013 qui est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 \u2013 d\u2019appliquer une approche qui tient compte des traumatismes v\u00e9cus. Ce faisant, il existe, selon elle, et en raison de ses traumatismes, ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale et ses craintes, des raisons pour expliquer pourquoi elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en retard sa requ\u00eate en citation de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin.\n[26] Quant au secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, la plaignante a plaid\u00e9 que le Tribunal pouvait intervenir et lever le voile du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 quant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance. Le Tribunal reviendra sur cet argument plus loin dans sa d\u00e9cision.\n(b) Intim\u00e9e [27] L\u2019un des principaux arguments des Forces est \u00e0 l\u2019effet que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, lorsqu\u2019il a rendu sa d\u00e9cision sur le grief de Mme Nash le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019, agissait alors en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif.\n[28] Elles ont renvoy\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, L.R.C. (1985), ch. N\u20115, (\u00ab LDN \u00bb) qui pr\u00e9voit le processus de d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un grief, l\u2019autorit\u00e9 finale ayant le pouvoir de disposer du grief et le m\u00e9canisme de contestation disponible, soit un contr\u00f4le judiciaire \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[29] Les Forces ont donc plaid\u00e9 qu\u2019il est impossible pour le Tribunal de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin alors qu\u2019il agissait en tant qu\u2019autorit\u00e9 finale du grief de Mme Nash, \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9cideur administratif. Les Forces ont affirm\u00e9 que, si la plaignante n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en accord avec la d\u00e9cision rendue, elle aurait d\u00fb saisir la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Elle aurait pu alors contester la documentation qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9e par le d\u00e9cideur et plaider que la d\u00e9cision n\u2019\u00e9tait pas claire et qu\u2019elle ne respectait pas les exigences minimales d\u2019une d\u00e9cision. Les Forces ont ajout\u00e9 que si Mme Nash avait des inqui\u00e9tudes quant au temps qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance puisse rendre sa d\u00e9cision, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre saisie d\u2019une demande en mandamus, ce qui \u00e9tait le recours appropri\u00e9 disponible \u00e0 ce moment.\n[30] Les Forces ont plaid\u00e9 que les parties n\u2019ont pas un droit \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur ou un juge explique sa d\u00e9cision devant une autre instance. Selon elles, ce que demande Mme Nash, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire de citer un d\u00e9cideur administratif comme t\u00e9moin pour qu\u2019il commente ou explique sa d\u00e9cision, est tout simplement impossible en droit. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif, est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, ce qui prot\u00e8ge son processus d\u00e9cisionnel et sa d\u00e9cision de toute ing\u00e9rence. Les Forces ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9, \u00e0 la demande du Tribunal, de la jurisprudence sur la notion du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[31] Les Forces ont ajout\u00e9 que Mme Nash avait en sa possession la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance depuis f\u00e9vrier 2019 et que sa plainte devant la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e bien avant celle-ci. Elles ont soutenu que Mme Nash n\u2019avait jamais fait valoir que cette d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait source de discrimination ou de harc\u00e8lement et elles estiment que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas saisi de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments. Elles ont affirm\u00e9 que la Commission n\u2019a pas non plus renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal le fait que le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance rende sa d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait lui\u2011m\u00eame discriminatoire.\n[32] Somme toute, les Forces ont plaid\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance n\u2019est pas pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019instruction. Elles avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 annonc\u00e9 depuis longtemps que deux personnes viendraient parler des politiques au sein des Forces. Elles ont argu\u00e9 que Mme Nash n\u2019a jamais partag\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle d\u00e9sirait appeler g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin et que sa demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite \u00e0 la toute derni\u00e8re minute. Une demande si tardive constitue, \u00e0 leur avis, une exp\u00e9dition de p\u00eache voire penche vers l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[33] Finalement, les Forces ont affirm\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance est maintenant retrait\u00e9 et que les avocats qui les repr\u00e9sentent devant le Tribunal ne le repr\u00e9sentent \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci de la proc\u00e9dure. Ainsi, citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin pourrait entra\u00eener une requ\u00eate en cassation de la citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et les cons\u00e9quences qui y sont aff\u00e9rentes.\n[34] Concernant l\u2019affidavit de Mme Nash, les Forces ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de ne pas en tenir compte puisque l\u2019information fournie par Mme Nash n\u2019est pas pertinente. Selon elles, la plaignante a eu maintes occasions de demander au Tribunal de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin, ce qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fait.\n[35] Les Forces ont ajout\u00e9 que Mme Nash est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e depuis des ann\u00e9es dans cette proc\u00e9dure et que ses craintes quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses informations personnelles auraient pu \u00eatre abord\u00e9es avec son avocate.\n[36] Selon les Forces, l\u2019argument de Mme Nash, d\u2019apr\u00e8s lequel la citation de G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin est une r\u00e9ponse au d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif des noms de deux de leurs t\u00e9moins qui devaient parler des politiques, est sans fondement. Les Forces ont r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ont annonc\u00e9 leurs t\u00e9moins depuis 2020 et ont fourni la description de leur t\u00e9moignage. Elles ne devaient que confirmer les noms des personnes qui viendront t\u00e9moigner, ce qui n\u2019affectait pas la nature du t\u00e9moignage comme pr\u00e9vu dans leurs r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignage.\n(c) Commission [37] Comme mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la Commission a revisit\u00e9 sa position durant ses arguments. Dans un premier temps, elle \u00e9paulait la position de la plaignante et plaidait en ce sens.\n[38] Apr\u00e8s que le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 des observations additionnelles sur la question du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, la Commission a finalement r\u00e9vis\u00e9 sa position et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne plus prendre position sur la demande. Elle a plut\u00f4t d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019offrir au Tribunal des observations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur les principes applicables en la mati\u00e8re.\n[39] Vu ce changement inattendu, le Tribunal ne reprendra pas les observations de la Commission qui supportaient alors la position de la plaignante puisqu\u2019elles sont maintenant sans fondement et ne supportent plus sa position actuelle. De toute mani\u00e8re, les observations de la Commission n\u2019avaient rien de nouveau, puisqu\u2019elles \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement reprises par Mme Nash dans ses propres observations.\n[40] Cependant, les observations additionnelles de la Commission sont int\u00e9ressantes et \u00e9clairent tout de m\u00eame le Tribunal. En effet, la Commission a rappel\u00e9 qu\u2019elle joue un r\u00f4le en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaintes qu\u2019elle re\u00e7oit. Dans le cas de Mme Nash, la Commission a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il existait d\u2019autres recours internes \u00e0 sa disposition, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment un processus de r\u00e8glement des griefs au sein des Forces.\n[41] La Commission a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il est pratique courante de d\u00e9f\u00e9rer les plaintes \u00e0 ces autres processus lorsqu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9 et exp\u00e9ditif de le faire, ce qu\u2019elle a fait dans le cas de Mme Nash. Sa plainte a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en suspens le temps qu\u2019elle \u00e9puise ces autres options. Le Tribunal comprend donc que la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance quant au grief de Mme Nash est l\u2019aboutissement de ce processus.\n[42] Cela dit, la Commission a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9activer la plainte \u00e0 la demande de Mme Nash. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue.\n[43] La Commission a rappel\u00e9 que dans son r\u00f4le en mati\u00e8re d\u2019examen des plaintes, elle n\u2019avait pas pour objet de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y avait eu discrimination : son r\u00f4le \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t de transmettre la plainte au Tribunal s\u2019il existait des motifs qui justifiaient le renvoi de la plainte devant celui-ci. De plus, la Commission a ajout\u00e9 que, durant son examen, il y avait \u00e9galement une absence de d\u00e9fense de la part des Forces. Elle a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de transmettre la plainte de Mme Nash au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[44] Compte tenu de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, la Commission a plaid\u00e9 que le t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance est, \u00e0 son avis, potentiellement pertinent tant sur le plan des r\u00e9parations personnelles demand\u00e9es par Mme Nash que sur le plan des r\u00e9parations syst\u00e9miques qui sont demand\u00e9es dans le dossier. Elle estime aussi que le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance rende sa d\u00e9cision est aussi, selon elle, un aspect important du dossier devant le Tribunal.\n[45] Elle a ajout\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance sera en mesure de t\u00e9moigner dans le cadre du dossier et d\u2019offrir de la preuve au Tribunal sans qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire que ce dernier r\u00e9vise judiciairement la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il a rendue en f\u00e9vrier 2019. Selon elle, il existe une diff\u00e9rence entre le r\u00f4le de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif et son autre r\u00f4le au sein des Forces.\n[46] La Commission a argu\u00e9, tout comme la plaignante, que le voile du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 peut \u00eatre lev\u00e9 par le Tribunal et qu\u2019il existe des inqui\u00e9tudes valides quant \u00e0 des failles dans les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle dans le processus de grief menant \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance.\n[47] La Commission a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que l\u2019affidavit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la plaignante pourrait avoir un effet sur la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal quant \u00e0 la demande en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et au retard de son d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Enfin, elle a plaid\u00e9 que les Forces n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elles subiraient de pr\u00e9judice si g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin.\nB. D\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif de la demande et effet pr\u00e9judiciable [48] Le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019\u00e0 lui seul, cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment permet de rejeter la demande de Mme Nash sans motif additionnel.\n[49] L\u2019audience de Mme Nash devait d\u00e9buter le 30 janvier 2023 \u00e0 9 h 30. Le vendredi 27 janvier 2023, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u par courriel la demande de Mme Nash, \u00e0 16 h 01, dans laquelle elle demandait au Tribunal de d\u00e9livrer une citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre pour g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la LCDP.\n[50] Autrement dit, la demande de Mme Nash en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue le jour ouvrable pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, quelques minutes avant la fermeture des bureaux du Tribunal. En soi, une demande si tardive visant \u00e0 citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre un t\u00e9moin est probl\u00e9matique, surtout venant d\u2019une partie repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat.\n[51] Le Tribunal est dot\u00e9 de r\u00e8gles de pratique, \u00ab [\u2026] lesquelles guident les parties relativement \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles doivent faire et \u00e0 ce qui est attendu d\u2019elles, et \u00e9noncent les cons\u00e9quences en cas de non-respect de ces r\u00e8gles \u00bb (Vadnais c. Premi\u00e8re Nation Leq\u2019\u00e1:mel, 2022 TCDP 38 (CanLII), au par. 7 [Vadnais]).\n[52] Les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137 (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb) \u00ab [\u2026] \u00e9tablissent les attentes et guident les parties \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de chaque \u00e9tape de l\u2019instance [\u2026] \u00bb (Vadnais, au par. 8). Elles sont claires : une partie qui entend appeler un t\u00e9moin doit annoncer, \u00e0 l\u2019avance, son intention de le citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et fournir un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage (voir alin\u00e9as 18(1)e), 19(1)d), 20(1)d) et paragraphe 21(2) des R\u00e8gles de pratique).\n[53] Il y a une obligation d\u2019informer en temps opportun les autres parties, et le Tribunal, de ses intentions relativement aux faits qu\u2019elles entendent soulever dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure, aux r\u00e9parations recherch\u00e9es, aux d\u00e9fenses qui seront soulev\u00e9es et aux t\u00e9moins, ordinaires ou experts, qui viendront t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019instance. Un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage doit aussi \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9 (Vadnais, au par. 29).\n[54] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 37b) des R\u00e8gles de pratique est non \u00e9quivoque et pr\u00e9voit sp\u00e9cifiquement la situation o\u00f9 une personne n\u2019aurait pas inform\u00e9 les parties de son intention d\u2019appeler un t\u00e9moin et omettrait de fournir un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage :\n37 Toute partie ne peut :\n[\u2026]\nb) faire t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience que les t\u00e9moins dont elle a donn\u00e9 le nom et pour qui elle a fourni un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9vu, conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles 18, 19, 20 ou 21;\n[Italique ajout\u00e9]\n[55] Autrement dit, si une partie manque \u00e0 son obligation d\u2019annoncer son intention d\u2019appeler un t\u00e9moin ou de fournir un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage en temps opportun, elle ne peut pr\u00e9senter un tel t\u00e9moin \u00e0 l\u2019audience. C\u2019est exactement dans cette situation que Mme Nash s\u2019est retrouv\u00e9e en n\u2019informant pas les parties et le Tribunal en temps opportun, de son intention d\u2019appeler g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance en tant que t\u00e9moin.\n[56] La r\u00e8gle 9 des R\u00e8gles de pratique pr\u00e9voit les cons\u00e9quences au non-respect des r\u00e8gles :\n9 Si une partie omet de se conformer aux pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles, \u00e0 une ordonnance de la formation ou \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles, la formation peut, eu \u00e9gard aux circonstances, de sa propre initiative ou sur requ\u00eate d\u2019une autre partie, ordonner \u00e0 la partie de rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019omission, continuer l\u2019instruction de la plainte, rejeter la plainte ou rendre toute autre ordonnance qui respecte le principe \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 5.\n[Italique ajout\u00e9]\n[57] Cependant, la r\u00e8gle 8 des R\u00e8gles de pratique permet au membre instructeur d\u2019exempter une partie de l\u2019application des R\u00e8gles de pratique dans le cas o\u00f9 l\u2019exemption respecte les principes qui sont \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 5 des R\u00e8gles de pratique.\n[58] La r\u00e8gle 5 des R\u00e8gles de pratique mentionne que :\n5 Les pr\u00e9sentes r\u00e8gles sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre de trancher la plainte sur le fond de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable, informelle et rapide.\n[59] Dans le cas de Mme Nash, elle n\u2019a manifest\u00e9, \u00e0 aucun moment durant les trois ann\u00e9es de gestion de cas, son intention d\u2019appeler g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une toute nouvelle demande, inattendue, faite \u00e0 la fin des heures d\u2019ouverture du Tribunal le jour pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. En retenant cette information, Mme Nash a directement emp\u00each\u00e9 les autres parties de se pr\u00e9parer en cons\u00e9quence et de pouvoir r\u00e9agir \u00e0 une telle demande (Vadnais, au par. 31). Une telle demande tardive ne permet pas non plus au t\u00e9moin, qui pourrait \u00eatre cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, d\u2019avoir raisonnablement le temps de r\u00e9agir \u00e0 une telle citation.\n[60] Le retard de la demande de Mme Nash a aussi in\u00e9vitablement pris le Tribunal par surprise. Cette demande n\u2019a pas pu \u00eatre trait\u00e9e dans le court d\u00e9lai imparti, ce qui n\u2019a laiss\u00e9 d\u2019autre choix au Tribunal que de traiter la demande au tout d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience alors qu\u2019il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup \u00e0 faire, dont le traitement d\u2019une autre requ\u00eate, que Mme Nash a, elle aussi, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 quelques jours avant l\u2019audience.\n[61] Le fait que le Tribunal soit un tribunal administratif et non pas une cour de justice comme le plaide Mme Nash et la Commission \u2013 ce qui lui donnerait la flexibilit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire afin de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance dans les circonstances \u2013 ne lui donne pas non plus carte blanche afin d\u2019\u00e9carter compl\u00e8tement les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Le Tribunal doit respecter sa loi habilitante et ses r\u00e8gles de pratique, comme le prescrit le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP (voir \u00e9galement Vadnais, au par. 6).\n[62] Cela \u00e9tant dit, comme l\u2019a rappel\u00e9 le Tribunal dans Whyte c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2009 TCDP 33, au paragraphe 12, la partie qui d\u00e9pose une demande tardive et qui ne respecte pas les R\u00e8gles de pratique \u00e0 cet effet doit aussi d\u00e9montrer que celle-ci ne porte pas pr\u00e9judice aux autres parties ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (voir \u00e9galement Vadnais, au par. 15). Le Tribunal doit n\u00e9cessairement tenir compte de l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice lorsqu\u2019une partie pr\u00e9sente une demande tardive (Vadnais, au par. 16).\n[63] Mme Nash a fourni des observations additionnelles afin d\u2019expliquer pourquoi elle avait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9poser sa requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin. Ces observations sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9. Le Tribunal ne divulguera pas d\u2019informations de nature d\u00e9licate, mais doit tout de m\u00eame donner du contexte afin que les lecteurs comprennent ses motifs. Il a l\u2019obligation de pr\u00e9senter des motifs qui sont intelligibles, transparents et justifi\u00e9s (Vavilov, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e).\n[64] Il suffit de comprendre que Mme Nash a offert des explications qui justifient, selon elle, le retard de sa demande en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin. Selon ses dires, elle aurait envisag\u00e9 d'appeler ce t\u00e9moin il y a plus d\u2019un an de cela, mais a finalement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas le faire. Elle avait des inqui\u00e9tudes relativement \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 si elle devait l\u2019appeler comme t\u00e9moin.\n[65] Lorsqu\u2019elle a appris tout juste avant l\u2019audience que ses informations personnelles \u2013 adresse, t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, num\u00e9ros d\u2019identification, etc. \u2013 seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, elle a alors envisag\u00e9 d\u2019appeler g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin.\n[66] Elle a ajout\u00e9 que le Tribunal devrait adopter une proc\u00e9dure qui prend en consid\u00e9ration les traumatismes subis par les personnes qui sont impliqu\u00e9es dans le processus. En raison de ses traumatismes v\u00e9cus, de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale, elle avait, plaide-t-elle, des motifs expliquant le retard de sa demande.\n[67] D\u2019une part, le Tribunal est tout \u00e0 fait en accord avec le fait qu\u2019il doit adopter une approche qui prend en compte le traumatisme subis par les parties qui sont impliqu\u00e9es dans sa proc\u00e9dure. Le Tribunal veut tenter de diminuer, au maximum, les traumatismes qui pourraient \u00eatre v\u00e9cus \u2013 ou rev\u00e9cus \u2013 dans le cadre d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure quasi judiciaire comme la sienne. \u00c0 cet effet, le Tribunal tente toujours d\u2019adapter sa proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 chaque circonstance et aux parties qui se pr\u00e9sentent devant lui, tout tenant compte des traumatismes que peuvent avoir v\u00e9cus les participants. Il a toute la flexibilit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire afin de s\u2019assurer que la proc\u00e9dure ait du sens pour ses parties (paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP).\n[68] Une approche qui prend en consid\u00e9ration les traumatismes v\u00e9cus par les personnes impliqu\u00e9es vise \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles sentent que la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal offre un environnement s\u00e9curitaire pour elles. Une telle approche veut que le meilleur soit mis en \u0153uvre afin de minimiser les effets d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure comme la n\u00f4tre sur ces personnes.\n[69] Toutefois, une approche qui prend en consid\u00e9ration les traumatismes ne veut pas dire que les parties et le Tribunal ne doivent pas respecter les principes fondamentaux d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure et de justice naturelle. Le Tribunal y est toujours soumis (paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP). Une telle approche ne r\u00e9duit pas non plus le fardeau qui incombe \u00e0 une partie.\n[70] L\u2019approche fond\u00e9e sur les traumatismes existe en parall\u00e8le de ces principes fondamentaux. Alors, comment pouvons-nous nous assurer que la proc\u00e9dure aura le moins d\u2019effets possibles sur la personne qui a v\u00e9cu un traumatisme? Comment le Tribunal peut-il l\u2019accompagner dans ce cheminement, tout en permettant aux principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019\u00eatre respect\u00e9s, et ce, pour toutes les parties impliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte? Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un travail d\u00e9licat, de toute \u00e9vidence.\n[71] Dans notre cas, le point majeur soulev\u00e9 par Mme Nash dans son affidavit qui est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 est le fait qu\u2019en raison d\u2019un traumatisme et de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale, elle avait des motifs justifiant le retard de sa demande de citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance. Elle avait des craintes quant \u00e0 sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et quant \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 de ses informations. Le Tribunal comprend ce que Mme Nash partage et est d\u00e9sol\u00e9 d\u2019apprendre ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu ainsi que la peur et les inqui\u00e9tudes qu\u2019elle a endur\u00e9es et qu\u2019elle endure toujours.\n[72] Le Tribunal n\u2019a aucun doute sur les \u00e9motions v\u00e9cues par Mme Nash et la remercie de les avoir partag\u00e9es sous le sceau de la confidentialit\u00e9. Cela dit, le dossier officiel du Tribunal d\u00e9montre que la protection des informations personnelles des parties et des individus qui sont impliqu\u00e9s dans le dossier n\u2019est pas quelque chose de nouveau. Les parties et le Tribunal ont abord\u00e9 cette question d\u00e8s le 28 septembre 2022, lors d\u2019une t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance.\n[73] Au-del\u00e0 des craintes de Mme Nash et au-del\u00e0 de son dossier, le Tribunal est toujours conscient du caract\u00e8re public de ses audiences et de la quantit\u00e9 volumineuse de documents qui est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e dans ses dossiers. Ce faisant, beaucoup d\u2019informations personnelles peuvent se retrouver dans la sph\u00e8re publique. Il faut tenter, dans la mesure du possible, de prot\u00e9ger ces informations, surtout lorsqu\u2019elles ne sont pas n\u00e9cessaires ni pour le public ni pour le Tribunal dans l\u2019accomplissement de son mandat qui est de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu discrimination.\n[74] Le sommaire de la t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence du 28 septembre 2022 aborde pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment la question de la protection des informations personnelles des participants dans la pr\u00e9sente instance et pr\u00e9voit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Membre Gaudreault a avis\u00e9 que l\u2019audience est ouverte aux membres du public et a expliqu\u00e9 aux parties qu\u2019il est tr\u00e8s important de retirer les informations personnelles des pi\u00e8ces propos\u00e9es afin de s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elles ne soient pas accidentellement divulgu\u00e9es. Membre Gaudreault a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e si n\u00e9cessaire.\n[75] L\u2019objectif \u00e9tait de s\u2019assurer que les informations personnelles des personnes impliqu\u00e9es dans le dossier, dont celles de Mme Nash, seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es et qu\u2019elles ne se retrouveraient pas dans le domaine public inutilement. Une telle situation prend davantage de sens lorsque l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roule par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence et que les documents sont partag\u00e9s avec tous les participants et peuvent aussi \u00eatre consult\u00e9s par les membres du public. Le Tribunal juge qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun pr\u00e9judice pour le public \u00e0 ne pas avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces informations personnelles.\n[76] Cela dit, Mme Nash n\u2019a malheureusement pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 cet appel, mais son avocate \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sente et \u00e9tait au fait que les informations de sa cliente seraient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de croire que Mme Nash n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de cela, car elle \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e et les sommaires des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance \u00e9taient syst\u00e9matiquement distribu\u00e9es aux parties par le Tribunal.\n[77] Si Mme Nash avait des inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet de ses informations personnelles et si elle avait compris en septembre 2022 que tout allait \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9, le Tribunal et les parties auraient pu aborder la question d\u2019appeler g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin des mois avant l\u2019audience.\n[78] Il est donc triste que Mme Nash n\u2019ait pas entendu l\u2019intervention du Tribunal \u00e0 ce sujet, de vive voix. Elle aurait pu prendre conscience que le Tribunal voulait fondamentalement prot\u00e9ger les informations personnelles de ses participants, dont les siennes, ce qui aurait pu, et le Tribunal l\u2019esp\u00e8re, diminuer son stress, sa peur et ses inqui\u00e9tudes. Ce renseignement aurait pu suffire \u00e0 la rassurer pour qu\u2019elle aborde la question avec le Tribunal et les parties.\n[79] Plusieurs options auraient alors pu \u00eatre explor\u00e9es. Mme Nash aurait pu partager ses inqui\u00e9tudes et ses craintes sous le sceau de la confidentialit\u00e9 comme elle l\u2019a fait \u00e0 l\u2019audience, lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union avec le membre et les autres parties sans la pr\u00e9sence du public, ou durant une proc\u00e9dure de m\u00e9diation-instruction.\n[80] Ultimement, le Tribunal doit consid\u00e9rer que le sujet de la protection des informations personnelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9 plus de quatre mois avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience. Ainsi, il faut conclure que la demande en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de Mme Nash, qui se fonde en grande partie sur sa m\u00e9connaissance de la protection possible de ses informations personnelles, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e tardivement, soit la veille de l\u2019audience quelques minutes avant la fermeture des bureaux. D\u00e9poser une demande importante si tardivement est contraire aux R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal.\n[81] En ce qui concerne l\u2019approche que devrait adopter le Tribunal, soit une approche qui tient compte des traumatismes v\u00e9cus par ses participants, il faut noter que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au fait, en temps opportun, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments soumis par Mme Nash dans son affidavit. De ce fait, le Tribunal n\u2019a donc pas pu intervenir \u00e0 ce sujet et n\u2019a pu prendre les mesures n\u00e9cessaires afin d\u2019accompagner Mme Nash dans ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu et ce qu\u2019elle vivait. Il n\u2019a pas pu adapter la proc\u00e9dure aux circonstances personnelles de la plaignante. Autrement dit, le Tribunal ne peut intervenir sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il n\u2019a aucune connaissance.\n[82] Enfin, Mme Nash a plaid\u00e9 que la force probante de la preuve que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance offrirait au Tribunal surpasse les effets pr\u00e9judiciables qu\u2019elle subirait si sa requ\u00eate en citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e, malgr\u00e9 le retard de celle-ci.\n[83] D\u2019une part, nous verrons plus loin dans l\u2019analyse que le t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, s\u2019il \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin, serait in\u00e9vitablement limit\u00e9, en raison de la nature m\u00eame de son r\u00f4le dans le dossier de Mme Nash et des motifs pour lesquels elle demande qu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne. Ces limitations importantes affectent n\u00e9cessairement la pertinence et l\u2019utilit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage et le Tribunal reviendra sur ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans la section suivante.\n[84] D\u2019autre part, une demande de citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre si tardive aurait in\u00e9vitablement entra\u00een\u00e9 des cons\u00e9quences sur l\u2019audience et son d\u00e9roulement. La Commission a, \u00e0 cet effet, plaid\u00e9 que les Forces n\u2019avaient pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 d\u2019effets pr\u00e9judiciables.\n[85] \u00c0 ce sujet, il faut rappeler qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ardu de trouver des dates communes entre le Tribunal et les cinq avocats au dossier, en plus d\u2019un certain nombre de parajuristes \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ce dossier. L\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9e pour une dur\u00e9e de 18 jours des mois avant son commencement. Compte tenu de cette difficult\u00e9, il fallait imp\u00e9rativement que l\u2019audience d\u00e9bute comme pr\u00e9vu et qu\u2019elle suive son cours, sans interruption. Il faut aussi ajouter que le Tribunal et les parties se sont rapidement rendu compte qu\u2019il manquerait du temps d\u2019audience et que 18 jours ne seraient pas suffisants afin de compl\u00e9ter l\u2019audience.\n[86] De plus, la plaignante a confirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir communiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9alablement avec g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance et ne pas avoir ses informations de contact. C\u2019est donc dire qu\u2019elle a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre un t\u00e9moin dont elle ignore compl\u00e8tement les disponibilit\u00e9s, o\u00f9 il se trouve, voire s\u2019il contesterait sa citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre.\n[87] Si le Tribunal avait cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance avec un si court pr\u00e9avis, il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire de suspendre l\u2019audience le temps que la plaignante puisse entreprendre les d\u00e9marches afin de le retrouver, de lui signifier sa citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, payer ses frais de t\u00e9moin et, possiblement, prendre le temps de le pr\u00e9parer. Tout cela, sans toutefois avoir de garantie que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00e9tait, d\u2019une part, retrouvable, et d\u2019autre part, disponible afin de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience aux dates qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9es des mois avant son commencement. Tout cela aurait d\u00fb se produire dans un espace de temps et avec un pr\u00e9avis que de quelques jours ouvrables, alors que le Tribunal et les parties pr\u00e9paraient ce dossier depuis plusieurs mois, et m\u00eame quelques ann\u00e9es.\n[88] Dans ce cas-ci, l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice sugg\u00e9raient le rejet de la demande, au risque d\u2019interrompre l\u2019audience de 18 jours qui \u00e9tait fix\u00e9e depuis des mois et tous les pr\u00e9paratifs n\u00e9cessaires pour les t\u00e9moins, les avocats, les parajuristes, le Tribunal et son personnel, afin d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00eats \u00e0 proc\u00e9der. La plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de convaincre le Tribunal que le retard du d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une telle demande de citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9 et que l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable pouvait \u00eatre corrig\u00e9, et ce, m\u00eame si elle avait renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 faire t\u00e9moigner son m\u00e9decin.\n[89] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet \u00e9galement l\u2019importance de compl\u00e9ter ce dossier de la mani\u00e8re la plus exp\u00e9ditive possible. Mme Nash a, par ailleurs, manifest\u00e9 \u00e0 de multiples reprises que la proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait longue et a clairement exprim\u00e9 son d\u00e9sir que le dossier se termine. Si la demande de Mme Nash avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que cela aurait eu, sans l\u2019ombre d\u2019un doute, un effet sur l\u2019audience et la gestion de la preuve et que cela aurait prolong\u00e9 la proc\u00e9dure.\n[90] Encore une fois, le Tribunal est sensible \u00e0 ce que Mme Nash a v\u00e9cu et comprend ses craintes et ses inqui\u00e9tudes. Cependant, il faut constater qu\u2019en d\u00e9posant sa requ\u00eate \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute, Mme Nash a pris les autres parties et le Tribunal par surprise, ce qui n\u2019a permis \u00e0 personne d\u2019anticiper une telle demande et de se pr\u00e9parer en cons\u00e9quence. Ceci est aussi contraire aux R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal ainsi qu\u2019aux principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[91] Ainsi, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice d\u2019accorder cette demande et de devoir suspendre la proc\u00e9dure ou la repousser afin de donner le temps \u00e0 Mme Nash d\u2019entreprendre ses d\u00e9marches. C\u2019est tout le syst\u00e8me qui aurait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9, ce qui n\u2019est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de personne.\n[92] Enfin, Mme Nash a expliqu\u00e9 que le retard de sa demande de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin \u00e9tait sa r\u00e9ponse au d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif des noms des t\u00e9moins des Forces qui allaient t\u00e9moigner sur leurs politiques. Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu par cet argument.\n[93] Les Forces ont depuis longtemps inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les parties qu\u2019elles allaient appeler deux t\u00e9moins afin de parler de leurs politiques et cela n\u2019a pas pos\u00e9 de probl\u00e8me en soi dans la proc\u00e9dure. Selon l\u2019affidavit de Mme Nash, il semble que la raison majeure pour laquelle elle a tard\u00e9 \u00e0 demander la citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00e9tait plut\u00f4t li\u00e9e \u00e0 des craintes et des inqui\u00e9tudes relatives \u00e0 sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\n[94] Il faut ajouter que la plaignante a aussi le fardeau de d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence de discrimination \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue. Mme Nash a le r\u00f4le premier de pr\u00e9senter au Tribunal toute la preuve n\u00e9cessaire afin d\u2019appuyer ses pr\u00e9tentions et ses all\u00e9gations. Mme Nash devait alors d\u00e9terminer, \u00e0 l\u2019avance, les t\u00e9moins dont elle avait besoin, ce qui comprend tout t\u00e9moin qui aurait pu t\u00e9moigner sur ses all\u00e9gations relatives aux politiques des Forces, et les convoquer en temps opportun, et ce, ind\u00e9pendamment des t\u00e9moins annonc\u00e9s par les Forces.\n[95] De plus, g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un t\u00e9moin myst\u00e8re ni totalement inconnu puisque Mme Nash connaissait d\u00e9j\u00e0 son implication depuis qu\u2019il a rendu sa d\u00e9cision en f\u00e9vrier 2019. \u00c0 cet effet, elle a avou\u00e9 avoir \u00e9valu\u00e9 l\u2019option de l\u2019appeler comme t\u00e9moin il y a de cela plus d\u2019une ann\u00e9e. Ce faisant, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu par l\u2019argument de Mme Nash selon lequel sa citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre \u00e9tait une r\u00e9ponse au d\u00e9p\u00f4t tardif des noms des t\u00e9moins des Forces. Il est malheureux que cette demande n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en temps utile.\n[96] En conclusion et pour ces motifs, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 la demande de Mme Nash. Cela dit, d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments militaient \u00e9galement en faveur du rejet de sa demande, et c\u2019est ce qui sera abord\u00e9 dans la prochaine section de cette d\u00e9cision, notamment au regard de la pertinence et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance.\nC. N\u00e9cessit\u00e9, pertinence et secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 [97] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que le Tribunal a l\u2019autorit\u00e9 afin de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre les t\u00e9moins dont il juge le t\u00e9moignage n\u00e9cessaire afin de disposer de la plainte. Dans la version fran\u00e7aise, l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la LCDP se lit comme suit :\n(3) Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\na) d\u2019assigner et de contraindre les t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 d\u00e9poser verbalement ou par \u00e9crit sous la foi du serment et \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte, au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019une cour sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019archives;\n[98] Dans la version anglaise, il se lit comme suit :\n(3) In relation to a hearing of the inquiry, the member or panel may\n(a) in the same manner and to the same extent as a superior court of record, summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel them to give oral or written evidence on oath and to produce any documents and things that the member or panel considers necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint;\n[99] Bien que les formulations ne soient pas exactement les m\u00eames dans les deux versions \u2013 t\u00e9moignages jug\u00e9s \u00ab indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte \u00bb dans la version fran\u00e7aise et \u00ab necessary for the full hearing and consideration of the complaint \u00bb dans la version anglaise \u2013 le m\u00eame sens s\u2019en \u00e9chappe : il faut que le t\u00e9moignage soit n\u00e9cessaire et pertinent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte.\n[100] Autrement dit, il doit exister un lien entre le t\u00e9moignage et la preuve qu\u2019une partie tente d\u2019obtenir relativement \u00e0 un fait, une question de droit ou une r\u00e9paration (Dorais c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2021 TCDP 13 (CanLII), au par. 21; Schecter c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2005 TCDP 35 (CanLII), au par. 21).\n[101] Dans un premier temps, le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que Mme Nash avait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin dans la proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas fourni de justifications suffisantes permettant au Tribunal d\u2019outrepasser ses R\u00e8gles de pratiques et les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale.\n[102] Ce d\u00e9lai tardif doit aussi \u00eatre analys\u00e9 au regard de la valeur probante du t\u00e9moignage potentiel de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, s\u2019il \u00e9tait appel\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin. Force est de constater, comme le Tribunal l\u2019expliquera dans les prochains paragraphes, que le t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance serait fondamentalement limit\u00e9 vu la nature de son implication dans le dossier de Mme Nash, ce qui affecterait par le fait m\u00eame la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 et la pertinence de son t\u00e9moignage.\n[103] Il appara\u00eet clair pour le Tribunal que Mme Nash tente de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance non pas en tant que simple t\u00e9moin ordinaire, qui pourrait venir t\u00e9moigner sur des faits pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019audience dont il a eu connaissance. Mme Nash tente plut\u00f4t de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme t\u00e9moin afin qu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne sur la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il a rendue le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019 et qui concerne son grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 contre les Forces en 2014.\n[104] Autrement dit, Mme Nash tente de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance dans sa fonction de d\u00e9cideur administratif, dans sa fonction d\u2019autorit\u00e9 finale d\u00e9cisionnelle ayant pris la d\u00e9cision de rejeter son grief le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019. \u00c0 cette fin, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas l\u2019autorit\u00e9 afin de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre cet individu qui jouit, en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif, de la protection du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[105] Le Tribunal note que dans sa demande de citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre du 27 janvier 2023, Mme Nash a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment r\u00e9sum\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n[traduction] Retrait\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Jonathan Vance est l\u2019auteur de la R\u00e9ponse Finale du Grief sur les Politiques, qui peut parler sp\u00e9cifiquement de son propre rapport.\n[106] Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage est non \u00e9quivoque : Mme Nash veut que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance soit cit\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin afin de parler de son [traduction] \u00ab rapport \u00bb du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019.\n[107] Cela dit, lorsque le Tribunal a consult\u00e9 le \u00ab rapport \u00bb de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, tel que Mme Nash l\u2019a d\u00e9crit, plusieurs interrogations lui sont apparues. Dans ce \u00ab rapport \u00bb, il est clairement \u00e9crit que la [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb \u2013 de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u2013 est finale, sans appel au sein des Forces, et est contraignante, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur la d\u00e9fense nationale, L.R.C. (1985) ch. N-5 (\u00ab LDN \u00bb). Il est \u00e9galement \u00e9crit que sa \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb n\u2019est pas appelable ou r\u00e9visable par aucune autre cour, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la r\u00e9vision judiciaire au titre de la Loi sur les Cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales, L.R.C. (1985) ch. F-7 (\u00ab LCF \u00bb).\n[108] Il y est \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire peut \u00eatre demand\u00e9e dans les 30 jours de sa \u00ab d\u00e9cision \u00bb devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 18.1(2) de la LCF (voir C-109 \u2013 D\u00e9cision de J.H. Vance, General, dat\u00e9e du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019, aux pages 15 et 16).\n[109] Maintenant, le Tribunal constate que Mme Nash a tent\u00e9 de d\u00e9vier le probl\u00e8me en d\u00e9crivant le document produit par g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme \u00e9tant un \u00ab rapport \u00bb. Il est \u00e9vident aux yeux du Tribunal que le document produit par g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance n\u2019est pas un \u00ab rapport \u00bb, mais bien une d\u00e9cision. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance a agi en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif et a tranch\u00e9 un grief pour lequel il a produit une d\u00e9cision. L\u2019avocate de la plaignante a eu du mal \u00e0 accepter cette \u00e9vidence, et ce, malgr\u00e9 les questions et interventions du Tribunal \u00e0 cet effet, en vue de lui faire comprendre la nature r\u00e9elle du document produit par g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance.\n[110] Ainsi, et si le Tribunal reprend le sommaire de t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance comme produit par Mme Nash, la raison pour laquelle elle demande au Tribunal de citer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance \u00e0 compara\u00eetre vise \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne de sa d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 son grief. Autrement dit, Mme Nash veut lui poser des questions en lien avec sa d\u00e9cision rendue le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019 qui a rejet\u00e9 son grief.\n[111] Les arguments pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal confirment \u00e9galement, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la seule raison pour laquelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance est intervenu dans le dossier de Mme Nash est en lien avec le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son grief. Mme Nash n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucun autre argument permettant au Tribunal d\u2019en venir \u00e0 une autre conclusion ou de d\u00e9montrer que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, outre le grief, a eu un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer dans les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 sa plainte. Ainsi, si cela n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 du grief d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par Mme Nash en 2014, rien ne d\u00e9montre que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, le chef d\u2019\u00c9tat-Major de la D\u00e9fense au sein des Forces, aurait eu une quelconque implication dans son dossier.\n[112] G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, lorsqu\u2019il a rendu sa d\u00e9cision rejetant le grief de Mme Nash, agissait en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif. Dans Commission scolaire de Laval c. Syndicat de l\u2019enseignement de la r\u00e9gion de Laval, 2016 SCC 8 (CanLII) [Laval], la Cour supr\u00eame r\u00e9it\u00e8re qu\u2019il est impossible de demander \u00e0 un juge d\u2019expliquer ou de rendre des comptes relativement \u00e0 son jugement ou sa d\u00e9cision. Exiger qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur, qu\u2019un juge, soit citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre comme t\u00e9moin afin d\u2019expliquer les raisons pour lesquelles il a rendu un jugement est une attaque directe \u00e0 l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance judiciaire (Laval, au par. 57).\n[113] Toujours dans Laval, la Cour supr\u00eame rappelle que le secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 prot\u00e8ge aussi les tribunaux administratifs ou les d\u00e9cideurs administratifs, mais que la protection n\u2019est pas aussi \u00e9tanche que celle accord\u00e9e au juge judiciaire (Laval, au par. 58). \u00c0 ce sujet, dans Tremblay c. Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des affaires sociales), 1992 CanLII 1135 (CSC) [Tremblay], cette cour \u00e9non\u00e7ait, \u00e0 la page 966, ce qui suit :\nIl me semble donc que, de par la nature du contr\u00f4le qui est exerc\u00e9 sur leurs d\u00e9cisions, les tribunaux administratifs ne puissent invoquer le secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 au m\u00eame degr\u00e9 que les tribunaux judiciaires. Le secret demeure bien s\u00fbr la r\u00e8gle, mais il pourra n\u00e9anmoins \u00eatre lev\u00e9 lorsque le justiciable peut faire \u00e9tat de raisons s\u00e9rieuses de croire que le processus suivi n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle.\n[114] Ce faisant, il existe donc une exception au principe du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 dans le cas d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif. Sans surprise, la plaignante a effectivement plaid\u00e9 que le Tribunal devrait appliquer l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue et lever le voile du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 puisque le processus d\u00e9cisionnel de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9, \u00e0 son avis, les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention de s\u2019attarder longuement \u00e0 cet argument.\n[115] Le Tribunal rappelle que la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance n\u2019est r\u00e9visable que par une cour de supervision, dans ce cas-ci, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 29.15 de la LDN. Il n\u2019est pas le r\u00f4le du Tribunal de superviser le processus d\u00e9cisionnel ni la d\u00e9cision elle-m\u00eame de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance en tant qu\u2019autorit\u00e9 finale dans le processus de grief. Le Tribunal n\u2019est aucunement dans une position de supervision quant \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision ou ce processus d\u00e9cisionnel. G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance a accompli le mandat qui lui \u00e9tait conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par sa loi habilitante, a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 du grief de Mme Nash en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif et a rejet\u00e9 sa demande.\n[116] Ainsi, c\u2019est \u00e0 une cour de supervision de d\u00e9terminer si le processus d\u00e9cisionnel d\u2019un tribunal administratif ou d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas ce pouvoir en tant que tribunal administratif au regard d\u2019une d\u00e9cision d\u2019un autre d\u00e9cideur administratif.\n[117] Dans la m\u00eame veine, toute la jurisprudence d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les Forces au sujet du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 concerne des cours de supervision qui se retrouvaient dans un r\u00f4le de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance des d\u00e9cisions de d\u00e9cideurs de tribunaux ou d\u2019organes inf\u00e9rieurs (voir par exemple Timm c. Canada, 2019 CF 36 (CanLII); Laval et Tremblay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es; Ellis-Don Ltd. c. Ontario (Commission des relations de travail), 2001 CSC 4 (CanLII), [2001] 1 RCS 221).\n[118] Dans ces d\u00e9cisions, il s\u2019agissait par exemple de la Cour supr\u00eame ou de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui se positionnaient, en tant que cour de supervision, sur la question du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019une commission ou d\u2019un commissaire, donc, d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif tout comme le Tribunal.\n[119] Maintenant, que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou que la Cour supr\u00eame, dans leur fonction de surveillance, d\u00e9cide de lever le voile du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur administratif en raison de craintes s\u00e9rieuses que le processus d\u00e9cisionnel suivi n\u2019ait pas respect\u00e9 les r\u00e8gles de justice naturelle et l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, le Tribunal peut bien le concevoir. Toutefois, ni la plaignante ni la Commission n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019argument ou de jurisprudence qui d\u00e9montreraient que le Tribunal, en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif, a le pouvoir de lever le secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019un autre d\u00e9cideur administratif, alors qu\u2019aucune relation de supervision ou de surveillance n\u2019existe entre les deux.\n[120] En cons\u00e9quence, une intervention du Tribunal visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance et son processus d\u00e9cisionnel respectent les principes de justice naturelle reviendrait n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 le positionner en tant que cour ou tribunal de supervision. Il s\u2019agit ni plus ni moins d\u2019une contestation indirecte de la d\u00e9cision finale de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance devant notre Tribunal alors que le recours en contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00e9tait la bonne voie \u00e0 suivre si la plaignante avait des motifs de contester la d\u00e9cision.\n[121] Cela \u00e9tant dit, toutes les questions relatives au processus d\u00e9cisionnel suivi par g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, dont les raisons pour lesquelles la d\u00e9cision est rest\u00e9e pr\u00e8s de deux ann\u00e9es sur sa pile de dossiers, les raisons pour lesquelles il a pris autant de temps afin de rendre sa d\u00e9cision, en quoi le syst\u00e8me aurait-il pu traiter Mme Nash avec plus de compassion et de flexibilit\u00e9 comme ce qui est \u00e9crit dans sa d\u00e9cision, etc., donc tout ce qui touche la d\u00e9cision de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance, de pr\u00e8s ou de loin, est fondamentalement prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de lever ce voile et ne peut convoquer g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance afin qu\u2019il fournisse des d\u00e9tails sur son processus d\u00e9cisionnel et sa d\u00e9cision.\n[122] Ce faisant, puisque g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance jouit de la protection du secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, que reste-t-il de son t\u00e9moignage s\u2019il ne peut commenter, de pr\u00e8s ou de loin, sa d\u00e9cision du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019 concernant le grief de Mme Nash? De toute \u00e9vidence, il faut conclure qu\u2019il ne reste pas grand-chose.\n[123] Mme Nash a plaid\u00e9 que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance pourrait t\u00e9moigner, de fa\u00e7on plus large, des politiques au sein des Forces et qui sont en jeu dans sa plainte devant le Tribunal. Encore une fois et selon ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal, la seule raison pour laquelle g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance est intervenu dans le dossier de Mme Nash est en lien avec son grief. Que g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance vienne parler de politiques g\u00e9n\u00e9rales au sein des Forces, sans pouvoir les lier \u00e0 la situation personnelle de Mme Nash rend son t\u00e9moignage moins pertinent. S\u2019il devait lier la mise en \u0153uvre d\u2019une politique ou l\u2019application d\u2019une politique \u00e0 la situation de la plaignante, il en reviendrait finalement \u00e0 faire exactement ce qu\u2019il a fait dans sa d\u00e9cision du 27 f\u00e9vrier 2019 puisque dans sa d\u00e9cision, il met en relief les all\u00e9gations de Mme Nash et l\u2019application de plusieurs politiques des Forces, politiques qui sont \u00e9galement en jeu dans sa plainte devant le Tribunal.\n[124] Ainsi, Mme Nash n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments probants permettant au Tribunal de conclure que le reste du t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance est suffisamment pertinent et n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019examen de la plainte. De plus, la valeur probante du reste du t\u00e9moignage de g\u00e9n\u00e9ral Vance sur les politiques des Forces, de mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, sans pouvoir les lier \u00e0 sa d\u00e9cision quant au grief de Mme Nash, ne l\u2019emporte pas sur les risques d\u2019atteinte au secret du d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9. Ce faisant, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire de citer \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ce t\u00e9moin au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la LCDP.\nV.

APER\u00c7U\n[1] Jamus Dorey, Karolin Alkerton, David Huntley et Roderick McGregor (les \u00ab plaignants \u00bb) ont ouvert des r\u00e9gimes enregistr\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (les \u00ab REEI \u00bb) dans des institutions financi\u00e8res entre 2015 et 2019. Ces personnes ne sont plus admissibles aux subventions et bons en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9, L.C. 2007, ch. 35, art. 136 (la \u00ab LCEI \u00bb) et du R\u00e8glement canadien sur l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9, DORS\/2008-186 (le \u00ab RCEI \u00bb ou \u00ab le R\u00e8glement \u00bb) parce qu\u2019elles sont toutes \u00e2g\u00e9es de plus de 49 ans. Les plaignants affirment que leurs plaintes comportent deux volets. Premi\u00e8rement, ils all\u00e8guent que les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 et les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9tablis dans la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation qui r\u00e9gissent les r\u00e9gimes d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 constituent une pratique discriminatoire dans la prestation d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). Deuxi\u00e8mement, ils all\u00e8guent qu\u2019Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (\u00ab EDSC \u00bb) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard pour cause de d\u00e9ficience dans la fa\u00e7on d\u2019administrer et de promouvoir le REEI (les \u00ab all\u00e9gations administratives \u00bb). Ils disent que leurs plaintes ont toujours comport\u00e9 ces deux volets.\n[2] Le d\u00e9fendeur, EDSC, est le minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada responsable de l\u2019\u00e9laboration, de la gestion et de la prestation des programmes et services sociaux. EDSC nie \u00eatre un fournisseur de services au sens de la Loi dans les plaintes en cause parce qu\u2019une contestation des crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans les textes l\u00e9gislatifs doit \u00eatre soumise aux cours de justice en vertu de la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, ch. 11. EDSC nie \u00e9galement \u00eatre un fournisseur de services aux personnes handicap\u00e9es qui souhaitent ouvrir un REEI parce que ces services sont fournis par des institutions financi\u00e8res enregistr\u00e9es.\n[3] EDSC a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate, demandant au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) de rejeter les plaintes. Premi\u00e8rement, EDSC affirme que les plaintes que la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal correspondent \u00e0 des contestations inadmissibles de lois et d\u2019instruments r\u00e9glementaires qui d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e de la Loi, et qu\u2019il est manifeste et \u00e9vident qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. Deuxi\u00e8mement, EDSC demande au Tribunal de radier les all\u00e9gations administratives parce qu\u2019elles sont nouvelles et qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9es apr\u00e8s que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal. EDSC affirme que le fait de permettre l\u2019instruction des all\u00e9gations administratives nuirait au processus et constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure qui contournerait le syst\u00e8me de renvoi en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne pr\u00e9vu dans la Loi.\n[4] La Commission a d\u2019abord adopt\u00e9 la th\u00e8se selon laquelle le R\u00e8glement pourrait \u00eatre contest\u00e9 devant le Tribunal. La Commission est revenue sur sa position apr\u00e8s avoir renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes au Tribunal et convient maintenant avec EDSC que les contestations du R\u00e8glement non discr\u00e9tionnaire en cause dans ces plaintes ne rel\u00e8vent pas de la port\u00e9e de la Loi. Toutefois, la Commission affirme que les all\u00e9gations administratives s\u2019inscrivent dans la port\u00e9e des plaintes initiales qu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal et qu\u2019il convient d\u2019y donner suite.\n[5] Les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse conjointe \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC. Ils sont en grande partie d\u2019accord avec les observations de la Commission, bien qu\u2019ils aient ajout\u00e9 certains aspects individuels \u00e0 leurs observations. Certains des plaignants ne sont pas d\u2019accord avec la proposition voulant qu\u2019une contestation du R\u00e8glement d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e de la Loi. Ils demandent au Tribunal de rejeter la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC en radiation parce qu\u2019ils estiment qu\u2019il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de leurs all\u00e9gations.\n[6] La pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate m\u2019oblige d\u2019abord \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer la nature et la port\u00e9e des plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal. Apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de la nature r\u00e9elle de ces plaintes et de la fa\u00e7on de les qualifier, je serai en mesure de d\u00e9cider si le Tribunal peut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 leur instruction, en tout ou en partie.\n[7] Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, la Commission a ajout\u00e9 sa propre demande, sans pr\u00e9avis. Elle veut que je rejette la requ\u00eate et que je d\u00e9cide si le Tribunal peut entendre les contestations du R\u00e8glement formul\u00e9es par les plaignants et se prononcer sur leur bien-fond\u00e9 en tant que question pr\u00e9liminaire. Je rejette la demande de la Commission. J\u2019aborderai cette nouvelle question ci-apr\u00e8s avant de me prononcer sur le fond de la requ\u00eate.\nII. D\u00c9CISION\n[8] J\u2019accueille la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC et rejette les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9. Les plaintes remettent en question les limites fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge prescrites par le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif auquel sont assujettis les r\u00e9gimes d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9. Les all\u00e9gations visent la substance m\u00eame de la LCEI et de son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application. Les droits non discr\u00e9tionnaires conf\u00e9r\u00e9s ne correspondent pas \u00e0 un service offert au public par EDSC. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019accorder des prestations ni des indemnit\u00e9s. Il est \u00e9vident que ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019aboutir.\n[9] Les all\u00e9gations administratives n\u2019ont pas un lien suffisant avec les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal. Permettre \u00e0 ces plaintes d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant contournerait le processus de r\u00e9ception et d\u2019examen des plaintes pr\u00e9vu par la Loi et causerait un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 EDSC.\nIII. CONTEXTE L\u00c9GISLATIF DES R\u00c9GIMES D\u2019\u00c9PARGNE-INVALIDIT\u00c9\n[10] Avant de me pencher sur les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai abord\u00e9 certains des cadres l\u00e9gislatifs et r\u00e9glementaires qui r\u00e9gissent les r\u00e9gimes enregistr\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9, car ils sont pertinents \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont j\u2019ai qualifi\u00e9 les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes.\n[11] La Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1, art. 146.4 (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb), la LCEI et le RCEI sont les instruments juridiques qui r\u00e9gissent le fonctionnement des r\u00e9gimes enregistr\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 au Canada. Certains crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LIR, mais un grand nombre sont \u00e9galement inclus dans la LCEI et dans le RCEI.\n[12] Les REEI sont des r\u00e9gimes enregistr\u00e9s d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 qui visent \u00e0 soutenir l\u2019\u00e9pargne \u00e0 long terme et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re des Canadiens handicap\u00e9s et de leur famille. Ils sont \u00e9tablis en vertu d\u2019une disposition de la LIR (art. 146.4) et ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis \u00e0 la disposition des Canadiens handicap\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois en 2008. Ces r\u00e9gimes permettent aux fonds de cro\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019imp\u00f4t dans des comptes qui doivent \u00eatre enregistr\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada et ouverts par l\u2019entremise des institutions financi\u00e8res participantes. Les cotisations peuvent \u00eatre vers\u00e9es jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 une personne atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 59 ans, et les retraits doivent commencer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans (art. 146.4 de la LIR). Ces exigences et d\u2019autres crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 146.4 de la LIR, mais figurent \u00e9galement dans la LCEI et le RCEI.\n[13] Le gouvernement du Canada offre des subventions et des bons de contrepartie aux Canadiens handicap\u00e9s \u00e0 faible revenu qui sont vers\u00e9s directement dans un REEI. Les subventions canadiennes pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (les \u00ab subventions \u00bb) et les bons canadiens pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (les \u00ab bons \u00bb) sont \u00e9tablis en vertu de la LCEI. Le gouvernement du Canada versera une subvention de contrepartie de 100 %, 200 % ou 300 % des cotisations d\u2019un particulier admissible, selon le revenu familial net rajust\u00e9 du b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire et le montant cotis\u00e9. Ces r\u00e8gles sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la LCEI et le RCEI (art. 2). Les bons sont des montants suppl\u00e9mentaires vers\u00e9s directement au REEI par le gouvernement du Canada pour les Canadiens handicap\u00e9s \u00e0 faible revenu. Aucune contribution n\u2019est n\u00e9cessaire pour recevoir le bon. Le montant peut atteindre 1 000 $ par ann\u00e9e et le maximum cumulatif \u00e0 vie s\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 20 000 $. Les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux bons sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCEI et le RCEI (art. 3).\n[14] La LCEI permet \u00e9galement \u00e0 une personne de reporter des droits inutilis\u00e9s de subventions et de bons des dix ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, aussi appel\u00e9s \u00ab application de la cotisation \u00bb. Ces applications peuvent \u00eatre pay\u00e9es sur les demandes de cotisations et de bons faites par un b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire jusqu\u2019au 31 d\u00e9cembre de l\u2019ann\u00e9e de son 49e anniversaire. Il existe des limites annuelles pour les subventions et les bons report\u00e9s et un maximum cumulatif \u00e0 vie pour les subventions. Ces dispositions ainsi que les plafonds sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCEI.\nIV. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE\n1. Devrais-je d\u00e9terminer si les contestations du R\u00e8glement rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5, \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire lors d\u2019une audience, plut\u00f4t que de trancher la question dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en radiation?\n2. Les plaintes rel\u00e8vent-elles du champ d\u2019application de la Loi?\ni) Les plaintes remettent-elles en question la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation? Dans l\u2019affirmative, font-elles \u00e9galement \u00e9tat de discrimination quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont un service a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni aux plaignants?\nii) Si les plaintes portent uniquement sur la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation, est\u2011il manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019aboutir?\n3. Les all\u00e9gations administratives peuvent-elles aller de l\u2019avant?\ni) Les all\u00e9gations administratives ont-elles un lien suffisant avec les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal?\nV. MOTIFS\n1. Devrais-je d\u00e9terminer si les contestations du R\u00e8glement rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019article 5, \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire lors d\u2019une audience, plut\u00f4t que de trancher la question dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en radiation?\n[15] La r\u00e9ponse est non. Je rejette la demande de la Commission de soulever les m\u00eames questions \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire lors d\u2019une audience. La demande constitue un gaspillage des ressources de toutes les parties, y compris celles du Tribunal. Le fait de trancher cette question par voie de requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par \u00e9crit est juste et efficace, et favorise l\u2019obligation l\u00e9gale du Tribunal d\u2019instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (par. 48.9(1) de la Loi).\n[16] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e9tendue des plaintes par voie de requ\u00eate en radiation (Richards c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2020 TCDP 27, au paragraphe 85 [Richards]; Cushley et al. c. Anciens Combattants Canada, 2022 TCDP 21, aux paragraphes 16 \u00e0 18).\n[17] Dans le cas d\u2019une requ\u00eate en radiation, le Tribunal suppose que les faits sont v\u00e9ridiques et la preuve n\u2019est pas admissible. Le Tribunal doit faire preuve de prudence lorsqu\u2019il radie une demande avant la tenue d\u2019une audience, et il ne doit le faire que dans les \u00ab cas les plus clairs \u00bb (Richards, au paragraphe 86). L\u2019approche doit \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9reuse et permettre, dans la mesure du possible, l\u2019instruction de toute demande in\u00e9dite, mais soutenable (R. c. Imperial Tobacco Canada Lt\u00e9e, 2011 CSC 42, au paragraphe 21). M\u00eame une demande juridique complexe et in\u00e9dite peut \u00e0 juste titre \u00eatre radi\u00e9e d\u2019un acte de proc\u00e9dure si, apr\u00e8s une analyse appropri\u00e9e du droit, il est manifeste et \u00e9vident que la demande ne peut \u00eatre accueillie (Callan v. Cooke, 2012 BCSC 1589, au paragraphe 19).\n[18] Les parties ne contestent pas que j\u2019ai le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en radiation. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, la Commission demande que j\u2019entende plut\u00f4t la premi\u00e8re question soulev\u00e9e par EDSC comme une \u00ab question pr\u00e9liminaire \u00bb sur le fond. La Commission rappelle \u00e9galement au Tribunal qu\u2019il peut [traduction] \u00ab faire preuve de souplesse pour garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00bb et que je peux choisir de tenir une audience.\n[19] Or, la Commission n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 en quoi le fait de trancher \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire ce qu\u2019elle qualifie de [traduction] \u00ab question purement juridique \u00bb pourrait influer sur l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire. Bien que la radiation des all\u00e9gations avant la tenue d\u2019une audience en bonne et due forme exige l\u2019application du crit\u00e8re plus rigoureux quant au caract\u00e8re \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb, il incombe \u00e0 EDSC de me convaincre que ce crit\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Si je conclus que les all\u00e9gations contestant le R\u00e8glement ne satisfont pas \u00e0 ce crit\u00e8re plus rigoureux, je rejetterai la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC sur ce point, et nous proc\u00e9derons de toute fa\u00e7on \u00e0 une audience compl\u00e8te.\n[20] Si la Commission ne croyait pas qu\u2019il \u00e9tait manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations contestant le R\u00e8glement ne pouvaient pas aboutir, elle aurait pu pr\u00e9senter des observations pour r\u00e9futer l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019EDSC selon laquelle ces all\u00e9gations n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. La Commission partage plut\u00f4t l\u2019avis d\u2019EDSC selon lequel les plaignants doivent porter leur contestation devant les cours de justice et que leurs all\u00e9gations ne rel\u00e8vent pas du champ d\u2019application de la Loi. Elle souhaite n\u00e9anmoins que le Tribunal rejette la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC, vraisemblablement pour que les parties puissent pr\u00e9senter de nouveau les m\u00eames arguments juridiques ou les reprendre de vive voix lors d\u2019une audience que personne n\u2019a demand\u00e9e, m\u00eame si le seuil relatif au rejet des all\u00e9gations est moins rigoureux. Elle soutient qu\u2019il serait plus efficace de le faire, rappelant l\u2019obligation du Tribunal de proc\u00e9der de fa\u00e7on informelle, rapide et \u00e9quitable.\n[21] Mais la tenue d\u2019une audience ou la disjonction des points en litige pour d\u00e9terminer une m\u00eame question \u00e0 laquelle je peux r\u00e9pondre maintenant \u2013 avec des centaines de pages d\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, de documents de requ\u00eate et d\u2019arguments juridiques que la Commission reconna\u00eet que j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 devant moi \u2013 vont \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019exigence relative au caract\u00e8re exp\u00e9ditif et informel \u00e9nonc\u00e9e au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi. De plus, la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de soulever cette question maintenant \u2013 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u2013 mine nos efforts collectifs en mati\u00e8re de gestion de cas, qui visaient \u00e0 trouver des fa\u00e7ons efficaces et \u00e9quitables de proc\u00e9der.\n[22] J\u2019ai bri\u00e8vement d\u00e9crit le contexte proc\u00e9dural et l\u2019historique de la gestion de cas de ces plaintes parce qu\u2019il est pertinent pour ma d\u00e9cision de rejeter la demande de la Commission et de proc\u00e9der comme convenu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment avec les parties.\n[23] La Commission a initialement tenu en suspens les plaintes de Mme Alkerton, de M. Huntley et de M. McGregor en attendant la d\u00e9cision de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada (\u00ab la Cour \u00bb) dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CSC 31 [Andrews\/Matson]. Dans l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson, la Cour a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les effets pr\u00e9judiciables all\u00e9gu\u00e9s d\u00e9coulant exclusivement de la l\u00e9gislation ne concernaient pas un service habituellement offert au public.\n[24] La Commission a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de renvoyer les plaintes au Tribunal parce que l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson ne portait pas sur des contestations d\u2019un r\u00e8glement. Elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 regroup\u00e9es dans une seule enqu\u00eate. Lorsque la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de M. Dorey au Tribunal, les parties ont consenti \u00e0 s\u2019y joindre parce qu\u2019elle comportait des questions de fait et de droit communes aux autres plaintes.\n[25] D\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de la gestion de cas, EDSC a soulev\u00e9 la question pr\u00e9liminaire de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal d\u2019instruire les plaintes qui remettent en question des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que sa position \u00e9tait dor\u00e9navant que l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson s\u2019applique au R\u00e8glement non discr\u00e9tionnaire en cause dans les pr\u00e9sentes plaintes. Une fois que les parties ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s, EDSC a ajout\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me question pr\u00e9liminaire. Cette question portait que les all\u00e9gations administratives d\u00e9passaient la port\u00e9e des plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal et qu\u2019elles ne devraient pas \u00eatre retenues.\n[26] J\u2019ai travaill\u00e9 avec les parties \u00e0 la gestion de cas pour d\u00e9terminer comment traiter de fa\u00e7on efficace et \u00e9quitable les deux questions soulev\u00e9es par EDSC. Apr\u00e8s avoir entendu les parties, j\u2019ai fix\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais pour la requ\u00eate en radiation d\u2019EDSC, ainsi que pour les r\u00e9ponses et les r\u00e9pliques.\n[27] Avant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la Commission ne s\u2019opposait pas \u00e0 ce qu\u2019une requ\u00eate en radiation soit d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par EDSC, et les plaignants non plus. Personne n\u2019a demand\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations de vive voix ou de plaider ces questions de droit lors d\u2019une audience sur le fond plut\u00f4t que de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites sur la question de savoir si les all\u00e9gations pouvaient \u00eatre radi\u00e9es. Lorsque le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 12 octobre 2022 qui comprenait des dates limites pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des documents de la requ\u00eate \u00e9crite, la Commission ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9e \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont j\u2019ai d\u00e9fini le processus ni n\u2019a soutenu que le Tribunal devrait s\u00e9parer les points en litige et trancher le bien-fond\u00e9 de la question ou entendre des observations de vive voix.\n[28] Les tribunaux administratifs sont ma\u00eetres chez eux. Ils peuvent faire preuve de souplesse, pour autant que les processus qu\u2019ils \u00e9tablissent soient \u00e9quitables. \u00ab [O]n ne vise pas \u00e0 cr\u00e9er la \u201cperfection proc\u00e9durale\u201d, mais bien \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un certain \u00e9quilibre entre le besoin d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9, d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et de pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 des r\u00e9sultats. \u00bb (Knight c. Indian Head School Division No. 19, 1990 CanLII 138 [CSC], [1990] 1 RCS 653, \u00e0 la page 685, citant de Smith\u2019s Judicial Review of Administrative Action, [4e \u00e9d. 1980], \u00e0 la page 240).\n[29] Le report de ma d\u00e9cision sur cette question ne sert \u00e0 personne. Je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 rejeter la requ\u00eate et \u00e0 exiger des parties qu\u2019elles consacrent plus de temps et de ressources \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9ter leurs arguments en tant que \u00ab question pr\u00e9liminaire \u00bb lors d\u2019une audience sur le fond. Je ne vois aucune raison de reporter cette question.\n[30] Les parties ont eu amplement l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9battre, dans leurs documents de requ\u00eate, de la question de savoir si les plaintes peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es et elles ont soulev\u00e9 bon nombre des m\u00eames points dans leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que la Commission le soul\u00e8ve dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, les plaignants n\u2019avaient pas exprim\u00e9 d\u2019inqui\u00e9tude quant \u00e0 la possibilit\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der par \u00e9crit par voie de requ\u00eate en radiation. Ils ont particip\u00e9 avec comp\u00e9tence et \u00e9loquence tout au long du processus de gestion de cas et ont coordonn\u00e9 des observations \u00e9crites sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. On ne sait pas tr\u00e8s bien en quoi le fait de retarder la r\u00e9solution de ces questions serait plus \u00e9quitable pour eux ou pour l\u2019une quelconque des parties, d\u2019autant plus que, selon les propres termes de la Commission, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une \u00ab question purement juridique \u00bb.\n[31] Je ne vois aucun compromis entre l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 dans le fait de trancher la question maintenant. Retarder une d\u00e9cision sur cette question est injuste non seulement pour les parties \u00e0 ces plaintes qui utiliseront plus de ressources et de temps \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 traiter la m\u00eame question en tant que \u00ab question pr\u00e9liminaire \u00bb, mais aussi pour les parties \u00e0 d\u2019autres affaires qui attendent que leur dossier progresse. Faire droit \u00e0 la demande de la Commission d\u00e9tournerait une partie des maigres ressources du Tribunal d\u2019autres affaires, et contribuerait \u00e9galement \u00e0 un retard institutionnel. Il n\u2019y a aucune raison de le faire alors que je suis en mesure d\u2019aborder pleinement et \u00e9quitablement la question pour les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance.\n[32] Les tribunaux administratifs ont aussi l\u2019obligation d\u2019utiliser efficacement leurs ressources. Le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi de d\u00e9l\u00e9guer la prise de d\u00e9cisions dans des domaines sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s comme les droits de la personne aux tribunaux administratifs et s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils rendent leurs d\u00e9cisions promptement et efficacement (Law Society of Saskatchewan c. Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29, aux paragraphes 46 et 64).\n[33] La Commission soutient \u00e9galement que je devrais trancher cette question en tant que question pr\u00e9liminaire \u2013 et peut-\u00eatre autoriser des observations de vive voix \u2013 parce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur cette question est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, qu\u2019elle donnera aux plaignants un certain degr\u00e9 de certitude, qu\u2019elle est importante pour eux et qu\u2019elle fournira des orientations dans le cas des plaintes futures qui soul\u00e8veront des questions similaires. Mais la Commission n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi ma d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate ne pouvait pas avoir le m\u00eame effet. Je d\u00e9cide des questions auxquelles les plaignants \u2013 et toutes les parties \u2013 m\u2019ont demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre, \u00e0 savoir si ces plaintes peuvent progresser dans notre processus, en tout ou en partie. La pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate met un terme \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, m\u00eame si l\u2019issue n\u2019est pas celle que les plaignants esp\u00e9raient.\n[34] S\u2019il n\u2019y a pas eu de d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur la question pr\u00e9cise de la contestation des r\u00e8glements depuis l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson, alors la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sera la premi\u00e8re. Mais ce serait aussi le cas si je devais trancher la m\u00eame question comme question pr\u00e9liminaire lors d\u2019une audience comme le sugg\u00e8re la Commission. Si la Commission pensait que quelque chose changerait lors d\u2019une audience par suite de l\u2019application d\u2019un crit\u00e8re moins rigoureux que celui du caract\u00e8re \u00ab manifeste et \u00e9vident \u00bb pour rejeter une plainte avant une audience, elle n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 de quoi il s\u2019agirait. Plut\u00f4t que de me dire pourquoi ces plaintes ont effectivement des chances raisonnables d\u2019aboutir et devraient \u00eatre instruites, la Commission a convenu avec EDSC que les contestations du R\u00e8glement d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e de la Loi et que les principes \u00e9labor\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson s\u2019appliquent \u00e0 ces plaintes.\n[35] Enfin, la Commission soutient que la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC constitue une attaque collat\u00e9rale inadmissible contre sa d\u00e9cision de renvoyer les plaintes au Tribunal et qu\u2019EDSC aurait d\u00fb en demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire.\n[36] EDSC affirme qu\u2019il ne demande pas \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019annuler ses d\u00e9cisions de renvoi. Il demande plut\u00f4t au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer le bien-fond\u00e9 des plaintes en se fondant sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire parce qu\u2019il estime que les plaintes n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019aboutir. Il dit que c\u2019est carr\u00e9ment le travail du Tribunal. La Commission joue un r\u00f4le d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable. Sa d\u00e9cision en mati\u00e8re de renvoi est de l\u2019histoire ancienne.\n[37] Je suis d\u2019accord. Peu importe ce que la Commission a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 dans le cadre de son processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate et de renvoi, il incombe au Tribunal de statuer sur le bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte, y compris de d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es ont des chances raisonnables d\u2019aboutir.\n[38] Le Tribunal a clairement le pouvoir de r\u00e9gler les questions soulev\u00e9es par EDSC dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate en radiation. Il peut aussi contr\u00f4ler son propre processus, pourvu qu\u2019il soit \u00e9quitable. Je d\u00e9termine les questions par voie de requ\u00eates \u00e9crites parce que c\u2019est la fa\u00e7on la plus efficace de traiter ces plaintes, comme nous en avons discut\u00e9 avec toutes les parties dans la gestion de cas. Je ne vois pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations de vive voix que personne n\u2019a demand\u00e9es, et la Commission ne m\u2019a pas convaincu que cela est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00ab garantir l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 \u00bb.\n2. Les plaintes rel\u00e8vent-elles du champ d\u2019application de la Loi?\n[39] Pour \u00e9tablir si les all\u00e9gations rel\u00e8vent de la port\u00e9e de la Loi, je dois d\u2019abord qualifier les plaintes et d\u00e9terminer les mesures ou les pratiques qu\u2019elles remettent en cause.\n[40] Tout ce que fait une personne qui travaille pour le gouvernement du Canada ou qui collabore avec ce dernier n\u2019est pas un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi, et je dois examiner l\u2019origine de l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 (voir Watkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2008 CAF 170 [Watkin], aux paragraphes 24 \u00e0 33, et Forward et Forward c. Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada, 2008 TCDP 5 [Forward], aux paragraphes 37 et 38).\n[41] Si l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui fournit des services habituellement offerts au grand public le fait d\u2019une mani\u00e8re fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite qui, dans les faits, en prive un individu ou d\u00e9favorise celui\u2011ci \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture, la plainte pourrait relever de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Mais si l\u2019intim\u00e9 applique des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatifs, la contestation ne porte pas sur la prestation de services, mais sur la loi elle-m\u00eame (Andrews\/Matson, au paragraphe 97, citant Murphy, au paragraphe 6).\n[42] J\u2019ai examin\u00e9 chacune des plaintes \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le parce que, bien qu\u2019elles pr\u00e9sentent des similitudes, je dois examiner les all\u00e9gations de chaque plaignant individuellement pour d\u00e9terminer si les mesures contest\u00e9es sont vraiment des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de la Loi. En d\u2019autres termes, quel est le comportement ou la pratique que les plaignants consid\u00e8rent comme discriminatoire? Est-ce la fa\u00e7on dont ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s par le personnel d\u2019EDSC? Sugg\u00e8rent-ils qu\u2019EDSC applique la loi de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire? Est-ce parce qu\u2019ils se sont vu refuser des prestations en raison des seuils d\u2019\u00e2ge pr\u00e9vus dans les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires applicables? Les plaignants contestent-ils vraiment la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation applicables?\ni) Les plaintes remettent-elles en question la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation? Dans l\u2019affirmative, font-elles \u00e9galement \u00e9tat de discrimination quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont un service a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni aux plaignants?\n[43] \u00c0 mon avis, les plaintes remettent en question le cadre l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e9glementaire applicable. Les quatre plaignants contestent les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge et les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LCEI, la LIR et les paragraphes 2 et 3 du RCEI. Ils affirment qu\u2019il est injuste que 49 ans soit l\u2019\u00e2ge limite pour recevoir les subventions et les bons en vertu de la LCEI et du R\u00e8glement. Certaines plaintes contestent \u00e9galement les dispositions de la LCEI relatives au report et \u00e0 la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9. De plus, les plaignants cherchent tous, comme r\u00e9paration, le paiement des prestations auxquelles ils n\u2019avaient pas droit sous le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif existant, et certains esp\u00e8rent que la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation pourraient \u00eatre modifi\u00e9es. Ils n\u2019all\u00e8guent aucune discrimination quant \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on dont un service leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni.\n[44] J\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci-apr\u00e8s les d\u00e9tails des quatre plaintes et des rapports aux fins de d\u00e9cision de la Commission. Malgr\u00e9 certaines diff\u00e9rences dans leurs plaintes, ma conclusion est la m\u00eame pour tous les plaignants. Que ces derniers aient ou non invoqu\u00e9 les motifs de l\u2019\u00e2ge et de la d\u00e9ficience, ou simplement l\u2019\u00e2ge, leurs plaintes reposent, pour l\u2019essentiel, sur le fait qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s diff\u00e9remment des autres personnes en raison du libell\u00e9 imp\u00e9ratif dans les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives et r\u00e9glementaires applicables.\nJames Dorey\n[45] M. Dorey a ouvert un REEI \u00e0 la Banque Toronto-Dominion en 2019. Une fois son REEI enregistr\u00e9, le Programme canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 son admissibilit\u00e9 aux bons et aux subventions pour 2019 et les 10 ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, soit depuis 2009. Il a re\u00e7u un total de 1 041,12 $ en bons pour les ann\u00e9es 2012 et 2013 parce que, au cours de ces ann\u00e9es, ses revenus \u00e9taient inf\u00e9rieurs aux seuils pr\u00e9vus par la LCEI et du RCEI \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. Il \u00e9tait admissible \u00e0 des subventions en 2019, 2020 et 2021, et a re\u00e7u un total de 31 500 $ en subventions de contrepartie en fonction de ses contributions annuelles aux termes du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. Comme M. Dorey a plus de 49 ans, il n\u2019est plus admissible aux subventions et aux bons. L\u2019argent de son REEI continuera de cro\u00eetre \u00e0 l\u2019abri de l\u2019imp\u00f4t, mais il devra commencer \u00e0 retirer ces fonds lorsqu\u2019il aura 60 ans.\n[46] M. Dorey a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission le 28 f\u00e9vrier 2020, alors qu\u2019il avait 48 ans, faisant \u00e9tat d\u2019all\u00e9gations de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Dans sa plainte, il souligne qu\u2019il cessera d\u2019\u00eatre admissible aux subventions et aux bons \u00e0 compter du 31 d\u00e9cembre 2021, l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il aura 49 ans. Il conteste le fait qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de cette date, il ne pourrait plus se pr\u00e9valoir de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 ni du report. En raison du plafond des montants de subvention qui peuvent \u00eatre vers\u00e9s au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e, il ne peut pas utiliser la totalit\u00e9 de son report prospectif pour b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des subventions de contrepartie avant de perdre son admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans.\n[47] Dans son rapport de d\u00e9cision, la Commission a d\u00e9crit la plainte de M. Dorey comme suit :\n[traduction]\n2. [\u2026] Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que certaines dispositions du R\u00e8glement canadien sur l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (RCEI) font \u00e9tat de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge.

Elle avait 53 ans \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e inadmissible aux subventions et aux bons parce qu\u2019elle avait plus de 49 ans. Elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte en janvier 2018, mais la Commission a mis celle-ci en suspens en attendant l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson. Dans sa plainte, Mme Alkerton explique que, lorsqu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de REEI, un agent d\u2019EDSC lui a dit qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 des subventions ou \u00e0 des bons parce qu\u2019elle avait plus de 49 ans.

La plaignante affirme que la limite d\u2019\u00e2ge est discriminatoire parce qu\u2019elle laisse entendre que les personnes handicap\u00e9es ont une esp\u00e9rance de vie limit\u00e9e. Elle all\u00e8gue que l\u2019application de l\u2019\u00e2ge limite de 49 ans est arbitraire et qu\u2019elle ne tient pas compte des circonstances particuli\u00e8res de la personne [\u2026] [L]orsque le mis en cause a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 le RCEI, elle avait 44 ans et aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 admissible aux prestations; toutefois, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant du programme avant 2017. Elle affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de m\u00e9canisme r\u00e9troactif dans le RCEI comme c\u2019est le cas pour le r\u00e9gime du CIPH.\nRoderick McGregor\n[50] M. McGregor est devenu invalide \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 48 ans et a ouvert un REEI en 2018, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 53 ans. Il affirme que lorsqu\u2019il avait 48 et 49 ans, il \u00e9tait totalement ou partiellement priv\u00e9 de capacit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale et qu\u2019il croit qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience. Il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas admissible \u00e0 des subventions et \u00e0 des bons parce qu\u2019il avait plus de 49 ans, et il dit que lorsqu\u2019il a ouvert un REEI dans son institution financi\u00e8re, on lui a dit qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas recevoir les subventions et les bons de contrepartie en invoquant les dispositions de report de 10 ans parce qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande apr\u00e8s son 49e anniversaire.\n[51] M. McGregor soutient qu\u2019il y a discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab lorsque la personne ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficie pas du m\u00eame intervalle raisonnable que les autres (qui \u00e9taient invalides bien avant l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans et qui avaient amplement le temps de r\u00e9agir et de pr\u00e9senter une demande) pour d\u00e9couvrir les prestations du REEI et les limites de d\u00e9lai parce que cet intervalle co\u00efncide avec la p\u00e9riode d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 associ\u00e9e \u00e0 cette m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience. \u00bb\n[52] Dans son rapport de d\u00e9cision, la Commission a d\u00e9crit la plainte de M.

Huntley a ouvert un REEI en 2015 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9 pour les 10 ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes. Il a re\u00e7u le plafond annuel maximal de subventions pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2014, ainsi qu\u2019un bon. M. Huntley a cess\u00e9 d\u2019\u00eatre admissible aux subventions et aux bons apr\u00e8s 2015, l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 il a eu 49 ans. Il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 2016, mais la Commission a mis celle-ci en suspens en attendant l\u2019issue dans l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson qui \u00e9tait devant les cours de justice. Il a d\u00e9crit le Programme canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant complexe et d\u00e9routant.\n[54] Dans son rapport de d\u00e9cision, la Commission a d\u00e9crit la plainte de M. Huntley comme suit :\n[traduction]\n2. Pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que certaines dispositions du R\u00e8glement canadien sur l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (RCEI) font \u00e9tat de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge. Il all\u00e8gue que le mis en cause a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en refusant de lui accorder les subventions de contrepartie offertes aux b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires du REEI, parce qu\u2019il limite l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 au r\u00e9gime aux personnes de moins de 49 ans. Il all\u00e8gue en outre que l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans est arbitraire.\n33. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le mis en cause se sert des restrictions fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge dans le RCEI pour lui refuser des services, ce qui constitue une pratique discriminatoire.\n49. La pr\u00e9sente plainte vise pour l\u2019essentiel \u00e0 contester les r\u00e8glements et non l\u2019application non discr\u00e9tionnaire des lois f\u00e9d\u00e9rales.\n55. Le plaignant affirme qu\u2019il est atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et que le mis en cause fait preuve \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de discrimination fond\u00e9e uniquement sur son ann\u00e9e de naissance. Il dit que le programme lui serait utile.\n56. Le plaignant affirme que la limite d\u2019\u00e2ge est discriminatoire parce que, s\u2019il \u00e9tait plus jeune, il recevrait un revenu plus \u00e9lev\u00e9.\n[55] Comme le soutient la Commission, pour d\u00e9cider si un r\u00e8glement, une disposition l\u00e9gislative ou une autre disposition correspond \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition d\u2019un service au sens de l\u2019article 5, il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation personnalis\u00e9e des all\u00e9gations formul\u00e9es dans une plainte et de l\u2019acte, de la mesure ou de l\u2019activit\u00e9 en question. Je ne suis pas li\u00e9e par la fa\u00e7on dont les plaignants et la Commission ont qualifi\u00e9 leurs plaintes.\n[56] Les plaignants font valoir que le Programme canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (le \u00ab Programme \u00bb) est un service administr\u00e9 par EDSC dans le cadre de son mandat d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter \u00ab des programmes et [de fournir] des services qui touchent les Canadiens tout au long de leur vie \u00bb.\n[57] Les plaignants ne pr\u00e9tendent toutefois pas qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas re\u00e7u les prestations auxquelles ils avaient droit en vertu de la LIR, de la LCEI ou du RCEI, ni qu\u2019EDSC a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de retenir les prestations, acte qui soit li\u00e9 d\u2019une fa\u00e7on ou d\u2019une autre \u00e0 un motif illicite. Ils n\u2019all\u00e8guent pas que quelqu\u2019un les a trait\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire ou leur a refus\u00e9 un service en raison d\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ou de l\u2019\u00e2ge. Ils contestent plut\u00f4t le fait que le personnel d\u2019EDSC a utilis\u00e9 des crit\u00e8res que la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation l\u2019obligeaient \u00e0 appliquer.\n[58] Les plaignants ne pr\u00e9tendent pas que la l\u00e9gislation ou la r\u00e9glementation auraient pu \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on non discriminatoire, mais ils semblent soutenir qu\u2019EDSC aurait pu exercer un certain pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans l\u2019application des r\u00e8gles. Il faut distinguer la situation en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de celle dans l\u2019affaire Beattie c. Canada (Affaires indiennes et du Nord), 2014 TCDP 1 [Beattie], o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait la possibilit\u00e9 de retenir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation l\u00e9gislative la plus compatible avec les principes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Dans l\u2019affaire Beattie, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a d\u2019abord refus\u00e9 le service en vertu de la loi, puis a accept\u00e9 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la plaignante. La capacit\u00e9 d\u2019accorder la r\u00e9paration de base sans modifier la loi existante distinguait l\u2019affaire Beattie de l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson et des plaintes en cause en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants n\u2019all\u00e8guent pas qu\u2019EDSC a mal interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les dispositions l\u00e9gislatives ou r\u00e9glementaires. Leurs plaintes reposent plut\u00f4t, pour l\u2019essentiel, sur une contestation du libell\u00e9 des dispositions elles-m\u00eames.\n[59] Les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es ne visaient pas la conduite de repr\u00e9sentants du minist\u00e8re, l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ni la mise en \u0153uvre de politiques et de lignes de conduite minist\u00e9rielles (Forward, au paragraphe 37). Comme la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (CAF) l\u2019a conclu dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin, les mesures prises par un organisme public pour le bien public ne peuvent transformer en un service ce qui de toute \u00e9vidence ne l\u2019est pas (Watkin, au paragraphe 33).\n[60] Si M. Huntley et les autres plaignants font parfois r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me ou \u00e0 un processus de demande difficile, ils n\u2019all\u00e8guent pas pour autant que c\u2019est la raison pour laquelle ils ont perdu leur admissibilit\u00e9 ni n\u2019expliquent comment un effet pr\u00e9judiciable est li\u00e9 \u00e0 leur invalidit\u00e9 ou \u00e0 leur \u00e2ge. Les plaignants contestent plut\u00f4t le R\u00e8glement et leurs plaintes reposent \u00ab pour l\u2019essentiel \u00bb sur cette contestation, comme la Commission l\u2019a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans chacun de ses rapports de d\u00e9cision. Ils contestent les dispositions qui les ont rendus inadmissibles \u00e0 des subventions et \u00e0 des bons apr\u00e8s avoir atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans ou qui ont limit\u00e9 les autres droits dont ils pouvaient jouir en l\u2019absence de ces plafonds l\u00e9gislatifs et r\u00e9glementaires.\n[61] Mais, comme le soutient EDSC, tous les fonctionnaires doivent fonder les mesures prises sur la loi, et leur autorit\u00e9 provient des lois et des r\u00e8glements qu\u2019EDSC applique. Il n\u2019existe aucun pouvoir permettant de verser des prestations qui ne sont pas pr\u00e9vues dans les lois ou les r\u00e8glements applicables.\n[62] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ma conclusion selon laquelle la source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans les plaintes en cause est le cadre l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e9glementaire, je dois maintenant d\u00e9cider si les all\u00e9gations rel\u00e8vent du champ d\u2019application de la Loi et si elles ont des chances raisonnables d\u2019aboutir.\nii) Si les plaintes portent uniquement sur la l\u00e9gislation et la r\u00e9glementation, est\u2011il manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019aboutir?\n[63] La r\u00e9ponse est oui. Il est bien \u00e9tabli que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour trancher les plaintes fond\u00e9es sur une contestation des lois. L\u2019article 5 de la Loi exige que les services habituellement offerts au grand public soient fournis sans discrimination (Beattie, au paragraphe 102). Cependant, l\u2019\u00e9laboration des lois n\u2019est pas un service habituellement offert au public, et la l\u00e9gislation ne constitue pas en soi un \u00ab service \u00bb (Andrews\/Matson, aux paragraphes 57 \u00e0 62).\n[64] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 certains plaignants continuent de contester les dispositions de la LCEI ou d\u2019autres lois, ces all\u00e9gations \u00e9chappent clairement \u00e0 la port\u00e9e de la Loi et doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\n[65] De m\u00eame, j\u2019estime que les contestations du R\u00e8glement par les plaignants n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019aboutir et ne peuvent pas aller de l\u2019avant.\n[66] La Commission soutient que les principes g\u00e9n\u00e9raux qui sous-tendent l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson et la jurisprudence concernant les plaintes qui contestent les dispositions de la loi sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 obligatoire s\u2019appliquent \u00e9galement au R\u00e8glement.\n[67] Je suis d\u2019accord. Tout comme dans l\u2019affaire Andrews\/Matson, o\u00f9 le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes en tant qu\u2019attaques directes contre la l\u00e9gislation, les plaignants soutiennent que le R\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame est discriminatoire. Ils ne pr\u00e9tendent pas qu\u2019un service a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert de fa\u00e7on in\u00e9gale, mais contestent plut\u00f4t le fait qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas pu avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des subventions et \u00e0 des bons ou b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier d\u2019autres avantages en raison des exigences non discr\u00e9tionnaires fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge qui figurent dans le R\u00e8glement. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019acte de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer relativement au R\u00e8glement en cause dans les plaintes n\u2019a pas la connotation transitive n\u00e9cessaire pour pouvoir \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un service destin\u00e9 au public (Andrews\/Matson, au paragraphe 62).\n[68] Les plaignants ne contestent pas la fa\u00e7on dont EDSC a trait\u00e9 leurs demandes, mais ciblent essentiellement les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 que celui-ci n\u2019avait d\u2019autre choix que d\u2019utiliser. La source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est le R\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame.\n[69] Bien que j\u2019estime que l\u2019analyse dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson s\u2019applique au R\u00e8glement en cause dans les plaintes, je dois mentionner qu\u2019EDSC a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions jurisprudentielles ant\u00e9rieures \u00e0 la conclusion de la Cour en ce qui concerne l\u2019acte de l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer. \u00c0 mon avis, ces d\u00e9cisions appuient davantage la conclusion selon laquelle la contestation du R\u00e8glement ne fait pas intervenir la prestation d\u2019un service. Ce n\u2019est pas la premi\u00e8re fois que le Tribunal et les cours de justice se penchent sur cette question, et je ne vois aucun motif de s\u2019\u00e9carter de cette approche dans l\u2019examen des plaintes en cause.\n[70] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bouvier, la CAF a maintenu la conclusion du juge des requ\u00eates selon laquelle la Commission n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour examiner les plaintes, pour mener une enqu\u00eate \u00e0 ce sujet et renvoyer les contestations au R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019examen de la vue et de l\u2019ou\u00efe des employ\u00e9s de chemin de fer (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Bouvier, 1998 CanLII 7409 (CAF), aux paragraphes 1, 4 et 5). Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Murphy, la CAF a maintenu la d\u00e9cision de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle une contestation de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-ch\u00f4mage et de son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application \u00ab ne porte sur aucun des actes pouvant faire l\u2019objet de plaintes sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP \u00bb. (Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada c. Canada (Agence du revenu), 2012 CAF 7. Enfin, dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mishibinjimi, la CAF a conclu que la Loi ne contient pas de disposition \u00e9quivalente au paragraphe 47(2) du Code des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario qui pr\u00e9voit express\u00e9ment la contestation des lois et r\u00e8glements (Mishibinijima c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 36, au paragraphe 40).\n[71] EDSC soutient \u00e9galement que les cours de justice ont conclu que les r\u00e8glements font partie du processus l\u00e9gislatif et que la promulgation de r\u00e8glements par l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif est un acte l\u00e9gislatif. EDSC s\u2019appuie sur le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation pancanadienne des valeurs mobili\u00e8res, dans lequel la Cour a conclu que \u00ab la l\u00e9gislature a comp\u00e9tence pour adopter elle\u2011m\u00eame des lois et pour d\u00e9l\u00e9guer \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes ou organismes certains pouvoirs administratifs ou r\u00e9glementaires, notamment le pouvoir de prendre des r\u00e8glements contraignants, mais subordonn\u00e9s \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation pancanadienne des valeurs mobili\u00e8res, 2018 CSC 48 (CanLII), [2018] 3 RCS 189), au paragraphe 73). La Cour ajoute qu\u2019il s\u2019agit parfois d\u2019un \u00ab pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif subordonn\u00e9 \u00bb et que les r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifs ne font souvent qu\u2019\u00e9noncer les grands objectifs de la l\u00e9gislature, de sorte que \u00ab le gros de la gouvernance se fai[t] d\u00e9sormais par voie r\u00e9glementaire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 des d\u00e9crets de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif \u00bb (Renvoi relatif \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation pancanadienne, citant B. McLachlin, C.P., Tribunaux administratifs et tribunaux judiciaires : une relation en \u00e9volution, 27 mai 2013 [en ligne]; voir aussi Hogg (5e \u00e9d.), p. 14\u20111 et 14\u20112, au paragraphe 73).\n[72] Dans le cadre du REEI, le R\u00e8glement fait une partie du \u00ab gros de la gouvernance \u00bb et contient des d\u00e9tails sur l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, sans quoi le r\u00e9gime d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 ne pourrait pas \u00eatre mis en \u0153uvre. Bien que les exigences fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge figurent dans le RCEI et non dans une loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, j\u2019admets que le pouvoir de les promulguer a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par la l\u00e9gislature et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de \u00ab r\u00e8glements contraignants, mais subordonn\u00e9s \u00bb, comme la Cour l\u2019a d\u00e9crit dans le Renvoi relatif \u00e0 r\u00e9glementation pancanadienne des valeurs mobili\u00e8res.\n[73] La source du pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9dicter le RCEI permet \u00e9galement de conclure qu\u2019une contestation du R\u00e8glement ne constitue pas un service. Le R\u00e8glement est pris en vertu de la loi habilitante, la LCEI, qui pr\u00e9voit que\u00ab [l]e gouverneur en conseil peut, par r\u00e8glement, prendre toute mesure d\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi \u00bb (art. 17, LCEI). L\u2019article 17 de la LCEI contient une liste non exhaustive de ce que le R\u00e8glement peut pr\u00e9voir, y compris les exigences \u00e0 remplir par un r\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 avant que des subventions ou des bons puissent \u00eatre vers\u00e9s relativement au r\u00e9gime, la fa\u00e7on de d\u00e9terminer le montant des subventions et des bons et les r\u00e8glements r\u00e9gissant le remboursement de ces montants.\n[74] \u00c0 mon avis, le r\u00e9sultat serait absurde si seulement une plainte ciblant la loi (la LCEI ou la LIR dans les plaintes en cause) \u00e9tait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme ne relevant pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, alors qu\u2019une contestation du R\u00e8glement promulgu\u00e9 en vertu de cette m\u00eame loi, sans lequel l\u2019objet et les intentions du l\u00e9gislateur ne pourraient pas \u00eatre r\u00e9alis\u00e9s, serait consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme relevant de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal et comme un \u00ab service \u00bb habituellement offert au public. Le l\u00e9gislateur avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9l\u00e9guer ce pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9dicter le R\u00e8glement, qui d\u00e9coule de la LCEI, et les dispositions r\u00e9glementaires compl\u00e8tent le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif d\u2019application du syst\u00e8me d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux r\u00e9gimes d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9. J\u2019estime \u00e9galement que l\u2019orientation donn\u00e9e par la CAF dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bouvier est applicable \u00e0 mon analyse, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019un minist\u00e8re \u2013 en l\u2019occurrence EDSC \u2013 ne peut \u00eatre tenu responsable d\u2019un r\u00e8glement \u00ab pour la seule raison que le l\u00e9gislateur le charge d\u2019appliquer la loi en vertu de laquelle ce r\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 valablement pris par le gouverneur en conseil \u00bb (Bouvier, au paragraphe 4).\n[75] Les plaignants soutiennent que si j\u2019applique au R\u00e8glement le raisonnement de l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson, je mettrai \u00e0 l\u2019abri les activit\u00e9s men\u00e9es par des entit\u00e9s administratives f\u00e9d\u00e9rales comme EDSC. Ils ajoutent que, bien que l\u2019\u00e9laboration des lois soit assujettie \u00e0 de vastes m\u00e9canismes de contr\u00f4le dans nos syst\u00e8mes d\u00e9mocratiques, les r\u00e8glements, qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s du tout dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson, sont r\u00e9dig\u00e9s par des membres non \u00e9lus de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif. Ils affirment que l\u2019application du raisonnement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements pourrait inciter les parlementaires et les acteurs gouvernementaux \u00e0 int\u00e9grer les aspects controvers\u00e9s d\u2019une politique en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00e0 des r\u00e8glements afin de les prot\u00e9ger de l\u2019examen pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi. Ils font valoir qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait d\u2019un recul pour les droits de la personne et que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la cons\u00e9quence pr\u00e9vue de l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson.\n[76] Or, comme le soutient EDSC, le R\u00e8glement n\u2019est pas r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par des membres non \u00e9lus de l\u2019ex\u00e9cutif avec contrepoids moins d\u00e9mocratiques, comme le pr\u00e9tendent les plaignants. Le R\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 adopt\u00e9 par le gouverneur en conseil, compos\u00e9 de membres du niveau ex\u00e9cutif du gouvernement (le premier ministre et le Cabinet), qui sont \u00e9lus et responsables devant les Canadiens. De plus, le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9dicter ce R\u00e8glement a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur dans la loi habilitante. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une situation o\u00f9 des r\u00e8gles arbitraires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies sans aucun pouvoir et qui ont un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur les personnes poss\u00e9dant une caract\u00e9ristique particuli\u00e8re.\n[77] Le R\u00e8glement peut refl\u00e9ter des choix de politique avec lesquels les plaignants ne sont pas d\u2019accord, mais il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal de remettre en question les choix faits par le gouverneur en conseil. Je n\u2019ai pas le pouvoir de modifier les r\u00e8glements cr\u00e9\u00e9s par le \u00ab pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif subordonn\u00e9 \u00bb dans le cas des plaintes en cause, tout comme je n\u2019ai pas le pouvoir de modifier les lois promulgu\u00e9es par la l\u00e9gislature. Je ne peux pas non plus ordonner que les prestations soient vers\u00e9es contrairement \u00e0 la loi ou au r\u00e8glement applicable.\n[78] Je comprends la frustration des plaignants qui ne peuvent pas contester le cadre l\u00e9gislatif devant notre Tribunal. Ils se sont exprim\u00e9s de vive voix et par \u00e9crit au sujet des aspects du programme qu\u2019ils trouvent injustes et difficiles d\u2019acc\u00e8s. Toutefois, je ne peux pas ordonner le changement d\u2019un syst\u00e8me cr\u00e9\u00e9 par le l\u00e9gislateur. Ce serait outrepasser mes pouvoirs et commettre une erreur de droit. Comme le fait valoir la Commission, les plaignants doivent contester les dispositions en cause devant les cours de justice.\n[79] Pour ces motifs, il est manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations mettant en cause le cadre l\u00e9gislatif et les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la loi et dans le R\u00e8glement n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019aboutir et doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es.\n3. Les all\u00e9gations administratives peuvent-elles aller de l\u2019avant?\n[80] Les plaintes peuvent \u00e9voluer. Toutefois, l\u2019\u00e9volution doit toujours respecter l\u2019essence de la plainte et ne saurait comporter une plainte substantiellement nouvelle qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par la Commission (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada, 2021 CF 969, au paragraphe 215 [Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien], et Casler c. La Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2017 TCDP 6, aux paragraphes 7 \u00e0 11).\n[81] La port\u00e9e d\u2019une plainte est d\u00e9termin\u00e9e non seulement par le formulaire de plainte, mais aussi par les expos\u00e9s de pr\u00e9cisions qui tiennent lieu de plaidoiries dans les proc\u00e9dures de la LCDP (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien, au paragraphe 153). La substance de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions doit raisonnablement respecter les fondements factuels et les all\u00e9gations initiales de discrimination tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la plainte initiale (Karas c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne du sang et Sant\u00e9 Canada, 2021 TCDP 2, au paragraphe 24; Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2017 TCDP 28, aux paragraphes 69-70).\ni) Les all\u00e9gations administratives ont-elles un lien suffisant avec les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal?\n[82] La r\u00e9ponse est non. La Commission a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes qui contestent les dispositions du R\u00e8glement concernant l\u2019\u00e2ge limite et la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9. Les all\u00e9gations administratives sont apparues pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions de la Commission et des plaignants, lorsque la Commission a entrepris de d\u00e9finir les deux volets dans le cadre des plaintes, \u00e0 savoir les all\u00e9gations concernant la fa\u00e7on dont EDSC a promu et administr\u00e9 le REEI, en plus des contestations du R\u00e8glement qui constituaient l\u2019essence des plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es.\n[83] Dans les quatre expos\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le cadre des plaintes en cause, la Commission all\u00e8gue que les plaignants ont eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 acc\u00e9der au Programme en raison, entre autres, [traduction] \u00ab des choix et des mesures discr\u00e9tionnaires du Canada en mati\u00e8re de conception des programmes \u00bb, d\u2019une proc\u00e9dure de demande complexe et \u00e0 plusieurs niveaux, d\u2019une publicit\u00e9 inad\u00e9quate du programme, d\u2019un manque de communication et, plus g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement, de retards dans ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit comme une proc\u00e9dure de demande on\u00e9reuse.\n[84] La Commission soutient \u00e9galement que les plaintes concernent une discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Elle pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il existe des preuves claires et coh\u00e9rentes que les personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 touch\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on disproportionn\u00e9e par la conception et l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du Programme canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 par EDSC et que leur incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer pleinement au programme a permis d\u2019accro\u00eetre leur marginalisation et les d\u00e9savantages sur le plan financier. Elle indique qu\u2019une grande majorit\u00e9 des Canadiens handicap\u00e9s admissibles \u00e2g\u00e9s de 18 \u00e0 49 ans n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de demande de r\u00e9gime d\u2019\u00e9pargne ni de subventions et de bons entre 2008 et 2016.\n[85] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. Huntley all\u00e8gue qu\u2019EDSC et le gouvernement ont alourdi le processus de demande pour les personnes handicap\u00e9es et non handicap\u00e9es, et que le gouvernement du Canada et EDSC savaient d\u00e9j\u00e0, par l\u2019entremise de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada, qui \u00e9tait admissible, de sorte que cette complexit\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas lieu d\u2019\u00eatre. Il affirme que la participation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faible, qu\u2019il y a eu une confusion totale quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter une demande, et que l\u2019arr\u00eat Andrews\/Matson est maintenant invoqu\u00e9 pour se donner carte blanche afin d\u2019\u00e9viter les diff\u00e9rends au sujet des services gouvernementaux.\n[86] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, Mme Alkerton mentionne son invalidit\u00e9, mais s\u2019insurge surtout contre le fait qu\u2019elle ne peut pas b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de subventions et de bons en raison des [traduction] \u00ab restrictions inh\u00e9rentes au programme \u00bb, soulignant les restrictions d\u2019\u00e2ge et le fait qu\u2019un agent financier de son institution financi\u00e8re ne disposait pas de beaucoup de renseignements. Elle aussi a d\u00e9crit le processus de demande comme \u00e9tant complexe et mal promu. Elle soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019avantage \u00e0 ouvrir le REEI parce qu\u2019il n\u2019offre pas les m\u00eames avantages qu\u2019aux personnes de moins de 49 ans.\n[87] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. McGregor all\u00e8gue avoir fait l\u2019objet de discrimination pour cause de d\u00e9ficience parce qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas avoir acc\u00e8s aux prestations, car il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une p\u00e9riode d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 en raison de cette m\u00eame d\u00e9ficience. Il pr\u00e9tend que le syst\u00e8me de subventions et de bons et les dispositions de report sont discriminatoires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes qui vivent une invalidit\u00e9 ou un traumatisme plus tard dans la vie et plus pr\u00e8s de l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans.\n[88] M. Dorey \u00e9crit dans son expos\u00e9 des positions que, lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis au courant du REEI, il a communiqu\u00e9 avec sa banque et son gestionnaire de placements et a eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir des renseignements. Il parle des limites d\u2019\u00e2ge et de leur incidence sur la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9, ainsi que des plafonds pour les subventions et les bons. Il poursuit en disant que lorsqu\u2019on [traduction] \u00ab applique exactement les m\u00eames politiques \u00e0 deux personnes diff\u00e9rentes, l\u2019une de 36 ans et l\u2019autre de 46 ans, m\u00eame si leur situation est identique \u00e0 tous les autres \u00e9gards, selon l\u2019\u00c2GE SEULEMENT, ces deux personnes re\u00e7oivent des prestations diff\u00e9rentes, ce qui constitue une pratique discriminatoire fond\u00e9e sur le motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est l\u2019\u00e2ge. \u00bb\n[89] Les plaignants et la Commission soutiennent que les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s de cette derni\u00e8re ont toujours fait \u00e9tat des all\u00e9gations administratives. La Commission soutient que l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle l\u2019administration du Programme est discriminatoire constitue [traduction] \u00ab un aspect fondamental de la discrimination v\u00e9cue par chaque plaignant \u00bb.\n[90] Je ne souscris pas \u00e0 cette qualification. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les all\u00e9gations administratives ne sont rien de plus que des contestations des crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 maintenant appel\u00e9es des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019\u00ab administration \u00bb du Programme, elles ne peuvent pas aboutir parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas de lien suffisant avec ce que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal. Bien que les plaignants, et en particulier M. Huntley, aient pu \u00e9crire que le Programme pr\u00eatait \u00e0 confusion et \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 appliquer et \u00e0 comprendre, les plaintes ne reposent pas, pour l\u2019essentiel, sur ces aspects, et les questions que la Commission a choisi de renvoyer non plus.\n[91] La Commission s\u2019appuie sur les d\u00e9cisions du Tribunal qui \u00e9tayent la proposition selon laquelle elle n\u2019est pas tenue de proc\u00e9der par enqu\u00eate et examiner chaque aspect d\u2019une plainte ni de modifier une plainte avant de la renvoyer au Tribunal (Connors c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2019 TCDP 6, aux paragraphes 39 \u00e0 40; Jorge c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2021 TCDP 25 [Jorge]). La Commission soutient que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions pr\u00e9cisent et compl\u00e8tent les plaintes et d\u00e9finissent la port\u00e9e de l\u2019audience. Elle conteste l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019EDSC selon laquelle le processus d\u2019examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 contourn\u00e9 par ce qu\u2019il qualifie de \u00ab d\u00e9tails \u00bb fournis dans les expos\u00e9s de la Commission et des plaignants. Elle s\u2019appuie \u00e9galement sur la d\u00e9cision Letnes c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2019 TCDP 41, au paragraphe 5 [Letnes], pour affirmer qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019apporter des pr\u00e9cisions dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne lorsque de nouveaux faits ou de nouvelles circonstances sont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9s, et qu\u2019il est \u00e9galement possible d\u2019apporter des modifications \u00e0 tout stade de l\u2019action afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que l\u2019expos\u00e9 refl\u00e8te de fa\u00e7on correcte et \u00e9quitable les questions en litige entre les parties \u00e0 une plainte. La Commission soutient que les all\u00e9gations administratives, loin d\u2019ouvrir une nouvelle voie d\u2019enqu\u00eate impr\u00e9vue, s\u2019appuient sur des all\u00e9gations d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulev\u00e9es.\n[92] Je n\u2019accepte pas les observations formul\u00e9es par la Commission \u00e0 ce sujet. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une situation o\u00f9 un d\u00e9tail ou un aspect secondaire qui n\u2019a pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un examen a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9 aux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions. EDSC soutient que les all\u00e9gations contenues dans les expos\u00e9s sont vagues et qu\u2019elles sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 d\u2019autres probl\u00e8mes, comme il sera pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 plus loin. Mais, \u00e0 mon avis, le probl\u00e8me fondamental tient au fait que les all\u00e9gations ouvrent la porte \u00e0 un tout autre type d\u2019enqu\u00eate au sujet de l\u2019omission reproch\u00e9e \u00e0 EDSC de promouvoir ou d\u2019administrer ad\u00e9quatement le REEI, qui est discriminatoire envers les plaignants du fait de leur d\u00e9ficience. La Commission soutient que les plaintes comprennent des all\u00e9gations syst\u00e9miques de discrimination qui touchent les personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Ces plaintes ont une port\u00e9e tr\u00e8s large. Mais ce ne sont pas les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal.\n[93] La Commission affirme qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure si le Tribunal proc\u00e8de \u00e0 l\u2019instruction des all\u00e9gations administratives parce que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e9noncent [traduction] \u00ab l\u2019ensemble des all\u00e9gations contre EDSC qui d\u00e9coulent des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les plaignants \u00bb. Or, m\u00eame si tel \u00e9tait le cas, l\u00e0 n\u2019est pas la question. Il n\u2019est pas question de savoir si les expos\u00e9s sont \u00ab complets \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t de savoir si les all\u00e9gations administratives, \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans les expos\u00e9s, ont un lien suffisant avec les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es. \u00c0 mon avis, les expos\u00e9s ouvrent une nouvelle voie non pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une instruction et ne devraient pas \u00eatre autoris\u00e9s (Gaucher c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), 2005 TCDP 1, cit\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Letnes, au paragraphe 8).\n[94] La Commission soutient que les observations d\u2019EDSC sont fond\u00e9es sur une mauvaise compr\u00e9hension du r\u00f4le de la Commission avant le renvoi par rapport \u00e0 celui du Tribunal. Elle s\u2019appuie sur la d\u00e9cision Jorge, dans laquelle le Tribunal explique que le formulaire de plainte fournit un aper\u00e7u de la plainte et n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement un expos\u00e9 exhaustif d\u2019une longue s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents de discrimination per\u00e7ue, compte tenu des contraintes d\u2019espace et du fait que la partie qui le remplit peut agir pour son propre compte. Le formulaire de plainte n\u2019est pas un acte de proc\u00e9dure et n\u2019est pas destin\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on stricte ou \u00e9troite. Le fait d\u2019exiger des d\u00e9tails pr\u00e9cis au moment de la plainte initiale peut causer un pr\u00e9judice injuste au plaignant (Jorge, aux paragraphes 67 \u00e0 83).\n[95] Les observations sur les r\u00f4les fondamentaux de la Commission et du Tribunal ne sont pas utiles dans les circonstances. Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que la Commission doit enqu\u00eater sur les plaintes et d\u00e9cider de les renvoyer ou non et que, une fois le renvoi effectu\u00e9, le Tribunal instruit la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e. Mais le Tribunal ne peut entendre des plaintes qui ne sont pas suffisamment li\u00e9es \u00e0 ce que la Commission lui a envoy\u00e9 ni ouvrir une nouvelle voie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations qui sont formul\u00e9es pour la premi\u00e8re fois devant lui.\n[96] De plus, les faits et les circonstances de l\u2019affaire Jorge se distinguent de ceux en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que leTribunal ait accueilli les modifications propos\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire Jorge, il a conclu que les faits s\u2019ins\u00e9raient dans le r\u00e9cit de la plainte et qu\u2019ils se situaient dans le \u00ab prolongement \u00bb des faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s. Il s\u2019agissait d\u2019exemples suppl\u00e9mentaires du m\u00eame type d\u2019actes discriminatoires que ceux pr\u00e9cis\u00e9s dans la plainte (Jorge, au paragraphe 100).\n[97] J\u2019estime que les all\u00e9gations administratives ne se situent pas dans \u00ab le prolongement \u00bb des faits d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9s. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de nouveaux exemples de faits suppl\u00e9mentaires qui compl\u00e8tent ou renforcent le r\u00e9cit de ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9. Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, les plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es reposaient, pour l\u2019essentiel, sur la contestation des limites fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge pr\u00e9vues dans le R\u00e8glement. Les all\u00e9gations administratives ne font pas partie du m\u00eame r\u00e9cit et ne sont pas simplement un \u00ab peaufinement \u00bb de ce qui constitue une attaque contre le R\u00e8glement.\n[98] La Commission soutient que les plaignants sont tous des personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience et qu\u2019ils ont tous fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 dans leur formulaire de plainte et pendant l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Mais le fait de mentionner qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience \u2013 ce qui n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 \u2013 ne d\u00e9finit pas l\u2019essence de la plainte. \u00c0 part indiquer sans ambages que les all\u00e9gations administratives faisaient partie des plaintes initiales, la Commission ne corrobore pas son affirmation selon laquelle il y a un lien suffisant avec les plaintes initiales. Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, les plaintes reposent plut\u00f4t, pour l\u2019essentiel, sur une contestation du R\u00e8glement, que la Commission croyait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque correspondre \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations que le Tribunal pouvait entendre.\n[99] Mme Alkerton soutient que le programme \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab con\u00e7u et cens\u00e9 \u00eatre offert \u00e0 une personne ayant une incapacit\u00e9 admissible \u00bb, mais j\u2019accepte l\u2019argument d\u2019EDSC selon lequel ce sont les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qui font l\u2019objet de sa contestation, lorsqu\u2019elle affirme que [traduction] \u00ab les restrictions li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge constituent l\u2019obstacle et m\u00e8nent \u00e0 la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur [s]on \u00e2ge \u00bb. De m\u00eame, bien que M. McGregor soit devenu invalide plus tard dans sa vie et qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience parce qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas pr\u00e9senter une demande pendant qu\u2019il \u00e9tait frapp\u00e9 d\u2019incapacit\u00e9, c\u2019est le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif qui a limit\u00e9 son admissibilit\u00e9. En ce qui le concerne, M. Huntley d\u00e9crivait dans sa plainte initiale le programme comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab complexe et d\u00e9routant \u00bb, mais il ne pr\u00e9cisait pas en quoi ces caract\u00e9ristiques \u00e9taient li\u00e9es \u00e0 son invalidit\u00e9. M\u00eame si j\u2019accepte l\u2019argument de la Commission selon lequel l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 est un motif implicite, je ne peux pas conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre ces all\u00e9gations et les plaintes initiales, qui portaient sur une contestation du R\u00e8glement.\n[100] Il est concevable que les plaignants aient pu all\u00e9guer avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u00e9s\u00e9s par la fa\u00e7on dont un service a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni ou par les mesures prises par EDSC dans l\u2019administration et la promotion du Programme, mais il ne s\u2019agit pas de l\u2019objet des plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es au Tribunal.\n[101] La Commission tente de se servir du fait incontest\u00e9 que les plaignants sont tous des personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience pour \u00e9tablir un lien entre les all\u00e9gations administratives et les plaintes qui ont effectivement \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es, ce qui est loin de faire \u00ab partie du m\u00eame r\u00e9cit \u00bb.\n[102] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es par les plaignants en vue de d\u00e9terminer si les all\u00e9gations administratives s\u2019inscrivent dans la port\u00e9e des plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es. J\u2019accepte l\u2019argument d\u2019EDSC selon lequel les r\u00e9parations que recherchent tous les plaignants concernent le paiement de prestations. Les plaignants voudraient que la LCEI et le RCEI soient modifi\u00e9s de sorte qu\u2019ils puissent \u00eatre admissibles aux subventions qu\u2019ils auraient pu recevoir. M. Dorey demande que des modifications soient apport\u00e9es aux dispositions applicables, notamment au regard de la r\u00e9troactivit\u00e9 continue ou de l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 invers\u00e9e qui ne peuvent pas \u00eatre r\u00e9voqu\u00e9es et de la possibilit\u00e9 pour une personne d\u2019acheter le plein montant, et il veut aussi s\u2019assurer que les cotisants peuvent retirer de l\u2019argent sans p\u00e9nalit\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019ils le souhaitent.\n[103] Mme Alkerton demande le versement du montant maximal \u00e0 vie des subventions et des bons afin de tenir compte des dix ann\u00e9es \u00e9coul\u00e9es depuis la cr\u00e9ation du REEI et du temps qu\u2019elle a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 donner suite \u00e0 la plainte.\n[104] M. McGregor demande 2 000 $ en subventions pour les ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 il avait 48 et 49 ans, en plus des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et sp\u00e9ciaux. Il demande que des changements syst\u00e9miques soient apport\u00e9s au REEI afin de modifier les dispositions de report et les contraintes li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge.\n[105] Enfin, tandis que M. Huntley parle de [traduction] \u00ab changements \u00e0 la politique et au libell\u00e9 \u00bb, ce qu\u2019il demande, c\u2019est une modification des dispositions r\u00e9glementaires afin que lui-m\u00eame et d\u2019autres puissent reporter l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux bons et aux subventions jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans, mais \u00e0 partir d\u2019une date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de demande apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e2ge de 49 ans jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la limite d\u2019\u00e2ge ou la limite de report, selon ce qui survient en premier. Il demande aussi le versement de 2 000 $ en bons.\n[106] Je suis d\u2019accord avec EDSC pour dire que, par les r\u00e9parations sollicit\u00e9es, les plaignants visent les limites d\u2019\u00e2ge r\u00e9glementaires et me demandent d\u2019ordonner le versement de prestations auxquelles ils n\u2019avaient pas droit. Ces r\u00e9parations ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations autres qu\u2019une contestation du cadre l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e9glementaire. En demandant le montant maximal \u00e0 vie des subventions et des bons, Mme Alkerton conteste le R\u00e8glement et sa propre inadmissibilit\u00e9 aux subventions et aux bons. Par ses demandes de r\u00e9paration, M. McGregor montre de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on que sa plainte concerne le R\u00e8glement lui-m\u00eame. M. Huntley demande explicitement des modifications au libell\u00e9 des dispositions. Enfin, bien que M. Dorey vise, par ses demandes, le libell\u00e9 de la LCEI et du R\u00e8glement, il cherche \u00e9galement \u00e0 obtenir une mesure de r\u00e9paration relative \u00e0 la promotion du programme, bien qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un aspect qui concerne n\u00e9cessairement des tiers. Il inclut \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard une lettre de son conseiller financier. Or, il ne s\u2019agit l\u00e0 que de pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 son conseiller financier et \u00e0 la Banque TD, qui ne remettent pas en cause EDSC.\n[107] Je n\u2019accepte pas non plus l\u2019affirmation de la Commission selon laquelle le fait de permettre l\u2019instruction des all\u00e9gations administratives ne causerait aucun pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 EDSC. Les all\u00e9gations administratives ne pr\u00e9cisent pas les d\u00e9fis que posent les exigences d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 fond\u00e9es sur l\u2019\u00e2ge pr\u00e9vues dans le R\u00e8glement.\n[108] Je suis d\u2019accord avec EDSC pour dire que les plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on tr\u00e8s inhabituelle. La Commission soutient que les all\u00e9gations administratives devraient aller de l\u2019avant, tout en faisant valoir qu\u2019elles sont li\u00e9es \u00e0 des plaintes qui, selon elle, ne peuvent \u00eatre instruites par le Tribunal. La Commission peut bien croire que c\u2019est ce qu\u2019elle nous a renvoy\u00e9, mais je dois m\u2019assurer de la capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal d\u2019y donner suite. De simples d\u00e9clarations selon lesquelles les all\u00e9gations administratives \u00e9taient \u00ab un aspect fondamental de la discrimination v\u00e9cue par chaque plaignant \u00bb ne permettent pas d\u2019\u00e9tablir un lien avec les plaintes initiales ni \u00e0 ramener les all\u00e9gations administratives dans les limites de ces m\u00eames plaintes.\n[109] Autoriser l\u2019instruction de ces all\u00e9gations porterait pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 EDSC. Les all\u00e9gations administratives ne sont pas li\u00e9es en fait et en droit aux plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es. Cette situation est injuste, et le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 EDSC ne peut \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9, car ce dernier n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter ses arguments au stade de la Commission ni de se pr\u00e9valoir des m\u00e9canismes pr\u00e9vus par la Loi, par exemple en pr\u00e9sentant des demandes en irrecevabilit\u00e9 ou en demandant le contr\u00f4le judiciaire des actions et des d\u00e9cisions de la Commission (Karas, au paragraphe 140).\n[110] La Commission soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de pr\u00e9judice pour EDSC, car celui-ci est au courant depuis des ann\u00e9es des probl\u00e8mes li\u00e9s \u00e0 la promotion du Programme et que M. Huntley et M. McGregor mentionnent l\u2019invalidit\u00e9 dans leurs plaintes. Elle dit aussi que les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions traitent de toute fa\u00e7on de l\u2019ensemble des all\u00e9gations des plaignants et de la Commission.\n[111] Je ne peux pas non plus contourner le cadre existant applicable aux plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, simplement par souci de c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9. C\u2019est une erreur de droit que de faire fi du cadre l\u00e9gislatif et des r\u00f4les respectifs de la Commission et du Tribunal que le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9tablis.\n[112] Je comprends la frustration des plaignants sur ce point et ce r\u00e9sultat. Les plaignants veulent contester les seuils d\u2019\u00e2ge et les r\u00e8gles d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019ils jugent discriminatoires et qui ont des r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur eux et sur d\u2019autres Canadiens atteints d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Ils veulent \u00e9galement changer ce qu\u2019ils consid\u00e8rent comme un syst\u00e8me de demande compliqu\u00e9 et complexe qui, selon eux, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 ad\u00e9quatement promu ni administr\u00e9. Mais je ne peux pas contourner le pouvoir l\u00e9gislatif qui r\u00e9git le Tribunal et son mandat ni ignorer la loi contraignante ou choisir de mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 des principes juridiques pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer un processus et tenir une audience sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de leurs plaintes.\n[113] Les parties sont libres de demander \u00e0 une cour de justice de proc\u00e9der au contr\u00f4le judiciaire de ma d\u00e9cision, et si la cour trouve une erreur, elle en informera le Tribunal. Mais je ne peux pas commettre ce que je crois \u00eatre une erreur manifeste, susceptible de r\u00e9vision, au nom de la c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9. Le Tribunal est un organisme cr\u00e9\u00e9 par une loi. Je ne ferais pas mon travail si je ne travaillais pas dans les limites de la loi qui r\u00e9git ce que je fais en tant que d\u00e9cideur administratif dans le syst\u00e8me des droits de la personne que le l\u00e9gislateur a \u00e9tabli.\n[114] La Commission soutient que le fait de conclure que les all\u00e9gations administratives d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte [traduction] \u00ab emp\u00eacherait les parties qui agissent pour leur propre compte de voir leurs exp\u00e9riences de discrimination faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une instruction et d\u2019une d\u00e9cision par le Tribunal, et si les plaintes sont jug\u00e9es fond\u00e9es, d\u2019obtenir des r\u00e9parations \u00bb. Mais comme la Commission le sait bien, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas une tribune \u00e0 laquelle les plaignants peuvent acc\u00e9der directement pour pr\u00e9senter des plaintes relatives \u00e0 la discrimination. Sous le r\u00e9gime du syst\u00e8me f\u00e9d\u00e9ral des droits de la personne, la Commission est l\u2019organisme habilit\u00e9 \u00ab \u00e0 recevoir, \u00e0 administrer et \u00e0 traiter les plaintes relatives \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires \u00bb (Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Warman, 2012 CF 1162, au paragraphe 55). La Commission doit mener des enqu\u00eates exhaustives pour s\u2019acquitter de la responsabilit\u00e9 que la Loi lui impose (Oleson c. Premi\u00e8re Nation de Wagmatcook, 2019 TCDP 35, au paragraphe 30). \u00c0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale rappelant qu\u2019elle n\u2019est pas tenue d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur chaque d\u00e9tail ou aspect d\u2019une plainte, la Commission n\u2019a pas v\u00e9ritablement r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation d\u2019EDSC portant qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas men\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les all\u00e9gations administratives.\n[115] Le Tribunal ne peut pas non plus traiter toutes les all\u00e9gations d\u2019iniquit\u00e9. Le Tribunal ne peut entendre et trancher que les affaires que lui renvoie la Commission. Tout comme je ne peux pas contourner la jurisprudence contraignante, je ne peux pas assumer une partie du r\u00f4le que le l\u00e9gislateur voulait que la Commission joue. Comme j\u2019estime que ces questions n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00fbment soumises \u00e0 la Commission, je ne peux pas, de ma propre initiative ou parce que les parties me l\u2019ont demand\u00e9, ignorer les tenants et aboutissants de ce que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal.\n[116] Je ne peux pas non plus corriger le fait que les all\u00e9gations que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es \u00e9chappent \u00e0 la port\u00e9e du Tribunal du fait qu\u2019elle ajoute maintenant des all\u00e9gations qui, \u00e0 mon avis, ne sont pas suffisamment li\u00e9es aux plaintes qu\u2019elle a renvoy\u00e9es.\n[117] EDSC \u00e9nonce un certain nombre d\u2019autres raisons pour lesquelles je ne devrais pas autoriser les all\u00e9gations administratives, notamment le fait qu\u2019elles sont vagues et impr\u00e9cises, qu\u2019elles mettent en question les mauvais fournisseurs de services (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire les institutions financi\u00e8res) qui ouvrent des REEI pour des particuliers et leur fournissent des conseils financiers, qu\u2019elles portent sur des faits qui remontent \u00e0 plus de dix ans, qu\u2019elles reposent sur une pr\u00e9misse erron\u00e9e selon laquelle \u00ab l\u2019ignorance de la loi \u00bb donne lieu \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de discrimination, et qu\u2019elles ne se rapportent pas aux r\u00e9parations recherch\u00e9es. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 aborder toutes ces questions, car j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que les all\u00e9gations administratives n\u2019\u00e9taient pas suffisamment li\u00e9es aux plaintes que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9es. Je conviens toutefois avec EDSC que la Commission n\u2019a aucunement abord\u00e9 plusieurs de ces probl\u00e8mes au fond en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC.\n[118] Enfin, bien que je doive rejeter ces plaintes parce que je suis tenue de suivre les principes juridiques et le cadre l\u00e9gislatif qui guident le travail du Tribunal, je f\u00e9licite les plaignants qui ont agi pour leur propre compte dans le cadre d\u2019un processus long et difficile devant la Commission et le Tribunal. Ils ont mis au premier plan les questions importantes qui sous-tendent les plaintes et leurs r\u00e9percussions sur les personnes atteintes d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience. Dans leurs arguments, ils ont formul\u00e9 des propositions individuelles et collectives quant \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration du Programme canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9, ce qui ajoute une contribution importante \u00e0 toute discussion strat\u00e9gique sur les mesures de soutien pour les Canadiens handicap\u00e9s et leurs familles. Bien que le Tribunal ne soit pas l\u2019organisme indiqu\u00e9 en ce qui concerne les changements qu\u2019ils recherchent, j\u2019esp\u00e8re que leurs voix seront entendues et prises en compte \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur des proc\u00e9dures qui lui sont propres.\nVI.

APER\u00c7U [1] Le plaignant, Bernard Schulz, souhaitait ouvrir un r\u00e9gime enregistr\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (\u00ab REEI \u00bb), mais l\u2019article 146.4 de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. (1985), ch. 1 (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb), \u00e9tablit \u00e0 59 ans l\u2019\u00e2ge limite pour l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 \u00e0 un REEI, qui est n\u00e9cessaire pour se pr\u00e9valoir de la subvention canadienne pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 et du bon canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9. Les subventions et les bons sont \u00e9galement assujettis \u00e0 des limites d\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 (le \u00ab R\u00e8glement \u00bb). M. Schulz soutient qu\u2019Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada (\u00ab EDSC \u00bb) a fait preuve \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge et la d\u00e9ficience parce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas pu pr\u00e9senter de demande de REEI et d\u2019avantages connexes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que sa ni\u00e8ce l\u2019aide, alors qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 59 ans. Il affirme que les limites d\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans la LIR et le R\u00e8glement touchent de fa\u00e7on disproportionn\u00e9e les a\u00een\u00e9s et les personnes handicap\u00e9es en raison des difficult\u00e9s auxquelles ils sont confront\u00e9s lorsqu\u2019ils pr\u00e9sentent une demande d\u2019avantages, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une forme de discrimination syst\u00e9mique.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9, EDSC, est le minist\u00e8re du gouvernement du Canada qui \u00e9labore, g\u00e8re et ex\u00e9cute les programmes et les services sociaux. EDSC fait valoir que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire la plainte de M. Schulz parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une contestation inadmissible de la loi qui doit \u00eatre soumise aux tribunaux judiciaires.\n[3] M. Schulz reconna\u00eet qu\u2019une contestation de la LIR ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal. Il poursuit \u00e9galement sa contestation devant une cour de justice et il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de financement pour d\u00e9fendre sa cause, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les limites d\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9tablies dans la LIR et le R\u00e8glement vont \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des protections garanties par la Charte canadienne des droits et libert\u00e9s, partie I de la Loi constitutionnelle de 1982, constituant l\u2019annexe B de la Loi de 1982 sur le Canada (R.-U.), 1982, ch. 11 (la \u00ab Charte \u00bb). Toutefois, il fait valoir que le Tribunal peut tout de m\u00eame entendre sa contestation du R\u00e8glement. Sa plainte pourrait \u00e9galement comporter un troisi\u00e8me volet, soit les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles EDSC aurait administr\u00e9 et promu le REEI de fa\u00e7on discriminatoire (\u00ab les all\u00e9gations r\u00e9siduelles \u00bb).\n[4] M. Schulz demande au Tribunal de tenir sa plainte en suspens pendant une autre ann\u00e9e, le temps qu\u2019il pr\u00e9pare sa contestation judiciaire et pr\u00e9sente une nouvelle demande de financement pour plaider sa cause. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 accueilli deux demandes de mise en suspens dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier : Schulz (au nom de Bernard Schulz) c. Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2022 TCDP 6 [Schulz 1], et Schulz (au nom de Bernard Schulz) c. Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2022 TCDP 33 [Schulz 2].\n[5] La Commission ne se prononce pas sur la demande de M. Schulz.\n[6] EDSC s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la nouvelle demande de mise en suspens de 12 mois. Il convient qu\u2019un ajournement plus court est justifi\u00e9, mais que celui-ci doit \u00eatre li\u00e9 \u00e0 la date \u00e0 laquelle le Tribunal rendra sa d\u00e9cision dans le cadre des plaintes connexes. Dans ces dossiers connexes, EDSC a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en radiation des all\u00e9gations des plaignants qui contestent le R\u00e8glement, car il est d\u2019avis que celles-ci d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e de la Loi. EDSC soutient que l\u2019issue de cette requ\u00eate pourrait r\u00e9gler la question de la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal \u00e0 trancher une contestation du r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif r\u00e9gissant le REEI. Il demande au Tribunal de planifier une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire avec les parties dans les 40 jours suivant le prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision dans les dossiers connexes. Selon l\u2019issue de ces dossiers, M. Schulz pourrait choisir d\u2019abandonner sa plainte et EDSC pourrait pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en radiation de sa plainte, ou les parties pourraient \u00eatre en mesure de d\u00e9poser leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions.\nII. D\u00c9CISION\n[7] Je rejetterai la nouvelle demande de mise en suspens de 12 mois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant. Le Tribunal a rendu sa d\u00e9cision dans les dossiers connexes et a conclu que les contestations du R\u00e8glement ne sont pas des services au sens de la Loi et n\u2019ont aucune chance raisonnable de succ\u00e8s. \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de cette d\u00e9cision, j\u2019accorderai un ajournement de 45 jours pour permettre aux parties d\u2019examiner la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et d\u2019\u00e9tablir leur position. M. Schulz doit indiquer s\u2019il compte aller de l\u2019avant avec sa plainte devant le Tribunal et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, sur quel fondement il s\u2019appuiera.\nIII. CONTEXTE [8] M. Schulz a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de financement dans le cadre du Programme de contestation judiciaire (le \u00ab Programme \u00bb) pour entreprendre une contestation judiciaire fond\u00e9e sur la Charte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la LIR et du R\u00e8glement. J\u2019ai accueilli la demande de M. Schulz et j\u2019ai report\u00e9 de six mois sa proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal afin de lui donner la chance d\u2019obtenir une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande de financement (Schulz 1). Sa demande de financement dans le cadre du Programme a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e. Il a ensuite demand\u00e9 une autre mise en suspens pour tenter d\u2019obtenir du financement en vue de poursuivre sa d\u00e9marche de contestation judiciaire.\n[9] J\u2019ai accueilli la deuxi\u00e8me demande de M. Schulz et j\u2019ai prorog\u00e9 la mise en suspens de six mois, soit jusqu\u2019en avril 2023 (Schulz 2). J\u2019ai \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli des \u00e9ch\u00e9ances \u00e0 l\u2019intention des parties pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de mise en suspens.\n[10] M. Schulz demande au Tribunal de proroger la mise en suspens jusqu\u2019au 5 avril 2024. Il a obtenu du financement pour \u00e9laborer sa cause pendant une p\u00e9riode de douze mois, mais il n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune aide financi\u00e8re pour commencer \u00e0 la plaider. Il veut que le Tribunal mette sa plainte en suspens pour une autre ann\u00e9e pour lui donner le temps d\u2019\u00e9laborer sa cause et de pr\u00e9senter une nouvelle demande de financement en vue d\u2019entamer sa contestation judiciaire. Il affirme que le groupe d\u2019experts du Programme se r\u00e9unit trois fois par ann\u00e9e et qu\u2019il esp\u00e8re avoir une d\u00e9cision d\u00e9finitive \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de sa demande d\u2019ici le 5 avril 2024.\n[11] La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate dans l\u2019affaire connexe (Jamus Dorey, Karolin Alkerton, David Huntley et Roderick McGregor c Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2023 TCDP 23) a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue le 15 juin 2023 [Dorey].\n[12] Dans cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, le Tribunal a accueilli la requ\u00eate d\u2019EDSC et a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que celles-ci attaquaient directement la loi et les exigences obligatoires pr\u00e9vues dans le R\u00e8glement. Le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour instruire les plaintes parce que les droits non discr\u00e9tionnaires pr\u00e9vus dans le R\u00e8glement, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des dispositions contenues dans la loi, ne constituaient pas des services offerts par EDSC. Il a \u00e9galement conclu que les all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 l\u2019administration et \u00e0 la promotion par EDSC du Programme canadien pour l\u2019\u00e9pargne-invalidit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas comprises dans la plainte renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait donc impossible d\u2019y donner suite.\n[13] Lorsque la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de M. Schulz au Tribunal, elle a utilis\u00e9 son processus simplifi\u00e9, dans le cadre duquel les parties peuvent pr\u00e9senter leurs observations directement \u00e0 un membre de la Commission. La Commission a appliqu\u00e9 le paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), et a renvoy\u00e9 la plainte au Tribunal parce qu\u2019elle ne pouvait r\u00e9gler la situation \u00e0 l\u2019origine des all\u00e9gations au moyen d\u2019une \u00e9valuation. En vertu du paragraphe 49(1) de la Loi, la Commission peut renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal \u00e0 toute \u00e9tape post\u00e9rieure au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte. Dans le compte rendu de sa d\u00e9cision accompagnant la lettre de renvoi, la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte semblent \u00eatre essentiellement les m\u00eames que celles soulev\u00e9es dans trois autres plaintes pour lesquelles des rapports d\u2019enqu\u00eate ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9s et communiqu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Alkerton, Huntley et McGregor). Elle a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 dans son renvoi que M. Huntley all\u00e9guait qu\u2019EDSC avait fait preuve \u00e0 son \u00e9gard de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge relativement \u00e0 la fourniture d\u2019un service.\n[14] La Commission a conclu que la plainte devait \u00eatre renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction afin que celui-ci juge si la limite d\u2019\u00e2ge pour l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 aux subventions et aux bons est discriminatoire. Elle a \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9 plusieurs raisons \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son renvoi, dont le fait qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment \u00e9valu\u00e9 et renvoy\u00e9 d\u2019autres plaintes comportant les m\u00eames all\u00e9gations que celles soulev\u00e9es par M. Schulz.\nIV. MOTIFS [15] Les parties n\u2019ont pas encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, alors je ne dispose que du formulaire de plainte ainsi que de la lettre de renvoi et du compte rendu de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission qui l\u2019accompagne pour essayer de comprendre ce sur quoi porte la plainte et ce que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 au Tribunal. Dans sa plainte, M. Schulz conteste la LIR et les dispositions non discr\u00e9tionnaires du R\u00e8glement, \u00e0 l\u2019instar des plaignants dans l\u2019affaire Dorey. La lettre de renvoi et le compte rendu de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission expliquent \u00e9galement que M. Schulz soul\u00e8ve essentiellement les m\u00eames questions que dans l\u2019autre instance. Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Dorey, le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 ces all\u00e9gations au motif qu\u2019elles n\u2019avaient aucune chance raisonnable d\u2019\u00eatre retenues. M. Schulz doit donc confirmer les parties de sa plainte qu\u2019il compte poursuivre avant que je puisse examiner s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019autoriser un nouvel ajournement ou une nouvelle prorogation de la mise en suspens dans l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se o\u00f9 il irait de l\u2019avant avec les m\u00eames all\u00e9gations que celles qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9es dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Dorey.\n[16] EDSC soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019une mise en suspens de 12 mois va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des deux d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 rendues par le Tribunal dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier. Je suis du m\u00eame avis. Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Schulz 1, j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que le processus d\u2019instruction du Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une police d\u2019assurance ou une solution de rechange. Or, c\u2019est exactement ainsi que M. Schulz consid\u00e8re le processus du Tribunal lorsqu\u2019il me demande de mettre sa plainte en suspens pendant une autre ann\u00e9e en attendant de savoir s\u2019il recevra du financement d\u2019ici le 5 avril 2024. Si M. Schulz ne re\u00e7oit pas le financement d\u2019ici un an, proc\u00e9dera-t-il seulement sur les all\u00e9gations r\u00e9siduelles devant notre Tribunal? Le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, quelles sont ses all\u00e9gations et ont-elles bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission?\n[17] M. Schulz a indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment que s\u2019il ne recevait pas le financement pour pr\u00e9senter sa demande devant les tribunaux judiciaires, il avait l\u2019intention de revenir devant notre Tribunal pour proc\u00e9der sur les parties de sa plainte qui, selon lui, rel\u00e8vent de notre comp\u00e9tence. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. Schulz avait soutenu que le reste des all\u00e9gations, y compris la contestation du R\u00e8glement ainsi que les all\u00e9gations r\u00e9siduelles, pouvait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 devant l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des juridictions (Schulz 2, au par. 9).\n[18] Tant que je ne saurai pas ce que le plaignant entend plaider devant notre Tribunal et que je n\u2019aurai pas examin\u00e9 la position respective des parties \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Dorey, je ne pourrai pas d\u00e9terminer la fa\u00e7on juste et efficace de proc\u00e9der dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. J\u2019ajournerai l\u2019instance pour une p\u00e9riode de 45 jours et j\u2019annulerai les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances pr\u00e9alablement \u00e9tablies pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t et la communication des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions afin de permettre aux parties de tenir compte des r\u00e9percussions de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Dorey et de permettre aux avocats d\u2019obtenir des instructions. Le greffe planifiera une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire qui se tiendra apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration de ce d\u00e9lai de 45 jours.\n[19] Les parties pr\u00e9senteront par \u00e9crit leur position et les prochaines \u00e9tapes qu\u2019elles proposent avant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire afin que nous puissions faire bon usage de notre temps.\nV. ORDONNANCE [20] La demande de mise en suspens de 12 mois pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le plaignant est rejet\u00e9e. L\u2019instance est ajourn\u00e9e pour une p\u00e9riode de 45 jours. Toutes les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances pr\u00e9alablement \u00e9tablies pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t et la communication des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions sont suspendues jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[21] Le greffier planifiera une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire qui aura lieu au plus t\u00f4t dans 45 jours pour discuter des prochaines \u00e9tapes avec les parties. Lorsque la date de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire sera fix\u00e9e, le Tribunal \u00e9tablira les \u00e9ch\u00e9ances pour que les parties pr\u00e9sentent leur position quant aux prochaines \u00e9tapes propos\u00e9es avant la tenue de cette conf\u00e9rence.\n[22] Le greffier enverra aux parties une copie de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Dorey avec la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nSign\u00e9e par\nJennifer Khurana\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 21 juin 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T2729\/10521\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Katheryne Schulz (au nom de Bernard Schulz) c.

Elle concerne aussi la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019employeur.\nMme Young et M. Sawchuk travaillaient comme pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives chez VIA Rail. Mme Young s\u2019est plainte du comportement que M. Sawchuk manifestait \u00e0 son \u00e9gard sur leur lieu de travail pendant deux ans. Plusieurs incidents t\u00e9moignent de ce comportement offensant. Par exemple, M. Sawchuk observait Mme Young d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019accomplissement de son propre travail. Une fois, lorsqu\u2019elle lui a demand\u00e9 de quitter la cabine de la locomotive, il a refus\u00e9 de le faire. M. Sawchuk lui lan\u00e7ait des injures et faisait des commentaires grossiers et peu professionnels en personne et par radio, notamment en utilisant des insultes et un langage sexistes. Il l\u2019a rabaiss\u00e9 devant ses coll\u00e8gues pour le ton de sa voix de femme et a critiqu\u00e9 ses v\u00eatements. Il s\u2019est tenu tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s d\u2019elle dans des circonstances qui la d\u00e9stabilisaient. Il a impos\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young de communiquer avec lui par le canal de radio commun seulement, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient \u00e0 proximit\u00e9. Il l\u2019a critiqu\u00e9e publiquement apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle a effectu\u00e9 une man\u0153uvre qu\u2019il avait lui-m\u00eame ordonn\u00e9e. Il a essay\u00e9 de l\u2019intimider par des moyens qui compromettaient la s\u00e9curit\u00e9.\nLe Tribunal a conclu que chaque incident, pris individuellement, pouvait sembler sans importance. Cependant, leur effet cumulatif sur pr\u00e8s de deux ans a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 des habitudes, voire une campagne, de harc\u00e8lement et d\u2019abus. Ensemble, ces incidents constituaient un traitement d\u00e9favorable. Le sexe, qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessairement le facteur principal ou m\u00eame intentionnel du traitement d\u00e9favorable, y a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le. Pour ces raisons, le comportement de M. Sawchuk \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe en cours d\u2019emploi.\nComme M. Sawchuk agissait de mani\u00e8re importune et persistante, Mme Young en a inform\u00e9 l\u2019employeur. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal a conclu que le comportement de M. Sawchuk constituait \u00e9galement du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe. Toutefois, ce comportement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de nature sexuelle et ne constituait donc pas du harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\nLe Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que VIA \u00e9tait responsable des actions de son employ\u00e9, M. Sawchuk. VIA n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 avoir pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher ces actes ou pour en att\u00e9nuer les effets. VIA n\u2019a pas pris assez au s\u00e9rieux les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Young. VIA n\u2019a pas agi avec diligence pour pr\u00e9venir le comportement discriminatoire. VIA disposait d\u2019une politique en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sur le lieu de travail, mais a plut\u00f4t choisi d\u2019appliquer son code de conduite. C\u2019est seulement apr\u00e8s des mois d\u2019aggravation des dommages que VIA est intervenue. De plus, il y avait peu de documents et de d\u00e9tails sur l\u2019enqu\u00eate, et la d\u00e9cision finale de VIA n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de fa\u00e7on ind\u00e9pendante.\nLe Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 VIA de verser une compensation financi\u00e8re. Il a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 des mesures de r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9miques visant \u00e0 assurer la mise en place par VIA de politiques et de proc\u00e9dures ad\u00e9quates en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne et de lutte contre le harc\u00e8lement.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2023 TCDP\n25\nDate : le\n27 juin 2023\nNum\u00e9ro du dossier :\nT2225\/4717\nEntre :\nJennifer Young\nla plaignante\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nVIA Rail Canada Inc.\nl'intim\u00e9e\nD\u00e9cision\nMembre :\nKirsten Mercer\nTable des mati\u00e8res\nI.

Aper\u00e7u et r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision [1] Mme Jennifer Young (la \u00ab plaignante \u00bb ou \u00ab Mme Young \u00bb) all\u00e8gue que son employeur, VIA Rail Canada Inc. (l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab VIA \u00bb) doit r\u00e9pondre du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9 contre elle par son coll\u00e8gue, M. Kevin Sawchuck, lequel n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance. Mme Young s\u2019est r\u00e9clam\u00e9e \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard des protections pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) (contre la discrimination en cours d\u2019emploi) et \u00e0 l\u2019article 14 (contre le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb ou la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[2] Personne n\u2019a contest\u00e9 devant le Tribunal le fait que M. Sawchuk se soit livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une conduite pr\u00e9judiciable et non professionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Young. En fait, apr\u00e8s avoir conclu que la fa\u00e7on dont M. Sawchuk traitait Mme Young contrevenait au Code de conduite de la compagnie, VIA a inflig\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier des mesures disciplinaires importantes. VIA conteste toutefois que la conduite de M. Sawchuk ait \u00e9t\u00e9 discriminatoire au sens de la Loi, ou qu\u2019elle ait compris du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe ou du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. VIA conteste \u00e9galement sa responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite de M. Sawchuk.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a appuy\u00e9 la plainte pour discrimination de Mme Young et a soutenu que VIA \u00e9tait effectivement responsable de la conduite de M. Sawchuk en vertu de la Loi. En particulier, la Commission a fait valoir que VIA n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9pondu ad\u00e9quatement aux plaintes initiales de Mme Young au sujet de la conduite de M. Sawchuk et que l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne de VIA \u00e9tait inad\u00e9quate. Selon la Commission, VIA \u00e9tait donc responsable de la conduite de M. Sawchuk.\n[4] Pour les motifs expos\u00e9s ci-apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai conclu que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une conduite discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Young, en contravention de la Loi. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, j\u2019ai estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il a commis \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de Mme Young, dans le cours de l\u2019emploi de celle-ci, des actes assimilables \u00e0 de la discrimination et \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur le sexe. J\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que la conduite de M. Sawchuk n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de nature sexuelle et que, par cons\u00e9quent, il n\u2019y avait pas eu de violation qui d\u00e9clencherait les protections pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 14(2) de la Loi. J\u2019ai en outre conclu que VIA ne peut se d\u00e9gager de sa responsabilit\u00e9 l\u00e9gale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite en milieu de travail de son employ\u00e9, M. Sawchuk, dans la mesure o\u00f9 elle a omis de faire preuve de diligence raisonnable pour pr\u00e9venir ou att\u00e9nuer la conduite discriminatoire en cause.\nII. Questions en litige A. Questions pr\u00e9liminaires 1. \u00c9tat de la diversit\u00e9 des genres \u00e0 VIA : une tradition qui se poursuit [5] Le Tribunal prend acte du fait que, traditionnellement, les emplois dans le secteur ferroviaire au Canada (y compris la conduite et l\u2019entretien des trains) \u00e9taient majoritairement occup\u00e9s par des hommes.\n[6] Le Tribunal a mentionn\u00e9 ce contexte \u00e0 l\u2019audience, pendant les expos\u00e9s finaux, et VIA a choisi de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites suppl\u00e9mentaires sur ce point.\n[7] VIA a soutenu qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab aucune preuve \u00bb n\u2019indiquait que le centre de maintenance de Toronto (\u00ab CMT \u00bb) \u00e9tait un milieu de travail \u00e0 pr\u00e9dominance masculine et que [traduction] \u00ab la pr\u00e9sence et la contribution des femmes dans le milieu de travail, au centre de maintenance de Toronto, \u00e9taient bien \u00e9tablies \u00bb. VIA a admis que les trois gestionnaires concern\u00e9s par les faits de l\u2019affaire \u00e9taient tous des hommes, mais a fait valoir qu\u2019ils avaient tous re\u00e7u une formation ad\u00e9quate sur le harc\u00e8lement et sur le Code de conduite de VIA.\n[8] VIA a fait observer que Mme Leslie Selesnic avait jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le important dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate en milieu de travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que Mme Barbara Anne Blair y avait aussi particip\u00e9.\n[9] Malgr\u00e9 les arguments de VIA, la preuve permet de conclure que le CMT \u2014 et en particulier les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives du quart de nuit, les intervenants qui ont le plus directement pris part aux faits dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u2014 repr\u00e9sente un groupe de travailleurs traditionnellement masculin. Cette conclusion ne veut pas dire qu\u2019aucune femme n\u2019y travaille, car manifestement, tel n\u2019est pas le cas. Elle signifie plut\u00f4t que la plainte s\u2019inscrit dans un contexte en milieu de travail o\u00f9 les normes et les valeurs sont fa\u00e7onn\u00e9es par la culture dominante de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre, ici traditionnellement compos\u00e9e d\u2019hommes.\n[10] Au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente, les contr\u00f4leurs \u00e9taient tous de sexe masculin. Le superviseur de quart \u00e9tait aussi un homme et, dans son t\u00e9moignage, le cadre sup\u00e9rieur du CMT, M. Zeke Medeiros, a indiqu\u00e9 que le manque de diversit\u00e9 des genres dans ce milieu de travail \u00e9tait depuis fort longtemps un probl\u00e8me qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait engag\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre; il a d\u00e9fini le secteur ferroviaire comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] \u00ab industrie domin\u00e9e par les hommes \u00bb.\n[11] L\u2019affirmation de VIA selon laquelle rien ne permet au Tribunal de conclure que le CMT ou, de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le secteur ferroviaire, constitue historiquement un milieu de travail masculin, est tout simplement inexacte. En fait, je suis tr\u00e8s heureuse que M. Medeiros ait parl\u00e9 avec sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9, dans son t\u00e9moignage, de ses pr\u00e9occupations concernant la diversit\u00e9 des genres \u00e0 VIA, et au CMT en particulier. Il a fait remarquer qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u00bb o\u00f9 M. Sawchuk avait commenc\u00e9 son emploi au CMT, vers 1985, une seule femme y travaillait, et que pendant une dizaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es, on s\u2019\u00e9tait retrouv\u00e9 sans aucune femme au sein du service, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que Mmes Julie Trepanier et Teona Kindt soient embauch\u00e9es.\n[12] M. Medeiros a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait r\u00e9joui du recrutement de Mme Young dans le cadre du programme des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives, en affirmant qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab il \u00e9tait bon de voir une femme participer au programme \u00bb.\n[13] Si le Tribunal souligne que le secteur ferroviaire est domin\u00e9 de longue date par les hommes, c\u2019est parce qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre utile de bien saisir le contexte historique et normatif de la plainte pour pouvoir comprendre la discrimination et y rem\u00e9dier, si son existence est constat\u00e9e. L\u2019histoire n\u2019excuse pas la discrimination, pas plus que le fait de reconna\u00eetre cette histoire ne suppose qu\u2019un milieu de travail est condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 la revivre \u00e9ternellement.\n[14] Toutefois, tant que l\u2019on n\u2019aura pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de nommer et d\u00e9finir les fa\u00e7ons dont un privil\u00e8ge traditionnel et continu fa\u00e7onne un milieu de travail, on sera limit\u00e9 dans sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 rep\u00e9rer la discrimination lorsqu\u2019elle se manifeste et \u00e0 r\u00e9agir ad\u00e9quatement pour la pr\u00e9venir et la contrer.\n[15] Le Tribunal f\u00e9licite VIA des mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour veiller \u00e0 ce que son milieu de travail continue de refl\u00e9ter la pleine diversit\u00e9 des genres pr\u00e9sente dans les collectivit\u00e9s qu\u2019elle dessert, dont certaines ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9es par M. Medeiros dans son t\u00e9moignage. C\u2019est dans cet esprit de parvenir \u00e0 un milieu de travail exempt de discrimination que le Tribunal rend sa d\u00e9cision.\n2. La femme raisonnable par rapport \u00e0 la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances [16] \u00c0 la fin de l\u2019audience, apr\u00e8s avoir pu prendre connaissance des expos\u00e9s finaux des parties et tenu compte de la d\u00e9cision de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stadnyk c. Canada (Commission de l\u2019emploi et de l\u2019immigration), 2000 CanLII 15796 (CAF) [Stadnyk], j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties si mon analyse des agissements d\u00e9taill\u00e9s dans la plainte, ainsi que de la question de savoir si cette conduite aurait pu ou d\u00fb \u00eatre per\u00e7ue comme ind\u00e9sirable, devait se fonder sur la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances ou sur la norme de la femme raisonnable, et si une telle distinction \u00e9tait importante dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[17] VIA a fait valoir que l\u2019application de la norme de la femme raisonnable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce lui porterait pr\u00e9judice, car elle perdrait ainsi l\u2019occasion de convoquer deux des autres femmes qui ont travaill\u00e9 avec M. Sawchuk, et dont les t\u00e9moignages au sujet de la conduite de ce dernier auraient pu avoir eu une certaine incidence sur l\u2019analyse du Tribunal.\n[18] Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord.\n[19] Que l\u2019on applique la norme de la femme raisonnable \u00e9nonc\u00e9e par le Tribunal, et confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Stadnyk, ou la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances formul\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), 1999 CanLII 18902 (CF) [Franke] (sur laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9e pr\u00e9tend s\u2019appuyer), dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u2014 et, d\u2019ailleurs, dans la plupart des cas de harc\u00e8lement sexuel et fond\u00e9 sur le genre \u2014, la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances devrait en v\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00eatre une femme.\n[20] Le probl\u00e8me des relations de M. Sawchuk avec ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin et, en particulier, avec celles ne partageant pas ses vues sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019accomplir le travail d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux locomotives, \u00e9tait \u00e9vident pour toutes les parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance, et ce, d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part. Les rapports qu\u2019entretenait M. Sawchuk avec Mme Kindt et Mme Trepanier, ainsi qu\u2019avec d\u2019autres femmes avec lesquelles il interagissait en milieu de travail, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s \u00e0 maintes reprises tout au long de l\u2019audience et dans les observations des parties, y compris celles de VIA.\n[21] Malgr\u00e9 cela, VIA a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ne pas citer Mme Trepanier et Mme Kindt comme t\u00e9moins dans le cadre de l\u2019instance. Cette d\u00e9cision, prise pour des raisons que VIA seule conna\u00eet, a pour cons\u00e9quence que les affirmations faites \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet de la relation de travail de M. Sawchuk avec les femmes en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, et avec chacune d\u2019elles, ne puissent \u00eatre oppos\u00e9es aux deux femmes, et que leurs r\u00e9ponses ne puissent \u00eatre mises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve en contre-interrogatoire. Que les parties aient \u00e9t\u00e9 ou non surprises par les questions du Tribunal au sujet de l\u2019arr\u00eat Stadnyk, il est difficile de croire que ni l\u2019une ni l\u2019autre n\u2019\u00e9tait au courant de la relation de M. Sawchuk avec ses coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines. Le fait que VIA ait choisi, pour quelque motif que ce soit, de ne pas convoquer les coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin de M. Sawchuk ne permet pas maintenant de penser qu\u2019elle serait l\u00e9s\u00e9e par l\u2019examen, par le Tribunal, de ce qu\u2019une femme raisonnable (ou une personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances) percevrait comme une conduite importune.\n[22] Cela dit, je suis d\u2019avis que la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente plainte est une femme raisonnable. Et, en tout \u00e9tat de cause, je conclus qu\u2019il est loisible au Tribunal de se fonder sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Stadnyk, qui a pour lui force de pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent.\nB. Principales questions en litige\nLa conduite de M. Sawchuk envers Mme Young constitue-t-elle une contravention \u00e0 la Loi?\nLa conduite de M. Sawchuk constitue-t-elle, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la Loi, de la discrimination exerc\u00e9e en cours d\u2019emploi contre Mme Young en raison de son sexe, ou de son identit\u00e9 en tant que femme? La conduite de M. Sawchuk constitue-t-elle, au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 de Mme Young en tant que femme? La conduite de M. Sawchuk correspond-elle \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement sexuel au sens du paragraphe 14(2) de la Loi?\nEn cas de r\u00e9ponse affirmative \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des questions a, b ou c ci-dessus, VIA est-elle responsable de la conduite de M. Sawchuk, par application de l\u2019article 65 de la Loi? Dans l\u2019affirmative, quelles mesures de r\u00e9paration y a-t-il lieu d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de VIA?\nIII. Droit applicable [23] Tout au long de l\u2019audience relative \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte ainsi que dans leurs observations finales, les parties ont ax\u00e9 leurs observations sur le fait que la conduite de M. Sawchuk constituait du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, au sens de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP (en confondant parfois la notion de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe avec celle de harc\u00e8lement sexuel). Mme Young a \u00e9galement invoqu\u00e9 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP au soutien de sa plainte relative \u00e0 un traitement d\u00e9favorable subi en cours d\u2019emploi du fait de son identit\u00e9 de femme.\n[24] Aux termes de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP, constitue un acte discriminatoire le fait de d\u00e9favoriser un employ\u00e9 en cours d\u2019emploi pour un motif de distinction illicite. Quant \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la LCDP, il dispose que le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[25] Dans le cas d\u2019une plainte qui porte sur un traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi (alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP) tout comme dans le cas d\u2019une plainte pour harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail (article 14 de la LCDP), l\u2019analyse que doit r\u00e9aliser le Tribunal suppose de d\u00e9terminer la conduite discriminatoire adopt\u00e9e en milieu de travail \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un plaignant en raison d\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Toutefois, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re d\u2019analyse applicable par le Tribunal diff\u00e8re quelque peu pour chacun des motifs de plainte pr\u00e9vus par la Loi et invoqu\u00e9s en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, j\u2019analyserai ceux-ci individuellement ci\u2011apr\u00e8s.\ni. Discrimination en cours d\u2019emploi (al. 7b) de la LCDP) [26] Dans le contexte de l\u2019instruction d\u2019une plainte relative aux droits de la personne, c\u2019est au plaignant qu\u2019il revient, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape initiale, de s\u2019acquitter du fardeau de la preuve. On parle souvent de cet exercice comme de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement d\u2019une preuve prima facie de discrimination. L\u2019utilisation de cette expression latine est toutefois superflue, car elle rend le droit moins accessible aux Canadiennes et aux Canadiens et peut m\u00eame \u00eatre source de malentendus au sujet du droit applicable en mati\u00e8re de discrimination (voir les observations similaires dans Duverger c. Aeropro, 2019 TCDP 18 (CanLII), au par. 14 [Aeropro], Simon c. Premi\u00e8re Nation Abegweit, 2018 TCDP 31, au par. 51; voir aussi Emmet c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2018 TCDP 23, aux par. 53 et 54, et Vik v. Finamore (No 2), 2018 BCHRT 9).\n[27] Quel que soit le nom qu\u2019on lui donne, l\u2019\u00e9tape initiale de l\u2019instruction demeure la m\u00eame : il s\u2019agit, pour le Tribunal, de d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant a \u00e9tabli une preuve \u00ab [...] qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 RCS 536, au par. 28).\n[28] L\u2019analyse en trois \u00e9tapes relative \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations de discrimination a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9finie par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), [2012] RCS 61 [Moore], au paragraphe 33. Selon cette analyse, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer :\n1) qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la LCDP contre la discrimination;\n2) qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable;\n3) que le motif de distinction illicite a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[29] Ainsi, c\u2019est sur ce crit\u00e8re d\u2019analyse d\u00e9fini dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore que le Tribunal se fonde pour examiner les plaintes faisant \u00e9tat d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) de la LCDP (voir p. ex. Aeropro).\n[30] La preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire, pour le plaignant, de d\u00e9montrer que le motif prohib\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019unique facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable qu\u2019il a subi (Qu\u00e9bec (Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse) c. Bombardier Inc. (Bombardier A\u00e9ronautique Centre de formation)), [2015] RCS 789 [Bombardier]).\n[31] Une preuve directe de discrimination n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment n\u00e9cessaire, non plus que la preuve d\u2019une intention de commettre un acte discriminatoire n\u2019est obligatoire (voir Bombardier, aux par. 40 et 41). Souvent, la discrimination n\u2019est pas exerc\u00e9e ouvertement ou intentionnellement. Or, la question de l\u2019intention n\u2019est pas celle que le Tribunal doit trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Il doit plut\u00f4t d\u00e9terminer si la conduite en cause, peu importe l\u2019intention qui la motivait, a eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur Mme Young. Ce faisant, le Tribunal doit tenir compte de l\u2019ensemble des circonstances de la plainte pour pouvoir d\u00e9celer si de subtiles odeurs de discrimination s\u2019en d\u00e9gagent (voir Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP) [Basi]).\n[32] Le Tribunal peut tirer une conclusion de discrimination \u00e0 partir d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle si la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui des all\u00e9gations de discrimination rend une telle conclusion plus probable que n\u2019importe quelle autre conclusion ou hypoth\u00e8se possible (voir Basi). Cela dit, la preuve circonstancielle doit tout de m\u00eame pr\u00e9senter un rapport tangible avec la d\u00e9cision ou la conduite contest\u00e9e (voir Bombardier, au par. 88).\nii. Harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe (al. 14(1)c) de la LCDP) [33] Bien qu\u2019elle vise en fin de compte \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser quels sont les agissements qui constituent une conduite de nature discriminatoire, l\u2019analyse d\u2019une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 14 de la Loi suit une approche quelque peu diff\u00e9rente.\n[34] La notion de harc\u00e8lement n\u2019est pas d\u00e9finie dans la LCDP. Toutefois, la jurisprudence du Tribunal et des cours de r\u00e9vision a d\u00e9fini le cadre d\u2019analyse applicable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une plainte pour harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\n[35] Ainsi, dans la d\u00e9cision Morin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2005 TCDP 41 [Morin], le membre Athanasios D. Hadjis \u00e9crivait, aux paragraphes 245 et 246 :\n[245] Aux termes de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi, le fait de harceler un individu en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite.\n[246] Le harc\u00e8lement jug\u00e9 illicite aux termes de la Loi a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9fini de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme une conduite non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour la victime (Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd. 1989 CanLII 97 (CSC), [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la p. 1284; Rampersadsingh c. Wignall (no 2) (2002), 45 C.H.R.R. D\/237, au par. 40 (T.C.D.P.)). Dans Canada (RHC) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es) et Franke, 1999 CanLII 7907 (CF), [1999] 3 C.F. 653, aux par. 29 \u00e0 50 (C.F., 1re inst.) (Franke), la juge Tremblay-Lamer d\u00e9finit le crit\u00e8re servant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a harc\u00e8lement aux termes de la Loi. Pour \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte, il faut prouver ce qui suit :\ni. Il faut montrer que la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite de la partie intim\u00e9e est li\u00e9e au motif de distinction illicite invoqu\u00e9 dans la plainte (en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la couleur du plaignant). Cette d\u00e9monstration doit \u00eatre fond\u00e9e sur la norme de la personne raisonnable dans les circonstances entourant l\u2019affaire, en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit les normes de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\nii. Il faut prouver que les actes jug\u00e9s r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles \u00e9taient importuns. Afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019actes importuns, on tient compte de la r\u00e9action de la partie plaignante au moment o\u00f9 les pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s incidents de harc\u00e8lement se sont produits et on d\u00e9termine si celle-ci a express\u00e9ment montr\u00e9, par son comportement, que la conduite reproch\u00e9e \u00e9tait importune. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire dans tous les cas de d\u00e9terminer si un refus verbal a \u00e9t\u00e9 exprim\u00e9; le fait d\u2019omettre \u00e0 maintes reprises de r\u00e9pondre aux commentaires de l\u2019auteur du harc\u00e8lement constitue pour ce dernier une indication que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. La norme \u00e0 appliquer en vue d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la conduite est celle de la personne raisonnable dans les m\u00eames circonstances.\niii. Pour qu\u2019il y ait harc\u00e8lement, il faut habituellement la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition; toutefois, dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident peut suffire \u00e0 cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile. Ainsi, une seule agression physique peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement, mais une plaisanterie vulgaire, m\u00eame si elle est de mauvais go\u00fbt, ne suffira g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle est moins susceptible, \u00e0 elle seule, de cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail d\u00e9favorable. On se fonde \u00e9galement sur le crit\u00e8re objectif de la personne raisonnable pour \u00e9valuer cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment.\niv. Enfin, si un employeur fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une plainte ayant trait \u00e0 la conduite d\u2019un ou de plusieurs de ses employ\u00e9s, comme c\u2019est le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que la victime du harc\u00e8lement avise, si possible, l\u2019employeur de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante. Cette exigence existe lorsqu\u2019il y a chez l\u2019employeur un service du personnel ainsi qu\u2019une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et v\u00e9ritable en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, y compris des m\u00e9canismes de redressement appropri\u00e9s.\n[36] Dans la d\u00e9cision Morin, le Tribunal s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd. [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252 [Janzen] de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et sur la d\u00e9cision Franke de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, deux pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9s devant moi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[37] Les principes \u00e9tablis dans la d\u00e9cision Morin ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repris par notre Tribunal dans diverses autres d\u00e9cisions (voir p. ex. Aeropro, Dawson c. Postes Canada, 2008 TCDP 41, Hill c. Air Canada, 2003 TCDP 9, Alizadeh-Ebadi c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2017 TCDP 36, Croteau c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2014 TCDP 16, Day c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2007 TCDP 43, Stanger c.Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2017 TCDP 8 [Stanger], Siddoo c. Syndicat international des d\u00e9bardeurs et magasiniers, section locale 502, 2015 TCDP 21 [Siddoo], conf. par 2017 CF 678).\niii. Harc\u00e8lement sexuel (par. 14(2) de la LCDP) [38] La Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas de d\u00e9finition expresse du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Toutefois, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9fini le harc\u00e8lement sexuel comme \u00e9tant \u00ab une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour les victimes de harc\u00e8lement \u00bb. (Janzen). Au cours des d\u00e9cennies suivant sa formulation par la Cour supr\u00eame, cette interpr\u00e9tation de ce qui constitue du harc\u00e8lement sexuel a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e \u00e0 maintes reprises dans des d\u00e9cisions rendues par des cours de justice, des tribunaux administratifs (y compris notre Tribunal) et des arbitres d\u2019un bout \u00e0 l\u2019autre du Canada (voir, plus r\u00e9cemment, Peters c. United Parcel Service du Canada Ltd. et Gordon, 2022 TCDP 25 [Peters].)\n[39] Dans la d\u00e9cision Franke, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a statu\u00e9 que le Tribunal \u00e9tait tenu d\u2019appliquer le crit\u00e8re juridique pos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen. Elle a ainsi reformul\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments requis du crit\u00e8re:\n1) une conduite importune;\n2) une conduite de nature sexuelle;\n3) soit un comportement persistant, soit un seul incident grave.\nElle y a aussi ajout\u00e9 une quatri\u00e8me exigence :\n4) l\u2019obligation, pour l\u2019employ\u00e9, d\u2019aviser l\u2019employeur du harc\u00e8lement sexuel pr\u00e9sum\u00e9 lorsque l\u2019employeur dispose d\u2019un service des ressources humaines, et qu\u2019une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et efficace en mati\u00e8re de lutte contre le harc\u00e8lement sexuel ainsi que des m\u00e9canismes de redressement sont en place.\niv. Responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite d\u2019un employ\u00e9 (art. 65 de la LCDP) [40] Si le plaignant est en mesure de s\u2019acquitter du fardeau de preuve qui lui incombe, l\u2019intim\u00e9 pourra se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019une d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vue dans la LCDP, si possible, ou limiter sa responsabilit\u00e9, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, en vertu du paragraphe 65(2) de la LCDP. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, l\u2019intim\u00e9e cherche \u00e0 invoquer l\u2019article 65 pour limiter sa responsabilit\u00e9, dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal conclurait que la plainte de Mme Young est fond\u00e9e.\n[41] Le paragraphe 65(1) de la LCDP dispose que \u00ab les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s [...] avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association qui l\u2019emploie \u00bb. Selon le paragraphe 65(2), \u00ab la personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s\u2019il \u00e9tablit que l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu\u2019il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets \u00bb.\n[42] En effet, si le Tribunal conclut \u00e0 une conduite discriminatoire de la part d\u2019un employ\u00e9, l\u2019employeur peut \u00e9viter d\u2019\u00eatre tenu responsable de cette conduite s\u2019il parvient \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il ne l\u2019a pas approuv\u00e9e ni cautionn\u00e9e et qu\u2019il a r\u00e9agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnablement efficace pour y rem\u00e9dier ou l\u2019emp\u00eacher.\nIV. Analyse A. Mme Young a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une conduite discriminatoire [43] La plainte de Mme Young porte essentiellement sur le fait que M. Sawchuk a fait preuve de discrimination son \u00e9gard parce qu\u2019elle est une femme. Dans sa plainte, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, tout au long de l\u2019audience ainsi que dans sa plaidoirie, Mme Young a d\u00e9crit le traitement d\u00e9favorable dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime comme constituant du harc\u00e8lement, tout comme l\u2019a fait Commission.\n[44] Ainsi qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, deux dispositions de la Loi traitent du type de conduite ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Young, soit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b) et l\u2019article 14, qui sont tous deux mentionn\u00e9s dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure produits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bien que la conduite reproch\u00e9e soit la m\u00eame dans l\u2019un et l\u2019autre cas, l\u2019analyse que commande chacune des protections offertes par la Loi est quelque peu diff\u00e9rente. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019examinerai les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s par Mme Young et je tirerai des conclusions \u00e0 leur sujet, en analysant d\u2019abord la conduite en cause \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du crit\u00e8re applicable relativement \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b). J\u2019examinerai ensuite cette m\u00eame conduite compte tenu du crit\u00e8re que le Tribunal doit appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des questions de harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour le motif du sexe (al. 14(1)c)). Et, enfin, j\u2019examinerai le crit\u00e8re particulier relatif au harc\u00e8lement sexuel qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli par la jurisprudence pertinente du Tribunal.\n1. Traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi (al. 7b) de la LCDP) [45] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 dit plus haut, la m\u00e9thode suivie par le Tribunal pour analyser une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 7 de la Loi est d\u00e9crite dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore. Chacun des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans cet arr\u00eat sera examin\u00e9 ci-dessous, mais, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des observations des parties, les principales questions dont le Tribunal est saisi sont celles de savoir : 1) si, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la conduite all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie; et 2) si, selon toute vraisemblance, le sexe de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 son endroit.\n[46] Tout au long de l\u2019audience, et dans ses observations finales, VIA a confondu \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition les deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019analyse d\u00e9finie dans Moore (soit celui du traitement pr\u00e9judiciable et celui de l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien avec une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e). Par exemple, VIA a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 :\n[traduction]\nL\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, m\u00eame si certains incidents d\u00e9crits dans les all\u00e9gations pourraient constituer des diff\u00e9rends li\u00e9s \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail, il n\u2019y a aucune preuve de traitement d\u00e9favorable ou de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe ou le genre.\n[47] L\u2019amalgame entre ces deuxi\u00e8me et troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse vient brouiller la question centrale en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, \u00e0 savoir si le sexe de Mme Young a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 son endroit.\n[48] Pour pouvoir \u00e9valuer correctement si une plainte devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9clar\u00e9e fond\u00e9e, il convient d\u2019examiner \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le chacune des \u00e9tapes de l\u2019analyse.\n[49] Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal doit chercher \u00e0 savoir si la plaignante poss\u00e8de une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la Loi contre la discrimination. Deuxi\u00e8mement, il doit d\u00e9terminer si la plaignante a subi un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, ce qui ressort \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qui sera expos\u00e9 plus en d\u00e9tail ci-dessous. Troisi\u00e8mement, en supposant qu\u2019il y a bien eu traitement pr\u00e9judiciable, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans celui-ci, en gardant \u00e0 l\u2019esprit qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il se soit agi du seul, ou m\u00eame du principal facteur dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable; il suffit qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur.\ni. Caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e [50] Nul n\u2019a contest\u00e9 devant moi le fait que Mme Young est de sexe f\u00e9minin, et que le sexe est une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par la Loi.\nii. Traitement d\u00e9favorable [51] Dans sa plainte, Mme Young all\u00e8gue plus d\u2019une vingtaine d\u2019incidents qui, selon elle, constituent du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur son sexe. Au cours de l\u2019audience, certains de ces incidents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail, d\u2019autres n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s qu\u2019au passage, et d\u2019autres encore n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s du tout. Pour les fins de la pr\u00e9sente analyse, je me suis align\u00e9e sur les parties, en ce que mes motifs seront ax\u00e9s sur les faits ou les incidents qu\u2019elles ont mis en \u00e9vidence \u00e0 l\u2019audience, de m\u00eame que sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments ou les aspects de la plainte qui \u00e9taient les plus pertinents ou utiles pour rendre la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision (Turner, 2012 CAF 159 (CanLii) au par. 40, Constantinescu c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2022 TCDP 13, au par. 33).\n[52] \u00c0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et compte tenu de la propre d\u00e9finition du harc\u00e8lement donn\u00e9e par VIA, \u00e0 savoir [traduction] \u00ab tout acte importun qui humilie, offense ou intimide \u00bb, selon la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en tant que pi\u00e8ce par la compagnie dans le cadre de l\u2019instance, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 11 des incidents particuliers qui, selon les all\u00e9gations de Mme Young et de la Commission, constituaient une conduite discriminatoire, mais aussi l\u2019ensemble des interactions entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk au sujet desquelles le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages.\n[53] Nul n\u2019a tent\u00e9 s\u00e9rieusement de faire valoir que la conduite de M. Sawchuk n\u2019avait pas eu d\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable pour Mme Young. En fait, en plus des conclusions de VIA selon lesquelles les agissements de M. Sawchuk constituaient une violation du Code de conduite qui justifiait des mesures disciplinaires importantes, les t\u00e9moins, y compris les propres t\u00e9moins de VIA, ont qualifi\u00e9 la conduite de M. Sawchuk de [traduction] \u00ab grossi\u00e8re \u00bb, [traduction] \u00ab non professionnelle \u00bb, [traduction] \u00ab vulgaire \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab p\u00e9nible \u00bb.\n[54] Le caract\u00e8re pr\u00e9judiciable du traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young par M. Sawchuk a pratiquement \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnu \u00e0 l\u2019audience par VIA, en plus d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne men\u00e9e en milieu de travail par cette derni\u00e8re. J\u2019\u00e9tudierai tout de m\u00eame bon nombre des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s soulev\u00e9s dans la plainte et tirerai des conclusions \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard, vu que les d\u00e9tails qui s\u2019y rapportent sont pertinents pour l\u2019analyse que commande la derni\u00e8re \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, soit celle qui concerne le lien entre la conduite discriminatoire et le sexe ou l\u2019identit\u00e9 de Mme Young en tant que femme, lien ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par VIA.\n(1) Incidents particuliers all\u00e9gu\u00e9s s\u2019inscrivant dans la conduite de M. Sawchuk\nSurveillance et prise de photographies (janvier 2012)\n[55] Mme Young a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le premier incident d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail dans sa plainte \u00e9tait survenu en janvier 2012. M. Sawchuk, a-t-elle dit, l\u2019observait depuis l\u2019int\u00e9rieur de son v\u00e9hicule alors que Mme Young et son partenaire, M. Kanelopoulos, travaillaient au poste de ravitaillement. Mme Young a ajout\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk prenait des photos d\u2019elle pendant qu\u2019elle travaillait, que sa conduite globale \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab troublante \u00bb et qu\u2019elle la rendait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise.\n[56] M. Kanelopoulos, qui a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, a confirm\u00e9 les dires de Mme Young, bien que les deux t\u00e9moins aient admis qu\u2019ils se trouvaient \u00e0 bonne distance de M. Sawchuk au moment des faits.\n[57] Dans son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal, M. Sawchuk a admis s\u2019\u00eatre trouv\u00e9 sur les lieux au moment o\u00f9 cet incident se serait produit, mais il a ni\u00e9 avoir pris des photos de Mme Young. En r\u00e9ponse aux questions du Tribunal, M. Sawchuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas de ce qu\u2019il faisait au moment de l\u2019incident. M. Sawchuk a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 confront\u00e9 par le superviseur de quart, M. Gilbert Hamilton, au sujet des photos qu\u2019il aurait prises de Mme Young, il avait offert de laisser VIA examiner son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, vraisemblablement pour qu\u2019elle v\u00e9rifie s\u2019il y avait d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles preuves de ces photos. M. Hamilton avait alors refus\u00e9 d\u2019inspecter le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de M. Sawchuk ou de d\u00e9terminer autrement si quelque photo avait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise la nuit en question.\n[58] Le Tribunal a entendu de nombreux t\u00e9moins, y compris M. Sawchuk lui-m\u00eame, au sujet de l\u2019habitude qu\u2019il avait d\u2019observer le travail effectu\u00e9 par ses coll\u00e8gues pendant leur quart de travail et d\u2019ensuite signaler \u00e0 ceux-ci ou \u00e0 la direction que, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, il jugeait ce travail d\u00e9ficient.\n[59] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont je dispose, je conclus que M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent au poste de ravitaillement et qu\u2019il observait Mme Young pendant qu\u2019elle et M. Kanelopoulos accomplissaient leurs t\u00e2ches. J\u2019estime en outre que ce type de surveillance en milieu de travail exerc\u00e9e par un pair ou un coll\u00e8gue d\u00e9nu\u00e9 de toute responsabilit\u00e9 de supervision \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young \u00e9tait un comportement importun et susceptible d\u2019humilier, d\u2019offenser ou d\u2019intimider.\n[60] En revanche, \u00e0 partir de la preuve dont je dispose, je ne peux conclure que M. Sawchuk prenait alors des photos de Mme Young, m\u00eame si je crois que Mme Young en est convaincue. Il ne faut toutefois pas voir dans cette d\u00e9claration la conclusion que M. Sawchuk n\u2019a pas pris les photos. Je conclus plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Young et M. Kanelopoulos \u00e9taient \u00e0 bonne distance de M. Sawchuk, et compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de M. Sawchuk et du fait que M. Hamilton n\u2019a pas inspect\u00e9 le t\u00e9l\u00e9phone de celui-ci, je conclus que je ne suis pas en mesure de trancher dans un sens ou dans l\u2019autre la question de savoir si M. Sawchuk a pris des photos de Mme Young au cours de la nuit concern\u00e9e.\n[61] Bien qu\u2019il puisse \u00eatre d\u00e9sagr\u00e9able, importun ou \u2014 pour reprendre le terme de Mme Young \u2014 \u00ab troublant \u00bb, un seul incident de surveillance de coll\u00e8gues pendant leur travail est peu susceptible de suffire \u00e0 \u00e9tablir le bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte de harc\u00e8lement. Toutefois, je conclus que, combin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres traitements pr\u00e9judiciables ou importuns, cette conduite est pr\u00e9judiciable au sens de la Loi.\nPrestation de serment (janvier 2012)\n[62] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une semaine apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident d\u00e9crit ci-dessus survenu au poste de ravitaillement, elle et M. Sawchuk avaient eu un d\u00e9saccord sur la question de savoir si M. Sawchuk pouvait monter dans la cabine pendant qu\u2019elle effectuait un d\u00e9placement de train. Afin de se faire emmener d\u2019une zone de la gare de triage \u00e0 une autre, M. Sawchuk, comme c\u2019\u00e9tait parfois la pratique dans la gare de triage, \u00e9tait mont\u00e9 \u00e0 bord du train que Mme Young \u00e9tait charg\u00e9e de d\u00e9placer.\n[63] Il n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 que Mme Young \u00e9tait en droit, selon les r\u00e8gles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de demander \u00e0 M. Sawchuk de sortir de la cabine pendant qu\u2019elle effectuait le d\u00e9placement du train, ce dont M. Sawchuk devait \u00eatre au fait, vu sa connaissance et sa compr\u00e9hension approfondies des r\u00e8gles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 applicables au travail d\u2019un pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux locomotives.\n[64] Toutefois, selon la preuve dont je dispose, au lieu d\u2019agir de fa\u00e7on respectueuse et courtoise lorsque Mme Young lui a demand\u00e9 de quitter la cabine, M. Sawchuk a r\u00e9agi en ayant un acc\u00e8s de frustration, notamment en \u00e9mettant des jurons.\n[65] \u00c0 l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal, VIA a soutenu que les jurons n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 lanc\u00e9s par M. Sawchuk contre Mme Young, mais seulement en r\u00e9ponse au fait qu\u2019elle lui avait demand\u00e9 de quitter son environnement de travail pendant qu\u2019elle d\u00e9pla\u00e7ait le train. Je ne trouve pas cette distinction significative dans les circonstances, pas plus que le gestionnaire de VIA, M. Hamilton, qui a r\u00e9primand\u00e9 M. Sawchuk pour une conduite qu\u2019il a jug\u00e9e inacceptable.\n[66] Bien qu\u2019aucun t\u00e9moin n\u2019ait pu se souvenir des mots utilis\u00e9s par M. Sawchuk, je suis convaincue que cet incident constitue un comportement intimidant de la part de M. Sawchuk, et je conclus qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable au sens de la Loi.\n[67] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019incident, Mme Young a signal\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois \u00e0 la direction la conduite de M. Sawchuk. M. Hamilton a alors demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young de d\u00e9poser sa plainte par \u00e9crit, ce qu\u2019elle a fait le 2 janvier 2012. Mme Young y affirmait que M. Sawchuk l\u2019avait observ\u00e9e et photographi\u00e9e au poste de ravitaillement une semaine auparavant, et que la veille, il avait refus\u00e9 de quitter la cabine \u00e0 sa demande alors qu\u2019elle effectuait le d\u00e9placement d\u2019un train. Mme Young a inform\u00e9 VIA que M. Sawchuk avait lev\u00e9 le ton et lui avait cri\u00e9 des injures.\n[68] Je souligne ici \u2014 et j\u2019y reviendrai plus en d\u00e9tail dans mon analyse de la responsabilit\u00e9 de VIA \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite de M. Sawchuk en milieu de travail \u2014 que cette r\u00e9action excessive de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 la demande que lui avait adress\u00e9e Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la direction. Un tel comportement agressif et non professionnel de la part d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui connaissait bien les r\u00e8gles et les attentes li\u00e9es \u00e0 son travail aurait d\u00fb susciter chez VIA des pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un probl\u00e8me sous\u2011jacent appelant une surveillance, voire une enqu\u00eate, plus pouss\u00e9e.\n[69] Cependant, lorsque l\u2019affaire (ainsi que l\u2019incident all\u00e9gu\u00e9 de surveillance et de prise de photographies de Mme Young au poste de ravitaillement) a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Hamilton, celui-ci n\u2019a pas men\u00e9 d\u2019enqu\u00eate approfondie. Il n\u2019a pris aucune mesure pour arriver \u00e0 savoir si des photos de Mme Young avaient bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 prises (au-del\u00e0 du fait que de M. Sawchuk avait ni\u00e9 leur existence), et il ne semble pas non plus que VIA ait pris des mesures pour enqu\u00eater sur les raisons pour lesquelles M. Sawchuk avait r\u00e9pondu de fa\u00e7on aussi agressive \u00e0 la demande de sa coll\u00e8gue de quitter la cabine pendant sa man\u0153uvre de d\u00e9placement du train.\n[70] Bien que les observations finales de VIA indiquent que M. Hamilton [traduction] \u00ab a fait enqu\u00eate sur la question et l\u2019a r\u00e9solue \u00bb, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont suivi donnent \u00e0 penser que la question \u00e9tait loin d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9e ad\u00e9quatement.\nConduite dangereuse\n[71] Mme Young a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2012, peu apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9tendue r\u00e9solution de sa plainte par M. Hamilton, M. Sawchuk avait conduit un v\u00e9hicule de l\u2019entreprise de fa\u00e7on imprudente dans sa direction, dans la gare de triage, et qu\u2019il avait tent\u00e9 de l\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019obtenir des fournitures de l\u2019entrep\u00f4t.\n[72] Mme Young s\u2019est \u00e9galement plainte d\u2019un deuxi\u00e8me incident de conduite dangereuse qui, selon elle, aurait eu lieu en septembre 2013. Ce deuxi\u00e8me incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans le t\u00e9moignage de plusieurs t\u00e9moins, et Mme Young en a parl\u00e9 comme d\u2019une source d\u2019inqui\u00e9tude importante pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 personnelle.\n[73] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, vers le 18 septembre 2013, M. Sawchuk avait conduit le v\u00e9hicule de la compagnie de fa\u00e7on imprudente \u00e0 un passage \u00e0 niveau o\u00f9 elle \u00e9tait en train d\u2019effectuer le d\u00e9placement d\u2019un train. Mme Young, qui se souvenait tr\u00e8s bien des \u00e9v\u00e9nements de ce jour-l\u00e0, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son niveau d\u2019inqui\u00e9tude sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tait alors particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9 \u00e0 cause d\u2019un incident qui s\u2019\u00e9tait produit \u00e0 un passage \u00e0 niveau pr\u00e8s d\u2019Ottawa, o\u00f9 un train avait heurt\u00e9 un v\u00e9hicule de transport en commun et ainsi caus\u00e9 le d\u00e9c\u00e8s de six personnes. Mme Young a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le niveau de stress, cette nuit-l\u00e0 dans la gare de triage du CMT, \u00e9tait \u00e9lev\u00e9, et qu\u2019\u00e0 son avis, M. Sawchuk avait tent\u00e9 de l\u2019intimider pendant qu\u2019elle effectuait les d\u00e9placements de trains qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 assign\u00e9s.\n[74] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young au sujet de l\u2019incident de septembre 2013 a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par M. Kanelopoulos, qui a dit au Tribunal que M. Sawchuk avait conduit le v\u00e9hicule de l\u2019entreprise de fa\u00e7on imprudente au passage \u00e0 niveau, ce qui avait oblig\u00e9 M. Kanelopoulos \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab actionner les freins \u00bb ou \u00e0 s\u2019arr\u00eater brusquement. M. Kanelopoulos a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 M. Hamilton.\n[75] M. Sawchuk a \u00e9galement t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019incident. Il a ni\u00e9 avoir conduit le v\u00e9hicule au passage \u00e0 niveau d\u2019une mani\u00e8re destin\u00e9e \u00e0 intimider Mme Young. Il a corrobor\u00e9 l\u2019accident \u00e9vit\u00e9 de justesse, mais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas avoir vu le train, parce qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de feux \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re de celui-ci. M. Sawchuk a ajout\u00e9 n\u2019avoir pas cherch\u00e9 alors \u00e0 intimider Mme Young.\n[76] Au fil des nombreux t\u00e9moignages entendus par le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019audience, l\u2019observation selon laquelle M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait obs\u00e9d\u00e9 par les r\u00e8gles et par ce qu\u2019il percevait comme des probl\u00e8mes de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est revenue constamment. M. Sawchuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9crit \u00e0 maintes reprises comme \u00e9tant un [traduction] \u00ab maniaque du contr\u00f4le \u00bb obnubil\u00e9 par la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les r\u00e8gles.\n[77] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve attestant l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019avait M. Sawchuk du travail pendant le quart de nuit, son comportement vigilant dans la gare de triage et son obsession avou\u00e9e pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et vu le sentiment de conscience accrue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui r\u00e9gnait cette nuit-l\u00e0, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une collision mortelle entre un train et un v\u00e9hicule survenue plus t\u00f4t dans la journ\u00e9e, je ne trouve pas cr\u00e9dible que M. Sawchuk ait pu s\u2019\u00eatre approch\u00e9 d\u2019un passage \u00e0 niveau \u00e0 bord d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule sans avoir remarqu\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un train.\n[78] La preuve permet de conclure que l\u2019accident a bel et bien \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9vit\u00e9 de justesse et, bien que je ne croie pas que M. Sawchuk ait agi en pensant qu\u2019il mettait v\u00e9ritablement sa vie ou le train en danger, j\u2019estime que, selon toute vraisemblance, il \u00e9tait conscient de ce qu\u2019il faisait. Toutefois, m\u00eame si je conclus que Mme Young avait la conviction sinc\u00e8re que la conduite de M. Sawchuk constituait une tentative d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e de l\u2019intimider ou de la menacer, particuli\u00e8rement dans le climat d\u2019\u00e9motivit\u00e9 exacerb\u00e9e qui, selon ce qu\u2019elle a d\u00e9crit, r\u00e9gnait pendant le quart concern\u00e9, je ne dispose pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisants pour conclure que M. Sawchuk a commis un acte aussi imprudent de fa\u00e7on intentionnelle dans le but de nuire \u00e0 Mme Young.\nSe tenir derri\u00e8re Mme Young alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait pench\u00e9e\n[79] La plainte de Mme Young mentionne un incident qui, selon elle, aurait eu lieu en avril 2012. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk, qui conduisait une camionnette dans la gare de triage, avait immobilis\u00e9 son v\u00e9hicule directement derri\u00e8re elle alors qu\u2019elle agissait en tant que personne au sol pendant un d\u00e9placement de train. Mme Young \u00e9tait en train d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter une op\u00e9ration qui consistait \u00e0 aligner l\u2019attelage de deux wagons. Mme Young a expliqu\u00e9 que, pour pouvoir visualiser cet alignement, elle devait se pencher \u00e0 partir de la taille de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que sa ligne de vis\u00e9e corresponde au joint d\u2019attelage. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise, en tant que femme, de se pencher de cette fa\u00e7on alors que M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait assis dans un v\u00e9hicule \u00e0 quelques pieds derri\u00e8re elle. Il \u00e9tait clair, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young, qu\u2019elle se sentait expos\u00e9e et vuln\u00e9rable en se penchant de la sorte, compte tenu surtout de sa relation d\u00e9j\u00e0 tendue avec M. Sawchuk.\n[80] Le fait que cette interaction a eu lieu n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 devant moi \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Aucun des t\u00e9moins n\u2019a contredit le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young selon lequel elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sawchuk de s\u2019\u00e9loigner, mais, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019acc\u00e9der \u00e0 la demande de sa coll\u00e8gue, il avait refus\u00e9 de bouger, et affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait suffisamment d\u2019espace pour terminer la man\u0153uvre. Selon Mme Young, M. Sawchuk avait fait fi de sa demande. Lorsqu\u2019elle lui avait de nouveau demand\u00e9 de se d\u00e9placer, il avait refus\u00e9. Cette d\u00e9claration n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par aucun t\u00e9moin.\n[81] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir ensuite demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide \u00e0 M. Dor\u00e9, un gestionnaire qui se trouvait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9, mais que celui-ci avait refus\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir, en faisant remarquer qu\u2019elle avait suffisamment d\u2019espace pour ex\u00e9cuter la man\u0153uvre. Encore une fois, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young \u00e0 ce sujet a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par celui d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins.\n[82] Ce n\u2019est que lorsque Mme Young a refus\u00e9 de poursuivre la man\u0153uvre de d\u00e9placement du train que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est finalement \u00e9loign\u00e9 et que Mme Young a pu terminer la t\u00e2che.\n[83] Les t\u00e9moignages de nombreux t\u00e9moins \u2014 dont Mme Young, M. Sawchuk et M. Dor\u00e9 \u2014 entendus par le Tribunal \u00e0 propos des faits entourant cet incident \u00e9taient remarquablement coh\u00e9rents. Toutefois, \u00e0 l\u2019audience et dans ses observations finales, VIA a soutenu que les interactions en question \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab inexplicables \u00bb, tandis que Mme Young a clairement indiqu\u00e9 que le comportement en cause constituait la preuve d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9 sur son sexe.\n[84] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne se sentait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise de se pencher devant M. Sawchuk, un coll\u00e8gue masculin qui la rendait inconfortable et l\u2019effrayait, et dont elle avait trouv\u00e9 la conduite [traduction] \u00ab troublante \u00bb. Ni M. Dor\u00e9 ni M. Sawchuk ne semblent avoir compris la raison ou la nature de l\u2019inqui\u00e9tude de Mme Young et de son appel \u00e0 l\u2019aide.\n[85] Je conclus que M. Sawchuk a refus\u00e9 de se d\u00e9placer lorsque Mme Young l\u2019en a pri\u00e9 et que, lorsque celle-ci a sollicit\u00e9 l\u2019aide de M. Dor\u00e9, celui-ci a refus\u00e9 d\u2019intervenir. J\u2019estime en outre que, dans les m\u00eames circonstances, une personne raisonnable comprendrait que lorsqu\u2019un coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin avec lequel on a une relation tendue est assis dans un v\u00e9hicule derri\u00e8re soi, \u00e0 observer pendant qu\u2019on se penche, il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019une conduite pouvant \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9e comme pr\u00e9judiciable et importune.\n[86] Je reviendrai sur cette interaction au moment d\u2019analyser le lien entre le traitement d\u00e9favorable subi par Mme Young et son sexe, mais il est clair que ni au moment des faits, ni par la suite, VIA n\u2019a compris ce qui pouvait \u00eatre p\u00e9nible pour Mme Young dans cet incident, \u00e0 savoir, se pencher en avant en exposant l\u2019arri\u00e8re de son corps \u00e0 un coll\u00e8gue de sexe masculin avec qui elle avait une relation tendue, et au sujet de qui elle avait exprim\u00e9 un inconfort.\n[87] De plus, j\u2019estime que le fait que M. Dor\u00e9 n\u2019ait pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer ce qui se passait devant lui, et qu\u2019il ait refus\u00e9 de donner suite \u00e0 la demande d\u2019aide de Mme Young, a aggrav\u00e9 les effets de la situation et donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young l\u2019impression que son employeur \u00e9tait indiff\u00e9rent \u00e0 ses pr\u00e9occupations.\n[88] M\u00eame si elle ne l\u2019a fait que bri\u00e8vement au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Young a aussi parl\u00e9 d\u2019un autre incident o\u00f9 la proximit\u00e9 physique de M. Sawchuk lui avait caus\u00e9 une d\u00e9tresse semblable.\n[89] Mme Young a d\u00e9crit un incident au cours duquel, alors qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait en train de descendre une \u00e9chelle pour d\u00e9barquer du train, M. Sawchuk avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 grimper la m\u00eame \u00e9chelle, pour s\u2019arr\u00eater juste sous elle. Il ressort manifestement du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young qu\u2019elle se sentait expos\u00e9e et vuln\u00e9rable dans cette position.\n[90] Comme la question n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9e par aucun autre t\u00e9moin et qu\u2019elle a seulement \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9e au passage par Mme Young, j\u2019estime que, selon toute vraisemblance, cette interaction a eu lieu, mais j\u2019y accorderai peu de poids aux fins de mes motifs.\nCommentaires grossiers et d\u00e9nigrants\n[91] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet \u00e0 maintes reprises de commentaires grossiers et d\u00e9nigrants de la part de M. Sawchuk, soit en personne, soit sur la fr\u00e9quence radio. En particulier, elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019en d\u00e9cembre 2012, M. Sawchuk avait pass\u00e9 des commentaires au sujet de son utilisation des toilettes, en diffusant ces commentaires sur la fr\u00e9quence radio utilis\u00e9e par tous les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives qui \u00e9taient de service. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young au sujet de cet incident a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, dont M. Al Arsenault, et VIA ne l\u2019a pas contredit ou contest\u00e9 directement.\n[92] M. Arsenault, qui travaillait avec Mme Young \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait entendu cette communication sur la fr\u00e9quence radio. Lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait all\u00e9 chercher Mme Young \u00e0 l\u2019atelier o\u00f9 elle se trouvait au moment de l\u2019incident, il avait remarqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pleur\u00e9. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young ce qui s\u2019\u00e9tait pass\u00e9, elle lui avait r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle se sentait embarrass\u00e9e et mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise.\n[93] Au vu de la preuve dont je dispose, j\u2019estime que, selon toute vraisemblance, cet incident s\u2019est produit tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9, et je conclus qu\u2019il constitue un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de la Loi.\n[94] Mme Young a \u00e9galement affirm\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk lui avait parl\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re rabaissante et non professionnelle de la fa\u00e7on dont elle devait effectuer une man\u0153uvre de train. Malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le superviseur de Mme Young, M. Sawchuk, selon elle, lui avait parl\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re impolie et lui avait dit [traduction] : \u00ab Je vais te donner des directives \u00bb. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait vu dans ces agissements une tentative de M. Sawchuk d\u2019affirmer sa sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 et sa domination sur elle en insistant pour qu\u2019elle se conforme \u00e0 ses vues sur la mani\u00e8re d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les man\u0153uvres de train. Et ce, malgr\u00e9 le fait que, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a appris, il y a souvent plus d\u2019une fa\u00e7on correcte d\u2019accomplir une t\u00e2che en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans la gare de triage.\n[95] VIA n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk ait agi de fa\u00e7on impolie envers Mme Young, que ce soit lors de cet incident en particulier ou d\u2019une mani\u00e8re plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. De fait, Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Dor\u00e9 avait convenu avec elle, au moment de l\u2019incident, que le ton et la communication de M. Sawchuk \u00e9taient inappropri\u00e9s. Dans sa propre d\u00e9position, M. Dor\u00e9 a confirm\u00e9 les d\u00e9clarations de Mme Young sur ce point. En outre, lors de son contre-interrogatoire, M. Medeiros a confirm\u00e9 avoir dit \u00e0 Mme Young que le comportement de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait du [traduction] \u00ab harc\u00e8lement, absolument \u00bb. M. Medeiros a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 il \u00e9tait intervenu dans la situation entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk, il savait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait anxieuse en pr\u00e9sence de M. Sawchuk et qu\u2019\u00e0 n\u2019en pas douter, elle \u00e9tait boulevers\u00e9e et avait peur de lui.\n[96] Je conclus qu\u2019\u00e0 de multiples reprises, M. Sawchuk s\u2019est exprim\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on grossi\u00e8re et non professionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de Mme Young, tant en s\u2019adressant \u00e0 elle directement qu\u2019en sa pr\u00e9sence ou sur l\u2019appareil radio, et j\u2019estime que ce comportement constitue un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de la Loi.\nCritique de la voix de Mme Young sur l\u2019appareil radio (octobre 2012)\n[97] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young, M. Sawchuk se plaignait du fait qu\u2019elle ne parlait pas assez fort pour qu\u2019il l\u2019entende sur la fr\u00e9quence radio lorsqu\u2019ils travaillaient durant le m\u00eame quart de travail, mais ne travaillaient pas ensemble. Mme Young a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la critique de M. Sawchuk la visait, en tant que coll\u00e8gue f\u00e9minine, et \u00e9tait destin\u00e9e \u00e0 la rabaisser et \u00e0 la d\u00e9nigrer. Mme Young a fait remarquer que d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues n\u2019avaient aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entendre et \u00e0 la comprendre lorsqu\u2019elle s\u2019exprimait sur l\u2019\u00e9metteur radio, et que M. Sawchuk s\u2019en prenait \u00e0 elle en faisant r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 une caract\u00e9ristique li\u00e9e au sexe, \u00e0 savoir une voix f\u00e9minine (plus douce).\n[98] M. Sawchuk a admis s\u2019\u00eatre plaint \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et \u00e0 de nombreuses personnes de la voix de Mme Young sur la fr\u00e9quence radio. Il a affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il soulevait ainsi une pr\u00e9occupation valable quant au fait que Mme Young ne se conformait pas au protocole de communication radio. M. Sawchuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait aussi port\u00e9 plainte contre d\u2019autres pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives. M. Medeiros a confirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab pointilleux \u00bb en ce qui a trait au protocole radio.\n[99] Malgr\u00e9 les plaintes de M. Sawchuk au sujet de la voix de Mme Young, le Tribunal n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi d\u2019aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve qui indiquerait qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019un probl\u00e8me de rendement pour Mme Young, ou que sa conduite \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 ce que l\u2019on attendait d\u2019une personne occupant son poste. En l\u2019absence de tout \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve \u00e9tablissant que M. Sawchuk soulevait l\u00e0 un probl\u00e8me valide de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ou de rendement, je conclus que ses plaintes adress\u00e9es \u00e0 Mme Young et formul\u00e9es contre elle au sujet de sa voix constituent un traitement d\u00e9favorable selon la Loi.\n[100] Il convient de souligner, ici, que des remarques et des comportements pouvant para\u00eetre neutres \u00e0 une personne qui jouit du privil\u00e8ge associ\u00e9 \u00e0 la culture dominante dans un contexte particulier peuvent \u00eatre ressentis comme \u2014 et, en fait, constituer \u2014 de l\u2019exclusion, de la stigmatisation ou de la discrimination du point de vue d\u2019une personne qui ne jouit pas du m\u00eame privil\u00e8ge dans le m\u00eame contexte.\n[101] Par exemple, dans un milieu traditionnellement masculin, des commentaires concernant une caract\u00e9ristique li\u00e9e au sexe, comme le ton de voix d\u2019une femme ou le caract\u00e8re appropri\u00e9 de ses v\u00eatements, peuvent cr\u00e9er une exp\u00e9rience d\u2019\u00ab alt\u00e9rit\u00e9 \u00bb dont l\u2019effet est de diminuer ou de rabaisser une personne en fonction d\u2019une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Par exemple, des remarques sur les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents familiaux ou les caract\u00e9ristiques physiques (comme les cheveux) d\u2019une personne racis\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019elles sont faites dans un contexte o\u00f9 la plupart des gens ne partagent pas ces m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques, peuvent avoir des effets discriminatoires. De telles remarques sont de plus en plus consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme une forme de comportement discriminatoire que l\u2019on appelle microagressions.\n[102] La cons\u00e9quence des r\u00e9criminations de M. Sawchuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 de donner l\u2019impression que la fa\u00e7on dont Mme Young s\u2019exprimait \u00e0 la radio \u2014 une question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autrement soulev\u00e9e en tant que probl\u00e8me de rendement par d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues ou par des superviseurs \u2014 \u00e9tait mauvaise ou incorrecte. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir eu le sentiment que ces agissements \u00e9taient dirig\u00e9s contre elle, et qu\u2019ils faisaient partie de la conduite de M. Sawchuk consistant \u00e0 affirmer son contr\u00f4le et sa domination sur elle au travail. J\u2019arrive en outre \u00e0 la conclusion que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est plaint de Mme Young au superviseur de celle-ci et, de son propre aveu, \u00e0 d\u2019autres coll\u00e8gues, au sujet de la m\u00eame question. Bien que je ne sois pas en mesure d\u2019\u00e9valuer s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une pr\u00e9occupation valable du point de vue des protocoles radio et des r\u00e8gles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 en milieu de travail, je conclus que les agissements en cause \u00e9taient, \u00e0 tout le moins, non professionnels. Somme toute, au regard de la relation globale et du comportement d\u00e9crits dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je conclus que les commentaires et les plaintes de M. Sawchuk au sujet de la voix de Mme Young sur la fr\u00e9quence radio constituaient un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de la Loi.\nAbsence de r\u00e9ponse aux communications et insistance quant \u00e0 une communication par \u00e9metteur radio (d\u00e9cembre 2012)\n[103] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage que, vers la fin de 2012, au bout d\u2019une p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e8s de douze mois qui, selon elle, \u00e9tait caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par un comportement non professionnel et d\u00e9nigrant de la part de M. Sawchuk et une intervention minimale de la part de VIA, la situation entre M. Sawchuk et Mme Young s\u2019\u00e9tait consid\u00e9rablement d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e. Mme Young a dit qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, alors qu\u2019elle et M. Sawchuk travaillaient en partenariat pendant un quart de travail, il insistait pour diffuser toutes les communications entre eux sur la fr\u00e9quence radio commune utilis\u00e9e par tous leurs coll\u00e8gues de l\u2019\u00e9quipe, en d\u00e9pit du fait qu\u2019ils se trouvaient souvent \u00e0 quelques pieds l\u2019un de l\u2019autre et parfaitement \u00e0 port\u00e9e de voix. Aux dires de Mme Young, il avait \u00e9galement exig\u00e9 qu\u2019elle fasse de m\u00eame. Cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredite par aucun t\u00e9moin, et je crois comprendre qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 d\u2019une pratique normale chez des coll\u00e8gues qui travaillent ensemble.\n[104] La situation a atteint son paroxysme le 7 d\u00e9cembre 2012 lorsque, selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young, M. Sawchuk faisait mine de ne pas l\u2019entendre alors qu\u2019elle lui parlait dans la cabine du train. Mme Young a r\u00e9agi en activant l\u2019arr\u00eat d\u2019urgence, ce qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s ce que j\u2019ai compris des divers t\u00e9moignages livr\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience au sujet de l\u2019incident, constitue une r\u00e9action s\u00e9rieuse \u00e0 une menace pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 per\u00e7ue dans la gare de triage.\n[105] M. Sawchuk a ripost\u00e9 aux actions de Mme Young en sortant de la cabine et en claquant la porte derri\u00e8re lui.\n[106] Je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019insistance de M. Sawchuk pour que sa coll\u00e8gue communique exclusivement par radio avec lui est m\u00e9prisante et contr\u00f4lante. Bien que j\u2019aie entendu un t\u00e9moignage selon lequel cette fa\u00e7on de faire entrait dans les param\u00e8tres des r\u00e8gles de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et des protocoles radio, je ne suis pas convaincue que, sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, une raison valable justifiait que M. Sawchuk impose \u00e0 Mme Young de communiquer avec lui par radio seulement. Je suis d\u2019avis que M. Sawchuk entendait ainsi contr\u00f4ler et embarrasser Mme Young, de m\u00eame qu\u2019affirmer sa domination et son sentiment de sup\u00e9riorit\u00e9 sur elle en agissant d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9e par les r\u00e8gles, mais qui la faisait sentir inapte \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ses exigences. Je conclus que ce comportement constitue un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de la Loi.\n[107] Mme Young avait signal\u00e9 l\u2019incident \u00e0 son superviseur, M. Dor\u00e9, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au Tribunal avoir \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la conduite de M. Sawchuk. M. Dor\u00e9 a parl\u00e9 de la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la dynamique de travail comme d\u2019un danger pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il avait fait part de ses inqui\u00e9tudes au sujet du comportement de M. Sawchuk (en ce qui concerne cet incident et de fa\u00e7on plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rale) \u00e0 la haute direction, y compris \u00e0 M. Medeiros et \u00e0 M. Hamilton, dans un courriel dat\u00e9 du 8 d\u00e9cembre 2012.\n[108] Dans son courriel, M. Dor\u00e9 se disait tr\u00e8s inquiet de la conduite de M. Sawchuk, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits par Mme Young. Il y sonnait l\u2019alarme au sujet des interactions de M. Sawchuk avec un certain nombre d\u2019employ\u00e9s, et demandait : [traduction] \u00ab Il y en a combien d\u2019autres? Et combien de plus allons-nous tol\u00e9rer? \u00bb\n[109] M. Medeiros, qui avait re\u00e7u la note de service de M. Dor\u00e9, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab tout cela n\u2019\u00e9tait que des ou\u00ef-dire \u00bb, en ajoutant qu\u2019il avait alors conclu \u00e0 l\u2019absence d\u2019une plainte \u00e9crite officielle concernant M. Sawchuk (m\u00eame s\u2019il a admis avoir re\u00e7u le courriel d\u2019un de ses gestionnaires qui se disait alarm\u00e9 par la conduite de M. Sawchuk et qui qualifiait la situation de dangereuse). \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, tout comme dans le cadre de l\u2019audience, VIA a minimis\u00e9 la gravit\u00e9 des agissements de M. Sawchuk et des pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Young, en affirmant que celle-ci r\u00e9agissait de fa\u00e7on excessive aux pr\u00e9judices qu\u2019elle subissait. La direction de VIA, de surcro\u00eet, avait fix\u00e9 son attention sur la question de l\u2019existence de plaintes \u00e9crites officielles, sans se soucier suffisamment de la d\u00e9gradation rapide et potentiellement dangereuse de la situation entre M. Sawchuk et Mme Young.\n[110] Je suis d\u2019avis que, d\u00e8s d\u00e9cembre 2012, la direction de VIA disposait d\u2019amplement de preuves que la situation entre M. Sawchuk et Mme Young \u00e9tait dysfonctionnelle et risqu\u00e9e (surtout dans un milieu de travail o\u00f9 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 est un enjeu).\n[111] Presque tous les t\u00e9moins qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal au sujet du comportement de M. Sawchuk ont d\u00e9crit ce dernier en des termes peu flatteurs. Et VIA n\u2019a fait aucun effort pour contester l\u2019argument de Mme Young selon lequel M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait impoli, contr\u00f4lant et non professionnel.\n[112] Le fait que VIA minimise la d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration de la situation, y compris les pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es dans le courriel de M. Dor\u00e9 datant de d\u00e9cembre 2012, a eu pour effet que la situation d\u00e9rape de plus en plus. \u00c0 ce stade, il aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e9vident pour VIA que M. Sawchuk et Mme Young ne pouvaient pas travailler ensemble en toute s\u00e9curit\u00e9, compte tenu surtout de la nature de leurs fonctions.\nObservation par M. Sawchuk du vestiaire des femmes\n[113] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait fr\u00e9quemment pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du vestiaire des femmes, dans l\u2019aire de repos o\u00f9 se trouvent des fauteuils, lorsqu\u2019elle arrivait pour le d\u00e9but de son quart de travail. Son t\u00e9moignage sur ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par M. Kalelopoulos et admis par M. Sawchuk.\n[114] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9occup\u00e9e de ce que M. Sawchuk la regarde arriver au travail et prenne des photos d\u2019elle dans le vestiaire. \u00c0 mon avis, il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une r\u00e9elle source de pr\u00e9occupation pour Mme Young, qui avait sinc\u00e8rement l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre observ\u00e9e par M. Sawchuk lorsqu\u2019elle arrivait sur les lieux et se pr\u00e9parait pour le travail. Compte tenu de la relation de plus en plus tendue et d\u00e9t\u00e9rior\u00e9e entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk, je comprends pourquoi Mme Young a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[115] M. Sawchuk a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019ils prennent une pause de leur travail dans la gare de triage, lui et des coll\u00e8gues s\u2019assoient r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans l\u2019aire de repos appel\u00e9e \u00ab the leathers \u00bb [\u00ab les cuirs \u00bb], et qu\u2019il s\u2019y assoit aussi seul \u00e0 l\u2019occasion. Il a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019observait pas Mme Young dans le vestiaire et ne la photographiait pas pendant qu\u2019elle se pr\u00e9parait pour son quart de travail.\n[116] D\u2019apr\u00e8s les images du vestiaire qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je conclus que l\u2019entr\u00e9e de celui-ci est visible depuis l\u2019aire de repos. Cependant, je ne dispose pas de suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour conclure qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019apercevoir l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du vestiaire \u00e0 partir des fauteuils qui s\u2019y trouvent. La preuve produite \u00e0 l\u2019audience ne permet pas de confirmer que M. Sawchuk prenait des photos de Mme Young dans le vestiaire, m\u00eame si celle-ci redoutait sinc\u00e8rement que ce f\u00fbt le cas.\n[117] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, y compris le propre t\u00e9moignage de M. Sawchuk, et du fait que M. Medeiros a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 au sujet de M. Sawchuk qu\u2019il avait l\u2019habitude d\u2019observer et de commenter les faits et gestes de ses coll\u00e8gues en milieu de travail, je conclus que, selon toute vraisemblance, M. Sawchuk a observ\u00e9 les all\u00e9es et venues de Mme Young au travail d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui n\u2019\u00e9tait pas requise dans le cadre de son emploi.\n[118] Bien que ce fait, \u00e0 lui seul, ne soit pas d\u00e9terminant, il s\u2019inscrit dans une conduite et a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une atmosph\u00e8re dans laquelle Mme Young se sentait surveill\u00e9e par M. Sawchuk. Je conclus que M. Sawchuk surveillait effectivement Mme Young, et qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait l\u00e0 d\u2019une conduite pr\u00e9judiciable dirig\u00e9e contre elle.\nDiff\u00e9rend concernant le fait de travailler avec la porte de la cabine ouverte et remarques sur la tenue vestimentaire de Mme Young (f\u00e9vrier 2013)\n[119] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en f\u00e9vrier 2013, par une froide journ\u00e9e d\u2019hiver, alors qu\u2019elle et M. Sawchuk travaillaient ensemble dans la cabine d\u2019une locomotive, M. Sawchuk, qui se trouvait pr\u00e8s de la porte de la cabine, avait insist\u00e9 pour la garder ouverte pendant un certain nombre d\u2019heures durant son quart de travail. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cette situation la mettait tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise, et que M. Sawchuk n\u2019\u00e9tait pas dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 acc\u00e9der \u00e0 sa demande de fermer la porte.\n[120] Lorsque Mme Young avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 son superviseur, M. Hamilton, de l\u2019aider \u00e0 g\u00e9rer la situation avec M. Sawchuk, M. Hamilton avait parl\u00e9 \u00e0 celui-ci. Selon la preuve dont dispose le Tribunal, M. Sawchuk a r\u00e9agi \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Young en disant \u00e0 M. Hamilton qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab devrait penser \u00e0 s\u2019habiller en fonction de la m\u00e9t\u00e9o \u00bb, ce qui laissait entendre que la demande de Mme Young de fermer la porte l\u2019hiver \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable ou que cette derni\u00e8re ne comprenait pas comment s\u2019habiller pour son travail.\n[121] M. Hamilton a tranch\u00e9 que, pour chaque quart de travail ou man\u0153uvre, il revenait \u00e0 l\u2019employ\u00e9 affect\u00e9 au poste de conducteur de d\u00e9cider si la porte de la cabine devait rester ouverte ou ferm\u00e9e. Le membre d\u2019\u00e9quipe devait suivre les instructions du conducteur.\n[122] Puis, un autre diff\u00e9rend est survenu en mars 2013. Mme Young avait \u00e9t\u00e9 affect\u00e9e comme conductrice pendant le quart de travail, et M. Sawchuk prenait place dans la cabine. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk avait refus\u00e9 de fermer la porte de la cabine, malgr\u00e9 sa demande en ce sens et la directive de M. Hamilton selon laquelle le conducteur avait le droit de d\u00e9cider si la porte resterait ouverte ou ferm\u00e9e.\n[123] Les faits entourant ces deux incidents n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s devant moi. Cependant, les versions des t\u00e9moins divergeaient consid\u00e9rablement.\n[124] Mme Young s\u2019est plainte de ce que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait m\u00e9prisante, et ses commentaires au sujet de sa tenue au travail, d\u00e9nigrants et sexistes.\n[125] VIA a fait valoir que le conflit entre les deux coll\u00e8gues \u00e9tait un simple d\u00e9saccord li\u00e9 \u00e0 une question de confort et \u00e0 la temp\u00e9rature qui devrait r\u00e9gner dans leur lieu de travail.\n[126] Bien que cette caract\u00e9risation par VIA soit plausible dans le cas du premier incident \u2014 quoique peu probable vu le contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la relation entre M. Sawchuk et Mme Young \u2014, la r\u00e9surgence du diff\u00e9rend quelques semaines plus tard, malgr\u00e9 les directives de leur gestionnaire, est r\u00e9v\u00e9latrice des v\u00e9ritables intentions de M. Sawchuk. Le fait d\u2019insister, malgr\u00e9 les objections d\u2019une coll\u00e8gue, pour garder la porte ouverte par une froide nuit d\u2019hiver ne repr\u00e9sente pas qu\u2019un simple d\u00e9saccord raisonnable entre coll\u00e8gues au sujet de la temp\u00e9rature du lieu de travail, encore moins lorsqu\u2019il se produit \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition malgr\u00e9 des directives claires d\u2019un superviseur. Je conclus donc, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est conduit ainsi pour tenter d\u2019affirmer son contr\u00f4le et sa domination sur Mme Young et de profiter de l\u2019occasion pour l\u2019emb\u00eater et la mettre mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise, ce qui \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de la Loi.\n[127] Je trouve \u00e9galement d\u00e9nigrant et condescendant le commentaire de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 son superviseur selon lequel Mme Young devrait s\u2019habiller en fonction de la m\u00e9t\u00e9o.\n[128] Je ne saurais convenir que les propos de M. Sawchuk sur les v\u00eatements de Mme Young \u00e9taient \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexuel ou constituaient du harc\u00e8lement sexuel. Toutefois, comme je l\u2019explique ailleurs dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, des remarques qui visent \u00e0 diminuer ou \u00e0 exclure une personne n\u2019en peuvent pas moins constituer de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, surtout lorsqu\u2019elles font partie d\u2019une conduite visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une domination et un contr\u00f4le sur la personne et qu\u2019ils sont li\u00e9s \u00e0 une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\nD\u00e9nigrement de Mme Young concernant le d\u00e9placement d\u2019un train\n[129] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, la nuit m\u00eame o\u00f9 s\u2019\u00e9tait produit le deuxi\u00e8me incident avec la porte de la cabine, au d\u00e9but de mars 2013, M. Sawchuk (la personne au sol) lui avait demand\u00e9 (en tant que conductrice) d\u2019effectuer le d\u00e9placement du train, en lan\u00e7ant : [traduction] \u00ab 203, allez-y \u00bb, ce qui signifiait que le train 203 devait avancer. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait alors proc\u00e9d\u00e9 au d\u00e9placement comme demand\u00e9. Or, M. Sawchuk l\u2019avait ensuite r\u00e9primand\u00e9e \u00e0 plusieurs reprises sur la fr\u00e9quence radio pour avoir effectu\u00e9 la man\u0153uvre, tout en niant lui avoir lui-m\u00eame demand\u00e9 de l\u2019ex\u00e9cuter.\n[130] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e9tait clair et pr\u00e9cis. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que cet incident \u00e9tait extr\u00eamement pr\u00e9occupant \u00e0 ses yeux, car il aurait pu entra\u00eener de lourdes cons\u00e9quences pour elle si quelque chose \u00e9tait arriv\u00e9 au train, \u00e0 tout autre v\u00e9hicule ou \u00e0 une personne dans la gare de triage. Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young sur cette question n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 contredit par aucun autre t\u00e9moin. Interrog\u00e9 au sujet de l\u2019incident, M. Sawchuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se souvenait pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment des faits en question.\n[131] Tout bien pes\u00e9, j\u2019estime que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young \u00e0 ce sujet est fiable. Elle a relat\u00e9 les faits tels qu\u2019elle s\u2019en souvenait clairement, et les gestes qu\u2019elle a pos\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident corroborent son t\u00e9moignage selon lequel elle redoutait les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019ordre professionnel et s\u00e9curitaire susceptibles de d\u00e9couler d\u2019un tel incident, advenant qu\u2019il se reproduise. De plus, sa d\u00e9position concordait avec les faits rapport\u00e9s dans sa plainte pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en milieu de travail, son entrevue avec Mme Selesnic et la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que M. Sawchuk a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young la directive de d\u00e9placer le train, pour ensuite la r\u00e9primander sur la fr\u00e9quence radio, ce qui constitue un traitement d\u00e9favorable vis\u00e9 par la Loi.\n[132] Lorsque Mme Young est all\u00e9e voir M. Hamilton pour lui dire qu\u2019elle ne voulait plus travailler avec M. Sawchuk, le superviseur lui a demand\u00e9 de communiquer son refus de travailler par \u00e9crit. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, Mme Young a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de VIA neuf lettres de plainte o\u00f9 elle d\u00e9crivait en d\u00e9tail les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits entre avril 2012 et mars 2013. Ces lettres indiquent clairement que la situation entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk avait atteint un point o\u00f9 Mme Young craignait les r\u00e9percussions de la conduite de M. Sawchuk sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ainsi que les dysfonctions qui en r\u00e9sultaient en milieu de travail.\n[133] \u00c0 ce stade, M. Medeiros avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019occuper plus directement de la situation, et lui et Mme Young ont tous deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019ils consid\u00e9raient alors que l\u2019affaire engageait l\u2019application de la politique de VIA sur le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail. En mars et en avril 2013, une s\u00e9rie de mesures ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place, y compris une enqu\u00eate officielle en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail men\u00e9e par Mme Selesnic, une autre gestionnaire de VIA.\n[134] L\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par Mme Selesnic sera examin\u00e9e plus en d\u00e9tail ci-dessous. Toutefois, il importe de noter ici qu\u2019\u00e0 la suite d\u2019une enqu\u00eate interne r\u00e9alis\u00e9e en milieu de travail (qui \u00e9tait en fait une s\u00e9rie d\u2019entrevues d\u00e9taill\u00e9es), Mme Selesnic a fourni une sorte de rapport verbal de ses conclusions \u00e0 M. Medeiros et \u00e0 M. Hamilton. Il ne semble pas qu\u2019un rapport \u00e9crit ait \u00e9t\u00e9 produit et, de toute fa\u00e7on, aucun n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis en preuve au Tribunal. M\u00eame si, \u00e0 l\u2019origine, l\u2019enqu\u00eate avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme portant sur une plainte de harc\u00e8lement, \u00e0 un certain moment au cours du processus, VIA l\u2019a rebaptis\u00e9e en tant qu\u2019enqu\u00eate sur une [traduction] \u00ab conduite inconvenante \u00bb.\n[135] Au bout du compte, apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate, la direction de VIA a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que le comportement de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young contrevenait au Code de conduite et n\u00e9cessitait une sanction disciplinaire s\u00e9v\u00e8re.\n[136] Selon la preuve de VIA, les mesures disciplinaires inflig\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Sawchuk \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sont les suivantes :\na) l\u2019attribution de 25 points d\u2019inaptitude;\nb) la consigne d\u2019\u00e9viter tout contact avec Mme Young.\n[137] Le Tribunal n\u2019est pas li\u00e9 par les conclusions d\u2019une enqu\u00eate interne en milieu de travail. Cela dit, le fait que VIA ait elle-m\u00eame d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 de graves agissements transgressant le Code de conduite vient conforter la conclusion du Tribunal selon laquelle M. Sawchuk a adopt\u00e9 une conduite d\u00e9favorable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young, tant en regard des politiques de VIA applicables au milieu de travail \u2014 comme il est expliqu\u00e9 dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs \u2014 que sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi.\nContact physique au poste de ravitaillement (septembre 2013)\n[138] Dans sa plainte et \u00e0 l\u2019audience, Mme Young a consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 traiter de la question de savoir si, en septembre 2013, M. Sawchuk avait eu un contact physique avec elle au poste de ravitaillement, lors d\u2019un quart de travail o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient tous deux de service.\n[139] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait entr\u00e9 dans le poste de ravitaillement alors qu\u2019elle et son partenaire s\u2019y trouvaient d\u00e9j\u00e0, et qu\u2019il avait entrepris de traverser devant elle pendant qu\u2019elle assurait l\u2019entretien de sa locomotive. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019alors qu\u2019elle s\u2019affairait \u00e0 l\u2019avant du train, M. Sawchuk avait \u00e9tabli un contact physique avec elle au moment de la d\u00e9passer.\n[140] M. Sawchuk a ni\u00e9 avoir touch\u00e9 Mme Young.\n[141] En prenant connaissance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs \u00e0 cette all\u00e9gation, j\u2019ai eu la possibilit\u00e9 de regarder des enregistrements vid\u00e9o et un certain nombre de photos. Par suite de cet examen, et compte tenu des t\u00e9moignages respectifs de Mme Young et de M. Sawchuk, je conclus que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est donn\u00e9 du mal pour traverser la voie ferr\u00e9e tout pr\u00e8s de Mme Young, mais que rien ne me permet de conclure \u00e0 un contact physique avec elle.\n[142] Cette conclusion ne veut pas dire que j\u2019estime que Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 malhonn\u00eate dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 propos de l\u2019incident. Au vu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, et du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young en particulier, je ne doute pas que celle-ci soit convaincue de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de son t\u00e9moignage, m\u00eame si la preuve ne me permet pas de conclure qu\u2019il y a eu un contact physique.\n[143] En septembre 2013, la perception qu\u2019avait Mme Young des faits et du comportement de M. Sawchuk pourrait avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9e par la crainte et le traumatisme qu\u2019a laiss\u00e9s chez elle la conduite abusive longtemps subie de la part de M. Sawchuk. Si une telle possibilit\u00e9 est pertinente quant au poids que je puis accorder au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young, ce t\u00e9moignage ne s\u2019en trouve pas pour autant affaibli, d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9, dans de nombreux cas, corrobor\u00e9 par celui d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins.\n[144] M\u00eame si je ne suis pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 faire primer la perception qu\u2019a Mme Young de l\u2019incident en question sur mon propre examen des photographies ou des enregistrements vid\u00e9o produits en preuve, je constate que la conduite adopt\u00e9e par M. Sawchuk au poste de ravitaillement ce soir-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019avertissement qu\u2019il avait re\u00e7u \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate en milieu de travail, et selon lequel il devait \u00e9viter Mme Young. \u00c0 mon avis, il ne fait aucun doute que M. Sawchuk a orient\u00e9 sa trajectoire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 passer extr\u00eamement pr\u00e8s de Mme Young, alors qu\u2019il aurait facilement pu choisir d\u2019emprunter un autre chemin pour laisser plus d\u2019espace \u00e0 celle-ci.\n[145] M\u00eame en l\u2019absence d\u2019un contact physique avec Mme Young, je constate que M. Sawchuk a fait fi des instructions qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9es d\u2019\u00e9viter Mme Young, alors qu\u2019il savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir qu\u2019agir ainsi la mettrait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise. J\u2019estime que ce comportement cadre avec la conduite qui ressort \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence des pr\u00e9sents motifs, \u00e0 savoir que M. Sawchuk tentait d\u2019affirmer son contr\u00f4le ou sa domination sur Mme Young \u2014 souvent dans une relative impunit\u00e9 \u2014 et je conclus qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable au sens de la Loi.\n1)Conduite de M. Sawchuk en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n[146] En plus d\u2019analyser individuellement les incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer les effets des agissements d\u2019une personne sur un plaignant, il est souvent important de prendre du recul et d\u2019examiner la conduite en cause dans son ensemble. Dans de nombreux cas, y compris celui qui nous occupe, le tout est effectivement bien plus grand que la somme de ses parties.\n[147] Bien que, pris isol\u00e9ment, de nombreux incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte de Mme Young puissent sembler anodins, l\u2019effet cumulatif de la conduite adopt\u00e9e M. Sawchuk pendant pr\u00e8s de deux ans r\u00e9v\u00e8le un comportement d\u00e9nigrant, qui visait vraisemblablement \u00e0 imposer un contr\u00f4le et qui a certainement eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable pour Mme Young.\n[148] Le Tribunal a entendu pendant des semaines les t\u00e9moignages de seize t\u00e9moins, dont presque tous, y compris M. Sawchuk lui-m\u00eame, ont affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait difficile de travailler avec lui. Ces t\u00e9moignages ont compos\u00e9 un portrait tout \u00e0 fait clair, et en grande partie coh\u00e9rent, de M. Sawchuk en tant que pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux locomotives fort comp\u00e9tent, qui poss\u00e8de beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience et de connaissances au sujet du travail ferroviaire, mais avec qui de nombreux coll\u00e8gues et superviseurs trouvaient difficile de travailler au quotidien.\n[149] Les t\u00e9moins ont utilis\u00e9 au sujet de M. Sawchuk des termes comme [traduction] \u00ab intimidation \u00bb, [traduction] \u00ab contr\u00f4le \u00bb et [traduction] \u00ab gros probl\u00e8me \u00bb pour d\u00e9crire un comportement que le Tribunal qualifierait d\u2019abusif et de toxique, et qui comprend notamment le fait de crier contre les employ\u00e9s et de recourir \u00e0 un langage vulgaire ou \u00e0 des jurons. Certains t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit M. Sawchuk comme quelqu\u2019un qui surveille ses pairs en milieu de travail et qui pr\u00e9tend corriger leurs \u00e9carts de rendement, ou encore qui signale aux superviseurs de quart les rendements qu\u2019il juge inappropri\u00e9s. M. Medeiros, pour sa part, a dit de M. Sawchuk qu\u2019il est une personne toujours d\u00e9sireuse d\u2019avoir raison, qui croit \u00eatre la meilleure au travail et qui est toujours convaincue que sa fa\u00e7on de faire est la meilleure.\n[150] J\u2019ai entendu de nombreux t\u00e9moins dire que Mme Young ne s\u2019en remettait pas \u00e0 M. Sawchuk pour savoir comment exercer ses fonctions de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux locomotives. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins ont confirm\u00e9 que de nombreuses t\u00e2ches pouvaient \u00eatre accomplies correctement de diverses mani\u00e8res, et que les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives pouvaient les ex\u00e9cuter avec succ\u00e8s sans n\u00e9cessairement suivre l\u2019approche retenue par M. Sawchuk. Cependant, pour certains employ\u00e9s, en particulier ceux que M. Sawchuk consid\u00e9rait comme inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 lui sur le plan des comp\u00e9tences et de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience, le fait de ne pas se plier \u00e0 l\u2019approche privil\u00e9gi\u00e9e par celui-ci revenait \u00e0 \u00eatre la cible de ses critiques, de son intimidation et de son contr\u00f4le.\n[151] M. Medeiros a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk agissait de la sorte avec les employ\u00e9s les plus r\u00e9cemment arriv\u00e9s, dont un certain nombre de femmes, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019essayait pas de contr\u00f4ler ainsi le comportement au travail des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives plus exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s, avec qui il travaillait depuis longtemps, et qui \u00e9taient tous des hommes.\n[152] J\u2019estime, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, que M. Sawchuk avait du m\u00e9pris pour la fa\u00e7on dont Mme Young abordait son travail de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux locomotives, et qu\u2019il ne la respectait pas comme coll\u00e8gue. Mme Young ne s\u2019est pas pli\u00e9e aux tentatives de M. Sawchuk de la former \u00e0 sa m\u00e9thode de travail, ce qui lui a valu les foudres de ce dernier. Elle a donc fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une campagne de harc\u00e8lement et d\u2019abus qui, examin\u00e9e globalement, constitue un grave traitement d\u00e9favorable. Via aurait d\u00fb reconna\u00eetre celui-ci et y rem\u00e9dier.\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la question du traitement d\u00e9favorable\n[153] Il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal de se prononcer sur une conduite qui d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. En outre, le Tribunal ne pr\u00e9tend pas d\u00e9tenir une expertise particuli\u00e8re dans des domaines autres que ceux vis\u00e9s par la Loi. Toutefois, compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal et de la nature d\u00e9licate, sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, du travail des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives au CMT, la plainte de Mme Young illustre le danger qui guette un milieu de travail qui ne parvient pas \u00e0 rep\u00e9rer et \u00e0 \u00e9liminer les comportements toxiques et abusifs au travail.\n[154] Compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble de la preuve \u2014 notamment les conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par VIA en milieu de travail, le t\u00e9moignage de nombreux t\u00e9moins, dont le propre t\u00e9moin de VIA, M. Medeiros, et les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve \u2014, je conclus que M. Sawchuk a adopt\u00e9 une conduite d\u00e9nigrante et rabaissante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young, et ce, de janvier 2012 \u00e0 la fin de 2013, alors que M. Sawchuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9quipe de nuit et qu\u2019ils ont cess\u00e9 de travailler ensemble.\n[155] J\u2019estime que, prise dans son ensemble, la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young constitue un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable au sens de la Loi. Tout bien consid\u00e9r\u00e9, cette conduite atteint le seuil n\u00e9cessaire pour satisfaire \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore.\niii. La caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable [156] Ayant tranch\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une conduite pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young, le Tribunal entreprendra maintenant l\u2019analyse qui consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si le sexe de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle a subi. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est juste de dire qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 la nature discriminatoire de la conduite est flagrante. Pour reprendre l\u2019expression consacr\u00e9e par la jurisprudence du Tribunal, il s\u2019agit d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 la d\u00e9tection de [traduction] \u00ab subtiles odeurs de discrimination \u00bb exige d\u2019analyser soigneusement les faits pris dans leur contexte global (Basi).\n[157] Il ne faut donc pas s\u2019\u00e9tonner que cet aspect de la plainte soit celui qui fasse le plus d\u00e9bat entre les parties. Je commencerai par r\u00e9sumer la position des parties sur la question d\u2019un lien entre le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment expos\u00e9 et le sexe de Mme Young, puis j\u2019exposerai les raisons pour lesquelles je suis arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que le sexe de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans ce traitement pr\u00e9judiciable.\nPosition de la plaignante\n[158] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail ci-dessus, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Sawchuk a tent\u00e9 d\u2019affirmer sa domination et d\u2019imposer aux pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives une m\u00e9thode de travail particuli\u00e8re correspondant \u00e0 son approche de pr\u00e9dilection. Cette conduite visait principalement les employ\u00e9s \u00ab moins exp\u00e9riment\u00e9s \u00bb qui ne s\u2019en remettaient pas \u00e0 son point de vue sur la fa\u00e7on d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter le travail. Mme Young faisait partie de ces employ\u00e9s.\n[159] Mme Young a mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises que son genre ou son sexe avait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans le comportement qu\u2019elle avait subi de la part de M. Sawchuk. Tout au long de l\u2019audience, et dans ses observations, elle a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 quatre fa\u00e7ons dont son identit\u00e9 de femme a jou\u00e9 dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9 :\n1) M. Sawchuk r\u00e9agissait plus agressivement aux femmes r\u00e9sistant \u00e0 ses tentatives de contr\u00f4le qu\u2019aux hommes, qu\u2019il n\u2019osait pas d\u00e9fier;\n2) M. Sawchuk est \u00e0 l\u2019origine de plusieurs incidents particuliers o\u00f9 le sexe a constitu\u00e9 un facteur direct dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable lui-m\u00eame, notamment lorsqu\u2019il : a refus\u00e9 de s\u2019\u00e9loigner de l\u2019arri\u00e8re de Mme Young quand elle avait d\u00fb se pencher; a grimp\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9chelle o\u00f9 elle se trouvait de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 se retrouver juste devant l\u2019arri\u00e8re de son corps; s\u2019est plaint \u00e0 la direction de la voix de Mme Young \u00e0 la radio; a pass\u00e9 des commentaires condescendants sur le fait que Mme Young n\u2019\u00e9tait pas v\u00eatue correctement pour faire son travail;\n3) En tant que femme travaillant la nuit dans une vaste gare de triage souvent mal \u00e9clair\u00e9e, Mme Young, en raison de la conduite de M. Sawchuk, a ressenti de la peur et de l\u2019intimidation, une exp\u00e9rience qui \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 son identit\u00e9 de femme;\n4) Le d\u00e9faut de VIA de reconna\u00eetre le caract\u00e8re discriminatoire de la situation entre elle et M. Sawchuk et d\u2019y rem\u00e9dier a fait en sorte que les gestionnaires de VIA, principalement des hommes, aient exclu et diminu\u00e9 Mme Young pendant trop longtemps.\nPosition de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[160] Selon la position de VIA, M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait un coll\u00e8gue difficile qui avait des agissements non professionnels, mais sa conduite envers Mme Young n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec son identit\u00e9 de femme. Bien que M. Sawchuk ait pu avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 impoli ou irrespectueux, ou s\u2019\u00eatre livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab conduite inconvenante \u00bb, comme l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur le lieu de travail l\u2019a \u00e9tabli, le comportement de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait selon elle le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019un conflit entre deux groupes d\u2019employ\u00e9s. VIA a soutenu, dans ses observations finales, qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab une personne raisonnable n\u2019interpr\u00e9terait pas ce comportement comme \u00e9tant un traitement d\u00e9favorable ou du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe ou le genre \u00bb.\n[161] VIA a soutenu que l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 de Mme Young \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Sawchuk avait fauss\u00e9 sa perception des relations positives que M. Sawchuk entretenait avec d\u2019autres femmes au travail.\n[162] VIA a \u00e9galement fait valoir que Mme Young avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations vagues et non \u00e9tay\u00e9es sur les relations de travail ant\u00e9rieures de M. Sawchuk avec des coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin, et que le Tribunal devrait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rer le propre t\u00e9moignage de M. Sawchuk sur ses attitudes et de son comportement envers les femmes aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9manant de Mme Young et de leurs coll\u00e8gues ayant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[163] Dans ses observations finales, VIA a \u00e9galement attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur des passages des d\u00e9clarations de plusieurs autres t\u00e9moins (dont Kirk Porter, Michelle Pitt et M. Arsenault) pour appuyer sa position selon laquelle M. Sawchuk avait une bonne relation de travail avec certaines femmes.\n[164] Enfin, VIA a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de rejeter les t\u00e9moignages de MM. Arsenault, Micallef, Anroop et Cormier, qui ont tous d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk avait des difficult\u00e9s avec les femmes, en particulier avec celles qui ne se conformaient pas \u00e0 ses vues sur la mani\u00e8re d\u2019exercer les fonctions de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux locomotives. Chacun de ces t\u00e9moins s\u2019est express\u00e9ment dit d\u2019avis que le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young par M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait en partie d\u00fb au fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une femme.\niii. Position de la Commission\n[165] La Commission a fait valoir que la principale question que doit trancher le Tribunal dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte est celle de savoir si, au sens de la LCDP, le comportement de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young constitue du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le motif de distinction illicite qu\u2019est le sexe. Dans ses observations finales, la Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab La question qui se pose est celle de savoir si son comportement, dans ces circonstances, avait quoi que ce soit \u00e0 voir avec le sexe de Mme Young \u00bb.\n[166] Dans ses observations, la Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que la preuve \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard est, du moins en partie, contradictoire, et que la r\u00e9ponse du Tribunal \u00e0 la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente question repose sur une \u00e9valuation de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins ayant comparu devant le Tribunal.\n[167] La Commission a relev\u00e9, d\u2019une part, que Mme Selesnic et M. Medeiros avaient tous deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 ne pas croire que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au sexe de Mme Young, et que selon Mme Selesnic, au d\u00e9but de l\u2019enqu\u00eate en milieu de travail, Mme Young avait mis l\u2019accent sur la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail et non sur le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe.\n[168] La Commission a aussi relev\u00e9, d\u2019autre part, que selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young, M. Sawchuk traitait les femmes diff\u00e9remment des hommes, et lorsqu\u2019elle contestait la fa\u00e7on dont elle devait selon lui accomplir son travail de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9e aux locomotives, il ne lui r\u00e9pondait pas de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re qu\u2019il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin quand ceux-ci refusaient de retenir sa m\u00e9thode de travail.\n[169] La Commission a observ\u00e9 que M. Arsenault avait corrobor\u00e9 le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young en confirmant que M. Sawchuk traitait les femmes diff\u00e9remment. M. Arsenault avait aussi dit que M. Sawchuk aimait contr\u00f4ler la fa\u00e7on dont les gens travaillaient et qu\u2019il confrontait ses coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles se plient \u00e0 sa m\u00e9thode de travail de pr\u00e9dilection. La Commission a \u00e9galement relev\u00e9 le comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement contr\u00f4lant de M. Sawchuk et le fait qu\u2019un certain nombre de t\u00e9moins l\u2019avaient qualifi\u00e9 de maniaque du contr\u00f4le.\nAnalyse du lien entre la conduite de M. Sawchuk et le sexe de Mme Young\n[170] Le Tribunal rappelle que, souvent, la discrimination n\u2019est pas exerc\u00e9e ouvertement ni intentionnellement. Toutefois, pour donner leur sens aux protections pr\u00e9vues par la Loi, le Tribunal est charg\u00e9 de d\u00e9celer s\u2019il se d\u00e9gage des faits ne serait-ce que de subtiles odeurs de discrimination afin de d\u00e9terminer si une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans une conduite contest\u00e9e.\n[171] Dans le cas o\u00f9 la preuve est circonstancielle, le Tribunal peut tirer une conclusion de discrimination si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019appui des all\u00e9gations permettent d\u2019inf\u00e9rer que, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, la conduite en cause \u00e9tait plus probablement discriminatoire que le contraire.\n[172] Outre les observations des parties, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 les transcriptions de l\u2019audience et les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve concernant la question du lien entre la conduite de M. Sawchuk et le sexe de Mme Young. \u00c0 la suite de cet examen, et compte tenu aussi bien des incidents particuliers que du comportement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de M. Sawchuk, j\u2019estime disposer de suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre la conduite de M. Sawchuk et le sexe de Mme Young.\n[173] Cette conclusion repose sur deux points principaux :\na) Somme toute, la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience milite en faveur de la conclusion selon laquelle M. Sawchuk r\u00e9servait aux femmes \u2014 dont Mme Young \u2014 qui n\u2019adh\u00e9raient pas \u00e0 sa fa\u00e7on de travailler un traitement diff\u00e9rent de celui qu\u2019il adoptait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des hommes avec lesquels il avait des d\u00e9saccords semblables;\nb) Le sexe de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans certains des incidents particuliers en cause qui, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a conclu, sont assimilables \u00e0 un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable.\n[174] J\u2019exposerai plus amplement chacun de ces points ci-dessous.\na)M. Sawchuk traitait diff\u00e9remment des hommes les femmes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019accord avec lui\n[175] Plusieurs des t\u00e9moins ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019avec les femmes qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019accord avec lui, M. Sawchuk se comportait de mani\u00e8re plus agressive qu\u2019avec les hommes, et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait plus enclin \u00e0 tenter d\u2019imposer aux employ\u00e9es de sexe f\u00e9minin sa fa\u00e7on de voir le travail des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives. Ces d\u00e9clarations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es par des t\u00e9moins de VIA, qui ont indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas vu M. Sawchuk traiter les femmes diff\u00e9remment des hommes.\n[176] Plusieurs des t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par Mme Young ont d\u00e9peint M. Sawchuk comme quelqu\u2019un qui avait un probl\u00e8me avec les femmes. Leur t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait coh\u00e9rent et corroborait celui de Mme Young.\n[177] Les t\u00e9moins appel\u00e9s par VIA, dont M. Sawchu, qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet des interactions de M. Sawchuk avec les femmes, ont soit ni\u00e9 qu\u2019il traitait les femmes et les hommes diff\u00e9remment, soit d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas observ\u00e9 ce comportement chez lui et ne se souvenaient pas des incidents pr\u00e9cis qui leur avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9s en contre-interrogatoire.\n[178] Les t\u00e9moignages fournis respectivement par ces deux groupes de t\u00e9moins ne sont pas conciliables, du moins en partie. C\u2019est pourquoi je dois d\u00e9terminer lesquels il me faut privil\u00e9gier afin de rendre ma d\u00e9cision. Comme l\u2019ont soulign\u00e9 VIA et la Commission dans leurs observations finales, cette question cruciale se r\u00e9sume, pour le Tribunal, \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de deux ensembles de t\u00e9moignages incompatibles.\n[179] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait vu M. Sawchuk traiter ses coll\u00e8gues masculins diff\u00e9remment d\u2019elle, m\u00eame lorsqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient en d\u00e9saccord avec lui, et qu\u2019il traitait les femmes diff\u00e9remment en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. MM. Arsenault et Micallef ont eux aussi indiqu\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk traitait les femmes de mani\u00e8re diff\u00e9rente. M. Micallef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en ce qui concerne les employ\u00e9es de sexe f\u00e9minin, M. Sawchuk les confronte jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles acceptent de faire leur travail de la fa\u00e7on qu\u2019il pr\u00e9f\u00e8re.\n[180] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question du Tribunal, M. Micallef a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nOuais, bien, quand il a un probl\u00e8me avec un employ\u00e9 masculin, il ne vient pas nous voir. Il va voir le gestionnaire, et il demande qu\u2019un membre de la direction nous parle. Que ce soit justifi\u00e9 ou pas, il y va, et il se plaint \u00e0 notre sujet. Mais dans le cas des femmes, il fait juste \u2014 il est juste sur leur dos, il les harc\u00e8le : \u00ab Tu dois proc\u00e9der de cette fa\u00e7on-l\u00e0; il faut que tu fasses comme \u00e7a \u00bb. Mais avec nous, il ne nous dit pas \u00e7a, surtout [que] nous connaissons notre travail.\n[181] Ce t\u00e9moignage de M. Micallef a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9 par celui d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, y compris des gestionnaires de VIA, selon qui M. Sawchuk vient souvent les voir pour se plaindre d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s. M\u00eame si la r\u00e9ticence de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 d\u00e9fier directement ses coll\u00e8gues masculins s\u2019explique en partie par le fait qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 maltrait\u00e9 par eux par le pass\u00e9, comme il l\u2019a affirm\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage, la diff\u00e9rence de traitement qui en r\u00e9sulte pour Mme Young, ou pour d\u2019autres femmes ne se conformant pas d\u2019embl\u00e9e \u00e0 sa m\u00e9thode de pr\u00e9dilection, n\u2019en est pas moins discriminatoire.\n[182] M. Anroop a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 au sujet d\u2019une insulte sexiste qu\u2019avait prononc\u00e9e M. Sawchuk en parlant de Mme Young et d\u2019une autre coll\u00e8gue. M. Anroop a affirm\u00e9 avoir entendu M. Sawchuk parler de quelqu\u2019un qui se trouvait \u00e0 bord d\u2019un train comme d\u2019une [traduction] \u00ab maudite salope \u00bb, apr\u00e8s quoi il avait vu Mme Young en descendre. M. Anroop a dit avoir alors compris que M. Sawchuk faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Mme Young en utilisant ces insultes. M. Anroop a \u00e9galement d\u00e9crit un incident o\u00f9 M. Sawchuk avait trait\u00e9 une autre coll\u00e8gue de [traduction] \u00ab maudite salope \u00bb. En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une s\u00e9rie de questions du Tribunal, M. Anroop a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk manquait de respect envers les femmes et qu\u2019il les rabaissait.\n[183] Dans son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal, M. Sawchuk a ni\u00e9 qu\u2019il traitait ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin diff\u00e9remment. Citant \u00e0 l\u2019appui sa relation avec deux autres coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin, il a affirm\u00e9 avoir d\u00e9j\u00e0 travaill\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres femmes sans probl\u00e8me par le pass\u00e9. Le Tribunal observe que, hormis Mme Young, aucune des femmes travaillant directement avec M. Sawchuk n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[184] M. Medeiros, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de Mme Selesnic, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas vu M. Sawchuk traiter les femmes diff\u00e9remment. Cependant, ces deux t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne travaillaient directement avec M. Sawchuk que rarement, voire pas du tout.\n[185] M. Hamilton, qui agissait comme superviseur direct du quart de nuit, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait vu M. Sawchuk traiter tout le monde de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, et qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord pour dire que celui-ci traitait les femmes diff\u00e9remment. Cependant, malgr\u00e9 son titre de superviseur, il semblait ne pas avoir eu connaissance de certains incidents relatifs \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk dont d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins avaient fait \u00e9tat. En contre-interrogatoire, il a aussi dit ne pas se souvenir qu\u2019une autre femme affect\u00e9e au m\u00eame quart de travail avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte au sujet du comportement de M. Sawchuk.\n[186] VIA a fait valoir que le Tribunal devrait \u00e9carter les t\u00e9moignages de Mme Young et de MM. Anroop, Arsenault et Micallef, pour les raisons suivantes :\nLa perception des faits de Mme Young \u00e9tait d\u00e9form\u00e9e par son m\u00e9pris pour M. Sawchuk;\nLes personnes cit\u00e9es par Mme Young pour t\u00e9moigner du comportement de M. Sawchuk envers les femmes \u2014 et, en particulier, envers celles qui ne sont pas d\u2019accord avec lui \u2014 ne sont pas fiables, en raison de l\u2019animosit\u00e9 que ces personnes \u00e9prouvent \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[187] VIA a ajout\u00e9 que, en ce qui concerne la question qui nous occupe, je devrais accorder pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance au t\u00e9moignage de M. Sawchuk par rapport \u00e0 celui de Mme Young.\n[188] La Commission, quant \u00e0 elle, n\u2019a pas pris position sur les questions de cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 qui se posent au Tribunal.\n[189] De fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, bien que le Tribunal ait conclu que le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young pouvait ne pas \u00eatre fiable dans certains cas, ou que celle-ci pouvait avoir r\u00e9agi de mani\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 un incident donn\u00e9, j\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que son t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait, dans l\u2019ensemble, sinc\u00e8re et v\u00e9ridique. J\u2019ai aussi constat\u00e9 que la majeure partie de son t\u00e9moignage concernant la pr\u00e9sente question a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9e par des documents et par d\u2019autres r\u00e9cits de t\u00e9moins ou n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e par VIA.\n[190] Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait \u00e9galement partag\u00e9. Certains passages de sa d\u00e9position m\u2019ont paru sinc\u00e8res et v\u00e9ridiques, par exemple lorsqu\u2019il a relat\u00e9 sa propre exp\u00e9rience de harc\u00e8lement et de mauvais traitements de la part de certains de ses coll\u00e8gues, ainsi que sa frustration face \u00e0 l\u2019inaction de la direction. Toutefois, sa d\u00e9position \u00e9tait aussi incoh\u00e9rente sur un certain nombre de points. Par exemple, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une question o\u00f9 l\u2019avocat de VIA avait parl\u00e9 du nettoyage des vitres de train comme d\u2019un [traduction] \u00ab travail cochonn\u00e9 \u00bb, M. Sawchuk a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019utilisait pas de langage color\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019adressait \u00e0 ses partenaires. Mais le Tribunal a pu constater que M. Sawchuk avait bel et bien lanc\u00e9 des jurons \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues et employ\u00e9 un langage grossier \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. M. Sawchuk a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 ne pas comprendre le fondement de l\u2019enqu\u00eate en milieu de travail ni celui des sanctions disciplinaires qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es, bien qu\u2019il ait particip\u00e9 au processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate et insist\u00e9 pour que le syndicat conteste les r\u00e9sultats de celle-ci par voie de grief jusqu\u2019\u00e0 se rendre en arbitrage, la troisi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de la proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e8glement des griefs.\n[191] M\u00eame \u00e0 supposer que le Tribunal \u00e9carte les t\u00e9moignages de M. Sawchuk et de Mme Young au motif qu\u2019il pourrait s\u2019agir de t\u00e9moignages int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, le Tribunal se retrouve, d\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, avec les d\u00e9positions de coll\u00e8gues de quart ayant travaill\u00e9 avec M. Sawchuk pendant de nombreuses ann\u00e9es, qui soutiennent la position de Mme Young et ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement qui lui \u00e9tait r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u2014 et, dans le cas de M. Anroop, du recours \u00e0 une insulte sexiste en r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Mme Young et \u00e0 une autre coll\u00e8gue de sexe f\u00e9minin. Et de l\u2019autre c\u00f4t\u00e9, il y a les t\u00e9moignages de deux cadres de VIA, dont aucun n\u2019a travaill\u00e9 directement avec M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pertinente. Et m\u00eame s\u2019il lui \u00e9tait clairement loisible de le faire, VIA a choisi de ne pas citer Mmes Kindt ou Trepanier \u2014 les deux autres femmes qui travaillaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque avec M. Sawchuk pendant le m\u00eame quart de nuit que lui \u2014 pour qu\u2019elles t\u00e9moignent \u00e0 l\u2019audience de leur exp\u00e9rience de travail avec M. Sawchuk.\n[192] La question dont est saisi le Tribunal ne consiste pas \u00e0 savoir si M. Sawchuk m\u00e9prise toutes les femmes ou s\u2019il est incapable de travailler avec elles. En fait, pour que la discrimination soit \u00e9tablie, il n\u2019est m\u00eame pas n\u00e9cessaire que le sexe de Mme Young ait \u00e9t\u00e9 le facteur principal ou intentionnel des actes de M. Sawchuk; il suffit qu\u2019il ait \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur.\n[193] Selon ce que j\u2019ai observ\u00e9 de M. Sawchuk au cours de son t\u00e9moignage, il se peut qu\u2019il ne soit sinc\u00e8rement pas conscient de la mani\u00e8re dont ses actes constituent de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, ou encore, qu\u2019il ignore la nature genr\u00e9e de ses agissements au travail. Par exemple, il a d\u00e9crit positivement une partenaire de sexe f\u00e9minin en disant qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab suivait bien les instructions \u00bb, ce qui est apparu comme un compliment \u00e9trange venant de quelqu\u2019un qui n\u2019\u00e9tait ni le gestionnaire, ni le superviseur de cette personne. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 troubl\u00e9e par les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve attestant l\u2019utilisation r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9e, par M. Sawchuk, d\u2019une insulte sexiste dans ses acc\u00e8s de col\u00e8re contre ses coll\u00e8gues.\n[194] En ce qui concerne les all\u00e9gations pr\u00e9cises formul\u00e9es contre M. Sawchuk au sujet de son attitude \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00e9carter les d\u00e9positions sous serment de nombreux t\u00e9moins qui ont fait part de leur exp\u00e9rience et de leurs observations directes selon lesquelles M. Sawchuk manque de respect envers les femmes et les traite de mani\u00e8re plus agressive que ses coll\u00e8gues masculins. Le t\u00e9moignage de M. Anroop, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9cise de sa propre observation de M. Sawchuk utilisant un langage sexiste, a particuli\u00e8rement convaincu le Tribunal. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Anroop a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par le t\u00e9moin de VIA, M. Hamilton, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne croyait pas que M. Anroop \u00e9tait malhonn\u00eate ou inventait des histoires.\n[195] En parvenant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente conclusion, je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que je ne remets pas en question la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des d\u00e9positions de M. Medeiros et de Mme Selesnic. Si leur t\u00e9moignage au sujet de la relation de travail de M. Sawchuk avec ses coll\u00e8gues f\u00e9minines est jug\u00e9 moins fiable, c\u2019est simplement parce qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas souvent eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019observer M. Sawchuk au travail. La cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Hamilton n\u2019est pas remise en question non plus. Ces trois t\u00e9moins ont eu moins d\u2019occasions d\u2019observer M. Sawchuk ou ne se souvenaient pas des incidents pr\u00e9cis au sujet desquels ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9s. Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne peux accorder autant de poids \u00e0 leurs t\u00e9moignages concernant les relations de M. Sawchuk avec ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin que j\u2019en accorde aux autres.\n[196] Je suis encline \u00e0 accepter qu\u2019\u00e0 un moment donn\u00e9 au cours de la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 Mme Young a v\u00e9cu du harc\u00e8lement de la part de M. Sawchuk, sa peur et son traumatisme (terme que je ne pr\u00e9tends pas utiliser dans un sens clinique) ont peut-\u00eatre entra\u00een\u00e9 chez elle une hypersensibilit\u00e9 aux actions et aux motivations de M. Sawchuk. Pour autant que cette sensibilit\u00e9 accrue ait pu avoir influenc\u00e9 sa perception et son interpr\u00e9tation des incidents qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cus, j\u2019en ai tenu compte au moment d\u2019\u00e9valuer le poids \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage sur certains points. N\u00e9anmoins, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure que cette \u00e9ventualit\u00e9 rend Mme Young indigne de confiance en tant que t\u00e9moin. Il me para\u00eet plus appropri\u00e9 de comprendre le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young comme \u00e9tant empreint d\u2019un sentiment de peur accru, ce qui a pour effet de confirmer, plut\u00f4t que de contredire, la nature traumatisante et l\u2019importance de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cue.\n[197] En d\u2019autres termes, un \u00e9v\u00e9nement dont l\u2019effet perturbateur pourrait \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 3 sur une \u00e9chelle de 10 par une autre personne sera ressenti par Mme Young comme se situant \u00e0 7 sur cette m\u00eame \u00e9chelle. On trouve un exemple de cette dynamique \u00e0 l\u2019\u0153uvre dans l\u2019incident du 5 septembre 2012 au poste de ravitaillement.\n[198] Cela dit, dans bien des cas, la preuve de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 corrobor\u00e9e par d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, de m\u00eame qu\u2019\u00e9tay\u00e9e par la conclusion de VIA elle-m\u00eame selon laquelle M. Sawchuk avait eu un comportement non professionnel enfreignant le Code de conduite de la compagnie (ce qui lui avait valu des sanctions disciplinaires importantes). Bien que nous ne disposions pas, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, d\u2019un rapport r\u00e9dig\u00e9 suite \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, ni du raisonnement \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la d\u00e9cision de frapper M. Sawchuk de mesures disciplinaires pour avoir enfreint le Code de conduite, j\u2019estime que les t\u00e9moignages relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne de VIA cadrent davantage avec la version des faits de Mme Young qu\u2019avec celle de M. Sawchuk.\n[199] Tout compte fait, le Tribunal conclut que, selon toute vraisemblance, M. Sawchuk a, dans l\u2019ensemble, trait\u00e9 certaines coll\u00e8gues de sexe f\u00e9minin diff\u00e9remment et de mani\u00e8re plus agressive que ses coll\u00e8gues de sexe masculin.\nb)Le sexe a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans certains incidents particuliers\n[200] Outre la preuve g\u00e9n\u00e9rale concernant l\u2019attitude de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes, certains des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s dans la plainte de Mme Young sont implicitement genr\u00e9s et reposent sur une conduite que, selon moi, une femme raisonnable plac\u00e9e dans les m\u00eames circonstances ressentirait comme un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur le sexe.\n[201] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, j\u2019estime que l\u2019incident au cours duquel M. Sawchuk a refus\u00e9 de se d\u00e9placer alors qu\u2019il se trouvait derri\u00e8re Mme Young, malgr\u00e9 le malaise et la demande en ce sens de celle-ci, fait intervenir des questions li\u00e9es au sexe et au fait que Mme Young puisse se sentir mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise de se pencher, avec son corps de femme, devant un coll\u00e8gue masculin.\n[202] De m\u00eame, l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Sawchuk est mont\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e9chelle de la cabine alors que Mme Young \u00e9tait en train d\u2019en descendre a fait entrer en jeu des questions li\u00e9es au sexe et au fait que Mme Young ait pu se sentir inconfortable lorsque son corps de femme, au moment o\u00f9 elle descendait, s\u2019\u00e9tait retrouv\u00e9 au-dessus de la t\u00eate\/du visage de M. Sawchuk.\n[203] Mme Young a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en tant que femme, elle \u00e9prouvait un sentiment accru de peur et de vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 dans la grande zone industrielle o\u00f9 elle et M. Sawchuk travaillaient. Certains secteurs du CMT n\u2019\u00e9taient pas bien \u00e9clair\u00e9s, et Mme Young a expliqu\u00e9 avoir craint pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9. D\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, dont M. Arsenault, ont dit que Mme Young semblait avoir peur et se sentir mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise de c\u00f4toyer M. Sawchuk dans la gare de triage.\n[204] Le Tribunal ne laisserait en aucun cas entendre que ce genre de peur est une exp\u00e9rience universellement v\u00e9cue par les femmes, ou m\u00eame qu\u2019il s\u2019agirait de la seule r\u00e9action justifi\u00e9e dans les circonstances d\u00e9crites par Mme Young dans ses observations. Toutefois, je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019argument de Mme Young selon lequel, en tant que femme, le genre de peur qu\u2019elle ressentait la nuit, dans la vaste et sombre gare de triage du secteur industriel, avait pour elle des effets distincts comparativement \u00e0 ses coll\u00e8gues masculins. Autrement dit, Mme Young a v\u00e9cu une exp\u00e9rience propre \u00e0 son sexe du fait de la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, vu la nature de leurs fonctions et le milieu de travail qui \u00e9tait le leur.\n[205] Les all\u00e9gations qui se rapportent au fait d\u2019\u00eatre surveill\u00e9e par un coll\u00e8gue avec qui l\u2019on a (au minimum) une relation tendue sont peut-\u00eatre plus d\u00e9licates. Enfin, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, dans les milieux de travail caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par un privil\u00e8ge historique favorisant un groupe par rapport \u00e0 un autre, des commentaires sur des caract\u00e9ristiques li\u00e9es au sexe, comme la voix d\u2019une femme ou le fait qu\u2019elle soit habill\u00e9e de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e ou non pour le milieu de travail, comportent \u00e9galement un \u00e9l\u00e9ment relatif au sexe.\n[206] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que le sexe de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans le traitement pr\u00e9judiciable que M. Sawchuk lui a r\u00e9serv\u00e9.\n[207] Ayant r\u00e9pondu par l\u2019affirmative aux trois questions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore (si Mme Young a un motif de distinction illicite prot\u00e9g\u00e9, si elle a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable et si le motif de distinction illicite prot\u00e9g\u00e9 de Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable), je conclus que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young a contrevenu \u00e0 la Loi en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 7b).\n2. Harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe (al. 14(1)c) de la LCDP) [208] Mme Young et la Commission ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la conduite de M. Sawchuk constituait du harc\u00e8lement, et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait par cons\u00e9quent incompatible avec les protections pr\u00e9vues par l\u2019article 14 de la Loi.\n[209] Je n\u2019ai pas l\u2019intention de r\u00e9p\u00e9ter ici mon analyse de la conduite de M. Sawchuk, car je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9e en d\u00e9tail ci-dessus, tout comme j\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9 des conclusions factuelles au sujet des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s et du lien entre ces incidents et l\u2019identit\u00e9 de Mme Young en tant que femme. Cependant, comme la plaignante et la Commission ont express\u00e9ment all\u00e9gu\u00e9 le harc\u00e8lement, et puisque l\u2019analyse que commande une plainte fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 14 diff\u00e8re quelque peu de l\u2019analyse suivant le crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, le Tribunal, par souci d\u2019exhaustivit\u00e9, passera bri\u00e8vement en revue chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu violation de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi. Il appliquera ensuite ce crit\u00e8re aux faits particuliers de l\u2019affaire.\n[210] Le crit\u00e8re relatif \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Morin. En appliquant les quatre \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Morin aux faits de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera si :\nLa conduite de M. Sawchuk est li\u00e9e \u00e0 la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e de Mme Young (son sexe);\nLes actes de M. Sawchuck \u00e9taient importuns;\nLa conduite de M. Sawchuck comportait l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de persistance requis ou encore un seul incident qui \u00e9tait suffisamment grave pour constituer du harc\u00e8lement;\nMme Young a avis\u00e9 VIA, l\u2019employeur, de la pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e conduite offensante.\ni. La conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait li\u00e9e au sexe de Mme Young\n[211] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019analyse d\u00e9j\u00e0 expos\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment concernant le lien entre la conduite de M. Sawchuk et le sexe de Mme Young, j\u2019estime que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait au moins en partie li\u00e9e \u00e0 une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\nii. La conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait importune\n[212] Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail plus haut, Mme Young a indiqu\u00e9 clairement et \u00e0 maintes reprises, tant \u00e0 M. Sawchuk qu\u2019\u00e0 VIA, que la conduite de ce dernier \u00e9tait importune, et qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise en sa pr\u00e9sence. Nul n\u2019a laiss\u00e9 entendre au Tribunal que cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment du crit\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tabli.\niii. La conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait persistante\n[213] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, la s\u00e9rie d\u2019incidents au fondement de la pr\u00e9sente plainte repr\u00e9sente une conduite persistante et d\u2019une dur\u00e9e prolong\u00e9e. M\u00eame si, sur certains points, j\u2019ai jug\u00e9 que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis au Tribunal \u00e9taient insuffisants pour justifier une conclusion de fait, la preuve dans son ensemble ne laisse planer aucun doute sur le fait que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une conduite \u00e0 la fois persistante, non professionnelle, inappropri\u00e9e et importune. Cette conclusion est en outre corrobor\u00e9e par les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne men\u00e9e par VIA elle-m\u00eame sur la conduite de M. Sawchuk, r\u00e9sultats selon lesquels sa conduite \u00e9tait inconvenante.\niv. Mme Young a avis\u00e9 VIA de la conduite en cause\n[214] Les parties ont convenu que la question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de l\u2019employeur.\n[215] VIA a fait valoir que, lorsqu\u2019elle avait re\u00e7u la premi\u00e8re plainte de Mme Young, en janvier 2012, elle n\u2019avait pas compris la gravit\u00e9 des dol\u00e9ances qu\u2019elle contenait ni consid\u00e9r\u00e9 le probl\u00e8me comme \u00e9tant du harc\u00e8lement (une question que j\u2019examinerai plus en d\u00e9tail ci\u2011dessous). Il est vrai qu\u2019au moment o\u00f9 Mme Young s\u2019\u00e9tait plainte pour la premi\u00e8re fois, la situation \u00e9tait loin d\u2019\u00eatre aussi grave qu\u2019elle finirait par le devenir avant que VIA ne prenne des mesures. Toutefois, le Tribunal est convaincu que la lettre de plainte initiale de Mme Young, envoy\u00e9e en janvier 2012, \u00e9tait suffisante pour aviser VIA de l\u2019existence d\u2019un probl\u00e8me entre elle et M. Sawchuk \u2014 notamment parce que plusieurs incidents de conduite non professionnelle s\u2019\u00e9taient produits \u2014 et de la possibilit\u00e9 que la Loi entre en application. Apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 mise au courant de la situation, VIA aurait d\u00fb prendre des mesures proactives pour surveiller la situation entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk et s\u2019assurer qu\u2019elle ne continuait pas de s\u2019aggraver. Au lieu de quoi, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal indiquent que M. Hamilton, qui a re\u00e7u la plainte de Mme Young en janvier 2012, a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que l\u2019affaire \u00e9tait r\u00e9gl\u00e9e apr\u00e8s sa discussion avec M. Sawchuk et n\u2019a pris aucune autre mesure proactive pour g\u00e9rer la situation.\n[216] Mme Young a ensuite d\u00e9pos\u00e9, en mars 2013 une plainte d\u00e9taill\u00e9e comportant neuf lettres de plainte o\u00f9 \u00e9taient d\u00e9crits de nombreux incidents, apr\u00e8s quoi VIA a finalement ouvert une enqu\u00eate.\n[217] D\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal, il ne fait aucun doute que VIA a \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9e des pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Young.\n[218] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de l\u2019analyse qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, je conclus que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Young constituait du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe, en contravention de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, qui offre des protections \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n3. Harc\u00e8lement sexuel (par. 14(2) de la LCDP) [219] \u00c0 l\u2019audience et dans certaines observations finales, les parties ont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la plainte en tant que plainte de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, et la Commission, en particulier, a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations sur le sujet.\n[220] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 tir\u00e9 des conclusions concernant les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe en tant que caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c) de la Loi, mais \u00e0 mon avis, il est \u00e9galement utile de traiter des all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement sexuel en regard du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Franke.\n[221] Le Tribunal conclura \u00e0 l\u2019existence de harc\u00e8lement sexuel si la preuve \u00e9tablit :\n1) que la partie s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une conduite importune;\n2) que la conduite reproch\u00e9e est de nature sexuelle;\n3) qu\u2019il y avait soit un comportement persistant, soit un seul incident grave;\n4) que l\u2019employ\u00e9 a avis\u00e9 l\u2019employeur du harc\u00e8lement sexuel pr\u00e9sum\u00e9, lorsque l\u2019employeur dispose d\u2019un service des ressources humaines et qu\u2019une politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et efficace en mati\u00e8re de lutte contre le harc\u00e8lement sexuel ainsi que des m\u00e9canismes de redressement sont en place.\n[222] J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que M. Sawchuk s\u2019est livr\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre Mme Young, \u00e0 des comportements de harc\u00e8lement assimilables \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur le sexe, et je n\u2019entends pas r\u00e9p\u00e9ter l\u2019analyse pertinente ici.\n[223] M. Sawchuk s\u2019est livr\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on soutenue et persistante \u00e0 une conduite qui \u00e9tait, du moins en partie, li\u00e9e au sexe de Mme Young; ainsi, les premier et troisi\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Franke sont remplis. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement conclu que Mme Young avait port\u00e9 ce comportement \u00e0 l\u2019attention de son employeur, comme l\u2019exige le quatri\u00e8me \u00e9l\u00e9ment du m\u00eame crit\u00e8re.\n[224] Cependant, je ne suis pas convaincue, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait de nature sexuelle.\n[225] Dans ses observations, la Commission a fait valoir que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre de nature sexuelle. Selon elle, il peut inclure un comportement sexiste, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qui vise un sexe et non l\u2019autre, par exemple un comportement offensant ou humiliant bas\u00e9 sur le sexe d\u2019une personne, des remarques sexistes sur les caract\u00e9ristiques physiques de la personne ou des agressions verbales sexistes.\n[226] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 constat\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il est clair que, pour que le Tribunal puisse conclure \u00e0 du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le genre (le \u00ab sexe \u00bb, selon la Loi), il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire qu\u2019il y ait eu un comportement de nature sexuelle. Cependant, pour \u00e9viter toute confusion, il m\u2019appara\u00eet n\u00e9cessaire de faire la distinction entre le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe (une forme de comportement discriminatoire qui est li\u00e9e au sexe ou au genre d\u2019une personne, et qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(1)c)) et le harc\u00e8lement sexuel (qui, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le paragraphe 14(2), est un sous-ensemble du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe qui suppose un comportement de nature sexuelle). \u00c0 mon sens, il est important de distinguer entre les deux types de harc\u00e8lement : le deuxi\u00e8me est un sous-ensemble distinct du premier.\n[227] Bien que j\u2019aie conclu que la conduite de M. Sawchuk constitue du harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 caract\u00e8re sexiste (ou, aux termes de la Loi, du harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur le sexe), je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e9tayent une conclusion selon laquelle ce harc\u00e8lement aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 de nature sexuelle, au sens voulu par le paragraphe 14(2).\n[228] Par cons\u00e9quent, je rejette les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles la conduite de M. Sawchuk aurait contrevenu au paragraphe 14(2) de la Loi.\nB. VIA est responsable de la conduite discriminatoire au regard de l\u2019art. 65 de la LCDP [229] D\u00e8s lors que le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la conduite de M. Sawchuck en milieu de travail \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 la Loi, il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, VIA, de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre tenue responsable des actes de M. Sawchuk.\n[230] L\u2019article 65 de la LCDP \u00e9nonce qu\u2019un employeur est r\u00e9put\u00e9 responsable de la conduite de ses employ\u00e9s, \u00e0 moins de pouvoir \u00e9tablir :\nqu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019employ\u00e9;\nqu\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher;\nqu\u2019il a par la suite pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour att\u00e9nuer ou annuler les effets n\u00e9fastes de cette conduite.\n[231] La jurisprudence du Tribunal \u00e9volue de telle sorte qu\u2019il devient de plus en plus clair que, pour pouvoir se pr\u00e9valoir d\u2019une d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019article 65, l\u2019employeur doit d\u00e9montrer que ces trois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes conditions sont r\u00e9unies. Autrement dit, celles-ci ne sont pas des moyens de d\u00e9fense subsidiaires. L\u2019employeur doit prouver qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 la conduite, qu\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et qu\u2019ensuite, il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour att\u00e9nuer ou annuler les effets n\u00e9fastes de la conduite (voir R. L. c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2021 TCDP 33, au par. 198, Aeropro, au par. 194).\n4. Position de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [232] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, VIA a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve montrant qu\u2019une politique contre le harc\u00e8lement \u00e9tait en vigueur au moment des faits en cause. Elle a \u00e9galement soumis des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve attestant l\u2019existence de divers cours de formation offerts \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s (dont certains \u00e9taient obligatoires). En outre, Mme Selesnic, la gestionnaire de VIA qui a men\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne sur la plainte de harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par Mme Young contre M. Sawchuk, a \u00e9t\u00e9 cit\u00e9e comme t\u00e9moin par Mme Young. Le Tribunal a aussi entendu des t\u00e9moignages d\u00e9taill\u00e9s sur l\u2019enqu\u00eate interne que VIA a finalement men\u00e9e et sur les mesures disciplinaires qui y ont fait suite.\n[233] Bien que les parties ne se soient pas attard\u00e9es sur ce point \u00e0 l\u2019audience ni dans leurs observations, je suis pr\u00eate \u00e0 d\u00e9duire des observations de VIA qu\u2019elle consid\u00e8re ne pas avoir express\u00e9ment consenti \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk, et ses observations peuvent \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es comme rejetant toute proposition contraire.\n[234] VIA a fait valoir qu\u2019elle a examin\u00e9, trait\u00e9 et r\u00e9solu avec diligence chacun des probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s par Mme Young, en plus d\u2019avoir consacr\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 enqu\u00eater sur le fondement factuel des incidents soulev\u00e9s par celle-ci. Dans ses observations, VIA a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur le t\u00e9moignage de M. Medeiros selon lequel il avait pass\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab une centaine d\u2019heures \u00bb \u00e0 \u00e9couter des enregistrements de communications radio et \u00e0 les transcrire \u00e0 la main pour pouvoir faire toute la lumi\u00e8re sur les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Young.\n[235] VIA a \u00e9galement avanc\u00e9 que son [traduction] \u00ab enqu\u00eate externe \u00bb \u2014 qui \u00e9tait en fait interne chez VIA, mais externe par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe de travail du quart de nuit du CMT dont Mme Young et M. Sawchuk faisaient partie \u2014 respectait les r\u00e8gles d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, et qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9bouch\u00e9 sur une proc\u00e9dure valable et proportionnelle aux conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[236] Enfin, le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages au sujet des restrictions qui ont progressivement \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9es \u00e0 M. Sawchuk, et qui ont abouti \u00e0 son retrait du poste de pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 aux locomotives qu\u2019il occupait pendant le quart de nuit. VIA a en fait soutenu qu\u2019en retirant M. Sawchuk du lieu de travail de Mme Young pour \u00e9viter tout contact entre les deux, elle \u00e9tait all\u00e9e au-del\u00e0 de toute obligation qu\u2019elle aurait pu avoir en tant qu\u2019employeur compte tenu de la situation.\n[237] VIA a affirm\u00e9 que le fait qu\u2019elle ait impos\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Sawchuk des restrictions \u2014 dont certaines qui auraient semble-t-il empi\u00e9t\u00e9 sur ses droits d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 en vertu de la convention collective applicable \u2014 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait m\u00eame pas l\u00e9galement tenue de lui imposer d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle comprenait la gravit\u00e9 de la situation et qu\u2019elle s\u2019\u00e9tait efforc\u00e9e de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins de Mme Young.\n[238] Dans ses observations finales, VIA a invoqu\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Cassidy c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Raj Thambirajah, 2012 TCDP 29 (CanLII) [Cassidy] pour \u00e9tayer son argument selon lequel, bien que son intervention n\u2019ait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9t\u00e9 parfaite, elle s\u2019\u00e9tait n\u00e9anmoins d\u00fbment acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation de faire preuve de diligence raisonnable, aussi bien avant que ne surviennent les incidents d\u00e9crits dans la plainte qu\u2019en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ceux-ci.\n5. Position de la Commission [239] Dans ses observations finales, en ce qui concerne les mesures prises par VIA \u00e0 la suite des plaintes de Mme Young li\u00e9es \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk, la Commission s\u2019est concentr\u00e9e sur les deux principaux sujets de pr\u00e9occupation suivants : i) la tardivet\u00e9 de l\u2019intervention; et ii) les lacunes dans le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\ni. Intervention tardive [240] La Commission a soutenu que VIA ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation d\u2019enqu\u00eater sans d\u00e9lai sur les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Young concernant la conduite de M. Sawchuk. Elle avait en effet attendu plus d\u2019un an, \u00e0 compter de la date de la plainte initiale (janvier 2012), avant d\u2019entreprendre s\u00e9rieusement de faire enqu\u00eate.\nii. Lacunes dans le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate [241] La Commission a soulev\u00e9 d\u2019autres pr\u00e9occupations li\u00e9es \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e. Elle a soulign\u00e9 que la description donn\u00e9e par Mme Selesnic de son mandat, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019elle devait recueillir de l\u2019information plut\u00f4t que de mener une enqu\u00eate sur le harc\u00e8lement, \u00e9tait contraire au point de vue de la Commission sur ce qui est attendu d\u2019une enqu\u00eate diligente.\n[242] La Commission en a conclu que VIA ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation, pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 65 de la Loi, de mener sans d\u00e9lai une enqu\u00eate approfondie et \u00e9quitable sur les all\u00e9gations et de mettre en place une solution appropri\u00e9e.\n6. Position de la plaignante [243] Tout au long de l\u2019audience, Mme Young a mentionn\u00e9 de nombreuses pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par la r\u00e9ponse de VIA \u00e0 ses plaintes concernant la conduite de M. Sawchuk, en particulier pour ce qui est de la reconnaissance du harc\u00e8lement que celui\u2011ci lui a fait subir et aux mesures prises par la compagnie pour y rem\u00e9dier. Les sujets de pr\u00e9occupation \u00e9taient notamment les suivants :\na) la capacit\u00e9 des gestionnaires \u00e0 bien reconna\u00eetre le harc\u00e8lement, y compris la nature sexiste de certains des incidents d\u00e9crits dans la plainte;\nb) le caract\u00e8re suffisant de la formation offerte aux personnes charg\u00e9es de mener les enqu\u00eates;\nc) le lancement tardif de l\u2019enqu\u00eate;\nd) le manque de transparence dans le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate (y compris lorsque l\u2019on est pass\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte de harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 une violation du Code de conduite) et, surtout, l\u2019absence de tout document \u00e9crit faisant \u00e9tat des conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eate (que la partie ayant ouvert l\u2019enqu\u00eate ait \u00e9t\u00e9 cens\u00e9e recevoir ces conclusions ou non).\n[244] Dans ses observations finales, Mme Young a reconnu que la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement en tant que telle \u00e9tait compl\u00e8te et bien formul\u00e9e.\n7. Analyse de la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite discriminatoire\n[245] La Loi \u00e9tablit clairement que l\u2019employeur doit r\u00e9pondre de la conduite discriminatoire adopt\u00e9e en milieu de travail par son employ\u00e9. Le paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi est libell\u00e9 comme suit :\nSous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), les actes ou omissions commis par un employ\u00e9, un mandataire, un administrateur ou un dirigeant dans le cadre de son emploi sont r\u00e9put\u00e9s, pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par la personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association qui l\u2019emploie.\n[246] Nul n\u2019a contest\u00e9 devant moi que les actes d\u00e9crits dans la plainte de Mme Young ont \u00e9t\u00e9 commis par un employ\u00e9 dans le cadre de son emploi.\n[247] Le paragraphe 65(2) de la Loi pr\u00e9voit une exception \u00e0 cette pr\u00e9somption de responsabilit\u00e9 :\nLa personne, l\u2019organisme ou l\u2019association vis\u00e9 au paragraphe (1) peut se soustraire \u00e0 son application s\u2019il \u00e9tablit que l\u2019acte ou l\u2019omission a eu lieu sans son consentement, qu\u2019il avait pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et que, par la suite, il a tent\u00e9 d\u2019en att\u00e9nuer ou d\u2019en annuler les effets.\n[248] Pour atteindre ce seuil, l\u2019employeur doit \u00eatre intervenu sans d\u00e9lai; il doit avoir pris des mesures pr\u00e9ventives et, par la suite, des mesures att\u00e9nuantes.\n[249] Dans l\u2019\u00e9ventualit\u00e9 o\u00f9 le Tribunal d\u00e9clarerait fond\u00e9e la plainte de Mme Young selon laquelle elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 victime d\u2019une conduite discriminatoire contraire \u00e0 la Loi, VIA a invoqu\u00e9 le paragraphe 65(2) comme moyen de d\u00e9fense contre la responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des agissements d\u2019un employ\u00e9, responsabilit\u00e9 qui, autrement, serait engag\u00e9e au titre du paragraphe 65(1).\n[250] Il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 la conduite contest\u00e9e et qu\u2019il a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher et, par la suite, en att\u00e9nuer les effets (voir Aeropro, aux par. 208 et suivants).\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 des faits pertinents\n[251] Pour la plupart, les faits pertinents qui concernent la r\u00e9ponse de VIA \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk envers Mme Young n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s.\n[252] VIA avait une politique sur le harc\u00e8lement en place au moment des incidents en question.\n[253] VIA a donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ses employ\u00e9s de la formation sur cette politique sur le harc\u00e8lement.\n[254] Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 janvier 2012, Mme Young a soulev\u00e9 pour la premi\u00e8re fois des pr\u00e9occupations au sujet de la conduite de M. Sawchuk (surveillance, photographies et injures de sa part) aupr\u00e8s de la direction de VIA. Plus d\u2019un mois s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant que VIA n\u2019intervienne, et Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, le 17 f\u00e9vrier 2012, le gestionnaire qui avait trait\u00e9 sa plainte avait communiqu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on informelle avec les personnes impliqu\u00e9es et averti M. Sawchuk d\u2019[traduction] \u00ab agir de fa\u00e7on plus professionnelle \u00e0 l\u2019avenir \u00bb, ce dont M. Sawchuk avait convenu \u00e0 contrec\u0153ur.\n[255] Malgr\u00e9 cette r\u00e9ticence affich\u00e9e par M. Sawchuk, VIA n\u2019a fourni aucune preuve indiquant qu\u2019elle aurait effectu\u00e9 un suivi ou pris des mesures pour s\u2019assurer que M. Sawchuk agissait r\u00e9ellement de fa\u00e7on plus professionnelle. Comme il est expliqu\u00e9 en d\u00e9tail dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, la situation a plut\u00f4t continu\u00e9 de se d\u00e9t\u00e9riorer. Cette d\u00e9t\u00e9rioration a parfois, mais pas toujours, \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019attention de la direction de VIA.\n[256] La situation a atteint son paroxysme 14 mois apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re lettre de plainte de Mme Young.\n[257] Le 7 mars 2013, Mme Young a avis\u00e9 M. Hamilton qu\u2019elle ne voulait plus travailler avec M. Sawchuk. Qu\u2019un refus de travailler, au sens de la Loi sur la sant\u00e9 et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 officiellement ou non, Mme Young a parl\u00e9 de sa d\u00e9cision en ces termes. M. Hamilton a dit \u00e0 Mme Young qu\u2019elle devait consigner ses pr\u00e9occupations par \u00e9crit, avec preuves \u00e0 l\u2019appui.\n[258] Le 13 mars 2013, Mme Young a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de VIA neuf lettres de plainte o\u00f9 elle exposait en d\u00e9tail les faits d\u00e9crits dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs et all\u00e9guait que M. Sawchuk s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un comportement inappropri\u00e9 et dangereux.\n[259] Le 21 mars 2013, MM. Hamilton et Medeiros ont rencontr\u00e9 Mme Young. Malgr\u00e9 le large \u00e9ventail d\u2019incidents d\u00e9crits dans les lettres de plainte, la rencontre avait principalement port\u00e9 sur les transmissions radio li\u00e9es \u00e0 certains des incidents soulev\u00e9s dans la plainte de Mme Young dat\u00e9e du 13 mars. Il avait \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 question de la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement et du processus de m\u00e9diation de VIA en la mati\u00e8re.\n[260] Mme Young a clairement fait savoir qu\u2019elle ne voulait pas assister \u00e0 une r\u00e9union avec M. Sawchuk, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00e0 l\u2019aise d\u2019aller en m\u00e9diation.\n[261] Mme Young et M. Medeiros ont tous deux d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Medeiros avait sembl\u00e9 troubl\u00e9 par les all\u00e9gations et par le fait qu\u2019elle ne se soit pas adress\u00e9e \u00e0 lui plus t\u00f4t.\n[262] Le syndicat est ensuite intervenu, et il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de retirer M. Sawchuk du quart de soir au CMT \u00e0 compter du 23 avril 2013.\n[263] VIA a \u00e9galement d\u00e9cid\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une enqu\u00eate formelle.\n[264] Le 18 avril 2013, Mme Selesnic a lanc\u00e9 une vaste enqu\u00eate pour \u00e9tablir les faits concernant les plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par Mme Young et elle a envoy\u00e9 un avis \u00e0 Mme Young \u00e0 cet effet. On a de nouveau demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young de fournir \u00e0 VIA des pr\u00e9cisions sur ses plaintes.\n[265] Dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de Mme Selesnic, M. Hamilton a fait une d\u00e9claration o\u00f9 il indiquait savoir que M. Sawchuk et Mme Young ne s\u2019entendaient pas, mais ne pas \u00eatre au courant [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019un quelconque harc\u00e8lement se produisait \u00bb. Il a aussi fait remarquer qu\u2019[traduction] \u00ab aucune autre plainte \u00e9crite \u00bb n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue entre le 12 janvier 2012 et le 13 mars 2013.\n[266] Mme Selesnic a interrog\u00e9 onze employ\u00e9s de VIA, dont Mme Young et M. Sawchuk. Mme Young a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que son entrevue avec Mme Selesnic avait pris plus de deux journ\u00e9es de 12 heures.\n[267] \u00c0 un certain moment au cours du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la plainte de harc\u00e8lement de Mme Young serait trait\u00e9e comme une plainte en vertu du Code de conduite. \u00c0 l\u2019audience, aucune explication n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie au sujet de la date et de la raison de cette d\u00e9cision, ni au sujet des personnes qui l\u2019ont prise. Et je ne dispose pas de suffisamment d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour pouvoir tirer des conclusions \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[268] Les t\u00e9moignages portant sur la conclusion de l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9taient confus. Cependant, je puis d\u00e9terminer qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin de son enqu\u00eate, Mme Selesnic a fait un compte rendu verbal de celle-ci \u00e0 M. Medeiros et M. Hamilton. VIA a indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qu\u2019il n\u2019existait aucune trace \u00e9crite des r\u00e9sultats ou des conclusions de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[269] Mme Selesnic a indiqu\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 partie prenante aux conclusions \u00e0 tirer de l\u2019enqu\u00eate approfondie qu\u2019elle avait men\u00e9e. Elle a ajout\u00e9 que, m\u00eame si elle avait elle-m\u00eame men\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate, elle ne s\u2019\u00e9tait pas prononc\u00e9e sur les all\u00e9gations qui y avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es. M. Medeiros, quant \u00e0 lui, a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait particip\u00e9 directement aux d\u00e9cisions sur les suites \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de Mme Selesnic. Le Tribunal a pris connaissance d\u2019un courriel de Mme Blair r\u00e9sumant les mesures que VIA prendrait en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Cependant, lors de son t\u00e9moignage, Mme Blair a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que M. Medeiros avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 des mesures disciplinaires \u00e0 imposer, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, alors qu\u2019elle\u2011m\u00eame avait arr\u00eat\u00e9 toutes les autres mesures \u00e0 prendre par l\u2019organisation, notamment offrir des formations ou apporter des modifications \u00e0 la politique.\n[270] \u00c0 la fin de juin 2013, Mme Young avait rencontr\u00e9 MM. Medeiros et Hamilton, qui l\u2019ont alors inform\u00e9e que l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait termin\u00e9e et que M. Sawchuk avait fait l\u2019objet de mesures disciplinaires. Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincue \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que l\u2019affaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue.\n[271] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young, elle avait demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce qu\u2019on lui fournisse une copie du rapport de Mme Selesnic, mais on ne l\u2019avait pas fait. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, on lui avait dit que Mme Selesnic \u00e9tait absente et que son rapport n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible. VIA a ult\u00e9rieurement inform\u00e9 le Tribunal et les parties qu\u2019un tel rapport n\u2019existait pas.\n[272] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, le 15 juillet 2013, M. Medeiros lui avait \u00e9crit pour lui communiquer les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. La lettre du 15 juillet a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et la Commission en a inclus l\u2019extrait suivant dans ses observations finales :\n[traduction]\n\u00c0 la suite de l\u2019examen des faits et des d\u00e9clarations recueillies, je souhaite vous informer qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir les all\u00e9gations que vous avez formul\u00e9es dans votre plainte. Cependant, les mesures correctives appropri\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises \u00e0 l\u2019endroit de M. Sawchuk. Veuillez noter que la direction veillera \u00e0 ce que le Code de conduite et la Politique sur le harc\u00e8lement soient respect\u00e9s sur le lieu de travail. M. Sawchuk a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 de nos conclusions et du fait que tout autre acte de harc\u00e8lement, d\u2019intimidation ou de repr\u00e9sailles de sa part sera consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une inconduite et ne sera pas tol\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[273] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019enqu\u00eate, une sanction de 25 points d\u2019inaptitude avait \u00e9t\u00e9 inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 M. Sawchuk, et d\u2019autres mesures avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 instaur\u00e9es pour \u00e9viter que les agissements de M. Sawchuk ne se reproduisent.\n[274] Bien qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas permis d\u2019\u00e9liminer enti\u00e8rement les probl\u00e8mes entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk, j\u2019estime que les mesures prises par VIA \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de Mme Selesnic constituaient une r\u00e9ponse raisonnable \u2014 quoique tardive \u2014 dans les circonstances.\nAnalyse de la r\u00e9ponse de VIA \u00e0 la conduite discriminatoire de M. Sawchuk\n[275] \u00c0 l\u2019audience et dans leurs observations finales, la plaignante et la Commission ont insist\u00e9 sur deux points \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels, selon elles, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas agi avec diligence raisonnable \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite de M. Sawchuk :\nle long d\u00e9lai \u00e9coul\u00e9 avant qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate officielle soit amorc\u00e9e;\nla proc\u00e9dure suivie dans le cadre de l\u2019enqu\u00eate elle-m\u00eame.\n[276] Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, pour pouvoir se pr\u00e9valoir de l\u2019exception pr\u00e9vue par la Loi et ainsi se d\u00e9gager de sa responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la conduite d\u2019un employ\u00e9, VIA doit \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, i) qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 la conduite contest\u00e9e; ii) qu\u2019elle a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour l\u2019emp\u00eacher; et iii) qu\u2019elle a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour en att\u00e9nuer les effets.\n[277] Comme VIA et la Commission l\u2019ont fait valoir \u00e0 juste titre dans leurs observations finales respectives, la norme \u00e0 appliquer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard n\u2019est pas celle de la perfection, mais celle du caract\u00e8re raisonnable (Laskowska v. Marinleland of Canada Ltd., 2005 HRTO 30 [Laskowska], au paragraphe 60).\n(i) VIA a-t-elle consenti \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk?\n[278] Bien que les dispositions de la politique de 2007 sur le harc\u00e8lement aient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve devant le Tribunal, il n\u2019en a pas beaucoup \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans les t\u00e9moignages, et elles n\u2019ont gu\u00e8re suscit\u00e9 de d\u00e9bat. Les parties ont admis que la politique de VIA \u00e9tait ad\u00e9quate et que VIA, en tant qu\u2019organisation, n\u2019approuve pas ou ne consent pas au harc\u00e8lement ou \u00e0 la discrimination.\n[279] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui m\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour attester l\u2019existence et la fr\u00e9quence d\u2019une formation \u00e9taient contradictoires, et ils ont clairement fait ressortir que de nombreux employ\u00e9s de VIA, gestionnaires y compris, n\u2019ont pas une compr\u00e9hension nuanc\u00e9e des droits de la personne en milieu de travail et des conditions n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 un environnement de travail exempt de discrimination.\n[280] L\u2019incapacit\u00e9 de plus d\u2019un gestionnaire \u00e0 reconna\u00eetre non seulement l\u2019aspect li\u00e9 au sexe dans les pr\u00e9occupations de Mme Young, mais aussi la mani\u00e8re dont son identit\u00e9 de femme influen\u00e7ait son exp\u00e9rience de la conduite de M. Sawchuk, m\u2019am\u00e8ne \u00e0 conclure que davantage d\u2019efforts et de formation sont n\u00e9cessaires pour s\u2019assurer que les probl\u00e8mes de discrimination soient facilement reconnus dans le lieu de travail.\n[281] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, j\u2019ai certes conclu que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait effectivement discriminatoire, mais je suis convaincue que VIA, et en particulier M. Medeiros, s\u2019inqui\u00e9tait de la conduite de M. Sawchuk, m\u00eame si l\u2019un et l\u2019autre ne comprenaient pas sa nature discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Le retard mis par VIA \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre officiellement \u00e0 la plainte de Mme Young est pr\u00e9occupant, tout comme le fait qu\u2019un certain nombre des inqui\u00e9tudes de Mme Young (exprim\u00e9es directement \u00e0 la direction, mais pas par \u00e9crit) et de M. Dor\u00e9 au sujet de M. Sawchuk semblent, d\u2019apr\u00e8s la preuve dont je dispose, \u00eatre rest\u00e9es sans r\u00e9ponse. Cette intervention tardive a contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 ma conclusion, ci-dessous, selon laquelle VIA n\u2019a pas pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher la conduite de M. Sawchuk. Toutefois, je suis dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure, en me fondant sur la preuve dont je dispose, que VIA n\u2019a pas consenti \u00e0 cette conduite.\n(ii) VIA a-t-elle pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher la conduite discriminatoire de M. Sawchuk?\n[282] La situation expos\u00e9e dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb n\u00e9cessiter la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une plainte \u00e9crite officielle pour que l\u2019employeur intervienne ou s\u2019acquitte de ses obligations pr\u00e9vues par la Loi. Une plainte \u00e9crite peut \u00eatre utile pour examiner des probl\u00e8mes de discrimination, mais plusieurs t\u00e9moins, dont M. Medeiros et M. Hamilton, semblaient croire que, tant que la direction de VIA n\u2019avait pas re\u00e7u de plainte \u00e9crite officielle, ils ne pouvaient rien faire au sujet de la conduite de M. Sawchuk. Ind\u00e9pendamment du contenu de toute politique ou de tout protocole de VIA, cette fa\u00e7on de voir les choses est incompatible avec les obligations qui incombent \u00e0 l\u2019employeur selon la Loi.\n[283] Mme Young a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte initiale en janvier 2012. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9vidence, la situation qui y est d\u00e9crite est beaucoup moins grave que les nombreux incidents compris dans la plainte de mars 2013, mais c\u2019est en partie \u00e0 cause de l\u2019inaction de VIA que la situation s\u2019est aggrav\u00e9e comme elle l\u2019a fait. Si VIA avait fait preuve de plus de rigueur au moment de la plainte initiale et avait agi plus proactivement pour veiller \u00e0 ce que la relation entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk ne s\u2019envenime pas davantage, il est peu probable que la situation aurait atteint un tel niveau de gravit\u00e9.\n[284] Les diverses pr\u00e9occupations signal\u00e9es entre janvier 2012 et mars 2013, y compris dans la note de service de M. Dor\u00e9, n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prises suffisamment au s\u00e9rieux, et il ne semble pas que le comportement de M. Sawchuk et la d\u00e9gradation de ses rapports avec Mme Young aient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s avec diligence pour emp\u00eacher ce qui \u00e9tait, au moins en partie, un comportement discriminatoire en milieu de travail.\n[285] VIA ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e du fardeau qui lui incombait de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher la conduite discriminatoire.\n(iii) VIA a-t-elle pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour att\u00e9nuer ou annuler les effets n\u00e9fastes de la conduite de M. Sawchuk?\n[286] C\u2019est \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci de l\u2019analyse que je chercherai \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019enqu\u00eate de VIA \u00e9tait suffisante et que je r\u00e9pondrai aux nombreuses pr\u00e9occupations soulev\u00e9es par la Commission et la plaignante au sujet du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[287] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, l\u2019obligation de l\u2019employeur de faire enqu\u00eate s\u2019appr\u00e9cie suivant la norme du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, et non suivant celles de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou de la perfection. Dans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario (le \u00ab TDPO \u00bb) a \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ainsi le crit\u00e8re pertinent dont doit tenir compte l\u2019employeur dans son devoir d\u2019enqu\u00eater :\n[traduction]\n1) Sensibilisation aux questions de discrimination\/harc\u00e8lement, m\u00e9canisme de plainte pr\u00e9vu par la politique et formation : \u00e9tait-on sensibilis\u00e9 au probl\u00e8me de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement dans le milieu de travail lors de l\u2019incident? Existait-il une politique anti-discrimination\/harc\u00e8lement appropri\u00e9e? Existait-il un m\u00e9canisme de plainte proprement dit en place? La direction et les employ\u00e9s ont-ils b\u00e9n\u00e9fici\u00e9 d\u2019une formation ad\u00e9quate?;\n2) Apr\u00e8s la plainte : la gravit\u00e9 de l\u2019incident, la rapidit\u00e9 d\u2019intervention, la prise en charge de son employ\u00e9, l\u2019enqu\u00eate et la mesure prise : Apr\u00e8s qu\u2019une plainte interne a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e, l\u2019employeur a-t-il trait\u00e9 le dossier s\u00e9rieusement? A-t-il r\u00e9gl\u00e9 la question rapidement et avec doigt\u00e9? A-t-il men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate et agi de mani\u00e8re raisonnable?;\n3) R\u00e8glement de la plainte (y compris fournir au plaignant un environnement de travail sain) et communication : L\u2019employeur a-t-il propos\u00e9 une solution raisonnable dans les circonstances? Si le plaignant a choisi de retourner au travail, l\u2019employeur pouvait-il lui assurer un environnement de travail sain, exempt de discrimination? A-t-il communiqu\u00e9 ses conclusions et interventions au plaignant?\n[288] Dans la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, le TDPO a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9, au paragraphe 60 :\nBien que les trois \u00e9l\u00e9ments ci-dessus soient de nature g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, leur application doit conserver une certaine souplesse pour tenir compte des faits propres \u00e0 chaque cas. La norme est celle du caract\u00e8re raisonnable, non pas celles de la d\u00e9cision correcte ou de la perfection. Il y aurait eu plusieurs options \u2014 toutes des mesures raisonnables \u2014 auxquelles aurait pu recourir l\u2019employeur. Ce dernier n\u2019est pas tenu de satisfaire \u00e0 chacun des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dans tous les cas afin d\u2019\u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme ayant agi de fa\u00e7on raisonnable, bien que ce serait l\u2019exception plut\u00f4t que la norme. Il faut regarder chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment individuellement, puis dans l\u2019ensemble avant de porter un jugement \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019employeur a agi de mani\u00e8re raisonnable.\n[289] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de savoir si les mesures prises par VIA en r\u00e9action \u00e0 la conduite vis\u00e9e par la plainte satisfaisaient \u00e0 l\u2019exigence consistant \u00e0 prendre toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires, la plaignante et la Commission ont relev\u00e9 deux principaux probl\u00e8mes :\nil avait fallu trop de temps pour intervenir dans une situation qui \u00e9tait dangereuse et se d\u00e9gradait;\nla transparence et les documents n\u00e9cessaires faisaient d\u00e9faut dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[290] Une fois appliqu\u00e9s les facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Laskowska, que le Tribunal a repris \u00e0 son compte dans l\u2019affaire Cassidy, nous constatons que, bien que les mesures finalement prises par VIA pour r\u00e9agir \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk aient permis d\u2019\u00e9liminer les effets discriminatoires de cette conduite sur Mme Young, elles sont survenues apr\u00e8s des mois de pr\u00e9judice qui allait croissant. La proc\u00e9dure d\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la plainte suivie par VIA soul\u00e8ve de s\u00e9rieuses questions sur la transparence et l\u2019ind\u00e9pendance du processus, mais aussi des consid\u00e9rations d\u2019ordre syst\u00e9mique, et elle laisse planer un doute quant \u00e0 savoir si toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises pour \u00e9viter et att\u00e9nuer le pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant de la conduite discriminatoire.\n[291] La capacit\u00e9 du Tribunal \u00e0 \u00e9valuer le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate de VIA est limit\u00e9e, vu l\u2019absence de documentation et de d\u00e9tails li\u00e9s \u00e0 cette enqu\u00eate en particulier. Peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis, voire aucun, sur l\u2019examen et les discussions ayant fait suite aux enseignements recueillis par Mme Selesnic, sur le poids ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 aux diff\u00e9rentes d\u00e9clarations, et sur la fa\u00e7on dont il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que M. Sawchuk avait enfreint le Code de conduite et s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une [traduction] \u00ab conduite inconvenante \u00bb. Toutefois, la preuve indique que cette d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise par MM. Medeiros et Hamilton apr\u00e8s une s\u00e9ance d\u2019information donn\u00e9e par Mme Selesnic, l\u2019enqu\u00eatrice.\n[292] Bien que les d\u00e9clarations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 collig\u00e9es par une enqu\u00eatrice provenant de l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur du CMT, il ressort des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits que la d\u00e9cision finale relative aux suites \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise de mani\u00e8re ind\u00e9pendante, mais par MM. Medeiros et Hamilton, et que les questions organisationnelles plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rales ont \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9es et trait\u00e9es par Mme Blair (quoique rien ne prouve que des changements organisationnels ou syst\u00e9miques aient \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate).\n[293] Cette absence d\u2019ind\u00e9pendance dans la prise de d\u00e9cision n\u2019est manifestement pas compatible avec un processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate ind\u00e9pendant, d\u2019autant plus que l\u2019un des sujets de pr\u00e9occupation qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9s devant moi \u2014 et Mme Young, selon ses dires, avait soulev\u00e9 cette m\u00eame pr\u00e9occupation \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque \u2014 concernait l\u2019inaction de la direction de VIA, notamment de M. Medeiros et de M. Hamilton, au cours des 14 mois suivant la plainte initiale.\n[294] Mme Young a cens\u00e9ment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte pour harc\u00e8lement, mais il ne semble pas que la politique officielle en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement ait \u00e9t\u00e9 appliqu\u00e9e, et les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont je dispose m\u2019am\u00e8nent \u00e0 conclure qu\u2019\u00e0 un certain moment au cours du processus, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que la plainte de Mme Young ne relevait pas de cette politique. La Commission a fait valoir que VIA n\u2019avait men\u00e9 aucune enqu\u00eate en vertu de celle-ci.\n[295] La possibilit\u00e9, pour le Tribunal, de tirer des conclusions sur ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 au cours de l\u2019enqu\u00eate est grandement limit\u00e9e par l\u2019insuffisance de la preuve documentaire produite. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 en soi d\u2019une lacune du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Toutefois, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e de d\u00e9montrer que VIA a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires, elle peut difficilement satisfaire \u00e0 cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment de l\u2019analyse du Tribunal, vu l\u2019absence de preuve.\n[296] M\u00eame s\u2019il ne fait aucun doute que le processus d\u2019entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 approfondi et complet, le Tribunal n\u2019a aucune preuve que le processus d\u00e9cisionnel a \u00e9t\u00e9 tout aussi rigoureux. En fin de compte, puisqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de rapport \u00e9crit ou de t\u00e9moignage clair pour expliquer : les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate; les motifs de la d\u00e9cision de juger non fond\u00e9es les all\u00e9gations de harc\u00e8lement; la d\u00e9cision d\u2019examiner la plainte sous le r\u00e9gime du Code de conduite; les sanctions disciplinaires impos\u00e9es \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate; ce qui a pu si mal tourner dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire; tout changement que VIA pourrait apporter pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019une telle situation ne se reproduise \u00e0 l\u2019avenir avec M. Sawchuk et Mme Young ou avec tout autre employ\u00e9, le Tribunal ne peut \u00eatre convaincu que l\u2019enqu\u00eate respecte le crit\u00e8re de diligence raisonnable applicable.\n[297] En ce qui concerne les mesures ayant finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en place pour r\u00e9gler ce que VIA avait jug\u00e9 \u00eatre une [traduction] \u00ab conduite inconvenante \u00bb, le Tribunal arrive \u00e0 la conclusion que, pendant la p\u00e9riode de juin 2013 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 2013, VIA a pris des mesures de plus en plus restrictives afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distance entre Mme Young et M. Sawchuk, pour finir par retirer celui-ci du quart de nuit.\n[298] Le Tribunal conclut que ces mesures \u00e9taient adapt\u00e9es \u00e0 la gravit\u00e9 de la situation, et qu\u2019elles ont ultimement permis d\u2019emp\u00eacher la conduite discriminatoire gr\u00e2ce au retrait du fautif du lieu de travail.\n[299] Toutefois, le Tribunal observe qu\u2019il ne semble pas que l\u2019on ait pris des moyens pour rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 l\u2019incompr\u00e9hension apparente de M. Sawchuk quant \u00e0 la nature de sa conduite. M\u00eame lorsqu\u2019il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal, soit plusieurs ann\u00e9es apr\u00e8s les faits en cause, M. Sawchuk n\u2019a paru aucunement conscient d\u2019avoir commis des actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles. Il a affirm\u00e9 n\u2019avoir jamais eu d\u2019explications sur ce qu\u2019il avait fait pour justifier les sanctions disciplinaires re\u00e7ues et le fait qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9 de passer au quart de jour.\n[300] Bien que le conflit ait effectivement pris fin, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Sawchuk laisse planer des doutes quant \u00e0 savoir si l\u2019on a v\u00e9ritablement rem\u00e9di\u00e9 \u00e0 la source du conflit, ou si on n\u2019a fait que la d\u00e9placer.\n[301] Je le r\u00e9p\u00e8te : la norme en fonction de laquelle une mesure d\u2019enqu\u00eate sera examin\u00e9e n\u2019est pas celle de la perfection, mais du caract\u00e8re raisonnable. N\u00e9anmoins, l\u2019approche retenue par VIA en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce comporte des lacunes structurelles et proc\u00e9durales qui repr\u00e9sentent un d\u00e9fi insurmontable lorsque vient le moment, pour la compagnie, de s\u2019acquitter de son fardeau de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019elle a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir ou att\u00e9nuer le pr\u00e9judice d\u00e9coulant de la conduite de M. Sawchuk. Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je conclus que VIA n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver que, selon toute vraisemblance, elle a pris toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour rem\u00e9dier aux probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte.\nC. Une indemnisation et des mesures de r\u00e9paration visant la politique sont n\u00e9cessaires pour emp\u00eacher que la situation ne se reproduise [302] D\u00e8s lors que j\u2019ai d\u00e9clar\u00e9 la plainte fond\u00e9e et conclu que VIA n\u2019est pas en mesure de se pr\u00e9valoir du moyen de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vu au paragraphe 65(2) de la Loi, j\u2019examinerai maintenant les recours que le Tribunal peut accorder en vertu des pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration et de pr\u00e9vention qu\u2019il tire de l\u2019article 53 de la Loi.\n[303] Mme Young a demand\u00e9 des r\u00e9parations dont certaines d\u00e9passent la port\u00e9e de ce que la Loi permet au Tribunal d\u2019accorder, notamment des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au titre de la politique sur la violence en milieu de travail ou de la l\u00e9gislation en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail, ainsi que la suppression de clauses relatives \u00e0 des mesures disciplinaires impos\u00e9es qui ne rel\u00e8vent pas des questions sur lesquelles le Tribunal doit statuer.\n[304] Ensemble, Mme Young et la Commission ont relev\u00e9 cinq types de r\u00e9parations que le Tribunal pourrait ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de VIA : 1) des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9; 2) des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e; 3) une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire; 4) les frais engag\u00e9s dans la poursuite de la plainte; 5) des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les montants accord\u00e9s; 6) des r\u00e9parations visant la politique.\n1. Indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019al. 53(2)e) de la LCDP\n[305] Mme Young r\u00e9clame l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $ en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 par le harc\u00e8lement de M. Sawchuk et le traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle a subi au cours de son emploi.\n[306] La Commission n\u2019a pas pris position sur le montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats particuliers qu\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Elle a seulement mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e.\n[307] Par le pass\u00e9, le Tribunal, dans l\u2019exercice de sa discr\u00e9tion en mati\u00e8re de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, a accord\u00e9 le montant maximal permis par la LCDP, soit 20 000 $, dans les cas les plus flagrants de discrimination (Premakumar c. Air Canada, T.D. 03\/02, 4 avril 2002; Aeropro, au par. 272). De plus, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, mais \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9gards, la plaignante doit d\u00e9montrer le lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats r\u00e9clam\u00e9s et l\u2019acte discriminatoire (Chopra c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2007 CAF 268, au par. 32 [Chopra]).\n[308] Les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral visent \u00e0 indemniser la plaignante, dans la mesure du possible, pour le pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019elle a subi et les difficult\u00e9s qu\u2019elle a \u00e9prouv\u00e9es en raison de la discrimination, y compris toute atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9 (Nielsen c. Nee Tahi Buhn Indian Band, 2019 TCDP 50, au par. 142; Beattie et Bangloy c. Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada, 2019 TCDP 45 (CanLII), au par. 206 [Beattie et Bangloy]; Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et autres c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires autochtones et du Nord canadien), 2019 TCDP 39 (CanLII), au par. 223).\n[309] Le Tribunal est convaincu que Mme Young a subi un pr\u00e9judice moral en raison de de la discrimination dont elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime.\n[310] Dans ses observations finales, Mme Young a relat\u00e9 avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 effray\u00e9e, avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 en larmes et avoir connu de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et du stress sans cesse croissants alors que la direction de VIA ne s\u2019occupait pas de ses pr\u00e9occupations. Mme Young a d\u00e9crit d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui paraissait authentique et sinc\u00e8re les effets d\u2019une telle exp\u00e9rience sur sa vie en dehors du travail, en tant que m\u00e8re.\n[311] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement pu observer chez Mme Young ce qui semblait \u00eatre les effets du harc\u00e8lement et de la discrimination, m\u00eame des ann\u00e9es plus tard, dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente instance. Elle avait parfois de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente d\u2019esprit au cours de l\u2019audience et semblait parfois boulevers\u00e9e et d\u00e9pass\u00e9e par ce qu\u2019elle \u00e9prouvait et par les t\u00e9moignages qu\u2019elle entendait. De plus, le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e9tait \u00e9motif et cr\u00e9dible quant aux r\u00e9percussions que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans la plainte ont produites sur elle. Raconter son histoire et parler de ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9tait manifestement tr\u00e8s difficile pour elle, et elle semblait (parfois) vouloir se replier physiquement sur elle\u2011m\u00eame.\n[312] Il est apparu \u00e9vident pour le Tribunal que le traumatisme et la crainte persistants v\u00e9cus par Mme Young en raison des agissements M. Sawchuk ont eu une incidence sur sa perception de ce qui se passait autour d\u2019elle, et lui ont caus\u00e9 une profonde d\u00e9tresse. J\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 \u00e9galement de la col\u00e8re chez Mme Young au moment o\u00f9 elle a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 avoir demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de l\u2019aide et du soutien \u00e0 son employeur, aide qui s\u2019\u00e9tait longtemps fait attendre.\n[313] La d\u00e9tresse et la frustration de Mme Young d\u00e9coulant de son exp\u00e9rience \u00e9taient palpables, et ces sentiments se sont clairement manifest\u00e9s tout au long du processus d\u2019audience. Bien que Mme Young n\u2019ait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve m\u00e9dicale concernant sa sant\u00e9 mentale, son t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 l\u2019audience ne laissait gu\u00e8re de doute sur le fait que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9crits dans sa plainte \u00e9taient graves et continus et qu\u2019ils avaient eu un impact sur sa dignit\u00e9 et son bien-\u00eatre.\n[314] Les actes de M. Sawchuk et la r\u00e9ponse tardive de VIA ont aggrav\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice subi par Mme Young en raison du stress et de la peur qu\u2019elle vivait constamment. Ils ont en outre port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9.\n[315] Le pr\u00e9judice moral subi est \u00e9vident pour le Tribunal, qui n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre convaincu davantage du lien de cause \u00e0 effet entre le pr\u00e9judice moral caus\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Young et les actes discriminatoires (Chopra, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[316] Compte tenu de la gravit\u00e9 des faits en cause et de leur effet important sur la plaignante, qui, m\u00eame au moment de l\u2019audience, semblait encore souffrir des cons\u00e9quences du harc\u00e8lement et de la discrimination, l\u2019octroi d\u2019un montant de 12 000 $ est appropri\u00e9 dans les circonstances (par. 53(2)e) de la LCDP).\n2. Indemnit\u00e9 pour conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e au sens du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP\n[317] La plaignante a demand\u00e9 la somme de 20 000 $ \u2014 soit le montant maximal autoris\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP \u2014 en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux contre VIA en raison de la conduite inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e de celle-ci.\n[318] Le Tribunal a pass\u00e9 19 jours \u00e0 entendre des t\u00e9moignages relatifs au milieu de travail dans lequel Mme Young et M. Sawchuk occupaient leur emploi, et ces t\u00e9moignages ont soulev\u00e9 de s\u00e9rieuses pr\u00e9occupations quant au degr\u00e9 de tol\u00e9rance de l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de comportements abusifs et inappropri\u00e9s en milieu de travail. M\u00eame si, en grande partie, la conduite en cause se situe en dehors de la port\u00e9e de la plainte et, par cons\u00e9quent, \u00e9chappe \u00e0 la comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal, j\u2019estime que la direction de VIA a omis \u00e0 plusieurs reprises d\u2019intervenir dans une situation qui \u00e9tait assur\u00e9ment dysfonctionnelle. Situation qui, par ailleurs, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 le Tribunal, \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 un comportement discriminatoire de la part de M. Sawchuk, l\u2019employ\u00e9 de VIA. M\u00eame si VIA n\u2019a pas su reconna\u00eetre que la conduite de M. Sawchuk \u00e9tait discriminatoire, elle n\u2019a pas non plus s\u00e9rieusement tent\u00e9 de faire valoir que cette conduite n\u2019\u00e9tait pas profond\u00e9ment probl\u00e9matique, ni la relation entre les employ\u00e9s du quart de nuit au CMT, gravement dysfonctionnelle.\n[319] Le fait qu\u2019un conflit en milieu de travail qui s\u2019envenimait, et qui opposait ce que l\u2019on a \u00e0 plusieurs reprises qualifi\u00e9 de diff\u00e9rentes [traduction] \u00ab factions \u00bb, ait \u00e9t\u00e9 balay\u00e9 du revers de la main par la direction comme \u00e9tant une [traduction] \u00ab chicane de famille \u00bb, est tr\u00e8s troublant pour le Tribunal.\n[320] Dans la d\u00e9cision Cassidy, au paragraphe 192, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit ce qui suit :\nLa LCDP et d\u2019autres lois antidiscriminatoires sur les droits de la personne visent \u00e0 \u00ab r\u00e9tablir un plaignant dans sa situation ant\u00e9rieure \u00bb, \u00e0 mettre cette personne dans une position dans laquelle elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 si elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination. La LCDP est une loi r\u00e9paratrice. Elle vise \u00e0 compenser, non pas \u00e0 punir un intim\u00e9. Cela dit, les facteurs aggravants (par opposition aux facteurs punitifs) et att\u00e9nuants sont pertinents le moment venu d\u2019accorder une indemnit\u00e9. La r\u00e9paration doit \u00eatre raisonnable et avoir un lien de causalit\u00e9 avec l\u2019acte discriminatoire dont a constat\u00e9 l\u2019existence.\n[321] En outre, dans la d\u00e9cision Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et autres c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (pour le ministre des Affaires indiennes et du Nord canadien), 2015 TCDP 14 (CanLII), le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9, au paragraphe 22 :\nLa Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a consid\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce paragraphe est une \u00ab [\u2026] disposition punitive visant \u00e0 dissuader ou \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires \u00bb (Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113, au paragraphe 155, d\u00e9cision confirm\u00e9e par 2014 CAF 110 [Johnstone CF]). Une conclusion d\u2019agissement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 exige que \u00ab [\u2026] l\u2019acte discriminatoire et l\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne aient \u00e9t\u00e9 intentionnels \u00bb (Johnstone CF, au paragraphe 155). L\u2019acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 est \u00ab [\u2026] celui qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante \u00bb (Johnstone CF, au paragraphe 155).\n[322] Il faut ajouter que, lorsque le Tribunal d\u00e9cide d\u2019accorder ou non une indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale, il analyse le comportement ou l\u2019inaction de l\u2019intim\u00e9, et non sur l\u2019effet qu\u2019a eu ce comportement sur le plaignant (Beattie et Bangloy, au par. 210).\n[323] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la conduite de l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de nature \u00e0 justifier l\u2019octroi de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux se situant \u00e0 l\u2019extr\u00e9mit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure de la fourchette, comme l\u2019a demand\u00e9 Mme Young. Cependant, je suis convaincue que le fait que VIA ait minimis\u00e9 la conduite abusive et dangereuse sur le lieu de travail pendant le quart de nuit, et qu\u2019elle ait tard\u00e9 \u00e0 apporter une solution efficace et compl\u00e8te \u00e0 ce qui \u00e9tait une dynamique de travail de plus en plus toxique et nocive constitue de \u00ab l\u2019indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences \u00bb. Et cette indiff\u00e9rence a permis qu\u2019une conduite jug\u00e9e discriminatoire persiste trop longtemps.\n[324] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019une grande partie de la conduite d\u00e9crite devant lui d\u00e9passe la port\u00e9e de la plainte dont le Tribunal est saisi en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, et comme je crois que le lien entre la conduite de M. Sawchuk et l\u2019identit\u00e9 de Mme Young en tant que femme n\u2019\u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre pas \u00e9vident pour VIA \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 Mme Young avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses plaintes, l\u2019octroi par le Tribunal de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP sera limit\u00e9 \u00e0 3 000 $.\n3. Dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour perte de salaire fond\u00e9s sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la LCDP\nOccasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire perdues\n[325] La plaignante a soutenu qu\u2019\u00e0 cause du harc\u00e8lement exerc\u00e9 par M. Sawchuk et des restrictions ult\u00e9rieurement impos\u00e9es \u00e0 celui-ci pour \u00e9viter qu\u2019ils n\u2019aient \u00e0 travailler ensemble, elle avait perdu, pendant une p\u00e9riode de sept ans, la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer des quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[326] VIA a fait valoir que, bien que le Tribunal soit habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire, aucune indemnit\u00e9 de la sorte ne devrait \u00eatre accord\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, puisque les pertes de salaire associ\u00e9es au temps suppl\u00e9mentaire n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9es. VIA soutient qu\u2019en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, Mme Young a personnellement choisi d\u2019effectuer moins de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire que par le pass\u00e9. VIA a ajout\u00e9 que cette r\u00e9clamation de Mme Young ne s\u2019appuyait sur aucune preuve pr\u00e9cise, et que l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019\u00e9tait responsable d\u2019aucune perte de salaire.\n[327] La Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations finales concernant les occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire perdues; elle s\u2019en est plut\u00f4t remise \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[328] Mme Young a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 compter de mars ou avril 2012, elle avait commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 refuser des quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires pour \u00e9viter de travailler avec M. Sawchuk. Ce t\u00e9moignage \u00e9tait \u00e9tay\u00e9 par les documents produits devant le Tribunal.\n[329] Mme Young a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 certains moments, on omettait son nom de la liste d\u2019appel pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires, ce que M. Medeiros a valid\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage (bien que les deux t\u00e9moins ne s\u2019entendaient pas sur la fr\u00e9quence d\u2019une telle omission). Certains documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s en preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience corroborent \u00e9galement la conclusion selon laquelle, \u00e0 compter de la premi\u00e8re partie de 2013, Mme Young a \u00e9t\u00e9 omise au moins \u00e0 quelques reprises de la liste d\u2019appel, et je suis convaincue que, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, l\u2019absence de son nom \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de VIA de s\u2019assurer que Mme Young et M. Sawchuk ne travaillent pas ensemble.\n[330] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement entendu les d\u00e9clarations de plusieurs autres t\u00e9moins qui travaillaient au CMT au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente, et qui ont dit que les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires faisaient assez r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement partie de leur travail et qu\u2019en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, beaucoup de quarts suppl\u00e9mentaires disponibles pour les pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives. Ces t\u00e9moignages n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 contredits par aucun autre t\u00e9moin.\n[331] En fait, que Mme Young ait manqu\u00e9 des occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire parce qu\u2019elle ne pouvait avoir la certitude d\u2019\u00eatre en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 au travail, ou parce que VIA avait choisi de ne pas lui proposer d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en raison des pr\u00e9occupations qu\u2019elle avait soulev\u00e9es au sujet de M. Sawchuk, Mme Young a, selon toute vraisemblance, manqu\u00e9 des quarts de travail en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires en 2012 et en 2013 du fait de la conduite de M. Sawchuk.\n[332] Mme Young a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour les occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire perdues sur une p\u00e9riode de sept ans, bien que la preuve relative au montant demand\u00e9 soit plut\u00f4t incoh\u00e9rente et de nature sp\u00e9culative.\n[333] J\u2019ai certes conclu que les occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire perdues apr\u00e8s le premier trimestre de 2012 et jusqu\u2019en 2013 peuvent raisonnablement \u00eatre attribu\u00e9es \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk et aux mesures prises par VIA en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette conduite, \u00e0 la fin de 2013. Cependant, j\u2019ai aussi d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les mesures mises en place par VIA constituaient une r\u00e9ponse suffisante \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk. Je me rends compte que Mme Young a peut-\u00eatre continu\u00e9, apr\u00e8s 2013, d\u2019avoir des r\u00e9serves quant au fait d\u2019accepter des quarts de travail suppl\u00e9mentaires, mais les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve permettent de conclure que VIA s\u2019est occup\u00e9e des agissements de M. Sawchuk de telle fa\u00e7on que Mme Young aurait d\u00fb pouvoir reprendre le travail normalement, en \u00e9tant fortement confiante qu\u2019elle ne travaillerait plus avec M. Sawchuk, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9 au quart de jour.\n[334] En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) de la Loi, le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au titre des occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire perdues lorsqu\u2019il conclut que cette perte d\u00e9coule de la conduite discriminatoire.\n[335] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la conclusion que Mme Young a manqu\u00e9 des occasions d\u2019effectuer des quarts de travail en heures suppl\u00e9mentaires au cours des trois derniers trimestres de 2012 et jusqu\u2019en 2013 en raison de la conduite discriminatoire dont elle a fait l\u2019objet, soit parce qu\u2019elle a refus\u00e9 ces quarts de travail dans le but d\u2019\u00e9viter de travailler avec M. Sawchuk, soit parce que VIA a omis son nom de la liste d\u2019appel pour les heures suppl\u00e9mentaires.\n[336] Il est tr\u00e8s difficile de d\u00e9terminer avec certitude ce que Mme Young aurait fait si VIA avait pu rem\u00e9dier plus t\u00f4t \u00e0 la conduite de M. Sawchuk, combien d\u2019heures suppl\u00e9mentaires Mme Young se serait vu offrir ou \u00e0 quelle fr\u00e9quence elle aurait accept\u00e9 des quarts de travail.\n[337] Le t\u00e9moignage de Mme Young comportait des faiblesses et pr\u00e9sentait un certain degr\u00e9 de sp\u00e9culation ou d\u2019incertitude quant \u00e0 ce qui se serait pass\u00e9, n\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 la conduite de M. Sawchuk. Toutefois, compte tenu de mes conclusions selon lesquelles Mme Young a perdu des occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire \u00e0 cause de la conduite discriminatoire, le Tribunal ne doit pas pour autant jeter la proverbiale \u00e9ponge devant pareilles incertitudes (Kelsh c. Canadien Pacifique, 2019 TCDP 51, au par. 153). Au contraire, \u00e0 l\u2019instar de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, qui a adopt\u00e9 la citation du professeur Waddams dans l\u2019affaire Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes c. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada (2010 CAF 56, conf. par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans 2011 CSC 57), la solution appropri\u00e9e consiste, pour le Tribunal, \u00e0 faire du mieux qu\u2019il peut avec les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont il dispose :\nSi ce montant [de la perte] est difficile \u00e0 estimer, le tribunal doit simplement faire de son mieux \u00e0 partir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments dont il dispose; \u00e9videmment, si la partie demanderesse n\u2019a pas produit une preuve dont on aurait pu s\u2019attendre qu\u2019elle soit produite si la demande \u00e9tait bien fond\u00e9e, son omission sera interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e en sa d\u00e9faveur.\n[338] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve soumis au Tribunal d\u00e9montrent qu\u2019en 2011, Mme Young a re\u00e7u un montant de 3 634,20 $ \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration pour des heures suppl\u00e9mentaires. Bien qu\u2019il puisse s\u2019agir d\u2019une approximation imparfaite, l\u2019ann\u00e9e compl\u00e8te pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant le d\u00e9but des incidents d\u00e9crits dans la plainte de Mme Young servira de base \u00e0 mon calcul des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats. Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019accorderai \u00e0 Mme Young des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au titre de la perte d\u2019occasions de temps suppl\u00e9mentaire, selon les montants suivants :\n2 725,65 $ en 2012 (pour les \u00be de l\u2019ann\u00e9e);\n3 634,20 $ en 2013 (pour l\u2019ann\u00e9e enti\u00e8re);\npour un total de 6 359,85 $.\nPerte d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avancement\n[339] Mme Young a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 avoir perdu une possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avancement en raison de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019elle aurait obtenu une promotion si elle n\u2019avait pas port\u00e9 plainte contre M. Sawchuk.\n[340] Mme Young a int\u00e9gr\u00e9 dans ses observations finales une demande d\u2019indemnisation fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)c) pour :\nune perte de revenus futurs d\u2019un montant de 920 000 dollars li\u00e9e au fait que sa candidature pour un poste de gestion n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prise en consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 cause de sa plainte; la perte d\u2019une augmentation de salaire de 27 000 $ par ann\u00e9e sur une p\u00e9riode de 23 ans par suite de la discrimination qu\u2019on a laiss\u00e9e s\u2019aggraver, pour un montant total de 621 000 $ au titre de la perte de gains futurs.\n[341] Bien que Mme Young ait fourni certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur ce qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre la perte d\u2019une possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 des concours de dotation et sur sa relative anciennet\u00e9 ou exp\u00e9rience par rapport aux candidats retenus, je dispose de tr\u00e8s peu de t\u00e9moignages ou d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire \u00e0 l\u2019appui de ses all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles elle aurait eu le droit d\u2019\u00eatre prise en consid\u00e9ration pour une promotion, mais avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclue. La demande d\u2019indemnisation de Mme Young repose sur ses sp\u00e9culations quant aux raisons pour lesquelles elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans un bassin d\u2019embauche donn\u00e9 ni choisie pour un poste en particulier.\n[342] Je tiens \u00e9galement compte de la preuve attestant le fait que le CMT est un milieu de travail syndiqu\u00e9 et que Mme Young est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un syndicat. En l\u2019absence d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve clair concernant l\u2019occasion d\u2019emploi en question, les dispositions de la convention collective, le processus d\u2019embauche ou les facteurs susceptibles d\u2019avoir une incidence sur toute possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019emploi, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 conclure que Mme Young a perdu l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9senter sa candidature en vue d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019avancement ou qu\u2019elle a ainsi \u00e9t\u00e9 priv\u00e9e d\u2019un tel avancement.\n[343] Ni VIA ni la Commission n\u2019ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations \u00e0 ce sujet.\n[344] S\u2019il est vrai que la Loi habilite le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats relativement \u00e0 toute perte d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une conduite discriminatoire, y compris la perte d\u2019avancement, si un lien de causalit\u00e9 peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli entre la conduite discriminatoire et la perte r\u00e9clam\u00e9e, je ne suis pas convaincue, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience, que la conduite de M. Sawchuk est la raison pour laquelle Mme Young n\u2019a pas obtenu de promotion ou n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 incluse dans le bassin de candidats pour une quelconque occasion d\u2019emploi chez VIA.\n[345] Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal ne dispose pas d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suffisants pour accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats au titre de la perte de possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avancement.\n4. Co\u00fbts engag\u00e9s dans la poursuite de la plainte\n[346] La plaignante a largement document\u00e9 les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a engag\u00e9es au cours du long processus de pr\u00e9sentation de sa plainte devant le Tribunal. Elle a ainsi r\u00e9clam\u00e9 15 580 $ pour les frais d\u2019administration et de litige associ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de sa plainte par le Tribunal. (Bien que le total inclus dans les observations \u00e9crites de Mme Young ait \u00e9t\u00e9 de 158 805 $, je crois qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une erreur typographique, car les montants indiqu\u00e9s dans ses observations finales totalisent en fait 15 580 $.)\n[347] VIA a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention sur la d\u00e9cision Stanger c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2018 TCDP 14, aux paragraphes 43 \u00e0 45 [Stanger], pour faire valoir que la demande de la plaignante visant l\u2019adjudication des d\u00e9pens engag\u00e9s dans le cadre de la plainte ne rel\u00e8ve pas du pouvoir de r\u00e9paration conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal par l\u2019article 53.\n[348] La Commission ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur la question.\n[349] Dans l\u2019affaire Stanger, le Tribunal a statu\u00e9 comme suit :\n[43] Mme Stanger a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 divers re\u00e7us pour ce qu\u2019elle d\u00e9crit comme des \u00ab d\u00e9penses que la plaignante a engag\u00e9es pour pr\u00e9senter \u00bb sa plainte. Les re\u00e7us concernent des articles comme des photocopies, les frais de poste, les frais de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone cellulaire, des cartables, des onglets et du papier, ainsi que le stationnement et les repas pay\u00e9s lors de la comparution \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 Victoria.\n[44] Dans Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc. 2012 TCDP 20 (\u00ab Grant \u00bb), le Tribunal s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur une demande semblable au paragraphe 20 :\n[20] La plaignante sollicite une indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses qu\u2019elle a support\u00e9es dans le cadre de l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, et elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 un tableau de d\u00e9penses \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019audience du 10 juillet 2012. Elle sollicite la somme de 2 000 $ au titre de l\u2019h\u00e9bergement, des repas, du stationnement et des d\u00e9placements. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 [Mowat], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu qu\u2019il ressort clairement du texte, du contexte et de l\u2019objet de la Loi que le Tribunal n\u2019est pas habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 adjuger des d\u00e9pens. Selon le raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans cet arr\u00eat, et compte tenu du fait qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucun lien entre les types particuliers d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 d\u00e9crits \u00e0 l\u2019article 53 et les d\u00e9pens que r\u00e9clame la plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne puis voir dans la Loi une source quelconque qui autoriserait le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder une indemnit\u00e9 pour les d\u00e9penses support\u00e9es par la plaignante relativement \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la pr\u00e9sente affaire. De ce fait, aucune indemnit\u00e9 ne peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e pour ces d\u00e9pens.\n[45] Je suis d\u2019accord avec la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal dans Grant, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, qui se fonde sur le raisonnement de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Mowat, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, selon laquelle la Loi ne pr\u00e9voit pas le remboursement des co\u00fbts \u00ab administratifs \u00bb engag\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sentation de la plainte \u00e0 l\u2019audience et au pr\u00e9alable, en vertu de l\u2019article 53. Par cons\u00e9quent, je n\u2019accorde aucun montant pour les frais administratifs r\u00e9clam\u00e9s.\n[350] Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et il doit disposer de la latitude n\u00e9cessaire pour faire en sorte que les audiences tenues devant lui se d\u00e9roulent d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui favorise et prot\u00e8ge \u00e0 la fois l\u2019application r\u00e9guli\u00e8re de la loi et la dignit\u00e9 humaine. La Loi indique clairement que le TCDP n\u2019a pas le pouvoir d\u2019accorder des d\u00e9pens \u00e0 la partie ayant gain de cause, ainsi que le r\u00e9clame la plaignante (Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 (CanLII), Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 20 (CanLII) 2012 TCDP 20).\n[351] Le Tribunal est conscient des co\u00fbts extraordinaires (sur les plans humain et financier) que suppose une audience pour toutes les parties concern\u00e9es. Il reconna\u00eet aussi que l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de recouvrer les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s \u00e0 la participation \u00e0 une audience peut limiter la capacit\u00e9 des parties \u00e0 s\u2019engager pleinement dans le processus d\u2019audience. N\u00e9anmoins, le fait que le Tribunal reconnaisse ce manque \u00e0 gagner ne lui permet pas pour autant de concevoir une r\u00e9paration que la Loi ne l\u2019autorise pas \u00e0 concevoir.\n[352] S\u2019il est possible, dans certaines circonstances, d\u2019adjuger des d\u00e9pens r\u00e9sultant de la conduite des parties au cours d\u2019une audience devant le Tribunal, nous ne sommes pas en pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un tel cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Malgr\u00e9 ma conclusion selon laquelle elle a omis de pr\u00e9venir la conduite de M. Sawchuk et d\u2019y r\u00e9agir comme il se devait, et doit par cons\u00e9quent \u00eatre tenue responsable de cette conduite en vertu de la Loi, rien n\u2019indique que VIA n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal en toute bonne foi et coll\u00e9gialit\u00e9.\n[353] Je suis consciente du lourd fardeau qui p\u00e8se sur la personne qui d\u00e9pose une plainte en vue de faire respecter ses droits prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par la LCDP et, en fait, sur toutes les parties \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. Il ne m\u2019\u00e9chappe pas non plus que la plupart des Canadiens ordinaires n\u2019ont pas les ressources n\u00e9cessaires pour retenir les services d\u2019un avocat dans le cadre du processus ardu d\u2019une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Comme l\u2019illustrent les observations de Mme Young, les proc\u00e9dures en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne sont longues, complexes et co\u00fbteuses, m\u00eame si l\u2019on n\u2019a pas recours \u00e0 un avocat.\n[354] Cela dit, l\u2019analyse de la LCDP faite par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada ne laisse aucune place au d\u00e9bat dans un cas comme celui-ci. La Loi n\u2019autorise pas normalement le Tribunal \u00e0 accorder des d\u00e9pens (y compris les frais administratifs) \u00e0 la partie qui obtient gain de cause.\n[355] Par cons\u00e9quent, la demande de Mme Young visant les d\u00e9pens associ\u00e9s au d\u00e9p\u00f4t et \u00e0 la poursuite de sa plainte est rejet\u00e9e.\n5. Int\u00e9r\u00eats (par. 53(4) de la LCDP)\n[356] Comme l\u2019a r\u00e9clam\u00e9 la Commission dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, le Tribunal estime justifi\u00e9 d\u2019accorder, en vertu du paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP, des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur les indemnit\u00e9s \u00e0 compter de la date \u00e0 laquelle Mme Young a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\n[357] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 53(4) de la LCDP et au paragraphe 9(12) des R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal (03-05-04), la plaignante, Mme Young, a droit \u00e0 des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e, int\u00e9r\u00eats qui courent \u00e0 partir de la date du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte \u00e0 la Commission.\n[358] Toutefois, les int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s sur les montants accord\u00e9s au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 52(3) ne doivent en aucun cas porter le montant total des indemnit\u00e9s au\u2011del\u00e0 du montant maximal prescrit par ces m\u00eames dispositions (Chopra, au par. 53; citant Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2011 CSC 53 (CanLII), \u00e0 la p. 437).\n[359] Les int\u00e9r\u00eats seront calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle).\n6. Mesures de r\u00e9paration visant la politique (al. 53(2)a) de la LCDP)\n[360] Compte tenu de ma conclusion selon laquelle VIA ne s\u2019est pas acquitt\u00e9e de son obligation d\u2019examiner sans d\u00e9lai les all\u00e9gations de discrimination et d\u2019y donner suite rapidement, non plus qu\u2019elle n\u2019a men\u00e9 une enqu\u00eate rapide, approfondie et \u00e9quitable sur les all\u00e9gations soulev\u00e9es par Mme Young; et en ayant \u00e9galement \u00e0 l\u2019esprit le mandat, confi\u00e9 par la Loi au Tribunal, d\u2019emp\u00eacher que les comportements discriminatoires ne se reproduisent, j\u2019estime que la pr\u00e9sente affaire commande l\u2019exercice, par le Tribunal, de son pouvoir d\u2019ordonner des mesures de r\u00e9paration visant la politique, suivant l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)a) de la Loi, o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut lire :\n(2) \u00c0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction, le membre instructeur qui juge la plainte fond\u00e9e, peut, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019article 54, ordonner, selon les circonstances, \u00e0 la personne trouv\u00e9e coupable d\u2019un acte discriminatoire :\na) de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019acte et de prendre, en consultation avec la Commission relativement \u00e0 leurs objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux, des mesures de redressement ou des mesures destin\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9venir des actes semblables, notamment :\n(i) d\u2019adopter un programme, un plan ou un arrangement vis\u00e9s au paragraphe 16(1),\n(ii) de pr\u00e9senter une demande d\u2019approbation et de mettre en \u0153uvre un programme pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 17; [\u2026]\n[361] Les mesures de r\u00e9paration touchant la politique demand\u00e9es par la Commission sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de celle-ci, et comprennent notamment :\nune ordonnance exigeant de VIA qu\u2019elle travaille avec la Commission pour examiner et r\u00e9viser sa politique sur le harc\u00e8lement;\nune ordonnance exigeant que VIA, en consultation avec la Commission, retienne les services de personnes ind\u00e9pendantes et comp\u00e9tentes pour donner une formation en milieu de travail sur le harc\u00e8lement et la discrimination aux employ\u00e9s, y compris les gestionnaires, les superviseurs et les employ\u00e9s responsables de mener des enqu\u00eates sur le harc\u00e8lement en milieu de travail;\nune ordonnance exigeant de VIA qu\u2019elle informe tous les nouveaux employ\u00e9s de l\u2019existence de la politique sur le harc\u00e8lement et qu\u2019elle leur fournisse la formation n\u00e9cessaire;\nune ordonnance exigeant que VIA ait achev\u00e9, dans les six mois suivant la date de la d\u00e9cision rendue par le Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la mise en \u0153uvre de toutes les r\u00e9parations visant la politique r\u00e9clam\u00e9es.\n[362] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte l\u2019ensemble de la preuve, de la gravit\u00e9 de la conduite en cause et, surtout, de la nature d\u00e9licate, sur le plan de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, du travail des pr\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux locomotives, j\u2019estime qu\u2019il est appropri\u00e9, pour le Tribunal, de rendre des ordonnances de r\u00e9paration visant la politique qui serviront plusieurs fins. Ces ordonnances permettront de sensibiliser les employ\u00e9s du milieu de travail qui nous occupe en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce aux questions li\u00e9es au harc\u00e8lement et aux droits de la personne; d\u2019\u00e9laborer des proc\u00e9dures d\u2019enqu\u00eate et des formations appropri\u00e9es; et d\u2019instaurer un m\u00e9canisme de reddition de comptes gr\u00e2ce auquel VIA pourra v\u00e9rifier si les politiques, la formation et les proc\u00e9dures qu\u2019elle met en place ont l\u2019effet voulu, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire, si elles permettent d\u2019emp\u00eacher la discrimination et le harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9s sur une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Les ordonnances en question seront expos\u00e9es en d\u00e9tail plus loin, au paragraphe 369 des pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[363] La Commission a \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le Tribunal conserve sa comp\u00e9tence sur l\u2019affaire pour une p\u00e9riode de neuf mois \u00e0 compter de la date de ma pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision.\n[364] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de conserver sa comp\u00e9tence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019une question (voir Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et al. c.

Bien qu\u2019il ait le pouvoir de le faire, et qu\u2019il puisse effectivement \u00eatre appropri\u00e9 de le faire dans certains cas, le Tribunal ne dispose pas de ressources suffisantes, et n\u2019est pas structur\u00e9 de telle mani\u00e8re \u00e0 pouvoir superviser la mise en \u0153uvre de ses ordonnances dans la plupart des cas. Et, en temps normal, il est important que les parties puissent compter sur le caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des d\u00e9cisions et tourner la page sur les instances.\n[366] Cela dit, dans le contexte de la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision, je choisis, pour les deux raisons ci-apr\u00e8s, d\u2019exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 conserver ma comp\u00e9tence sur les r\u00e9parations que j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9es en ce qui concerne la politique :\nQue ce soit au cours de l\u2019audience ou dans ses observations finales, VIA n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune observation significative au sujet de mesures qu\u2019elle aurait prises, depuis le d\u00e9but de l\u2019instruction, pour rem\u00e9dier aux probl\u00e8mes soulev\u00e9s dans la plainte, ou pour porter \u00e0 l\u2019attention du Tribunal toute mesure susceptible de rendre redondantes ou contre-productives les ordonnances prononc\u00e9es ici.\nCompte tenu du temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis l\u2019audience, je souhaite donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019examiner d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles questions qui seraient apparues entre\u2011temps, et qui pourraient se rapporter aux ordonnances de r\u00e9paration touchant la politique.\n[367] Afin d\u2019\u00e9viter toute cons\u00e9quence n\u00e9gative impr\u00e9vue du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, je conserverai comp\u00e9tence pour une p\u00e9riode de six mois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ordonnances de r\u00e9paration visant la politique.\nV. D\u00e9cision [368] Pour tous les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, j\u2019accorde \u00e0 Mme Young :\nun montant de 12 000 $ au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du pr\u00e9judice moral subi par suite de la conduite discriminatoire de M.

APER\u00c7U [1] Les plaignants sont un groupe de pilotes retrait\u00e9s qui all\u00e8guent qu\u2019Air Canada et la Air Line Pilots Association, International (les \u00ab intim\u00e9es \u00bb) ont fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard en les obligeant \u00e0 prendre leur retraite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans en raison de la r\u00e8gle sur l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire fix\u00e9e par leur convention collective. La plupart des plaignants ont retenu les services d\u2019un avocat (la \u00ab coalition des plaignants \u00bb). Eric Rogers, Robert McBride, John Pinheiro, Patricia Clark (au nom de la succession de William Clark) et Stephen Collier agissent pour leur propre compte.\n[2] Les intim\u00e9es invoquent ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb), qui permettait aux employeurs de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi d\u2019une personne en raison de son \u00e2ge si celle-ci avait atteint \u00ab l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite en vigueur pour ce genre d\u2019emploi \u00bb. Subsidiairement, elles font valoir que la r\u00e8gle voulant que les pilotes prennent leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans constitue une exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e, et qu\u2019elles ne pouvaient composer avec ces derniers sans subir de contrainte excessive.\n[3] Pour d\u00e9cider si les intim\u00e9es peuvent invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e0 titre de moyen de d\u00e9fense relativement \u00e0 ce qui constituerait autrement de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, je dois d\u00e9terminer quelles sont les compagnies a\u00e9riennes qui peuvent \u00eatre retenues \u00e0 des fins de comparaison et qui employaient des pilotes dans des postes semblables \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019occupaient les plaignants au cours de la p\u00e9riode pertinente. J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019appliquer les facteurs retenus dans une instance ant\u00e9rieure \u2014 laquelle portait sur cette m\u00eame r\u00e8gle de retraite obligatoire applicable aux pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u2014 afin de recenser les compagnies a\u00e9riennes destin\u00e9es \u00e0 former le groupe de comparaison (Nedelec et al. c. Air Canada et Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2022 TCDP 30 (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs \u00bb)).\n[4] Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, j\u2019ai conclu que, pour \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison pour la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2010 au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012 (date \u00e0 laquelle le dernier des pilotes vis\u00e9s dans l\u2019affaire Nedelec a atteint l\u2019\u00e2ge de 60 ans), les compagnies a\u00e9riennes devaient satisfaire \u00e0 l\u2019ensemble des facteurs \u00e9tablis dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven c. Air Canada, 2009 CF 367 (les \u00ab facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF \u00bb) :\nElles exploitent des a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses;\nElles exploitent des a\u00e9ronefs de types divers;\nElles transportent des voyageurs vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures;\nElles transportent des voyageurs vers des destinations internationales;\nElles traversent l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger;\nElles transportent des passagers.\n(D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs, au par. 40)\n[5] Les intim\u00e9es soutiennent que les plaintes devraient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es, car Air Canada employait plus de pilotes que toutes les compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es. Autrement dit, les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada constituent le groupe dominant et d\u00e9finissent donc l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite pour les employ\u00e9s occupant des postes semblables \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019occupaient les plaignants.\n[6] La coalition de plaignants n\u2019est pas en d\u00e9saccord avec les intim\u00e9es. Elle convient que l\u2019issue des plaintes est in\u00e9vitable \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs qu\u2019a rendue le Tribunal et des donn\u00e9es fournies par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes quant au nombre de pilotes qu\u2019elles employaient. Les autres plaignants n\u2019ont rien d\u00e9pos\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande des intim\u00e9es de rejeter les plaintes.\n[7] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure depuis que j\u2019ai pris en charge ces dossiers en 2021, si ce n\u2019est que pour assister aux conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires.\nII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [8] Il reste deux questions \u00e0 trancher pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite des employ\u00e9s occupant des postes semblables \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019occupaient les plaignants et pour d\u00e9cider si les intim\u00e9es peuvent invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) :\n(i)Quelles sont les compagnies a\u00e9riennes qui respectent les autres facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF et qui devraient \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison?\n(ii)Air Canada employait-elle la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es?\nIII. D\u00c9CISION [9] L\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite pour les employ\u00e9s occupant des postes semblables \u00e0 ceux qu\u2019occupaient les plaignants est 60 ans, l\u2019\u00e2ge auquel ces derniers ont pris leur retraite. Air Canada employait plus de pilotes que toutes les compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es. Les intim\u00e9es peuvent invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) \u00e0 titre de moyen de d\u00e9fense, et les plaintes sont rejet\u00e9es. Les plaignants n\u2019ont pas prouv\u00e9 que la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire constituait un acte discriminatoire.\nIV. QUESTION PR\u00c9LIMINAIRE [10] Robert McBride, un des plaignants, a \u00e9crit au Tribunal le 2 juin 2023 pour l\u2019aviser que l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada n\u2019existait plus et que les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada \u00e9taient d\u00e9sormais repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par une autre association. Il a soulev\u00e9 un certain nombre de pr\u00e9occupations concernant ce changement, notamment le fait qu\u2019il y a eu d\u2019autres changements d\u2019avocats, de repr\u00e9sentants et de pr\u00e9sident au cours de cette longue proc\u00e9dure. Il se demandait \u00e9galement si la Commission et le Tribunal en avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s.\n[11] Les avocats de l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada ont r\u00e9pondu que la Air Line Pilots Association, International (la \u00ab ALPA \u00bb) et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada avaient conclu un accord de fusion le 17 mai 2023. Selon les modalit\u00e9s de cet accord, la ALPA est le syndicat successeur de l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada et peut \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure. Le Tribunal modifiera l\u2019intitul\u00e9 de la cause en cons\u00e9quence.\n[12] Le Tribunal confirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 avis\u00e9 de ce changement au moyen d\u2019une lettre de M. McBride et des avocats de la ALPA. Il n\u2019y a eu aucune communication ex parte avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la ALPA ou toute autre partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance. Autrement dit, le Tribunal n\u2019a communiqu\u00e9 avec aucune partie sans que les autres parties ne soient consult\u00e9es ou ne le sachent.\nV. CONTEXTE \u2014 D\u00c9CISIONS SUR REQU\u00caTE ANT\u00c9RIEURES ET M\u00c9THODE [13] J\u2019ai bri\u00e8vement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les mesures prises en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce afin d\u2019expliquer pourquoi je rejette les plaintes.\n[14] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs, j\u2019ai \u00e9tabli une d\u00e9marche en deux \u00e9tapes pour identifier les compagnies a\u00e9riennes destin\u00e9es \u00e0 former le groupe de comparaison, d\u00e9marche qui commence par une analyse des deux premiers facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF, \u00e0 savoir si les compagnies a\u00e9riennes exploitent des a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses et si elles exploitent des a\u00e9ronefs de types divers.\n[15] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u les observations des parties, j\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que 21 compagnies a\u00e9riennes exploitaient des a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses et de types divers et qu\u2019elles passaient \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape suivante de l\u2019analyse visant \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si elles devaient \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison (Nedelec et al. c. Air Canada et Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2022 TCDP 40, au par. 25 [la \u00ab d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la taille et au type \u00bb]).\n[16] J\u2019ai ensuite collabor\u00e9 avec les parties participant \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance pour trouver un moyen \u00e9quitable et efficace de d\u00e9terminer quelles compagnies a\u00e9riennes respectaient les autres facteurs, \u00e0 savoir le fait de transporter des voyageurs vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales, de traverser l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger et de transporter des passagers.\n[17] Les parties ont convenu qu\u2019un questionnaire serait envoy\u00e9 aux compagnies a\u00e9riennes en m\u00eame temps que les assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Air Canada a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 le questionnaire et toutes les parties ont eu la possibilit\u00e9 de le passer en revue et de le commenter. Elles se sont entendues sur le libell\u00e9 des questions visant \u00e0 savoir combien de pilotes les compagnies a\u00e9riennes employaient au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es et si elles effectuaient des vols internationaux, y compris aux \u00c9tats-Unis, et\/ou si elles \u00e9taient dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 fournir des devis et \u00e0 offrir un service d\u2019affr\u00e8tement international sur demande \u00e0 destination ou en provenance de n\u2019importe o\u00f9 dans le monde, y compris les \u00c9tats-Unis. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9livr\u00e9 les assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre et Air Canada les a signifi\u00e9es \u00e0 toutes les compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison.\n[18] Les destinataires de ces assignations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9s que s\u2019ils r\u00e9pondaient aux questions et fournissaient les documents n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019appui de leurs r\u00e9ponses, ils pourraient ne pas \u00eatre tenus de se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Toutes les parties ont convenu qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de la fa\u00e7on la plus efficace et la plus rapide de recueillir les donn\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer quelles compagnies a\u00e9riennes devaient former le groupe de comparaison. Le Tribunal a pr\u00e9vu des jours d\u2019audience pour donner aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de contester les r\u00e9ponses re\u00e7ues et de poser des questions aux repr\u00e9sentants des compagnies a\u00e9riennes, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[19] Dix-neuf compagnies a\u00e9riennes ont fourni une r\u00e9ponse compl\u00e8te au questionnaire. Une compagnie a\u00e9rienne a fourni une r\u00e9ponse partielle et une autre n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu. Air Canada a compil\u00e9 les donn\u00e9es re\u00e7ues et les a communiqu\u00e9es sous forme de tableau sommaire avant que n\u2019ait lieu la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire suivante. Les parties ont donc eu l\u2019occasion d\u2019examiner les donn\u00e9es avant la conf\u00e9rence.\n[20] Au cours de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux plaignants ce qu\u2019ils pensaient des donn\u00e9es re\u00e7ues. La coalition de plaignants a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en mesure de contester l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des r\u00e9ponses re\u00e7ues. Elle a aussi reconnu qu\u2019il \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable que les plaintes soient rejet\u00e9es compte tenu de la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs et du nombre de pilotes employ\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison par rapport \u00e0 tous les pilotes employ\u00e9s par Air Canada. Les autres plaignants \u00e9taient du m\u00eame avis et n\u2019ont pas contest\u00e9 le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses fourni par Air Canada ni la pr\u00e9sentation qu\u2019elle a faite des donn\u00e9es. Ils \u00e9taient \u00e9galement d\u2019accord avec ce que la coalition de plaignants avait dit \u00e0 propos de l\u2019issue des plaintes. Les dates d\u2019audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9es avec l\u2019accord de toutes les parties, et Air Canada a laiss\u00e9 les t\u00e9moins savoir que leur pr\u00e9sence n\u2019\u00e9tait plus requise.\nA. La requ\u00eate en suspension de l\u2019instance d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la coalition des plaignants [21] Au cours de la m\u00eame conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, la coalition de plaignants m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de suspendre l\u2019instance le temps que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale statue sur sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs du Tribunal, ce que j\u2019ai refus\u00e9. \u00c0 mon avis, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice ne justifiait pas de retarder le processus d\u2019instruction pendant une p\u00e9riode ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e. De m\u00eame, je n\u2019ai pas jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public de suspendre l\u2019instruction des plaintes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une cour de justice se prononce sur une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate provisoire.\n[22] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les plaignants ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019issue de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable, j\u2019ai \u00e9galement fix\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais pour que les intim\u00e9es pr\u00e9sentent de br\u00e8ves observations et expliquent pourquoi elles estiment, sur la base des donn\u00e9es re\u00e7ues, que les plaintes n\u2019ont aucune chance d\u2019\u00eatre accueillies et qu\u2019elles doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es. J\u2019ai donn\u00e9 aux plaignants la possibilit\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre et j\u2019ai fix\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations en r\u00e9plique, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant.\n[23] La coalition de plaignants \u00e9tait d\u2019accord avec les intim\u00e9es pour dire que les plaintes devaient \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es si la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs \u00e9tait appliqu\u00e9e aux donn\u00e9es fournies par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes dans le questionnaire. Or, elle a r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire ajourner le prononc\u00e9 de la d\u00e9cision finale jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019issue du contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs au motif que, si cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u00e9tait infirm\u00e9e, les plaignants devraient alors aussi demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision finale. Dans des observations dat\u00e9es du 24 mai 2023, elle indique que la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale examinera la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019ici quelques semaines \u00bb seulement.\n[24] Je ne suis pas convaincu que je doive revenir sur ma d\u00e9cision de rejeter la requ\u00eate en suspension de l\u2019instance. La coalition de plaignants aurait pu attendre la fin de la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure pour d\u00e9poser une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire, d\u2019autant plus que la liste des compagnies a\u00e9riennes destin\u00e9es \u00e0 former le groupe de comparaison n\u2019avait pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie lorsque j\u2019ai rendu la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs et que les compagnies a\u00e9riennes n\u2019avaient pas encore fourni de donn\u00e9es sur le nombre total de pilotes qu\u2019elles employaient. Le fait qu\u2019elle ait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de demander le contr\u00f4le judiciaire d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate provisoire ne constitue pas un motif suffisant pour suspendre l\u2019instance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la conclusion du contr\u00f4le judiciaire et du processus d\u2019appel. L\u2019audition de la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire est pr\u00e9vue pour juillet 2023, mais il faudra attendre bien plus longtemps pour qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision soit rendue ou pour qu\u2019un appel soit interjet\u00e9.\nB. Il est juste et efficace d\u2019abr\u00e9ger le processus d\u2019instruction [25] Dans le cadre de ces plaintes de longue date, je rends une d\u00e9cision finale en suivant un processus abr\u00e9g\u00e9 et sans tenir d\u2019audience. J\u2019ai accept\u00e9 les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de la preuve non contest\u00e9e qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par les avocats en vertu des pouvoirs qui me sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la Loi et j\u2019ai collabor\u00e9 avec les parties participant \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance afin de faire progresser l\u2019affaire rapidement et efficacement. J\u2019ai obtenu le consentement des parties pour proc\u00e9der ainsi, apr\u00e8s leur avoir donn\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de contester la preuve et d\u2019interroger les t\u00e9moins. Les parties et le Tribunal ont ainsi \u00e9conomis\u00e9 le temps et les frais aff\u00e9rents \u00e0 l\u2019assignation formelle des t\u00e9moins et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation d\u2019une preuve par affidavit.\n[26] J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de proc\u00e9der ainsi parce que les parties ont reconnu qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait aucun avantage \u00e0 tenir une audience compl\u00e8te compte tenu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve connus \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque et des d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment rendues par le Tribunal. Les parties avaient d\u00e9j\u00e0 pass\u00e9 beaucoup de temps \u00e0 d\u00e9battre de la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der dans ces affaires, comme en t\u00e9moignent la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs et la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la taille et au type. La coalition de plaignants a aussi demand\u00e9 le contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs, ce qui montre que la m\u00e9thode adopt\u00e9e par le Tribunal \u00e9tait, aux yeux des parties, le point le plus litigieux et le plus important \u00e0 trancher en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. \u00c0 mon avis, le fait de proc\u00e9der de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive et abr\u00e9g\u00e9e pour rendre une d\u00e9cision finale dans le contexte de ces plaintes est proportionnel \u00e0 l\u2019importance des questions qui demeurent en litige et permet au Tribunal de respecter son obligation l\u00e9gale d\u2019instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (al. 48.9(1) de la Loi).\nVI. MOTIFS (i) Quelles sont les compagnies a\u00e9riennes qui respectent les autres facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF et qui devraient \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison? [27] J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de me fier aux donn\u00e9es non contest\u00e9es qu\u2019Air Canada a fournies relativement aux autres facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF, m\u00eame si elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re habituelle. Aucune partie n\u2019a manifest\u00e9 l\u2019intention de les contester ou de mettre en doute leur exactitude.\n[28] Parmi les 19 compagnies a\u00e9riennes qui ont r\u00e9pondu au questionnaire, les compagnies suivantes respectent tous les autres facteurs et forment le groupe de comparaison aux fins de la d\u00e9termination de l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es :\nAir North\nAir Tindi\nCalm Air\nCanadian North\nEnerjet\nFirst Air\nJazz\nMorningstar Air Express\nNolinor\nNorth Cariboo\nProvincial Airlines\nVoyageur Airways\nWasaya\n[29] Selon Air Canada, six des compagnies a\u00e9riennes ne devraient pas \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison parce qu\u2019elles ne respectent pas tous les autres facteurs. Les autres parties ne contestent pas ces observations, et je les accepte au vu des donn\u00e9es re\u00e7ues, lesquelles parlent d\u2019elles-m\u00eames.\n[30] Flair Airlines a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019exploitait pas d\u2019a\u00e9ronefs de tailles diverses et de types divers au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019exploitait que trois Boeing 737-400. D\u2019autres a\u00e9ronefs figurent dans le Registre d\u2019immatriculation des a\u00e9ronefs civils canadiens, mais Flair Airlines a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient utilis\u00e9s uniquement \u00e0 des fins personnelles et qu\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas exploit\u00e9s dans le cadre de ses activit\u00e9s commerciales.\n[31] Air Creebec, Air Inuit, Buffalo Airways, Central Mountain Air et Kelowna Fightcraft ne devraient pas non plus \u00eatre incluses dans le groupe de comparaison. Elles ne transportaient pas de passagers vers des destinations int\u00e9rieures et internationales et ne traversaient pas l\u2019espace a\u00e9rien canadien et \u00e9tranger pendant les p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, pendant ces m\u00eames p\u00e9riodes, elles n\u2019effectuaient pas de vols internationaux et elles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas dispos\u00e9es \u00e0 fournir des devis et \u00e0 offrir un service d\u2019affr\u00e8tement international sur demande \u00e0 destination ou en provenance de n\u2019importe o\u00f9 dans le monde, y compris les \u00c9tats-Unis.\n(ii) Air Canada employait-elle la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es? [32] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux facteurs, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois que le Tribunal aurait confirm\u00e9 le groupe de comparaison et le nombre de pilotes employ\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes, il ne serait peut-\u00eatre pas n\u00e9cessaire de poursuivre l\u2019instance. Autrement dit, si Air Canada employait alors plus de pilotes que toutes les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison, le Tribunal pourrait rejeter les plaintes.\n[33] J\u2019applique l\u2019analyse statistique \u00e9labor\u00e9e dans la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF (appliqu\u00e9e dans Thwaites et al. c. Air Canada et l\u2019Association des pilotes d\u2019Air Canada, 2011 TCDP 11 [Thwaites], confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans Adamson c. Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne), 2015 CAF 153.\n[34] J\u2019ai pris en compte toute la p\u00e9riode pendant laquelle les plaignants ont pris leur retraite. Air Canada a divis\u00e9 la p\u00e9riode s\u2019\u00e9chelonnant du 1er janvier 2010 au 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012 en cinq sous-p\u00e9riodes dont les dates de d\u00e9but et de fin correspondent \u00e0 des moments o\u00f9 les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison ont apport\u00e9 des changements \u00e0 la preuve. Dans une annexe \u00e0 ses observations, Air Canada a aussi fourni les nombres maximums et minimums de pilotes employ\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison et a indiqu\u00e9 le nombre de pilotes qu\u2019elle employait au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es.\n[35] Je suis pr\u00eat \u00e0 accepter ces donn\u00e9es non contest\u00e9es, r\u00e9sum\u00e9es par Air Canada et expos\u00e9es ci-dessous. Aucune partie ne les a contest\u00e9es ou n\u2019a mis en doute leur exactitude, et toutes ont renonc\u00e9 \u00e0 leur droit d\u2019interroger ou de contre-interroger les t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes. Dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 ci-dessous, le nombre de pilotes employ\u00e9s par Air Canada est compar\u00e9 au nombre de pilotes employ\u00e9s par les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison. On y trouve \u00e9galement le pourcentage du nombre total de pilotes que repr\u00e9sentent les employ\u00e9s d\u2019Air Canada. Dans le cas des compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison, le tableau fait \u00e9tat des nombres les plus bas et les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s de pilotes employ\u00e9s au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n1er janvier \u2014 30 juin 2010 :\nAir Canada : 3 083 pilotes\nCompagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison : 2 116,3 \u00e0 2 121,3 pilotes\nNombre total de pilotes : 5 199,3 \u00e0 5 206,3\nAir Canada employait entre 59,22 % et 59,3 % de tous les pilotes.\n1er juillet \u2014 31 d\u00e9cembre 2010 :\nAir Canada : 3 028 pilotes\nCompagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison : 2 188,3 \u00e0 2 198,3 pilotes\nNombre total de pilotes : 5 216,3 \u00e0 5 226,3\nAir Canada employait entre 57,94 % et 58,05 % de tous les pilotes.\n1er janvier \u2014 30 juin 2011 :\nAir Canada : 3 011 pilotes\nCompagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison : 2 269,2 \u00e0 2 295,2 pilotes\nNombre total de pilotes : 5 280,2 \u00e0 5 306,2\nAir Canada employait entre 56,74 % et 57,02 % de tous les pilotes.\n1er juillet \u2014 31 d\u00e9cembre 2011 :\nAir Canada : 3 024 pilotes\nCompagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison : 2 475,2 \u00e0 2 479,2 pilotes\nNombre total de pilotes : 5 499,2 \u00e0 5 503,2\nAir Canada employait entre 54,99 % et 54,95 % de tous les pilotes.\n1er janvier \u2014 28 f\u00e9vrier 2012 :\nAir Canada : 3 021 pilotes\nCompagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison : 2 447 pilotes\nNombre total de pilotes : 5 468.\nAir Canada employait 55,25 % de tous les pilotes.\n[36] La ALPA a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le tableau d\u2019Air Canada, les compagnies a\u00e9riennes \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9es comptaient entre 2 349 et 2 726 pilotes, m\u00eame en incluant les compagnies qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas respecter les facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF et en prenant en consid\u00e9ration les nombres les plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s. Air Canada employait quant \u00e0 elle entre 3 011 et 3 083 pilotes pour toutes les p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es \u2014 ces donn\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par les avocats d\u2019Air Canada lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire, elles n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9es et elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 tenues pour av\u00e9r\u00e9es. Autrement dit, m\u00eame sans \u00e9carter les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ne pas respecter les facteurs de la d\u00e9cision Vilven CF et en prenant en consid\u00e9ration le nombre le plus \u00e9lev\u00e9 de pilotes de toutes ces compagnies, Air Canada employait tout de m\u00eame plus de pilotes que les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison au cours de chacune des p\u00e9riodes.\n[37] Les plaignants ont \u00e9galement convenu lors de la derni\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire que les deux compagnies a\u00e9riennes qui n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9pondu au questionnaire, en totalit\u00e9 ou en partie (Kelowna Flightcraft et Regional 1), n\u2019auraient pas employ\u00e9 suffisamment de pilotes pour faire une diff\u00e9rence ou pour faire pencher la balance en faveur des compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison.\n[38] L\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite est l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite de la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes du groupe repr\u00e9sentatif global d\u2019employ\u00e9s occupant des postes similaires (Nedelec c. Rogers, 2021 CF 191 aux par. 33-35). Comme le soutient la ALPA, l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite est donc toujours d\u00e9fini par les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada en tant que groupe dominant.\n[39] Je suis donc persuad\u00e9 que, pour les p\u00e9riodes susmentionn\u00e9es, l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite \u00e9tait de 60 ans. Les pilotes d\u2019Air Canada repr\u00e9sentent la majorit\u00e9 de l\u2019ensemble des pilotes employ\u00e9s. J\u2019accepte les arguments d\u2019Air Canada selon lesquels cette conclusion est valable m\u00eame si je pr\u00e9sume, sans toutefois me prononcer sur la question, que l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite des pilotes de toutes les compagnies a\u00e9riennes du groupe de comparaison n\u2019\u00e9tait pas 60 ans. En d\u2019autres termes, comme Air Canada employait la majorit\u00e9 des pilotes au cours des p\u00e9riodes vis\u00e9es, quel que soit l\u2019\u00e2ge r\u00e9el de la retraite des pilotes des compagnies a\u00e9riennes incluses dans le groupe de comparaison, l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite \u00e9tait de 60 ans pour ces p\u00e9riodes puisqu\u2019il s\u2019agissait de l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire d\u2019Air Canada. Le Tribunal a suivi ce m\u00eame raisonnement ou cette m\u00eame approche aux paragraphes 181 et 182 de la d\u00e9cision Thwaites.\n[40] Les intim\u00e9es peuvent donc invoquer l\u2019alin\u00e9a 15(1)c) de la Loi, tel qu\u2019il existait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Elles ont pu exiger que les pilotes prennent leur retraite \u00e0 60 ans parce que l\u2019\u00e2ge normal de la retraite \u00e9tait de 60 ans. La r\u00e8gle sur l\u2019\u00e2ge de la retraite obligatoire des intim\u00e9es ne constitue pas un acte discriminatoire au sens de la Loi.\nVII.

Amir Attaran est n\u00e9 aux \u00c9tats-Unis de parents immigrants iraniens. Il a d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 au Canada alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait adulte. En 2009, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de parrainage pour que ses parents viennent au Canada. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, le gouvernement canadien prenait beaucoup plus de temps pour traiter les demandes d\u2019immigration relatives aux \u00ab parents et grands-parents \u00bb que pour traiter celles dans les autres groupes de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial, tels que les \u00e9poux et les enfants. Dans sa plainte, M. Attaran a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge, la situation de famille, la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique.\nBien que la demande de M. Attaran pour le parrainage de ses parents ait finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e et que le processus relatif au parrainage de parents et grands-parents ait chang\u00e9 depuis 2009, sa plainte demeurait non r\u00e9solue. Le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) a d\u2019abord confirm\u00e9 que les parents de M. Attaran poss\u00e9daient des caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP), notamment la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la situation de famille et l\u2019\u00e2ge. Ensuite, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 si les mesures gouvernementales particuli\u00e8res ayant contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 allonger les d\u00e9lais de traitement pour la cat\u00e9gorie des parents et grands-parents constituaient un \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu de la LCDP.\nM. Attaran a contest\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont Immigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada a mis en \u0153uvre les \u00ab plans de niveaux \u00bb. Ces plans sont des projections du nombre de personnes qui seront accueillies au Canada chaque ann\u00e9e, ventil\u00e9es par cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019immigrants.\nM. Attaran a \u00e9galement contest\u00e9 les instructions minist\u00e9rielles. Le Tribunal a conclu que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme un service en vertu de la LCDP.\nL\u2019autre all\u00e9gation concernait le fait que le ministre n\u2019avait pas exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir d\u2019exempter de tout r\u00e8glement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration les r\u00e9pondants et les demandeurs de la cat\u00e9gorie des parents et grands-parents, ce qui pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur un motif illicite en vertu de la LCDP. Le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que cette all\u00e9gation constituait essentiellement une attaque contre les r\u00e8glements en cause. M. Attaran et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements est un service et ont express\u00e9ment sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal de ne pas se prononcer sur cette question.\nLa plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e parce que M. Attaran n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 prouver les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de l\u2019affaire. Il a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le traitement \u00e9tait diff\u00e9rent et que les demandes relatives aux parents et grands-parents \u00e9taient trait\u00e9es plus lentement que celles des autres cat\u00e9gories, mais il n\u2019a pas prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019Immigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire. Pour chaque all\u00e9gation mentionn\u00e9e ci-dessus, soit aucun traitement d\u00e9favorable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9, soit le traitement d\u00e9favorable all\u00e9gu\u00e9 s\u2019expliquait par une raison qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant un \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCitation : 2023 TCDP\n27\nDate d\u2019entr\u00e9e en vigueur :\nLe 4 juillet 2023\nNum\u00e9ro de dossier :\nT2163\/3716\nEntre :\nAmir Attaran\nle plaignant\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nImmigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada (anciennement Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada)\nl\u2019intim\u00e9\n- et -\nChinese and South Asian Law Clinic\nla partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e\nD\u00e9cision sur le fond\nMembre :\nDavid L.

L\u2019ENQU\u00caTE [1] Il s\u2019agit de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond d\u2019une enqu\u00eate devant le Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb ou TCDP) relativement \u00e0 une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e il y a plus de dix ans. Le Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de l\u2019affaire pendant plus de six ans, l\u2019audience a dur\u00e9 22 jours et les observations \u00e9crites approfondies ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es sur une p\u00e9riode de 13 mois en 2021 et 2022.\n[2] Cette enqu\u00eate concernait la plainte de M. Amir Attaran (le \u00ab plaignant \u00bb) contre Immigration, R\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et Citoyennet\u00e9 Canada (IRCC, anciennement Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada ou CIC) d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (CCDP ou la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 28 juillet 2010. Le plaignant all\u00e8gue que des pratiques discriminatoires de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont contribu\u00e9 au retard important dans le traitement de sa demande de parrainage de ses parents en vue de leur immigration, ainsi qu\u2019au retard dans le traitement des demandes d\u2019autres demandeurs similaires, par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigration dans la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial (au sens du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, ch. 27 [LIPR]), en contravention de l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la LCDP ou la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[3] Les motifs de discrimination illicites all\u00e9gu\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019origine \u00e9taient l\u2019\u00e2ge et la situation de famille. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate \u00e9crite, j\u2019ai \u00e9galement autoris\u00e9 M. Attaran \u00e0 modifier sa plainte pour y ajouter la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique en tant que motifs de discrimination illicites (voir 2017 CHRT 21).\n[4] Dans un premier temps, la Commission a refus\u00e9 de renvoyer la plainte de M. Attaran au Tribunal pour enqu\u00eate. La Commission a rejet\u00e9 la plainte de M. Attaran au motif que, bien qu\u2019il semblait qu\u2019IRCC avait trait\u00e9 les demandes pour les parents et les grands-parents diff\u00e9remment des demandes de parrainage pour les \u00e9poux et les enfants \u00e0 charge, elle \u00e9tait convaincue qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait du r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019exercice d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel et que le plaignant n\u2019avait pas directement contest\u00e9 le pouvoir du ministre d\u2019exercer un tel pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[5] M. Attaran a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond de la Commission. La Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a rejet\u00e9 la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de M. Attaran. M. Attaran a fait appel de la d\u00e9cision aupr\u00e8s de la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale qui, dans sa d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9e du 3 f\u00e9vrier 2015, a annul\u00e9 la conclusion de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et a renvoy\u00e9 l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Commission (2015 CAF 37).\n[6] La Commission a finalement renvoy\u00e9 la plainte de M. Attaran au Tribunal, qui l\u2019a re\u00e7ue le 7 septembre 2016. La gestion de l\u2019affaire devant le Tribunal a dur\u00e9 longtemps. De nombreuses questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9es concernant la communication de documents. Plusieurs milliers de documents ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s par IRCC \u00e0 M. Attaran dans le cadre du processus de communication. Au cours de la p\u00e9riode pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019audience, 15 conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires (CTP) ont eu lieu et j\u2019ai r\u00e9dig\u00e9 quatre d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 des requ\u00eates interlocutoires \u00e9crites.\n[7] En ao\u00fbt 2017, la Chinese and South Asian Law Clinic (CSALC) de Toronto a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pour \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e en tant que partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 cette plainte. La CSALC est un organisme \u00e0 but non lucratif constitu\u00e9 en vertu des lois de l\u2019Ontario. Elle fournit des services juridiques gratuits aux membres des communaut\u00e9s chinoise, vietnamienne, cambodgienne et laotienne vivant en Ontario qui ne parlent pas l\u2019anglais et dont les revenus sont faibles, et elle agit en tant que groupe de d\u00e9fense des int\u00e9r\u00eats de ces personnes. La CSALC est \u00e9galement impliqu\u00e9e dans la r\u00e9forme du droit et a comparu devant le Comit\u00e9 permanent de la citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019immigration du Parlement pour pr\u00e9senter des observations sur divers sujets, notamment le regroupement familial et les demandes de parrainage au titre de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial. La CSALC participe \u00e9galement de temps \u00e0 autre \u00e0 des litiges portant sur des cas types. J\u2019ai conclu que le CSALC poss\u00e9dait une expertise susceptible d\u2019aider le Tribunal dans cette affaire. Son acceptation en tant que partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 limit\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment aux souhaits exprim\u00e9s par le plaignant (voir 2018 CHRT 6).\n[8] Malheureusement, la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19 a retard\u00e9 le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, qui devait initialement commencer en personne \u00e0 Ottawa en avril 2020. Finalement, l\u2019audience a commenc\u00e9 en ligne en f\u00e9vrier 2021, au moyen de la plateforme de t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence Zoom. Il y a eu deux interruptions impr\u00e9vues de l\u2019audience (dont il est question ci-dessous), ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 la reprogrammation des jours d\u2019audience en avril et en septembre 2021. Les plaidoiries finales devaient \u00eatre entendues au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2022. Cependant, le plaignant a demand\u00e9 l\u2019annulation de l\u2019audition pour des raisons personnelles, et j\u2019ai approuv\u00e9 cette demande apr\u00e8s consultation des autres parties. Au total, il y a eu 22 jours d\u2019audience, en plus des arguments finaux \u00e9crits, puis d\u2019autres observations \u00e9crites \u00e0 la place des arguments finaux oraux.\nII. DISPOSITION [9] Pour les raisons qui suivent, j\u2019ai conclu que la plainte du plaignant et de la Commission n\u2019\u00e9tait pas fond\u00e9e. Ils n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie qui d\u00e9montre un traitement d\u00e9favorable dans la fourniture d\u2019un service par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nIII. LES PARTIES [10] Le plaignant, M. Amir Attaran, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre n\u00e9 et avoir grandi en Californie, seul enfant de parents ayant immigr\u00e9 d\u2019Iran. Il est titulaire d\u2019un baccalaur\u00e9at en neurosciences de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Californie \u00e0 Berkeley et d\u2019une ma\u00eetrise \u00e8s sciences en biologie du California Institute of Technology (Caltech) \u00e0 Pasadena. M. Attaran a ensuite obtenu un doctorat dans une discipline li\u00e9e \u00e0 la biologie de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Oxford, en Angleterre, et un baccalaur\u00e9at en droit de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Colombie-Britannique. Avant de devenir professeur \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 d\u2019Ottawa, M. Attaran a occup\u00e9 des postes universitaires \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Harvard et \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Yale, \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de droit et \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de m\u00e9decine.\n[11] Les avocats de la Commission ont chang\u00e9 au cours de la longue p\u00e9riode de gestion du dossier. Ma\u00eetre Daniel Poulin, avocat de longue date de la CCDP, a pris sa retraite avant la tenue de l\u2019audience. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9 par Mme Caroline Carrasco, qui \u00e9tait bas\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger pour les premi\u00e8res parties de l\u2019audience. Au m\u00eame moment, le plaignant se trouvait en Californie avec ses parents, ce qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un d\u00e9calage horaire de dix heures parmi toutes les parties. Malgr\u00e9 la grande distance, la plateforme en ligne nous a permis de terminer de nombreux jours d\u2019audience et le Tribunal remercie Mme Carrasco d\u2019avoir tenu des horaires aussi tardifs pendant cette phase. La Commission a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 habilement repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Mme Sasha Hart tout au long des parties pr\u00e9liminaires et des preuves de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement chang\u00e9 d\u2019avocats au cours de la phase pr\u00e9paratoire \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Korinda McLaine et Abigail Martinez, du minist\u00e8re de la Justice, repr\u00e9sentaient initialement l\u2019intim\u00e9. Au cours de la phase de gestion d\u2019instance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant l\u2019audience, elles ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 remplac\u00e9es par leurs coll\u00e8gues, Sean Stynes et Kelly Keenan, qui \u00e9taient \u00e9galement appuy\u00e9s par une autre avocate, Susan Wladysiuk, et une assistante juridique, Courtney Hughes.\n[13] La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, la Chinese and Southeast Asian Legal Clinic, \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par Jin Chien et Ada Chan.\nIV. LA PLAINTE [14] Selon son formulaire de plainte original, M. Attaran a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re partie de sa demande (la \u00ab partie 1 \u00bb) pour parrainer ses parents aux fins d\u2019immigration en juillet 2009. Lorsqu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP, il a not\u00e9 que le site Web de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indiquait qu\u2019IRCC achevait le traitement des demandes de parrainage de parents et de grands-parents (PGP) de la partie 1 environ 37 mois apr\u00e8s leur r\u00e9ception. En revanche, le m\u00eame site Web indiquait qu\u2019IRCC traitait les demandes de parrainage pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la partie 1 pour les \u00e9poux, les conjoints de fait ou les partenaires conjugaux, les enfants \u00e0 charge et certains autres parents (FC1) en environ 42 jours (voir pi\u00e8ce 1).\n[15] IRCC a finalement approuv\u00e9 la demande de M. Attaran et ses parents sont arriv\u00e9s au Canada en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents il y a environ dix ans. M. Attaran all\u00e8gue toutefois de multiples pratiques discriminatoires impliquant une discrimination syst\u00e9mique, au nom de tous les parrains et de leurs parents ou grands-parents, dans la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial qui sont [Traduction] \u00ab dans une situation similaire \u00bb \u00e0 celle dans laquelle il se trouvait lorsqu\u2019il a parrain\u00e9 ses parents (m\u00e9moire du plaignant aux paragraphes 3 et 5). \u00c0 ce titre, il demande des r\u00e9parations syst\u00e9miques et personnelles pour la discrimination qu\u2019il all\u00e8gue.\n[16] Il convient de noter que depuis le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte, le r\u00e9gime de parrainage des parents et des grands-parents a subi des changements consid\u00e9rables, dont certains ont \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9s par les parties au cours de la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate. Par cons\u00e9quent, certaines all\u00e9gations concernent des politiques qui ne sont plus en vigueur et, dans certains cas, M. Attaran a parl\u00e9 d\u2019actes d\u2019IRCC et d\u2019effets n\u00e9gatifs qui ne s\u2019appliquaient pas \u00e0 sa propre demande de parrainage (partie 1 du processus de demande de parrainage) et aux demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente de ses parents (partie 2 du processus de demande). Les autres all\u00e9gations seront abord\u00e9es dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, mais la plainte mettait principalement l\u2019accent sur le d\u00e9lai long et disproportionn\u00e9 subi par la famille Attaran et d\u2019autres personnes qui souhaitaient parrainer un parent ou un grand-parent pour immigrer au Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[17] Le temps qui s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre la r\u00e9ception de la demande de r\u00e9sidence permanente des parents de M. Attaran et l\u2019approbation finale par IRCC et le fait que ce temps ait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus long que pour les demandes de l\u2019autre cat\u00e9gorie principale de la famille (FC1) au cours de la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode ne sont pas contest\u00e9s.\n[18] Au contraire, l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment essentiel de la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est que les facteurs qui ont contribu\u00e9 aux d\u00e9lais de traitement plus longs ne d\u00e9coulent pas des services fournis par IRCC ou le ministre responsable. En 2019, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a obtenu une modification de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin de mettre en cause le fait que les pratiques discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9es se sont produites dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb (2019 TCDP 12). L\u2019intim\u00e9 admet que, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le traitement des demandes est un service qu\u2019il fournit. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 insiste sur le fait que chaque aspect des pratiques de traitement qui sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9es comme \u00e9tant discriminatoires par le plaignant et la Commission d\u00e9coule d\u2019une action gouvernementale qui n\u2019est pas un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP et que, par cons\u00e9quent, la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e au stade de la preuve prima facie.\n[19] Dans leur plaidoyer final, le plaignant et la Commission ont soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ne s\u2019attaquaient pas aux actions du gouvernement consistant \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur la LIPR, \u00e0 adopter des r\u00e8glements ou \u00e0 approuver les fourchettes cibles du nombre de personnes pouvant \u00eatre admises comme r\u00e9sidents permanents chaque ann\u00e9e. Au contraire, le plaignant et la Commission ont sp\u00e9cifiquement demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9valuer si IRCC s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire lorsqu\u2019elle a trait\u00e9 la demande du plaignant de parrainer ses parents et la demande de statut de r\u00e9sident permanent de ses parents. Le plaignant et la Commission all\u00e8guent que les d\u00e9cisions discr\u00e9tionnaires prises par l\u2019intim\u00e9, les d\u00e9cisions discr\u00e9tionnaires prises par le ministre lorsqu\u2019il accorde des dispenses en vertu du paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR et l\u2019\u00e9mission par le ministre d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles en vertu de l\u2019article 87.3 de la LIPR font partie des actes qui constituent des pratiques discriminatoires pendant le traitement des demandes.\nV. CONTEXTE L\u00c9GISLATIF [20] Pour bien situer la plainte dans son contexte, il est n\u00e9cessaire de d\u00e9crire les r\u00e9gimes l\u00e9gislatifs, r\u00e9glementaires et politiques qui affectent les demandes de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial, comme celle de M. Attaran. En vertu de la LIPR, il existe trois cat\u00e9gories principales d\u2019immigration : regroupement familial, immigration \u00e9conomique et r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Au sein de chaque grand groupe, il existe des sous-groupes d\u2019immigrants pour lesquels les r\u00e8gles et les exigences d\u2019admission au Canada sont diff\u00e9rentes.\n[21] L\u2019article 117 du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (DORS\/2002-227) [le \u00ab r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR \u00bb) d\u00e9finit les \u00e9trangers susceptibles de faire partie de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial et de pouvoir \u00eatre parrain\u00e9s pour immigrer au Canada. L\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tranger d\u00e9pend du lien de parent\u00e9 avec le membre de leur famille, qui doit \u00eatre un citoyen canadien ou un r\u00e9sident permanent et qui peut donc les parrainer. Bien qu\u2019il existe plusieurs types de membres potentiels dans la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial, la grande majorit\u00e9 des demandes re\u00e7ues chaque ann\u00e9e concerne deux cat\u00e9gories seulement : a) les FC1 (principalement les \u00e9poux, les partenaires et les enfants \u00e0 charge); et b) les PGP (parents et grands-parents), parfois \u00e9galement appel\u00e9s FC4.\n[22] La plainte de M. Attaran d\u00e9crit le processus en deux \u00e9tapes pour parrainer un membre de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial. Tout d\u2019abord, le parrain potentiel au Canada doit remplir la partie 1 de la demande de parrainage \u00e0 son sujet, ce qui aide l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du demandeur au parrainage. Un certain nombre de facteurs sont pris en compte, notamment le niveau de revenu du demandeur et sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 subvenir aux besoins du ou des membres de la famille immigr\u00e9e parrain\u00e9e. La deuxi\u00e8me partie de la proc\u00e9dure est la demande des membres de la famille parrain\u00e9s (partie 2), qui contient des informations \u00e0 leur sujet. La proc\u00e9dure de demande comprend \u00e9galement la v\u00e9rification des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et des r\u00e9sultats d\u2019un examen m\u00e9dical afin de s\u2019assurer que les exigences l\u00e9gislatives applicables \u00e0 tous les immigrants au Canada sont respect\u00e9es. Pour ces raisons, les parties 1 et 2 forment ensemble la \u00ab demande \u00bb de la famille Attaran, tandis que la partie 1 peut \u00e9galement \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme la demande de parrainage et la partie 2 comme la demande de r\u00e9sidence permanente.\n[23] L\u2019article 94 de la LIPR exige que le ministre responsable d\u00e9pose devant le Parlement un rapport annuel sur l\u2019application de la LIPR au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente. En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(2)b) de la LIPR, ce rapport annuel doit \u00e9galement inclure une description du nombre d\u2019\u00e9trangers qui sont devenus r\u00e9sidents permanents et du nombre de ceux qui devraient devenir r\u00e9sidents permanents au Canada au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. Les parties ont d\u00e9crit le plan annuel de projection des nouveaux immigrants comme le [Traduction] \u00ab plan des niveaux \u00bb. Bien que le paragraphe 94(1) stipule qu\u2019il incombe au ministre de pr\u00e9senter le rapport annuel au Parlement, la mani\u00e8re dont le plan des niveaux est \u00e9labor\u00e9 n\u2019est pas prescrite par le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif. Le caract\u00e8re et l\u2019importance des plans des niveaux sont examin\u00e9s plus loin.\n[24] D\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, la LIPR est une loi qui d\u00e9finit le cadre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019immigration. Elle ne donne qu\u2019un aper\u00e7u de la structure principale du programme. Elle aborde des questions telles que les objectifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux du programme d\u2019immigration, les conditions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales d\u2019immigration (telles que des v\u00e9rifications claires des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents et des examens m\u00e9dicaux), les d\u00e9tails concernant la Commission de l\u2019immigration et du statut de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 et l\u2019application de la loi.\n[25] Les d\u00e9tails concernant les personnes qui entrent au Canada et celles qui n\u2019y entrent pas sont subordonn\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. Ce r\u00e8glement d\u00e9finit les exigences d\u00e9taill\u00e9es pour chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019immigration. Le r\u00e9gime d\u2019\u00e9valuation des points pour les cat\u00e9gories \u00e9conomiques est d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail. Les exigences relatives aux cat\u00e9gories du regroupement familial et des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s sont \u00e9galement \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR.\n[26] Outre la LIPR, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR et les plans des niveaux, le traitement des demandes d\u2019immigration est \u00e9galement affect\u00e9 par les instructions minist\u00e9rielles. En 2008, la LIPR a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e par l\u2019ajout de l\u2019article 87.3, qui autorise le ministre \u00e0 \u00e9tablir des instructions minist\u00e9rielles pour atteindre les objectifs du gouvernement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration. Les instructions minist\u00e9rielles et l\u2019article 87 sont examin\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail plus loin dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs.\n[27] Un autre type de mesure prise par le ministre et qui est en cause dans cette affaire est la d\u00e9livrance de dispenses \u00e0 tout crit\u00e8re ou toute obligation applicable en vertu de la LIPR pour un \u00e9tranger qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne remplit pas les conditions normales d\u2019immigration. Le ministre est habilit\u00e9 \u00e0 accorder des dispenses pour des raisons d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en vertu du paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR.\n[28] Outre ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le traitement des demandes d\u2019immigration est \u00e9galement fond\u00e9 sur les d\u00e9cisions sur la politique d\u2019IRCC. Il s\u2019agit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de d\u00e9cisions administratives d\u2019IRCC ordonnant \u00e0 ses agents de traiter les demandes d\u2019une mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re.\nVI. CONTEXTE HISTORIQUE DE LA PLAINTE [29] Lorsque l\u2019on examine les d\u00e9lais de traitement plus longs des PGP \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque de la demande de M. Attaran, il est utile de replacer cette p\u00e9riode dans un contexte plus large. D\u2019un point de vue historique, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1980, la politique d\u2019immigration canadienne a altern\u00e9 entre des p\u00e9riodes d\u2019afflux importants visant des objectifs \u00e9conomiques sp\u00e9cifiques et des p\u00e9riodes de quasi-fermeture de l\u2019immigration face aux mauvaises conditions du march\u00e9 du travail national. Alors que le niveau d\u2019immigration n\u2019\u00e9tait que de 83 402 en 1985, il est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de 250 000 en 1993 et les niveaux d\u2019immigration sont rest\u00e9s \u00e9lev\u00e9s depuis lors, atteignant actuellement environ 400 000 \u00e0 500 000 nouveaux immigrants par an. La notion de r\u00e9duction de l\u2019immigration en p\u00e9riode de ch\u00f4mage \u00e9lev\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e dans les ann\u00e9es 1990 au profit d\u2019objectifs \u00e0 long terme visant \u00e0 maintenir un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9 de nouveaux immigrants. [Voir \u00ab The Economic Goals of Canada\u2019s Immigration Policy: Past and Present \u00bb par Alan G. Green (Universit\u00e9 Queen\u2019s) et David A. Green (Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique) pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 avec l\u2019argument \u00e9crit final du plaignant, que j\u2019appellerai le \u00ab m\u00e9moire \u00bb du plaignant].\n[30] Ce changement historique, la d\u00e9cision de maintenir constamment l\u2019immigration \u00e0 un niveau \u00e9lev\u00e9, qui a commenc\u00e9 au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1990, a eu un effet important sur cette plainte et sur le traitement de toutes les demandes de parrainage de PGP. Pour pouvoir parrainer l\u2019immigration de ses parents ou grands-parents, il faut d\u2019abord \u00eatre citoyen canadien ou r\u00e9sident permanent. Deuxi\u00e8mement, les parents ou les grands-parents ne doivent pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 se trouver au Canada en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents ou citoyens. Par cons\u00e9quent, le groupe de parrains potentiels est principalement compos\u00e9 de nouveaux immigrants au Canada. \u00c0 la fin des ann\u00e9es 1990 et au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000, la taille de ce groupe a consid\u00e9rablement augment\u00e9, tout comme la demande de parrainage de PGP.\n[31] Au cours de l\u2019audience, M. Attaran a remis un document \u00e0 M. Glen Tetford, le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9 responsable du traitement des demandes de parrainage en vertu de la partie 1 au Centre de traitement des demandes d\u2019IRCC \u00e0 Mississauga, en Ontario (CTD\u2011Mississauga ou CTD-M). M. Tetford a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019apparente v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de ce document, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 admis comme pi\u00e8ce 84. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un document d\u2019IRCC intitul\u00e9 \u00ab PGP Diagnostique \u00bb de 2017, qui d\u00e9crit l\u2019historique suivant de la r\u00e9ception par IRCC des demandes de parrainage de PGP :\n[Traduction]\nJusqu\u2019au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 2000, le minist\u00e8re a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de suivre le rythme de r\u00e9ception des demandes, en traitant les demandes de PGP avec un retard minime. Il n\u2019y avait pas de limite num\u00e9rique au nombre de demandes et le traitement suivait largement le rythme des demandes, bien que dans certains cas, les demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente des PGP aient \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es dans des d\u00e9lais l\u00e9g\u00e8rement plus longs que celles des conjoints et partenaires.\nToutefois, en 2001, il est devenu \u00e9vident que le nombre de demandes de PGP re\u00e7ues commen\u00e7ait \u00e0 d\u00e9passer la capacit\u00e9 du minist\u00e8re \u00e0 traiter ces demandes, ce qui entra\u00eenait des arri\u00e9r\u00e9s de r\u00e9serve et des temps d\u2019attente de plus en plus longs [...]\nLa demande accrue \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ensemble du programme et la r\u00e9ponse du minist\u00e8re sous la forme d\u2019une gestion d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et strat\u00e9gique des niveaux ont eu pour effet de limiter le nombre de dossiers de PGP \u00e0 traiter chaque ann\u00e9e. Pour la premi\u00e8re fois, en 2002, il y a eu un arri\u00e9r\u00e9 de dossiers de PGP et, en l\u2019espace de quelques mois, les d\u00e9lais de traitement des PGP se sont consid\u00e9rablement allong\u00e9s. En 2003, le nombre de demandes de parrainage pour les PGP a atteint 50 000, tandis que le nombre de plans des niveaux et d\u2019atterrissages avoisinait les 20 000. En raison d\u2019un nombre de demandes bien sup\u00e9rieur aux objectifs fix\u00e9s, les r\u00e9serves ont continu\u00e9 \u00e0 augmenter jusqu\u2019en 2011, date \u00e0 laquelle elles ont atteint plus de 168 000 demandeurs de PGP et des temps d\u2019attente pr\u00e9vus de 6 \u00e0 11 ans pour ceux qui sont dans la file d\u2019attente.\n[32] En 2002, le gouvernement a mis en \u0153uvre une r\u00e9vision majeure de son cadre d\u2019immigration avec l\u2019introduction d\u2019une nouvelle loi sur l\u2019immigration, l\u2019IRPA, puis du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de l\u2019IRPA.\n[33] Dans une d\u00e9claration sous serment de 2006 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Attaran (pi\u00e8ce 16), un cadre sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019intim\u00e9, David Manicom, d\u00e9clare aux paragraphes 28 et 29 :\n[Traduction]\n28. \u00c0 ma connaissance, au cours des ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dant 2001, il n\u2019y a eu que peu ou pas de diff\u00e9rence entre les \u00ab fourchettes cibles \u00bb d\u00e9finies dans les rapports annuels au Parlement et le nombre r\u00e9el de demandes de parrainage de visas d\u2019immigrant \u00e9manant de membres de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial.\n29. Il n\u2019y a pas eu d\u2019accumulation significative de cas en r\u00e9serve parce que le nombre de parents et de grands-parents pr\u00e9sentant une demande d\u2019immigration parrain\u00e9e correspondait environ au nombre de parents et de grands-parents que le Canada souhaitait admettre sur son territoire chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[34] En 2009, lorsque M. Attaran a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parrainer ses parents, la limite sup\u00e9rieure de la fourchette pr\u00e9vue dans le plan des niveaux pour le nombre de PGP \u00e0 admettre en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait de 19 000. Cependant, en 2009, il y avait 95 597 demandes en attente dans la r\u00e9serve pour la cat\u00e9gorie des PGP. Afin de ne pas d\u00e9passer les objectifs du plan des niveaux chaque ann\u00e9e, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne traitait qu\u2019un nombre limit\u00e9 de ces demandes dans la file d\u2019attente de la r\u00e9serve.\nVII. L\u2019EXP\u00c9RIENCE DE M. ATTARAN ET SES PARENTS [35] M. Tetford a examin\u00e9 les pi\u00e8ces 2, 3 et 82 relatives \u00e0 la demande du plaignant. M. Tetford a confirm\u00e9 que la demande de parrainage en vertu de la partie 1 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue par le CTD-Mississauga le 14 juillet 2009. Il a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 une lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 la page 52 de la pi\u00e8ce 3. Cette lettre d\u2019IRCC \u00e0 M. Attaran est dat\u00e9e du 30 mars 2012. La lettre indique ce qui suit : [Traduction] \u00ab Nous sommes maintenant pr\u00eats \u00e0 commencer le traitement de votre demande de parrainage et nous avons besoin d\u2019informations suppl\u00e9mentaires \u00bb. La lettre contient une liste de contr\u00f4le des documents requis et demande au r\u00e9pondant de les renvoyer dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours.\n[36] M. Tetford a expliqu\u00e9 que cette lettre indique que la demande de M. Attaran, soumise en juillet 2009, \u00e9tait en cours de traitement en mars 2012, soit 32 mois plus tard. Lorsqu\u2019on lui a demand\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait advenu de la demande de parrainage de M. Attaran entre juillet 2009 et mai 2012, M. Tetford a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait essentiellement rest\u00e9e [Traduction] \u00ab dormante sur une tablette \u00bb \u00e0 attendre son tour d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9e (examen en chef de M. Tetford le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2021).\n[37] Selon la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce 3, les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires demand\u00e9s dans la lettre du 30 mars 2012 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us par le CTD-M le 9 mai 2012. M. Tetford a examin\u00e9 d\u2019autres parties du dossier et a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019apr\u00e8s que M. Attaran a fourni les documents \u00e0 jour, la demande de parrainage en vertu de la partie 1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e le 28 mai 2012, soit 19 jours seulement apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9ception des documents demand\u00e9s. L\u2019ensemble de la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalis\u00e9 le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2012, lorsque les visas de r\u00e9sident permanent ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9s aux parents de M. Attaran.\n[38] Il est \u00e9vident que, sur le temps total \u00e9coul\u00e9 entre le moment o\u00f9 IRCC a re\u00e7u la demande de parrainage de M. Attaran et celui o\u00f9 les visas de r\u00e9sidence permanente de ses parents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9s, la demande a pass\u00e9 la majeure partie de son temps dans la file d\u2019attente de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9. Le temps de traitement actif a \u00e9t\u00e9 relativement court. Apr\u00e8s que la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab retir\u00e9e de la tablette \u00bb en mars 2012, le temps de traitement total d\u2019IRCC pour le regroupement familial des Attaran a \u00e9t\u00e9 inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 neuf mois.\n[39] Le plaignant et son p\u00e8re, M. Kazem Attaran, ont tous deux t\u00e9moign\u00e9 devant le Tribunal de leur exp\u00e9rience et des difficult\u00e9s caus\u00e9es par la longue attente pour le traitement de la demande.\n[40] Le plaignant a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 quel point il \u00e9tait important pour ses enfants d\u2019avoir une relation \u00e9troite avec leurs grands-parents. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre n\u00e9 et avoir grandi en Californie. Cependant, comme ses parents avaient immigr\u00e9 d\u2019Iran aux \u00c9tats-Unis, il n\u2019avait pas beaucoup de relations avec ses propres grands-parents qui \u00e9taient rest\u00e9s en Iran. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsqu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 de parrainer ses parents, sa femme et lui pr\u00e9voyaient avoir des enfants. Il esp\u00e9rait que ses parents pourraient \u00eatre au Canada en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents pour l\u2019aider lui et sa femme lorsque les enfants arriveraient. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsque son premier enfant est n\u00e9 en 2012, ses parents se sont occup\u00e9s de la garde des enfants, ont cuisin\u00e9 pour la famille et les ont aid\u00e9s, lui et son \u00e9pouse, \u00e0 poursuivre leur carri\u00e8re.\n[41] Le plaignant a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ses parents deviennent r\u00e9sidents permanents au d\u00e9but de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013, il ne leur \u00e9tait pas possible d\u2019obtenir une couverture m\u00e9dicale provinciale ou d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux services bancaires et autres services canadiens. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu la r\u00e9sidence permanente, ses parents ont achet\u00e9 une maison \u00e0 environ un p\u00e2t\u00e9 de maisons de la sienne \u00e0 Ottawa. Une fois qu\u2019ils sont devenus r\u00e9sidents permanents, M. Attaran a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ses parents ne craignaient plus de se voir refuser l\u2019entr\u00e9e au Canada et qu\u2019ils pouvaient commencer \u00e0 vivre la vie qu\u2019ils souhaitaient au Canada.\n[42] M. Kazem Attaran a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que son fils, le plaignant, \u00e9tait leur seul enfant. Avant de devenir r\u00e9sident permanent, M. Kazem Attaran rendait habituellement visite \u00e0 son fils et \u00e0 sa famille pendant deux \u00e0 trois semaines au maximum. Apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu la r\u00e9sidence permanente, ils ont achet\u00e9 une maison \u00e0 Ottawa et (avant la pand\u00e9mie de 2020) y sont rest\u00e9s entre 1,5 et 2 mois chaque fois qu\u2019ils sont venus au Canada. Lors du contre-interrogatoire, le p\u00e8re du plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lui et sa femme ont pass\u00e9 environ 50 % de leur temps au Canada entre 2013 et 2020. Il a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait trois propri\u00e9t\u00e9s en Californie, dont sa r\u00e9sidence principale situ\u00e9e sur un terrain de deux acres. Si elle reste inoccup\u00e9e pendant plus de 30 jours, il a un probl\u00e8me avec l\u2019assurance. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa femme et lui b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaient d\u2019une couverture m\u00e9dicale en Californie, o\u00f9 il per\u00e7oit une pension en tant que fonctionnaire retrait\u00e9. M. Kazem Attaran a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais eu de probl\u00e8mes pour entrer au Canada en tant que visiteur avant d\u2019obtenir son statut de r\u00e9sident permanent.\nVIII. TERMINOLOGIE [43] Tout au long de l\u2019audience et dans les observations \u00e9crites, les parties ont utilis\u00e9 une certaine terminologie pour d\u00e9crire le processus et les facteurs qui ont donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 cette plainte. Malheureusement, cette terminologie n\u2019\u00e9tait pas toujours coh\u00e9rente, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 une certaine confusion. Il est important de distinguer les diff\u00e9rentes parties de la proc\u00e9dure de demande, de la r\u00e9ception par IRCC \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision finale, et d\u2019utiliser une terminologie coh\u00e9rente pour cela, afin de mettre en \u00e9vidence les pratiques discriminatoires pr\u00e9sum\u00e9es. Pour \u00e9clairer les pr\u00e9sents motifs, je pr\u00e9cise ci-dessous la signification de la terminologie utilis\u00e9e.\n[44] La r\u00e9serve correspond au nombre de demandes non tranch\u00e9es en la possession d\u2019IRCC \u00e0 tout moment. M. Tetford a expliqu\u00e9 que pour atteindre les objectifs de traitement pour chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie de types d\u2019immigrants dans le plan des niveaux, il faut qu\u2019il y ait une certaine [Traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9serve \u00bb de demandes en attente dans chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie \u00e0 partir de laquelle IRCC peut puiser pour tenter d\u2019atteindre les objectifs de traitement. Le fait de ne pas disposer d\u2019un nombre suffisant de demandes en attente dans la r\u00e9serve constituerait un probl\u00e8me pour atteindre les objectifs.\n[45] L\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u00e9signe le nombre de demandes en la possession d\u2019IRCC qui d\u00e9passe ce qui serait raisonnablement n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019IRCC atteigne ses objectifs de traitement dans cette cat\u00e9gorie au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e. M. Tetford a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que le fait d\u2019avoir trop de demandes en attente dans la r\u00e9serve entra\u00eenerait des arri\u00e9r\u00e9s, car IRCC visait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 ne pas d\u00e9passer la fourchette sup\u00e9rieure des objectifs fix\u00e9s dans le plan des niveaux.\n[46] Le d\u00e9lai de traitement correspond \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e globale d\u2019attente d\u2019un demandeur, \u00e0 partir du moment o\u00f9 la demande est re\u00e7ue par IRCC jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale soit prise. Le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Simon Cardinal, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019IRCC d\u00e9signe le \u00ab d\u00e9lai de traitement \u00bb comme la combinaison des d\u00e9lais d\u2019attente de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 et des d\u00e9lais d\u2019attente de l\u2019examen de la demande. (Examen direct de Simon Cardinal le 20 septembre 2021 \u00e0 02:19:50, m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, par. 119.)\n[47] Le temps d\u2019attente de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u00e9signe la p\u00e9riode qui s\u2019\u00e9tend de la r\u00e9ception d\u2019une demande par un centre de traitement des demandes, et qui compte le temps pass\u00e9 en attente, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la prise en charge du dossier par un agent d\u2019IRCC.\n[48] Le temps d\u2019attente pour l\u2019examen de la demande correspond au temps qu\u2019un agent d\u2019IRCC consacre \u00e0 l\u2019examen de la demande en vue d\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale.\nIX. T\u00c9MOINS\n[49] Le plaignant et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont appel\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience. La Commission et le CSALC n\u2019ont cit\u00e9 aucun t\u00e9moin.\n[50] Le plaignant a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience, comparaissant en son nom propre. Son interrogatoire principal a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de la CCDP. M. Attaran s\u2019exprime tr\u00e8s bien et a r\u00e9pondu franchement \u00e0 la plupart des questions. Il s\u2019est montr\u00e9 r\u00e9ticent \u00e0 donner des indications sur le temps que ses parents ont pass\u00e9 au Canada depuis qu\u2019ils sont devenus r\u00e9sidents permanents en 2013. Il a offert de faire le suivi de cette information s\u2019il pouvait trouver les demandes de renouvellement des cartes de r\u00e9sidence permanente de ses parents, mais si l\u2019information a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au Tribunal. Le contre-interrogatoire du plaignant par l\u2019intim\u00e9 a dur\u00e9 moins de 10 minutes.\n[51] Le deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin du plaignant \u00e9tait son p\u00e8re, M. Kazem Attaran. M. Kazem s\u2019est \u00e9galement exprim\u00e9 tr\u00e8s clairement et a r\u00e9pondu aux questions de mani\u00e8re franche et d\u00e9taill\u00e9e.\n[52] Le dernier t\u00e9moin du plaignant \u00e9tait la professeure Susan Chuang, qui a comparu devant le Tribunal en tant que t\u00e9moin expert. Mme Chuang est professeure agr\u00e9g\u00e9e au d\u00e9partement des relations familiales et de la nutrition appliqu\u00e9e de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Guelph. Mme Chuang a \u00e9t\u00e9 reconnue en tant qu\u2019experte en d\u00e9veloppement humain et en \u00e9tudes familiales, et a men\u00e9 des recherches portant sur l\u2019immigration et l\u2019\u00e9tablissement dans le contexte socioculturel diversifi\u00e9 du Canada. Elle a pr\u00e9par\u00e9 un rapport de 21 pages dat\u00e9 du 11 septembre 2019 pour le Tribunal. Le professeur Chuang a de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert. La qualification de la professeure Chuang en tant qu\u2019experte et la remise de son rapport d\u2019expertise, dont les contre-interrogatoires, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience.\n[53] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a appel\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre trois t\u00e9moins profanes et un t\u00e9moin expert.\n[54] Le premier t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est M. Glen Tetford, directeur adjoint du bureau des affaires humanitaires et de la migration d\u2019IRCC \u00e0 Mississauga (CTD-Mississauga). Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner du point de vue des op\u00e9rations. De 2009 \u00e0 2017, M. Tetford a occup\u00e9 divers postes au CTD-Mississauga li\u00e9s au traitement des demandes de parrainage de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial. Son t\u00e9moignage a \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s utile au Tribunal pour \u00e9tablir le contexte dans lequel la demande du plaignant a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[55] Le deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9 \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur la politique d\u2019IRCC. M. Glen Bornais travaille pour l\u2019intim\u00e9 depuis 2006. Au moment de sa d\u00e9position, il \u00e9tait conseiller principal du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la politique et de la planification strat\u00e9giques de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Jusqu\u2019en 2018, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 analyste principal puis directeur adjoint au sein de cette m\u00eame direction. Ses principales fonctions consistaient \u00e0 assister la direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale dans l\u2019exercice annuel des niveaux afin de pr\u00e9parer des recommandations \u00e0 soumettre au Cabinet pour examen, ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 s\u2019occuper des strat\u00e9gies d\u2019\u00e9limination de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[56] M. Attaran soutient que M. Bornais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible et recommande fortement au Tribunal de ne pas se fier \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage. M. Bornais a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 cette audience pendant trois jours et demi et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 par M. Attaran pendant un jour et demi. M. Attaran a termin\u00e9 son contre-interrogatoire de M. Bornais, qui devait ensuite \u00eatre contre-interrog\u00e9 par la Commission lors de la reprise de l\u2019audience une semaine plus tard. (M. Attaran s\u2019est r\u00e9serv\u00e9 le droit de rappeler M. Bornais pour le contre-interrogatoire, car son t\u00e9moignage faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 certains documents qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 communiqu\u00e9s. M. Attaran a par la suite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate \u00e9crite demandant la communication de ces documents).\n[57] Toutefois, avant la reprise de l\u2019audience, les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont inform\u00e9 le Tribunal que M. Bornais avait un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9 qui l\u2019emp\u00eacherait de retourner \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 n\u2019importe quel moment de l\u2019instance.\n[58] Le plaignant et la Commission ont tous deux exprim\u00e9 leur inqui\u00e9tude quant au fait d\u2019excuser un t\u00e9moin important lorsque son t\u00e9moignage est incomplet. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une lettre m\u00e9dicale confirmant l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin et son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 revenir \u00e0 la barre \u00e0 tout moment. J\u2019ai assur\u00e9 aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 que la lettre serait soumise \u00e0 une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9. Lorsque la premi\u00e8re lettre m\u00e9dicale a \u00e9t\u00e9 soumise, M. Attaran et la Commission se sont inqui\u00e9t\u00e9s du fait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait inad\u00e9quate, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par un m\u00e9decin qui ne reconnaissait pas avoir une bonne connaissance de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du patient, et qu\u2019elle ne fournissait aucun diagnostic clinique d\u2019une quelconque maladie. J\u2019ai souscrit \u00e0 leurs pr\u00e9occupations et j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 par \u00e9crit aux avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de fournir une lettre m\u00e9dicale plus compl\u00e8te afin de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations des autres parties.\n[59] La seconde lettre \u00e9tait mod\u00e9r\u00e9ment meilleure que la premi\u00e8re, bien qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e par le m\u00eame m\u00e9decin d\u2019une clinique d\u2019Ottawa. Au paragraphe 205 de son m\u00e9moire, M. Attaran all\u00e8gue que la deuxi\u00e8me lettre porte plusieurs marques de falsification possible. Il affirme que le refus de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de faire t\u00e9moigner ce m\u00e9decin est suspect. M. Attaran fait observer dans son m\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse (paragraphes 31 \u00e0 35) que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a choisi de ne d\u00e9poser aucune preuve susceptible d\u2019authentifier la lettre du m\u00e9decin. En outre, M. Attaran note que, en vertu de l\u2019article 31.1 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada sur les documents sous forme \u00e9lectronique (la lettre du m\u00e9decin est un fichier PDF), il incombe \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de prouver l\u2019authenticit\u00e9. Lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019apparence d\u2019inauthenticit\u00e9, l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 est simplement pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e et n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e. Lorsque l\u2019authenticit\u00e9 est contest\u00e9e, M. Attaran affirme qu\u2019une preuve doit \u00eatre apport\u00e9e pour \u00e9tablir que le document est ce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre.\n[60] M. Attaran conclut que le Tribunal doit tirer une conclusion d\u00e9favorable du fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 de preuve de maladie (au paragraphe 214 de son m\u00e9moire).\n[61] M. Attaran attaque \u00e9galement la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Bornais sur la base de la mani\u00e8re dont il a r\u00e9pondu aux questions lors du contre-interrogatoire. Il y a eu de nombreuses et longues pauses apr\u00e8s que les questions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es et M. Attaran a d\u00e9crit le t\u00e9moin comme \u00e9tant \u00e9vasif (au paragraphe 207 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant).\n[62] L\u2019intim\u00e9 explique que les longues pauses de son t\u00e9moin sont attribuables aux [Traduction] \u00ab questions r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles relatives aux confidences du Cabinet \u00bb (au paragraphe 50 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9). Il qualifie \u00e9galement de non fond\u00e9e l\u2019all\u00e9gation de falsification (paragraphe 54 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9). L\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que l\u2019attaque contre la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de M. Bornais est \u00e0 la fois inutile et injustifi\u00e9e. Il fait \u00e9galement observer que toutes les parties se sont appuy\u00e9es dans leurs arguments finaux sur le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bornais et sur les pi\u00e8ces dont il a parl\u00e9.\n[63] Il est regrettable que M. Bornais n\u2019ait pas pu terminer son t\u00e9moignage. L\u2019all\u00e9gation de falsification est intervenue tardivement dans la proc\u00e9dure et l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a fait que r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation comme \u00e9tant sans fondement. Si l\u2019all\u00e9gation de falsification avait \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e plus t\u00f4t au cours de l\u2019audience, des preuves corroborantes auraient peut-\u00eatre pu \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es. Je ne vais donc pas sp\u00e9culer sur le fait que l\u2019absence de M. Bornais \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins \u00e9tait due \u00e0 autre chose qu\u2019\u00e0 ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9. Cependant, je suis d\u2019accord avec M. Attaran pour dire que M. Bornais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin spontan\u00e9 et franc lors du contre-interrogatoire. Il y a eu de nombreuses et longues pauses silencieuses, m\u00eame apr\u00e8s que j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de l\u2019aider en reformulant certaines questions litigieuses qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es.\n[64] Bien que les circonstances du t\u00e9moignage de M. Bornais aient \u00e9t\u00e9 loin d\u2019\u00eatre id\u00e9ales, il a fourni un t\u00e9moignage pr\u00e9cieux sur lequel toutes les parties se sont appuy\u00e9es. Sa r\u00e9ticence au cours de certaines parties de son contre-interrogatoire concernait la cr\u00e9ation du plan des niveaux par le Cabinet et ce qui s\u2019est pass\u00e9 au cours de ce processus. Cependant, je n\u2019ai pas trouv\u00e9 de raison de douter de la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 des preuves fournies par M. Bornais. Je pense qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sinc\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019il a r\u00e9pondu aux questions. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e9tait li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il consid\u00e9rait comme ses obligations de confidentialit\u00e9 concernant le privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet.\n[65] Le dernier t\u00e9moin profane de la partie d\u00e9fenderesse \u00e9tait M. Simon Cardinal. M. Cardinal a travaill\u00e9 pour IRCC pendant 13 ans. Son t\u00e9moignage s\u2019appuie principalement sur son exp\u00e9rience en tant que directeur de la Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la planification et du rendement des op\u00e9rations, qui, selon lui, a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la r\u00e9alisation des objectifs fix\u00e9s dans le plan des niveaux. M. Cardinal a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 la barre des t\u00e9moins pendant cinq des jours d\u2019audience, dont quatre jours de contre-interrogatoire. M. Cardinal a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9t\u00e9 un t\u00e9moin utile, mais il a parfois h\u00e9sit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 des questions qui, selon lui, pouvaient entrer en conflit avec ses obligations professionnelles.\n[66] En r\u00e9ponse au t\u00e9moin expert du plaignant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a command\u00e9 son propre rapport d\u2019expert, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par le professeur Michael Haan, professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 \u00e0 la facult\u00e9 de sociologie de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 Western Ontario. M. Haan \u00e9tait titulaire de la Chaire de recherche du Canada sur la migration et les relations ethniques et de la Chaire de recherche du Canada sur la population et la politique sociale. Lors de l\u2019audience, le professeur Haan a \u00e9t\u00e9 qualifi\u00e9 d\u2019expert dans les domaines de l\u2019immigration, de la d\u00e9mographie, des march\u00e9s du travail canadiens, du d\u00e9veloppement des donn\u00e9es, de l\u2019infrastructure des donn\u00e9es et des choix r\u00e9sidentiels des nouveaux arrivants au Canada.\n[67] M. Attaran et la Commission ont vigoureusement contest\u00e9 les qualifications du professeur Haan en tant qu\u2019expert et se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019introduction de son rapport. En cons\u00e9quence, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur son expertise pendant la majeure partie de deux jours d\u2019audience. Un apr\u00e8s-midi entier a \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 la question de savoir si le Tribunal devait ou non accepter le professeur Haan en tant qu\u2019expert. M. Attaran et la Commission ont tous deux soutenu que je devrais suivre les tests d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019affaire White Burgess Langille Inman c. Abbott and Haliburton Co. (2015 CSC 23) (White Burgess). Ils ont fait valoir que le professeur Haan ne devrait pas \u00eatre accept\u00e9 comme t\u00e9moin expert pour plusieurs raisons. Ils ont \u00e9galement fait valoir que les quatre principes \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mohan, (1994 2 SCR 9 (Mohan), \u00e0 savoir la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert, devraient \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9s.\n[68] Les tests de Mohan et de White Burgess avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 rigoureusement appliqu\u00e9s dans une d\u00e9cision pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente rendue par un autre membre de ce Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Christoforou c. John Grant Haulage Ltd. (2016 TCDP 14) (Christoforou.) Dans cette affaire, membre Bryan a fait une application stricte de ces tests dans sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et le rapport et le t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exclus. M. Attaran et la Commission ont longuement argument\u00e9 que je devrais suivre la d\u00e9cision sur Christoforou en faisant une application stricte des tests de Mohan et de White Burgess. Selon eux, le professeur Haan n\u2019\u00e9tait pas suffisamment qualifi\u00e9 pour aborder le large \u00e9ventail de sujets abord\u00e9s dans son rapport d\u2019expert, qui \u00e9tait en leur possession depuis plus d\u2019un an au moment o\u00f9 il a t\u00e9moign\u00e9. M. Attaran a qualifi\u00e9 le professeur Haan de [Traduction] \u00ab couteau suisse des experts \u00bb, car, selon lui, le rapport d\u2019expertise du professeur Haan traitait de sujets dont il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment expert.\n[69] Dans ses observations, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, Me Stynes, a fait remarquer que dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate Christoforou, l\u2019avocat principal de longue date de la Commission, Daniel Poulin, avait soutenu exactement le contraire. En tant que partie repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public, Ma\u00eetre Poulin a pris la position que le Tribunal devrait \u00eatre plus lib\u00e9ral dans son approche, en utilisant son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)(c) pour accepter la preuve. Certains de ses arguments ont \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9s dans les paragraphes suivants de Christoforou :\n[34] La Commission a soutenu par ailleurs :\n[Traduction]\nRejeter le ou les rapports, comme le demande le plaignant, imposerait de strictes obligations aux parties qui compara\u00eetraient plus tard devant le Tribunal et sur-judiciariserait le processus suivi devant ce dernier. En fin de compte, cette mesure serait incompatible avec la souplesse que doivent comporter les proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal et elle cr\u00e9erait ult\u00e9rieurement des obstacles pour les plaignants non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s.\n[41] Aux dires de la Commission, on ne peut pas accueillir la requ\u00eate du plaignant sans permettre au juge des faits de soupeser les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que fourniront les t\u00e9moins, et elle cite \u00e0 cet effet la d\u00e9cision SSEFPN. Comme elle l\u2019indique : [traduction] \u00ab les R\u00e8gles ne contiennent pas de disposition portant sur l\u2019exclusion d\u2019un rapport d\u2019expert, et le Tribunal se doit de prendre garde de ne pas recourir \u00e0 une mesure extraordinaire, comme radier une large tranche de la preuve d\u2019une partie \u00bb.\n[70] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ces observations dans l\u2019affaire Christoforou et du devoir d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u2019aider le Tribunal, M. Stynes a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il trouvait [traduction] \u00ab inconcevable \u00bb que la Commission adopte une position compl\u00e8tement oppos\u00e9e dans cette affaire. (enregistrement de l\u2019audience \u00e0 01:57 le 28 avril 2021)\n[71] Apr\u00e8s avoir autoris\u00e9 de longues plaidoiries sur la recevabilit\u00e9 du professeur Haan et de son rapport d\u2019expertise, j\u2019ai pris ma d\u00e9cision \u00e0 la fin de la journ\u00e9e d\u2019audience. Le matin du 29 avril 2021, j\u2019ai rendu ma d\u00e9cision et j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que je fournirais des motifs plus complets dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur le fond.\n[72] J\u2019ai inform\u00e9 oralement les parties que j\u2019accepterais le professeur Haan et son rapport en vertu du large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui m\u2019est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c) de la LCDP, qui est libell\u00e9 comme suit :\n50 (3) Pour la tenue de ses audiences, le membre instructeur a le pouvoir :\nc) de recevoir, sous r\u00e9serve des paragraphes (4) et (5), des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou des renseignements par d\u00e9claration verbale ou \u00e9crite sous serment ou par tout autre moyen qu\u2019il estime indiqu\u00e9, ind\u00e9pendamment de leur admissibilit\u00e9 devant un tribunal judiciaire;\n[73] Je suis davantage convaincu par l\u2019argument de la Commission dans l\u2019affaire Christoforou selon lequel le Tribunal doit rester flexible et ne pas judiciariser excessivement la proc\u00e9dure, en particulier compte tenu du nombre de plaignants non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s qui comparaissent devant lui.\n[74] Les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate d\u2019un membre du Tribunal ne sont pas contraignantes pour les affaires ult\u00e9rieures devant le TCDP. \u00c0 mon avis, la d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate de Christoforou \u00e9tait un cas particulier. En revanche, le Tribunal a g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tendance \u00e0 admettre des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en vertu du large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)c).\n[75] J\u2019ai inform\u00e9 oralement le plaignant et la Commission que leurs arguments \u00e9taient bien not\u00e9s et qu\u2019ils auraient l\u2019occasion de contester ult\u00e9rieurement le poids et la pertinence du rapport.\n[76] Le professeur Haan a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 pendant huit jours d\u2019audience. Les questions de M. Attaran ont mis en lumi\u00e8re un certain nombre de lacunes dans le rapport d\u2019expertise, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 bien not\u00e9es. En fin de compte, cependant, il y a peu d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments dans le rapport du professeur Haan, ou dans son t\u00e9moignage, sur lesquels je m\u2019appuie dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur le fond.\nX. QUESTIONS PR\u00c9LIMINAIRES\n[77] Les parties ont soulev\u00e9 deux questions importantes qu\u2019il convient d\u2019aborder en premier lieu. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la plainte est th\u00e9orique. Le plaignant fait valoir que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a tir\u00e9 des conclusions dans l\u2019affaire Attaran c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2015 CAF 37 (Attaran-CAF) sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du test prima facie qui lient le Tribunal dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate.\nA. LA PLAINTE EST-ELLE TH\u00c9ORIQUE ? [78] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que cette plainte est th\u00e9orique et qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de l\u2019entendre. Selon lui, il n\u2019y a pas de controverse vivante entre les parties puisque la plainte concerne des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui se sont produits entre 2009 et 2012. Les parents de M. Attaran sont des r\u00e9sidents permanents du Canada depuis 2013 et, par cons\u00e9quent, M. Attaran n\u2019a plus d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel dans le parrainage du PGP. En outre, depuis que M. Attaran a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande, des changements radicaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s au programme du PGP et les longs retards qui l\u2019ont affect\u00e9, lui et sa famille, n\u2019existent plus.\n[79] Le plaignant fait valoir que la plainte n\u2019est pas th\u00e9orique. Il cite la d\u00e9cision sur la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire (2013 CF 1132) qui a conclu que la plainte n\u2019\u00e9tait pas th\u00e9orique (au paragraphe 47) en raison des all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et du fait que les d\u00e9lais de traitement demeuraient \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. M. Attaran soutient en outre que la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale n\u2019aurait pas rendu de d\u00e9cision en sa faveur si la plainte \u00e9tait effectivement th\u00e9orique. Selon lui, cette question a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, elle est rev\u00eatue de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e (res judicata) et ne peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un nouveau litige.\n[80] La Commission soutient que la plainte n\u2019est pas th\u00e9orique. Elle soutient que le Tribunal devrait proc\u00e9der \u00e0 la d\u00e9termination de la responsabilit\u00e9 et accorder les r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il y a eu violation de la LCDP. Elle affirme qu\u2019il existe des preuves de discrimination syst\u00e9mique et que la plainte vise \u00e0 r\u00e9parer les transgressions pass\u00e9es de M. Attaran et d\u2019autres personnes comme lui.\n[81] L\u2019intim\u00e9 cite l\u2019arr\u00eat Borowski c. Canada (1989 1 RCS 342) de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada et sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019analyse du caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique du litige devrait se d\u00e9rouler en deux \u00e9tapes. La premi\u00e8re question est de savoir s\u2019il subsiste une controverse r\u00e9elle qui affecte ou peut affecter les droits des parties. Une d\u00e9cision qui n\u2019aura aucun effet pratique sur les parties est th\u00e9orique. Si la proc\u00e9dure est th\u00e9orique, une deuxi\u00e8me question se pose : le tribunal doit-il n\u00e9anmoins exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour l\u2019entendre et la trancher? La Cour supr\u00eame met en garde contre l\u2019audition de d\u00e9cisions qui pourraient \u00eatre th\u00e9oriques. L\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire doit tenir compte de la persistance d\u2019un litige entre les parties, des principes d\u2019\u00e9conomie judiciaire et de la question de savoir si l\u2019examen d\u2019un argument th\u00e9orique conduira \u00e0 un pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent inutile, impliquant un abandon du r\u00f4le juridictionnel au profit du domaine l\u00e9gislatif.\n[82] Il n\u2019y a pas de controverse vivante concernant la finalisation du parrainage de M. Attaran (partie 1) ou la demande d\u2019immigration de ses parents (partie 2). La plainte n\u2019a jamais port\u00e9 sur la question de savoir si ses parents obtiendraient la r\u00e9sidence permanente, mais plut\u00f4t sur le temps qu\u2019il a fallu pour traiter les demandes. Ses parents ont obtenu le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent bien avant que sa plainte ne soit soumise \u00e0 ce Tribunal. La question est de savoir si M. Attaran et ses parents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019une discrimination interdite en vertu de la LCDP, y compris si sa plainte \u00e9tablit une discrimination syst\u00e9mique et, dans l\u2019affirmative, quelles sont les r\u00e9parations appropri\u00e9es.\n[83] La LCDP est une loi du Parlement qui vise \u00e0 r\u00e9tablir les victimes de discrimination dans la situation o\u00f9 elles se trouveraient s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de discrimination. Les pouvoirs de r\u00e9paration accord\u00e9s au Tribunal en vertu de la LCDP sont vastes, y compris la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019ordonner la mise \u00e0 disposition des droits, des opportunit\u00e9s ou des privil\u00e8ges qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 refus\u00e9s, et l\u2019indemnisation de certaines d\u00e9penses. En outre, de mani\u00e8re tout \u00e0 fait symbolique, les victimes peuvent se voir accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour la douleur et la souffrance caus\u00e9es par le comportement discriminatoire. En outre, le paragraphe 53(3) autorise l\u2019octroi de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats sp\u00e9ciaux dans les cas o\u00f9 le comportement fautif de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 imprudent ou d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[84] La plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e devant le Tribunal porte sur la mani\u00e8re dont M. Attaran et ses parents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s, ainsi que sur la mani\u00e8re dont des candidats similaires de la cat\u00e9gorie PGP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9s, et non sur le r\u00e9sultat final de ces demandes. Il a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 possible que la diff\u00e9rence de traitement pr\u00e9judiciable all\u00e9gu\u00e9e puisse conduire \u00e0 une conclusion de responsabilit\u00e9 qui pourrait impliquer \u00e0 juste titre des recours individuels et\/ou d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public. La plainte n\u2019est pas th\u00e9orique.\nB. LA COUR D\u2019APPEL F\u00c9D\u00c9RALE A-T-ELLE TIR\u00c9 DES CONCLUSIONS DANS L\u2019AFFAIRE ATTARAN-FCA SUR LES \u00c9L\u00c9MENTS DU TEST PRIMA FACIE QUI LIENT LE TRIBUNAL DANS CETTE ENQU\u00caTE? [85] M. Attaran affirme que plusieurs questions ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (CAF) dans sa demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire. En plus du point sur le caract\u00e8re th\u00e9orique pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, M. Attaran affirme que le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille a l'autorit\u00e9 de la chose jug\u00e9e (res judicata) dans l\u2019affaire Attaran-CAF. Selon lui, les mains du Tribunal sont li\u00e9es par ces conclusions et le Tribunal commettrait une erreur de droit s\u2019il en d\u00e9cidait autrement (par. 10 \u00e0 12 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant).\n[86] Comme mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, la Commission a initialement rejet\u00e9 la plainte de M. Attaran en juillet 2011, car elle estimait qu\u2019une enqu\u00eate du Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas justifi\u00e9e. Lorsque la demande de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de M. Attaran a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, il en a fait appel aupr\u00e8s de la CAF. Dans l\u2019affaire Attaran-CAF, la CAF s\u2019est prononc\u00e9e \u00e0 deux contre un en sa faveur, les juges Webb et Stratas s\u2019\u00e9tant ralli\u00e9s au r\u00e9sultat pour dire que la d\u00e9cision sur le fond de la Commission de ne pas renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal \u00e9tait d\u00e9raisonnable. En arrivant \u00e0 cette conclusion, les juges Webb et Stratas ont fait des commentaires sur l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la plainte par la Commission.\n[87] Le juge Webb a r\u00e9dig\u00e9 les motifs de l\u2019arr\u00eat de la majorit\u00e9, apr\u00e8s avoir observ\u00e9, lors de l\u2019audience de l\u2019appel, que les deux parties s\u2019\u00e9taient concentr\u00e9es sur la question de savoir si la diff\u00e9rence de traitement \u00e9tait justifi\u00e9e de bonne foi :\n[8] La juge de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a conclu que le fondement de la d\u00e9cision de la CCDP de ne pas renvoyer l\u2019affaire au Tribunal reposait sur la question de l\u2019existence d\u2019un motif justifiable \u00e0 l\u2019acte de CIC. Bien que les deux parties, en pr\u00e9sentant leurs observations dans le pr\u00e9sent appel, soient parties de l\u2019hypoth\u00e8se que la CCDP avait bien fond\u00e9 sa d\u00e9cision sur cette question, il est loin d\u2019\u00eatre clair qu\u2019il en a vraiment \u00e9t\u00e9 ainsi, tel qu\u2019on le verra plus loin. (ibid. paragraphe 8)\n[88] Au paragraphe 31 de ses motifs, le juge Webb revient sur la d\u00e9cision sur le fond de la CCDP :\n[31] Alors qu\u2019elle d\u00e9clare que [traduction] \u00ab [CIC] ne semble pas avoir r\u00e9serv\u00e9 au plaignant un traitement diff\u00e9rent et pr\u00e9judiciable fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00bb, la CCDP ne fait aucune allusion \u00e0 la question de savoir si CIC a accord\u00e9 au plaignant un traitement diff\u00e9rent fond\u00e9 sur la situation de famille. La CCDP fait aussi \u00e9tat d\u2019une explication raisonnable pour le traitement diff\u00e9rent des demandes de parrainage touchant les parents et les grands\u2011parents, mais elle ne mentionne dans sa lettre ni la question du motif justifiable ni celle des contraintes excessives.\n[89] Au paragraphe 19 de la d\u00e9cision, le juge Webb d\u00e9clare que la Commission a implicitement accept\u00e9 que la question de savoir si une personne est un parent \u00e9tablisse le motif de la situation familiale :\n[19] La situation de famille figure parmi les motifs de distinction illicite \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP. La CCDP a implicitement admis qu\u2019un traitement diff\u00e9renci\u00e9 en fonction du fait qu\u2019une personne est soit un parent, soit un \u00e9poux (ou un enfant), serait une diff\u00e9rence de traitement fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille. Le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral n\u2019a aucunement mis en question cette interpr\u00e9tation de la notion de situation de famille.\n[90] Le juge Webb a not\u00e9 que la Commission semblait accepter l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire et semblait avoir conclu que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre constituait une justification. Cependant, en vertu de la LCDP, si une pratique discriminatoire est constat\u00e9e, les justifications possibles se limitent aux moyens de d\u00e9fense pr\u00e9vus par la loi. Le juge Webb a soulign\u00e9 que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre n\u2019est pas une justification l\u00e9gale en vertu de la LCDP au paragraphe 35 :\n[35] En mentionnant dans sa d\u00e9cision que l\u2019explication donn\u00e9e est [traduction] \u00ab raisonnable et ne rel\u00e8ve pas du pr\u00e9texte \u00bb, la CCDP laisse supposer que cette explication permettrait de conclure que CIC n\u2019a pas commis d\u2019acte discriminatoire au sens des articles 5 \u00e0 14.1 de la LCDP. Dans la partie de sa d\u00e9cision qu\u2019on a reproduite, la CCDP semble toutefois reconna\u00eetre que l\u2019acte est discriminatoire, quoique justifi\u00e9 par l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel. Cependant, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel n\u2019est pas l\u2019une des exceptions reconnues dans la LCDP. Puisqu\u2019il faut d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019une contrainte excessive \u00ab en mati\u00e8re de co\u00fbts, de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00bb (paragraphe 15(2) de la LCDP), l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire minist\u00e9riel, \u00e0 lui seul, ne permettrait pas de conclure que CIC subirait une contrainte excessive s\u2019il lui fallait traiter plus rapidement les demandes de parrainage touchant les parents.\n[91] Dans ses motifs concordants au paragraphe 52(1), le juge Stratas donne diff\u00e9rentes raisons de juger d\u00e9raisonnable la d\u00e9cision sur le fond de la Commission. Le juge Stratas examine l\u2019affirmation de CIC selon laquelle ses ressources \u00e9taient limit\u00e9es et devaient donc \u00eatre r\u00e9parties en fonction des diff\u00e9rents niveaux de d\u00e9pendance des deux groupes de membres de la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de leurs r\u00e9pondants canadiens. Non seulement il consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9claration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale fond\u00e9e sur des st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes, mais le juge Stratas estime que l\u2019explication souligne que, dans ce cas, \u00ab CIC a \u00e9tabli des distinctions fond\u00e9es sur la situation de famille \u00bb.\n[92] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec l\u2019argument selon lequel ces d\u00e9clarations dans l\u2019affaire Attaran-CAF lient cette formation dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur la question de savoir si certains ou tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du crit\u00e8re prima facie ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis. Bien que les d\u00e9cisions de la CAF soient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement contraignantes pour le Tribunal, dans l\u2019affaire Attaran-CAF, la CAF exer\u00e7ait un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de la Commission de rejeter la plainte et de ne pas la renvoyer devant le Tribunal. Dans ce contexte, les d\u00e9clarations de la CAF relatives aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments du test prima facie ne lient pas le Tribunal.\n[93] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur ce point. Dans le cadre du contr\u00f4le judiciaire, la CAF a \u00e9valu\u00e9 le caract\u00e8re raisonnable de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond de la Commission de ne pas renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal. Selon le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP, la Commission ne d\u00e9cide pas du bien-fond\u00e9 d\u2019une plainte. C\u2019est le r\u00f4le du Tribunal.\n[94] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9crit la nature de la d\u00e9cision sur le fond d\u2019une Commission des droits de la personne de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse de renvoyer une plainte au Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Halifax (Regional Municipality) c. Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (Human Rights Commission) (2012 CSC 10) (Halifax) au para. 19 :\n[\u2026] Lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9cide de confier l\u2019examen d\u2019une plainte \u00e0 une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate, la Commission ne conclut pas que la plainte tombe sous le coup de la Loi. Suivant le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif, la Commission est plut\u00f4t appel\u00e9e \u00e0 exercer des fonctions d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable et d\u2019administration. Elle peut notamment renvoyer la plainte \u00e0 une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate pour que cette derni\u00e8re tranche une question de comp\u00e9tence.\n[95] Cela est conforme \u00e0 la structure de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte en vertu de la LCDP et au fait que le Tribunal entend la preuve des t\u00e9moins et enregistre les pi\u00e8ces documentaires. Le Tribunal tire des conclusions de fait, d\u00e9termine la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 et d\u00e9cide en fin de compte du bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte sur la base du dossier dont il dispose. La Commission ne fait rien de tout cela.\n[96] Il serait contraire au r\u00e9gime de la LCDP et pr\u00e9judiciable aux parties de consid\u00e9rer que la d\u00e9cision de renvoi (et tout examen de cette d\u00e9cision) peut lier ou autrement entraver le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal de trancher sur le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte. Le dossier pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal n\u2019est pas le m\u00eame que celui pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e0 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et \u00e0 la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[97] En outre, certaines questions importantes soulev\u00e9es devant cette formation n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 abord\u00e9es par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ou la CAF. La question la plus notable est celle de savoir si la plainte concerne un service.\n[98] Pour les raisons qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, je consid\u00e8re que les conclusions du contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale et les commentaires de la CAF sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments du test prima facie, dont M. Attaran affirme qu\u2019ils lient le Tribunal, ne lient pas le Tribunal maintenant qu\u2019il examine le bien-fond\u00e9 de la plainte.\nXI. L\u00c9GISLATION SUR LA DISCRIMINATION ET FARDEAU DU PLAIGNANT [99] L\u2019objectif de la LCDP est de garantir le droit de tous les individus, dans la mesure compatible avec leurs devoirs et obligations au sein de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des chances d\u2019\u00e9panouissement et \u00e0 la prise de mesures visant \u00e0 la satisfaction de leurs besoins, ind\u00e9pendamment des consid\u00e9rations fond\u00e9es sur des motifs de discrimination illicites (article 2 de la LCDP).\n[100] Il est bien \u00e9tabli qu\u2019un plaignant doit s\u2019acquitter du fardeau de la preuve selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir une preuve suffisante (prima facie), qui \u00ab jusqu'\u00e0 preuve contraire est celle qui porte sur les all\u00e9gations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites et qui, si on leur ajoute foi, est compl\u00e8te et suffisante pour justifier un verdict en faveur de la plaignante, en l\u2019absence de r\u00e9plique de l\u2019employeur intim\u00e9 \u00bb. (Commission ontarienne des droits de la personne et O\u2019Malley c. Simpsons-Sears, [1985] 2 R.C.S. 536, p. 558).\n[101] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le plaignant est tenu de d\u00e9montrer :\nqu\u2019il poss\u00e9dait une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination en vertu de la LCDP; qu\u2019il a subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable dans le cadre de la prestation d\u2019un service par l\u2019intim\u00e9;\nque la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable (Moore c. Colombie\u2011Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61 (Moore), par. 33.).\n[102] Un intim\u00e9 peut soit pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour r\u00e9futer l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination prima facie, ce qui signifie qu\u2019aucune pratique discriminatoire n\u2019est \u00e9tablie, soit pr\u00e9senter un moyen de d\u00e9fense justifiant la pratique discriminatoire, soit faire les deux (voir Qu\u00e9bec (C.D.P.D.J.) c. Bombardier Inc. (A\u00e9ronautique Bombardier Centre de formation), 2015 CSC 39, au par. 64). Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9 r\u00e9fute l\u2019all\u00e9gation, son explication doit \u00eatre raisonnable. Il ne peut s\u2019agir d\u2019un pr\u00e9texte pour dissimuler la discrimination (Khiamal c. Canada, 2009 CF 495, par. 58).\nXII. TEST MOORE, PARTIE 1 : LE PLAIGNANT A \u00c9TABLI QU\u2019IL PR\u00c9SENTE UNE OU PLUSIEURS CARACT\u00c9RISTIQUES PROT\u00c9G\u00c9ES PAR LA LCDP\n[103] La plainte de M. Attaran all\u00e8gue une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la situation de famille, l\u2019\u00e2ge (de ses parents), la race et l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique (paragraphe 2 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant). Les arguments \u00e9crits de M. Attaran se sont concentr\u00e9s sur l\u2019\u00e2ge et la situation de famille, tandis que les arguments du CSALC se sont concentr\u00e9s sur la race et l\u2019origine nationale et ethnique. La Commission a approuv\u00e9 les arguments avanc\u00e9s par ces deux parties (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 58).\n[104] Les parties ne contestent pas le fait que M. Attaran a \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de des caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es par la LCDP.\n[105] La situation de famille et l\u2019\u00e2ge \u00e9taient les motifs de distinction illicite mentionn\u00e9s dans la plainte initiale. \u00c0 la suite d\u2019une requ\u00eate \u00e9crite, j\u2019ai autoris\u00e9 M. Attaran \u00e0 ajouter les motifs de distinction illicite de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique (voir 2017 TCDP 21). Apr\u00e8s avoir rendu cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de soumettre des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9s au d\u00e9but de 2019 pour refl\u00e9ter cette d\u00e9cision et une autre d\u00e9cision en faveur de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Bien qu\u2019il ait modifi\u00e9 certaines parties, M. Attaran n\u2019a pas modifi\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour inclure les deux motifs illicites suppl\u00e9mentaires autoris\u00e9s dans ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. Normalement, le fait de ne pas exposer un argument propos\u00e9 dans un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pourrait emp\u00eacher une partie de pr\u00e9senter cet argument lors de l\u2019audience ou dans les conclusions finales. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas adopt\u00e9 cette position en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et, en fait, l\u2019erreur \u00e9tait si \u00e9vidente que je consid\u00e8re qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un oubli de proc\u00e9dure. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019aborderai ci-dessous chacun des quatre motifs illicites all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\nA. Race et origine nationale ou ethnique [106] Les preuves ont \u00e9tabli que M. Attaran est n\u00e9 \u00e0 San Diego, en Californie, et il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019identifiait comme une minorit\u00e9 visible d\u2019origine iranienne et d\u2019ethnie persane. La preuve que ses parents, M. Kazem Attaran et Mme Nasrin Attaran, sont n\u00e9s en Iran et sont devenus citoyens des \u00c9tats-Unis d\u2019Am\u00e9rique apr\u00e8s s\u2019y \u00eatre install\u00e9s en 1962 pour poursuivre leurs \u00e9tudes, n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e. Je suis convaincu que M. Attaran pr\u00e9sente les caract\u00e9ristiques prot\u00e9g\u00e9es de la race et de l\u2019origine nationale et ethnique.\nB. Situation familiale\n[107] Le plaignant a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir deux enfants. Sa relation familiale avec ses parents et le fait qu\u2019il est parent et que ses parents sont \u00e2g\u00e9s sont au c\u0153ur de cette plainte. La LCDP ne d\u00e9finit pas le motif de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb, mais il est bien \u00e9tabli que la jurisprudence lui a donn\u00e9 une interpr\u00e9tation inclusive (voir le m\u00e9moire de la Commission, par. 60; B. c. Ontario (Commission des droits de la personne), 2002 CSC 66). La Commission consacre de longs arguments \u00e9crits pour expliquer pourquoi la situation familiale comprend la relation parent-enfant (et parent et grand-parent). Ce point n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[108] La situation de famille a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation large dans la jurisprudence de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Dans une d\u00e9cision sur le fond concernant la situation familiale, Johnstone c. l\u2019Agence des services frontaliers du Canada (2010 TCDP 20), le membre du Tribunal Findlay expose les raisons pour lesquelles les responsabilit\u00e9s de garde d\u2019enfants, du type et de la dur\u00e9e de celles v\u00e9cues par Mme Johnstone, sont incluses dans la notion de situation de famille.\n[109] Un plus petit nombre d\u2019affaires port\u00e9es devant le TCDP ont demand\u00e9 l\u2019inclusion de la relation entre un enfant adulte et un parent dans le cadre du motif de distinction illicite li\u00e9 \u00e0 la situation de famille. La question a \u00e9t\u00e9 examin\u00e9e par le membre Johnson dans l\u2019affaire Waddle c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique et Conf\u00e9rence ferroviaire de Teamsters Canada (2017 TCDP 24) (Waddle). En fin de compte, le membre Johnson n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 que le plaignant dans cette affaire avait apport\u00e9 suffisamment de preuves pour \u00e9tayer la plainte sur la base de ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de soins aux personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es envers ses parents. Toutefois, il a tenu compte de la d\u00e9cision ant\u00e9rieure du TCDP dans l\u2019affaire Hicks c. Ressources humaines et D\u00e9veloppement des comp\u00e9tences Canada (2013 TCDP 20) (Hicks). Dans Hicks, le membre du Tribunal a clairement indiqu\u00e9 que les obligations d\u2019un enfant envers un parent \u00e2g\u00e9 pouvaient \u00e9galement \u00eatre reconnues dans le contexte d\u2019une r\u00e9clamation relative \u00e0 la situation familiale (Hicks, par. 44). La conclusion du Tribunal sur ce point a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e lors d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Hicks, 2015 CF 599 au par. 66).\n[110] La Commission cite l\u2019affaire B. c. Ontario (cit\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment) \u00e0 l\u2019appui d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation large de l\u2019expression \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb. En outre, la Commission demande au Tribunal de prendre en consid\u00e9ration plusieurs instruments internationaux relatifs aux droits de la personne concernant la famille. L\u2019article 16 de la D\u00e9claration universelle des droits de l\u2019homme des Nations Unies, entre autres, stipule que \u00ab [l]a famille est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment naturel et fondamental de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et a droit \u00e0 la protection de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00c9tat \u00bb.\n[111] L\u2019article 10(1) du Pacte international relatif aux droits \u00e9conomiques, sociaux et culturels stipule que \u00ab [la] protection et [l\u2019]assistance aussi larges que possible doivent \u00eatre accord\u00e9es \u00e0 la famille, qui est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment naturel et fondamental de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, en particulier pour sa formation et aussi longtemps qu'elle a la responsabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019entretien et de l\u2019\u00e9ducation d\u2019enfants \u00e0 charge \u00bb.\n[112] La Commission cite \u00e9galement le Pacte international relatif aux droits civils et politiques qui reprend ces principes fondamentaux en stipulant que \u00ab [l]a famille est l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment naturel et fondamental de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et a droit \u00e0 la protection de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et de l\u2019\u00c9tat\".\n[113] Outre l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 des sexes, la Convention internationale sur l\u2019\u00e9limination de la discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des femmes vise en grande partie \u00e0 assurer l\u2019\u00e9quilibre entre le travail et la famille. \u00c0 cet effet, les articles 5, 11 et 16 visent \u00e0 permettre aux parents de combiner leurs obligations familiales avec leurs responsabilit\u00e9s professionnelles et leur participation \u00e0 la vie publique.\n[114] Enfin, la Commission fait valoir que l\u2019article 3 de la Convention relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant dispose que \u00ab dans toutes les d\u00e9cisions qui concernent les enfants (...) l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat sup\u00e9rieur de l\u2019enfant doit \u00eatre la consid\u00e9ration primordiale \u00bb. La Convention exige \u00e9galement que le Canada fournisse l\u2019assistance appropri\u00e9e aux parents et aux tuteurs pour qu\u2019ils puissent s\u2019acquitter de leurs responsabilit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9ducation des enfants, y compris toutes les mesures appropri\u00e9es pour faire en sorte que les enfants dont les parents travaillent aient le droit de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des services et \u00e9tablissements de garde d\u2019enfants auxquels ils peuvent pr\u00e9tendre. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait de compter sur les parents et les grands-parents pour la garde des enfants est une consid\u00e9ration pertinente selon la Commission.\n[115] Comme indiqu\u00e9, l\u2019argument final de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne conteste pas le fait que le motif de la situation de famille est invoqu\u00e9. Je suis persuad\u00e9 que le plaignant a \u00e9tabli la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e de la \u00ab situation de famille \u00bb en vertu de l\u2019article 3 de la LCDP.\nC. L\u2019\u00e2ge [116] M. Attaran fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019\u00e2ge (de ses parents) \u00bb dans ses observations. Les parents de M. Attaran ne sont pas parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Toutefois, pour cette premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape du test prima facie, le plaignant n\u2019a qu\u2019\u00e0 montrer qu\u2019il poss\u00e8de la caract\u00e9ristique. Il est un adulte d\u2019\u00e2ge m\u00fbr, dont les parents sont n\u00e9cessairement plus \u00e2g\u00e9s que lui. (Malheureusement, la m\u00e8re de M. Attaran est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e alors que les pr\u00e9sents motifs \u00e9taient en r\u00e9serve.)\n[117] J\u2019ai conclu que M. Attaran avait \u00e9tabli ces caract\u00e9ristiques, qui sont des motifs de distinction illicites, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s (article 3 de la LCDP) : la race, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la situation de famille et l\u2019\u00e2ge. La question de savoir si un ou plusieurs de ces motifs interdits ont jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans une pratique discriminatoire pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e rel\u00e8ve des \u00e9tapes suivantes du test prima facie.\nXIII. TEST MOORE, PARTIE 2 : LE PLAIGNANT A-T-IL \u00c9TABLI UNE DIFF\u00c9RENCE DE TRAITEMENT D\u00c9FAVORABLE DANS LA FOURNITURE D\u2019UN SERVICE PAR L\u2019INTIM\u00c9?\n[118] Pour appliquer l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP, il faut d\u00e9terminer si les actes reproch\u00e9s ont eu lieu \u00ab [dans le cadre de la fourniture] de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement \u00bb (voir Watkin c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2008 CAF 170 (Watkin) au par. 31.)\n[119] L\u2019article 5 de la LCDP est libell\u00e9 comme suit\n5. Constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, le fait, pour le fournisseur de biens, de services, d\u2019installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergement destin\u00e9s au public :\na) d\u2019en priver un individu;\nb) de le d\u00e9favoriser \u00e0 l\u2019occasion de leur fourniture.\n[120] Une question cl\u00e9 est donc de savoir si le traitement d\u00e9favorable, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, s\u2019est produit dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un service par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 cette question, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019identifier les actions gouvernementales qui sont cens\u00e9es \u00eatre le service. S\u2019il est \u00e9tabli qu\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable a eu lieu dans le cadre de la fourniture d\u2019un service, il convient de d\u00e9terminer si un motif illicite a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans ce traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[121] Le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer la caract\u00e9risation correcte du ou des services en question. Dans certaines affaires ant\u00e9rieures, le Tribunal a pu traiter cette question \u00e0 titre pr\u00e9liminaire. Cela serait utile lorsque le fait de traiter la question de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire pourrait \u00e9liminer compl\u00e8tement la plainte. Dans le cadre de la plainte, le plaignant et la Commission attaquent de nombreuses actions d\u2019IRCC, dont du ministre, et invoquent des effets n\u00e9gatifs g\u00e9n\u00e9raux et composites, notamment des d\u00e9lais trop longs et un nombre disproportionn\u00e9 de PGP approuv\u00e9s par rapport au nombre total de personnes qui demandent la r\u00e9sidence permanente au Canada. Le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 express\u00e9ment au Tribunal de ne pas \u00e9valuer certains types d\u2019actions gouvernementales qui influencent le traitement des demandes. La d\u00e9cision sur le fond doit donc examiner attentivement les mesures gouvernementales contest\u00e9es et identifier correctement le ou les services que le plaignant et la Commission ont mis en cause.\nA. LE(S) SERVICE(S) ALL\u00c9GU\u00c9(S) EN CAUSE ET NON EN CAUSE\n[122] Comme nous le verrons plus en d\u00e9tail ci-dessous, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis que, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le traitement des demandes d\u2019immigration par IRCC est un service rendu au public. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas d\u2019accord avec ce que le plaignant et la Commission ont inclus dans l\u2019expression \u00ab traitement des demandes \u00bb. Le plaignant et la Commission ont all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que des actions pr\u00e9sentant diverses caract\u00e9ristiques constituaient des pratiques discriminatoires. Les parties n\u2019\u00e9taient pas d\u2019accord pour dire que toutes les occurrences de traitement d\u00e9favorable all\u00e9gu\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9taient produites pendant le traitement des demandes de parrainage par IRCC ou d\u00e9coulaient de ce traitement.\n[123] Lorsque l\u2019on compare le traitement d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie de demandes d\u2019immigration \u00e0 une autre, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019examiner de plus pr\u00e8s les diff\u00e9rentes \u00e9tapes du traitement, et ce qui guide et contraint ces \u00e9tapes \u00e0 mesure que les demandes progressent dans le syst\u00e8me jusqu\u2019\u00e0 leur finalisation. Par cons\u00e9quent, il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019identifier les principaux types de mesures gouvernementales qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises, de d\u00e9terminer si elles sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des services par le plaignant et la Commission et, dans l\u2019affirmative, si elles correspondent \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition de \u00ab service \u00bb de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[124] Dans le cas des demandes de PGP, quatre \u00e9valuations de base doivent \u00eatre effectu\u00e9es : l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du r\u00e9pondant (partie 1 de la demande); l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 des membres de la famille parrain\u00e9s (partie 2 de la demande); les examens m\u00e9dicaux pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9; et les v\u00e9rifications des ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. Ces quatre \u00e9valuations sont r\u00e9gies par des lois et des r\u00e8glements qui, comme nous le verrons plus loin, n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9s par le plaignant et la Commission.\n[125] Le traitement des demandes est \u00e9galement guid\u00e9 et limit\u00e9 par d\u2019autres facteurs, dont les plans des niveaux et les instructions minist\u00e9rielles. Le plaignant et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019examiner le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019immigration lors du traitement des demandes, en tenant compte des dispositions de la LIPR et de son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application, ainsi que des fourchettes cibles pr\u00e9cis\u00e9es chaque ann\u00e9e par le Cabinet dans le plan des niveaux. L\u2019importance du plan des niveaux a \u00e9t\u00e9 fortement contest\u00e9e dans le cadre de cette enqu\u00eate, comme nous le verrons plus loin.\n[126] Les parties font \u00e9galement des all\u00e9gations concernant les instructions minist\u00e9rielles, qui sont \u00e9galement examin\u00e9es plus loin.\n[127] En outre, le plaignant all\u00e8gue que le ministre aurait d\u00fb utiliser les pouvoirs d\u2019exemption pr\u00e9vus par la loi pour \u00e9liminer les disparit\u00e9s li\u00e9es \u00e0 un motif de distinction illicite.\n[128] Il est important de d\u00e9terminer ce qui relevait de l\u2019autorit\u00e9 d\u2019IRCC et ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impos\u00e9 par d\u2019autres actions gouvernementales qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme des \u00ab services \u00bb par le plaignant et la Commission, \u00e0 qui incombe le fardeau de la preuve \u00e0 ce stade. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il serait trop large et superficiel d\u2019affirmer que, parce qu\u2019IRCC traite les demandes, tout effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur un groupe de demandeurs li\u00e9 \u00e0 un motif illicite doit d\u00e9couler d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire mise en \u0153uvre par IRCC.\n[129] Les sections suivantes \u00e9valuent ces diff\u00e9rents \u00e9l\u00e9ments et leur impact sur le traitement global des demandes. L\u2019examen minutieux de tous ces facteurs est n\u00e9cessaire pour r\u00e9soudre cette plainte.\nB. L\u2019INTIM\u00c9 N\u2019A PAS RECONNU QUE SES ACTIONS DANS LE CADRE DU TRAITEMENT DE LA DEMANDE DE M. ATTARAN CONSTITUENT UN \u00ab SERVICE \u00bb AU SENS DE LA LCDP.\n[130] La question du \u00ab service \u00bb ne peut pas \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 comme ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab reconnue \u00bb par l\u2019intim\u00e9, comme M. Attaran a exhort\u00e9 le Tribunal \u00e0 le faire. M. Attaran a fait valoir que les parties s\u2019entendent pour dire que le traitement des demandes par IRCC est un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, par. 13 et 14; m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant, par. 73) Dans les deux m\u00e9moires, M. Attaran affirme que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 l\u2019a reconnu dans l\u2019\u00e9change suivant :\n[Traduction]\nPr\u00e9sident Thomas, le probl\u00e8me ici est que, bien s\u00fbr, le Tribunal est saisi d\u2019une question juridique sur ce qui est un service et ce qui ne l\u2019est pas. C\u2019est donc la port\u00e9e de la question. Je tiens \u00e0 pr\u00e9ciser que nous ne contestons pas le fait que le traitement d\u2019une demande est un service, en effet. Mais vous savez, ce n\u2019est pas ce que nous, ce qui est en cause. (M. Stynes sur l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019audience, le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e0 02:36:25.)\n[131] Le plaignant soutient que, puisque toutes les parties conviennent que le traitement des demandes est un service, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas besoin de se pencher davantage sur la question et devrait trancher l\u2019affaire sur cette base (voir le m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant, paragraphe 73).\n[132] L\u2019argument de la Commission est \u00e9troitement li\u00e9 \u00e0 celui selon lequel la terminologie utilis\u00e9e par IRCC reconna\u00eet que le traitement est un service. Elle souligne les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve o\u00f9 figurent des expressions telles que \u00ab unit\u00e9 du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le \u00bb, \u00ab clients \u00bb et \u00ab services d\u2019immigration \u00bb, lesquelles indiqueraient que le traitement des demandes par IRCC doit \u00eatre un service au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\n[133] \u00c0 ce sujet, le plaignant ajoute que dans l\u2019obiter du juge No\u00ebl dans l\u2019affaire Watkin au par. 31, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9crit qu\u2019\u00ab Immigration Canada fournit un service \u00bb en ce qui concerne l\u2019acquisition de la r\u00e9sidence permanente (m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant, par. 76). Il ajoute qu\u2019en prenant cela au pied de la lettre, les \u00ab services d\u2019immigration \u00bb sont un service.\n[134] Je consid\u00e8re que l\u2019argument initial du plaignant selon lequel l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait reconnu que le traitement est un service n\u2019est pas convaincant. Dans son contexte, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas reconnu une telle chose. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a reconnu que l\u2019examen des demandes de parrainage par un agent d\u2019IRCC peut \u00eatre un \u00ab service \u00bb, mais il soutient que le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019IRCC s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire en fournissant le service de traitement des demandes. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a particuli\u00e8rement fait valoir que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles et les plans des niveaux ne sont pas un service. La reconnaissance par l\u2019intim\u00e9 du fait que IRCC fournit un service lors du traitement des demandes n\u2019incluait pas l\u2019\u00e9mission par le ministre d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles ou l\u2019approbation par le Cabinet des plans de niveaux comme des sous-composantes du \u00ab traitement \u00bb.\n[135] Parmi l\u2019ensemble des mesures discriminatoires qu\u2019IRCC aurait prises, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que la v\u00e9ritable source des retards dans le traitement des demandes dans le cadre de cette plainte \u00e9tait les plans des niveaux, qui \u00e9taient \u00e0 l\u2019origine du temps d\u2019attente de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement fait valoir que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne sont pas un service et que le plaignant et la Commission ont attaqu\u00e9 indirectement le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, qui, selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, n\u2019est pas un \u00ab service \u00bb. Il serait malavis\u00e9 de ne pas tenir compte des arguments de fond de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur une question d\u2019une importance capitale pour la pr\u00e9sente affaire, en se fondant sur une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation de ce qu\u2019il a reconnu.\n[136] De m\u00eame, je n\u2019accepte pas que des termes g\u00e9n\u00e9riques figurant dans des documents internes ou publics tels que \u00ab traitement \u00bb, \u00ab services aux clients \u00bb et \u00ab services d\u2019immigration \u00bb permettent de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Un argument s\u00e9mantique ne peut pas remplacer une analyse sobre n\u00e9cessaire bas\u00e9e sur les faits et le contexte particuliers de l\u2019affaire.\n[137] J\u2019ajouterai, en ce qui concerne la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence du plaignant dans l\u2019obiter du juge No\u00ebl dans l\u2019affaire Watkin, que la citation compl\u00e8te est la suivante : \u00ab Immigration Canada fournit un service lorsqu\u2019elle informe les immigrants sur la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour devenir un r\u00e9sident canadien \u00bb. (Watkin, paragraphe 28, soulignement ajout\u00e9). L\u2019exemple du juge No\u00ebl \u00e9tait conditionnel \u00e0 la sp\u00e9cificit\u00e9 de son \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00ab lorsque \u00bb qui renvoyait aux conseils offerts au public. Cette br\u00e8ve d\u00e9claration en obiter ne devrait pas \u00eatre gonfl\u00e9e au point de lier le Tribunal dans toute enqu\u00eate ult\u00e9rieure sur tout ce qui a trait \u00e0 la prestation de services par IRCC.\n[138] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate avant l\u2019audience en novembre 2018 visant \u00e0 modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions pour ajouter un argument juridique, qui n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 auparavant, selon lequel la pr\u00e9sente plainte n\u2019implique pas un \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Nonobstant les huit contre-arguments avanc\u00e9s par M. Attaran (la Commission n\u2019a pas pris position), j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 la requ\u00eate (voir 2019 TCDP 12.) Il s\u2019agit clairement d\u2019un argument fondamental que l\u2019intim\u00e9 souhaite soulever et il ne serait pas appropri\u00e9 de le rejeter sur une base superficielle.\n[139] Par cons\u00e9quent, pour d\u00e9terminer si le plaignant s\u2019est acquitt\u00e9 de la charge d\u2019\u00e9tablir une discrimination prima facie, les pr\u00e9sents motifs doivent d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019un des actes discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s s\u2019est produit dans le cadre de la prestation d\u2019un service par l\u2019intim\u00e9, au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\nC. L\u00c9GISLATION CONCERNANT LES \u00ab SERVICES \u00bb\n[140] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a examin\u00e9 le terme \u00ab services \u00bb dans l\u2019affaire Gould c. Yukon Order of Pioneers (1996 1 R.C.S. 571) (Gould). Cette affaire concernait le refus d\u2019admettre Mme Gould dans l\u2019ordre fraternel Yukon Order of Pioneers. La question principale dans l\u2019affaire Gould \u00e9tait de savoir si l\u2019adh\u00e9sion \u00e0 l\u2019ordre fraternel \u00e9tait offerte au \u00ab public \u00bb. La Cour a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [u]ne relation publique est donc requise entre le fournisseur du service et le b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaire de ce service dans la mesure o\u00f9 le public doit se voir accorder l\u2019acc\u00e8s ou l\u2019admission, ou offrir le service par le fournisseur \u00bb (voir le paragraphe 55 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould).\n[141] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Gould qu\u2019il existe une \u00ab connotation transitive \u00bb \u00e0 la conclusion d\u2019un service, dans laquelle un avantage doit \u00eatre offert au public. \u00ab [C]e n\u2019est qu\u2019une fois que le service, le logement, l'installation, etc., passe par le fournisseur et qu\u2019il est mis \u00e0 la disposition du public qu\u2019il est vis\u00e9 par l'interdiction de la discrimination \u00bb (paragraphe 55 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould).\n[142] Avant l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin, un courant jurisprudentiel soutenait que pratiquement tout ce qui \u00e9tait fait par le gouvernement \u00e9tait un \u00ab service \u00bb (Watkin, par. 24 \u00e0 31). Dans l\u2019affaire Watkin, la CAF a clairement \u00ab d\u00e9savou\u00e9 \u00bb cette notion et a apport\u00e9 plus de pr\u00e9cision \u00e0 l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation du mot \u00ab services \u00bb \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP (Ibid., par. 32). La CAF a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que le fait que les mesures gouvernementales soient prises dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et pour le bien public n\u2019en fait pas des \u00ab services \u00bb (paragraphes 22 et 33).\n[143] Des \u00e9claircissements suppl\u00e9mentaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision de 2018 de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019affaire Canada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2018 CSC 31, (Matson\/Andrews), lorsque la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 deux d\u00e9cisions du TCDP et la jurisprudence sur l\u2019article 5 applicable \u00e0 ce contexte. \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews, il existe une jurisprudence claire qui lie le Tribunal (en plus de l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin) : Forward et Forward c. Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration Canada, 2008 TCDP 5 (Forward), Alliance de la fonction publique du Canada et autres c. Agence du revenu du Canada et autres, 2012 CAF 7, demande d\u2019autorisation d\u2019appel refus\u00e9e, (CSC) 2012 CanLII 68761 (Murphy) et l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews. Je traiterai de chacune d\u2019elles \u00e0 tour de r\u00f4le ainsi que des affaires Andrews et autres c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2013 TCDP 21 (Andrews) et Matson et autres c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, (2013 TCDP 13 (Matson).\n[144] Dans l\u2019affaire Forward, deux fr\u00e8res se sont vu refuser la citoyennet\u00e9 et les plaignants et la Commission ont fait valoir que le service en cause \u00e9tait l\u2019examen des demandes de citoyennet\u00e9. L\u2019ancien pr\u00e9sident du Tribunal, Grant Sinclair, n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 cette qualification de la plainte. Il a estim\u00e9 que les preuves et les arguments ne portaient pas sur la conduite des fonctionnaires minist\u00e9riels, l\u2019exercice de leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ou la mise en \u0153uvre des politiques et pratiques minist\u00e9rielles. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 sur requ\u00eate que la seule source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e \u00e9tait le langage l\u00e9gislatif de la Loi sur la citoyennet\u00e9 de 1977. (Forward, aux paragraphes 36 \u00e0 38.) La l\u00e9gislation en elle-m\u00eame ne rel\u00e8ve pas de la LCDP. Cette conclusion a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale dans l\u2019affaire Murphy.\n[145] Dans la d\u00e9cision sur le fond rendue par le Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Murphy, 2010 TCDP 9, le plaignant et la Commission ont fait valoir que lorsque l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada (ARC) \u00e9tablit une cotisation pour les imp\u00f4ts \u00e0 payer, elle fournit un service. Ils ont apport\u00e9 la preuve que les contribuables sont appel\u00e9s \u00ab clients \u00bb et ont \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 les actions que le personnel de l\u2019ARC accomplit pour fournir des conseils qui peuvent b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier \u00e0 un contribuable. Le plaignant a fait valoir que des actions telles que l\u2019introduction de donn\u00e9es dans un syst\u00e8me d\u2019information et la s\u00e9lection des candidats entraient dans la d\u00e9finition d\u2019un \u00ab service destin\u00e9 au public \u00bb (paragraphes 45 et 46). La Commission a estim\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9valuation de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu \u00e9tait un service parce que l\u2019assistance aux contribuables est un avantage offert au grand public (paragraphe 49).\n[146] Une fois de plus, cette caract\u00e9risation a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le Tribunal. Le vice-pr\u00e9sident Hadjis a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que \u00ab [m]\u00eame si les t\u00e2ches entreprises par l\u2019ARC lors du traitement de demandes pour l\u2019application du m\u00e9canisme de PFRA constituent un service, elles ne sont pas le fondement de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement all\u00e9gu\u00e9e dans la plainte. La pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a comme seule origine le libell\u00e9 \u00bb. La l\u00e9gislation contest\u00e9e \u00e9tait la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu (Ibid. au paragraphe 54).\n[147] La Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a confirm\u00e9 cette d\u00e9cision sur le fond, estimant que les plaintes visant la l\u00e9gislation, et rien d\u2019autre, n\u2019entrent pas dans le champ d\u2019application de la LCDP. Le recours appropri\u00e9 est une contestation constitutionnelle.\n[148] Puis vint l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews. Puisque la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a concentr\u00e9 son analyse sur le principe de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence et la norme de contr\u00f4le, il est n\u00e9cessaire de revoir le raisonnement sur les dispositions de l\u2019article 5 dans les d\u00e9cisions de premi\u00e8re instance.\n[149] Dans l\u2019affaire Matson, le Tribunal a commenc\u00e9 son analyse de l\u2019article 5 en caract\u00e9risant les actions gouvernementales contest\u00e9es. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 si la contestation portait v\u00e9ritablement sur le traitement de la demande d\u2019enregistrement du plaignant en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens ou sur autre chose. Le membre Lustig a jug\u00e9 que le traitement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas v\u00e9ritablement contest\u00e9. Au contraire, \u00ab [l]\u2019unique source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 6 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\u00bb (Matson, par. 59). Pour parvenir \u00e0 cette conclusion, le Tribunal s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin : \u00ab (...) la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape \u00e0 franchir lorsqu\u2019on applique l\u2019article 5 consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si les actes reproch\u00e9s constituent des \u2018\u2019services\u2019\u2019 \u00bb (voir Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, par le juge La Forest, par. 60).\n[150] Dans l\u2019affaire Matson, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que la contestation portait v\u00e9ritablement sur la l\u00e9gislation et rien d\u2019autre. Les parties \u00e9tant en d\u00e9saccord sur la nature de l\u2019affaire, le Tribunal a choisi de pr\u00e9ciser les actions comme point de d\u00e9part.\n[151] Le juge Lustig a reconnu la proposition g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019arr\u00eat Watkin selon laquelle les \u00ab [...] \u2018\u2019services\u2019\u2019 s\u2019entendent de quelque chose d\u2019avantageux qui est \u2018\u2019offert\u2019\u2019 ou \u2018\u2019mis \u00e0 la disposition\u2019\u2019 du public \u00bb (Watkin, par. 31). Toutefois, le membre Lustig a conclu que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le minist\u00e8re intim\u00e9 qui offrait au public l\u2019avantage du droit \u00e0 l\u2019inscription en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens. C\u2019est la Loi sur les Indiens qui offre cet avantage : \u00ab [c]e que ce dernier peut offrir en tant qu\u2019avantage ou service au public est le traitement des demandes d\u2019inscription en vue de d\u00e9terminer si une personne doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e au registre des Indiens, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Loi sur les Indiens \u00bb (Matson, par. 58). Dans ce cas, le traitement d\u2019une demande par un agent du registre, d\u00e9crit comme l\u2019examen des demandes, aurait pu \u00eatre un service, mais le statut qui en r\u00e9sulte ou l\u2019absence de statut n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le service offert par le minist\u00e8re effectuant le traitement conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la Loi sur les Indiens, et l\u2019acte consistant \u00e0 l\u00e9gif\u00e9rer sur ces exigences n\u2019\u00e9tait pas non plus un service.\n[152] Dans l\u2019affaire Andrews, la Commission et la partie plaignante ont de nouveau soutenu que le traitement de l\u2019inscription en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens \u00e9tait un service. Elle a d\u2019abord fait valoir que Service Canada pr\u00e9sentait l\u2019inscription comme un service sur son site Web (Andrews, par. 43). Ensuite, la Commission a analys\u00e9 les avantages que procure l\u2019inscription en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens pour faire valoir qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un service.\n[153] Dans cette affaire, la Commission a fait valoir que l\u2019enregistrement en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res utilis\u00e9s pour d\u00e9terminer si une activit\u00e9 gouvernementale pouvait \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9e de service. Ces indices comprennent des avantages tangibles et intangibles, des avantages offerts \u00e0 un public admissible et des personnes qui soumettent des demandes au registre des Indiens pour que ces avantages soient conf\u00e9r\u00e9s (Andrews, paragraphe 45).\n[154] Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne consid\u00e8re pas le droit \u00e0 l\u2019enregistrement en vertu de la Loi sur les Indiens comme un \u00ab service \u00bb. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a admis que le traitement d\u2019une demande d\u2019enregistrement pouvait constituer un \u00ab service \u00bb, mais il a fait valoir que les crit\u00e8res \u00e9tablis par le l\u00e9gislateur pour d\u00e9terminer qui est \u00e9ligible ne constituaient pas un service. En d\u2019autres termes, si la demande avait \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une distinction sur la base d\u2019un motif illicite d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui s\u2019\u00e9carte des crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatifs, il aurait pu s\u2019agir d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire, mais le simple fait d\u2019appliquer les crit\u00e8res l\u00e9gislatifs ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas.\n[155] Le Tribunal a conclu que le statut d\u2019Indien conf\u00e9rait des avantages tangibles et intangibles au public. Toutefois, bien que le minist\u00e8re des Affaires autochtones et du D\u00e9veloppement du Nord Canada (comme il s\u2019appelait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque) puisse \u00eatre un prestataire de services, fournissant un service au public, les services fournis par le minist\u00e8re n\u2019\u00e9taient pas, en fin de compte, l\u2019objet de la plainte. Le Tribunal a qualifi\u00e9 la v\u00e9ritable contestation de contestation de la Loi sur les Indiens elle-m\u00eame.\n[156] Dans ce cas, il serait trop large et superficiel d\u2019affirmer que les d\u00e9lais de traitement ou les services d\u2019immigration en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sont un \u00ab service \u00bb au sens de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Compte tenu de l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews et de la jurisprudence qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 ces d\u00e9cisions, l\u2019approche appropri\u00e9e consiste \u00e0 analyser si les mesures gouvernementales sp\u00e9cifiques qui ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 allonger les d\u00e9lais de traitement pour la cat\u00e9gorie des PGP sont vis\u00e9es par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 5b) de la LCDP.\nD. LA LIPR ET LE R\u00c8GLEMENT DE LA LIPR NE SONT PAS CENS\u00c9S \u00caTRE DES SERVICES\n[157] Dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte, il n\u2019est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019adoption de lois par le Parlement constitue une pratique discriminatoire, pas plus que l\u2019adoption de r\u00e8glements par le Cabinet ne constitue une pratique discriminatoire. Le plaignant et la Commission, \u00e0 qui il incombe d\u2019\u00e9tablir la preuve prima facie, ont express\u00e9ment demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de ne pas d\u00e9terminer si l\u2019adoption des r\u00e8glements et les approbations finales des plans sont des \u00ab services \u00bb au sens de la LCDP et de se concentrer plut\u00f4t sur le traitement par IRCC en tant que service contest\u00e9. Aucune partie n\u2019a attaqu\u00e9 directement la LIPR (conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews) et aucune partie n\u2019a attaqu\u00e9 directement le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. Le plaignant a fait valoir ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLa question de savoir si le ratio dans les arr\u00eats Matson et Andrews immunise contre le contr\u00f4le du Tribunal la l\u00e9gislation subordonn\u00e9e telle que le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, par opposition aux lois du Parlement telle que la LIPR elle-m\u00eame, reste ouverte. Cette question juridique n\u2019a pas besoin d\u2019\u00eatre tranch\u00e9e en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et ne devrait pas l\u2019\u00eatre \u2013 c\u2019est pourquoi le plaignant ne prend pas actuellement position \u00e0 ce sujet. (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, paragraphe 171, soulign\u00e9 dans la version originale).\n[158] La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[Traduction]\nLa plainte de M. Attaran ne vise pas la l\u00e9gislation. Sa plainte n\u2019indique pas qu\u2019un texte de loi est discriminatoire, mais plut\u00f4t que la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 traite les dossiers des conjoints et des enfants \u00e0 un rythme beaucoup plus rapide que ceux des parents et des grands-parents est discriminatoire. (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 55).\n[159] Dans la mesure o\u00f9 la LIPR et son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application imposent \u00e0 IRCC un traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9 sur des motifs illicites entre diff\u00e9rents types de demandeurs, ce type de traitement d\u00e9favorable n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 poursuivi en tant qu\u2019acte discriminatoire en vertu de la LCDP par le plaignant et la Commission. Au lieu de cela, le plaignant et la CCDP ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019examiner de tr\u00e8s pr\u00e8s les proc\u00e9dures, les processus et les r\u00e9sultats d\u2019IRCC, y compris le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre de donner des instructions minist\u00e9rielles qui orientent le traitement des demandes par les fonctionnaires d\u2019IRCC, la mise en \u0153uvre des plans des niveaux et l\u2019octroi aux demandeurs de d\u00e9rogations \u00e0 \u00ab tout ou partie des crit\u00e8res et obligations applicables \u00bb (paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR).\n[160] Par cons\u00e9quent, si le Tribunal d\u00e9termine que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contraignants et obligatoires de la LIPR et de son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application sont les causes in\u00e9vitables du traitement d\u00e9favorable attribu\u00e9 par le plaignant ou la Commission \u00e0 IRCC, le plaignant et la Commission ne se seront pas acquitt\u00e9s de la charge qui leur incombe d\u2019\u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de la part d\u2019IRCC dans le cadre du traitement des demandes. Pour les m\u00eames raisons, la question de savoir si la r\u00e9glementation est un service ne sera pas tranch\u00e9e dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs. Ces questions ne sont pas \u00e0 proprement parler devant le Tribunal, comme le soutiennent le plaignant et la Commission. La question cl\u00e9 devant le Tribunal est plut\u00f4t de savoir si, \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de la port\u00e9e des actions gouvernementales laiss\u00e9es \u00e0 IRCC, dans un r\u00e9gime qui comprend la LIPR et le r\u00e8glement de la LIPR, IRCC s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire.\n[161] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur la LIPR, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme faisant partie du cadre l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e9glementaire dans lequel l\u2019intim\u00e9 traite les demandes.\nE. L\u2019IMPORTANCE DES PLANS DE NIVEAUX DANS CETTE ENQU\u00caTE\n[162] Les parties ont adopt\u00e9 des points de vue divergents sur l\u2019importance des plans de niveaux et ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations d\u00e9taill\u00e9es \u00e0 ce sujet. De nombreux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal lors de l\u2019audience sur la mani\u00e8re dont les plans de niveaux sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9s et sur la question de savoir si c\u2019est l\u2019intim\u00e9 ou le Cabinet qui d\u00e9cide des nombres figurant dans les plans de niveaux chaque ann\u00e9e.\n[163] Tout au long de l\u2019enqu\u00eate, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 que le long d\u00e9lai de traitement pour le sous-groupe des PGP, subi par la famille Attaran, \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat direct du fait que les plans des niveaux avaient des fourchettes d\u2019objectifs d\u2019admission pour les PGP qui \u00e9taient constamment trop basses pour emp\u00eacher l\u2019apparition d\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9s. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9, la source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ne se trouve pas dans l\u2019\u00e9valuation de la demande de parrainage, mais plut\u00f4t dans le nombre de places de r\u00e9sidents permanents disponibles dans le cadre du plan des niveaux par rapport \u00e0 la demande, ann\u00e9e apr\u00e8s ann\u00e9e (m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux paragraphes 2 et 3). Ils ont expliqu\u00e9 que le plan des niveaux fixait le nombre d\u2019admissions pour les PGP chaque ann\u00e9e et qu\u2019une fois ce nombre atteint, les demandes de parrainage restantes restaient en attente jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019une place se lib\u00e8re l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. IRCC ne pouvait pas approuver beaucoup plus de demandes de PGP parce que le plan des niveaux ne lui en donnait pas le pouvoir. (Voir l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux paragraphes 38 et 39.)\n[164] Avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, M. Attaran a critiqu\u00e9 le plan des niveaux et son incidence sur le temps de traitement de sa demande. Le paragraphe 4 de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions se lit comme suit :\n[Traduction]\nLa cause du probl\u00e8me est assez simple : les gouvernements successifs ont, environ une fois par an, publi\u00e9 des \u00ab plans de niveaux \u00bb de l\u2019immigration qui rel\u00e8guent les demandes de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale pour les parents et les grands-parents \u00e0 la fin de la file d\u2019attente. Le minist\u00e8re intim\u00e9, s\u2019exprimant au nom du ministre de l\u2019Immigration, affirme qu\u2019il dispose d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire lui permettant de classer les demandes par ordre de priorit\u00e9, ce qui est vrai, mais il n\u00e9glige le fait que lorsque le Parlement a accord\u00e9 ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, il a stipul\u00e9 dans la Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s (LIPR) et dans la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP) qu\u2019il ne devait jamais \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 \u00e0 des fins discriminatoires \u2013 ce qui est le cas.\n[165] Bien que M. Attaran ait soulign\u00e9 l\u2019influence des plans de niveaux sur la r\u00e9duction du nombre de places d\u2019admission pour les PGP et, par cons\u00e9quent, sur l\u2019allongement des d\u00e9lais de traitement, son objectif \u00e9tait et reste les pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires du ministre. \u00c0 la fin de l\u2019audience, M. Attaran affirme que son affaire n\u2019a jamais port\u00e9 sur la discrimination dans la mani\u00e8re dont le Cabinet \u00e9tablit son plan de niveaux et qu\u2019il n\u2019a jamais exig\u00e9 du Cabinet qu\u2019il augmente ou diminue ses chiffres : [Traduction] \u00ab Mais nulle part dans les preuves orales ou \u00e9crites le plaignant n\u2019a demand\u00e9 au Cabinet d\u2019augmenter le niveau d\u2019admission des PGP, et nulle part dans les plaidoiries le plaignant n\u2019a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que le Cabinet avait fait preuve de discrimination en ne le faisant pas \u00bb. Il d\u00e9clare \u00e9galement que : [Traduction] \u00ab [...] en plaidant comme si l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du plan des niveaux \u00e9tait le \u2018\u2019service\u2019\u2019 discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 se trouve dans une galaxie tr\u00e8s, tr\u00e8s lointaine \u00bb. (par. 114 \u00e0 117 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant, soulign\u00e9 dans l\u2019original.)\n[166] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que M. Attaran a modifi\u00e9 son argumentation :\n[Traduction]\nApr\u00e8s avoir affirm\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions que la \u00ab cause du probl\u00e8me est [...] les \u2018\u2019plans de niveaux\u2019\u2019 \u00bb, le plaignant a maintenant chang\u00e9 de position et affirme dans ses conclusions finales que la source de la discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e est l\u2019absence all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de r\u00e9formes l\u00e9gislatives et politiques visant \u00e0 contr\u00f4ler plus t\u00f4t la demande de parrainage de PGP. (M\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, paragraphe 7)\n[167] Comme il ressort de ces \u00e9changes, les parties sont fondamentalement en d\u00e9saccord sur la question de savoir si les plans de niveaux d\u00e9terminent les temps d\u2019attente et imposent une diff\u00e9renciation d\u00e9favorable entre les demandeurs pour des motifs interdits, ou si le ministre aurait pu am\u00e9liorer le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9 aux demandeurs de la cat\u00e9gorie PGP gr\u00e2ce aux pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires pr\u00e9vus par la LIPR, de sorte que les demandeurs de la cat\u00e9gorie PGP auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 sur un pied d\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 avec d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories de demandeurs, tels que les FC1.\n[168] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait essentiel de trouver la cause des retards subis par les demandeurs de PGP :\n[Traduction]\nLe probl\u00e8me dans cette affaire \u00e9tait le temps d\u2019attente avant que sa demande puisse \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e par un agent d\u2019immigration. La t\u00e2che essentielle du Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est de d\u00e9terminer la cause de ce temps d\u2019attente. (M\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, paragraphe 6)\n[169] Pour \u00e9tayer davantage l\u2019opinion selon laquelle le service ou les services sur lesquels le plaignant demande au Tribunal de statuer ne comprennent pas l\u2019approbation des plans de niveaux par le Cabinet, les mesures correctives demand\u00e9es dans le m\u00e9moire de M. Attaran ne portent pas sur les plans de niveaux. Les cinq principales mesures correctives non p\u00e9cuniaires demand\u00e9es par M. Attaran sont les suivantes : r\u00e9forme prospective des normes de service; transparence statistique; \u00e9galit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle; responsabilit\u00e9 publique; et inclusion d\u2019un m\u00e9canisme de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour les situations d\u2019urgence o\u00f9 l\u2019\u00e9galit\u00e9 op\u00e9rationnelle ne peut \u00eatre respect\u00e9e. Toutes ces mesures concernent le d\u00e9lai d\u2019attente pour l\u2019examen des demandes lorsque le dossier est activement trait\u00e9 par un agent d\u2019IRCC. Les mesures correctives demand\u00e9es ne concernent pas les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs des plans de niveaux, l\u2019\u00e9laboration des plans de niveaux ou le probl\u00e8me des demandes qui \u00ab restent dormantes sur une tablette \u00bb pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes. (Les preuves pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au Tribunal ont montr\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours des derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, apr\u00e8s la finalisation de la demande de la famille Attaran, le probl\u00e8me des demandes \u00ab en attente \u00bb pendant de longues p\u00e9riodes a disparu en raison des contr\u00f4les stricts de r\u00e9ception des demandes). Cela confirme le point de vue selon lequel le plaignant conteste le traitement des demandes par l\u2019intim\u00e9 et les pouvoirs discr\u00e9tionnaires du ministre que le plaignant consid\u00e8re comme faisant partie de ce traitement, et non pas les plans de niveaux.\n[170] La Commission n\u2019a pas non plus all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que l\u2019approbation des plans de niveaux par le Cabinet \u00e9tait un service. La position de la Commission sur les plans de niveaux est difficile \u00e0 suivre. Selon la Commission, [Traduction] \u00ab le plan de classement et le traitement de la demande sont inextricablement li\u00e9s l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre. Le plan de niveaux constitue la fourniture du service et fait donc partie int\u00e9grante de la cha\u00eene d\u2019approvisionnement pour la fourniture du service \u00bb. Cependant, la Commission d\u00e9clare \u00e9galement que les plans de niveaux ne sont pas \u00ab pertinents \u00bb et que la source de la p\u00e9nurie d\u2019approvisionnement n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance, soulignant \u00e0 nouveau que cette plainte attaque le traitement en aval des demandes, et non les plans de niveaux (paragraphe 47 du m\u00e9moire de la Commission).\n[171] Nonobstant les arguments finaux de la plaignante et de la Commission qui n\u2019attaquent pas les plans de niveaux, une grande partie des preuves pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience et une grande partie de la plaidoirie finale ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consacr\u00e9es au processus d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des plans de niveaux, \u00e0 leur importance et au pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire qui existe, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, autour de leur mise en \u0153uvre. Ainsi, pour conclure si IRCC s\u2019est livr\u00e9e \u00e0 des pratiques discriminatoires, il faut proc\u00e9der \u00e0 un examen d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des plans de niveaux dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime d\u2019immigration.\n[172] Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, le paragraphe 94(1) de la LIPR exige que le ministre d\u00e9pose devant le Parlement un rapport annuel sur l\u2019application de la LIPR. Les d\u00e9tails du rapport annuel sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s au paragraphe 94(2), dont l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(2)b) qui demande une description du nombre d\u2019\u00e9trangers qui sont devenus des r\u00e9sidents permanents et du nombre de ceux qui devraient le devenir au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e suivante. Cette description au titre de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 94(2)b), qui fait partie du rapport annuel au Parlement, est un rapport au Parlement sur le plan des niveaux, dont d\u00e9pendent beaucoup de choses. Bien que, comme le souligne M. Attaran, les mots \u00ab plan de niveaux \u00bb n\u2019apparaissent pas dans la l\u00e9gislation.\n[173] Il est exact que ni la LIPR ni le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR n\u2019utilisent l\u2019expression \u00ab plan des niveaux \u00bb, ce qui est int\u00e9ressant, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie apparemment sur le plan des niveaux pour expliquer comment les ressources sont allou\u00e9es par IRCC afin d\u2019atteindre les objectifs du gouvernement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration. Les preuves documentaires pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience ont \u00e9galement montr\u00e9 que le gouvernement n\u2019\u00e9tait pas coh\u00e9rent dans la mani\u00e8re dont le plan des niveaux \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans les diff\u00e9rents rapports annuels. Tous les rapports annuels au Parlement pour les ann\u00e9es 2008 \u00e0 2020 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme preuves lors de l\u2019audience. Seuls les rapports de 2009 et 2010 fixent les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs pour les diff\u00e9rentes sous-cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants, dont les PGP. \u00c0 partir de 2011, les rapports annuels n\u2019ont pas ventil\u00e9 les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs prospectifs pour les sous-cat\u00e9gories telles que les PGP et les FC1. La plupart du temps, une fourchette cible \u00e9tait indiqu\u00e9e pour toutes les s\u00e9lections approuv\u00e9es par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, dont les cat\u00e9gories \u00e9conomiques, toutes les cat\u00e9gories familiales et les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s. Les immigrants devant \u00eatre s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s dans le cadre du programme d\u2019immigration unique du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e9taient g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment, une fourchette cible globale \u00e9tant donn\u00e9e pour tous les immigrants de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir.\n[174] Au cours du contre-interrogatoire de M. Attaran, M. Bornais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame si les fourchettes cibles n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ventil\u00e9es en sous-cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants dans les rapports annuels \u00e0 partir de 2011, les fourchettes cibles pour chaque groupe, comme les FC1 et les PGP, \u00e9taient affich\u00e9es sur le site Web d\u2019IRCC chaque ann\u00e9e. M. Bornais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure d\u2019expliquer pourquoi le rapport au Parlement a chang\u00e9, n\u2019incluant plus les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs pour les diff\u00e9rentes sous-cat\u00e9gories.\n[175] Au cours de ce contre-interrogatoire, le plaignant a qualifi\u00e9 la ventilation des fourchettes d\u2019objectifs pour les diff\u00e9rentes sous-cat\u00e9gories d\u2019assortiment. Il a interrog\u00e9 M. Bornais sur les derniers rapports au Parlement qui ne d\u00e9taillaient pas la combinaison, mais qui, au lieu de cela, \u00e9tablissaient des fourchettes d\u2019objectifs globaux pour tous les immigrants des cat\u00e9gories \u00e9conomique, familiale et de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, tous regroup\u00e9s ensemble. M. Attaran a demand\u00e9 si, du fait que seuls les objectifs globaux sont communiqu\u00e9s au Parlement, cela signifiait qu\u2019IRCC avait la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cider de la composition des diff\u00e9rentes sous-cat\u00e9gories dans le cadre des objectifs globaux. M. Bornais a r\u00e9pondu par la n\u00e9gative.\n[176] Lorsque M. Attaran a pos\u00e9 une question de suivi et a demand\u00e9 pourquoi il y avait eu une objection de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la question portait sur des sujets confidentiels du Cabinet. Le t\u00e9moin a \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu et il y a eu de longues discussions entre les avocats sur la question et sur le fait de savoir si elle concernait le Cabinet ou seulement IRCC. Lorsque le t\u00e9moin est revenu, j\u2019ai reformul\u00e9 la question. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Bornais pourquoi le minist\u00e8re ne consid\u00e9rait pas que le plan des niveaux, tel qu\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Parlement sans aucune indication sur le m\u00e9lange, signifiait qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de m\u00e9lange. Il y a eu une tr\u00e8s longue pause apr\u00e8s ma question et M. Bornais a simplement r\u00e9pondu que le minist\u00e8re avait entrepris de mettre en \u0153uvre le plan des niveaux approuv\u00e9 par le Cabinet. Une deuxi\u00e8me reformulation de la question a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 une autre longue pause et \u00e0 la m\u00eame r\u00e9ponse. (contre-interrogatoire de M. Bornais le 12 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e0 03:41:50.) La raison pour laquelle M. Bornais \u00e9vitait de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question n\u2019\u00e9tait pas claire, puisqu\u2019elle ne semblait pas impliquer un sujet confidentiel du Cabinet.\n[177] Apr\u00e8s l\u2019exclusion du t\u00e9moin, j\u2019ai fait remarquer que tous les rapports annuels examin\u00e9s comprenaient une ventilation r\u00e9troactive des fourchettes cibles pour chacune des sous-cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigration. Lorsqu\u2019il fait \u00e9tat des admissions effectives de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, chaque rapport annuel pr\u00e9sente une ventilation pour chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie, y compris les PGP et les FC1, et compare la fourchette d\u2019objectifs du plan de niveaux de l\u2019ann\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente pour chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie au nombre r\u00e9el d\u2019admissions dans chacune d\u2019entre elles.\n[178] M. Attaran a soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir comment nous sommes cens\u00e9s savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agit des fourchettes initiales du Cabinet ou des fourchettes cibles fix\u00e9es par IRCC pour s\u2019inscrire dans les chiffres globaux indiqu\u00e9s dans les rapports au Parlement.\n[179] D\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au Tribunal sugg\u00e8rent que, pour toutes les ann\u00e9es, le Cabinet a \u00e9tabli des fourchettes d\u2019objectifs sp\u00e9cifiques pour chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie, m\u00eame si elles ne figurent pas dans le rapport annuel au Parlement. Par exemple, la pi\u00e8ce 32 \u00e9tait un tableau comparatif pluriannuel qui examinait les objectifs pass\u00e9s et les fourchettes futures. (Ce document indiquait \u00e9galement que certaines cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans des cat\u00e9gories diff\u00e9rentes certaines ann\u00e9es, ce qui expliquerait l\u2019apparence de sous-d\u00e9claration. Toutefois, cela n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019incidence sur la d\u00e9claration des objectifs et des admissions du PGP).\n[180] Au cours d\u2019une autre exclusion du t\u00e9moin, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de la Commission que le Tribunal pourrait s\u2019appuyer sur le t\u00e9moignage oral de M. Bornais selon lequel la combinaison du plan des niveaux \u00e9tait affich\u00e9e sur le site Web d\u2019IRCC chaque ann\u00e9e, indiquant les fourchettes cibles pour chaque sous-cat\u00e9gorie. Mme Carrasco a \u00e9galement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que ces documents du site Web soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s comme preuves. Toutefois, le plaignant s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 leur introduction pour des raisons d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale, de sorte qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 admis comme \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[181] M. Attaran soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019IRCC \u2013 et non le Cabinet \u2013 est l\u2019auteur original des niveaux d\u2019admission dans le plan des niveaux, et que [Traduction] \u00ab le Cabinet ne fait que choisir dans le menu d\u2019options d\u2019IRCC \u00bb (paragraphe 126 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant).\n[182] Sur la base des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9cit\u00e9s, j\u2019estime que les plans de niveaux de ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es ont \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9s par le Cabinet et qu\u2019ils comprenaient une ventilation des fourchettes d\u2019objectifs pour les sous-cat\u00e9gories chaque ann\u00e9e, ce qui a guid\u00e9 le minist\u00e8re de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re que les ann\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9dentes, lorsque la composition \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans les rapports annuels.\n[183] En ce qui concerne le r\u00f4le d\u2019IRCC dans l\u2019\u00e9tablissement des niveaux propos\u00e9s, il n\u2019est ni choquant ni d\u00e9terminant que les propositions et les avis minist\u00e9riels sur le plan des niveaux parviennent d\u2019abord au Cabinet (m\u00e9moire de la plaignante, par. 135). IRCC peut avoir pr\u00e9par\u00e9 des options, des m\u00e9moires et m\u00eame des recommandations pour le ministre et le Cabinet. Toutefois, quel que soit le degr\u00e9 d\u2019assistance fourni par IRCC, je n\u2019accepte pas la position du plaignant selon laquelle les plans de niveaux sont autre chose qu\u2019un document du Cabinet. Le Cabinet est responsable de son contenu devant le Parlement et le public canadien.\n[184] L\u2019intim\u00e9 appelle le plan des niveaux la [Traduction] \u00ab source de la discrimination \u00bb, une expression utilis\u00e9e dans les affaires Forward et Matson. Dans le contexte de cette affaire, il soutient qu\u2019une plainte contre le temps d\u2019attente de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une plainte contre les allocations du plan des niveaux fix\u00e9es par le Cabinet (c.-\u00e0-d. le c\u00f4t\u00e9 de l\u2019offre). En d\u2019autres termes, l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de fourchettes cibles dans le plan des niveaux est l\u2019action qui a donn\u00e9 lieu au retard pr\u00e9tendument discriminatoire.\n[185] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait valoir que [Traduction] \u00ab lorsque le Cabinet approuve le plan des niveaux et que le ministre en fait rapport au Parlement en vertu de l\u2019article 94 de la LIPR, il ne fournit pas un service \u00bb. Les d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet sont analogues aux d\u00e9cisions du Parlement; elles se produisent aux plus hauts niveaux du gouvernement. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ajoute que le plan des niveaux ne r\u00e9pond pas aux principes de base permettant de le qualifier de service : les membres du public n\u2019effectuent pas une transaction [Traduction] \u00ab dans le cadre de la prestation d\u2019un service \u00bb lorsque le plan des niveaux est \u00e9tabli par le Cabinet. (M\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, paragraphes 196 \u00e0 200.)\n[186] Le principal argument de la Commission, abord\u00e9 plus loin, est que diverses pratiques discriminatoires ont eu lieu dans la mise en \u0153uvre du plan des niveaux par IRCC. Elle affirme qu\u2019en raison du large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019IRCC, le plan de classement mentionn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 94 de la LIPR est diff\u00e9rent des crit\u00e8res statutaires clairs dont disposaient les plaignants dans les affaires Forward, Murphy, Matson et Andrews. En cons\u00e9quence, ils soutiennent que le ratio de Matson\/Andrews n\u2019est pas le bon cadre \u00e0 suivre. Le point de d\u00e9part appropri\u00e9 est Watkin, comme d\u00e9crit pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Si la source de la discrimination devait avoir de l\u2019importance, ils notent que le plan des niveaux n\u2019est pas un texte l\u00e9gislatif parlementaire et n\u2019est donc pas immunis\u00e9 contre l\u2019examen de la LCDP. Cependant, la Commission affirme que la source n\u2019a pas d\u2019importance : [Traduction] \u00ab Il serait on\u00e9reux de sugg\u00e9rer que les parties et le Tribunal aillent derri\u00e8re le service vis\u00e9 par la plainte chaque fois qu\u2019un service gouvernemental est en cause \u00bb (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 47). En d\u2019autres termes, la Commission n\u2019a pas soutenu que les d\u00e9cisions sur les plans de niveaux prises par le Cabinet constituaient des pratiques discriminatoires; elle a plut\u00f4t soutenu que ces d\u00e9cisions n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pertinentes.\n[187] Bien que le plaignant n\u2019ait pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que les plans de niveaux constituaient une pratique discriminatoire, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que m\u00eame si le Cabinet fixe le plan des niveaux, il n\u2019est pas immunis\u00e9 contre l\u2019examen de la LCDP :\n[Traduction]\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 se trompe tout au long de son m\u00e9moire \u2013 avec ferveur et lassitude \u2013 en affirmant qu\u2019il y a quelque chose de sp\u00e9cial en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce dans le fait que le Cabinet a \u00e9tabli le plan des niveaux. Non seulement cela est contraire \u00e0 la jurisprudence (Vaziri), mais cela suppose une pr\u00e9rogative royale inexistante et non r\u00e9visable, et ne tient pas compte du fait que la loi du Parlement est supr\u00eame, y compris la LCDP. De l\u2019objection record de M. Stynes, \u00ab Cabinet confidence! \u00bb, lors du contre-interrogatoire de M. Bornais, \u00e0 son m\u00e9moire actuel, l\u2019intim\u00e9 lance le mot \u00ab Cabinet \u00bb comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019un sort magique permettant de jeter du sable dans les yeux du Tribunal et d\u2019\u00e9lever le gouvernement au-dessus de l\u2019examen des droits de la personne. C\u2019est un non-sens total, voire totalitaire. M\u00eame les d\u00e9cisions sur le Cabinet peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le juridique \u2013 point final, sans exception. [...] si une d\u00e9cision sur le fond du Cabinet peut faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire en vertu de la common law, comment pourrait-elle \u00eatre \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un contr\u00f4le du Tribunal en vertu de la loi quasi constitutionnelle qu\u2019est la LCDP? (M\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant, par. 8 et 9, gras dans l\u2019original)\n[188] Bien que les observations ci-dessus ressemblent \u00e0 une contestation de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du plan de niveaux par le Cabinet, j\u2019accepte les observations ant\u00e9rieures du plaignant selon lesquelles l\u2019\u00e9tablissement du plan de niveaux n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9 en tant que service en vertu de la LCDP.\na) Les plans de niveaux sont-ils contraignants?\n[189] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 son approche consistant \u00e0 mettre l\u2019accent sur le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre et d\u2019IRCC, M. Attaran fait valoir longuement que les plans de niveaux ne sont pas juridiquement contraignants et que les fonctionnaires ne sont pas tenus de les suivre (par. 43 du m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse). Ses conclusions finales citent \u00e9galement de nombreuses preuves que les plans de niveaux n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 suivis \u00e0 la lettre et qu\u2019il y a eu de nombreuses occasions o\u00f9 les fourchettes cibles fix\u00e9es dans les plans de niveaux n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9es. (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, paragraphes 51 \u00e0 57.) Il conclut que cela prouve que le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019admettre plus que le plan des niveaux a toujours exist\u00e9. Il conclut ainsi :\n[Traduction]\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, la fa\u00e7on dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9sente cette affaire \u2013 comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une contestation juridique du plan des niveaux du Cabinet, et comme si le plan des niveaux liait et bridait totalement IRCC, conduisant inexorablement \u00e0 des arri\u00e9r\u00e9s de PGP et \u00e0 de longs d\u00e9lais d\u2019attente \u2013 est un non-sens richement brod\u00e9. (paragraphe 135 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant)\n[190] La Commission admet que le plan des niveaux est l\u2019un des contr\u00f4les utilis\u00e9s pour g\u00e9rer les admissions et conc\u00e8de que le plan des niveaux comporte de nombreuses parties mobiles (m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse de la Commission, paragraphe 27). Elle soutient que la mise en \u0153uvre du plan de niveaux est un domaine o\u00f9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire est utilis\u00e9 et, par cons\u00e9quent, o\u00f9 le TCDP est comp\u00e9tent (paragraphe 6 du m\u00e9moire de la Commission). Elles soutiennent qu\u2019IRCC dispose d\u2019un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour manipuler les fourchettes cibles tout au long de l\u2019ann\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle peut effectivement r\u00e9\u00e9crire les programmes ou en cr\u00e9er de nouveaux (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 6). Selon la Commission, [Traduction] \u00ab IRCC peut, entre autres, emprunter, \u00e9changer, recalibrer, d\u00e9passer et manquer \u00bb (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 37).\n[191] Les preuves fournies par les t\u00e9moignages ont montr\u00e9 que la direction de la planification et de la performance des op\u00e9rations d\u2019IRCC, qui g\u00e8re la mise en \u0153uvre du plan des niveaux, utilise les fourchettes qui y sont d\u00e9finies comme des objectifs \u00e0 atteindre sur une base annuelle. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Tetford, son bureau rend compte chaque semaine des progr\u00e8s accomplis dans la r\u00e9alisation de ces objectifs annuels. Les bureaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger se sont \u00e9galement vu attribuer des objectifs \u00e0 atteindre (contre-interrogatoire de M. Tetford le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e0 03:28:45). La Commission ne conteste pas, sur la base de la preuve documentaire, qu\u2019IRCC respecte g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs fix\u00e9es (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 37). Toutefois, son argument met en \u00e9vidence les ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 IRCC n\u2019a pas atteint ou d\u00e9pass\u00e9 les fourchettes cibles, en particulier dans la cat\u00e9gorie PGP (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 39).\n[192] Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de l\u2019audience ont clairement montr\u00e9 que, toutes les ann\u00e9es, les objectifs d\u2019admission pour les PGP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s dans les plans de niveaux \u00e0 des niveaux bien inf\u00e9rieurs \u00e0 la demande r\u00e9elle (la demande \u00e9tant le nombre de personnes cherchant \u00e0 parrainer un parent ou un grand-parent). En revanche, les objectifs d\u2019admission pour les conjoints et les enfants mineurs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s \u00e0 un niveau suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9 dans l\u2019intention d\u2019absorber toutes les demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es afin d\u2019\u00e9viter l\u2019accumulation d\u2019un arri\u00e9r\u00e9. En ce qui concerne les demandes FC1, M. Bornais a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [Traduction] \u00ab les niveaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9s pour correspondre autant que possible \u00e0 la demande pr\u00e9vue, contrairement \u00e0 la plupart des programmes dans lesquels le minist\u00e8re essaie d\u2019\u00e9tablir la demande d\u2019admission en fonction de l\u2019offre dans l\u2019espace r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux niveaux \u00bb (examen direct du 10 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e0 48:45).\n[193] M. Tetford a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019entre juillet 2009 et le printemps 2012, la demande de parrainage de M. Attaran \u00e9tait essentiellement \u00ab dormante sur une tablette \u00bb dans la file d\u2019attente en attente d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9e. M. Tetford a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, chaque ann\u00e9e, il recevait l\u2019objectif fix\u00e9 dans le plan de niveaux et qu\u2019il affectait les ressources en cons\u00e9quence pour tenter d\u2019atteindre cet objectif. Les demandes comme celle de M. Attaran restaient dormante sur une tablette en tant que r\u00e9serve jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit temps de les traiter afin d\u2019atteindre l\u2019objectif fix\u00e9 dans le plan des niveaux. Les demandes \u00e9taient trait\u00e9es dans l\u2019ordre chronologique de leur r\u00e9ception, selon le principe du \u00ab premier entr\u00e9 - premier sorti \u00bb. M. Tetford a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les demandes des demandeurs visant \u00e0 \u00ab acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer \u00bb le traitement, comme celle formul\u00e9e par M. Kazem Attaran dans sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 8 mai 2012 (pi\u00e8ce 3, page 51), n\u2019auraient probablement que peu d\u2019impact. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que la plupart des personnes avaient une raison de vouloir que leur demande soit trait\u00e9e plus rapidement. S\u2019ils r\u00e9pondaient \u00e0 toutes les demandes, ce ne serait pas juste. C\u2019est pourquoi ils adh\u00e8rent au principe du premier arriv\u00e9 - premier sorti (contre-interrogatoire de M. Tetford par la Commission le 9 f\u00e9vrier 2021, \u00e0 partir de 03:31).\n[194] Si l\u2019on consid\u00e8re l\u2019ensemble des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, des explications raisonnables ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies pour expliquer les \u00e9carts par rapport aux fourchettes cibles du plan de niveaux. M. Cardinal a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019atteinte des fourchettes cibles n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une science exacte. Il a expliqu\u00e9 les nombreux d\u00e9fis rencontr\u00e9s lors de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution et de la mise en \u0153uvre du plan de niveaux. Les demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente sont trait\u00e9es et les visas d\u00e9livr\u00e9s dans de nombreux bureaux au Canada et dans le monde entier. Les d\u00e9fis op\u00e9rationnels comprennent des variables qui \u00e9chappent au contr\u00f4le d\u2019IRCC, \u00e0 savoir le gaspillage de visas (lorsqu\u2019une personne ne choisit pas d\u2019utiliser le visa qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9), le d\u00e9calage d\u2019\u00e9tablissement (\u00e9tablissement au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e civile suivant la d\u00e9livrance du visa), la saisonnalit\u00e9 et le fait de voyager avec des enfants \u00e0 charge qui peuvent devoir attendre la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e scolaire avant de voyager (m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, paragraphe 94).\n[195] L\u2019ampleur de ces \u00e9carts a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulign\u00e9e dans le rapport annuel 2008 du ministre au Parlement (pi\u00e8ce 21), \u00e0 la page 5. En 2007, l\u2019objectif global pour les nouveaux immigrants \u00e9tait de 240 000 \u00e0 265 000. Plus de 250 000 visas ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9s, mais il n\u2019y a eu que 236 758 admissions cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. En d\u2019autres termes, plus de 13 000 visas de r\u00e9sident permanent d\u00e9livr\u00e9s, repr\u00e9sentant plus de 5 % du total, n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9s au cours de cette ann\u00e9e civile.\n[196] L\u2019affectation de ressources appropri\u00e9es constitue \u00e9galement un d\u00e9fi. Les m\u00eames employ\u00e9s d\u2019IRCC qui traitent les demandes de PGP \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger doivent \u00e9galement faire face aux demandes saisonni\u00e8res de pointe pour le traitement des visas de visiteur et d\u2019\u00e9tudiant (contre-interrogatoire de M. Cardinal le 23 septembre 2021 \u00e0 01:03:50). M. Bornais a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 que des \u00e9carts se produisent en raison de ces multiples parties mobiles, mais qu\u2019IRCC fait n\u00e9anmoins tous les efforts possibles pour atteindre la fourchette cible dans le plan des niveaux. En d\u2019autres termes, il existe des r\u00e9alit\u00e9s pratiques qui font qu\u2019il est difficile d\u2019atteindre les fourchettes cibles (m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, par. 99; contre-interrogatoire de Glen Bornais le 12 f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 01:57:20). J\u2019accepte les t\u00e9moignages de M. Cardinal et de M. Bornais sur ces points comme \u00e9tant cr\u00e9dibles et convaincants.\n[197] En ce qui concerne l\u2019argument de la Commission selon lequel les plans de niveaux n\u2019\u00e9taient pas vraiment contraignants et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible de s\u2019en \u00e9carter, je suis guid\u00e9 par le t\u00e9moignage de M. Tetford qui a parl\u00e9 de la pi\u00e8ce 18, le document de politique r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Tracey Bender. \u00c0 la page 18, l\u2019auteure donne un aper\u00e7u du nombre de demandes arrivant au CTD-M \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pouvait pas refuser d\u2019accepter les demandes qui lui parvenaient, indiquant que la modification des niveaux aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre extr\u00eame pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande, dans une mesure qui n\u2019est pas compatible avec les objectifs concurrents en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration qu\u2019IRCC a pour t\u00e2che de mettre en \u0153uvre :\n[Traduction]\nLa gestion des niveaux n\u2019aurait jamais pu emp\u00eacher les r\u00e9serves de s\u2019accumuler tant au Canada qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. En 2002, plus de 22 000 parents et grands-parents ont obtenu le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent. Cette m\u00eame ann\u00e9e, la r\u00e9serve s\u2019\u00e9levait \u00e0 48 460 personnes, ce qui signifie que le d\u00e9lai de traitement \u00e9tait l\u00e9g\u00e8rement sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 deux ans. En 2003, cependant, le nombre de PGP accept\u00e9s en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents est rest\u00e9 relativement constant (19 394), mais la r\u00e9serve a augment\u00e9 de plus de 25 000 personnes, pour un nouveau total d\u2019environ 73 649 demandes de personnes en attente de traitement. Depuis 2004, la r\u00e9serve est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100 000 personnes.\nPour maintenir la r\u00e9serve au niveau de 2002, soit 48 460 personnes, il faudrait que plus de 44 000 personnes (soit 25 000 personnes suppl\u00e9mentaires) soient devenues des r\u00e9sidents permanents en 2003, plus de 69 000 personnes (soit 56 000 personnes suppl\u00e9mentaires) en 2004, plus de 71 000 (soit 59 000 personnes suppl\u00e9mentaires) en 2005 et plus de 79 000 personnes (soit plus de 59 000 personnes suppl\u00e9mentaires) en 2006, simplement pour maintenir la r\u00e9serve de 2002!\nCe qui ressort clairement de ce graphique (non illustr\u00e9), c\u2019est qu\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019accumulation de la r\u00e9serve en ajustant la r\u00e9partition 60\/40 et en augmentant simplement le nombre de parents et de grands-parents qui sont devenus des r\u00e9sidents permanents. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le niveau d\u2019admission des demandes (en nombre de personnes) chaque ann\u00e9e depuis 2002 \u00e9tait presque aussi \u00e9lev\u00e9 que le niveau de la r\u00e9serve de 2002 (48 460), il n\u2019aurait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019accumulation de la r\u00e9serve par la seule gestion des niveaux.\n[198] La r\u00e9partition 60\/40 faisait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019objectif global du gouvernement d\u2019admettre environ 60 % du total des immigrants dans les cat\u00e9gories \u00e9conomiques, les 40 % restants devant \u00eatre admis en tant que r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s et membres de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale (voir le paragraphe 86 de l\u2019affidavit de David Manicom, pi\u00e8ce 16).\n[199] M. Cardinal a fourni des preuves qui confirment l\u2019ampleur du probl\u00e8me. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019en 2011, m\u00eame si les fourchettes cibles pour les admissions de PGP \u00e9taient augment\u00e9es de 4 000 \u00e0 5 000 places par an, cela n\u2019aurait aucun effet sur le d\u00e9lai de traitement estim\u00e9 \u00e0 40 mois \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque (Examen de redirection de M. Cardinal le 24 septembre 2021 \u00e0 03:08:40).\n[200] Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer l\u2019intim\u00e9, l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 des PGP en 2011 \u00e9tait si important que les d\u00e9lais de traitement n\u2019auraient pu \u00eatre r\u00e9solus qu\u2019en apportant au plan des niveaux des changements si radicaux qu\u2019ils auraient perturb\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9quilibre des autres flux d\u2019immigration (tels que les classes \u00e9conomiques et les classes de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s), comme l\u2019avait d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le Cabinet. Il aurait fallu tripler ou quadrupler les niveaux d\u2019admission des PGP pour r\u00e9duire l\u2019inventaire en l\u2019espace de deux ou trois ans. (Voir le m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au paragraphe 276.)\n[201] Rien ne prouve qu\u2019IRCC avait le pouvoir de r\u00e9\u00e9crire, d\u2019\u00e9changer ou de cr\u00e9er unilat\u00e9ralement de nouveaux programmes. Bien que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve aient montr\u00e9 que les objectifs du plan des niveaux ont souvent \u00e9t\u00e9 manqu\u00e9s pour les raisons pr\u00e9cit\u00e9es, il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pass\u00e9s en raison d\u2019engagements minist\u00e9riels p\u00e9riodiques (contre-interrogatoire de Simon Cardinal le 23 septembre 2021 \u00e0 01:01:54). Par exemple, en 2015, le nombre de personnes prot\u00e9g\u00e9es et de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s a d\u00e9pass\u00e9 la fourchette cible de plus de 6 000 en raison de l\u2019engagement du nouveau gouvernement \u00e0 r\u00e9installer un grand nombre de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s syriens (voir la pi\u00e8ce 28 et le m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au paragraphe 105).\n[202] Rien ne permet de penser qu\u2019IRCC avait la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019augmenter le nombre de PGP de son propre chef, et certainement pas de mani\u00e8re aussi massive. La demande r\u00e9elle de places pour les PGP a toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9e, et permettre \u00e0 IRCC de d\u00e9passer suffisamment les objectifs pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 toute la demande aurait entra\u00een\u00e9 un nombre massif d\u2019admissions de PGP, ce qui aurait vid\u00e9 de leur sens les plans de niveaux.\n[203] J\u2019ai constat\u00e9 que le Cabinet \u00e9tablit le plan des niveaux. Aucune partie n\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que la LIPR ou son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application autorisait explicitement IRCC \u00e0 s\u2019\u00e9carter du plan des niveaux d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019intention et de l\u2019objet de ce plan. Le r\u00e9gime contient des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de discr\u00e9tion qui sont con\u00e7us pour aider le ministre \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser le plan des niveaux et \u00e0 mettre en \u0153uvre la LIPR, compte tenu de l\u2019\u00e9ventail des circonstances et des exigences qui peuvent survenir. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments discr\u00e9tionnaires ne signifient pas que le ministre ou IRCC doit ignorer les instructions du Cabinet.\n[204] En ce qui concerne l\u2019argument du plaignant selon lequel les d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet ne sont pas \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un examen au titre de la LCDP, ou que le Parlement est supr\u00eame et que les d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet peuvent faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, il ne s\u2019agit pas de la question en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. La question est de savoir si IRCC avait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, en vertu de la LIPR, de traiter les demandes d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui annulerait la diff\u00e9rence de traitement des PGP exprim\u00e9e dans les plans de niveaux.\n[205] Le fait que le Cabinet ait choisi de limiter les places d\u2019admission pour les PGP et de ne pas fixer d\u2019objectifs correspondant \u00e0 la demande r\u00e9elle (comme c\u2019est le cas pour les conjoints et les enfants) est une d\u00e9cision qui lui appartient.\n[206] IRCC doit mettre en \u0153uvre les d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet. La flexibilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e qui existait, ou le fait que les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs n\u2019\u00e9taient parfois pas atteintes, ne doit pas \u00eatre confondue avec un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire permettant \u00e0 IRCC d\u2019ignorer les objectifs du plan des niveaux et d\u2019admettre un nombre massif de PGP pour parvenir \u00e0 la parit\u00e9 avec les conjoints et les enfants.\nF. INSTRUCTIONS MINIST\u00c9RIELLES\na) L\u2019utilisation d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles par l\u2019IRCC impliquait-elle la fourniture d\u2019un service?\n[207] Outre la LIPR, son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application et les plans de niveau, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles guident les fonctionnaires d\u2019IRCC dans la r\u00e9ception et le traitement des demandes de parrainage de PGP. Le plaignant et la Commission all\u00e8guent que la non-utilisation et l\u2019utilisation, respectivement, des instructions minist\u00e9rielles par le ministre constituent des pratiques discriminatoires. En r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne sont pas un service.\n[208] La plaignante et la Commission affirment que le pouvoir d\u2019utiliser des instructions minist\u00e9rielles est un outil discr\u00e9tionnaire de prise de d\u00e9cision et devrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme un \u00e9l\u00e9ment de la prestation de service d\u2019IRCC dans le traitement des demandes. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 la d\u00e9finition du service dans l\u2019affaire Watkin. La cr\u00e9ation d\u2019une instruction minist\u00e9rielle par le ministre constitue-t-elle un service ou ne pr\u00e9sente-t-elle pas les caract\u00e9ristiques d\u2019un service?\n[209] Il convient d\u2019examiner le libell\u00e9 de l\u2019article 87.3 de la LIPR qui autorise le ministre \u00e0 cr\u00e9er des instructions minist\u00e9rielles :\nApplication\n87.3 (1) Le pr\u00e9sent article s\u2019applique aux demandes de visa et autres documents vis\u00e9es aux paragraphes 11(1) et (1.01) \u2014 sauf \u00e0 celle faite par la personne vis\u00e9e au paragraphe 99(2) \u2014, aux demandes de parrainage faites au titre du paragraphe 13(1), aux demandes de statut de r\u00e9sident permanent vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 21(1) ou de r\u00e9sident temporaire vis\u00e9es au paragraphe 22(1) faites par un \u00e9tranger se trouvant au Canada, aux demandes de permis de travail ou d\u2019\u00e9tudes ainsi qu\u2019aux demandes pr\u00e9vues au paragraphe 25(1) faites par un \u00e9tranger se trouvant hors du Canada.\nAtteinte des objectifs d\u2019immigration\n(2) Le traitement des demandes se fait de la mani\u00e8re qui, selon le ministre, est la plus susceptible d\u2019aider l\u2019atteinte des objectifs fix\u00e9s pour l\u2019immigration par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\nInstructions\n(3) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe (2), le ministre peut donner des instructions sur le traitement des demandes, notamment des instructions : a) pr\u00e9voyant les groupes de demandes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels s\u2019appliquent les instructions; a.1) pr\u00e9voyant des conditions, notamment par groupe, \u00e0 remplir en vue du traitement des demandes ou lors de celui-ci;\nb) pr\u00e9voyant l\u2019ordre de traitement des demandes, notamment par groupe; c) pr\u00e9cisant le nombre de demandes \u00e0 traiter par an, notamment par groupe;\nd) r\u00e9gissant la disposition des demandes dont celles faites de nouveau.\nApplication\n(3.1) Les instructions peuvent, lorsqu\u2019elles le pr\u00e9voient, s\u2019appliquer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des demandes pendantes faites avant la date o\u00f9 elles prennent effet.\nPr\u00e9cision (3.2) Il est entendu que les instructions donn\u00e9es en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a (3)c) peuvent pr\u00e9ciser que le nombre de demandes \u00e0 traiter par an, notamment par groupe, est de z\u00e9ro.Respect des instructions\n(4) L\u2019agent \u2014 ou la personne habilit\u00e9e \u00e0 exercer les pouvoirs du ministre pr\u00e9vus \u00e0 l\u2019article 25 \u2014 est tenu de se conformer aux instructions avant et pendant le traitement de la demande; s\u2019il ne proc\u00e8de pas au traitement de la demande, il peut, conform\u00e9ment aux instructions du ministre, la retenir, la retourner ou en disposer.Pr\u00e9cision (5) Le fait de retenir ou de retourner une demande ou d\u2019en disposer ne constitue pas un refus de d\u00e9livrer les visa ou autres documents, d\u2019octroyer le statut ou de lever tout ou partie des crit\u00e8res et obligations applicables.Publication\n(6) Les instructions sont publi\u00e9es dans la Gazette du Canada.\nPr\u00e9cision (7) Le pr\u00e9sent article n\u2019a pas pour effet de porter atteinte au pouvoir du ministre de d\u00e9terminer de toute autre fa\u00e7on la mani\u00e8re la plus efficace d\u2019assurer l\u2019application de la loi.\n[210] L\u2019introduction des instructions minist\u00e9rielles a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e par l\u2019expert juridique Mario Bellissimo dans un document auquel la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son m\u00e9moire, au paragraphe 40 :\n[Traduction]\nEn 2008, le programme f\u00e9d\u00e9ral canadien des travailleurs qualifi\u00e9s (TQF) \u00e9tait confront\u00e9 \u00e0 un \u00e9norme arri\u00e9r\u00e9. Le nombre de demandeurs d\u00e9passait largement la capacit\u00e9 du programme et, en 2008, plus de 600 000 demandeurs \u00e9taient en attente de traitement alors que ce nombre continuait d\u2019augmenter.

Cette disposition conf\u00e8re au ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration (actuellement le ministre Jason Kenney) de larges pouvoirs pour fixer des quotas de traitement et des priorit\u00e9s pour diff\u00e9rentes cat\u00e9gories de demandes au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e donn\u00e9e par le biais d\u2019\u00ab instructions minist\u00e9rielles \u00bb, et pour \u00e9liminer sommairement les demandes qui ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 ces crit\u00e8res. (Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, c. 27, article 87.3(3) [en vigueur du 18 juin 2008 au 28 juin 2012], article 3). Cette disposition pr\u00e9voit \u00e9galement que toute mesure prise en application de ces instructions minist\u00e9rielles \u00ab ne constitue pas une d\u00e9cision de ne pas d\u00e9livrer le visa ou autre document, ou d\u2019accorder le statut ou la dispense \u00bb (Loi sur l\u2019immigration et la protection des r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s, L.C. 2001, c. 27, paragraphe 87.3(5)), tentant ainsi de mettre ces d\u00e9cisions \u00e0 l\u2019abri d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada. (soulignement ajout\u00e9)\n[211] Selon M. Bellissimo, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles sont le nouvel outil utilis\u00e9 pour effectuer des actions qui ne seraient pas attaqu\u00e9es dans le cadre d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire, comme une d\u00e9cision sur le refus d\u2019un visa ou d\u2019un document ou l\u2019octroi d\u2019un statut ou d\u2019une exemption.\n[212] En outre, le paragraphe 5(2) de la LIPR exige que le ministre d\u00e9pose devant chaque chambre du Parlement, pour renvoi \u00e0 la commission comp\u00e9tente de chaque chambre, tout projet de r\u00e8glement affectant les sections les plus importantes pour l\u2019admission au Canada. Le recours aux instructions minist\u00e9rielles par le ministre, pour imposer des conditions et des limites importantes aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019immigration, permet d\u2019\u00e9viter l\u2019examen par les commissions des Chambres du Parlement qui \u00e9tait auparavant n\u00e9cessaire lorsque des modifications \u00e9taient apport\u00e9es par voie r\u00e9glementaire.\n[213] La toute premi\u00e8re instruction minist\u00e9rielle, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en preuve comme pi\u00e8ce 93, se concentre sur l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 des demandes de travailleurs qualifi\u00e9s (f\u00e9d\u00e9ral). Elle introduit de nouveaux crit\u00e8res pour les demandes de TQF re\u00e7ues apr\u00e8s le 29 f\u00e9vrier 2008, qui seraient [Traduction] \u00ab mises en traitement d\u00e8s leur r\u00e9ception \u00bb. Les demandes de TQF re\u00e7ues avant cette date ont donc \u00e9t\u00e9 class\u00e9es sans priorit\u00e9. Cette mesure a marqu\u00e9 l\u2019abandon de la r\u00e8gle du \u00ab premier entr\u00e9 - premier sorti \u00bb, qui consistait \u00e0 trancher sur une requ\u00eate selon l\u2019ordre de r\u00e9ception. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un changement important qui a affect\u00e9 des centaines de milliers de personnes dans la file d\u2019attente des TQF qui ont perdu leur priorit\u00e9 dans cette file d\u2019attente. Ces personnes, qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur demande avant le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2008, ont vu leur demande languir jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce qu\u2019elle soit \u00ab rejet\u00e9e \u00bb par les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la LIPR en 2012. La nouvelle modification, le paragraphe 87(4) de la LIPR, incluait le paragraphe (3) consid\u00e9rant que la r\u00e9siliation ne constituait pas une d\u00e9cision sur la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un visa de r\u00e9sident permanent (isolation du contr\u00f4le judiciaire selon M. Bellissimo) et le paragraphe (5) excluant tout droit de recours ou d\u2019indemnisation contre le gouvernement pour la r\u00e9siliation de leurs demandes, qui \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 languissaient depuis au moins quatre ans, mais dans la majorit\u00e9 des cas, depuis bien plus longtemps.\n[214] Les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ult\u00e9rieures pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme preuves ont r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es \u00e0 diverses fins pour affiner les crit\u00e8res de s\u00e9lection et imposer des limites au nombre de demandes re\u00e7ues dans diverses cat\u00e9gories, y compris les PGP. Elles pr\u00e9voyaient \u00e9galement des dispositions pour les demandes de certaines cat\u00e9gories qui ne seraient tout simplement \u00ab pas trait\u00e9es \u00bb (voir l\u2019exemple de la pi\u00e8ce 93).\n[215] Huit instructions minist\u00e9rielles ayant une incidence sur les demandes de parrainage de PGP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en preuve. Seule l\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 4 a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9mise pendant la p\u00e9riode couverte par la demande de M. Attaran. Publi\u00e9e fin 2011, elle a impos\u00e9 un moratoire temporaire sur la r\u00e9ception de nouvelles demandes de parrainage, mais cela n\u2019a pas affect\u00e9 le plaignant. Les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ult\u00e9rieures, publi\u00e9es de 2014 \u00e0 2020, ont impos\u00e9 des plafonds d\u2019admission pour les parrainages et diff\u00e9rentes m\u00e9thodes de s\u00e9lection pour ces demandes. Certaines ann\u00e9es, le d\u00e9lai de soumission des demandes \u00e9tait court. D\u2019autres ann\u00e9es, la s\u00e9lection se faisait de mani\u00e8re al\u00e9atoire. Ces instructions minist\u00e9rielles ult\u00e9rieures n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019incidence sur le plaignant ou d\u2019autres personnes comme lui qui cherchaient \u00e0 parrainer des parents ou des grands-parents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[216] La Commission d\u00e9crit les instructions minist\u00e9rielles comme une forme innovante d\u2019\u00e9laboration de la loi qui laisse une grande marge de man\u0153uvre pour r\u00e9organiser la politique et les crit\u00e8res (M\u00e9moire de la CCDP, paragraphes 40 et 45).\n[217] La position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 est que les mesures politiques n\u00e9cessaires pour permettre le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission ne peuvent \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9es de \u00ab service \u00bb parce qu\u2019elles n\u2019ont pas la connotation transitive requise pour un service, comme l\u2019a d\u00e9crit la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Gould. En outre, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne ressemblent pas \u00e0 des \u00ab biens... des installations ou de moyens d\u2019h\u00e9bergements \u00bb. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019interface publique avec le fournisseur de services pr\u00e9sum\u00e9. Il n\u2019y a pas de capacit\u00e9 ni d\u2019obligation d\u2019\u00ab accommoder \u00bb les circonstances individuelles (m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, paragraphes 208 et 194.)\n[218] Il est clair que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne sont pas des d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet. Les instructions minist\u00e9rielles se distinguent des d\u00e9cisions du Cabinet, car elles r\u00e9sultent de l\u2019opinion du ministre. Le paragraphe 87.3(2) de la LIPR indique clairement qu\u2019en accordant au ministre le pouvoir de donner des instructions minist\u00e9rielles, ce pouvoir doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re particuli\u00e8re : \u00ab Le traitement des demandes se fait de la mani\u00e8re qui, selon le ministre, est la plus susceptible d\u2019aider l\u2019atteinte des objectifs fix\u00e9s pour l\u2019immigration par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb. Cet article n\u2019autorise pas le ministre \u00e0 fixer des objectifs d\u2019immigration contraires \u00e0 ceux fix\u00e9s par le Parlement et le Cabinet.\n[219] La pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance de la preuve dans cette affaire est que le ministre, en donnant des instructions minist\u00e9rielles, tentait de mettre en \u0153uvre \u00ab des objectifs fix\u00e9s pour l\u2019immigration par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral \u00bb, comme l\u2019exige le paragraphe 87.3(2) de la LIPR. La combinaison d\u2019une forte demande de parrainage de PGP et de fourchettes cibles relativement basses dans les plans de niveaux signifiait qu\u2019IRCC avait, d\u2019une part, de grandes difficult\u00e9s avec les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s et, d\u2019autre part, l\u2019insatisfaction des demandeurs potentiels qui \u00e9taient exclus par les contr\u00f4les d\u2019admission.\n[220] Lorsque les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ont finalement \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre en 2011 pour traiter les PGP, le ministre a trait\u00e9 les demandeurs de PGP diff\u00e9remment des autres cat\u00e9gories, mais cela \u00e9tait in\u00e9vitable pour mettre en \u0153uvre les objectifs des plans de niveaux, de la LIPR et du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. \u00c0 l\u2019exception de l\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 4, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ult\u00e9rieures sont tr\u00e8s \u00e9loign\u00e9es du cadre temporel de la plainte de M. Attaran et n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019incidence sur lui ou sur d\u2019autres personnes comme lui qui pr\u00e9sentaient des demandes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n[221] \u00c0 mon avis, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne constituent pas un service au sens de la LCDP. Elles n\u2019ont pas la connotation transitive requise. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019interface entre le public et le ministre (Gould, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 55). Toutes les actions du gouvernement ne sont pas des services (Watkin, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, paragraphe 33).\n[222] Apr\u00e8s cette conclusion, j\u2019aborde maintenant les arguments sp\u00e9cifiques du plaignant et de la Commission.\nb) Non-d\u00e9ploiement des instructions minist\u00e9rielles de 2008 \u00e0 2011 pour contr\u00f4ler l\u2019arriv\u00e9e des demandes afin de pr\u00e9venir l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9\n[223] M. Attaran all\u00e8gue que le non-d\u00e9ploiement des instructions minist\u00e9rielles de 2008 \u00e0 2011 pour contr\u00f4ler la r\u00e9ception des demandes de PGP constitue un traitement d\u00e9favorable, car, selon lui, cela aurait permis de r\u00e9duire la croissance de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 de demandes au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[224] Au moment o\u00f9 M. Attaran a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de parrainage, le CTD\u2011Mississauga ne pouvait puiser dans le r\u00e9pertoire, selon le principe du premier entr\u00e9 - premier sorti, qu\u2019un nombre limit\u00e9 de demandes suffisantes pour combler les places pr\u00e9vues dans le plan des niveaux pour le sous-groupe des PGP cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0. Cependant, en m\u00eame temps, il n\u2019y a pas eu de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission. Le nombre de nouvelles candidatures arrivant chaque ann\u00e9e d\u00e9passait de loin le nombre de places allou\u00e9es dans le plan de niveaux. L\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 de dossiers a donc augment\u00e9.\n[225] IRCC n\u2019a pas mis en \u0153uvre de contr\u00f4les de r\u00e9ception des demandes avant que la modification de la LIPR en 2008 ne conf\u00e8re au ministre le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9mettre des instructions minist\u00e9rielles. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Cardinal, le ministre a d\u2019abord utilis\u00e9 les instructions minist\u00e9rielles pour contr\u00f4ler l\u2019admission et \u00e9liminer l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 dans la cat\u00e9gorie des travailleurs qualifi\u00e9s (f\u00e9d\u00e9ral) en 2008.\n[226] Le ministre n\u2019a pas invoqu\u00e9 ce pouvoir en ce qui concerne les demandes de PGP avant 2011, lorsque l\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 4 a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en \u0153uvre pour interrompre l\u2019acceptation des nouvelles demandes de parrainage de PGP de novembre 2011 \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e 2013. Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, au cours des ann\u00e9es suivantes, un certain nombre d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9es pour contr\u00f4ler la r\u00e9ception des nouvelles demandes de parrainage de PGP, y compris par le biais d\u2019une loterie.\n[227] M. Attaran soutient que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu plus t\u00f4t : (i) suspendre l\u2019admission de nouvelles demandes; (ii) imposer une limite ou un \u00ab plafond \u00bb au nombre de demandes qu\u2019il accepte d\u2019admettre; (iii) \u00e9mettre un nombre limit\u00e9 d\u2019invitations \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter une demande; et\/ou (iv) proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une s\u00e9lection al\u00e9atoire ou \u00e0 une loterie pour s\u00e9lectionner un groupe de demandes. M. Attaran a cit\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce 65 pour montrer que ces options avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 envisag\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[228] M. Attaran reconna\u00eet que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fini par mettre en \u0153uvre une pause et les autres m\u00e9thodes sugg\u00e9r\u00e9es pour contr\u00f4ler le nombre de demandes. Toutefois, ces mesures n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises qu\u2019apr\u00e8s qu\u2019il eut pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de parrainage de ses parents et que celle-ci eut rejoint la file d\u2019attente existante au CTD-Mississauga.\n[229] M. Attaran all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait d\u00fb utiliser ces mesures de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission plus t\u00f4t afin de r\u00e9duire le temps total de traitement de sa demande, et qu\u2019en ne le faisant pas, lui et sa famille ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 un traitement d\u00e9favorable par rapport aux conjoints et partenaires (pour lesquels la demande et l\u2019offre \u00e9taient raisonnablement ad\u00e9quates) et \u00e0 d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants qui ont fait l\u2019objet de contr\u00f4les de l\u2019admission plus t\u00f4t (par exemple, les travailleurs qualifi\u00e9s \u00e9trangers en 2008) (par. 122 et 143 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant).\n[230] M. Attaran n\u2019a pas sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 quelle instruction minist\u00e9rielle en particulier aurait pu \u00eatre mise en \u0153uvre en 2008, ce qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9fique et n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en soi discriminatoire. Il est vrai que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles relatives aux PGP auraient pu \u00eatre mises en \u0153uvre plus t\u00f4t, d\u00e8s 2008. Toutefois, s\u2019il y avait eu un contr\u00f4le plus pr\u00e9coce de l\u2019admission \u00e0 son profit, il semblerait que cela se soit fait au d\u00e9triment de l\u2019exclusion d\u2019autres candidats potentiels.\n[231] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne que si les instructions minist\u00e9rielles avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises en \u0153uvre en 2008 pour le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission des demandeurs de PGP, M. Attaran aurait pu \u00eatre confront\u00e9 \u00e0 des mesures telles qu\u2019un moratoire et ne pas \u00eatre en mesure de soumettre une demande de parrainage. (M. Attaran qualifie cet argument de fabrication factuelle et sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019intim\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab sp\u00e9cule de mani\u00e8re exag\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00bb en l\u2019avan\u00e7ant sans citer aucune preuve. (voir le paragraphe 80 du m\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse du plaignant).\n[232] Les preuves ont montr\u00e9 que la premi\u00e8re instruction minist\u00e9rielle concernant l\u2019admission des PGP, l\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 4 du 5 novembre 2011, a mis en place un moratoire sur l\u2019admission des nouvelles demandes de parrainage de PGP qui a dur\u00e9 26 mois. Si des contr\u00f4les d\u2019admission avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place plus t\u00f4t, ils auraient emp\u00each\u00e9 certaines des personnes cherchant \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une demande entre 2008 et 2011 de le faire. C\u2019est le sens et l\u2019objectif du \u00ab contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission \u00bb, et c\u2019est ce qui s\u2019est produit apr\u00e8s 2011. L\u2019argument de M. Attaran suppose que sa demande aurait n\u00e9anmoins \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019une de celles qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 accept\u00e9es et ajout\u00e9es dans la r\u00e9serve.\n[233] L\u2019argument en faveur d\u2019un contr\u00f4le plus pr\u00e9coce de l\u2019admission au moyen d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne tient pas non plus compte de l\u2019\u00ab \u00e9l\u00e9phant dans la pi\u00e8ce \u00bb. Toute forme de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission, compar\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019admission \u00e0 la demande des membres de la cat\u00e9gorie de la famille FC1, repr\u00e9sente un traitement d\u00e9favorable des PGP.\nc) Des instructions minist\u00e9rielles agressives (par exemple, des plafonds, des moratoires et des loteries) sont utilis\u00e9es pour les PGP, mais non pour les conjoints et les enfants.\n[234] La Commission a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 une deuxi\u00e8me forme d\u2019utilisation inappropri\u00e9e des instructions minist\u00e9rielles. Alors que M. Attaran a fait valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 aurait pu mettre en \u0153uvre les instructions minist\u00e9rielles plus t\u00f4t pour limiter le nombre de demandes de parrainage de PGP, la Commission a soutenu que l\u2019utilisation agressive des instructions minist\u00e9rielles par le ministre pour contr\u00f4ler le nombre de demandes de PGP constituait un traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[235] Depuis novembre 2011, plusieurs instructions minist\u00e9rielles pr\u00e9voient des plafonds, des moratoires et m\u00eame des loteries pour les demandeurs de PGP, mais pas pour les conjoints et les enfants. Par exemple, l\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 4 a introduit le moratoire de 26 mois sur l\u2019admission en 2011. L\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 9 a fix\u00e9 \u00e0 5 000 le nombre maximal de demandes de parrainage de PGP en 2014. L\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 21 a fix\u00e9 un plafond d\u2019admission pour 2017 \u00e0 10 000. L\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 25 a introduit un syst\u00e8me de s\u00e9lection al\u00e9atoire et fix\u00e9 le plafond pour 2018 \u00e0 10 000. L\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle n\u00b0 43 a introduit une courte p\u00e9riode en 2020 pendant laquelle les parrains potentiels peuvent soumettre un int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e0 parrainer, qui, s\u2019il est s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9, conduira \u00e0 une invitation \u00e0 soumettre une demande. Elle a \u00e9galement fix\u00e9 le plafond d\u2019admission pour 2021 \u00e0 10 000.\n[236] La Commission observe que plusieurs m\u00e9morandums adress\u00e9s au ministre d\u2019IRCC et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s lors de l\u2019audience sugg\u00e8rent l\u2019utilisation de certains outils pour recalibrer le nombre de demandes en attente par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019offre de places d\u2019admission dans les plans de niveau pour les demandes de PGP. Les m\u00e9morandums font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des outils tels que les pauses temporaires, l\u2019admission par ordre d\u2019arriv\u00e9e avec une ouverture limit\u00e9e dans le temps, les s\u00e9lections al\u00e9atoires, les moratoires et les plafonds. Cependant, la Commission note que le dossier ne montre nulle part que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a utilis\u00e9 de tels \u00ab outils agressifs \u00bb pour calibrer les num\u00e9ros de demande pour les conjoints et les enfants mineurs (m\u00e9moire de la Commission, paragraphe 91). Elle renvoie au t\u00e9moignage de M. Cardinal qui a confirm\u00e9 que les FC1 n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 ces outils pour le contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission des demandes parce que les niveaux de demande d\u2019admission ont \u00e9t\u00e9 constamment align\u00e9s sur le plan des niveaux (par. 91 du m\u00e9moire de la Commission). Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, le Cabinet a fix\u00e9 les fourchettes cibles du plan des niveaux pour les admissions de r\u00e9sidents permanents dans le sous-groupe FC1 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui s\u2019aligne syst\u00e9matiquement sur le nombre de personnes cherchant effectivement \u00e0 \u00eatre parrain\u00e9es. Ainsi, les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas un probl\u00e8me pour les FC1.\n[237] La Commission sugg\u00e8re que l\u2019utilisation des instructions minist\u00e9rielles pour g\u00e9rer la r\u00e9ception des demandes est une [Traduction] \u00ab solution capricieuse \u00bb pour les arri\u00e9r\u00e9s des parents et des grands-parents qui sugg\u00e8rent un traitement d\u00e9favorable. La Commission soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas de preuves qui soutiennent une explication raisonnable pour le traitement d\u00e9favorable des PGP caus\u00e9 par l\u2019utilisation des instructions minist\u00e9rielles, mais non pour les FC1. Elle affirme que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles marginalisent davantage la cat\u00e9gorie des PGP.\n[238] Faisant \u00e9cho \u00e0 ces arguments de la Commission, M. Attaran observe qu\u2019aucun autre membre de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale que les PGP [Traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a subi l\u2019indignit\u00e9 d\u2019une loterie \u00bb (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, paragraphe 160).\n[239] Pour la Commission, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 au ministre en vertu de l\u2019article 87.3 de la LIPR se distingue encore une fois de l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews, o\u00f9 le service de traitement n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter diff\u00e9remment les crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. En utilisant les instructions minist\u00e9rielles, le ministre dispose d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire dans la mise en \u0153uvre des politiques et des pratiques relatives \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution du programme d\u2019immigration (paragraphe 20 du m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse de la Commission).\n[240] Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait valoir que l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles s\u2019apparente aux faits de l\u2019affaire Beattie c. Affaires indiennes et du Nord Canada, 2014 TCDP 1 (Beattie). Dans l\u2019affaire Beattie, l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui traitait une demande de statut d\u2019Indien, disposait d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation qui n\u2019\u00e9tablissait pas de distinction en fonction d\u2019un motif illicite.\n[241] Dans l\u2019affaire Beattie, l\u2019option non discriminatoire relevant du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du fonctionnaire avait \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9e. L\u2019interpr\u00e9tation de la Loi sur les Indiens par le fonctionnaire a contribu\u00e9 au traitement d\u00e9favorable subi par le plaignant, alors que dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews, le fonctionnaire n\u2019avait pas le choix, car la source du traitement d\u00e9favorable \u00e9tait enti\u00e8rement imputable aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 de la Loi sur les Indiens.\n[242] Dans l\u2019affaire Beattie, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019un repr\u00e9sentant du gouvernement n\u2019avait pas exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 la LCDP. Dans cette plainte, l\u2019all\u00e9gation est que le ministre n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, dans l\u2019exercice de son opinion sur la meilleure fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9aliser les objectifs du Cabinet au moyen d\u2019instructions minist\u00e9rielles, d\u2019une mani\u00e8re conforme \u00e0 la LCDP.\nd) Non-utilisation et utilisation des instructions minist\u00e9rielles par le ministre apr\u00e8s 2008 : analyse du traitement d\u00e9favorable all\u00e9gu\u00e9e\n[243] En commen\u00e7ant par la position de l\u2019intim\u00e9 sur l\u2019utilisation inappropri\u00e9e pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des instructions minist\u00e9rielles et l\u2019absence de mise en \u0153uvre de contr\u00f4les de l\u2019admission avant 2008, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir qu\u2019avant la modification de 2008 \u00e0 la LIPR autorisant les instructions minist\u00e9rielles, le ministre n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019arr\u00eater ou de limiter l\u2019admission de nouvelles demandes sans l\u2019intervention du Parlement ou du Cabinet.\n[244] Le plaignant r\u00e9torque que l\u2019argument de l\u2019intim\u00e9 [Traduction] \u00ab est un mensonge \u00e9hont\u00e9 \u00bb et que la version originale de la LIPR adopt\u00e9e en 2001 au paragraphe 14(2) permettait aux r\u00e8glements de r\u00e9gir le nombre de demandes au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e (m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse du plaignant, paragraphes 51-52). Il soutient que les modifications r\u00e9glementaires auraient pu mettre en \u0153uvre des mesures de contr\u00f4le de l\u2019admission telles que des loteries, des moratoires et des plafonds. L\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9cise dans sa contre-r\u00e9plique (au paragraphe 12) que les modifications apport\u00e9es \u00e0 la LIPR en 2008 ont donn\u00e9 au ministre le pouvoir, pour la premi\u00e8re fois, de contr\u00f4ler le nombre de demandes.\n[245] Les parties ne soutiennent pas le m\u00eame point ici. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ont montr\u00e9 que le gouvernement a effectivement eu recours \u00e0 la r\u00e9glementation pour r\u00e9duire le nombre de demandes de PGP en 2014 en appliquant la division 133(1)j)(i)(B) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR afin d\u2019augmenter de 30 % le revenu minimum requis pour le parrain. M. Attaran a raison de dire que le paragraphe 14(2) de la LIPR pr\u00e9voit que le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR peut contenir des dispositions relatives au nombre de demandes pouvant \u00eatre trait\u00e9es ou approuv\u00e9es au cours d\u2019une ann\u00e9e. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019en l\u2019absence de dispositions dans la LIPR ou dans un r\u00e8glement, IRCC n\u2019avait pas le pouvoir de refuser d\u2019accepter des demandes de parrainage au point d\u2019accueil jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles entrent en jeu en 2008. Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements n\u2019est pas le service dont le Tribunal est saisi dans le cadre de cette plainte. L\u2019accent doit rester mis sur les pouvoirs dont disposait le ministre en vertu de l\u2019article 87.3 de la LIPR et sur la question de savoir si ces pouvoirs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 exerc\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e.\n[246] Les instructions minist\u00e9rielles impliquent la mise en \u0153uvre de processus permettant d\u2019atteindre au mieux les objectifs du Canada en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration, qui sont exprim\u00e9s dans la LIPR, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR et les plans de niveaux \u00e9tablis par le Cabinet. Le libell\u00e9 de la loi (article 87.3) indique clairement que le ministre dispose d\u2019un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour d\u00e9terminer la mani\u00e8re la plus efficace d\u2019administrer la LIPR (paragraphe (7)). Le paragraphe (2) pr\u00e9cise que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles refl\u00e8tent l\u2019opinion du ministre sur la fa\u00e7on de soutenir les objectifs du gouvernement en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration, qui comprennent les objectifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la LIPR, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR et les d\u00e9cisions sur les fourchettes cibles pour les cat\u00e9gories de demandeurs, telles qu\u2019elles sont exprim\u00e9es dans les plans d\u2019immigration.\n[247] Toutefois, l\u2019existence d\u2019un pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire n\u2019implique pas n\u00e9cessairement l\u2019existence d\u2019un service. Pour les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es, j\u2019ai conclu que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne constituent pas un service. M. Attaran n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019argument convaincant pour d\u00e9montrer comment une utilisation plus pr\u00e9coce des contr\u00f4les d\u2019admission au moyen des instructions minist\u00e9rielles aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 b\u00e9n\u00e9fique pour lui ou pour d\u2019autres personnes comme lui cherchant \u00e0 parrainer des parents et des grands-parents.\n[248] Les instructions minist\u00e9rielles post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 2011 que la Commission cherche \u00e0 contester ne peuvent pas \u00eatre incluses dans cette plainte. Les contr\u00f4les ult\u00e9rieurs n\u2019ont eu aucune incidence sur la demande de M. Attaran ou des autres personnes qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur demande en m\u00eame temps que lui. Bien que leur pr\u00e9sentation en tant que preuve ait donn\u00e9 un contexte et un aper\u00e7u de l\u2019utilisation des instructions minist\u00e9rielles, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 2011 ont eu un effet sur les personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 un nouveau r\u00e9gime de traitement des demandes de PGP. Ce nouveau r\u00e9gime comprenait des contr\u00f4les stricts de la r\u00e9ception des demandes, ce qui a permis d\u2019\u00e9liminer l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 des demandes de PGP et de traiter beaucoup plus rapidement les dossiers accept\u00e9s.\n[249] En conclusion, les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne sont pas des services. En outre, le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas convaincu le Tribunal, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que leur utilisation ant\u00e9rieure aurait am\u00e9lior\u00e9 le temps d\u2019attente subi par M. Attaran et sa famille. Par cons\u00e9quent, ces all\u00e9gations sont rejet\u00e9es.\nXIV. Le fait que le ministre n\u2019ait pas fait usage du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re du paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR d\u2019exempter les demandeurs de PGP de certaines exigences financi\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans le r\u00e8glement constitue-t-il un traitement d\u00e9favorable dans la prestation d\u2019un service?\n[250] Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait valoir que les parrains de PGP sont soumis \u00e0 des exigences financi\u00e8res plus on\u00e9reuses que les parrains d\u2019autres membres de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale. M. Attaran soutient que les seuils financiers plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s pour le parrainage de PGP constituent un traitement d\u00e9favorable pour ceux qui souhaitent parrainer des parents et des grands-parents parce qu\u2019ils rendent plus difficile l\u2019\u00e9ligibilit\u00e9 au parrainage. Il all\u00e8gue ensuite que le ministre aurait d\u00fb utiliser le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR, dont il est question ci-dessous, pour \u00e9liminer cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement. Le fait que le ministre n\u2019ait pas utilis\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de cette mani\u00e8re constitue, selon M. Attaran, une pratique discriminatoire.\n[251] Premi\u00e8rement, le Tribunal a entendu la preuve que chaque r\u00e9pondant de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial doit pr\u00e9senter un engagement d\u2019aide dans le cadre de sa demande de parrainage. Selon le paragraphe 132(1) de la LIPR, \u00ab le r\u00e9pondant s\u2019engage \u00e0 rembourser \u00e0 Sa Majest\u00e9 du chef du Canada ou de la province en cause les prestations fournies \u00e0 titre d\u2019assistance sociale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger parrain\u00e9, ou pour son compte, ou aux membres de la famille de celui-ci \u00bb.\n[252] La dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement d\u2019assistance du r\u00e9pondant est d\u00e9finie aux alin\u00e9as 132(1)a) et b) du r\u00e8glement de la LIPR et varie en fonction du type de demandeur. La date de d\u00e9but de l\u2019engagement est d\u00e9finie \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 132(1)a) comme la date \u00e0 laquelle le parent parrain\u00e9 arrive au Canada avec un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire, obtient un permis de s\u00e9jour temporaire pendant son s\u00e9jour au Canada ou devient r\u00e9sident permanent. Les dates limites varient consid\u00e9rablement en fonction de la sous-cat\u00e9gorie d\u2019immigrant. Alors que les r\u00e9pondants FC1 sont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement tenus de respecter leur engagement pendant trois ans (alin\u00e9a 132(1)b)(i) de la LIPR), les r\u00e9pondants PGP sont tenus de respecter leur engagement pendant beaucoup plus longtemps. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Attaran a parrain\u00e9 ses parents, l\u2019engagement d\u2019assistance qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 l\u2019engageait pour dix ans apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de ses parents. Toutefois, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR a depuis \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 pour exiger que les r\u00e9pondants des PGP signent des engagements valables pendant 20 ans apr\u00e8s l\u2019arriv\u00e9e de leurs parents au Canada : sous-alin\u00e9a 132(1)b)(iv) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. La dur\u00e9e de l\u2019engagement pour les parrains FC1 n\u2019a pas chang\u00e9.\n[253] Les parrains des parents et des grands-parents sont \u00e9galement soumis \u00e0 une autre exigence financi\u00e8re, plus rigoureuse que celle impos\u00e9e aux parrains des autres membres de la cat\u00e9gorie \u00ab regroupement familial \u00bb. Pour toutes les demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au titre de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial, le r\u00e9pondant doit fournir des renseignements financiers pour d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il est financi\u00e8rement capable de s\u2019acquitter de ses obligations en vertu de l\u2019engagement d\u2019aide. Selon la province de r\u00e9sidence envisag\u00e9e, le r\u00e9pondant doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il (et son conjoint, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant) a un revenu qui atteint ou d\u00e9passe le seuil de faible revenu (SFR) pour la taille de la famille dans cette r\u00e9gion.\n[254] Dans la pr\u00e9sentation du Comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de CIC de 2011, dat\u00e9e du 30 juin 2011 (pi\u00e8ce 160), diverses options ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tudi\u00e9es pour faire face \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation du nombre de demandes de PGP. L\u2019une des options strat\u00e9giques envisag\u00e9es consistait \u00e0 augmenter le montant du SFR pour les r\u00e9pondants. Les donn\u00e9es pr\u00e9liminaires sugg\u00e8rent que l\u2019augmentation de l\u2019exigence de revenu \u00e0 25 % au-dessus du SFR actuel entra\u00eenerait une r\u00e9duction de 43 % du nombre de demandes re\u00e7ues. L\u2019augmentation de l\u2019exigence \u00e0 40 % au-dessus du SFR entra\u00eenerait une r\u00e9duction de 57 % des demandes de PGP.\n[255] En 2014, le r\u00e8glement sur la LIPR a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ce que la division 133(1)j)(i)(B) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR exige que les r\u00e9pondants PGP aient le revenu minimum n\u00e9cessaire du SFR existant plus 30 % afin d\u2019\u00eatre admissibles. En revanche, en vertu de la division 133(1)j)(i)(A) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, les r\u00e9pondants FC1 sont seulement tenus de d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils ont le revenu minimum n\u00e9cessaire au niveau du SFR existant.\n[256] La source de l\u2019augmentation de la condition de revenu est clairement le r\u00e8glement modifi\u00e9 de la LIPR qui est entr\u00e9 en vigueur le 1er janvier 2014. La source de l\u2019engagement financier plus lourd est \u00e9galement le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. La modification portant l\u2019engagement des promoteurs de PGP de 10 \u00e0 20 ans est \u00e9galement entr\u00e9e en vigueur le 1er janvier 2014.\n[257] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que les modifications r\u00e9glementaires n\u2019ont pas affect\u00e9 M. Attaran et que les preuves montrent qu\u2019il n\u2019a eu aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il disposait du revenu minimum n\u00e9cessaire. Les modifications apport\u00e9es au r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR sont entr\u00e9es en vigueur apr\u00e8s que les parents de M. Attaran eurent obtenu le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent au Canada.\n[258] L\u2019intim\u00e9 fait \u00e9galement valoir que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Attaran sur la dur\u00e9e des engagements n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9 nulle part dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, pas plus que la contestation des exigences relatives au revenu minimum. De plus, il soutient que les changements n\u2019ont pas eu d\u2019effet sur les temps d\u2019attente et qu\u2019ils ne sont pas concern\u00e9s par les faits de cette affaire (par. 214 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9).\n[259] Il est vrai que ces mesures r\u00e9glementaires ont des effets n\u00e9gatifs et diff\u00e9rentiels sur les promoteurs de PGP. L\u2019engagement suppl\u00e9mentaire de 7 \u00e0 17 ans constitue un risque financier plus important pour le parrain et, en tant que tel, il est d\u00e9favorable. Cela pourrait \u00e9galement avoir pour effet de d\u00e9courager certaines personnes de devenir parrains.\n[260] De m\u00eame, l\u2019exigence de revenu minimum pour les parrains de PGP est plus contraignante. L\u2019exigence suppl\u00e9mentaire de 30 % \u00e9liminera sans aucun doute les chances de certains Canadiens qui souhaitent parrainer des membres de leur famille qui sont PGP.\n[261] Ces exigences r\u00e9glementaires sont sans ambigu\u00eft\u00e9. Les nouvelles exigences financi\u00e8res rendent le parrainage plus difficile pour certains parrains potentiels. Toutefois, le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli en quoi l\u2019adoption de ces r\u00e8glements concernait \u00ab [\u2026] le fournisseur \u2026 de services [\u2026] \u00bb, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Le plaignant et la Commission ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements n\u2019est pas le service contest\u00e9 dans cette plainte. Par cons\u00e9quent, les pr\u00e9sents motifs ne permettent pas de d\u00e9terminer si la cr\u00e9ation ou la modification du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR constitue en soi un service.\n[262] La pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e par M. Attaran est plut\u00f4t le fait que le ministre n\u2019a pas utilis\u00e9 le pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 25.2(1) d\u2019exempter les demandeurs de PGP des exigences financi\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9es dans ces r\u00e8glements.\n[263] Mettant de c\u00f4t\u00e9 pour un moment l\u2019objection de l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant la pertinence de la demande du plaignant, le plaignant et la Commission ont mis en cause deux r\u00e8glements sp\u00e9cifiques concernant les exigences financi\u00e8res et affirment que le fait que le ministre n\u2019ait pas exempt\u00e9 tous les demandeurs de PGP de ces exigences constitue une discrimination syst\u00e9mique. Bien qu\u2019elles ne soient pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la demande du plaignant, ces all\u00e9gations se rapportent \u00e0 l\u2019exp\u00e9rience d\u2019autres demandeurs de PGP avec IRCC.\n[264] L\u2019article 14 de la LIPR stipule que le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR peut prescrire et r\u00e9gir toute question relative aux cat\u00e9gories de r\u00e9sidents permanents ou d\u2019\u00e9trangers. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 14(2)c) stipule que le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR peut contenir des dispositions concernant :\n\u00ab le nombre de demandes \u00e0 traiter et dont il peut \u00eatre dispos\u00e9 et celui de visas ou autres documents \u00e0 accorder par an, ainsi que les mesures \u00e0 prendre en cas de d\u00e9passement \u00bb.\n[265] Le plaignant soutient que, lorsque le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR \u00e9tablit une distinction fond\u00e9e sur un motif de distinction illicite, le ministre responsable a l\u2019obligation d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 25.2(1), pour dispenser les demandeurs. Le plaignant affirme que la LCDP l\u2019exige.\n[266] La jurisprudence du Tribunal dans l\u2019affaire Beattie stipule que lorsque les acteurs gouvernementaux ont le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter la l\u00e9gislation de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9viter un traitement d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9 sur un motif illicite, la LCDP exige qu\u2019ils exercent leur pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui va dans ce sens. Dans l\u2019affaire Beattie, un fonctionnaire a choisi d\u2019\u00e9tablir des distinctions entre les enfants biologiques et les enfants adopt\u00e9s selon la coutume lorsqu\u2019il a interpr\u00e9t\u00e9 les dispositions de la Loi sur les Indiens (Beattie, par. 50). Au para. 102 de sa d\u00e9cision, membre Lustig a conclu que \u00ab [l]orsque le libell\u00e9 d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gale comporte quelque ambigu\u00eft\u00e9 susceptible de plus d\u2019une interpr\u00e9tation, le minist\u00e8re responsable de son application est tenu, selon la LCDP, de retenir l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation la plus compatible avec les principes en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne \u00bb.\n[267] Le plaignant s\u2019appuie sur ce principe pour soutenir que le ministre n\u2019est pas strictement li\u00e9 par les articles 132 et 133 du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR parce que du paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR donne au ministre le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9roger aux exigences du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, par. 176).\n[268] Le paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR est libell\u00e9 comme suit :\nS\u00e9jour dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public\n25.2(1) Le ministre peut \u00e9tudier le cas de l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi et lui octroyer le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des crit\u00e8res et obligations applicables, si l\u2019\u00e9tranger remplit toute condition fix\u00e9e par le ministre et que celui-ci estime que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public le justifie.\n[269] Le plaignant pr\u00e9cise ce point en deux arguments. Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019application par IRCC des exigences relatives \u00e0 l\u2019engagement financier et au SFR dans le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR aux demandeurs PGP n\u2019est pas soumise au ratio de Matson\/Andrews parce que le ministre peut utiliser l\u2019article 25.2(1) pour faire des exemptions qui, \u00e9tant des actes discr\u00e9tionnaires, sont n\u00e9cessairement un \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu de la LCDP. Deuxi\u00e8mement, le ministre doit utiliser son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour d\u00e9roger aux exigences du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR qui entra\u00eenent un traitement d\u00e9favorable pour la cat\u00e9gorie des PGP, car la LCDP a pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. Le plaignant soutient cet argument en affirmant que la LCDP est la volont\u00e9 du Parlement et qu\u2019elle a donc pr\u00e9s\u00e9ance sur le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR pour guider le ministre dans l\u2019exercice de son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire.\n[270] Le plaignant soutient que le ministre doit exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu de la LIPR pour accorder des dispenses et, de cette fa\u00e7on, rendre le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR conforme \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il per\u00e7oit comme \u00e9tant la LCDP. En fait, le plaignant soutient que le ministre devrait utiliser le paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR pour exempter tous les demandeurs de PGP de tout traitement d\u00e9favorable au sein de la cat\u00e9gorie de la famille qui est enracin\u00e9e dans le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR et qui entra\u00eene une discrimination syst\u00e9mique, et admettre les demandeurs PGP d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui refl\u00e8te une priorit\u00e9 \u00e9gale \u00e0 celle des autres demandeurs de la cat\u00e9gorie de la famille. (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, paragraphe 177). Autrement, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR n\u2019est pas v\u00e9ritablement contraignant comme la plupart des autres lois parce que le Parlement a accord\u00e9 au ministre le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire ultime, au paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR, de d\u00e9roger aux exigences du r\u00e8glement pour des raisons d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, paragraphe 172).\n[271] Pour \u00e9tayer sa position, le plaignant a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve datant de 2021, selon lesquels le ministre a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu du paragraphe 25.2(1) pour exempter temporairement les r\u00e9pondants PGP des exigences en mati\u00e8re de revenu \u00e9lev\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues par le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application sur la LIPR (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, paragraphe 175). (Ce changement de politique \u00e9tait une r\u00e9ponse aux difficult\u00e9s rencontr\u00e9es pour atteindre les niveaux cibles en raison de la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19. Ce changement de politique n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 entrepris pour d\u00e9passer les objectifs de niveaux fix\u00e9s par le Cabinet.)\n[272] L\u2019utilisation par le ministre du paragraphe 25.2(1) pour exempter l\u2019ensemble des parrains de PGP des exigences habituelles en mati\u00e8re de revenu semble s\u2019\u00e9carter de l\u2019utilisation habituelle de ce r\u00e8glement pour accorder des exemptions \u00e0 des particuliers. Si l\u2019on s\u2019en tient \u00e0 sa simple lecture, il n\u2019est pas \u00e9vident que l\u2019article 25.2(1) ait \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u pour se passer du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR contraignant, en particulier d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui impliquerait l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre pour annuler les r\u00e8glements concernant des cat\u00e9gories enti\u00e8res de personnes ou les plans de niveaux et leur classement par ordre de priorit\u00e9 des cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants. Voici la partie pertinente :\n25.2(1) Le ministre peut \u00e9tudier le cas de l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui est interdit de territoire ou qui ne se conforme pas \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi et lui octroyer le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent ou lever tout ou partie des crit\u00e8res et obligations.[\u2026] (soulignement ajout\u00e9)\n[273] N\u00e9anmoins, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 que le ministre s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur cette disposition discr\u00e9tionnaire en 2021 pour exempter toute une cat\u00e9gorie de personnes de l\u2019obligation de revenu pr\u00e9vue par le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, et le plaignant sugg\u00e8re maintenant qu\u2019elle aurait pu \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re dans le pass\u00e9 pour mettre tout r\u00e8glement en infraction en conformit\u00e9 avec la LCDP.\n[274] Tout en soutenant que le Tribunal devrait conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019effets diff\u00e9rentiels pr\u00e9judiciables en raison du fait que le ministre n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 25.2(1) d\u2019annuler le r\u00e8glement, il importe de rappeler que le plaignant a \u00e9galement fait valoir que le Tribunal [Traduction] \u00ab n\u2019a pas \u00e0 d\u00e9cider et ne devrait pas d\u00e9cider \u00bb si le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR est immunis\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews (m\u00e9moire du plaignant, par. 171, soulignement dans l\u2019original).\n[275] En ce qui concerne le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, l\u2019intim\u00e9 fait valoir que les contestations du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR ne constituent pas un service. Au-del\u00e0 des arguments d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9voqu\u00e9s, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019appuie sur les conclusions de l\u2019affaire Murphy CAF, dans laquelle les contestations de la Loi sur l\u2019assurance-emploi et du R\u00e8glement sur l\u2019assurance-emploi ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es hors du champ d\u2019application de la LCDP. En bref, il soutient que les r\u00e8glements sont des lois subordonn\u00e9es qui attirent le ratio de l\u2019arr\u00eat Matson\/Andrews. Dans l\u2019affaire Matson\/Andrews, la Cour supr\u00eame ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur la question de savoir si les r\u00e8glements sont soumis \u00e0 un examen en vertu de la LCDP. Comme nous l\u2019avons d\u00e9j\u00e0 indiqu\u00e9 dans les pr\u00e9sents motifs, les r\u00e8glements ne constituent pas le service sur lequel le plaignant et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019enqu\u00eater, et ils n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments selon lesquels les r\u00e8glements constituent un service.\n[276] Dans son contexte, le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire accord\u00e9 au ministre en vertu du paragraphe 25.2(1) vise \u00e0 lui permettre de faire des exceptions, de temps \u00e0 autre, pour permettre l\u2019admission de personnes qui peuvent \u00eatre interdites de territoire ou qui ne satisfont pas aux exigences normales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019immigration. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 le plaignant, en 2021, ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 pour exempter tous les parrains potentiels de PGP de la r\u00e9glementation sur les revenus afin de permettre \u00e0 IRCC d\u2019atteindre les fourchettes cibles des plans de niveaux. Il serait inappropri\u00e9 d\u2019interpr\u00e9ter cette utilisation de l\u2019exemption comme une raison de conclure que le paragraphe 25.2(1) donne au ministre le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rendre inop\u00e9rant tout r\u00e8glement qui cr\u00e9e un effet d\u00e9favorable dans lequel un motif illicite est un facteur. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une attaque d\u00e9guis\u00e9e contre le pouvoir du gouvernement d\u2019adopter des r\u00e8glements ayant ce type d\u2019effet. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de trancher sur la question de savoir si l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements est un service, et qu\u2019ils n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019arguments et de preuves concernant ce service, je refuse de trancher cette question.\n[277] Le champ d\u2019application du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du ministre est plus \u00e9troit. Le ministre peut, \u00e0 titre exceptionnel, accorder des d\u00e9rogations \u2013 et il l\u2019a fait, sur la base de preuves. Mais le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire d\u2019accorder des d\u00e9rogations est limit\u00e9 par le r\u00e9gime l\u00e9gislatif et r\u00e9glementaire, y compris les plans de niveaux. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 les arguments du plaignant et de la Commission annuleraient implicitement les r\u00e8glements ou les gammes des plans de niveaux, ils constituent une attaque d\u00e9guis\u00e9e contre ces activit\u00e9s gouvernementales, dont le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 ni d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019elles constituaient des services en vertu de la LCDP.\n[278] Le fait que la LIPR et le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR \u00e9tablissent des distinctions sur la base de motifs illicites a \u00e9t\u00e9 not\u00e9 et confirm\u00e9 \u00e0 maintes reprises dans le droit canadien. Le droit de l\u2019immigration est, de par sa nature m\u00eame, un droit d\u2019exclusion (Kanthasamy c. Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration) 2015 SCC 61 au para. 14.) Il dicte qui est autoris\u00e9 ou non \u00e0 entrer dans notre pays, que ce soit de fa\u00e7on permanente ou temporaire.\n[279] Comme d\u00e9crit ci-dessus, le cadre de la LIPR est tel que la loi n\u2019est qu\u2019un aper\u00e7u de la structure principale du programme. Les d\u00e9tails concernant les personnes admises au Canada en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents sont subordonn\u00e9s au r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR.\n[280] Depuis le d\u00e9but, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR pr\u00e9voit que certains immigrants potentiels sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s en fonction de leur \u00e2ge. L\u2019article 81 de la LIPR d\u00e9finit les diff\u00e9rents points attribu\u00e9s aux demandeurs de statut de travailleur qualifi\u00e9 en fonction de leur \u00e2ge. Les diff\u00e9rents points attribu\u00e9s en fonction de l\u2019\u00e2ge aux demandeurs immigrants ind\u00e9pendants sont \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019article 102.1 du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. L\u2019\u00e2ge est un motif de discrimination illicite en vertu du paragraphe 3(1) de la LCDP.\n[281] Le paragraphe 7(1) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR stipule qu\u2019un \u00e9tranger ne peut pas entrer au Canada pour y s\u00e9journer temporairement sans avoir obtenu au pr\u00e9alable un visa de r\u00e9sidence temporaire. Cependant, il existe une exemption pour certaines personnes, bas\u00e9e sur leur citoyennet\u00e9 (qui dans la plupart des cas implique l\u2019origine nationale) \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans le paragraphe 190(1) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. Les \u00e9trangers qui sont citoyens des pays \u00e9num\u00e9r\u00e9s dans ce r\u00e8glement ou dans l\u2019annexe 1.1 du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR sont dispens\u00e9s de l\u2019obligation d\u2019obtenir un visa de r\u00e9sident temporaire pour visiter le Canada. L\u2019origine nationale est un motif de discrimination illicite en vertu de l\u2019article 3(1) de la LCDP.\n[282] Le ministre n\u2019a pas choisi d\u2019utiliser le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR pour supprimer les distinctions fond\u00e9es sur des motifs illicites, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, dans le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR. Si le Tribunal devait conclure qu\u2019en ne recourant pas \u00e0 une d\u00e9rogation minist\u00e9rielle pour rendre non pertinents le paragraphe 132(1) de la LIPR (concernant la dur\u00e9e des engagements) et la division 133(1)j)(i)(B) de la LIPR (augmentation du SFR), il a enfreint la LCDP, ce r\u00e9sultat semblerait sugg\u00e9rer que le ministre serait \u00e9galement oblig\u00e9 d\u2019accorder des d\u00e9rogations cat\u00e9goriques concernant les articles 81 et 102.1 et le paragraphe 190(1) de la LIPR, et peut-\u00eatre d\u2019autres encore. Cela n\u2019aurait certainement pas pu \u00eatre l\u2019intention du Parlement depuis le d\u00e9but de la r\u00e9daction de la LIPR et de son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application, en s\u00e9parant le cadre des exigences d\u00e9taill\u00e9es. La loi sur l\u2019immigration est par nature excluante et la LIPR et son r\u00e8glement d\u2019application \u00e9tablissent des distinctions parfois fond\u00e9es sur des motifs illicites.\n[283] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019argument du plaignant selon lequel le ministre aurait d\u00fb exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire en vertu du paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR pour rendre les r\u00e8glements \u00ab conformes \u00bb \u00e0 la LCDP doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019attaque contre les r\u00e8glements. Le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements est un service et n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de trancher cette question.\n[284] De plus, je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour dire que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Attaran sur ce r\u00e8glement de la LIPR n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9 nulle part. Cela ne l\u2019a pas emp\u00each\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter une demande et la diff\u00e9rence n\u2019\u00e9tait pas li\u00e9e aux temps d\u2019attente qu\u2019il a subis. La question n\u2019est pas soulev\u00e9e par les faits de son cas.\n[285] Cette all\u00e9gation de pratique discriminatoire est rejet\u00e9e.\nXV. IRCC s\u2019est-il livr\u00e9 aux autres pratiques discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9es lors du traitement des demandes dans la cat\u00e9gorie des PGP?\n[286] Comme nous l\u2019avons vu plus haut, dans sa plainte initiale aupr\u00e8s de la Commission (pi\u00e8ce 1), M. Attaran a d\u00e9crit le [Traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8me fondamental \u00bb comme \u00e9tant le temps n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 CIC pour traiter la partie canadienne de la demande de parrainage pour les PGP. Il a compar\u00e9 les estimations des d\u00e9lais de traitement figurant sur le site Web de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque : Enfants adopt\u00e9s \/ orphelins - quotidiennement ; PGP - 37 mois; et \u00e9poux, partenaires et enfants \u00e0 charge (FC1) - 42 jours.\n[287] Le m\u00e9moire de la CCDP affirme que la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable est [Traduction] \u00ab la pratique d\u2019IRCC consistant \u00e0 traiter les demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente des parents et des grands-parents \u00e0 un rythme beaucoup plus lent... \u00bb (au paragraphe 7). [Traduction] \u00ab Cette plainte porte sur le traitement d\u00e9favorable subi par M. Attaran et ses parents en raison des longs d\u00e9lais de traitement lorsque M. Attaran a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 parrainer ses parents... \u00bb (Ibid., paragraphe 33). La Commission affirme que le service offert par IRCC \u00e9tait le [Traduction] \u00ab traitement de la demande \u00bb qui a commenc\u00e9 lorsque la famille Attaran y a [Traduction] \u00ab acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00bb en soumettant sa demande en 2009. Ils ont ensuite attendu [Traduction] \u00ab pendant plus de trois ans qu\u2019IRCC leur accorde l\u2019avantage \u00bb (par. 26 de la contre-r\u00e9plique suppl\u00e9mentaire de la CCDP).\n[288] Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, apr\u00e8s que les documents de demande \u00e0 jour ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournis au CTD-M, la partie 1 de la demande de parrainage de M. Attaran a \u00e9t\u00e9 approuv\u00e9e le 28 mai 2012, soit seulement 19 jours plus tard. L\u2019ensemble de la demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 finalis\u00e9 le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2012, lorsque les visas de r\u00e9sidence permanente ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9s aux parents de M. Attaran. Le plaignant souligne au paragraphe 38 de son m\u00e9moire que le d\u00e9lai d\u2019attente de 9 mois pour l\u2019examen de la demande \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la norme de service actuelle d\u2019IRCC (12 mois) pour les \u00e9poux, les partenaires et les enfants \u00e0 charge.\n[289] Ces faits soutiennent l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation selon laquelle la plainte de M. Attaran doit porter sur l\u2019ensemble du temps n\u00e9cessaire au traitement de sa plainte, depuis sa r\u00e9ception par IRCC le 8 juillet 2009 jusqu\u2019au 13 d\u00e9cembre 2012 (date \u00e0 laquelle les visas ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9livr\u00e9s). C\u2019est moins de la moiti\u00e9 du d\u00e9lai de traitement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 (42 jours) pour les demandes FC1, auxquelles M. Attaran a compar\u00e9 sa propre demande. Si la plainte ne porte que sur le temps n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9valuation active des parties 1 et 2, entre le 30 mars 2012 et le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2012 (y compris le temps n\u00e9cessaire au M. Attaran et \u00e0 ses parents pour soumettre d\u2019autres documents, les r\u00e9sultats des examens m\u00e9dicaux et les certificats de police), il s\u2019est \u00e9coul\u00e9 moins de neuf mois. Dans les deux cas, il n\u2019y aurait pas eu de traitement d\u00e9favorable d\u00e9montrable sur la base duquel la Commission aurait estim\u00e9 que la plainte justifiait un renvoi devant le Tribunal.\n[290] Il est important de noter cette distinction parce que certains des arguments finaux du plaignant et de la Commission ne font pas la distinction appropri\u00e9e entre le \u00ab d\u00e9lai de traitement \u00bb et le \u00ab d\u00e9lai d\u2019attente pour l\u2019examen de la demande \u00bb, tels que ces termes sont d\u00e9finis ci-dessus. Une distinction claire permet de d\u00e9terminer quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments des retards subis par les demandeurs de PGP peuvent \u00eatre attribu\u00e9s aux effets combin\u00e9s de la LIPR, du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, des plans de niveaux, des instructions minist\u00e9rielles et, \u00e0 leur tour, du traitement des demandes par IRCC conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la LIPR, au r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, aux plans de classement et aux instructions minist\u00e9rielles.\n[291] Le d\u00e9lai de traitement comprend la p\u00e9riode d\u2019attente des demandes dans l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9. L\u2019all\u00e9gation de traitement diff\u00e9rentiel d\u00e9favorable concernant le traitement plus lent des demandes de PGP doit inclure cette p\u00e9riode, car, en son absence, le temps d\u2019attente pour l\u2019examen des demandes subi par le plaignant ne s\u2019est pas traduit par des temps d\u2019attente plus longs.\n[292] Le plaignant et la Commission ont fait valoir que diverses actions et inactions ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 allonger les d\u00e9lais de traitement, notamment le regroupement et la priorisation d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories de demandeurs par la pr\u00e9sentation simultan\u00e9e de demandes de parrainage et de r\u00e9sidence permanente, des d\u00e9lais plus favorables pour les demandes d\u2019examen m\u00e9dical, la priorit\u00e9 accord\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres de la famille (wild-card relatives), l\u2019utilisation de normes de service pour certaines cat\u00e9gories, mais pas pour les PGP, la suspension des demandes de parrainage de PGP au CTD-M en 2004-2005, et le transfert d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ressources des PGP vers les FC1. Chacune de ces questions sera examin\u00e9e ci-dessous.\nA. D\u00e9p\u00f4t simultan\u00e9 des demandes de parrainage et des demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente\n[293] Dans le cadre de l\u2019Initiative de restructuration de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial de 2003-2004, les membres du groupe FC1 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter la partie 2 de leur demande en m\u00eame temps que la demande des r\u00e9pondants de la partie 1. Les t\u00e9moignages recueillis lors de l\u2019audience ont permis de conclure que, lors des tests effectu\u00e9s par CIC, le fait de soumettre les deux parties de la demande d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but a permis de r\u00e9duire de plus de 50 % les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes du groupe FC1 pour les cas courants. La trousse de demande conjointe pour les FC1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 introduite le 28 juin 2002 (voir pi\u00e8ce 63, page 4).\n[294] M. Attaran all\u00e8gue que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement a entra\u00een\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais de traitement plus longs pour les demandeurs de PGP (FC4) comme ses parents. Leur demande au titre de la partie 2 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en m\u00eame temps que la demande de parrainage au titre de la partie 1. Au moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa demande, ses parents devaient attendre l\u2019approbation de la partie 1 de la demande avant d\u2019\u00eatre invit\u00e9s \u00e0 soumettre la partie 2. (Toutefois, cette politique a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e peu de temps avant que la demande d\u2019Attaran ne soit retir\u00e9e de la liste d\u2019attente.)\n[295] Le traitement simplifi\u00e9, qui permettait aux FC1 de soumettre les parties 1 et 2 de leur demande en m\u00eame temps, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019origine pour le sous-groupe des PGP. Toutefois, imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019instruction minist\u00e9rielle no 4 qui a instaur\u00e9 le moratoire sur les demandes de PGP, IRCC a publi\u00e9 le bulletin op\u00e9rationnel no 353 le 7 novembre 2011 (pi\u00e8ce no 81). Ce document confirme qu\u2019\u00e0 compter du 18 juillet 2011, les demandeurs de PGP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9s \u00e0 inclure les parties 1 et 2 de leur demande, refl\u00e9tant ainsi le processus plus rationalis\u00e9 disponible pour les FC1. Le bulletin op\u00e9rationnel 353 indique \u00e9galement que les parrains qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leur demande avant le 18 juillet 2011, comme M. Attaran, doivent \u00eatre contact\u00e9s et pri\u00e9s d\u2019envoyer la partie 2 de la demande, accompagn\u00e9e des documents justificatifs, dans un d\u00e9lai de 90 jours.\n[296] M. Tetford a confirm\u00e9 que la lettre de CIC dat\u00e9e du 30 mars 2012, demandant au M. Attaran de soumettre la partie 2 de la demande (pi\u00e8ce 3), a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e conform\u00e9ment au bulletin d\u2019exploitation 353 et a d\u00e9coul\u00e9 de celui-ci. Le bulletin d\u2019exploitation 353 indique \u00e9galement que les demandeurs qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumis la partie 2 de la demande peuvent \u00eatre invit\u00e9s \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 fournir des formulaires \u00e0 jour. Cela laisse supposer que, si la demande mettait trop de temps \u00e0 \u00eatre finalis\u00e9e, les formulaires de la partie 2 pourraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme p\u00e9rim\u00e9s et non \u00e0 jour, et devraient \u00eatre refaits. (Ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas le cas pour la famille Attaran).\n[297] Comme indiqu\u00e9 plus haut, le Cabinet fixe les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs dans le plan de niveaux pour les FC1 \u00e0 un niveau suffisamment \u00e9lev\u00e9 pour absorber toute la demande pr\u00e9vue au cours de l\u2019ann\u00e9e \u00e0 venir. L\u2019intention est de ne pas soumettre les FC1 \u00e0 des arri\u00e9r\u00e9s et \u00e0 des temps d\u2019attente prolong\u00e9s. Pour les membres de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial FC1, il est raisonnable de conclure que leurs demandes au titre de la partie 2 ne deviendront pas p\u00e9rim\u00e9es si elles restent en suspens pendant une p\u00e9riode prolong\u00e9e. Ainsi, IRCC peut demander la soumission simultan\u00e9e des demandes de la partie 1 et de la partie 2 afin d\u2019\u00e9viter les retards dus \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure de demande en deux \u00e9tapes.\n[298] La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne pr\u00e9sentent pas d\u2019observations portant sp\u00e9cifiquement sur cette all\u00e9gation. Toutefois, l\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne au paragraphe 88 de son m\u00e9moire que l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de tous les immigrants au Canada doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e en fonction des crit\u00e8res de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, de criminalit\u00e9, de sant\u00e9 et de finances. Les demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en vertu de la partie 2 contiennent des renseignements biographiques d\u00e9taill\u00e9s, y compris les adresses et les pays de r\u00e9sidence depuis le 18e anniversaire du demandeur, ainsi qu\u2019une liste de tous les pays o\u00f9 le demandeur a r\u00e9sid\u00e9 pendant plus de six mois. Les informations contenues dans la partie 2 de la demande sont n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 IRCC pour d\u00e9terminer de quels pays les demandeurs doivent fournir des certificats de police. C\u2019est pourquoi il est important que les formulaires de demande de la partie 2 soient \u00e0 jour. Les certificats de police sont n\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019interdiction de territoire potentielle pour cause de criminalit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 36 de la LIPR. Le plaignant n\u2019a pas contest\u00e9 l\u2019article 36 de la LIPR.\n[299] Lorsque les demandes FC1 sont trait\u00e9es dans un d\u00e9lai tr\u00e8s court, la demande de la partie 2 n\u2019est pas p\u00e9rim\u00e9e. Cependant, l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 d\u2019une soumission simultan\u00e9e des parties 1 et 2 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas disponible au moment de la demande de M. Attaran. Si la demande de r\u00e9sidence permanente en vertu de la partie 2 avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en m\u00eame temps que la demande de parrainage en vertu de la partie 1 du PGP en 2009, elle serait certainement p\u00e9rim\u00e9e puisque la demande serait rest\u00e9e en suspens pendant deux ans ou plus. Le demandeur devrait soumettre \u00e0 nouveau une demande actualis\u00e9e au titre de la partie 2 au moment o\u00f9 elle serait pr\u00eate \u00e0 \u00eatre examin\u00e9e par un agent, ce qui repr\u00e9senterait un fardeau suppl\u00e9mentaire pour les demandeurs et un surcro\u00eet d\u2019administration pour IRCC.\n[300] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, M. Attaran n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que le fait de soumettre la demande de la partie 2 simultan\u00e9ment pour les PGP aurait eu un impact sur l\u2019acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration du temps de traitement global de sa demande ou des demandes relatives aux PGP en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. En outre, cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 invoqu\u00e9e dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant ou de la Commission et n\u2019a pas eu d\u2019incidence d\u00e9montrable sur le traitement de sa demande. M\u00eame si j\u2019estimais qu\u2019elle avait eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur la demande de M. Attaran, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas, il serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019accepter cet argument \u00e0 ce stade tardif. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette all\u00e9gation est rejet\u00e9e.\nB. D\u00e9lai plus favorable pour les demandes d\u2019examens m\u00e9dicaux pour les FC1\n[301] Cette all\u00e9gation de traitement d\u00e9favorable est li\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019all\u00e9gation ci-dessus concernant l\u2019autorisation pour les FC1 de soumettre simultan\u00e9ment les deux parties de leur demande \u00e0 l\u2019avance. Le Tribunal a entendu la preuve que, dans le cadre de chaque demande d\u2019immigration, dans toutes les cat\u00e9gories, les demandeurs doivent subir un examen m\u00e9dical. Les preuves ont montr\u00e9 que les examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables pour les FC1 am\u00e9lioraient l\u2019efficacit\u00e9 de la soumission simultan\u00e9e des parties 1 et 2 de la demande. Dans le contexte des examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables autoris\u00e9s pour les FC1, le site Web de l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique ce qui est important : [Traduction] \u00ab Lorsque CIC a test\u00e9 le processus de demande conjointe et d\u2019examen m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9alable, les d\u00e9lais de traitement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9duits de plus de 50 % pour les cas courants \u00bb (pi\u00e8ce 63, page 4).\n[302] M. Tetford a expliqu\u00e9 au Tribunal que dans le cadre de l\u2019initiative de refonte de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale de 2002-2004, il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que les demandeurs de la cat\u00e9gorie FC1 pourraient passer leur examen m\u00e9dical \u00e0 l\u2019avance, avant la pr\u00e9sentation de la demande par leur parrain. Les raisons \u00e9taient doubles. Premi\u00e8rement, les parrains FC1 pouvaient soumettre les parties 1 et 2 de la demande en m\u00eame temps. Deuxi\u00e8mement, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les objectifs du plan des niveaux visent \u00e0 absorber toute la demande, il y avait une pr\u00e9somption que les demandes seraient examin\u00e9es rapidement. La partie 2 de la demande serait examin\u00e9e imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019approbation de la partie 1, ce qui, \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, prenait en moyenne 42 jours dans la plupart des cas. Ainsi, l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical et l\u2019examen des r\u00e9sultats par IRCC pouvaient avoir lieu simultan\u00e9ment.\n[303] Les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical ne sont valables que pendant 12 mois (voir le paragraphe 30(3) de la LIPR). \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que le temps de traitement de la partie 1 de la demande pour les FC1 a \u00e9t\u00e9 achev\u00e9 en quelques semaines, il \u00e9tait peu probable que les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical expirent avant que le traitement de la partie 2 de la demande ne soit achev\u00e9 et que les visas de r\u00e9sident permanent ne puissent \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9s. Le fait d\u2019autoriser les examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables pour les FC1 a permis d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019\u00e9ventuels retards si les examens m\u00e9dicaux n\u2019avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9s qu\u2019\u00e0 un stade ult\u00e9rieur de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[304] La pi\u00e8ce 3 (la partie 2 de la demande du plaignant) contient une lettre de l\u2019intim\u00e9 au p\u00e8re de M. Attaran dat\u00e9e du 23 juillet 2012. Cette lettre comprend ce qui semble \u00eatre un contenu standard, dont une partie se lit comme suit :\n[Traduction]\nTous les demandeurs qui souhaitent obtenir la r\u00e9sidence permanente au Canada doivent satisfaire aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019inadmissibilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale du Canada. Afin de d\u00e9terminer votre admissibilit\u00e9 m\u00e9dicale au Canada, vous et votre conjoint devez subir un examen m\u00e9dical. Cet examen est n\u00e9cessaire, que votre conjoint vous accompagne ou non au Canada.\nVeuillez remettre cette lettre et le formulaire de rapport m\u00e9dical IMM1017 ci-joint pour vous-m\u00eame et votre conjoint au m\u00e9decin qui effectue l\u2019examen. Vous et votre conjoint devez \u00eatre examin\u00e9s par le m\u00eame m\u00e9decin.\nNOTE : Les examens m\u00e9dicaux effectu\u00e9s avant cette demande ne sont pas acceptables aux fins d\u2019immigration au Canada.\n(soulignement et gras dans l\u2019original)\n[305] Le fait que les FC1 aient \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 passer leurs examens m\u00e9dicaux \u00e0 l\u2019avance, sans attendre une demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, est consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable relativement au groupe des PGP, y compris aux parents de M. Attaran. M. Attaran soutient \u00e9galement que les demandeurs d\u2019immigration plus \u00e2g\u00e9s sont plus susceptibles de d\u00e9velopper des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge qui pourraient les rendre inadmissibles. Ainsi, le fait de retarder leur examen m\u00e9dical les rend plus vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 ce risque. Au para. 155 de son m\u00e9moire, M. Attaran affirme qu\u2019un examen m\u00e9dical initial [Traduction] \u00ab garantit un certificat de bonne sant\u00e9 \u00bb et que les PGP ne craindraient pas les cons\u00e9quences d\u2019une maladie pendant qu\u2019ils attendent leur tour dans l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 d\u2019IRCC.\n[306] La Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations sur cette all\u00e9gation de diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable. Dans le cadre des exigences g\u00e9n\u00e9rales applicables \u00e0 tous les immigrants, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait observer que le paragraphe 30(3) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR exige que l\u2019examen m\u00e9dical ait eu lieu au plus tard douze mois avant la date \u00e0 laquelle une personne vient au Canada pour y obtenir le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent (par. 89 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9).\n[307] Le fait que les demandeurs de PGP n\u2019aient pas acc\u00e8s aux examens m\u00e9dicaux initiaux est une cons\u00e9quence logique du sous-alin\u00e9a 72(1)e)(iii) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR et du fait que les fourchettes du plan de niveaux des PGP ne r\u00e9pondent pas \u00e0 la demande. Ce paragraphe du r\u00e8glement de la LIPR exige que tous les \u00e9trangers, au moment o\u00f9 ils arrivent au Canada avec leur visa de r\u00e9sident permanent, afin d\u2019obtenir le droit d\u2019\u00e9tablissement et de devenir r\u00e9sident permanent \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, soient en possession d\u2019un certificat m\u00e9dical fond\u00e9 sur un examen m\u00e9dical qui a eu lieu au cours des 12 mois pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents. M. Tetford a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables n\u2019\u00e9taient pas autoris\u00e9s en 2009 parce qu\u2019ils savaient que la finalisation de la partie 2 des demandes de PGP dans les 12 mois \u00e9tait pr\u00e9visible et impossible (examen direct du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2021 \u00e0 02:11:30.)\n[308] Si les parents de M. Attaran avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 passer leurs examens m\u00e9dicaux d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part, en juillet 2009, ces r\u00e9sultats m\u00e9dicaux auraient expir\u00e9 depuis longtemps avant que leurs visas de r\u00e9sident permanent ne soient pr\u00eats \u00e0 \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9s en d\u00e9cembre 2012. Ils auraient d\u00fb subir de nouveaux examens m\u00e9dicaux dans un d\u00e9lai qui aurait donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 le temps de finaliser leur demande, de d\u00e9livrer leurs visas et de donner aux Attaran le temps d\u2019arriver physiquement au Canada pour \u00ab atterrir \u00bb avec les visas avant le d\u00e9lai de 12 mois (par. 89 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9).\n[309] En fait, cette all\u00e9gation est une attaque d\u00e9guis\u00e9e contre les r\u00e8glements de la LIPR et\/ou les plans des niveaux. Le fait que les examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9s pour les PGP \u00e9tait le r\u00e9sultat d\u2019autres facteurs, comme le d\u00e9lai d\u2019attente de l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9, qui ont fait que le d\u00e9lai de traitement a dur\u00e9 plus de 12 mois. Au vu du paragraphe 30(3) et du sous-alin\u00e9a 72(1)e)(iii) du r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, il est clair que le fait d\u2019autoriser les examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables pour les demandeurs de PGP n\u2019aurait pas acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes et n\u2019aurait pas non plus \u00ab verrouill\u00e9 \u00bb l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 d\u2019un demandeur au moment de sa demande initiale. Ils auraient toujours d\u00fb passer ces examens m\u00e9dicaux vers la fin du traitement de leur demande pour s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient dans les 12 mois avant l\u2019obtention de leur visa.\n[310] Le plaignant n\u2019a donc pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que les actions de l\u2019intim\u00e9 relatives au calendrier des examens m\u00e9dicaux ont contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 allonger les d\u00e9lais de traitement des PGP ou qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9judiciables \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9gards. L\u2019expiration de 12 mois pr\u00e9vue par le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR a emp\u00each\u00e9 de \u00ab bloquer \u00bb un r\u00e9sultat m\u00e9dical pr\u00e9coce. Compte tenu des contraintes impos\u00e9es par le plan des niveaux qui ont emp\u00each\u00e9 un traitement \u00e0 la demande similaire \u00e0 celui des FC1, cette all\u00e9gation est, en fait, une attaque d\u00e9guis\u00e9e contre les r\u00e8glements et les plans des niveaux. En outre, cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant ou de la Commission. M\u00eame si j\u2019estimais qu\u2019elle avait eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur la demande de M. Attaran, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas, il serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019accepter cet argument \u00e0 ce stade tardif. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette all\u00e9gation est rejet\u00e9e.\nC. Donner la priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 d\u2019autres membres de la famille (wild card relatives)\n[311] En vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 117(1)h) du r\u00e8glement de la LIPR, il existe une cat\u00e9gorie de membres de famille qui peuvent \u00eatre parrain\u00e9s pour l\u2019immigration si certaines conditions sont remplies. Ces membres de la famille comprennent les cousins, les neveux, les tantes et d\u2019autres personnes qui, normalement, ne seraient pas admissibles \u00e0 l\u2019immigration dans la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial. Les conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 sont que le r\u00e9pondant canadien ne doit pas avoir de parents proches au Canada et qu\u2019il ne peut parrainer personne dans les sous-groupes FC1 ou PGP. IRCC appelle ce groupe les autres membres de la famille (wild card relatives).\n[312] Compte tenu des conditions d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9, le nombre de parrains canadiens potentiels est assez restreint. M. Attaran a cit\u00e9 la pi\u00e8ce 64 pour citer le sous-ministre de l\u2019\u00e9poque, M. Yeates, qui a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab Peu de demandes de ce type sont re\u00e7ues et, en raison des circonstances uniques de ces relations, elles b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019une plus grande priorit\u00e9 de traitement \u00bb. En contre-interrogatoire, M. Tetford a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les autres membres de la famille au sens de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 117(1)h) \u00e9taient trait\u00e9s en m\u00eame temps que les demandeurs FC1 dans le cadre du processus de traitement acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9. Il a admis que ces parents pouvaient \u00eatre plus \u00e9loign\u00e9s qu\u2019un parent ou un grand-parent, comme un cousin. Toutefois, ces demandes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es beaucoup plus rapidement que les demandes de parrainage de PGP. Rien ne permet d\u2019expliquer pourquoi les demandes concernant d\u2019autres membres de la famille ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es plus rapidement, si ce n\u2019est qu\u2019elles \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s peu nombreuses.\n[313] La pi\u00e8ce 65, une lettre de la sous-ministre Marta Morgan \u00e0 la Commission dat\u00e9e du 7 juillet 2016 sur la plainte de M. Attaran, confirme que le nombre de demandes de parrainage concernant d\u2019autres membres de la famille re\u00e7ues en 2010 \u00e9tait de 1002. En comparaison, le nombre de demandes de parrainage de PGP re\u00e7ues cette ann\u00e9e-l\u00e0 \u00e9tait de 39 886 personnes.\n[314] Dans ses observations, M. Attaran fait remarquer que les autres membres de la famille ne font pas partie de la famille nucl\u00e9aire et comprennent des parents plus \u00e9loign\u00e9s que les parents ou les grands-parents. Cependant, ils sont trait\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9 comme s\u2019ils faisaient partie de la famille nucl\u00e9aire. M. Attaran soutient qu\u2019au sein m\u00eame de la famille \u00e9largie, les autres membres de la famille b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient d\u2019un traitement plus rapide que le sous-groupe des PGP, ce qui constitue une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[315] La Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations sur cette all\u00e9gation concernant le traitement des demandes concernant d\u2019autres membres de la famille. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est content\u00e9 d\u2019observer les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (au paragraphe 103 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9) selon lesquels le nombre d\u2019immigrants faisant partie des autres membres de la famille n\u2019a pas d\u00e9pass\u00e9 500 au cours de chacune des cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es.\n[316] La source de cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement entre les autres membres de la famille et les PGP semble \u00eatre la politique interne de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR ne pr\u00e9cise pas de quelle mani\u00e8re les demandes concernant d\u2019autres membres de la famille doivent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es. Leur s\u00e9paration dans le flux de traitement plus rapide \u00e9tait en place avant la cr\u00e9ation des instructions minist\u00e9rielles. Ils ne sont pas identifi\u00e9s comme un sous-groupe distinct dans le plan des niveaux.\n[317] Le r\u00e8glement de la LIPR d\u00e9crit les PGP aux alin\u00e9as 117(1)c) et d). Ils sont exclus de la d\u00e9finition d\u2019autres membres de la famille \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 117(1)h). Les autres membres de la famille ne sont pas soumis aux limites pr\u00e9vues par les plans de niveaux qui s\u2019appliquent aux PGP. Il n\u2019y a donc pas d\u2019obstacle \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils soient trait\u00e9s sur demande. M. Attaran a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 un traitement plus favorable des autres membres de la famille, relativement peu nombreux, lors du traitement. Toutefois, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les PGP ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9s de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, compte tenu d\u2019une d\u00e9finition r\u00e9glementaire distincte et de l\u2019application des plans de niveaux qui s\u2019appliquent aux PGP, l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire en traitant diff\u00e9remment les autres membres de la famille.\n[318] En outre, cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 plaid\u00e9e dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions du plaignant ou de la Commission. M\u00eame si j\u2019estimais qu\u2019elle avait eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur la demande de M. Attaran, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas, il serait pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019accepter cet argument \u00e0 ce stade tardif. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette all\u00e9gation est rejet\u00e9e.\nD. Normes de service\n[319] M. Attaran all\u00e8gue que les demandeurs de PGP, dont ses parents, ont fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable parce qu\u2019aucune \u00ab norme de service \u00bb n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie pour ce sous-groupe de la cat\u00e9gorie du \u00ab regroupement familial \u00bb. En revanche, l\u2019initiative de refonte du regroupement familial 2002-2003 a \u00e9tabli une norme de service pour le traitement des demandes FC1.\n[320] M. Cardinal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que les normes de service sont demand\u00e9es par le Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor pour donner aux gens une id\u00e9e raisonnable du temps qu\u2019il faudra aux divers organismes gouvernementaux pour fournir leurs services. IRCC a articul\u00e9 ses normes de service en indiquant le pourcentage de demandes qu\u2019il s\u2019attendait \u00e0 traiter dans un certain d\u00e9lai. Au moment de la refonte, une norme de service officielle a \u00e9t\u00e9 cr\u00e9\u00e9e pour les demandes FC1 et d\u2019autres types de demandes d\u2019immigration, mais non pour les PGP. M. Cardinal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il pensait que des normes de service \u00e9taient en place pour plus de 50 % des sous-cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigration.\n[321] M. Tetford a confirm\u00e9 lors du contre-interrogatoire qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 M. Attaran a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 sa demande de parrainage, il n\u2019existait pas encore de norme de service pour les PGP. D\u2019apr\u00e8s les souvenirs de M. Tetford, la norme de service en vigueur \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque pour les demandes FC1 consistait \u00e0 traiter la demande de parrainage au titre de la partie 1 en 30 \u00e0 40 jours.\n[322] Dans ses conclusions finales, la Commission fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 la pi\u00e8ce 174, qui est un rapport d\u2019IRCC pour 2019-2020 d\u00e9crivant les normes de service pour diverses sous-cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants. Dans ce document, \u00e9galement disponible sur le site Web d\u2019IRCC, l\u2019intim\u00e9 annonce des normes de service pour les \u00e9poux, les conjoints de fait et les enfants \u00e0 charge de la cat\u00e9gorie de la famille \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, mais ne mentionne aucune norme de service pour les parents et les grands-parents. Le document poursuit en indiquant les normes de service de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour d\u2019autres cat\u00e9gories d\u2019immigrants, telles que la cat\u00e9gorie de l\u2019exp\u00e9rience canadienne, la cat\u00e9gorie des travailleurs qualifi\u00e9s (f\u00e9d\u00e9ral), les demandeurs du programme des candidats des provinces, les travailleurs qualifi\u00e9s s\u00e9lectionn\u00e9s par le Qu\u00e9bec et le programme des m\u00e9tiers.\n[323] Au cours de son interrogatoire principal et de son contre-interrogatoire par la Commission, on a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Cardinal pourquoi aucune norme de service n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie pour le sous-groupe PGP. M. Cardinal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le programme PGP n\u2019\u00e9tait pas \u00ab stable \u00bb en raison des nombreux changements qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en \u0153uvre, d\u2019une ann\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019autre, et qui ont modifi\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont le programme \u00e9tait administr\u00e9. Les changements apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont la r\u00e9serve est r\u00e9duite et les changements apport\u00e9s \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont la r\u00e9ception des demandes est g\u00e9r\u00e9e sont des facteurs qui ont fait qu\u2019IRCC n\u2019a pas mis en \u0153uvre des normes de service pour le sous-groupe PGP. En revanche, la pi\u00e8ce 174 montre une norme de service pour les FC1 de 12 mois pour le traitement de 80 % des demandes, qui est en place depuis 2010.\n[324] M. Attaran et la Commission soutiennent que l\u2019absence de normes de service pour les PGP, alors qu\u2019elles existent pour d\u2019autres membres de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale, constitue une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable qui se traduit par des d\u00e9lais de traitement plus longs.\n[325] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les normes de service sont utilis\u00e9es par IRCC pour donner aux gens [Traduction] \u00ab une id\u00e9e fiable du temps qu\u2019ils devront attendre pour recevoir un service \u00bb. Il oppose cela au d\u00e9lai de traitement, qui est bas\u00e9 sur des donn\u00e9es mesurant le temps qu\u2019il faut effectivement \u00e0 IRCC pour traiter une demande (voir paragraphe 143 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9).\n[326] Selon le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cardinal, l\u2019obligation de cr\u00e9er des normes de service \u00e9tait une demande du Conseil du Tr\u00e9sor. Toutefois, IRCC avait le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de cr\u00e9er ou non une norme de service pour diverses cat\u00e9gories de demandes d\u2019immigration. J\u2019accepte l\u2019explication de M. Cardinal selon laquelle les normes de service pour les PGP n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablies parce que le programme \u00e9tait soumis \u00e0 des changements fr\u00e9quents, en particulier au moyen de diff\u00e9rentes instructions minist\u00e9rielles.\n[327] Les donn\u00e9es ont montr\u00e9 que les normes de service associ\u00e9es \u00e0 la dur\u00e9e de traitement varient selon les cat\u00e9gories de demandes d\u2019immigration. Cet \u00e9cart s\u2019explique par des priorit\u00e9s diff\u00e9rentes, par le plan des niveaux et par d\u2019autres facteurs externes. Les normes de service en vigueur sont ambitieuses par nature, mais soumises aux facteurs susmentionn\u00e9s.\n[328] La Commission demande que l\u2019on rem\u00e9die aux normes de service pour les PGP [Traduction] \u00ab en parit\u00e9 avec les autres cat\u00e9gories de familles \u00bb (paragraphe 127 du m\u00e9moire de la Commission), mais cette demande ignore les facteurs externes qui dicteront ce qui est m\u00eame possible. Comme l\u2019a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 M. Cardinal, les demandes de PGP, de par leur nature, prennent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement plus de temps \u00e0 traiter. Les examens m\u00e9dicaux doivent plus souvent \u00eatre approfondis ou refaits, et il faut souvent plus de temps pour obtenir des certificats de naissance, de mariage et de divorce plus anciens. Les PGP mettent plus de temps \u00e0 renvoyer les documents demand\u00e9s. (Examen direct de M. Cardinal le 20 septembre 2021 \u00e0 03:48:42. Voir \u00e9galement la pi\u00e8ce 127, note de service au ministre \u00e0 l\u2019annexe B,page 4.)\n[329] M. Attaran et la Commission n\u2019ont pas prouv\u00e9 que l\u2019absence de normes de service \u00e9tait un facteur qui, plus probablement qu\u2019autrement, ralentissait le traitement des demandes dans la sous-cat\u00e9gorie des PGP. Dans le cas du plaignant, la preuve a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le temps d\u2019attente pour l\u2019examen de sa demande de parrainage en vertu de la partie 1 \u00e9tait de 19 jours. Ce d\u00e9lai \u00e9tait inf\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la moiti\u00e9 de l\u2019estimation de 42 jours figurant sur le site Web d\u2019IRCC pour le traitement des demandes de la partie 1 de la cat\u00e9gorie FC1 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque. Bien que l\u2019absence de normes de service pour les PGP constitue une diff\u00e9rence de traitement, le plaignant n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait d\u2019une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable. Cette all\u00e9gation est rejet\u00e9e.\nE. Le traitement des demandes de parrainage de PGP au CTD-Mississauga a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu de mai 2004 \u00e0 septembre 2005.\n[330] Dans son m\u00e9moire, M. Attaran a cr\u00e9\u00e9 un graphique au paragraphe 69 pour illustrer la fa\u00e7on dont les d\u00e9lais de traitement des PGP ont rapidement diverg\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais de traitement des FC1 au fil du temps. Jusqu\u2019en 2003, les d\u00e9lais de traitement \u00e9taient tr\u00e8s proches les uns des autres. Au para. 145 de son m\u00e9moire, il all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a utilis\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour suspendre le traitement des demandes de PGP au CTD-M pendant 16 mois, ce qui a grandement contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019augmentation.\n[331] Au cours de son contre-interrogatoire par M. Attaran, M. Tetford a parl\u00e9 de la suspension du traitement des demandes FC4 (PGP) de mai 2004 \u00e0 septembre 2005 et a reconnu que c\u2019\u00e9tait l\u2019une des raisons pour lesquelles les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes de parrainage PGP ont augment\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re aussi spectaculaire, comme l\u2019illustre le tableau de M. Attaran.\n[332] Le Tribunal a de nouveau pris connaissance de la pi\u00e8ce 18, le document de politique du CIC de juin 2007, qui se lit comme suit au deuxi\u00e8me paragraphe de la page 15 :\n[Traduction]\nTroisi\u00e8mement, le traitement des demandes de parrainage de parents et de grands-parents au CTD-M a \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendu entre mai 2004 et septembre 2005. Cette mesure a \u00e9t\u00e9 prise afin de consacrer les ressources op\u00e9rationnelles au traitement des demandes des conjoints et des personnes \u00e0 charge. Alors que la r\u00e9serve des demandes FC4 au CTD-M en 2002-2003 \u00e9tait de 3 347 et que le d\u00e9lai de traitement n\u2019\u00e9tait que de 38 jours, lorsque le traitement a repris en septembre 2005, la r\u00e9serve des demandes FC4 \u00e9tait pass\u00e9e \u00e0 81 593 et le d\u00e9lai de traitement \u00e9tait de 2,3 ans.\n[333] M. Attaran a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Tetford si, pendant cette p\u00e9riode ou pendant le moratoire de 2011 \u00e0 2014, d\u2019autres sous-cat\u00e9gories de la cat\u00e9gorie du regroupement familial ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendues. M. Tetford r\u00e9pond par la n\u00e9gative et pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019en 2004-2005, le CTD-M a suspendu le traitement des demandes d\u00e9j\u00e0 inscrites dans la r\u00e9serve et de celles qui continuaient d\u2019arriver. Pendant le moratoire de 2011 \u00e0 2014, IRCC n\u2019a pas accept\u00e9 de nouvelles demandes de parrainage de PGP.\n[334] La Commission n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 d\u2019observations sur cette all\u00e9gation. Dans son dernier argument, l\u2019intim\u00e9 affirme qu\u2019IRCC a cess\u00e9 de traiter les demandes de parrainage au CTD-M en 2004-2005 parce que, sinon, elle aurait inutilement d\u00e9plac\u00e9 l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9 vers les bureaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui traitent les demandes de r\u00e9sidence permanente en vertu de la partie 2. Il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une r\u00e9serve accumul\u00e9e dans ces bureaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, de sorte que le fait de continuer \u00e0 traiter les cas au CTD-M pendant cette p\u00e9riode n\u2019aurait pas permis d\u2019all\u00e9ger l\u2019arri\u00e9r\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas possible pour le CTD-M de simplement cesser d\u2019accepter de nouvelles demandes de parrainage sans l\u2019intervention du Parlement ou du Cabinet (par. 116 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9).\n[335] Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9. Si certaines mesures avaient pu \u00eatre prises pour r\u00e9duire la demande, je n\u2019ai vu aucune preuve qu\u2019IRCC avait le pouvoir de refuser cat\u00e9goriquement l\u2019acceptation de nouvelles demandes jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019introduction des instructions minist\u00e9rielles en 2008.\n[336] \u00c0 mon avis, la suspension du traitement des demandes de PGP de mai 2004 \u00e0 septembre 2005 a constitu\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement. Toutefois, il n\u2019y a pas suffisamment de preuves pour conclure, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que la suspension d\u2019IRCC a contribu\u00e9 au temps total de traitement d\u2019une demande de PGP jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la d\u00e9livrance d\u2019un visa. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, en 2004-2005, il y avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 suffisamment de dossiers en r\u00e9serve dans les bureaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger pour atteindre les objectifs de traitement. La suspension du traitement au CTD-M n\u2019a fait que maintenir les dossiers en attente au Canada plut\u00f4t que dans les bureaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger. Les mesures prises par le CTD-M pour suspendre le traitement ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prises en r\u00e9ponse aux objectifs d\u2019admission des PGP fix\u00e9s par le plan des niveaux, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duits pour 2004 et 2005. La source de cette action \u00e9tait le plan des niveaux. De plus, j\u2019estime que l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle cette politique \u00e9tait pr\u00e9judiciable est trop \u00e9loign\u00e9e de la date de la plainte de M. Attaran. L\u2019impact que la suspension aurait pu avoir sur les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes de PGP quatre ans plus tard est trop sp\u00e9culatif pour \u00eatre examin\u00e9 davantage.\nF. D\u00e9placement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des ressources au d\u00e9triment des PGP avec l\u2019initiative de refonte de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale en 2002-2004, qui a conduit au \u00ab traitement prioritaire \u00bb des FC1.\n[337] Il cite un autre passage de la pi\u00e8ce 18, le document de CIC de 2007 intitul\u00e9 \u00ab Policy Approaches for the Future of the Parents and Grandparents Category \u00bb r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Tracey Bender de la Division de la politique sociale et des programmes, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019immigration. Le premier paragraphe de la page 15 de ce document se lit comme suit :\n[Traduction]\nDeuxi\u00e8mement, en avril 2003, un traitement prioritaire dans les six mois a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place pour les conjoints et les enfants \u00e0 charge. Il a \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de r\u00e9duire les fourchettes d\u2019objectifs pour les parents et les grands-parents en 2004 et 2005 afin de transf\u00e9rer les ressources op\u00e9rationnelles vers le traitement des conjoints et des enfants. En cons\u00e9quence, le nombre de parents et de grands-parents admis en 2004 et 2005 a \u00e9t\u00e9 le plus bas depuis 11 ans (12 732 et 12 471 respectivement).\n[338] M. Attaran a \u00e9galement \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont IRCC a [Traduction] \u00ab sous-estim\u00e9 \u00bb les fourchettes des plans de niveaux pour les PGP de 2007 \u00e0 2010. M. Attaran all\u00e8gue que ce transfert d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 de ressources op\u00e9rationnelles, du traitement des demandes de PGP \u00e0 celui des conjoints et des enfants, \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[339] Je reconnais que le transfert de ressources a entra\u00een\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement du sous-groupe des PGP. Toutefois, comme nous l\u2019avons vu plus haut, le service contest\u00e9 est le traitement des demandes par IRCC, qui implique la mise en \u0153uvre des fourchettes des plans de niveaux fix\u00e9es par le Cabinet. Les plans de niveaux sont-ils \u00e0 l\u2019origine de la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable? IRCC a-t-il simplement mis en \u0153uvre les priorit\u00e9s inh\u00e9rentes aux fourchettes cibles fix\u00e9es pour les FC1 par rapport aux PGP, tout en faisant face \u00e0 une forte demande de parrainage de PGP?\n[340] En 2002, l\u2019objectif sup\u00e9rieur pour les PGP dans le plan des niveaux \u00e9tait de 21 000. En 2004, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ramen\u00e9 \u00e0 13 500. Pour 2005, le plan des niveaux des admissions de PGP pr\u00e9voyait une fourchette de 5 500 \u00e0 6 800. En 2005, il y a eu un toll\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et les niveaux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 port\u00e9s \u00e0 17 500-18 800. (Voir pi\u00e8ce 160, pr\u00e9sentation du comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif de CIC dat\u00e9e du 30 juin 2011, annexe C et notes.)\n[341] Comme le souligne \u00e0 juste titre Mme Bender, le plan des niveaux pour 2004 et 2005 a consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duit les fourchettes cibles pour les PGP. IRCC a trait\u00e9 les demandes au cours de ces ann\u00e9es de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 se situer dans les fourchettes cibles du plan des niveaux. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette r\u00e9orientation des ressources op\u00e9rationnelles, qui a conduit au traitement prioritaire des FC1, d\u00e9coule des objectifs fix\u00e9s dans le plan de niveaux. Par cons\u00e9quent, cette all\u00e9gation est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 une attaque contre le plan des niveaux pour ces ann\u00e9es. En outre, ce changement est largement ant\u00e9rieur \u00e0 la demande de la famille Attaran. Je ne pense pas que le plaignant et la Commission aient \u00e9tabli une pratique discriminatoire selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cette pratique discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9e ne sera pas examin\u00e9e davantage.\n[342] En ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation de d\u00e9passement des objectifs en 2007-2010, les donn\u00e9es mentionn\u00e9es par le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tablissent pas l\u2019existence d\u2019une pratique discriminatoire. En 2010, IRCC a en fait obtenu 334 PGP de plus que l\u2019objectif minimum de 15 000. Au cours des ann\u00e9es 2007, 2008 et 2009, l\u2019objectif minimum pour les PGP n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint, mais seulement par une moyenne de 8,2 % en dessous de l\u2019objectif. Le plaignant a fourni des donn\u00e9es pour certaines autres cat\u00e9gories au cours de ces ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 les d\u00e9barquements r\u00e9els ont d\u00e9pass\u00e9 l\u2019objectif maximal. Toutefois, apr\u00e8s un examen plus approfondi, le d\u00e9passement moyen pour ces 3 ou 4 cat\u00e9gories diff\u00e9rentes cit\u00e9es pour ces ann\u00e9es n\u2019est que de 11,3 %. J\u2019estime que cela est coh\u00e9rent avec la preuve que le respect de la fourchette cible n\u2019a pas toujours \u00e9t\u00e9 atteint malgr\u00e9 tous les efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s. Le degr\u00e9 de sous-d\u00e9passement ou de d\u00e9passement semble se situer dans une marge d\u2019erreur raisonnable. (Les diverses autres cat\u00e9gories non cit\u00e9es par M. Attaran se situaient en dessous ou \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur des fourchettes cibles). Les variations cit\u00e9es ne sont pas grossi\u00e8rement incompatibles avec le plan des niveaux. D\u2019autre part, pour admettre les PGP au Canada sur demande, au m\u00eame titre que les FC1, il aurait fallu d\u00e9passer les fourchettes cibles par des marges \u00e9normes, ce qui, je l\u2019ai constat\u00e9 (plus haut), n\u2019est pas une option qui s\u2019offre \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 dans le cadre du r\u00e9gime impos\u00e9 par la LIPR, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR et les plans des niveaux.\nG. La mani\u00e8re dont IRCC a communiqu\u00e9 au public les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes de PGP constituait-elle une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable dans le cadre de la prestation d\u2019un service?\n[343] Au cours de l\u2019audience, le Tribunal a entendu des t\u00e9moignages sur les diff\u00e9rentes fa\u00e7ons dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 rend compte au public des d\u00e9lais de traitement pour les divers sous-groupes de demandes d\u2019immigration. Certains rapports sont bas\u00e9s sur la dur\u00e9e r\u00e9elle du traitement. Par exemple, le rapport peut indiquer que [Traduction] \u00ab les demandes approuv\u00e9es aujourd\u2019hui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 soumises \u00e0 la date X \u00bb. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019un rapport r\u00e9trospectif sur les d\u00e9lais r\u00e9els. Il ne s\u2019agit pas n\u00e9cessairement d\u2019un bon indicateur du temps qu\u2019il faudrait pour traiter un nouveau dossier soumis aujourd\u2019hui, car l\u2019effet de facteurs tels que les contr\u00f4les \u00e0 l\u2019entr\u00e9e n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement apparent. Dans d\u2019autres cas, l\u2019intim\u00e9 donne une estimation prospective du temps n\u00e9cessaire pour traiter un certain type de demande.\n[344] Cette all\u00e9gation a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans le m\u00e9moire de r\u00e9ponse de M. Attaran, qui cite un aveu au paragraphe 133 du m\u00e9moire de l\u2019intim\u00e9, selon lequel IRCC a modifi\u00e9 sa fa\u00e7on de calculer les d\u00e9lais de traitement des PGP. Selon les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9, apr\u00e8s la mise en \u0153uvre des contr\u00f4les \u00e0 l\u2019arriv\u00e9e pour les PGP, le CTD-Mississauga a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier de mani\u00e8re plus approfondie si les demandes \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tes d\u00e8s leur r\u00e9ception. Si IRCC constatait qu\u2019il manquait des documents, il les demandait au demandeur. Toutefois, le d\u00e9lai de traitement de la demande n\u2019est calcul\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de la date \u00e0 laquelle tous les documents requis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7us par IRCC, plut\u00f4t qu\u2019\u00e0 partir de la date \u00e0 laquelle la demande incompl\u00e8te a \u00e9t\u00e9 re\u00e7ue. Ainsi, le temps pass\u00e9 par IRCC \u00e0 attendre que le demandeur fournisse les documents manquants ne serait pas inclus dans les d\u00e9lais de traitement d\u00e9clar\u00e9s.\n[345] M. Attaran affirme que le fait de retarder le d\u00e9but du d\u00e9lai jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que les demandes de PGP soient compl\u00e8tes, plut\u00f4t que d\u2019utiliser la date de r\u00e9ception des demandes incompl\u00e8tes (comme c\u2019est le cas pour les demandes de FC1), signifie que les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes de parrainage d\u2019IRCC pour les demandes de PGP sont sous-\u00e9valu\u00e9s. [Traduction] \u00ab En d\u2019autres termes, IRCC falsifie ses d\u00e9lais d\u2019attente afin de rendre moins flagrante la diff\u00e9rence avec les \u00e9poux, les partenaires et les enfants \u00bb (m\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse du plaignant, paragraphe 55).\n[346] Je reconnais que les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des rapports \u00e9taient diff\u00e9rentes pour les PGP et pour le sous-groupe FC1. Toutefois, je ne suis pas persuad\u00e9 que les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019\u00e9tablissement des rapports aient eu un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le d\u00e9lai de traitement des demandes de PGP, ce qui est l\u2019essence m\u00eame de cette plainte. Cela dit, la transparence dans la communication des d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes de PGP est \u00e9videmment importante pour les candidats potentiels qui envisagent de pr\u00e9senter une demande et pour lesquels le temps d\u2019attente peut \u00eatre un facteur tr\u00e8s important dans leur d\u00e9cision. Toutefois, le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que cette diff\u00e9rence de traitement all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a eu un effet sur les d\u00e9lais d\u2019attente ou sur la demande du plaignant. De plus, cette all\u00e9gation n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Attaran, mais seulement dans son m\u00e9moire en r\u00e9ponse, ce qui a nui \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre. En cons\u00e9quence, cette all\u00e9gation de diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable est rejet\u00e9e.\nH. Un nombre disproportionn\u00e9 de PGP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 admis au Canada en tant que r\u00e9sidents permanents entre 2007 et 2019\n[347] M. Attaran n\u2019a pas formul\u00e9 d\u2019all\u00e9gations sp\u00e9cifiques concernant une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable pour ces motifs. Cet argument a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9 par la Commission. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une all\u00e9gation distincte concernant une politique ou une proc\u00e9dure particuli\u00e8re, mais plut\u00f4t d\u2019une observation sur les effets cumulatifs des pratiques discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9es et de l\u2019intentionnalit\u00e9 all\u00e9gu\u00e9e de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas non plus r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ces all\u00e9gations de marginalisation intentionnelle.\n[348] La Commission a compil\u00e9 des statistiques dans son m\u00e9moire (au paragraphe 86) pour montrer le faible nombre de PGP par rapport au nombre total d\u2019immigrants admis entre 2007 et 2019. Selon leurs calculs approximatifs, les PGP repr\u00e9sentaient 26 % de la cat\u00e9gorie familiale et seulement 6,79 % du nombre total d\u2019immigrants admis au cours de cette p\u00e9riode.\n[349] La Commission all\u00e8gue que la pression exerc\u00e9e pour accorder le plus d\u2019espace possible \u00e0 la classe \u00e9conomique peut contribuer \u00e0 expliquer la marginalisation du groupe des PGP. Elle se r\u00e9f\u00e8re \u00e0 la d\u00e9position de Glen Bornais, t\u00e9moin d\u2019IRCC, qui a parl\u00e9 de la tension qui existe parfois entre deux principes des objectifs de la LIPR : une \u00e9conomie canadienne prosp\u00e8re et la r\u00e9unification des familles. M. Bornais a parl\u00e9 des consultations continues avec les provinces et les territoires au cours de son mandat, de 2007 \u00e0 2018 environ. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait un consensus g\u00e9n\u00e9ral pour maintenir les niveaux d\u2019immigration stables, ou m\u00eame les augmenter, mais qu\u2019il y avait [Traduction] \u00ab une nette pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence pour, pour favoriser ou prioriser les programmes \u00e9conomiques \u00bb (enregistrement de l\u2019audience du 10 f\u00e9vrier 2021, interrogatoire direct de M. Bornais).\n[350] La Commission all\u00e8gue que la partie intim\u00e9e a intentionnellement marginalis\u00e9 les PGP en raison de ses outils agressifs de gestion du programme et de ses r\u00e8glements, dans le but d\u2019att\u00e9nuer d\u2019\u00e9ventuels effets \u00e9conomiques n\u00e9gatifs sur le pays. Elle cite l\u2019imposition d\u2019un revenu minimum n\u00e9cessaire pour les parrains et les longs engagements financiers que ces derniers sont tenus de signer. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les exigences impos\u00e9es aux parrains des PGP sont plus lourdes que celles impos\u00e9es aux parrains du groupe FC1, la Commission sugg\u00e8re que cela est bas\u00e9 sur une certaine perception qu\u2019a IRCC des parents et des grands-parents et [Traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9montre un souci de g\u00e9rer l\u2019effet du groupe sur le tr\u00e9sor public canadien \u00bb (paragraphe 95 du m\u00e9moire de la CCDP).\n[351] La Commission all\u00e8gue en outre la marginalisation du groupe PGP en limitant le parrainage \u00e0 ceux qui peuvent se le permettre :\n[Traduction]\nNotamment, cela sugg\u00e8re \u00e9galement que le regroupement familial, en ce qui concerne les parents et les grands-parents, peut \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux nouveaux Canadiens et aux Canadiens \u00e9tablis qui peuvent se le permettre. Cet aspect constitue un indice suppl\u00e9mentaire de la marginalisation de ce groupe. Ils doivent d\u00e9pendre de leurs r\u00e9pondants pendant une longue p\u00e9riode, manifestement en corr\u00e9lation avec leur esp\u00e9rance de vie, afin de minimiser leur fardeau sur l\u2019\u00e9conomie canadienne. (paragraphe 95 du m\u00e9moire de la CCDP)\n[352] Le fait que les PGP n\u2019aient repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 que 6,7 % du total des immigrants au cours de la p\u00e9riode 2007-2019 s\u2019explique par de nombreux facteurs. Les revenus plus \u00e9lev\u00e9s exig\u00e9s et les engagements plus longs peuvent avoir contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce r\u00e9sultat. Toutefois, ces facteurs sont trait\u00e9s s\u00e9par\u00e9ment ci-dessus et sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme r\u00e9sultant de la r\u00e9glementation, qui n\u2019est pas contest\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Le nombre inf\u00e9rieur de PGP dans l\u2019ensemble est le r\u00e9sultat direct des nombres constamment bas allou\u00e9s aux admissions de PGP dans les plans de niveaux, qui ne sont pas non plus remis en cause dans cette plainte.\n[353] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la baisse du nombre d\u2019admissions \u00e9tait due \u00e0 la pr\u00e9occupation du gouvernement concernant l\u2019effet financier n\u00e9gatif sur les ressources du Canada. Il est tout \u00e0 fait possible que le Cabinet ait eu l\u2019intention de limiter le nombre d\u2019immigrants PGP afin d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les r\u00e9percussions n\u00e9gatives sur les syst\u00e8mes de prestation de soins de sant\u00e9 et sur d\u2019autres ressources limit\u00e9es. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 ces d\u00e9cisions sont r\u00e9gies par le r\u00e9gime de la LIPR, le r\u00e8glement d\u2019application de la LIPR, les plans de niveaux et les instructions minist\u00e9rielles, elles d\u00e9passent le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente enqu\u00eate pour les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es.\n[354] Pour obtenir gain de cause, la Commission devrait d\u00e9montrer que les actions d\u2019IRCC, dans le cadre de son autorit\u00e9, ont exacerb\u00e9 le nombre inf\u00e9rieur d\u2019admissions de PGP. Les raisons susmentionn\u00e9es expliquent pourquoi la Commission n\u2019a pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 s\u2019acquitter de cette charge de la preuve. M\u00eame dans le cas des ann\u00e9es o\u00f9 IRCC n\u2019a pas atteint les fourchettes cibles pour les PGP, le Tribunal accepte le t\u00e9moignage de M. Cardinal selon lequel les \u00e9carts \u00e9taient le r\u00e9sultat de facteurs \u00e9chappant \u00e0 son contr\u00f4le, tels que les retards dans les bureaux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, le d\u00e9calage de l\u2019atterrissage et le gaspillage de visas.\n[355] Par cons\u00e9quent, je ne consid\u00e8re pas que le nombre globalement disproportionn\u00e9 d\u2019admissions dans la cat\u00e9gorie PGP refl\u00e8te une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable dans la prestation d\u2019un service par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\nXVI. CONCLUSION SUR LA PREUVE PRIMA FACIE [356] Comme indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, le plaignant a \u00e9tabli la premi\u00e8re partie du test de Moore, \u00e0 savoir qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sente des caract\u00e9ristiques interdites de discrimination en vertu de la LCDP.\n[357] \u00c0 ce stade de l\u2019analyse, je dois examiner si la deuxi\u00e8me partie du crit\u00e8re de l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore a \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9e : le plaignant doit d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il a subi un effet n\u00e9gatif en ce qui concerne un service qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 fourni par l\u2019intim\u00e9. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9chou\u00e9 et la preuve prima facie n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie.\n[358] Compte tenu des raisons susmentionn\u00e9es, il n\u2019y avait pas suffisamment de preuves pour me convaincre, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que les actions contest\u00e9es suivantes ont entra\u00een\u00e9 une diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable dans la fourniture d\u2019un service par l\u2019intim\u00e9 :\nA)Ne pas autoriser le traitement simplifi\u00e9 (soumission simultan\u00e9e des parties 1 et 2 des demandes) pour les demandeurs PGP;\nB)Le refus des examens m\u00e9dicaux pr\u00e9alables pour les demandeurs PGP;\nC)Permettre aux autres membres de la famille d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9s plus rapidement comme les conjoints et les enfants;\nD)L\u2019absence de normes de service en mati\u00e8re de traitement pour le sous-groupe PGP;\nE)La suspension des demandes de parrainage relatives aux PGP au CTD-Mississauga en 2004 et 2005;\nF)Le transfert des ressources vers les demandes FC1;\nG)La mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019intim\u00e9 indique les d\u00e9lais de traitement des demandes de PGP;\nH)La marginalisation intentionnelle pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des demandeurs PGP.\n[359] Le plaignant et la Commission ont \u00e9galement contest\u00e9 la mani\u00e8re dont IRCC a mis en \u0153uvre les plans de niveaux. J\u2019ai conclu ci-dessus que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement et l\u2019application des plans de niveaux ne constituent pas un service au sens de la LCDP et qu\u2019il n\u2019existe pas de pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire permettant \u00e0 IRCC d\u2019ignorer ou de contourner les plans de niveaux.\n[360] La s\u00e9rie suivante d\u2019actions contest\u00e9es se fonde sur les instructions minist\u00e9rielles. J\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que les instructions minist\u00e9rielles ne pouvaient pas \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme un service au sens de la LCDP.\n[361] L\u2019autre all\u00e9gation concerne le fait que le ministre n\u2019a pas exerc\u00e9 son autorit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 25.2(1) de la LIPR pour exempter les parrains et les demandeurs du sous-groupe PGP de tout r\u00e8glement de la LIPR qui pourrait \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9 comme discriminatoire pour un motif illicite en vertu de la LCDP. Cette all\u00e9gation \u00e9tait, par essence, une attaque contre les r\u00e8glements mis en cause. Le plaignant et la Commission ont la charge de la preuve et n\u2019ont pas \u00e9tabli que l\u2019\u00e9laboration de r\u00e8glements est un service, et ont sp\u00e9cifiquement sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal de ne pas trancher cette question.\n[362] La plainte est rejet\u00e9e parce que le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019ont pas r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie. Bien qu\u2019ils aient d\u00e9montr\u00e9 des diff\u00e9rences et des fa\u00e7ons dont les demandes de PGP ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9es plus lentement que les autres cat\u00e9gories, le plaignant et la Commission ne se sont pas acquitt\u00e9s de la charge qui leur incombait de d\u00e9montrer que l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tait livr\u00e9 \u00e0 une pratique discriminatoire. Pour chaque all\u00e9gation discut\u00e9e ci-dessus, soit aucune diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablie, soit la diff\u00e9rence de traitement d\u00e9favorable all\u00e9gu\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 expliqu\u00e9e par un \u00e9l\u00e9ment qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 prouv\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant un \u00ab service \u00bb en vertu de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP.\nXVII. D\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate A. D\u00e9cisions sur la confidentialit\u00e9\n[363] Une enqu\u00eate devant le TCDP est toujours men\u00e9e en public, \u00e0 quelques exceptions pr\u00e8s. En vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, une formation du TCDP peut rendre une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 si elle l\u2019estime n\u00e9cessaire pour un motif \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans cet article. Dans l\u2019affaire qui m\u2019occupe, j\u2019ai rendu des ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 pour deux s\u00e9ries d\u2019informations \u00e0 la demande des parties.\n[364] Le premier jour de l\u2019audience, M. Attaran a demand\u00e9 la confidentialit\u00e9 des informations personnelles contenues dans deux s\u00e9ries de documents admis comme pi\u00e8ces 2 et 3. Les pi\u00e8ces 2 et 3 sont les formulaires de demande et les documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui que M. Attaran et ses parents ont soumis \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour commencer la demande de parrainage de l\u2019immigration pour ses parents. Les pi\u00e8ces contiennent de nombreux renseignements personnels, notamment l\u2019avis de cotisation de l\u2019Agence du revenu du Canada du M. Attaran, une lettre de son employeur et des copies de documents d\u2019identit\u00e9. Bien que cette demande soit au c\u0153ur des faits de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, les renseignements contenus dans ces formulaires et les documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui qui font partie des pi\u00e8ces 2 et 3 n\u2019ont rien \u00e0 voir avec les questions dont le Tribunal est saisi. Il y a un risque substantiel que la divulgation de ces informations personnelles cause un pr\u00e9judice injustifi\u00e9 au plaignant et \u00e0 sa famille. Les termes utilis\u00e9s dans les formulaires eux-m\u00eames et certains termes passe-partout dans les lettres types de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont une certaine pertinence. En cons\u00e9quence, les informations contenues dans les formulaires et les documents \u00e0 l\u2019appui qui font partie des pi\u00e8ces 2 et 3 sont soumises \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi. Les r\u00e9ponses aux formulaires, les informations personnelles contenues dans les lettres et les documents d\u2019appui doivent \u00eatre caviard\u00e9es afin de pr\u00e9server la confidentialit\u00e9 des informations personnelles.\n[365] J\u2019ai \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux dates des \u00e9changes de correspondance dans la pi\u00e8ce 3, qui sont \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9es dans la pi\u00e8ce 82, l\u2019imprim\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me de gestion cas global de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour le dossier de M. Attaran. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que la pi\u00e8ce 82 contient \u00e9galement des informations personnelles de nature d\u00e9licate, j\u2019ordonne par la pr\u00e9sente que les informations personnelles de la pi\u00e8ce 82 soient caviard\u00e9es, mais pas les dates de correspondance qu\u2019elle contient.\n[366] La deuxi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie d\u2019informations pour lesquelles j\u2019ai accord\u00e9 la confidentialit\u00e9 concerne les informations m\u00e9dicales relatives \u00e0 M. Bornais, le t\u00e9moin de l\u2019intim\u00e9. Comme mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, M. Bornais n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de compl\u00e9ter son t\u00e9moignage devant le Tribunal pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales. J\u2019ai accept\u00e9 d\u2019accorder une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 pour les deux lettres m\u00e9dicales que le Tribunal a re\u00e7ues au sujet de son \u00e9tat. Une lettre d\u2019instructions, un enregistrement d\u2019une CTP et certaines parties de l\u2019enregistrement officiel de l\u2019audience ont \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 soumis \u00e0 cette ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)c) de la Loi.\n[367] La deuxi\u00e8me ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 est devenue litigieuse lorsque les parties ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leurs arguments finaux par \u00e9crit. Le plaignant a inclus dans son m\u00e9moire des citations r\u00e9elles des lettres confidentielles et a fait d\u2019autres r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 la nature de la maladie qui faisait l\u2019objet de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9. Cela a incit\u00e9 les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u2019\u00e9crire le 14 f\u00e9vrier 2022 pour clarifier ce qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9 confidentiel et pour prendre note de certaines parties des observations \u00e9crites du plaignant qui, selon lui, tombaient sous le coup de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9. Le plaignant a \u00e9galement mentionn\u00e9 une partie de l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019audience du matin du 30 avril 2021 qui devait faire l\u2019objet de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9.\n[368] Le 3 mars 2022, j\u2019ai adress\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019instructions aux parties afin de clarifier la port\u00e9e de mon ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 initiale. Bien qu\u2019elle ne soit pas aussi large que l\u2019affirment les avocats de l\u2019intim\u00e9, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que les paragraphes 203, 204 et 211 du m\u00e9moire du plaignant dat\u00e9 du 3 d\u00e9cembre 2021 devaient \u00eatre caviard\u00e9s. Les paragraphes 203 et 211 contenaient des citations textuelles (entre guillemets) des lettres dont j\u2019avais ordonn\u00e9 la confidentialit\u00e9. Le paragraphe 204 contenait cinq r\u00e9f\u00e9rences \u00e0 la nature de l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin qui faisait l\u2019objet de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 et, \u00e0 mon avis, contrevenait \u00e0 l\u2019esprit et \u00e0 l\u2019intention de l\u2019ordonnance.\n[369] En ce qui concerne une partie de l\u2019enregistrement audio du 30 avril 2021, M. Attaran a fait une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence verbale \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin au cours d\u2019un \u00e9change entre les avocats. Quelques minutes plus tard, M. Stynes a indiqu\u00e9 que la discussion s\u2019\u00e9tait aventur\u00e9e dans le domaine soumis \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 existante. M. Attaran a reconnu son erreur et s\u2019est excus\u00e9. Il a \u00e9galement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucune objection et qu\u2019il consentait \u00e0 ce que cette partie de l\u2019enregistrement audio soit retir\u00e9e du dossier public.\nB. La requ\u00eate de divulgation du privil\u00e8ge du cabinet et les diff\u00e9rends qui s\u2019ensuivent\n[370] M. Attaran a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande de divulgation de documents suppl\u00e9mentaires apr\u00e8s le neuvi\u00e8me jour de l\u2019audience. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019\u00e9tant oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 la divulgation en invoquant le secret professionnel, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 que les observations soient pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par \u00e9crit. Afin de pr\u00e9server la prochaine s\u00e9rie de dates d\u2019audience pr\u00e9vues, j\u2019ai rendu une br\u00e8ve d\u00e9cision provisoire sur la requ\u00eate dans une lettre aux parties dat\u00e9e du 26 mars 2021. La lettre indiquait que je donnerais des motifs plus complets dans la d\u00e9cision finale sur le fond, qui sont maintenant expos\u00e9s dans la pr\u00e9sente section.\n[371] Le deuxi\u00e8me t\u00e9moin de la partie intim\u00e9e, M. Bornais, avait travaill\u00e9 comme conseiller aupr\u00e8s de hauts fonctionnaires d\u2019IRCC. Son travail se situait \u00e0 un niveau tr\u00e8s \u00e9lev\u00e9 et \u00e9tait parfois li\u00e9 aux plans de niveaux d\u00e9cid\u00e9s par le Cabinet en vertu de l\u2019article 94 de la LIPR. Lors de son contre-interrogatoire par M. Attaran, le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bornais a port\u00e9 sur l\u2019existence de certains documents qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s auparavant par IRCC. Au cours du contre-interrogatoire, le conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a soulev\u00e9 plusieurs objections aux questions pos\u00e9es au t\u00e9moin par M. Attaran. La question du privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, autrement dit un document confidentiel du Conseil priv\u00e9 de la Reine pour le Canada, a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulev\u00e9e et M. Bornais a invoqu\u00e9 ce privil\u00e8ge pour expliquer sa r\u00e9ticence \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 certaines questions. (Comme mentionn\u00e9 ci-dessus, M. Bornais n\u2019a pas pu terminer son t\u00e9moignage pour des raisons m\u00e9dicales).\n[372] Comme M. Bornais a fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 certains documents qui n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s auparavant, M. Attaran a demand\u00e9 qu\u2019ils soient divulgu\u00e9s. Comme l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait invoqu\u00e9 le privil\u00e8ge en r\u00e9ponse, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas prudent de prendre une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate depuis l\u2019estrade. En cons\u00e9quence, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 aux parties de pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites sur la demande de divulgation des documents mentionn\u00e9s dans le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bornais. Comme l\u2019audience devait reprendre en avril 2021, j\u2019ai donn\u00e9 aux parties seulement quatre semaines pour pr\u00e9senter des observations \u00e9crites.\n[373] M. Attaran et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une requ\u00eate conjointe pour la divulgation. Les demandes ont d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9es par courrier \u00e9lectronique directement entre les parties. Cependant, la requ\u00eate \u00e9crite a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 les documents demand\u00e9s, de 2008 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui, comme suit :\n[Traduction]\nTous les m\u00e9morandums et documents d\u2019information destin\u00e9s au ministre (\u00e0 l\u2019exclusion de ceux envoy\u00e9s au cabinet pour l\u2019informer) et tous les documents de consultation FPT li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration des plans annuels de niveaux, et qui : (1) contiennent ou commentent les sc\u00e9narios pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par le minist\u00e8re, ou (2) font partie de la v\u00e9rification des signaux qui a eu lieu avec le cabinet du ministre. En outre, et en ce qui concerne l\u2019affirmation selon laquelle le plan des niveaux est une d\u00e9cision du Cabinet et non une d\u00e9cision minist\u00e9rielle discr\u00e9tionnaire, et : (3) tout d\u00e9cret contenant la d\u00e9cision sur le fond du Cabinet sur le plan des niveaux, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un document public et non d\u2019un document confidentiel du Cabinet.\n[374] La requ\u00eate soutenait que le t\u00e9moignage de M. Bornais r\u00e9v\u00e9lait qu\u2019avant que les plans de niveaux annuels ne soient \u00e9tablis par le Cabinet, IRCC effectuait un important travail pr\u00e9paratoire dans le cadre d\u2019un exercice continu d\u2019\u00e9valuation des compromis dans les priorit\u00e9s et de l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du personnel d\u2019IRCC et du ministre. Ce travail pr\u00e9paratoire comprend la cr\u00e9ation de m\u00e9morandums et de documents de consultation FPT (f\u00e9d\u00e9ral-provincial-territorial).\n[375] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de la pertinence de ces documents, la requ\u00eate souligne que plusieurs documents similaires ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s.\n[376] Les principaux arguments de l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e9taient que les documents n\u2019\u00e9taient pas pertinents et que, s\u2019ils l\u2019\u00e9taient, ils relevaient du secret professionnel. En ce qui concerne l\u2019argument de la pertinence, le conseil de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la question devant le Tribunal comme portant sur le temps de traitement r\u00e9el de la demande de parrainage de M. Attaran. L\u2019affaire ne porte pas, selon eux, sur la question de savoir si le temps de traitement aurait pu \u00eatre diff\u00e9rent si des plans de niveaux diff\u00e9rents avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis; les plans de niveaux \u00e9taient ce qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient au moment de la demande en 2009.\n[377] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a accus\u00e9 le plaignant et la Commission d\u2019avoir modifi\u00e9 leur argumentation au milieu de l\u2019audience pour all\u00e9guer que le plan des niveaux \u00e9tait le service offert. Selon eux, une question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale se posait, car ils estimaient que le plaignant et la Commission n\u2019avaient pas plaid\u00e9 leur cause en affirmant que les plans de niveaux \u00e9taient le service offert.\n[378] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement pr\u00e9venu que si le Tribunal concluait que les documents demand\u00e9s \u00e9taient pertinents, il serait contraint de d\u00e9poser une demande aupr\u00e8s du greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 39 de la Loi sur la preuve au Canada (LPC) afin de demander une attestation pour les documents consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme relevant du secret du Cabinet. Cette demande pourrait prendre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 six mois, ont-ils averti.\n[379] M. Attaran a soulign\u00e9 que l\u2019article 39 de la LPC permettait \u00e9galement \u00e0 un ministre de la Couronne d\u2019accorder la certification pour le privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, auquel cas cela pourrait prendre beaucoup moins de six mois. En r\u00e9ponse, M. Stynes a fait valoir qu\u2019il existait une [Traduction] \u00ab convention constitutionnelle \u00bb qui ne permettait pas \u00e0 un ministre d\u2019accorder une certification pour des documents prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par le secret du cabinet qui provenaient d\u2019un autre gouvernement. Dans ce cas, cela reviendrait \u00e0 demander \u00e0 un ministre du gouvernement lib\u00e9ral de prendre une d\u00e9cision sur des documents datant d\u2019une p\u00e9riode ant\u00e9rieure \u00e0 2015, qui \u00e9taient du ressort de l\u2019ancien gouvernement conservateur.\n[380] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que le bien-fond\u00e9 de la demande doit \u00eatre mis en balance avec le risque de retard, et a cit\u00e9 ma d\u00e9cision sur Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2017 TCDP 28 (Brickner) aux paragraphes 7 et 8 :\n[7] [...] dans la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, et malgr\u00e9 la pertinence probable des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, le Tribunal peut exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter une demande de divulgation, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les exigences de la justice naturelle et les R\u00e8gles sont respect\u00e9es, afin d\u2019assurer l\u2019instruction informelle et exp\u00e9ditive de la plainte (voir Gil c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet\u00e9 et de l\u2019Immigration), 1999 CanLII 8407 (CF), au paragraphe 13; voir \u00e9galement l\u2019article 48.9(1) de la Loi).\n[8] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 reconnu dans ses d\u00e9cisions ant\u00e9rieures qu\u2019il peut refuser d\u2019ordonner la divulgation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lorsque la valeur probante de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne l\u2019emporte pas sur leur effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur l\u2019instance. Le Tribunal doit notamment faire preuve de prudence avant d\u2019ordonner une perquisition lorsque cela obligerait une partie ou une personne \u00e9trang\u00e8re au litige \u00e0 se soumettre \u00e0 une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation, surtout lorsque le fait d\u2019ordonner la divulgation risquerait d\u2019entra\u00eener un retard important dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte ou lorsque les documents ne se rapportent qu\u2019\u00e0 une question secondaire plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux principales questions en litige (voir Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22, au paragraphe 4; Seeley, au paragraphe 7; voir aussi R. c. Seaboyer [1991] 2 R.C.S. 577, aux pages 609 \u00e0 611). [soulign\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9].\n[381] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019audience ne devait pas reprendre avant plusieurs semaines, j\u2019ai estim\u00e9 que l\u2019ordonnance de divulgation ne retarderait pas ind\u00fbment la fin de l\u2019audience et, au fil des \u00e9v\u00e9nements, cela s\u2019est av\u00e9r\u00e9 exact.\n[382] Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement \u00e9tabli qu\u2019aux fins de l\u2019analyse de la pertinence d\u00e9fendable des documents, la plainte, la th\u00e9orie de l\u2019affaire contenue dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de chaque partie et l\u2019ensemble de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de chaque partie servent tous de guides. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada:\nAux fins de divulgation, la plainte, la th\u00e9orie de la cause incluse dans l'expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions ainsi que l\u2019ensemble de ce dernier servent de guides afin d\u2019identifier la pertinence potentielle des documents. Cette pertinence potentielle sera analys\u00e9e autant du point de vue de la partie plaignante que de celui de la partie intim\u00e9e ou de celui repr\u00e9sentant l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public en l\u2019occurrence, la Commission. Autrement dit, les documents \u00e0 divulguer ne sont pas seulement ceux qui appuient la position d\u2019une seule partie, mais bien de toutes les parties. [Soulignement ajout\u00e9 par l\u2019avocat] Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Radio-Canada, 2017 TCDP 5, au para. 36.\n[383] En examinant les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties, j\u2019ai conclu qu\u2019il existait un lien suffisant avec les plans de niveaux. La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9, en particulier, ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des arguments relatifs aux plans de niveaux et \u00e0 leur r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9termination du nombre d\u2019admissions de PGP et des priorit\u00e9s appliqu\u00e9es. J\u2019ai donc conclu que les documents demand\u00e9s dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate \u00e9taient \u00e0 tout le moins vraisemblablement pertinents.\n[384] Le paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit que toutes les parties comparaissant devant le Tribunal doivent avoir \u00ab la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre et de pr\u00e9senter, en personne ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ainsi que leurs observations \u00bb. Les anciennes R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure pour les instances ant\u00e9rieures au 11 juillet 2021 du Tribunal qui s\u2019appliquaient \u00e0 cette affaire (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb), stipulent des obligations de divulgation documentaire visant \u00e0 s\u2019assurer que les parties se voient accorder cette possibilit\u00e9.\n[385] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)d) et le paragraphe 6(4) des R\u00e8gles exigent des parties qu\u2019elles d\u00e9posent une liste des documents non privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s qui se rapportent \u00e0 des faits, des questions ou des formes de r\u00e9paration d\u00e9termin\u00e9s par les parties \u00e0 l\u2019affaire, et qu\u2019elles divulguent des copies de tous ces documents aux autres parties. L\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles exige des parties qu\u2019elles fournissent une liste de tous les documents pour lesquels un privil\u00e8ge est revendiqu\u00e9. (Toutefois, les parties ne sont pas tenues de divulguer des copies de ces documents privil\u00e9gi\u00e9s). La d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate stipule \u00e9galement que l\u2019obligation de divulgation des parties est permanente. Le paragraphe 6(5) des R\u00e8gles stipule qu\u2019une partie doit fournir des informations suppl\u00e9mentaires soit lorsque de nouveaux faits, questions ou recours sont identifi\u00e9s, soit lorsque la partie d\u00e9couvre que ses obligations de divulgation sont inexactes ou incompl\u00e8tes.\n[386] Avant de rendre ma d\u00e9cision du 26 mars 2021, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a estim\u00e9 que le nombre de documents d\u00e9coulant de la requ\u00eate de la partie plaignante pourrait \u00eatre compris entre 50 et 100. Certains d\u2019entre eux pourraient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement conform\u00e9ment aux R\u00e8gles. Toutefois, mon ordonnance stipulait que si l\u2019un des documents \u00e9tait revendiqu\u00e9 comme \u00e9tant soumis au privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, il \u00e9tait ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e9num\u00e9rer ces documents conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 6(1)e) des R\u00e8gles et de pr\u00e9ciser sur cette liste les raisons pour lesquelles le paragraphe 39(4) de la LPC ne s\u2019appliquait pas \u00e0 ces documents. J\u2019ai en outre ordonn\u00e9 que, pour les documents pr\u00e9tendument soumis au secret professionnel, l\u2019intim\u00e9 obtienne un certificat d\u2019un ministre de la Couronne ou du greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 39 de la LPC. J\u2019ai donn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai jusqu\u2019au 30 avril 2021, mais j\u2019ai \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 que j\u2019examinerais une demande de prolongation, si n\u00e9cessaire. (J\u2019ai par la suite accord\u00e9 une prolongation jusqu\u2019au 30 juillet 2021).\n[387] Un certain nombre de documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 la suite de ma d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate et n\u2019ont pas fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une revendication de privil\u00e8ge. Toutefois, le plaignant n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait et a insist\u00e9 pour attendre une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9 concernant la d\u00e9termination du reste des documents. J\u2019esp\u00e9rais que l\u2019intim\u00e9 demanderait une d\u00e9cision au ministre responsable, car cela aurait pu prendre moins de temps que de demander une certification au greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9 a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que la [Traduction] \u00ab convention constitutionnelle \u00bb emp\u00eachait cette approche, bien qu\u2019il y ait tr\u00e8s peu de preuves de l\u2019existence d\u2019une telle convention. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 ma demande de pr\u00e9ciser dans sa liste de documents les raisons pour lesquelles le paragraphe 39(4) de la LPC, qui \u00e9num\u00e8re les exceptions au privil\u00e8ge du Cabinet, ne s\u2019appliquait pas.\n[388] N\u00e9anmoins, lorsque l\u2019audience a repris \u00e0 la fin du mois d\u2019avril 2021, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 une nouvelle prolongation de d\u00e9lai pour recevoir la certification du greffier du Conseil priv\u00e9. J\u2019ai accord\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de prolongation et la certification du greffier int\u00e9rimaire, qui excluait 31 documents de la divulgation, a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e le 14 juillet 2021.\n[389] La certification du greffier int\u00e9rimaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 transmise aux autres parties et l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fourni des copies partiellement caviard\u00e9es de certains documents ainsi qu\u2019une liste d\u2019autres documents susceptibles de faire l\u2019objet de r\u00e9clamations en vertu de l\u2019article 38 de la LPC et un avis concernant un autre document prot\u00e9g\u00e9 en vertu de l\u2019article 37 de la LPC.\n[390] L\u2019ordonnance de divulgation a suscit\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9 quant au fait que les dispositions relatives \u00e0 la notification avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clench\u00e9es en vertu du paragraphe38.01(1) de la LPC. Le 5 novembre 2021, le Groupe de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du minist\u00e8re de la Justice a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande ex parte aupr\u00e8s de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale concernant certains documents qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment. Le 9 novembre 2021, le juge Kane a ordonn\u00e9 que M. Attaran soit d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme d\u00e9fendeur\/intim\u00e9 dans la demande et que l\u2019affaire, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en vertu du paragraphe 38.04(2) de la LPC, soit rendue publique.\n[391] Lorsque M. Attaran a re\u00e7u l\u2019avis de demande modifi\u00e9 dat\u00e9 du 9 novembre 2021, il en a transmis une copie au Tribunal et l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne serait plus en mesure de respecter le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 pour la pr\u00e9sentation des arguments finaux.\n[392] Lors d\u2019une CTP ult\u00e9rieure, M. Stynes a indiqu\u00e9 que la demande concernait des documents qui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9s le 16 septembre 2021. Deux de ces divulgations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es comme pi\u00e8ces 191 et 192 au cours de l\u2019audience. Les parties caviard\u00e9es de ces documents portaient sur des questions qui n\u2019\u00e9taient pas importantes pour les questions soumises au Tribunal.\n[393] N\u00e9anmoins, le recours devant la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 une distraction inopportune pour les parties et les d\u00e9lais pour les plaidoiries finales \u00e9crites ont d\u00fb \u00eatre \u00e0 nouveau retard\u00e9s.\n[394] M. Attaran a ensuite d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande en vue d\u2019obtenir les d\u00e9pens dans cette affaire, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e par le juge Kane le 16 mars 2022 (voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Attaran 2022 FC 353).\nSign\u00e9 par\nDavid L.

ADDENDUM \u2013 L\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 [395] Toute all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur est une affaire tr\u00e8s s\u00e9rieuse. Malheureusement, cette all\u00e9gation a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite au cours de l\u2019audience. Cette d\u00e9cision sur le fond serait incompl\u00e8te si je n\u2019abordais pas l\u2019incident et si je ne donnais pas les raisons pour lesquelles j\u2019ai poursuivi l\u2019enqu\u00eate apr\u00e8s que l\u2019all\u00e9gation a \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9e. L\u2019all\u00e9gation n\u2019a en rien affect\u00e9 mon analyse dans cette d\u00e9cision sur le fond.\n[396] Pour donner bri\u00e8vement le contexte, lorsque l\u2019audience a repris le 29 avril 2021, elle a commenc\u00e9 par ma d\u00e9cision sur l\u2019admission du t\u00e9moin expert de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le professeur Michael Haan, et de son rapport d\u2019expertise. Comme il est indiqu\u00e9 ci-dessus, cette d\u00e9cision faisait suite \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de deux jours de contre-interrogatoire du professeur Haan sur son expertise et \u00e0 un apr\u00e8s-midi entier d\u2019argumentation sur la question de savoir si je devais ou non l\u2019accepter en tant qu\u2019expert.\n[397] Il m\u2019a sembl\u00e9 que M. Attaran n\u2019\u00e9tait pas satisfait de ma d\u00e9cision. Au cours de l\u2019interrogatoire direct de M. Stynes sur le rapport d\u2019expertise du professeur Haan, le docteur Attaran a formul\u00e9 deux objections lorsqu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des ensembles de donn\u00e9es concernant les co\u00fbts de la sant\u00e9. M. Attaran a object\u00e9 que le professeur Haan n\u2019\u00e9tait pas qualifi\u00e9 en tant qu\u2019expert en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9. Lorsque j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 la deuxi\u00e8me objection, M. Attaran a fait la premi\u00e8re de plusieurs insinuations selon lesquelles j\u2019accordais un traitement pr\u00e9f\u00e9rentiel au t\u00e9moin parce qu\u2019il partageait les m\u00eames caract\u00e9ristiques que moi en termes de sexe et de race. M. Attaran a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab Il doit y avoir une limite, pr\u00e9sident... Il y a une propension \u00e0 penser que tout professeur qui est un homme blanc est un expert en tout \u00bb (enregistrement de l\u2019audience \u00e0 02:49 le 29 avril 2021).\n[398] Le lendemain matin, M. Attaran a fait une insinuation similaire. Il m\u2019a accus\u00e9 d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 incoh\u00e9rent dans une d\u00e9cision relativement \u00e0 l\u2019interrogatoire de son t\u00e9moin expert. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [Traduction] \u00ab La premi\u00e8re fois que cela s\u2019est produit, le professeur \u00e9tait asiatique et de sexe f\u00e9minin, et cette fois-ci, le professeur est blanc et de sexe masculin. Je vais laisser cela dans le dossier \u00bb (enregistrement de l\u2019audience \u00e0 02:10 le 30 avril 2021). Au cours de ces deux jours, j\u2019ai compt\u00e9 plusieurs occasions o\u00f9 M. Attaran a insinu\u00e9 que je traitais le professeur Haan avec une certaine pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence parce que, comme le t\u00e9moin, je suis \u00e9galement blanc et de sexe masculin.\n[399] Dans une audience administrative comme celle-ci, l\u2019arbitre a diff\u00e9rents r\u00f4les \u00e0 jouer. Tout d\u2019abord, il doit \u00eatre impartial et ne doit pas \u00eatre en conflit d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eats avec les parties, que ce conflit soit r\u00e9el ou per\u00e7u. L\u2019arbitre si\u00e8ge \u00e0 l\u2019audience pour recevoir des informations, des t\u00e9moignages et des arguments juridiques. Les parties ont le droit de tester les preuves de l\u2019autre afin de s\u2019assurer que l\u2019arbitre dispose des meilleures informations pour fonder sa d\u00e9cision.\n[400] Cette audience n\u2019a ressembl\u00e9 \u00e0 aucune autre que j\u2019ai jug\u00e9e auparavant en termes de nombre d\u2019objections et de requ\u00eates sur lesquelles j\u2019ai d\u00fb me prononcer. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement \u00e9t\u00e9 contraint, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, de demander aux parties de respecter le d\u00e9corum et de s\u2019abstenir de faire des commentaires mesquins et de s\u2019insulter mutuellement. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement demand\u00e9 aux parties de s\u2019abstenir de sugg\u00e9rer que d\u2019autres ne respectent pas leurs obligations en vertu du Code de d\u00e9ontologie du Barreau de l\u2019Ontario. J\u2019ai d\u00fb rendre toutes sortes de d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate au cours de cette enqu\u00eate. Je soup\u00e7onne toutes les parties d\u2019avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 parfois m\u00e9contentes de certaines de mes d\u00e9cisions.\n[401] M. Attaran a formul\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 apr\u00e8s le retour d\u2019une pause de 20 minutes pendant son contre-interrogatoire du professeur Haan. Avant la pause, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9, M. Stynes, avait soulev\u00e9 une objection aux questions pos\u00e9es \u00e0 son t\u00e9moin. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que M. Attaran tentait d\u2019intimider son t\u00e9moin en s\u2019en prenant \u00e0 son int\u00e9grit\u00e9 acad\u00e9mique. M. Attaran a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 poser des questions au t\u00e9moin sur ses possibles violations de l\u2019\u00e9thique et ses fautes professionnelles.\n[402] L\u2019\u00e9change concernant l\u2019interrogation sur les violations de l\u2019\u00e9thique et les fautes professionnelles a \u00e9t\u00e9 houleux, ce qui m\u2019a finalement amen\u00e9 \u00e0 demander une pause de 20 minutes. Le professeur Haan avait \u00e9t\u00e9 exclu de la salle d\u2019audience apr\u00e8s l\u2019objection de M. Stynes pendant que les avocats discutaient de la ligne d\u2019interrogation. J\u2019ai dit au M. Attaran que je ne voulais pas que les t\u00e9moins soient malmen\u00e9s, menac\u00e9s ou intimid\u00e9s. J\u2019ai r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019en tant qu\u2019arbitre, [Traduction] \u00ab j\u2019essaie de maintenir un certain d\u00e9corum ici, et je vous demande donc de coop\u00e9rer \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, et juste dans les mani\u00e8res, et il y a de petites choses, M. Attaran, que vous dites et que vous faites, et les expressions que vous faites, mais elles sont intimidantes pour les gens. Et je ne pense pas qu\u2019il soit n\u00e9cessaire pour nous, afin de passer \u00e0 travers les preuves qui permettront \u00e0 ce Tribunal de prendre une d\u00e9cision sur les questions qui sont devant lui \u00bb.\n[403] R\u00e9trospectivement, ce ne sont pas les meilleurs mots que j\u2019aurais pu choisir. J\u2019essayais d\u2019\u00e9viter les propos incendiaires, mais je pensais que toutes les parties et les membres de la tribune avaient bien compris ce que je voulais dire lorsque j\u2019ai fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux \u00ab mani\u00e8res \u00bb et aux choses que M. Attaran a faites au cours de l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai utilis\u00e9 le mot \u00ab mani\u00e8res \u00bb, mais il aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 plus juste de parler des \u00ab gestes th\u00e9\u00e2traux \u00bb que M. Attaran a faits pendant que d\u2019autres parlaient, comme rouler la t\u00eate en arri\u00e8re, se moquer et se jeter le visage dans les mains.\n[404] N\u00e9anmoins, M. Attaran a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 critiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ses \u00ab mani\u00e8res \u00bb par un arbitre et a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que ce que je venais de dire avait quelque chose \u00e0 voir avec le fait qu\u2019il faisait partie d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible. M. Attaran a ensuite de nouveau laiss\u00e9 entendre que j\u2019avais des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux et que mon comportement \u00e9tait sexiste. Mon commentaire n\u2019avait rien \u00e0 voir avec l\u2019appartenance ethnique de M. Attaran. C\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que j\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait temps de faire une pause de 20 minutes.\n[405] J\u2019avais d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de remettre de l\u2019ordre dans la salle d\u2019audience et d\u2019accorder au M. Attaran la plus grande latitude possible pour poser les questions qu\u2019il souhaitait pour le reste de son contre-interrogatoire. Cependant, avant que je ne dise quoi que ce soit \u00e0 notre retour, M. Attaran a fait une d\u00e9claration sur sa perception de ma partialit\u00e9 :\n[Traduction]\nMais je pense que la mani\u00e8re dont vous m\u2019avez critiqu\u00e9, pour ma fa\u00e7on de parler ou mes mani\u00e8res, en disant que je n\u2019en \u00e9tais peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame pas conscient, est irrespectueuse. Je ne pense pas que vous auriez d\u00fb faire cela. Et je pense honn\u00eatement que cela donne lieu \u00e0 une appr\u00e9hension relative \u00e0 des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients. J\u2019ai pass\u00e9 toute ma vie professionnelle, en tant que membre d\u2019une minorit\u00e9, \u00e0 me faire dire que je devais parler diff\u00e9remment, que je devais me comporter diff\u00e9remment, ce n\u2019est pas quelque chose que j\u2019appr\u00e9cie. Je suis malheureux que cela se soit produit ici et de la part d\u2019une personne que je respecte, tout comme vous. La jurisprudence m\u2019oblige \u00e0 faire \u00e9tat d\u2019une crainte de partialit\u00e9 dans le proc\u00e8s-verbal lorsqu\u2019elle se produit. Je le fais donc sans acrimonie (enregistrement de l\u2019audience \u00e0 02:12 le 30 avril 2021).\n[406] J\u2019ai imm\u00e9diatement demand\u00e9 au M. Attaran s\u2019il me demandait de me r\u00e9cuser. Il m\u2019a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il me demandait de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la question de savoir si je devais ou si j\u2019aurais d\u00fb faire la d\u00e9claration qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite.\n[407] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 surpris par cette all\u00e9gation et a demand\u00e9 si M. Attaran avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation. M. Attaran a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une telle requ\u00eate et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab heureux de proc\u00e9der \u00bb au contre-interrogatoire du professeur Haan.\n[408] L\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 une longue suspension de s\u00e9ance pour effectuer des recherches sur la question, ce que j\u2019ai accord\u00e9. M. Attaran s\u2019est entretenu avec l\u2019avocat de la Commission. J\u2019ai pens\u00e9 qu\u2019au cours de la pause, les parties pourraient absorber l\u2019ampleur de ce qui venait de se passer.\n[409] Au retour de la suspension d\u2019audience, l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 la jurisprudence concernant la gravit\u00e9 d\u2019une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur, en particulier au milieu de l\u2019audience. Il a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que M. Attaran pr\u00e9sente une requ\u00eate en r\u00e9cusation ou retire compl\u00e8tement son all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 avant que l\u2019audience ne se poursuive.\n[410] M. Attaran a r\u00e9primand\u00e9 M. Stynes pour avoir sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019on lui indique ce qu\u2019il devrait faire. M. Attaran m\u2019a ensuite reproch\u00e9 mon commentaire sur ses mani\u00e8res et sa fa\u00e7on de parler. Il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 que cela lui semblait \u00eatre le r\u00e9sultat de mes pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux inconscients. M. Attaran a dit que je regrettais probablement de l\u2019avoir dit et a laiss\u00e9 entendre que je voulais probablement m\u2019excuser de l\u2019avoir dit. C\u2019\u00e9tait la cinqui\u00e8me fois que M. Attaran insinuait ou d\u00e9clarait que j\u2019avais des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux \u00e0 son encontre.\n[411] M. Attaran et la Commission ont tous deux d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient pr\u00eats \u00e0 poursuivre l\u2019audience ce jour-l\u00e0. M. Attaran souhaitait mettre de c\u00f4t\u00e9 son all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 et poursuivre son contre-interrogatoire du professeur Haan. L\u2019audience devait \u00e9galement se poursuivre la semaine suivante avec la d\u00e9position d\u2019un autre t\u00e9moin.\n[412] Une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un d\u00e9cideur, en particulier au milieu d\u2019une audience, est une question qui doit \u00eatre trait\u00e9e. J\u2019ai d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que j\u2019aurais besoin de plus de temps pour r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir et examiner la jurisprudence avant de prendre une d\u00e9cision. J\u2019ai donc mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019audience ce jour-l\u00e0 et nous avons lib\u00e9r\u00e9 les jours d\u2019audience pour la semaine suivante.\n[413] Avant de d\u00e9crire la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019affaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9solue, je ressens le besoin de m\u2019exprimer d\u2019un point de vue personnel. Les all\u00e9gations de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s raciaux sont tr\u00e8s toxiques dans le monde d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui. La simple all\u00e9gation d\u2019une telle irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9 entra\u00eene une stigmatisation importante et il est souvent tr\u00e8s difficile pour l\u2019accus\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir la r\u00e9demption, car l\u2019all\u00e9gation, bien que difficile \u00e0 prouver, est \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 r\u00e9futer. Ma r\u00e9putation personnelle a \u00e9t\u00e9 mise en cause par l\u2019all\u00e9gation de M. Attaran, et je souhaite donc r\u00e9pondre pour me d\u00e9fendre. Tout d\u2019abord, je n\u2019observe pas que M. Attaran parle avec un accent ou diff\u00e9remment de quiconque en Am\u00e9rique du Nord. Il est n\u00e9 et a grandi en Californie et a fait ses \u00e9tudes et travaill\u00e9 dans certaines des universit\u00e9s les plus prestigieuses du monde anglophone. Je n\u2019ai jamais rencontr\u00e9 M. Attaran en personne. Je ne l\u2019ai vu que sur un \u00e9cran vid\u00e9o. Il ne m\u2019appara\u00eet m\u00eame pas comme une minorit\u00e9 visible. La situation pourrait peut-\u00eatre \u00eatre diff\u00e9rente en personne. Je doute aussi fortement d\u2019avoir un pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 inconscient \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des personnes d\u2019origine ethnique persane. Certains de mes amis les plus proches sont originaires d\u2019Iran, notamment mon camarade de chambre \u00e0 l\u2019universit\u00e9, qui est rest\u00e9 un ami de toujours et qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 mon mariage en tant que gar\u00e7on d\u2019honneur. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une demande de r\u00e9cusation, je n\u2019ai pas consid\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation comme s\u00e9rieuse. Je l\u2019ai plut\u00f4t per\u00e7ue comme une tentative d\u2019intimidation, ce qui n\u2019a pas eu le r\u00e9sultat escompt\u00e9.\n[414] Au moment d\u2019un litige, il est possible que les esprits s\u2019\u00e9chauffent et que le jugement soit alt\u00e9r\u00e9. Dans le cadre d\u2019une audience d\u2019un tribunal des droits de la personne, les all\u00e9gations de discrimination sont toujours pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, ce qui peut peut-\u00eatre influencer les perceptions.\n[415] Le Tribunal est sensible au fait que M. Attaran se repr\u00e9sentait lui-m\u00eame et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des objections en temps opportun pour pr\u00e9server ses droits lorsqu\u2019il estimait qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9s. Toutefois, il convient d\u2019\u00e9tablir une distinction entre, d\u2019une part, le fait de s\u2019opposer \u00e0 une ligne de conduite adopt\u00e9e \u2013 ou m\u00eame \u00e0 une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate \u2013 par le Tribunal et, d\u2019autre part, le fait de mettre en cause l\u2019impartialit\u00e9 et l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du Tribunal. Cette derni\u00e8re ne doit pas \u00eatre invoqu\u00e9e en dehors d\u2019une demande de r\u00e9cusation.\n[416] Il est bien \u00e9tabli que dans certains contextes, une partie doit pr\u00e9senter une objection opportune sur une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 afin d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019affirmation d\u2019une renonciation. Toutefois, la renonciation ne peut s\u2019appliquer dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 est li\u00e9e \u00e0 ce qui est dit ou fait au cours du processus d\u00e9cisionnel (Rothesay Residents Association Inc. c. Rothesay Heritage Preservation & Review Board et al, 2006 NBCA 61 (CanLII), au paragraphe 14).\n[417] La partialit\u00e9 est une question s\u00e9rieuse. Dans l\u2019affaire Arthur c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2001 FCA 223, au paragraphe 8, la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019encontre d\u2019un tribunal est une all\u00e9gation s\u00e9rieuse qui ne peut \u00eatre faite \u00e0 la l\u00e9g\u00e8re. Lorsqu\u2019elles sont utilis\u00e9es pendant l\u2019audience comme un simple outil de plaidoyer, les all\u00e9gations de partialit\u00e9 minent l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re respectueuse qui est n\u00e9cessaire au fonctionnement du processus quasi judiciaire. Elles enflamment la proc\u00e9dure et d\u00e9tournent l\u2019attention des questions \u00e0 trancher. Parce qu\u2019elles ne visent pas \u00e0 obtenir une d\u00e9cision sur la r\u00e9cusation du membre, de telles all\u00e9gations \u00e9rodent la confiance dans l\u2019administration de la justice puisqu\u2019elles n\u2019offrent aucun moyen de les corroborer ou de les rejeter.\n[418] M. Stynes a d\u00e9crit l\u2019all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 de M. Attaran sans requ\u00eate de r\u00e9cusation comme une \u00ab \u00e9p\u00e9e de Damocl\u00e8s \u00bb suspendue au-dessus de la proc\u00e9dure. Selon M. Stynes, \u00e0 moins d\u2019\u00eatre enti\u00e8rement retir\u00e9e, une all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 servirait de \u00ab carte ma\u00eetresse \u00bb au M. Attaran pour jouer en faveur d\u2019une r\u00e9vision judiciaire si la d\u00e9cision sur le fond n\u2019\u00e9tayait pas sa plainte (enregistrement de l\u2019audience \u00e0 020:34 le 30 avril 2021).\n[419] Le probl\u00e8me inh\u00e9rent \u00e0 toute all\u00e9gation de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9 inconscient est qu\u2019il est pratiquement impossible de prouver ce qui se passe dans l\u2019esprit d\u2019une autre personne, en particulier lorsque l\u2019argument est que la personne n\u2019en est m\u00eame pas consciente. Les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients trouvent leur origine dans le test des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s implicites mis au point par un groupe de chercheurs am\u00e9ricains en psychologie sociale il y a une trentaine d\u2019ann\u00e9es. Bien que ce test ait \u00e9t\u00e9 largement utilis\u00e9 pour la formation sur le lieu de travail, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 controvers\u00e9 au sein de la communaut\u00e9 scientifique en raison de son incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la norme accept\u00e9e de r\u00e9sultats de test coh\u00e9rents, sugg\u00e9rant pour beaucoup que les implications, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les r\u00e9sultats du test peuvent \u00eatre li\u00e9s \u00e0 une propension \u00e0 la discrimination, ne sont pas justifiables. Une simple all\u00e9gation de partialit\u00e9 inconsciente faite devant un membre du Tribunal doit \u00eatre accueillie avec prudence et mesure. Si le plaignant peut faire valoir que l\u2019intim\u00e9 est discriminatoire en raison de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients invisibles, l\u2019intim\u00e9 est tout aussi susceptible de faire valoir que le plaignant est dans l\u2019illusion et qu\u2019il voit de la discrimination l\u00e0 o\u00f9 elle n\u2019existe pas. Aucun de ces arguments n\u2019est utile \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre.\n[420] L\u2019audience ayant \u00e9t\u00e9 suspendue pour une dur\u00e9e ind\u00e9termin\u00e9e, j\u2019ai pris le temps de r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019affaire pouvait se poursuivre. Toutes les parties avaient investi des ann\u00e9es de pr\u00e9paration dans cette enqu\u00eate et nous avions d\u00e9j\u00e0 termin\u00e9 14 jours d\u2019audience. Ce serait un \u00e9norme revers si un nouvel arbitre devait \u00eatre nomm\u00e9 pour reprendre l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[421] Apr\u00e8s r\u00e9flexion, j\u2019ai adress\u00e9 aux parties une lettre concernant le d\u00e9corum le 20 mai 2021, qui d\u00e9crivait mes attentes concernant le d\u00e9corum de l\u2019audience et le bon ordre n\u00e9cessaire pour mener \u00e0 bien l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Les parties ont fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 ces directives sous le nom de \u00ab Directives sur le d\u00e9corum \u00bb pour le reste de l\u2019audience. Plusieurs all\u00e9gations ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faites selon lesquelles les parties ne respectaient pas les directives sur le d\u00e9corum \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019audience en septembre. Toutefois, je n\u2019ai consid\u00e9r\u00e9 aucune violation comme \u00e9tant suffisamment pr\u00e9judiciable pour justifier une nouvelle suspension de la proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait all\u00e9e si loin et approchait de la fin. Elle devait arriver \u00e0 sa conclusion.",

Aper\u00e7u [1] La plaignante (\u00ab GH \u00bb) all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (le \u00ab SCRS \u00bb) a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard en fournissant une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable et infond\u00e9e \u00e0 un employeur \u00e9ventuel, au titre de l\u2019article 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb). Les commentaires n\u00e9gatifs auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9s apr\u00e8s que GH et le SCRS se soient entendus sur le r\u00e8glement d\u2019une plainte que GH avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle travaillait pour le SCRS.\n[2] Le SCRS d\u00e9ment avoir pos\u00e9 un quelconque acte discriminatoire et, plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, nie avoir fourni une r\u00e9f\u00e9rence d\u00e9favorable ou des commentaires n\u00e9gatifs sur GH \u00e0 quiconque travaillant chez l\u2019employeur \u00e9ventuel.\n[3] Le SCRS a, au titre de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 pour emp\u00eacher la divulgation publique de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ses employ\u00e9s, anciens ou actuels, puisqu\u2019une telle divulgation mettrait ces derniers en p\u00e9ril et minerait \u00e0 la fois leur capacit\u00e9 et celle du SCRS \u00e0 faire enqu\u00eate sur des menaces envers la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada. GH et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) ont consenti \u00e0 l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e par le SCRS.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je suis convaincu qu\u2019il est raisonnable, n\u00e9cessaire et dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de rendre une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 selon les conditions propos\u00e9es \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la divulgation publique des renseignements confidentiels poserait un risque s\u00e9rieux pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique et qu\u2019il existe une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats.

Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 35, le membre du Tribunal Paul Singh a repris les termes de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP ainsi que de l\u2019analyse \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada Sherman (Succession) c Donovan [Sherman (Succession)] que le Tribunal doit r\u00e9aliser en regard de la loi pour rendre une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 52. La Cour a \u00e9tabli un crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets auquel il faut satisfaire pour obtenir gain de cause au moment de solliciter une exception au principe de la publicit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. Il doit \u00eatre \u00e9tabli ce qui suit :\n1) la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important; 2) l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter ce risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence, car d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque; 3) du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\nIII. Analyse [6] Au cours de la pr\u00e9sente instance, les parties ont l\u2019intention de citer des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, dont GH, qui \u00e9taient ou sont toujours des employ\u00e9s du SCRS et elles ont l\u2019intention de divulguer des renseignements, y compris dans les actes de proc\u00e9dure et dans la preuve documentaire, qui permettent d\u2019identifier des employ\u00e9s, anciens et actuels, de cette organisation.\n[7] La divulgation de ces renseignements par le truchement du dossier public du Tribunal contreviendrait \u00e0 l\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (la \u00ab Loi sur le SCRS \u00bb). L\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur le SCRS interdit de communiquer l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un employ\u00e9, ancien ou actuel, qui a particip\u00e9, participe ou pourrait vraisemblablement participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es du SCRS ou des informations qui permettraient de d\u00e9couvrir son identit\u00e9.\n[8] Divulguer publiquement l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019employ\u00e9s du SCRS, anciens ou actuels, met ces derniers en p\u00e9ril et mine \u00e0 la fois leur capacit\u00e9 et celle de l\u2019organisation \u00e0 faire enqu\u00eate sur des menaces envers la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du Canada. Cette divulgation peut poser un risque s\u00e9rieux pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique comme l\u2019envisage l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)a) de la LCDP. Elle soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats, comme le pr\u00e9voit l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)d). Par cons\u00e9quent, une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[9] L\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 telle qu\u2019elle est sollicit\u00e9e par le SCRS est l\u2019option qui permet le mieux de concilier l\u2019objectif consistant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les renseignements confidentiels contre la divulgation et les int\u00e9r\u00eats du Canada en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public quant \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. Il n\u2019existe pas d\u2019autres modalit\u00e9s raisonnables qui permettraient d\u2019atteindre les m\u00eames objectifs. Les conditions de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019auront aucun effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur GH dans la pr\u00e9sente instance. De surcro\u00eet, elle y a consenti, tout comme la Commission.\n[10] Les conditions de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 sont donc conformes \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP et respectent le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 trois volets \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession). Par cons\u00e9quent, la requ\u00eate est accueillie et l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 est rendue aux conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-apr\u00e8s.\nIV. Ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 [11] Tout renseignement permettant d\u2019identifier la plaignante ou tout employ\u00e9 du SCRS, ancien ou actuel (un \u00ab employ\u00e9 du SCRS \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 confidentielle \u00bb), est d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme renseignement confidentiel au titre de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP.\n[12] La plaignante sera d\u00e9sign\u00e9e seulement sous le pseudonyme \u00ab GH \u00bb dans tous les documents et les actes de proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au Tribunal, ainsi que dans toute la correspondance entre les parties et le Tribunal, et dans toutes les d\u00e9cisions et les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 nouvel ordre.\n[13] Les parties auront 30 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal pour red\u00e9poser leurs documents et leurs actes de proc\u00e9dure sous des versions qui utilisent le pseudonyme \u00ab GH \u00bb. Ces nouveaux documents remplaceront les versions ant\u00e9rieures.\n[14] Toute copie papier d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par les parties qui comporte des renseignements confidentiels doit \u00eatre plac\u00e9e dans une enveloppe scell\u00e9e portant la mention \u00ab confidentiel \u00bb et ne doit pas \u00eatre vers\u00e9e au dossier public du Tribunal, dans la mesure o\u00f9 une version du document o\u00f9 les renseignements confidentiels sont expurg\u00e9s ou retir\u00e9s est vers\u00e9e au dossier public.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 doit toujours d\u00e9signer tout employ\u00e9 du SCRS \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 confidentielle dans les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal par les m\u00eames initiales al\u00e9atoires ou par un autre pseudonyme et doit indiquer le titre du poste.\n[16] Les parties auront 30 jours \u00e0 compter de la date de l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal pour red\u00e9poser leurs documents et leurs actes de proc\u00e9dure sous une forme qui fait usage de pseudonymes, au besoin. Ces nouveaux documents remplaceront les versions ant\u00e9rieures.\n[17] \u00c0 la demande d\u2019une partie ou de la Commission, le nom complet de l\u2019employ\u00e9 du SCRS \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 confidentielle doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9, lorsque le titre du poste et les autres renseignements fournis ne permettent pas de l\u2019identifier ni de cerner sa participation sur un point litigieux. Elles doivent garder ces renseignements confidentiels et ne peuvent pas les rendre publics ni les inclure dans les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal.\n[18] Toutes les parties sont tenues de respecter la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements confidentiels en \u00e9vitant d\u2019y renvoyer publiquement ou dans toute instance publique. Elles doivent seulement d\u00e9signer les employ\u00e9s du SCRS \u00e0 l\u2019identit\u00e9 confidentielle par les initiales al\u00e9atoires ou autres pseudonymes qui leur ont \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9e par\nEdward P.

Ordonnance 20\nI. Contexte de la demande [1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) tranchant une requ\u00eate de la plaignante et de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) visant \u00e0 ce que des mesures soient mises en place afin de s\u2019assurer de la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[2] Sans entrer dans tous les d\u00e9tails, la plaignante demande, en raison de la violence conjugale exerc\u00e9e par un ancien partenaire contre elle et les risques pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle de ses enfants, que son nom ainsi que ses autres informations d\u2019identification personnelle soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n[3] Quant \u00e0 la Commission, elle pr\u00e9sente plusieurs ordonnances pr\u00e9cises au Tribunal et qui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9es de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\nUne interdiction de publication;\nL\u2019anonymisation du nom de la plaignante, des t\u00e9moins, des lieux g\u00e9ographiques et des informations d\u2019identification personnelle; La mise sous scell\u00e9 du dossier du Tribunal; Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de nouveaux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions anonymis\u00e9s; L\u2019interdiction de divulgation\/distribution des enregistrements; La r\u00e9tention de comp\u00e9tence du Tribunal sur la question de la confidentialit\u00e9.\n[4] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes (la \u00ab Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb ou l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9e \u00bb) s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Elle plaide que la requ\u00eate est pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle serait fond\u00e9e sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du dossier. Elle estime aussi que le risque invoqu\u00e9 est sp\u00e9culatif.\n[5] De plus, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 plaide que, si le Tribunal accordait la requ\u00eate, les mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 demand\u00e9es par la plaignante et la Commission seraient trop larges et devraient \u00eatre consid\u00e9rablement limit\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019anonymisation de l\u2019adresse de la plaignante et de sa situation g\u00e9ographique actuelle, entre autres.\nII. Question en litige [6] Existe-t-il des circonstances particuli\u00e8res permettant au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner des mesures afin d\u2019assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction en raison :\n-d\u2019un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit de la plaignante \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable, de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher la divulgation de renseignements l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a le public \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique?\n-d\u2019un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres, de sorte que la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019emp\u00eacher leur divulgation dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique?\n-d\u2019une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de ses enfants puisse \u00eatre mise en danger par la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats?\nIII. D\u00e9cision [7] Pour les raisons suivantes, le Tribunal accorde de la requ\u00eate, en partie.\nIV. Analyse [8] La r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale veut que les proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, dont celle du Tribunal, soient soumises au principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats. L\u2019article 52 de la LCDP est clair et se r\u00e9sume essentiellement \u00e0 ceci : les proc\u00e9dures du Tribunal sont publiques.\n[9] N\u00e9anmoins, la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats n\u2019est pas un principe absolu et il peut exister des cas pr\u00e9cis permettant de prendre des mesures afin d\u2019assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires lorsque les circonstances l\u2019exigent.\n[10] \u00c0 ce titre, la jurisprudence du Tribunal est constante. Afin de pouvoir ordonner de telles mesures, il doit exister des motifs les justifiant, et ce, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP (voir par exemple Woodgate et al. c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 20 (CanLII); A.B. et Gracie c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2022 TCDP 15 (CanLII)).\n[11] Le paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit ces exceptions et \u00e9tablit les crit\u00e8res \u00e0 respecter permettant au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner des mesures de confidentialit\u00e9. Ils peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de la mani\u00e8re suivante, soit :\n-Il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique [alin\u00e9a a)];\n-Il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction [alin\u00e9a b)];\n-Il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions personnelles ou autres et leur protection l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique [alin\u00e9a c)];\n-Il existe une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la vie, la libert\u00e9 ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne soit mise en danger [alin\u00e9a d)].\n[12] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession) c. Donovan, 2021 CSC 25 (CanLII), au paragraphe 38, la Cour supr\u00eame a clarifi\u00e9 l\u2019analyse en trois crit\u00e8res \u00e0 respecter afin de limiter la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire :\n1) La publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important;\n2) L\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter ce risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence, car d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque; et\n3) Du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n[13] Le Tribunal a r\u00e9cemment confirm\u00e9 que l\u2019analyse modifi\u00e9e de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada appuie d\u00e9j\u00e0 les crit\u00e8res traditionnels \u00e9tablis par le paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP (SM, SV et JR c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 35 (CanLII), au par. 8). Il faut donc en comprendre que l\u2019analyse pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP n\u2019est pas en contradiction avec la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada.\n[14] Enfin, le Tribunal a \u00e9galement \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans White c. Laboratoires Nucl\u00e9aires Canadiens Lt\u00e9e, 2020 TCDP 37 [White] que l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP exige une analyse qui balance l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 un d\u00e9bat judiciaire public et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat personnel de la partie qui demande la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction en tout ou en partie (White, au par. 54). Autrement dit, il existe un fardeau \u00e0 satisfaire afin qu\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 soit accord\u00e9e.\n[15] Comme le pr\u00e9voit le paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP, le membre doit \u00eatre convaincu qu\u2019une ordonnance est n\u00e9cessaire pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure. Quant \u00e0 Sherman, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada nous rappelle qu\u2019il faut \u00eatre convaincu que la mesure de confidentialit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter le risque s\u00e9rieux en question, et qu\u2019aucune autre mesure raisonnable \u2013 autrement dit, aucune autre mesure moins restrictive \u2013 ne peut \u00eatre prise afin d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque.\n[16] Enfin, l\u2019analyse de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP et de l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman permet d\u2019\u00e9carter d\u2019embl\u00e9e les cas o\u00f9 les ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 seraient demand\u00e9es par une partie parce que c\u2019est utile ou pratique ou parce qu\u2019elle estime que la publication des informations serait source d\u2019inconv\u00e9nients et d\u2019embarras. L\u2019analyse \u00e9carte \u00e9galement les situations o\u00f9 les parties consentiraient toutes \u00e0 la demande ou les situations o\u00f9 il y aurait absence d\u2019opposition \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9, sans toutefois que les crit\u00e8res de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP et de l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman soient respect\u00e9s (White, au par. 50).\n[17] En raison de ce qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8de, le Tribunal estime que la requ\u00eate de la plaignante et de la Commission est conforme aux alin\u00e9as 52(1)b), c) et d) de la LCDP et \u00e0 l\u2019analyse pr\u00e9vue dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman, avec quelques adaptations n\u00e9cessaires quant aux mesures \u00e0 prendre afin de pond\u00e9rer le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires et les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la plaignante relativement \u00e0 sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle de ses enfants. Le Tribunal abordera de front quelques arguments de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et expliquera pourquoi il n\u2019y souscrit pas.\n[18] La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 estime que la requ\u00eate de la plaignante et de la Commission est fond\u00e9e sur la pr\u00e9somption que la plaignante devra t\u00e9moigner sur les all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale dont elle a fait l\u2019objet. Selon elle, la plaignante n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli la pertinence des informations relatives \u00e0 la violence conjugale qu\u2019elle aurait subie.\n[19] Les parties se sont express\u00e9ment entendues afin que les motifs de distinction illicite du sexe et du statut familial soient ajout\u00e9s \u00e0 la plainte. L\u2019objectif de cet ajout \u00e9tait de permettre \u00e0 la plaignante de plaider que la violence genr\u00e9e, dont la violence conjugale, est une forme de discrimination. \u00c0 cet effet, elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 le 16 d\u00e9cembre 2021, avec l\u2019accord des parties et du Tribunal, dans lequel elle expose sa position \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard, au paragraphe 21.\n[20] Il est fort surprenant d\u2019entendre la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 plaider maintenant que ni la plaignante ni la Commission n\u2019ont \u00e9tabli la pertinence des all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que plaide la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, les all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale sont actuellement pr\u00e9sentes dans la plainte et sont pertinentes. La plaignante plaide notamment que lorsqu\u2019elle a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00e0 son employeur, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait victime de violence conjugale, elle a subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable par ce dernier durant son emploi et son contrat de travail n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9.\n[21] Le Tribunal ne comprend pas non plus l\u2019argument de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 selon lequel la question de la pertinence des all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale doit \u00eatre d\u00e9cid\u00e9e avant la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 et, que de ce fait, la demande serait pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 complexifie la proc\u00e9dure inutilement, alors que la plainte, comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, concerne notamment la violence conjugale subie par la plaignante, les effets de celle-ci sur son emploi et le traitement d\u00e9favorable qu\u2019elle aurait subi apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation de cette information \u00e0 son employeur.\n[22] Il est clair, depuis le d\u00e9but de ce dossier, que la violence conjugale est un enjeu dans la plainte et son instruction. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le Tribunal de traiter de la pertinence de ces all\u00e9gations de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire puisque le tout figure d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la plaignante. De ce fait, le Tribunal devra in\u00e9vitablement entendre de la preuve sur la violence conjugale subie par la plaignante.\n[23] Dans la m\u00eame veine, un autre argument de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 est que la plaignante et la Commission n\u2019ont pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019introduire en preuve les all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci de la proc\u00e9dure. Autrement dit, la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 serait bas\u00e9e sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 admis en preuve, qui n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis ou prouv\u00e9s. Le Tribunal reste perplexe \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un tel argument.\n[24] D\u2019abord, comme le Tribunal l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, les all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale sont incluses dans la plainte. Maintenant, le Tribunal devra entendre ce qui est ultimement n\u00e9cessaire relativement aux all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale, ce qui n\u2019ouvre pas la porte au d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui ne sont pas pertinents ni n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la plainte. Il existe des limites, comme le plaide la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. La plaignante et la Commission pourront alors se concentrer sur les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de la violence conjugale qui sont n\u00e9cessaires relativement \u00e0 la plainte et il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le Tribunal de recevoir tous les d\u00e9tails de la violence qu\u2019aurait subie la plaignante.\n[25] Cela dit, la plaignante n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat et le Tribunal est un tribunal administratif, qui doit n\u00e9cessairement faire preuve de souplesse (paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP). Le Tribunal lui donnera la flexibilit\u00e9 n\u00e9cessaire pour qu\u2019elle t\u00e9moigne sur son exp\u00e9rience et qu\u2019elle puisse raconter son histoire et ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu alors qu\u2019elle travaillait pour la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. In\u00e9vitablement, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019elle parlera de son exp\u00e9rience de violence conjugale. Maintenant, cette situation n\u2019enl\u00e8vera pas l\u2019occasion \u00e0 la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de contre-interroger la plaignante, de plaider dans ses arguments finaux du poids ou de la pertinence \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la plaignante, tout comme cela ne lui enl\u00e8ve pas l\u2019occasion de plaider que la violence conjugale n\u2019est pas couverte par la LCDP contrairement \u00e0 l\u2019argument de la plaignante et de la Commission.\n[26] Ensuite, selon la connaissance du Tribunal, les requ\u00eates qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es avant l\u2019administration de la preuve qui, elle, se fait \u00e0 l\u2019audience, se fondent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui n\u2019ont pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 test\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, ce qui tombe naturellement sous le sens. C\u2019est pourquoi une partie qui d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate d\u00e9posera \u00e9galement certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments afin de l\u2019appuyer, par exemple le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un affidavit. C\u2019est exactement ce que la plaignante a fait. Dans cet affidavit, qui a par ailleurs \u00e9t\u00e9 fait sous serment en bonne et due forme, la plaignante explique \u00eatre une survivante de violence conjugale inflig\u00e9e par un ancien partenaire et a fourni beaucoup de d\u00e9tails sur ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu et les effets de cette violence sur elle et ses enfants.\n[27] Afin de rassurer la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas, \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci, \u00e0 \u00e9valuer la preuve au dossier. L\u2019administration de la preuve se fera \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal n\u2019en est pas non plus \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la violence conjugale devrait \u00eatre couverte par la LCDP. Le Tribunal entendra \u00e9galement les parties \u00e0 ce sujet \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Toutefois, l\u2019objectif de cette d\u00e9cision vise uniquement \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si des mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 devraient \u00eatre accord\u00e9es pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de ses enfants.\n[28] \u00c0 ce stade-ci, le Tribunal d\u00e9tient un affidavit produit par la plaignante au soutien de sa demande et de celle de la Commission. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de contre-interroger la plaignante sur cet affidavit, ce qu\u2019elle aurait pu faire. Ainsi, le Tribunal peut donner foi aux faits fournis par la plaignante dans son affidavit et peut les consid\u00e9rer comme vraies, aux fins de la requ\u00eate. Toutefois, ces all\u00e9gations ne constituent pas des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour l\u2019audience. Si la plaignante d\u00e9cide de pr\u00e9senter les \u00e9l\u00e9ments contenus dans son affidavit \u00e0 l\u2019audience, elle devra les prouver et le Tribunal \u00e9valuera la preuve en temps opportun. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, quant \u00e0 elle, aura l\u2019occasion de les contester, par exemple, en contre-interrogatoire de la plaignante ou en plaidant sur le poids ou la pertinence \u00e0 accorder \u00e0 la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e.\n[29] De m\u00eame, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas non plus en accord avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, qui soutient que les all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale de la plaignante, ses craintes et les actions qu\u2019elle a d\u00fb poser afin de se prot\u00e9ger et prot\u00e9ger ses enfants sont sp\u00e9culatives. Les m\u00eames raisons \u00e9nonc\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment s\u2019imposent dans les circonstances. La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9 par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9. En cons\u00e9quence, les faits qui y sont inclus peuvent \u00eatre tenus pour vrais par le Tribunal, aux fins de la requ\u00eate. Cet affidavit de la plaignante est clair et cat\u00e9gorique quant aux risques s\u00e9rieux existants et \u00e0 l\u2019absence de mesures raisonnables permettant d\u2019\u00e9carter ces risques (par. 52(1) de la LCDP et arr\u00eat Sherman, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9).\n[30] Dans son affidavit, la plaignante explique \u00eatre une survivante de violence conjugale inflig\u00e9e par un ancien partenaire et a produit des d\u00e9tails sur ce qu\u2019elle a v\u00e9cu. Elle affirme avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de violence physique et verbale et de menaces en personne, par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, par message texte et sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Son ancien partenaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 arr\u00eat\u00e9 et accus\u00e9 de plusieurs crimes en lien avec de la violence conjugale, accusations que la plaignante a retir\u00e9es par la suite en raison de la pression v\u00e9cue. Elle confirme qu\u2019il a, cependant, d\u2019autres ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents judiciaires li\u00e9s \u00e0 de la violence conjugale contre d\u2019autres femmes.\n[31] La plaignante ajoute que son ancien partenaire lui a confi\u00e9 qu\u2019il tuerait toute femme qui le d\u00e9noncerait \u00e0 la police et qu\u2019il est toujours recherch\u00e9 par la police pour de la violence inflig\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre femme.\n[32] La plaignante confirme avoir d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es en raison de ses craintes pour sa vie et sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Elle a \u00e9galement confi\u00e9 la garde de ses enfants \u00e0 une autre personne afin de les prot\u00e9ger. Elle ajoute qu\u2019elle ne croit pas que, \u00e0 ce jour, son ancien partenaire conna\u00eet l\u2019endroit o\u00f9 elle demeure actuellement et qu\u2019il n\u2019a aucune connaissance de ses coordonn\u00e9es, dont son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, son adresse courriel ou ses r\u00e9seaux sociaux. La plaignante ne conna\u00eet pas les all\u00e9es et venues de son ancien partenaire. Elle tente, dans la mesure du possible, de ne pas attirer son attention ou de l\u2019emp\u00eacher de la retrouver.\n[33] La plaignante plaide avoir subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable en cours d\u2019emploi de la part de son ancien employeur, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, lorsqu\u2019elle lui a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 \u00eatre victime de violence conjugale. Son contrat de travail n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 renouvel\u00e9. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle t\u00e9moignera \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur la violence conjugale qu\u2019elle a subie et ses effets sur elle, son bien-\u00eatre, son rendement au travail et ses interactions avec son ancien employeur \u00e0 la fin de son emploi.\n[34] Elle craint donc le fait que l\u2019instruction du Tribunal est publique, ce qui comprend, par exemple, les d\u00e9cisions futures du Tribunal qui contiendraient son nom, les avis publics d\u2019audience sur son site Internet, et le fait que cela peut attirer l\u2019attention de son ancien partenaire, des amis ou de la famille de celui-ci. Elle craint \u00e9galement que son dossier attire l\u2019attention des m\u00e9dias, qui pourraient publier son nom et ses autres informations personnelles.\n[35] La plaignante est \u00e9galement au courant que des organisations ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 au Tribunal des demandes pour assister \u00e0 titre de personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019instruction, en raison des all\u00e9gations relatives \u00e0 la violence conjugale. Elle craint que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de ces organisations attire l\u2019attention du public et des m\u00e9dias sur son dossier.\n[36] Elle croit que si son ancien partenaire apprend l\u2019existence de sa proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal, il pourrait faire une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information concernant le dossier officiel afin d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s aux documents dans son dossier. Elle croit \u00e9galement qu\u2019il reconna\u00eetra sa voix sur les enregistrements du Tribunal s\u2019il demandait \u00e0 y avoir acc\u00e8s.\n[37] Elle craint pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle de ses enfants si son ancien partenaire prend connaissance de ses all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale. Elle redoute aussi que, si ses informations personnelles ne sont pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, il soit en mesure de la retrouver elle ou ses enfants, dans le but de leur faire du mal ou de lui extorquer de l\u2019argent.\n[38] La plaignante a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle veut \u00e9galement t\u00e9moigner de la relation d\u2019amiti\u00e9 qu\u2019elle a eue avec une personne proche de son ancien partenaire et qui a essay\u00e9 de la prot\u00e9ger. Elle affirme que son ancien partenaire n\u2019est pas au courant de cette amiti\u00e9 entre elle et cette personne et que s\u2019il apprend l\u2019existence de cette relation, il s\u2019en prendra n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 elle.\n[39] Enfin, elle croit que si ses informations personnelles ne sont pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, elle ne se sentira pas suffisamment en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pour t\u00e9moigner librement et franchement devant le Tribunal. Elle craint que son ancien partenaire, s\u2019il apprenait l\u2019existence de cette proc\u00e9dure, puisse avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 de l\u2019information qui lui permettrait de la retrouver elle ou ses enfants. La seule solution qu\u2019elle entrevoit, si ses informations ne sont pas prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, sera de se relocaliser apr\u00e8s l\u2019audience du Tribunal, ce qui entra\u00eenera notamment des cons\u00e9quences sur sa vie, ses finances et ses acc\u00e8s avec ses enfants.\n[40] Le Tribunal est sensible aux informations qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies par la plaignante et il d\u00e9tient suffisamment d\u2019informations justifiant la mise en place de protections afin d\u2019assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de ses enfants au titre des alin\u00e9as 52(1)b), c) et d) de la LCDP. Le cas de la plaignante est un bon exemple des raisons pour lesquelles l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP existe.\n[41] Le Tribunal reconna\u00eet que la violence conjugale est un fl\u00e9au auquel le syst\u00e8me de justice doit porter une attention particuli\u00e8re. Les cours et tribunaux ont n\u00e9cessairement un r\u00f4le \u00e0 jouer afin de s\u2019assurer que les victimes de violence conjugale puissent se sentir en s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans le cadre des proc\u00e9dures judiciaires auxquelles elles participent. M\u00eame si le risque z\u00e9ro n\u2019existe pas, il faut tenter de limiter autant que possible de mettre ou de remettre en danger la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des victimes de violence conjugale lorsqu\u2019elles doivent partager de l\u2019information sur leur agresseur et la violence v\u00e9cue.\n[42] Selon les all\u00e9gations fournies par la plaignante, ce qui inclut des menaces de mort, il est clair que les avantages de prot\u00e9ger la plaignante et ses enfants l\u2019emportent sur les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9bat soit public.\n[43] Lorsque le Tribunal doit analyser le risque s\u00e9rieux au titre du paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP, ce risque doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9 \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re de ce qui pourrait se produire. Autrement dit, lorsque le Tribunal soup\u00e8se l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9bat judiciaire soit public, il doit aussi le faire au regard du risque s\u00e9rieux existant si des mesures de confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9taient pas ordonn\u00e9es et si ce risque devait r\u00e9ellement se concr\u00e9tiser.\n[44] Dans ce cas-ci, il n\u2019est pas question de simples craintes de la plaignante d\u2019\u00eatre embarrass\u00e9e si ses informations se retrouvaient dans la sph\u00e8re publique. Sous serment, la plaignante nous expose les risques s\u00e9rieux pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle de ses enfants, tant sur les plans psychologique, \u00e9motif et financier que sur le plan physique. La plaignante a subi de la violence de la part de son ancien partenaire, a \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de menaces, a d\u00fb se cacher, changer d\u2019adresse de r\u00e9sidence \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, se r\u00e9fugier dans des refuges pour femmes en raison de cette violence et des agissements de son ancien partenaire. Il l\u2019a cherch\u00e9e, l\u2019a retrouv\u00e9e et l\u2019a menac\u00e9e par t\u00e9l\u00e9phone, par message texte ou sur les r\u00e9seaux sociaux.\n[45] La plaignante a tent\u00e9, et tente encore \u00e0 ce jour, d\u2019\u00e9chapper \u00e0 l\u2019emprise de son ancien partenaire et d\u2019\u00e9viter d\u2019attirer son attention. Le Tribunal est inquiet lorsque la plaignante affirme que son agresseur lui a \u00e9galement confi\u00e9 qu\u2019il tuerait toute femme qui le d\u00e9noncerait. Les mots sont forts, inqui\u00e9tants et il est impossible de les ignorer.\n[46] La plaignante craint fondamentalement pour sa vie si son ancien partenaire devait \u00eatre mis au courant de ses proc\u00e9dures devant le Tribunal, s\u2019il apprenait qu\u2019elle allait raconter ce qu\u2019elle a subi sous son joug. Elle craint pour sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle de ses enfants et affirme que sa participation \u00e0 l\u2019audience serait consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duite si ses informations n\u2019\u00e9taient pas raisonnablement prot\u00e9g\u00e9es.\n[47] C\u2019est au regard de ces risques que le Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer la demande et il ne lui en faut pas plus afin de conclure que des ordonnances visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante sont n\u00e9cessaires en application des alin\u00e9as 52(1)b), c) et d) de la LCDP, et ce, en vue d\u2019assurer sa protection, sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et celle de ses enfants. Ce que la plaignante affirme n\u2019est pas anodin et il n\u2019y a aucune chance \u00e0 prendre lorsqu\u2019il est question de la vie de quelqu\u2019un, de sa s\u00e9curit\u00e9, et surtout lorsque la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019enfants est en jeu.\n[48] Enfin, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des copies de certains r\u00e9seaux sociaux de la plaignante dans lesquels son nom complet et son emplacement actuel appara\u00eetraient. La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 plaide que des photos d\u2019elle et de ses enfants se trouvent dans les r\u00e9seaux sociaux de la plaignante, et qu\u2019il existe des mani\u00e8res de la contacter et de lui envoyer des messages.\n[49] Le Tribunal comprend que la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 plaide que le fait que les informations de la plaignante se trouvent d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la sph\u00e8re publique et qu\u2019elles sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 accessibles par le public s\u00e8ment des doutes quant \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un risque r\u00e9el et s\u00e9rieux au sens du paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP (voir par exemple A.B. et Gracie c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2022 TCDP 15, au par. 39).\n[50] \u00c0 ce sujet, la Commission a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que la plaignante lui a confirm\u00e9 que les informations contenues dans ses r\u00e9seaux sociaux ne sont plus \u00e0 jour. Une simple lecture des copies des r\u00e9seaux sociaux de la plaignante d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 montre que les informations de la plaignante datent de plusieurs ann\u00e9es alors que nous sommes en 2023. Selon la Commission, la plaignante a aussi confirm\u00e9 ne plus demeurer \u00e0 l\u2019emplacement mentionn\u00e9 dans ses r\u00e9seaux sociaux. Comme les r\u00e9seaux sociaux de la plaignante datent de plusieurs ann\u00e9es, sans qu\u2019il soit possible d\u2019\u00e9tablir que les informations aient \u00e9t\u00e9 mises \u00e0 jour, et que la plaignante a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne demeure pas aux endroits mentionn\u00e9s dans ses r\u00e9seaux sociaux, le poids \u00e0 accorder aux arguments de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce sujet se retrouve consid\u00e9rablement r\u00e9duit. De plus, le Tribunal constate qu\u2019il n\u2019y a aucune r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans ses r\u00e9seaux sociaux quant \u00e0 son emplacement de travail chez la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\n[51] De plus, le Tribunal est en accord avec l\u2019argument de la Commission selon lequel l\u2019objectif d\u2019une ordonnance en confidentialit\u00e9 n\u2019est pas d\u2019effacer toute existence de la plaignante dans la sph\u00e8re publique. Il ne revient pas au Tribunal de le faire et celui-ci n\u2019a aucun contr\u00f4le sur ce qui existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 dans la sph\u00e8re publique. Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal est de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence (Sherman) si la divulgation d\u2019informations se produisait dans le cadre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure. Autrement dit, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si la divulgation des informations de la plaignante dans sa propre proc\u00e9dure pose un risque s\u00e9rieux au titre du paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP, ce \u00e0 quoi le Tribunal r\u00e9pond par l\u2019affirmative dans les circonstances.\n[52] En effet, dans le cas en question, le risque s\u00e9rieux existe notamment dans les liens que peut faire l\u2019ancien partenaire de la plaignante entre cette derni\u00e8re et ses informations personnelles qui se trouveraient dans la sph\u00e8re publique en raison de la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. L\u2019objectif des ordonnances de confidentialit\u00e9 vise notamment \u00e0 \u00e9viter que l\u2019ancien partenaire puisse croiser suffisamment de donn\u00e9es pour lui permettre de retrouver la plaignante ou ses enfants ou de susciter chez lui un d\u00e9sir ou une intention de tenter de la retrouver.\n[53] Enfin, la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 a aussi plaid\u00e9 que les mesures demand\u00e9es par la Commission et la plaignante sont trop larges et devraient se limiter notamment \u00e0 l\u2019adresse de la plaignante ou \u00e0 sa situation g\u00e9ographique. Le Tribunal pense qu\u2019il est effectivement possible d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9bat soit public, tout en prot\u00e9geant suffisamment la plaignante et ses enfants, notamment au regard du risque s\u00e9rieux existant.\n[54] Le Tribunal rappelle que dans ce cas-ci, le risque s\u00e9rieux se rapporte \u00e0 la violence psychologique, \u00e9motive et financi\u00e8re possible, mais aussi \u00e0 la violence physique, dont des menaces de mort qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es par l\u2019ancien partenaire envers les femmes qui le d\u00e9nonceraient. Compte tenu du risque s\u00e9rieux existant et de l\u2019absence d\u2019autres mesures permettant de diminuer ce risque, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019il doit mettre en place des ordonnances afin de prot\u00e9ger la plaignante et ses enfants, avec quelques adaptations, afin de trouver un \u00e9quilibre avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9bat judiciaire soit public.\n(i) Anonymisation des proc\u00e9dures et protection des informations personnelles, pass\u00e9es et futures\n[55] La premi\u00e8re mesure qui prot\u00e9gera consid\u00e9rablement la plaignante est son anonymisation dans toute la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. L\u2019anonymisation de la plaignante r\u00e9duira consid\u00e9rablement le risque que son ancien partenaire puisse faire un lien entre elle et la proc\u00e9dure devant le Tribunal. De ce fait, l\u2019anonymisation de la proc\u00e9dure permet d\u2019atteindre en grande partie la protection qui est recherch\u00e9e et diminuera consid\u00e9rablement le risque s\u00e9rieux existant.\n[56] Ainsi, aux fins de cette proc\u00e9dure, la plaignante sera nomm\u00e9e par les lettres K. L. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans les circonstances. Les parties devront d\u00e9poser de nouveaux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, dans lesquels ils auront retir\u00e9 toutes les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences au nom de la plaignante et les auront remplac\u00e9es par les lettres K. L. Les anciens expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions seront retir\u00e9s du dossier du Tribunal et les nouvelles versions les remplaceront.\n[57] La demande de la Commission voulant que l\u2019enti\u00e8ret\u00e9 du dossier du Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour soit scell\u00e9e est faite parce que c\u2019est utile ou pratique, et non par n\u00e9cessit\u00e9. Rien ne justifie une telle limitation au sens du paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP ni au sens de l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman. Si une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier officiel du Tribunal est faite par un membre du public ou un m\u00e9dia, toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pass\u00e9e ou future quant au nom de la plaignante sera remplac\u00e9e par K. L., dans tous les documents demand\u00e9s, ce qui inclut les correspondances, les instructions, les sommaires des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance, ou autres.\n[58] De plus, le Tribunal estime que toutes les informations personnelles relatives \u00e0 K. L. doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, ce qui comprend l\u2019adresse courriel, l\u2019adresse de r\u00e9sidence, le num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et autres informations d\u2019identification personnelle. Ainsi, pour tous les documents qui seront d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le dossier du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, les parties devront s\u2019assurer de caviarder toutes les informations d\u2019identification de la plaignante, dont son adresse courriel, son adresse de r\u00e9sidence et son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone. Si ces informations devaient avoir une incidence sur la preuve, les parties et le Tribunal exploreront d\u2019autres solutions, par exemple d\u00e9poser des copies non caviard\u00e9es des documents en question, mais qui pourront alors \u00eatre scell\u00e9es.\n[59] De plus, si une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier officiel du Tribunal est faite par un membre du public ou un m\u00e9dia, toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pass\u00e9e ou future quant \u00e0 ces informations sera \u00e9galement prot\u00e9g\u00e9e.\n[60] Compte tenu de l\u2019affidavit d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par la plaignante, des observations des parties et des pi\u00e8ces qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jointes, le Tribunal ordonne que les observations des parties et les documents d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au soutien de cette requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 soient scell\u00e9s en vertu du paragraphe 52(2) de la LCDP.\n[61] Toute d\u00e9cision future du Tribunal, toute correspondance, tout courriel et tout sommaire des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance nommeront la plaignante par les lettres K.L., ce qui inclut les d\u00e9cisions relatives aux demandes d\u2019interventions de tierces personnes.\n[62] Les correspondances futures des parties, les requ\u00eates ou les autres documents envoy\u00e9s au Tribunal ne doivent pas inclure le nom de la plaignante. Le nom de la plaignante et ses informations d\u2019identification personnelle devront \u00e9galement avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s dans les documents qui seront d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aux fins de l\u2019audience.\n[63] Conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Politique sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux dossiers officiels du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, les enregistrements des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance ne font pas partie du dossier officiel du Tribunal et ne sont pas accessibles \u00e0 tous. Le Tribunal ordonne tout de m\u00eame l\u2019interdiction de distribution de ces enregistrements puisque le nom de la plaignante, les t\u00e9moins, les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques, etc., y ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9s. Si les parties ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 demand\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces enregistrements des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences, le Tribunal leur interdit de les distribuer \u00e0 quiconque.\n(ii) Noms des t\u00e9moins\n[64] Le Tribunal a consult\u00e9 la liste de t\u00e9moins de la plaignante et il reconna\u00eet que certains t\u00e9moins pourraient effectivement poser certains probl\u00e8mes, notamment le nom d\u2019un membre de la famille de la plaignante. Non seulement le nom de cet individu pose un probl\u00e8me, mais il faut \u00e9viter que le croisement des informations qui se retrouveraient dans la sph\u00e8re publique, notamment le nom de t\u00e9moins et leur emplacement de travail au sein de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 au moment des faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, ne permette \u00e0 l\u2019ancien partenaire d\u2019identifier cette derni\u00e8re et de la retrouver. Le Tribunal est \u00e9galement conscient qu\u2019il faut \u00e9viter de susciter chez l\u2019ancien partenaire une r\u00e9action qui le pousserait \u00e0 tenter de retrouver la plaignante et ses enfants, et ce, en raison des enjeux de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans ce dossier.\n[65] Encore une fois, le Tribunal rappelle que le risque s\u00e9rieux dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier n\u2019est pas qu\u2019un simple embarras si l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante et ses informations personnelles devaient \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9es. Il existe, dans notre cas, des risques quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de ses enfants, ce qui inclut des menaces de mort qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es par l\u2019ancien partenaire envers les femmes qui le d\u00e9nonceraient. Il faut \u00e9viter, dans le meilleur des mondes, que la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal remette la plaignante et ses enfants dans une situation de danger.\n[66] Pour ce faire, l\u2019identit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins de toutes les parties sera prot\u00e9g\u00e9e. Lorsque les parties d\u00e9poseront leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et leur liste de t\u00e9moins, elles devront les identifier par les initiales de leur pr\u00e9nom et de leur nom de famille. Les initiales des noms des t\u00e9moins doivent \u00e9galement \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es dans l\u2019ensemble des correspondances, documents et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au dossier du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. Les noms des t\u00e9moins dans les correspondances du Tribunal, les sommaires de gestion d\u2019instance, les courriels, etc. seront remplac\u00e9s par leurs initiales si une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier est faite.\n[67] Comme il en sera question plus loin, les noms des t\u00e9moins pourront \u00eatre utilis\u00e9s lors des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance et durant l\u2019audience, sous certaines conditions, qui seront expliqu\u00e9es plus loin.\n(iii) Emplacements g\u00e9ographiques\n[68] Le Tribunal croit qu\u2019il existe un risque s\u00e9rieux que si l\u2019ancien partenaire de la plaignante devait apprendre l\u2019emplacement de son emploi chez la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, il puisse \u00eatre en mesure de faire le lien entre elle, la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et les all\u00e9gations de violence conjugale qui le concernent. L\u2019objectif est effectivement d\u2019\u00e9viter que le croisement d\u2019informations permette \u00e0 cet homme de retrouver la plaignante et ses enfants, et de susciter chez lui le d\u00e9sir de la retrouver.\n[69] Afin d\u2019\u00e9quilibrer la demande de la plaignante et l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9bat judiciaire soit public et transparent, le Tribunal \u00e9vitera de faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au lieu d\u2019emploi de la plaignante dans sa d\u00e9cision finale. S\u2019il doit le faire, il utilisera l\u2019emplacement g\u00e9ographique de la province en question dans ce dossier.\n[70] Si les parties ou les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, doivent mentionner un emplacement, le Tribunal demande qu\u2019elles utilisent l\u2019emplacement g\u00e9ographique de la province en question dans ce dossier.\n[71] Pour le dossier officiel du Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour, si une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier est faite par un membre du public ou un m\u00e9dia, le Tribunal retirera toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 un emplacement g\u00e9ographique, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province.\n[72] Les parties devront, lorsqu\u2019elles d\u00e9poseront une nouvelle version de leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, une liste de documents, les noms des t\u00e9moins, les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de leur t\u00e9moignage et tous les documents futurs d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le dossier du Tribunal, retirer les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province.\n[73] Pour les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qui seront d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les parties et les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, devront retirer tous les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques qui y sont mentionn\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province.\n(iv) Interdiction de publication\n[74] Bien qu\u2019aucun m\u00e9dia n\u2019ait manifest\u00e9 un int\u00e9r\u00eat pour la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure, le Tribunal estime qu\u2019un risque s\u00e9rieux \u2013 c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de ses enfants, notamment au regard des menaces de mort qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es par cet ancien partenaire envers les femmes qui le d\u00e9nonceraient \u2013 existe et qu\u2019il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la plaignante et de ses enfants que ses informations personnelles soient prot\u00e9g\u00e9es. Le Tribunal ordonne une interdiction de publication \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des noms de la plaignante et de ses enfants, de leurs informations personnelles, des noms des t\u00e9moins et des emplacements g\u00e9ographiques pertinents, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province en question dans ce dossier.\n[75] Afin de trouver cet \u00e9quilibre avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique, et comme il en sera question dans la prochaine section, les membres du public et les m\u00e9dias seront autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 regarder et \u00e9couter l\u2019audience. Cependant, l\u2019interdiction de publication les emp\u00eache de divulguer les informations identifi\u00e9es par le Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de l\u2019audience afin de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante et de ses enfants.\n(v) Enregistrement des audiences\n[76] Le Tribunal conclut qu\u2019il existe aussi un risque s\u00e9rieux li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 des enregistrements audios de l\u2019audience par l\u2019ancien partenaire et le risque qu\u2019il soit en mesure de croiser des informations qui lui permettraient d\u2019identifier la plaignante et de la retracer. Encore une fois, le risque, dans ce dossier-ci, est important.\n[77] Afin de permettre un \u00e9quilibre entre l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que le d\u00e9bat judiciaire soit public et afin de prot\u00e9ger suffisamment la plaignante et ses enfants, et compte tenu des risques s\u00e9rieux qui existent dans ce dossier, notamment quant aux menaces de mort qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 prof\u00e9r\u00e9es, le Tribunal permettra au public et aux m\u00e9dias de regarder et \u00e9couter l\u2019audience, sous r\u00e9serve de l\u2019interdiction de publication en vigueur.\n[78] Durant l\u2019audience, afin de s\u2019assurer que la plaignante, ses t\u00e9moins et ceux de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 puissent parler sans r\u00e9serve et afin de permettre que l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roule de la mani\u00e8re la plus fluide que possible, le Tribunal permettra \u00e0 tous les participants d\u2019utiliser les noms de toutes les personnes impliqu\u00e9es dans la proc\u00e9dure et pourront aussi faire r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux emplacements g\u00e9ographiques qui sont pertinents en l\u2019instance. Le Tribunal veut que les participants puissent pr\u00e9senter leur preuve pleinement et enti\u00e8rement et sans retenue.\n[79] Cependant, les enregistrements audios de l\u2019audience seront scell\u00e9s et inaccessibles aux publics et aux m\u00e9dias jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la destruction du dossier par le Tribunal. Les noms de la plaignante, de ses enfants, ses informations personnelles, les noms des t\u00e9moins, les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques pertinents dans ce dossier, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province, sont \u00e9galement frapp\u00e9s d\u2019une interdiction de publication. Autrement dit, aucun participant \u00e0 l\u2019audience, membre du public ou m\u00e9dia ne peut publier ces informations.\n[80] Quant aux proc\u00e8s-verbaux d\u2019audience, ils seront \u00e9galement accessibles au public et aux m\u00e9dias (alin\u00e9a 47(1)(l) des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne, 2021, DORS\/2021-137), mais ils devront respecter les ordonnances du Tribunal quant \u00e0 l\u2019interdiction de publication, l\u2019utilisation des noms de la plaignante, de ses enfants et des t\u00e9moins, et la protection de ses informations personnelles et des emplacements g\u00e9ographiques.\n[81] La seule exception est la suivante : les parties et les personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es dans le dossier pourront avoir acc\u00e8s aux enregistrements audios, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, mais il leur est interdit de distribuer de tels enregistrements \u00e0 quiconque, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des cours de supervision si un contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision finale du Tribunal devait \u00eatre demand\u00e9.\n(vi) Audience en personne\n[82] Le Tribunal estime qu\u2019une autre mesure pour prot\u00e9ger la plaignante serait de tenir une audience en personne dans des bureaux f\u00e9d\u00e9raux, \u00e0 un lieu \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer, afin que les all\u00e9es et venues des membres du public puissent \u00eatre contr\u00f4l\u00e9es.\n[83] Malheureusement, les audiences virtuelles ne permettent pas un contr\u00f4le aussi strict qu\u2019en personne. Le Tribunal rappelle qu\u2019il est interdit aux membres du public et aux m\u00e9dias d\u2019intervenir dans l\u2019audience, d\u2019ouvrir leur cam\u00e9ra et leur microphone. M\u00eame si le Tribunal tient une liste des individus ayant demand\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ses audiences virtuelles et m\u00eame s\u2019il peut \u00e9mettre une ordonnance d\u2019exclusion des t\u00e9moins, il est plus difficile de contr\u00f4ler qui se trouve r\u00e9ellement derri\u00e8re la cam\u00e9ra en virtuel comparativement \u00e0 une audience en personne.\n[84] Ainsi, et sans trancher sur la question, le Tribunal proposera aux parties que l\u2019audience se tienne en personne, \u00e0 un lieu \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer. Cette proposition sera discut\u00e9e avec les parties ult\u00e9rieurement. Le Tribunal est soucieux du fait que le mode d\u2019audience doit avoir du sens pour les parties et qu\u2019il peut \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019accommoder les participants \u00e0 l\u2019audience, dans la mesure du possible.\n(vii) R\u00e9tention de comp\u00e9tence et applicabilit\u00e9 des ordonnances\n[85] La demande de la Commission selon laquelle le Tribunal retient sa comp\u00e9tence sur la question de la confidentialit\u00e9 est inutile. De m\u00eame, il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour le Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que ses ordonnances demeurent applicables malgr\u00e9 la fin du dossier.\n[86] Les ordonnances du Tribunal s\u2019appliquent pour le pass\u00e9, le pr\u00e9sent et le futur dans le dossier, et ce, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la destruction du dossier officiel du Tribunal conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses politiques en la mati\u00e8re. Le Tribunal peut formuler ses ordonnances pour en assurer la p\u00e9rennit\u00e9 sans pourtant avoir \u00e0 mentionner qu\u2019elles demeureront en vigueur malgr\u00e9 la fin de l\u2019instruction. Une telle ordonnance est donc inutile.\n[87] Quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9tention de comp\u00e9tence, le Tribunal note qu\u2019il conserve l\u2019enti\u00e8re comp\u00e9tence sur sa proc\u00e9dure tant et aussi longtemps que l\u2019instruction n\u2019est pas termin\u00e9e et que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas dispos\u00e9 de la plainte. Une fois que le dossier de plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 et que le Tribunal a \u00e9puis\u00e9 son mandat en vertu de la LCDP, il est alors dessaisi de sa comp\u00e9tence (functus officio).\n[88] Sauf dans des circonstances exceptionnelles, comme l\u2019a \u00e9tabli la Cour supr\u00eame dans Chandler c. Alberta Association of Architects, 1989 CanLII 41 (CSC), [1989] 2 RCS 848, sur la notion de functus officio qui s\u2019applique aussi aux d\u00e9cideurs administratifs, le Tribunal ne peut revenir sur ses d\u00e9cisions d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendues alors qu\u2019il a rempli le mandat confi\u00e9 et qu\u2019il a accompli sa raison d\u2019\u00eatre au titre de la LCDP.\n[89] Ce faisant, le soussign\u00e9 n\u2019accepte pas de garder la comp\u00e9tence sur la question de la confidentialit\u00e9 pour le futur, ce qui voudrait autrement dire que le Tribunal ne garderait pas la porte ouverte afin de traiter de la confidentialit\u00e9 dans ce dossier, et ce, apr\u00e8s que la plainte ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e et qu\u2019une d\u00e9cision finale ait \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue.\n[90] Toutefois, les parties peuvent toujours soumettre des demandes additionnelles en mati\u00e8re de confidentialit\u00e9 durant la proc\u00e9dure, si cela est n\u00e9cessaire, ou demander au Tribunal de reconsid\u00e9rer durant la proc\u00e9dure certaines ordonnances s\u2019il existe des motifs ou des circonstances sp\u00e9ciales justifiant la reconsid\u00e9ration de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance.\nV. Ordonnance [91] En r\u00e9sum\u00e9, le Tribunal \u00e9met les ordonnances suivantes, qui doivent \u00eatre lues \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des motifs expliqu\u00e9s dans cette d\u00e9cision pour plus de d\u00e9tails.\n[92] Anonymisation de la plaignante et protection de ses informations personnelles :\nDans toute la proc\u00e9dure, la plaignante doit \u00eatre identifi\u00e9e par les lettres K. L.; Dans toute la proc\u00e9dure, les informations personnelles de la plaignante, ce qui inclut notamment son adresse courriel, son adresse de r\u00e9sidence, son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et autres informations d\u2019identification personnelle, seront prot\u00e9g\u00e9es; Pour tout document futur d\u00e9pos\u00e9 dans le dossier du Tribunal, les parties doivent s\u2019assurer de caviarder toutes les informations identifiant la plaignante, notamment son adresse courriel, son adresse de r\u00e9sidence, son num\u00e9ro de t\u00e9l\u00e9phone et autres informations d\u2019identification personnelle; En cas de demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier officiel du Tribunal, toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence pass\u00e9e ou future au nom de la plaignante sera remplac\u00e9e par K. L. et toute autre information personnelle qui se trouve dans les documents demand\u00e9s, ce qui pourrait inclure les correspondances, instructions et sommaires de t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence de gestion d\u2019instance, sera prot\u00e9g\u00e9; Les observations et les pi\u00e8ces relatives \u00e0 cette d\u00e9cision sont scell\u00e9es au titre du paragraphe 52(2) de la LCDP; L\u2019ensemble des d\u00e9cisions, correspondances, courriels et sommaires des t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance futurs du Tribunal nommeront la plaignante par les lettres K. L.; Les enregistrements des conf\u00e9rences de gestion d\u2019instance seront scell\u00e9s et seront inaccessibles. Si les parties ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7u des copies de ces enregistrements, il leur est interdit de les distribuer.\n[93] Anonymisation des t\u00e9moins :\nL\u2019identit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins de toutes les parties sera prot\u00e9g\u00e9e; Dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties et leur liste de t\u00e9moins, le nom des t\u00e9moins doit \u00eatre remplac\u00e9 par les premi\u00e8res lettres de leur pr\u00e9nom et nom de famille; Les initiales des noms des t\u00e9moins doivent \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es dans l\u2019ensemble des correspondances, documents, \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ou autres documents qui sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9s au dossier du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019avenir; Si une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier officiel du Tribunal est faite, les noms des t\u00e9moins dans les correspondances, les sommaires de gestion d\u2019instance, les courriels du Tribunal, etc. seront remplac\u00e9s par les initiales de leurs noms et pr\u00e9noms.\n[94] Emplacements g\u00e9ographiques :\nDans les proc\u00e9dures et les documents connexes, les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques sont prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, et seulement le nom de la province peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9; Pour le dossier du Tribunal jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce jour, si une demande d\u2019acc\u00e8s au dossier est faite, les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques seront retir\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province; Pour tous les documents futurs qui seront d\u00e9pos\u00e9s dans le dossier du Tribunal, ce qui inclut les nouveaux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties, les listes de t\u00e9moins, les r\u00e9sum\u00e9s de t\u00e9moignages, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 l\u2019audience, ou autres, les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de la province, doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.\n[95] Interdiction de publication :\nIl est interdit de publier les noms de la plaignante et de ses enfants, ses informations personnelles, les noms des t\u00e9moins et les emplacements g\u00e9ographiques pertinents, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du nom de la province.\n[96] Enregistrements audios de l\u2019audience et proc\u00e8s-verbaux :\nLes enregistrements audios de l\u2019audience seront scell\u00e9s et inaccessibles \u00e0 tous, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des parties et des personnes int\u00e9ress\u00e9es, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, et il leur sera interdit de les distribuer, \u00e0 l\u2019exception des cours de supervision en cas de contr\u00f4le judiciaire; Les proc\u00e8s-verbaux de l\u2019audience seront \u00e9galement accessibles au public et aux m\u00e9dias, mais la plaignante sera nomm\u00e9e par les initiales K.

Aper\u00e7u et d\u00e9cision\n[1] Annie Oleson \u00e9tait une membre a\u00een\u00e9e de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Wagmatcook, l\u2019intim\u00e9e, lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) en 2014. Selon sa plainte, Wagmatcook a commis envers elle un acte discriminatoire fond\u00e9 sur la d\u00e9ficience en ne lui fournissant pas un logement accessible et exempt d\u2019obstacles, ce qui va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des articles 5 et 6 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 [LCDP].\n[2] Le 28 d\u00e9cembre 2016, la Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u2019instruire la plainte de Mme Oleson. Malheureusement, Mme Oleson est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e en f\u00e9vrier 2017. La plaignante dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est maintenant la succession d\u2019Annie Oleson, repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le fils de cette derni\u00e8re, Joseph Oleson.\n[3] Depuis le d\u00e9but de 2018, le Tribunal instruit la pr\u00e9sente plainte au moyen de son processus de gestion d\u2019instance. Ce processus comprend l\u2019\u00e9change d\u2019expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, de listes de t\u00e9moins et de documents potentiellement pertinents, ainsi que le r\u00e8glement de diff\u00e9rends afin de faire en sorte que l\u2019audience sur la plainte puisse se d\u00e9rouler dans les meilleurs d\u00e9lais.\n[4] Le Tribunal a tenu plus de 15 conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires avec les parties et a aussi rendu deux d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate. Une de ces d\u00e9cisions concerne la port\u00e9e de la plainte (2019 TCDP 35 (CanLII)), et l\u2019autre porte sur les types de r\u00e9parations que le Tribunal peut accorder en d\u00e9pit du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Mme Oleson (2020 TCDP 29 (CanLII)).\n[5] Wagmatcook et la Commission ont aussi sign\u00e9 un compte rendu de r\u00e8glement concernant les questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et les r\u00e9parations que la Commission revendiquait relativement \u00e0 la plainte. La succession de Mme Oleson n\u2019est pas partie \u00e0 ce compte rendu de r\u00e8glement. Les parties se sont efforc\u00e9es de r\u00e9gler l\u2019aspect individuel de la plainte en prenant part \u00e0 deux m\u00e9diations assist\u00e9es par le Tribunal, mais ne sont pas arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 un r\u00e8glement.\n[6] Une audience sur la plainte, qui devait durer trois semaines, a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e trois fois. Chaque fois, M. Oleson a demand\u00e9 un ajournement, pour diverses raisons. La derni\u00e8re fois que le Tribunal a accept\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience, M. Oleson a \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de fournir certains renseignements au Tribunal et aux parties au plus tard le 30 mai 2022. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 averti que, s\u2019il ne fournissait pas les renseignements demand\u00e9s au plus tard \u00e0 cette date, l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte. M. Oleson n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 la directive du Tribunal, et l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte.\n[7] Wagmatcook affirme que, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, M. Oleson ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 aux R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137 [R\u00e8gles de pratique] ni aux ordonnances et aux directives du Tribunal et qu\u2019il n\u2019a tenu absolument aucun compte des droits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que ce serait un abus de proc\u00e9dure de permettre la poursuite de la plainte.\n[8] M. Oleson s\u2019oppose au rejet de la plainte. La Commission ne se prononce pas sur la requ\u00eate en rejet de Wagmatcook.\n[9] Je suis d\u2019accord avec Wagmatcook lorsqu\u2019elle d\u00e9clare que la conduite de M. Oleson, y compris son d\u00e9faut de se conformer aux R\u00e8gles de pratique, aux d\u00e9lais et aux directives du Tribunal, et le retard que cela a entra\u00een\u00e9, constitue un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Je fais droit \u00e0 la demande de Wagmatcook de rejeter la plainte.\nII. Question en litige\n[10] Une seule question doit \u00eatre tranch\u00e9e dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision : est-ce que le non-respect, par M. Oleson, des d\u00e9lais, des directives et des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal justifie le rejet de la plainte en question?\nIII. Analyse\nA. Observations des parties\n(i) Requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[11] Wagmatcook demande le rejet de la plainte en application de la r\u00e8gle 9 des R\u00e8gles de pratique, qui conf\u00e8re au Tribunal le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte si une partie ne se conforme pas aux R\u00e8gles de pratique, \u00e0 une ordonnance du Tribunal ou \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des R\u00e8gles de pratique. En outre, Wagmatcook souligne que le Tribunal, au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019un tribunal judiciaire, \u00ab [...] a le droit d\u2019emp\u00eacher un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (Johnston c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2007 TCDP 42 (CanLII) [Johnston] au par. 31) et renvoie \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle 10 des R\u00e8gles de pratique, qui permet au Tribunal de rejeter une plainte en cas d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[12] Wagmatcook affirme que le Tribunal doit rejeter la plainte parce que, \u00e0 plusieurs reprises, le repr\u00e9sentant de la plaignante, M. Oleson, n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les R\u00e8gles de pratique, les ordonnances et les directives du Tribunal. Selon l\u2019intim\u00e9e, permettre que l\u2019instruction de la plainte en question continue entra\u00eenerait un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[13] En ce qui concerne ce que l\u2019on pourrait d\u00e9crire comme les \u00e9v\u00e9nements d\u00e9clencheurs de la requ\u00eate en question, l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle en \u00e9tait aux derni\u00e8res \u00e9tapes de sa pr\u00e9paration \u00e0 une audience de trois semaines, qui devait commencer le 25 avril 2022, lorsque l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 annul\u00e9e pour la troisi\u00e8me fois. Dans la d\u00e9cision qu\u2019il a rendue le 21 avril 2022 faisant droit \u00e0 la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Oleson, le Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier de fournir, au plus tard le 30 mai 2022, des renseignements concernant son traitement m\u00e9dical en cours. Bien que, le 26 mai 2022, le Tribunal ait rappel\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson le d\u00e9lai du 30 mai, M. Oleson n\u2019a fourni aucun renseignement avant la date limite ni aucune explication pour justifier le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas fourni les renseignements demand\u00e9s.\n[14] Wagmatcook soutient que, puisque le non-respect par M. Oleson du d\u00e9lai du 30 mai n\u2019est que le plus r\u00e9cent exemple de son m\u00e9pris \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et des droits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e dans le contexte de la proc\u00e9dure dans son ensemble et des actions de toutes les parties en ce qui a trait au d\u00e9roulement de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que M. Oleson, en plus de ses trois demandes d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience, a rarement respect\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais et les a fait reporter de nombreuses fois, par exemple : pour d\u00e9poser son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la liste de ses t\u00e9moins et le sommaire de ses d\u00e9positions; pour r\u00e9pondre aux requ\u00eates; pour communiquer des informations \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e; pour fournir ses observations ou son approbation concernant le recueil conjoint des documents et l\u2019expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits pr\u00e9par\u00e9s par la Commission. L\u2019intim\u00e9e explique que chaque report a entra\u00een\u00e9 la prolongation de la proc\u00e9dure au fil des ans, ce qui a eu des cons\u00e9quences n\u00e9gatives sur ses droits en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et ses ressources et sur l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[16] Wagmatcook fait remarquer que le Tribunal a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 deux approches ou crit\u00e8res \u00e0 utiliser pour se prononcer sur les requ\u00eates en rejet d\u2019une plainte pour cause de retard ou de non-respect des d\u00e9lais. Le Tribunal d\u00e9termine le crit\u00e8re \u00e0 appliquer selon les circonstances de l\u2019affaire (voir Johnston aux par. 29 \u00e0 31 et Chisholm c. HEA, 2019 TCDP 38 (CanLII) [Chisholm] aux par. 17 \u00e0 19). Dans la jurisprudence du Tribunal, ces crit\u00e8res sont nomm\u00e9s \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb et crit\u00e8re de Seitz. Une affaire peut \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour cause de retard si l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces deux crit\u00e8res n\u2019est pas satisfait.\n[17] L\u2019intim\u00e9e reconna\u00eet que la norme pour rejeter une plainte pour cause de retard ou de non-respect des d\u00e9lais est \u00e9lev\u00e9e, \u00ab [...] surtout dans le cas d\u2019un plaignant non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 qui a connu de graves probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 \u00bb (Chisholm au par. 2). Toutefois, elle soutient que, en l\u2019occurrence, cette norme est atteinte et d\u00e9pass\u00e9e. Wagmatcook soutient aussi que, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le crit\u00e8re \u00ab classique \u00bb et le crit\u00e8re de Seitz sont tous les deux respect\u00e9s.\n[18] Pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il faut rejeter un dossier pour retard en utilisant le \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb, le Tribunal doit \u00e9tablir : (1) s\u2019il y a eu un retard excessif; (2) si le retard est inexcusable; et (3) si l\u2019intim\u00e9e est susceptible de subir un grave pr\u00e9judice en raison de ce retard (voir Chisholm au par. 18). L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que les trois aspects sont pr\u00e9sents dans ce cas-ci.\n[19] Premi\u00e8rement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que le retard dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 excessif. Elle indique que la conduite de M. Oleson a caus\u00e9 de nombreux retards importants. Non seulement l\u2019audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e trois fois \u00e0 sa demande, mais elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 prolong\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9raisonnable en raison de son absence de r\u00e9ponse et de ses r\u00e9ponses tardives.\n[20] Deuxi\u00e8mement, Wagmatcook soutient que le retard est inexcusable. M. Oleson a donn\u00e9 diff\u00e9rentes raisons pour expliquer les ajournements demand\u00e9s et son non-respect des d\u00e9lais. Cependant, dans bon nombre des cas o\u00f9 il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les R\u00e8gles de pratique ou les directives du Tribunal, M. Oleson n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune explication ni n\u2019a fourni aucun document justificatif cr\u00e9dible et fiable.\n[21] Troisi\u00e8mement, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient avoir subi un pr\u00e9judice \u00e9norme \u00e0 cause de la conduite de M. Oleson tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte. Wagmatcook a retenu les services d\u2019une avocate et affirme avoir assum\u00e9 les frais de la pr\u00e9paration d\u2019une audience longue et complexe \u00e0 trois reprises, en plus du temps qu\u2019elle a consacr\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux nombreuses autres demandes de M. Oleson et des co\u00fbts connexes. Elle affirme ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab En raison du comportement impr\u00e9visible de M. Oleson et de son omission \u00e0 r\u00e9p\u00e9tition de respecter les d\u00e9lais et les obligations, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9t\u00e9 laiss\u00e9e dans un \u00e9tat d\u2019incertitude prolong\u00e9. L\u2019intim\u00e9e ignore quand et si la pr\u00e9sente affaire sera entendue sur le fond et, m\u00eame si elle l\u2019est, de nombreux d\u00e9tails des affirmations propos\u00e9es par M. Oleson lui sont encore inconnus, notamment s\u2019il sera possible de tenir une audience (y compris par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence) et quels t\u00e9moins, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, y participeront. \u00bb\n[22] En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Seitz s\u2019applique. Lors de l\u2019application de ce crit\u00e8re (\u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Seitz c. Canada, 2002 CFPI 456 (CanLII) [Seitz] aux par. 16 \u00e0 18), le Tribunal doit se demander si la plaignante n\u2019a \u00ab t[enu] absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais et des R\u00e8gles de pratique que le Tribunal a \u00e9tablis dans les cas o\u00f9 une affaire est laiss\u00e9e dormante trop longtemps et dans le cas o\u00f9 la plaignante ne semble pas avoir l\u2019intention de faire aboutir l\u2019affaire (voir Chisholm au par. 19).\n[23] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019il est \u00e9vident que M. Oleson n\u2019a \u00ab t[enu] absolument aucun compte \u00bb de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, ce qui constitue un abus de l\u2019administration de la justice, et que son comportement a port\u00e9 atteinte aux droits de l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale. Elle soutient que le Tribunal a fait des efforts consid\u00e9rables pour composer avec M. Oleson tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure, mais que, malgr\u00e9 les nombreux ajournements et prolongations qui lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s, il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais et les directives du Tribunal.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que M. Oleson n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il est dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 s\u2019occuper assid\u00fbment de son dossier. Elle affirme que \u00ab [...] le fait de prolonger une action sans intention de la voir aboutir peut constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (Seitz au par. 19).\n[25] Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e compatisse aux probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 de M. Oleson, elle souligne qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 assez assidu dans la poursuite de ses propres soins de sant\u00e9. Lorsque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte le 1er juin 2022, elle ignorait encore si M. Oleson \u00e9tait all\u00e9 \u00e0 son rendez-vous du 25 mai pour des soins de sant\u00e9 mentale, ce qui \u00e9tait \u00e0 l\u2019origine de l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience en avril 2022. Elle soutient que, malgr\u00e9 les d\u00e9fis pos\u00e9s par des traitements m\u00e9dicaux en cours, M. Oleson doit prendre des mesures raisonnables pour participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de plainte du Tribunal et la faire avancer.\n(ii) Plaignante\n[26] M. Oleson a envoy\u00e9 deux courriels diff\u00e9rents relativement \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Toutefois, aucun de ces deux courriels ne r\u00e9pond au fond de la requ\u00eate.\n[27] Le premier courriel a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 le 17 juin 2022, la date limite impartie \u00e0 la plaignante pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. M. Oleson confirme s\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son rendez-vous du 25 mai 2022 et indique \u00eatre all\u00e9 \u00e0 un rendez-vous de suivi le 14 juin 2022. Il affirme que ces deux rendez-vous \u00e9taient avec un th\u00e9rapeute, qui lui fixait un rendez-vous avec un psychiatre dans un proche avenir.\n[28] M. Oleson a aussi pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ce qu\u2019il d\u00e9crit comme une [traduction] \u00ab consultation d\u2019un th\u00e9rapeute clinique dat\u00e9e du 31 juillet 2019 indiquant qu[\u2019il] pr\u00e9sentai[t] des sympt\u00f4mes ressemblant \u00e0 un TSPT [trouble de stress post-traumatique] et qu[\u2019il] en pr\u00e9sente encore \u00bb. La lettre dat\u00e9e du 31 juillet 2019 provient d\u2019un th\u00e9rapeute qui affirme avoir rencontr\u00e9 M. Oleson \u00e0 deux reprises en juillet 2019. Le th\u00e9rapeute indique qu\u2019il voudrait continuer de voir r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement M. Oleson et que lui-m\u00eame et M. Oleson pr\u00e9voient prendre part ensemble \u00e0 un rendez-vous en t\u00e9l\u00e9psychiatrie \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4pital r\u00e9gional Cape Breton [traduction] \u00ab pour avoir une consultation sur les m\u00e9dicaments et\/ou pour conna\u00eetre les pratiques exemplaires \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des sympt\u00f4mes ressemblant \u00e0 un TSPT \u00bb.\n[29] Dans son courriel du 17 juin 2022, M. Oleson affirme avoir suivi et suivre actuellement un traitement m\u00e9dical contre l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. Il indique qu\u2019un TSPT est un trouble anxieux et que, quelques fois avant la pand\u00e9mie de COVID-19, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 vers un psychiatre pour le traitement d\u2019un TSPT, mais qu\u2019aucun des psychiatres vers lesquels il a \u00e9t\u00e9 dirig\u00e9 n\u2019acceptait de nouveaux patients. Il souligne qu\u2019il fournira au Tribunal le nom du psychiatre qu\u2019il consultera lorsqu\u2019il le conna\u00eetra. Toutefois, il refuse de donner cette information \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e parce que l\u2019avocate de cette derni\u00e8re a communiqu\u00e9 avec son m\u00e9decin pour lui demander s\u2019il a \u00e9crit une lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 avril 2022 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience de M. Oleson. M. Oleson d\u00e9crit cette action comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab agressive \u00bb et une [traduction] \u00ab violation r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible de [sa] vie priv\u00e9e \u00bb qui a eu un [traduction] \u00ab effet n\u00e9gatif sur les travailleurs de la sant\u00e9 qu[\u2019il] consulte et sur [leurs] relations \u00bb.\n[30] M. Oleson indique ensuite qu\u2019il demandera une enqu\u00eate sur le harc\u00e8lement de t\u00e9moins concernant la pr\u00e9sente affaire relative aux droits de la personne et qu\u2019il enverra sous peu des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve en ce qui a trait \u00e0 ce harc\u00e8lement all\u00e9gu\u00e9.\n[31] Enfin, dans les observations qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par courriel le 17 juin 2022, M. Oleson affirme que, \u00e0 l\u2019hiver 2021, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9 dans la maison de ses enfants alors qu\u2019il travaillait sur le dossier de droits de la personne de sa m\u00e8re. Il d\u00e9crit cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement comme [traduction] \u00ab un braquage de domicile qui a fini dans le sang \u00bb et indique que cela a aggrav\u00e9 son stress et son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9. De plus, il a joint \u00e0 son courriel du 17 juin 2022 des photos des blessures qu\u2019il dit avoir subies apr\u00e8s s\u2019\u00eatre fait attaquer dans une pizzeria en compagnie de sa famille. Il estime que cette attaque \u00e9tait en rapport [traduction] \u00ab avec un coup mont\u00e9 en raison de la plainte relative aux droits de la personne \u00bb. Il ne pr\u00e9cise pas \u00e0 quel moment cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement s\u2019est produit.\n[32] Outre les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es le 17 juin 2022, M. Oleson a aussi envoy\u00e9 un courriel non sollicit\u00e9 le 27 juin 2022. Puisque l\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu l\u2019occasion de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 ce courriel, je le r\u00e9sumerai ici. M. Oleson a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il cherchait activement \u00e0 obtenir un rendez-vous avec un psychiatre et a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne fournirait son nom qu\u2019au Tribunal, et non \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n[33] M. Oleson a aussi r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 qu\u2019il enverrait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve [traduction] \u00ab pour d\u00e9poser une plainte pour intimidation et harc\u00e8lement de t\u00e9moin \u00bb et a demand\u00e9 une certaine [traduction] \u00ab marge de man\u0153uvre concernant l\u2019admission de preuves \u00bb en raison de son [traduction] \u00ab manque de connaissances juridiques \u00bb et de ses [traduction] \u00ab probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 psychologique \u00bb. Il a r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9 qu\u2019il croyait que lui et sa famille avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 attaqu\u00e9s et harcel\u00e9s en lien avec la plainte et que ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements avaient nui \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9 mentale. Il a joint \u00e0 ce courriel des photos qui, selon lui, sont des photos du [traduction] \u00ab braquage de domicile \u00bb qui a eu lieu pendant qu\u2019il travaillait sur le dossier d\u2019atteinte aux droits de la personne, mais qu\u2019il ne voulait pas partager avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\n(iii) R\u00e9ponse de l\u2019intim\u00e9e\n[34] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu aux courriels envoy\u00e9s par M. Oleson les 17 et 27 juin. Elle indique que, bien que M. Oleson ait dit au Tribunal qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son rendez-vous le 25 mai 2022 et \u00e0 un rendez-vous de suivi le 14 juin, il n\u2019a fourni aucun document justificatif pour confirmer sa pr\u00e9sence ni les \u00e9tapes suivantes recommand\u00e9es, dont un plan de traitement. L\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne qu\u2019aucun calendrier n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9 sur lequel le Tribunal et elle-m\u00eame pourraient v\u00e9ritablement s\u2019appuyer.\n[35] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que, en l\u2019absence de telles informations, ses droits en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale sont consid\u00e9rablement affect\u00e9s. Rien n\u2019indique comment ou quand la pr\u00e9sente affaire progressera et aucune assurance n\u2019est donn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la question de savoir si Wagmatcook devra continuer \u00e0 assumer les frais importants associ\u00e9s \u00e0 d\u2019autres retards.\n[36] En ce qui concerne la lettre du 31 juillet 2019 du th\u00e9rapeute clinique que M. Oleson a jointe \u00e0 son courriel du 17 juin 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9e souligne qu\u2019il y est recommand\u00e9 que M. Oleson continue de rencontrer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement le th\u00e9rapeute clinique, ce qu\u2019il semble, selon ses propres observations, ne pas avoir fait. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que cette omission montre un manque de rigueur de la part de M. Oleson dans la poursuite de son propre traitement en sant\u00e9 mentale.\n[37] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que les informations concernant les attaques qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 perp\u00e9tr\u00e9es contre M. Oleson et sa famille et les all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l\u2019intim\u00e9e \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9e ne sont pas pertinentes pour les fins de la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte et n\u2019ont pas leur place dans les observations en r\u00e9ponse. Wagmatcook nie les all\u00e9gations d\u2019intimidation ou de harc\u00e8lement du t\u00e9moin, sur lesquelles M. Oleson n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune pr\u00e9cision.\n[38] Wagmatcook soutient que M. Oleson a continu\u00e9 d\u2019ignorer les exigences en mati\u00e8re d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale et les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal en omettant d\u2019envoyer en copie conforme \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e sa lettre du 27 juin 2022 et en joignant des photos sur lesquelles il a l\u2019intention de s\u2019appuyer dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure de plainte, mais qui n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9es lors de la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience.\n[39] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que M. Oleson n\u2019a pas d\u00e9montr\u00e9 son intention de faire aboutir l\u2019affaire en question. Au lieu de cela, il continue de dire qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sentera plus d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. Wagmatcook r\u00e9it\u00e8re que le fait de prolonger une affaire sans intention de la faire aboutir peut constituer un abus de proc\u00e9dure (Seitz au par. 19).\n[40] L\u2019intim\u00e9e affirme que M. Oleson, dans ses observations, ne trace aucune voie \u00e0 suivre pour la proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019il continue de recourir \u00e0 des tactiques qui retardent la proc\u00e9dure et qui, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, ont caus\u00e9 un pr\u00e9judice important \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e.\nB. Motifs du rejet de la plainte\n[41] Je suis d\u2019avis que le Tribunal doit appliquer l\u2019approche \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Seitz pour d\u00e9terminer si la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutienne qu\u2019il y a eu un retard excessif dans ce cas-ci, de sorte que le \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb pourrait aussi \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9 aux faits, je ne suis pas d\u2019avis que ce soit l\u2019approche appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 appliquer dans les circonstances de la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[42] Le \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb exige une conclusion selon laquelle il y a eu un retard excessif. Le Tribunal peut avoir \u00e0 examiner \u2013 lorsque les faits de la cause le justifient \u2013 si le \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb s\u2019applique encore, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision r\u00e9cente de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Law Society of Saskatchewan c. Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29 (CanLII) [Abrametz], qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue apr\u00e8s les observations finales de l\u2019intim\u00e9e concernant sa requ\u00eate. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Abrametz, la Cour supr\u00eame s\u2019est pench\u00e9e sur la question du retard excessif dans le contexte de proc\u00e9dures administratives qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 examin\u00e9e dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44 (CanLII). Dans les deux cas, la Cour supr\u00eame a adopt\u00e9 une analyse \u00e0 trois volets pour d\u00e9terminer si un d\u00e9lai qui ne porte pas atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 d\u2019une audience constitue n\u00e9anmoins un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Cette analyse diff\u00e8re l\u00e9g\u00e8rement du \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb.\n[43] Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la requ\u00eate concerne davantage le non-respect par la plaignante des R\u00e8gles de pratique et des directives du Tribunal que le fait que l\u2019affaire prend beaucoup de temps dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Dans la mesure o\u00f9 on ne parvient pas \u00e0 voir la fin de la proc\u00e9dure en raison de la conduite de M. Oleson, il pourrait probablement y avoir une conclusion \u00e9ventuelle de retard excessif. Cependant, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure dont il est question ici diff\u00e8re de celui dans Abrametz (et je souligne que la Cour supr\u00eame a conclu que le retard dans l\u2019affaire en question \u00e9tait long, mais non excessif).\n[44] L\u2019approche \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans Seitz exige que le Tribunal conclue qu\u2019il n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00ab t[enu] absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais et des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal, dans une affaire qui est demeur\u00e9e statique pendant trop longtemps, et que la plaignante semble ne pas avoir l\u2019intention de faire aboutir le dossier. Ce crit\u00e8re est appropri\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en vertu de la r\u00e8gle 9 des R\u00e8gles de pratique, qui accorde au Tribunal le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte en cas de non-respect des R\u00e8gles de pratique, d\u2019une ordonnance du Tribunal ou d\u2019un d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des R\u00e8gles de pratique.\n(i) M\u00e9pris total \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9lais et des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal\n[45] Conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 2(2) des R\u00e8gles de pratique, toutes les parties ont consenti \u00e0 l\u2019application des R\u00e8gles de pratique de 2021 du Tribunal \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente affaire. Selon la r\u00e8gle 5, les \u00ab r\u00e8gles sont interpr\u00e9t\u00e9es et appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 permettre de trancher la plainte sur le fond de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable, informelle et rapide \u00bb. Cette r\u00e8gle tient compte de l\u2019exigence l\u00e9gislative selon laquelle l\u2019instruction des plaintes \u00ab se fait sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb (par. 48.9(1) de la LCDP).\n[46] Les R\u00e8gles de pratique pr\u00e9cisent aussi que le Tribunal r\u00e9git le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instruction, de la gestion d\u2019instance jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019audience, en passant par les requ\u00eates (par. 3(2)), et elles donnent au Tribunal le pouvoir d\u2019\u00e9tablir des d\u00e9lais afin que la proc\u00e9dure continue de progresser vers l\u2019audience. Ainsi, tous les d\u00e9lais impos\u00e9s par le Tribunal relativement \u00e0 la gestion d\u2019instance, aux requ\u00eates et \u00e0 la pr\u00e9paration de l\u2019audience sont fix\u00e9s sous le r\u00e9gime des R\u00e8gles de pratique, en ce qui concerne l\u2019application de la r\u00e8gle 9.\n[47] Tout au long des cinq ann\u00e9es pendant lesquelles la pr\u00e9sente affaire a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une gestion d\u2019instance au Tribunal, M. Oleson n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les directives ni la quasi-totalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal en vertu de ses R\u00e8gles de pratique, ou il a demand\u00e9 des prolongations. De plus, chaque fois que l\u2019audience sur la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue, M. Oleson a demand\u00e9 un ajournement. Les faits ci-dessous concernant la conduite de M. Oleson depuis que la premi\u00e8re audience sur le dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue appuient une conclusion selon laquelle M. Oleson n\u2019a tenu absolument aucun compte des d\u00e9lais et des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal.\n[48] En avril 2021, M. Oleson a demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en juin 2021 parce qu\u2019il devait subir une chirurgie en mai 2021, et il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il aurait besoin de temps pour s\u2019en remettre. Il a demand\u00e9 le report de l\u2019audience \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2021. M. Oleson a accept\u00e9 de fournir, au plus tard le 16 avril 2021, une confirmation de la part de son chirurgien ou de son m\u00e9decin quant \u00e0 la date de sa chirurgie et la dur\u00e9e de sa convalescence. Toutefois, il n\u2019a fourni ces informations qu\u2019\u00e0 la fin avril. Une fois ces informations re\u00e7ues, toutes les parties ont convenu d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience, et les dates d\u2019audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9es en octobre et novembre 2021.\n[49] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire suivante tenue en juillet 2021, M. Oleson a fait savoir qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas encore subi sa chirurgie, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas responsable du retard. Afin d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00eat \u00e0 commencer l\u2019audience en octobre 2021, M. Oleson avait jusqu\u2019au 25 ao\u00fbt 2021 pour demander toute autre communication de documents de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et pour fournir les documents, photos ou vid\u00e9os qu\u2019il lui restait \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e et \u00e0 la Commission. Au lieu de cela, il a attendu jusqu\u2019au 25 ao\u00fbt pour demander une prorogation de trois semaines parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab tr\u00e8s malade \u00bb. Il s\u2019est vu accorder une prorogation et un nouveau d\u00e9lai ferme a \u00e9t\u00e9 fix\u00e9 au 8 septembre 2021. Le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson que tout report de d\u00e9lai si proche de la date d\u2019audience a un effet sur la capacit\u00e9 des autres parties \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[50] M. Oleson n\u2019avait fourni aucun billet de m\u00e9decin \u00e0 l\u2019appui de la demande de prorogation qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 25 ao\u00fbt 2021. Puisque ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019il avait indiqu\u00e9 que des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 l\u2019emp\u00eachaient de respecter les d\u00e9lais, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que toute autre demande de prorogation ou de report pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Oleson pour cause de maladie ne soit examin\u00e9e que si elle \u00e9tait appuy\u00e9e par un document m\u00e9dical.\n[51] Le 8 septembre 2021, M. Oleson a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une demande vaste et longue visant \u00e0 obtenir d\u2019autres informations et documents de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, dont certains ne concernaient pas la plainte. Cette question avait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal en 2019 (dans l\u2019affaire 2019 TCDP 35 (CanLII)).\n[52] Dans le cadre de sa demande du 8 septembre 2021, M. Oleson a aussi demand\u00e9 que toutes les informations qui lui avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 fournies pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment par les autres parties lui soient renvoy\u00e9es. Il s\u2019agissait de la deuxi\u00e8me fois qu\u2019il demandait \u00e0 ce que lui soient fournies des informations qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 re\u00e7ues. De plus, M. Oleson a ajout\u00e9 plusieurs nouveaux t\u00e9moins \u00e0 sa liste de t\u00e9moins et a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait encore l\u2019intention de fournir des vid\u00e9os et d\u2019autres informations plus tard, en d\u00e9pit de la directive qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e de fournir toutes ces informations au plus tard le 8 septembre 2021.\n[53] En raison de cette longue demande de la part de M. Oleson si pr\u00e8s de l\u2019audience, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 d\u2019annuler les dates d\u2019audience en octobre pour lui permettre d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre, tout en conservant la semaine d\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en novembre 2021. Toutes les parties et le Tribunal en sont convenus. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a agi avec diligence et rapidit\u00e9 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la demande de M. Oleson.\n[54] La conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire suivante \u00e9tait pr\u00e9vue le 13 octobre 2021. M. Oleson ne s\u2019est pas joint \u00e0 l\u2019appel et, lorsque l\u2019agent du greffe a communiqu\u00e9 avec lui, M. Oleson l\u2019a inform\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne se sentait pas bien et qu\u2019il ne participerait pas. Ladite conf\u00e9rence a \u00e9t\u00e9 report\u00e9e au 15 octobre 2021.\n[55] Durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 15 octobre, M. Oleson a demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en novembre 2021. Il a indiqu\u00e9 avoir eu du mal \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience parce qu\u2019il souffrait d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de TSPT, bien qu\u2019il ait omis de pr\u00e9senter le document m\u00e9dical exig\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019appui de cette affirmation. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, il a assur\u00e9 \u00e0 tout le monde prenant part \u00e0 l\u2019appel qu\u2019il se sentait mieux et qu\u2019il pourrait tout mettre en place pour une audience \u00e0 la mi-janvier 2022.\n[56] L\u2019autre question que M. Oleson a soulev\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019appui de sa demande d\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience \u00e9tait le fait que la Commission avait r\u00e9cemment annonc\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne participerait plus \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur la plainte. Jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, la Commission avait particip\u00e9 en tant que partie \u00e0 part enti\u00e8re et pr\u00e9voyait aider M. Oleson lors de son interrogatoire principal et de son contre-interrogatoire des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. La Commission avait aussi pr\u00e9vu de faire entendre elle-m\u00eame quatre t\u00e9moins. Le retrait tardif de l\u2019audience de la part de la Commission signifiait qu\u2019une plus grande responsabilit\u00e9 \u00e9tait plac\u00e9e sur les \u00e9paules de M. Oleson, qui \u00e9tait pris au d\u00e9pourvu. Bien que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ait \u00e9t\u00e9 contrari\u00e9e par les reports demand\u00e9s par M. Oleson, elle a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00eat pour l\u2019audience en novembre.\n[57] La Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e ont toutes deux dit avoir des doutes quant \u00e0 l\u2019engagement de M. Oleson \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la proc\u00e9dure. Elles ont soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris au d\u00e9pourvu \u00e0 plusieurs reprises durant le processus pr\u00e9paratoire, qu\u2019il avait manqu\u00e9 des d\u00e9lais et qu\u2019il avait demand\u00e9 plusieurs prorogations. Elles se sont aussi demand\u00e9 si M. Oleson avait les documents que les autres parties lui avaient fournis \u00e0 diff\u00e9rents moments durant le processus de gestion d\u2019instance, et ce, m\u00eame si elles lui avaient transmis leurs documents plus d\u2019une fois.\n[58] M\u00eame s\u2019il ne participait plus \u00e0 l\u2019audience, les conseillers juridiques de la Commission aidaient encore les parties \u00e0 pr\u00e9parer un recueil conjoint des documents et un expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits. La Commission a indiqu\u00e9 que, bien que le recueil conjoint des documents \u00e9tait pr\u00eat, M. Oleson continuait de contester les informations fournies par l\u2019intim\u00e9e, et il parlait encore d\u2019\u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de la plainte, bien que cette question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e par le Tribunal en 2019. La Commission a sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que, si l\u2019audience \u00e9tait ajourn\u00e9e, les autres d\u00e9lais de M. Oleson devaient \u00eatre fermes.\n[59] J\u2019ai convenu que l\u2019affaire avait pris beaucoup de temps \u00e0 \u00eatre entendue et qu\u2019il \u00e9tait injuste pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019avoir \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience tout en ne sachant pas si M. Oleson serait pr\u00eat. J\u2019ai reconnu qu\u2019une grande partie du retard \u00e0 ce stade \u00e9tait attribuable \u00e0 M. Oleson. Toutefois, je comprenais que le retrait de la Commission \u00e0 une date aussi tardive avait plac\u00e9 une responsabilit\u00e9 et une pression consid\u00e9rables sur M. Oleson, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris au d\u00e9pourvu.\n[60] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 15 octobre 2021, j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en novembre 2021, sous r\u00e9serve que M. Oleson soit pr\u00eat pour l\u2019audience en janvier 2022, ce qui signifiait qu\u2019il devait avoir r\u00e9gl\u00e9 toutes ses questions en suspens d\u2019ici l\u00e0. J\u2019ai fix\u00e9 \u00e0 novembre 2021 les d\u00e9lais pour que M. Oleson se conforme \u00e0 la divulgation. J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 que ces d\u00e9lais et tous les d\u00e9lais futurs seraient fermes \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Oleson, ce qui signifiait qu\u2019il devait respecter les d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis afin de s\u2019assurer d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00eat pour l\u2019audience et que, dans le cas contraire, il devrait poursuivre tout de m\u00eame sans autre prorogation. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 averti que l\u2019intim\u00e9e pourrait aussi pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte s\u2019il continuait \u00e0 ne pas respecter les d\u00e9lais et les directives du Tribunal. Enfin, j\u2019ai r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 que toute demande de report pour raison de sant\u00e9 ne serait examin\u00e9e que si M. Oleson fournissait une preuve m\u00e9dicale \u00e0 l\u2019appui.\n[61] Durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 15 octobre 2021, les parties ont aussi discut\u00e9 de la possibilit\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 un autre processus de m\u00e9diation assist\u00e9e par le Tribunal, mais avec un autre membre du Tribunal. Pour \u00e9viter tout autre retard, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson d\u2019informer les autres parties au plus tard le 22 octobre s\u2019il acceptait de retenter une m\u00e9diation. Cependant, il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 ce d\u00e9lai. Il a plut\u00f4t indiqu\u00e9, le 8 novembre, qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9cart\u00e9 la possibilit\u00e9 de participer de nouveau \u00e0 une m\u00e9diation.\n[62] Le 8 novembre 2021, M. Oleson a demand\u00e9 une prorogation d\u2019au moins un mois et demi pour respecter les d\u00e9lais en novembre \u00e9tablis lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 octobre. Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il s\u2019occupait d\u2019une autre affaire juridique li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa m\u00e8re, qu\u2019il avait sa propre affaire judiciaire en cours et qu\u2019il devait demander d\u2019autres dossiers m\u00e9dicaux de sa m\u00e8re \u00e0 un h\u00f4pital pour son dossier relatif aux droits de la personne.\n[63] Le 10 novembre 2021, j\u2019ai refus\u00e9 d\u2019accorder la demande de prorogation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par M. Oleson en ces termes : [traduction] \u00ab Les parties et le Tribunal ont entendu les nombreuses excuses de M. Oleson au cours des quatre derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es concernant les raisons pour lesquelles il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais ou pour lesquelles il ne peut respecter les d\u00e9lais qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment accept\u00e9s. Il doit commencer \u00e0 prendre la pr\u00e9sente affaire plus au s\u00e9rieux et \u00e0 en faire une priorit\u00e9. \u00bb J\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 que, s\u2019il ne respectait pas les d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire du 15 octobre 2021, il ne serait pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 demander d\u2019autres documents \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e ni \u00e0 divulguer d\u2019autres documents lui-m\u00eame sans l\u2019autorisation du Tribunal, qui ne serait donn\u00e9e que dans des circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[64] Lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue en f\u00e9vrier 2022, alors que la m\u00e9diation \u00e9tait en cours devant un autre membre du Tribunal, une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue au cas o\u00f9 la m\u00e9diation serait infructueuse. L\u2019audience devait commencer le 25 avril 2022.\n[65] Puisque l\u2019affaire ne s\u2019est pas r\u00e9gl\u00e9e, une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 tenue le 6 avril 2022 pour s\u2019assurer que les parties \u00e9taient pr\u00e9par\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Lors de cette conf\u00e9rence, M. Oleson a demand\u00e9 l\u2019ajournement de l\u2019audience. Il a mentionn\u00e9 un rendez-vous prochain avec un psychologue auquel, selon lui, il devait se pr\u00e9senter avant de pouvoir proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019audience parce qu\u2019il souffrait de divers probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale qui nuisaient \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 de se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que je n\u2019examinerais aucune demande d\u2019ajournement sans avoir une preuve m\u00e9dicale d\u2019un m\u00e9decin, ce qui concordait avec les directives que j\u2019avais donn\u00e9es pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment en ao\u00fbt et en octobre 2021. Selon ces directives, M. Oleson devait fournir un document m\u00e9dical pour justifier toute autre demande d\u2019ajournement ou de prorogation li\u00e9e \u00e0 sa sant\u00e9.\n[66] Le samedi 16 avril 2022, M. Oleson a envoy\u00e9 un courriel adress\u00e9 uniquement au Tribunal et \u00e0 la Commission pour demander le report de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue le 25 avril \u00e0 une date post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son rendez-vous avec un psychologue pr\u00e9vu le 25 mai 2022. Il n\u2019a pas fait parvenir sa demande \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e comme il en avait l\u2019obligation. Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019a re\u00e7u le courriel de M. Oleson que le 19 avril. La demande \u00e9tait accompagn\u00e9e d\u2019une lettre de son m\u00e9decin dat\u00e9e du 12 avril 2022.\n[67] Dans sa lettre, le m\u00e9decin affirme avoir donn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson une consultation \u00e0 la R\u00e9gie de la sant\u00e9 de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse (la R\u00e9gie de la N.-\u00c9.) en avril 2021 parce qu\u2019il pr\u00e9sentait des sympt\u00f4mes de TSPT. M. Oleson a aussi fourni une lettre dat\u00e9e de la R\u00e9gie de la N.-\u00c9. indiquant que le dossier de consultation de ce client avait \u00e9t\u00e9 ferm\u00e9 parce qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 possible de joindre M. Oleson, mais que ce dernier pouvait communiquer avec la R\u00e9gie de la N.-\u00c9. pour obtenir un service sans une nouvelle consultation. Il semble que M. Oleson ne l\u2019ait pas fait. Au lieu de cela, son m\u00e9decin l\u2019a dirig\u00e9 de nouveau vers la R\u00e9gie de la N.-\u00c9. le 11 mars 2022, et un rendez-vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 pris pour le 25 mai 2022.\n[68] Dans la lettre du m\u00e9decin dat\u00e9e du 12 avril 2022, il est indiqu\u00e9 que M. Oleson \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab [...] en cours de traitement en raison de son stress et de son anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, et [que le m\u00e9decin] recommande fortement [...] que lui soit accord\u00e9e une prorogation de son audience relative aux droits de la personne pr\u00e9vue le 25 avril 2022, et ce, \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure \u00e0 son rendez-vous avec un psychologue pr\u00e9vu le 25 mai 2022, afin que [le Tribunal] compren[ne] mieux sa d\u00e9ficience et compos[e] mieux avec celle-ci \u00bb.\n[69] Dans la demande d\u2019ajournement qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e le 16 avril 2022, M. Oleson a indiqu\u00e9 que, m\u00eame s\u2019il participait \u00e0 des appels de m\u00e9diation depuis les derni\u00e8res semaines, il demandait au Tribunal de reporter l\u2019audience \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure au 25 mai afin qu\u2019il puisse avoir les [traduction] \u00ab outils \u00bb lui permettant d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant et que le Tribunal tienne ainsi compte de sa d\u00e9ficience.\n[70] J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience en raison de la lettre du m\u00e9decin de M. Oleson. J\u2019ai admis que M. Oleson avait l\u2019appui de son m\u00e9decin, qui recommandait fortement que l\u2019audience soit ajourn\u00e9e pour lui permettre de se faire soigner. Toutefois, j\u2019\u00e9tais aussi en accord avec l\u2019observation de l\u2019intim\u00e9e selon laquelle M. Oleson ne semblait pas s\u2019\u00eatre efforc\u00e9 d\u2019obtenir des soins de sant\u00e9 mentale au cours de la derni\u00e8re ann\u00e9e, bien qu\u2019il ait re\u00e7u une premi\u00e8re consultation de son m\u00e9decin en avril 2021.\n[71] J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 dans ma d\u00e9cision d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience que M. Oleson avait demand\u00e9 bon nombre de prorogations au Tribunal sur plus de quatre ann\u00e9es de gestion d\u2019instance, de m\u00eame que trois ajournements, et qu\u2019il avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de nombreuses excuses pour ses retards qui avaient contrari\u00e9 toutes les parties en cause. J\u2019ai affirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il se souciait peu du temps consacr\u00e9 et des frais assum\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9e chaque fois qu\u2019elle devait se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 une audience, qui finalement \u00e9tait ajourn\u00e9e. J\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 que, lorsque le Tribunal et les conseillers juridiques pr\u00e9voient trois semaines dans leur agenda pour l\u2019audience, nous ne pouvons pr\u00e9voir rien d\u2019autre, ce qui a aussi un effet sur les autres parties devant le Tribunal. J\u2019ai cit\u00e9 l\u2019affaire Constantinescu c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2018 TCDP 10 (CanLII) [Constantinescu], dans laquelle le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : \u00ab Plus le temps passe, plus grand est le pr\u00e9judice pour le public. Je rappelle qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public que les plaintes en mati\u00e8re de discrimination s\u2019allongent dans le temps [...] \u00bb (par. 38).\n[72] J\u2019ai d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019ajourner les audiences pr\u00e9vues en avril et en mai 2022, mais j\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 que, si d\u2019autres retards \u00e9taient caus\u00e9s par l\u2019omission de la part de M. Oleson de participer \u00e0 ses propres soins de sant\u00e9, il pouvait s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u00e9pose une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson de confirmer au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au plus tard le 30 mai 2022, qu\u2019il s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son rendez-vous du 25 mai 2022 et de les informer s\u2019il avait un rendez-vous de suivi pr\u00e9vu, auquel cas il devait en indiquer la date.\n[73] Apr\u00e8s avoir rendu ma d\u00e9cision d\u2019ajournement le 21 avril 2022, l\u2019avocate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 avoir communiqu\u00e9 avec le m\u00e9decin de M. Oleson lorsqu\u2019elle a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 que sa lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 avril 2022 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sur du papier \u00e0 en-t\u00eate et que son nom \u00e9tait mal \u00e9crit. Bien qu\u2019il n\u2019ait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 question des soins de sant\u00e9 de M. Oleson, le m\u00e9decin a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocate que M. Oleson s\u2019\u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 avec la lettre dat\u00e9e du 12 avril d\u00e9j\u00e0 r\u00e9dig\u00e9e et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019avait que sign\u00e9e.\n[74] En ce qui a trait \u00e0 la question de l\u2019avocate concernant la lettre du m\u00e9decin, j\u2019ai remarqu\u00e9 que je n\u2019avais aucune preuve que le m\u00e9decin \u00e9tait en d\u00e9saccord avec le contenu de la lettre qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9e. J\u2019ai conclu la correspondance que j\u2019ai transmise aux parties le 26 mai 2022 en soulignant ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Je fais remarquer qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson de confirmer au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, au plus tard le 30 mai 2022, qu\u2019il s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 \u00e0 son rendez-vous du 25 mai 2022 avec un fournisseur de soins de sant\u00e9 mentale et de les informer s\u2019il avait un rendez-vous de suivi pr\u00e9vu, auquel cas il devait en indiquer la date. S\u2019il omet de le faire, le Tribunal examinera les propositions des parties sur la fa\u00e7on de proc\u00e9der. \u00bb\n[75] M. Oleson ne s\u2019est pas conform\u00e9 \u00e0 la directive claire du Tribunal de le tenir au courant, au plus tard le 30 mai 2022, concernant son rendez-vous pour soins de sant\u00e9 mentale pr\u00e9vu le 25 mai 2022. Par cons\u00e9quent, le 1er juin 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de rejet de la plainte. J\u2019ai \u00e9tabli des d\u00e9lais pour la pr\u00e9sentation des observations des parties sur la requ\u00eate.\n[76] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, M. Oleson a envoy\u00e9 le 7 juin 2022 un courriel dans lequel il affirmait s\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au rendez-vous du 25 mai 2022. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 son intention d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant avec la plainte. Le 9 juin 2022, il a \u00e9crit de nouveau pour confirmer s\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au rendez-vous du 25 mai et avoir un rendez-vous de suivi pr\u00e9vu le 14 juin 2022. Il a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab esp[\u00e9rait] acqu\u00e9rir [...] des habilet\u00e9s d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 [son] TSPT et \u00e0 [son] anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00bb.\n[77] M. Oleson a offert de nombreuses excuses pour son non-respect des d\u00e9lais. Il promet constamment de fournir des renseignements et dit sans cesse qu\u2019il s\u2019organisera si plus de temps lui est allou\u00e9. Cependant, je conviens avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Oleson bon nombre d\u2019occasions et de concessions importantes, et que M. Oleson doit \u00eatre tenu responsable de son non-respect des directives et des d\u00e9lais \u00e9tablis par le Tribunal. L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que, dans le cas contraire, les R\u00e8gles de pratique et les directives du Tribunal perdraient en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 tout leur sens, ce qui la placerait dans une position o\u00f9 elle ne pourrait s\u2019y fier ni s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019elles soient appliqu\u00e9es.\n[78] Le dossier du Tribunal refl\u00e8te un comportement constant qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 des retards importants de la part de M. Oleson. Prise dans son ensemble, la conduite de M. Oleson d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il ne \u00ab tient absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais et des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal.\n(ii) L\u2019affaire est demeur\u00e9e statique pendant trop longtemps\n[79] En appliquant le crit\u00e8re de Seitz, je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 conclure que le retard en question a \u00e9t\u00e9 excessif. Je dois plut\u00f4t conclure que, dans les circonstances, l\u2019affaire est demeur\u00e9e statique trop longtemps, ce qui, selon moi, signifie qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas progress\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on significative.\n[80] Je conclus que l\u2019affaire est demeur\u00e9e statique pendant environ deux ans. Les faits \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la section pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente appuient cette conclusion, puisqu\u2019ils confirment que l\u2019affaire n\u2019a pas progress\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on significative depuis la premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019une audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vue, en avril 2021. Cette audience a \u00e9t\u00e9 ajourn\u00e9e en raison d\u2019une chirurgie que M. Oleson n\u2019a toujours pas subie. M\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019est peut-\u00eatre pas responsable du retard de cette chirurgie, il aurait pu profiter de ce temps pour se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Pr\u00e8s de deux ans plus tard, rien n\u2019a chang\u00e9 et, comme il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la section suivante, je n\u2019ai aucun motif de croire que quelque chose changera \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[81] Dans les circonstances de l\u2019affaire en question, la plainte est demeur\u00e9e statique trop longtemps. Le Tribunal est tenu d\u2019assurer le d\u00e9roulement rapide et \u00e9quitable de ses proc\u00e9dures pour toutes les parties, non seulement la plaignante. \u00c0 ce stade, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 l\u2019audience \u00e0 trois reprises et rien ne lui indique si ou quand une audience aura vraiment lieu. Une telle incertitude va \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019obligation du Tribunal de faire preuve de rapidit\u00e9, et il serait injuste pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e de permettre la prolongation de cette situation.\n(iii) M. Oleson semble n\u2019avoir aucune intention de faire aboutir le dossier\n[82] Le Tribunal avait convenu d\u2019ajourner l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue au printemps 2022 en se fondant sur la demande pr\u00e9cise de M. Oleson visant \u00e0 lui permettre d\u2019obtenir des soins de sant\u00e9 mentale afin qu\u2019il puisse participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, avec d\u2019\u00e9ventuelles mesures d\u2019adaptation recommand\u00e9es par un professionnel de la sant\u00e9. L\u2019ajournement \u00e9tait conditionnel \u00e0 ce que, au plus tard le 30 mai 2022, M. Oleson fasse le point sur son rendez-vous avec un psychologue pr\u00e9vu le 25 mai et fournisse des renseignements sur son plan de traitement en cours. Puisqu\u2019il a omis de le faire dans le d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la requ\u00eate en rejet de la plainte.\n[83] Au lieu de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, M. Oleson a soulev\u00e9 de nouvelles questions et a fait mention de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve. De plus, plut\u00f4t que de fournir des documents m\u00e9dicaux actuels et pertinents, il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 une lettre d\u2019un th\u00e9rapeute clinique dat\u00e9e de juillet 2019 qui indiquait qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dirig\u00e9 vers une consultation en raison de sympt\u00f4mes ressemblant \u00e0 un TSPT. Il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 cette lettre, qui datait d\u00e9j\u00e0 de trois ans, en juin 2022.\n[84] Je remarque que, le 11 octobre 2022, M. Oleson a transmis au Tribunal et aux parties un courriel dans lequel il confirmait avoir consult\u00e9 un psychiatre le 4 octobre 2022 et avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9 comme souffrant [traduction] \u00ab d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, de d\u00e9pression et de TSPT aggrav\u00e9 \u00bb. Il a aussi mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il consulterait son m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste. M. Oleson dit esp\u00e9rer que les mesures d\u2019adaptation \u00e0 ses d\u00e9ficiences seront respect\u00e9es, mais il ne fournit aucune information sur les mesures d\u2019adaptation dont il a besoin ni sur la question de savoir si ces diagnostics entra\u00eeneraient des cons\u00e9quences sur sa capacit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal.\n[85] Je reconnais que M. Oleson a pris part \u00e0 la gestion d\u2019instance de la plainte de sa m\u00e8re tout en g\u00e9rant de nombreux probl\u00e8mes personnels et en faisant le deuil de sa m\u00e8re avec laquelle il vivait et dont il prenait soin dans ses derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Bien que je n\u2019aie aucune raison de mettre en doute son affirmation selon laquelle il a \u00e9t\u00e9 diagnostiqu\u00e9 comme ayant un TSPT, de l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et une d\u00e9pression, il a encore omis de fournir au Tribunal une preuve de son traitement par un professionnel de la sant\u00e9. De m\u00eame, il n\u2019a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune preuve provenant d\u2019un professionnel de la sant\u00e9 concernant les effets de son \u00e9tat sur sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, avec des mesures d\u2019adaptation ou non. S\u2019il a un plan de traitement, il n\u2019a fourni aucune information indiquant \u00e0 quel moment il pourra prendre part \u00e0 l\u2019audience sur la plainte en question.\n[86] Il ne tenait qu\u2019\u00e0 M. Oleson de fournir au Tribunal les informations qui l\u2019auraient aid\u00e9 \u00e0 [traduction] \u00ab compren[dre] [..] sa d\u00e9ficience et [...] [\u00e0] compos[er] [...] avec celle-ci \u00bb, comme il l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans la demande d\u2019ajournement qu\u2019il a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en avril 2022. Huit mois apr\u00e8s le rendez-vous du 25 mai 2022, M. Oleson ne l\u2019a toujours pas fait. Je suis d\u2019accord avec l\u2019intim\u00e9e sur le fait que les informations limit\u00e9es que M. Oleson a fournies ne tracent aucune voie \u00e0 suivre pour le futur. Le courriel de M. Oleson du 11 octobre 2022 ne donne aucun renseignement qui permettrait au Tribunal et \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019\u00e9valuer comment ou quand l\u2019affaire peut aller de l\u2019avant. Si M. Oleson \u00e9tait s\u00e9rieux quant \u00e0 la poursuite de la plainte en question, il aurait d\u00fb agir avec diligence en fournissant aux parties et au Tribunal les informations qui les auraient aid\u00e9s \u00e0 tenir une audience rapidement, comme l\u2019exige la LCDP.\n[87] Je remarque aussi que, dans son courriel du 11 octobre 2022, M. Oleson dit qu\u2019il s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab [...] et [qu\u2019il] le fer[a] par \u00e9crit avec un peu de chance la semaine prochaine, car [il a] d\u00e9j\u00e0 un brouillon \u00bb. Il indique aussi qu\u2019il dispose de [traduction] \u00ab nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00bb qu\u2019il fournira lorsqu\u2019ils seront rassembl\u00e9s. Il conclut en affirmant qu\u2019il enverra les informations appropri\u00e9es pour que le dossier progresse. Depuis lors, il n\u2019a rien envoy\u00e9 d\u2019autre. M. Oleson avait jusqu\u2019au 17 juin 2022 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e. L\u2019affirmation qu\u2019il a faite en octobre 2022 selon laquelle il a l\u2019intention de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure est un autre exemple du fait que M. Oleson ne tient aucun compte des R\u00e8gles de pratique et des directives du Tribunal.\n[88] M. Oleson n\u2019a rien fourni au Tribunal et aux parties qui indiquerait qu\u2019il a vraiment l\u2019intention de faire progresser la pr\u00e9sente plainte vers une audience. Ses promesses et ses assurances ant\u00e9rieures de faire avancer le dossier ne se sont pas concr\u00e9tis\u00e9es. Pour le Tribunal, M. Oleson ne semble avoir aucune intention r\u00e9elle de r\u00e9gler la plainte.\n(iv) Abus de proc\u00e9dure\n[89] Le d\u00e9faut de M. Oleson de se conformer aux R\u00e8gles de pratique et aux directives du Tribunal, ses demandes de prorogation de presque tous les d\u00e9lais, ses demandes d\u2019ajournement d\u2019audience et le fait qu\u2019il renvoie continuellement \u00e0 d\u2019autres questions et \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve qu\u2019il a l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter se sont traduits par des injustices et des frais pour l\u2019intim\u00e9e, qui a retenu les services d\u2019une avocate et qui a eu \u00e0 se pr\u00e9parer \u00e0 plusieurs reprises \u00e0 l\u2019audience et \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux diff\u00e9rentes demandes de M. Oleson.\n[90] Toutefois, l\u2019approche \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans l\u2019affaire Seitz exige que le Tribunal examine l\u2019incidence des retards caus\u00e9s par M. Oleson et de son non-respect des R\u00e8gles de pratique et des directives du Tribunal non seulement \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux parties, mais aussi de l\u2019abus de la justice, \u00ab ce qui est distinct du pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par un retard excessif et inexcusable. Ce genre d\u2019affaires peut donner lieu \u00e0 une conclusion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00bb (Chisholm au par. 19; voir aussi Mattice c. Westower Communications Ltd., 2014 TCDP 32 (CanLII) [Mattice] au par. 41).\n[91] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public que les plaintes en mati\u00e8re des droits de la personne s\u2019allongent dans le temps. Il est charg\u00e9 d\u2019instruire les plaintes de fa\u00e7on informelle et rapide, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses R\u00e8gles de pratique et aux principes de justice naturelle. \u00ab Plus le temps passe, plus grand est le pr\u00e9judice pour le public \u00bb (Constantinescu au par. 38).\n[92] Le processus de plainte relatif aux droits de la personne est con\u00e7u pour assurer le respect des droits des plaignants, qui sont parfois des membres tr\u00e8s vuln\u00e9rables de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Cependant, le Tribunal est aussi tenu de respecter les principes de justice naturelle, ce qui signifie qu\u2019il a le devoir d\u2019agir \u00e9quitablement envers toutes les parties. \u00ab [L]e Tribunal s\u2019emploie d\u00fbment \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des parties qui se repr\u00e9sentent elles-m\u00eames pour leur donner amplement et pleinement la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter leur cause, mais [il] ne le fait pas au d\u00e9triment des autres parties ou du Tribunal \u00bb (Mattice au par. 51).\n[93] Le comportement de M. Oleson constitue un abus de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. La proc\u00e9dure est non seulement injuste pour la Premi\u00e8re Nation intim\u00e9e, mais aussi pour le Tribunal et pour la Commission, qui sont tous deux financ\u00e9s par les contribuables et qui ont tous deux beaucoup d\u2019autres plaintes qui ont tout autant droit \u00e0 leur temps et leurs ressources. La LCDP exige une r\u00e9solution raisonnablement rapide des plaintes pour atteinte aux droits de la personne, ce qui ne s\u2019est pas produit et ne se produira pas dans l\u2019affaire en question.\n[94] J\u2019ai aussi examin\u00e9 le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante en raison du rejet de la plainte. Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, la plaignante elle-m\u00eame est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e, et M. Oleson repr\u00e9sente sa succession. L\u2019aspect li\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de la plainte a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9gl\u00e9 entre la Commission et l\u2019intim\u00e9e. Si je tiens compte des faits de l\u2019affaire, de l\u2019exigence d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de l\u2019importance de mener \u00e0 terme les plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne, du devoir d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 envers toutes les parties et de tout pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 aux parties et \u00e0 la justice, je conclus que la balance penche clairement en faveur du rejet de la plainte.\nIV.

Pour le moment, la d\u00e9cision est uniquement disponible dans sa langue d\u2019origine, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire en anglais. Si vous souhaitez obtenir une copie de cette d\u00e9cision dans sa langue d\u2019origine, veuillez contacter le Greffe. La d\u00e9cision sera publi\u00e9e dans les deux langues officielles une fois la traduction termin\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la Loi sur les langues officielles.\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 :\nLe Tribunal a conclu que les coll\u00e8gues de M. Abadi chez TST Overland Express (TST), une entreprise de camionnage, l\u2019ont harcel\u00e9 pendant quatorze ans. Le Tribunal a aussi conclu que TST a fait preuve de discrimination envers M. Abadi en raison de sa d\u00e9ficience lorsqu\u2019elle a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi.\n\u00c0 partir de 2006, des coll\u00e8gues se sont moqu\u00e9s de l\u2019accent et des origines de M. Abadi et du fait qu\u2019il a immigr\u00e9 au Canada. En 2009 ou 2010, le r\u00e9partiteur de l\u2019entreprise a accroch\u00e9 des affiches sur un babillard du lieu de travail. Les affiches montraient des photos d\u2019entreprise de M. Abadi ou des dessins le concernant sur lesquelles il y avait des commentaires discriminatoires. Il se faisait traiter de noms d\u00e9gradants par des gens au travail. Les gens lui disaient que les personnes figurant dans les reportages sur le terrorisme \u00e9taient ses cousins et qu\u2019un ancien dirigeant libyen \u00e9tait son oncle. Ils ont insinu\u00e9 que, lorsqu\u2019il rendait visite \u00e0 sa famille, il pouvait se rendre dans un camp terroriste et devenir un terroriste. Environ 85 % des chauffeurs de TST l\u2019ont trait\u00e9 de noms d\u00e9gradants. Cette situation s\u2019est poursuivie jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que TST mette fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Abadi.\nLe comportement de ces personnes \u00e9tait importun, s\u2019est produit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises et \u00e9tait li\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re r\u00e9elle ou apparente, \u00e0 la race, \u00e0 l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique et \u00e0 la religion. TST ne disposait pas d\u2019une politique efficace en mati\u00e8re de harc\u00e8lement. L\u2019\u00e9quipe de gestion de TST sur les lieux \u00e9tait au courant du harc\u00e8lement, n\u2019a rien fait pour y mettre fin et l\u2019a tol\u00e9r\u00e9. TST n\u2019a pas pris les mesures n\u00e9cessaires pour pr\u00e9venir, att\u00e9nuer ou \u00e9viter les effets du harc\u00e8lement. Le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 les arguments de TST selon lesquels le harc\u00e8lement s\u2019\u00e9tait produit il y a si longtemps qu\u2019il serait injuste que le Tribunal se prononce \u00e0 ce sujet.\nEn 2019, TST a mis fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Abadi parce qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas revenu \u00e0 temps de ses vacances. Le handicap physique que M. Abadi avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 pendant ses vacances \u00e9tait une d\u00e9ficience qui l\u2019avait emp\u00each\u00e9 de revenir au travail \u00e0 temps. Dans un premier temps, M. Abadi a dit \u00e0 TST qu\u2019aucun vol n\u2019\u00e9tait disponible. Quand TST a inform\u00e9 M. Abadi qu\u2019il devait reprendre le travail dans les trois jours, M. Abadi a envoy\u00e9 des photos montrant son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. L\u2019explication donn\u00e9e par M. Abadi pour justifier le fait qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas communiqu\u00e9 plus t\u00f4t les d\u00e9tails de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 \u00e9tait concevable, compte tenu du harc\u00e8lement qu\u2019il a subi. La d\u00e9ficience a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de TST de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Abadi.\nTST n\u2019a pas \u00e9tabli de moyens de d\u00e9fense. M. Abadi avait demand\u00e9 deux semaines de cong\u00e9 sans solde afin d\u2019obtenir l\u2019autorisation m\u00e9dicale de prendre l\u2019avion pour rentrer chez lui. TST n\u2019a \u00e9tabli aucune exigence professionnelle justifi\u00e9e qui aurait emp\u00each\u00e9 cet accommodement. L\u2019information envoy\u00e9e par M. Abadi \u00e9tait suffisante pour informer TST qu\u2019il avait un probl\u00e8me de sant\u00e9. TST n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 plus de renseignements m\u00e9dicaux au moment de prendre la d\u00e9cision de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Abadi. Rien ne prouve qu\u2019en acceptant la demande de M. Abadi, TST aurait subi une contrainte excessive. La cessation d\u2019emploi de M. Abadi par TST a \u00e9t\u00e9 une pratique discriminatoire.\nContrairement \u00e0 la conclusion sur la d\u00e9ficience, le Tribunal a jug\u00e9 que la race, l\u2019origine et la religion, r\u00e9elles ou per\u00e7ues, n\u2019avaient pas jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans la d\u00e9cision de TST de mettre fin \u00e0 l\u2019emploi de M. Abadi.\nM. Abadi a occup\u00e9 d\u2019autres emplois apr\u00e8s avoir travaill\u00e9 chez TST, mais ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas comparables \u00e0 son emploi chez TST. Au cours d\u2019un voyage de six mois pour rendre visite \u00e0 sa famille, M. Abadi n\u2019a pas fait d\u2019efforts raisonnables pour trouver un emploi comparable. Ce voyage a bris\u00e9 le lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la discrimination et sa perte de revenu. Le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 le versement d\u2019une somme de 44 731 $ pour salaire perdu. Il a aussi demand\u00e9 aux parties de calculer le montant des cong\u00e9s annuels et des cotisations au r\u00e9gime de retraite pour les mois \u00e9coul\u00e9s entre la fin de son emploi et son voyage de six mois. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement accord\u00e9 17 000 $ pour pr\u00e9judice moral, 12 000 $ pour l\u2019insouciance de TST et des int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 compter de la date de cessation d\u2019emploi.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nIl n'y a pas de document disponible pour cette d\u00e9cision.",

La plaignante avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 seulement le Service correctionnel du Canada (SCC) comme intim\u00e9. Elle a voulu ajouter le psychiatre engag\u00e9 par le SCC qui avait fait l'\u00e9valuation de la dysphorie de genre. Les actions du psychiatre sont au c\u0153ur de la plainte. La possibilit\u00e9 de le nommer comme intim\u00e9 \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part. De plus, il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas n\u00e9cessaire de l\u2019ajouter comme intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade. Enfin, un tel ajout contournerait la fonction de contr\u00f4le essentielle qui est exerc\u00e9e par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.

APER\u00c7U\n[1] La plaignante sollicite une ordonnance afin d\u2019ajouter un tiers, le Dr Stephen John Charman Hucker, \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00e0 sa plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Dans sa plainte, la plaignante affirme qu\u2019elle est une femme transgenre autochtone sous la garde de Service correctionnel du Canada (\u00ab SCC \u00bb). Elle soutient que la pratique appliqu\u00e9e par SCC pour d\u00e9terminer si les d\u00e9tenus de diverses identit\u00e9s de genre ont acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des soins d\u2019affirmation de genre est discriminatoire et que, plus particuli\u00e8rement, le Dr Hucker, psychiatre l\u00e9giste embauch\u00e9 par SCC, a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son secret \u00e0 sa famille et \u00e0 sa communaut\u00e9 d\u2019origine sans son consentement. Elle affirme que ces actes constituent une discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 ou l\u2019expression de genre.\n[2] Dans sa plainte, elle n\u2019a nomm\u00e9 que SCC comme intim\u00e9.\nII. D\u00c9CISION\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je rejette la demande.\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE\n[4] Devrais-je exercer mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et permettre \u00e0 la plaignante d\u2019ajouter le Dr Hucker comme intim\u00e9?\nIV. CONTEXTE\n[5] La plaignante est d\u00e9tenue dans un \u00e9tablissement exploit\u00e9 par SCC. Dans la plainte, elle soutient que SCC a engag\u00e9 le Dr Hucker pour qu\u2019il \u00e9value sa dysphorie de genre. Le Dr Hucker l\u2019a donc rencontr\u00e9e le 6 juillet 2018 et a rendu un rapport le 3 ao\u00fbt 2018. Or, apr\u00e8s la rencontre, le Dr Hucker a, dit-elle, divulgu\u00e9 des renseignements personnels sur son identit\u00e9 et son expression de genre \u00e0 des personnes de sa communaut\u00e9 d\u2019origine, r\u00e9v\u00e9lant ainsi son identit\u00e9, sans son consentement. Il a notamment demand\u00e9 l\u2019avis de l\u2019ex-\u00e9pouse de la plaignante.\n[6] La plainte est ax\u00e9e presque enti\u00e8rement sur les actes du Dr Hucker. La plaignante soutient qu\u2019il s\u2019est appuy\u00e9 sur l\u2019opinion de son ex-\u00e9pouse et sur le fait qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son genre plus t\u00f4t pour conclure qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas une femme transgenre. Elle ajoute que le Dr Hucker l\u2019a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment m\u00e9genr\u00e9e \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises dans son rapport. Par ailleurs, il a finalement recommand\u00e9 qu\u2019on ne lui offre pas d\u2019hormones f\u00e9minisantes et qu\u2019elle abandonne sa [traduction] \u00ab strat\u00e9gie \u00bb de transformation sexuelle.\n[7] Dans sa plainte, la plaignante soutient que la conduite du Dr Hucker \u00e0 son \u00e9gard constituait un acte de discrimination et de harc\u00e8lement d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 fond\u00e9 sur l\u2019identit\u00e9 et l\u2019expression de genre. Elle pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 son secret \u00e0 des personnes de sa petite communaut\u00e9, qu\u2019il l\u2019a priv\u00e9e du droit de d\u00e9terminer elle-m\u00eame son identit\u00e9 de genre et l\u2019a accus\u00e9e de falsifier son identit\u00e9 de genre sur la base de pr\u00e9somptions st\u00e9r\u00e9otyp\u00e9es et discriminatoires.\n[8] La plainte compte trois pages. Les all\u00e9gations de la plaignante concernant la responsabilit\u00e9 de SCC sont expos\u00e9es au dernier paragraphe de la partie intitul\u00e9e [traduction] \u00ab R\u00e9sum\u00e9 et d\u00e9tails de la discrimination en cause \u00bb, qui fait deux pages. La plaignante affirme que SCC contr\u00f4le l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux soins de sant\u00e9 et soutient qu\u2019il a l\u2019obligation de veiller \u00e0 ce que les professionnels qu\u2019il embauche adh\u00e8rent \u00e0 ses politiques et respectent ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne. Comme SCC a retenu les services du Dr Hucker, il est responsable des actes discriminatoires commis par ce dernier et d\u2019avoir ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 la discrimination en d\u00e9fendant le rapport du Dr Hucker et en refusant de payer une nouvelle \u00e9valuation. \u00c0 la derni\u00e8re page de son formulaire de plainte, la plaignante d\u00e9crit en d\u00e9tail les cons\u00e9quences qu\u2019a eues pour elle l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 et les mesures qu\u2019elle a prises pour y faire face.\n[9] L\u2019avocat de la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) le 27 juin 2019. Selon le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission, qui est joint \u00e0 la plainte, l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 est le refus de service pour un motif de distinction illicite (art. 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, c. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb)).\n[10] Tant dans le formulaire de plainte sign\u00e9 que dans le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte, seul SCC est inscrit comme intim\u00e9.\n[11] La Commission a examin\u00e9 la plainte, le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate et les observations des parties et a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 le 15 juin 2022 de renvoyer la plainte au Tribunal pour instruction. Dans la lettre adress\u00e9e \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidente du Tribunal, l\u2019affaire est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e comme une plainte contre SCC.\n[12] Le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2022, l\u2019avocat de la plaignante a \u00e9crit au Tribunal et aux autres parties pour les informer que cette derni\u00e8re avait l\u2019intention de d\u00e9poser une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 et une autre requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019ajouter le Dr Hucker \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9. J\u2019ai demand\u00e9 que la requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 soit trait\u00e9e en premier et j\u2019ai rendu une d\u00e9cision le 3 avril 2023. Les parties et le Dr Hucker ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs observations sur la deuxi\u00e8me requ\u00eate entre le 21 avril et le 30 juin 2023.\n[13] La Commission appuie la demande de la plaignante, alors que SCC ne prend pas position. Le Dr Hucker s\u2019y oppose.\nV. ANALYSE\n[14] Nul ne conteste que le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019ajouter des parties \u00e0 une affaire. L\u2019article 29 des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137, \u00e9nonce la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour pr\u00e9senter cette demande, qui comprend l\u2019obligation d\u2019en aviser la partie \u00e9ventuelle et de lui donner la possibilit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des observations.\n[15] Dans la d\u00e9cision Peters c. United Parcel Service Canada Ltd., 2019 TCDP 15 (CanLII) [Peters], le Tribunal a expliqu\u00e9 comment il a trait\u00e9 ces demandes au fil des ans. Il a fait remarquer que, puisque l\u2019ajout d\u2019une partie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019instruction est susceptible de priver la partie de la possibilit\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 l\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable auquel la Commission proc\u00e8de en vertu des articles 41 et 44 de la Loi, le Tribunal s\u2019assure de tenir compte des divers risques et pr\u00e9judices qui peuvent en d\u00e9couler et de soupeser les divers facteurs (aux par. 39 et 40).\n[16] Dans la d\u00e9cision Syndicat des employ\u00e9s d\u2019ex\u00e9cution de Qu\u00e9bec-t\u00e9l\u00e9phone section locale 5044 du SCFP c. Telus communications (Qu\u00e9bec) inc., 2003 TCDP 31, aux paragraphes 30, 36 [Telus], le Tribunal a conclu que l\u2019ajout d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 est appropri\u00e9 s\u2019il est \u00e9tabli :\nque la pr\u00e9sence de cette nouvelle partie est n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte;\nqu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible une fois la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission que l\u2019adjonction d\u2019un nouvel intim\u00e9 serait n\u00e9cessaire pour disposer de la plainte;\nque l\u2019ajout d\u2019une nouvelle partie ne causera pas de pr\u00e9judice grave \u00e0 cette partie.\n[17] Dans la d\u00e9cision Peters, le Tribunal a soulign\u00e9 avoir toujours tenu compte des deux premiers crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Telus pour d\u00e9terminer si une partie devait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9e \u00e0 une proc\u00e9dure. Toutefois, il a \u00e9galement expliqu\u00e9 que, dans la d\u00e9cision Telus, il n\u2019avait pas cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00e9tablir une liste exhaustive de facteurs \u00e0 analyser (par. 44), d\u2019autant plus qu\u2019il est tenu par la loi d\u2019instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique (par. 48.9(1) de la Loi).\n[18] Par cons\u00e9quent, dans la d\u00e9cision Peters, le Tribunal a conclu que, selon les faits de l\u2019affaire, une analyse des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Telus n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u00e9terminante. Le Tribunal a d\u00fb tenir compte de facteurs autres que ceux \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans Telus.\n[19] Selon la plaignante, comme l\u2019application rigide du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Telus suscite des inqui\u00e9tudes, je devrais aller au-del\u00e0 de ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu dans la d\u00e9cision Peters et cesser d\u2019utiliser ce crit\u00e8re comme cadre d\u2019analyse. Son avocat a donc propos\u00e9 un nouveau crit\u00e8re \u00e0 deux volets. La Commission souscrit \u00e0 cette proposition et sugg\u00e8re de formuler le crit\u00e8re en termes clairs :\nSerait-il dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public d\u2019ajouter l\u2019intim\u00e9 propos\u00e9?\nL\u2019avantage d\u2019ajouter l\u2019intim\u00e9 propos\u00e9 l\u2019emporte-t-il sur le pr\u00e9judice potentiel caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 propos\u00e9?\n[20] La plaignante a ensuite pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dix facteurs \u00e0 prendre en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019application de ce crit\u00e8re.\n[21] Je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019il faille enti\u00e8rement reformuler le crit\u00e8re et dresser une liste d\u2019au moins dix facteurs. Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a fait remarquer dans la d\u00e9cision Peters, le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Telus repose sur des facteurs utiles et d\u2019autres facteurs peuvent venir s\u2019y ajouter, selon les faits d\u2019une affaire donn\u00e9e. Il ne serait pas plus utile de cr\u00e9er un nouveau crit\u00e8re et de dresser une longue liste de facteurs. \u00c0 mon avis, les deux consid\u00e9rations g\u00e9n\u00e9rales qui ressortent de la proposition de la Commission (int\u00e9r\u00eat public et pr\u00e9judice) sont bien prises en consid\u00e9ration dans l\u2019examen des demandes d\u2019adjonction, que ce soit en appliquant simplement le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Telus ou en tenant compte d\u2019autres facteurs pertinents.\n[22] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019analyserai la demande de la plaignante en tenant compte des crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Telus et d\u2019autres facteurs pertinents, que ce soit des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans la d\u00e9cision Peters ou dans les observations des parties.\nA. Il \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible que le Dr Hucker soit nomm\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9\n[23] \u00c0 mon avis, le facteur le plus important \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer dans les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire est le deuxi\u00e8me facteur \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Telus, soit la pr\u00e9visibilit\u00e9 raisonnable. Non seulement la plaignante \u00e9tait au courant du r\u00f4le jou\u00e9 par le Dr Hucker dans les faits soulev\u00e9s dans sa plainte, mais son argumentation se rapporte presque enti\u00e8rement \u00e0 lui et \u00e0 ses pratiques discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9es. Jusqu\u2019au dernier paragraphe, la plainte porte essentiellement sur lui, et la plaignante maintient dans sa requ\u00eate que les all\u00e9gations qu\u2019elle a formul\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du Dr Hucker ne sont ni frivoles ni sp\u00e9culatives.\n[24] Pourtant, la plainte n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e que contre SCC. Bien souvent, les plaignants d\u00e9posent des plaintes contre les organismes qui seraient responsables du fait d\u2019autrui en raison de la conduite adopt\u00e9e par un auteur d\u2019actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles, et ce, pour diverses raisons, ne serait-ce que parce que ces organismes ont les moyens ou sont les mieux plac\u00e9s pour fournir la r\u00e9paration appropri\u00e9e, comme la mise en \u0153uvre de mesures de r\u00e9paration d\u2019ordre syst\u00e9mique.\n[25] Selon la Commission et la plaignante, la plaignante ne devrait pas se voir priv\u00e9e de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019adjoindre le Dr Hucker comme partie simplement parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible qu\u2019il serait n\u00e9cessaire de faire participer ce dernier \u00e0 l\u2019instance pour disposer de la plainte. \u00c0 leur avis, il vaut mieux accueillir la demande d\u2019adjonction que de demander \u00e0 la plaignante de d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte contre le Dr Hucker et de demander \u00e0 la Commission d\u2019exercer le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire que lui conf\u00e8re l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) de la Loi d\u2019accepter la plainte m\u00eame si le d\u00e9lai est expir\u00e9. Le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019une nouvelle plainte serait inefficace et irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019obligation de proc\u00e9der sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des exigences de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique qui est pr\u00e9vue au paragraphe 48.9(1).\n[26] L\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) pr\u00e9voit que la Commission n\u2019est pas tenue de statuer sur une plainte si elle est fond\u00e9e sur des faits survenus plus d\u2019un an avant la r\u00e9ception de la plainte, ou plus si la Commission l\u2019estime appropri\u00e9. En d\u2019autres termes, la Commission a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de d\u00e9cider si elle doit traiter une plainte concernant des faits survenus plus d\u2019un an auparavant. Les autres dispositions du paragraphe 41(1) exposent d\u2019autres raisons pour lesquelles la Commission peut d\u00e9cider de ne pas traiter une plainte (c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire si elle n\u2019est pas de sa comp\u00e9tence, si elle est frivole, vexatoire ou entach\u00e9e de mauvaise foi, si elle peut \u00eatre avantageusement instruite en vertu d\u2019une autre loi et si le plaignant doit d\u2019abord \u00e9puiser d\u2019autres recours).\n[27] L\u2019argument de la Commission et de la plaignante est troublant. Comment la Commission peut-elle pr\u00e9supposer la fa\u00e7on dont elle \u00e9valuerait une plainte correctement formul\u00e9e contre le Dr Hucker? Nous ne savons pas si elle d\u00e9ciderait d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour instruire la plainte au-del\u00e0 de la p\u00e9riode d\u2019un an pr\u00e9vue \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e) alors que plus de trois ans se sont \u00e9coul\u00e9s depuis l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9. Nous ne savons pas comment la Commission r\u00e9pondrait \u00e0 toute autre objection ou observation du Dr Hucker dans l\u2019exercice du pouvoir que lui conf\u00e8re la Loi.\n[28] Selon la Commission et la plaignante, le Tribunal pourrait examiner les objections du Dr Hucker \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019audience, au m\u00eame titre qu\u2019il s\u2019est pench\u00e9 sur la question de l\u2019adjonction d\u2019un intim\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Peters.\n[29] Toutefois, le Tribunal ne peut pas exercer les pouvoirs qui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission, en particulier celui qui est conf\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019alin\u00e9a 41(1)e). Le Tribunal a maintes fois indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019en situation inverse, lorsque des intim\u00e9s demandent le rejet d\u2019une plainte au motif qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e apr\u00e8s l\u2019expiration du d\u00e9lai d\u2019un an, il doit respecter la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de la Commission de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il y a lieu de traiter une telle plainte, \u00e0 moins que la preuve ne d\u00e9montre qu\u2019il est devenu impossible de tenir une audience \u00e9quitable vu le trop grand d\u00e9lai (voir Pequeneza c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2016 TCDP 21).\n[30] Le probl\u00e8me est particuli\u00e8rement grave en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Le Tribunal ne peut pas usurper la comp\u00e9tence exclusive de la Commission de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient de traiter une plainte qui est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le Dr Hucker plus de trois ans apr\u00e8s les faits all\u00e9gu\u00e9s, m\u00eame si la plaignante savait d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but qu\u2019elle pouvait d\u00e9poser des plaintes contre lui. En vertu de la Loi, il revient \u00e0 la Commission de d\u00e9cider si la plainte doit \u00eatre accept\u00e9e et instruite, et non au Tribunal.\n[31] La Commission a \u00e9voqu\u00e9 la r\u00e8gle g\u00e9n\u00e9rale selon laquelle les questions qui d\u00e9coulent d\u2019un m\u00eame ensemble de circonstances factuelles devraient normalement \u00eatre entendues ensemble, ce qui rehausse l\u2019efficience de la proc\u00e9dure et pr\u00e9vient la possibilit\u00e9 de d\u00e9cisions incompatibles. Toutefois, cette r\u00e8gle sert habituellement \u00e0 joindre plusieurs proc\u00e9dures dont l\u2019instance d\u00e9cisionnelle est d\u00fbment saisie. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je ne suis saisi que d\u2019une seule plainte, d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre une partie intim\u00e9e, \u00e0 savoir SCC.\n[32] Je note \u00e9galement que la plaignante n\u2019a pas expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas d\u00e9sign\u00e9 le Dr Hucker comme intim\u00e9 alors que quasiment toute sa plainte se rapportait \u00e0 lui. En revanche, dans la d\u00e9cision Peters, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la plaignante avait toujours eu l\u2019intention de d\u00e9signer l\u2019autre partie comme intim\u00e9e, mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas pu le faire en raison d\u2019un probl\u00e8me technique avec le site Web de la Commission. Dans cette affaire, la Commission a reconnu dans ses observations qu\u2019une erreur avait peut-\u00eatre \u00e9t\u00e9 commise dans le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte.\n[33] De m\u00eame, dans la d\u00e9cision Leonard c. Canadian American Transportation Inc., 2022 TCDP 20, le plaignant avait d\u00e9sign\u00e9 la partie additionnelle propos\u00e9e comme partie intim\u00e9e dans la plainte initiale, mais, pour une raison ou une autre, la Commission a retir\u00e9 le nom de cette partie sans donner de pr\u00e9avis ou de motifs au plaignant.\n[34] Rien n\u2019indique qu\u2019une erreur similaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commise ou qu\u2019il y a une autre explication pour justifier le fait que le Dr Hucker n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[35] Dans la d\u00e9cision Peters, la Commission a \u00e9galement indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas pu communiquer avec l\u2019autre partie dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate et que cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019avait pas pu \u00eatre interrog\u00e9e, ce qui pouvait expliquer pourquoi elle n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme intim\u00e9e dans la plainte qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. En revanche, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la Commission avait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement communiqu\u00e9 avec le Dr Hucker. Selon l\u2019expos\u00e9 des faits de la plaignante, l\u2019agent des droits de la personne de la Commission s\u2019est entretenu directement avec le Dr Hucker. La plaignante soutient que le Dr Hucker a particip\u00e9 activement au processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission et que le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate pr\u00e9sentait la position du Dr Hucker.\n[36] Pourtant, personne n\u2019a expliqu\u00e9 pourquoi rien n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour ajouter le Dr Hucker \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 avant que la plainte ne soit renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction.\n[37] La plaignante soutient avoir fait part de son intention de demander l\u2019adjonction du Dr Hucker d\u00e8s qu\u2019elle en a eu l\u2019occasion, soit environ six mois apr\u00e8s que la plainte eut \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction, avant la date de d\u00e9p\u00f4t des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions, afin de r\u00e9duire au minimum le risque de pr\u00e9judice pour le Dr Hucker et SCC. Je ne suis pas du m\u00eame avis. Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une mauvaise interpr\u00e9tation des faits. La plainte portait presque exclusivement sur le Dr Hucker. La premi\u00e8re fois qu\u2019elle a eu l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9poser une plainte contre lui, c\u2019\u00e9tait en juin 2019, lorsqu\u2019elle a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission par l\u2019entremise de son avocat. Sa d\u00e9claration d\u2019intention, qu\u2019elle a faite le 13 d\u00e9cembre 2022, n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment la premi\u00e8re occasion qui s\u2019offrait \u00e0 elle.\n[38] Enfin, je suis pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 par les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019approche propos\u00e9e. Elle donne aux parties la possibilit\u00e9 de contourner l\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable auquel doit proc\u00e9der la Commission en vertu de la Loi. Au lieu de veiller \u00e0 organiser leur dossier et \u00e0 nommer tous les intim\u00e9s potentiels connus, ce qui permet alors aux intim\u00e9s de b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des protections proc\u00e9durales pr\u00e9vues par la Loi, les plaignants peuvent choisir d\u2019agir contre un seul intim\u00e9 et ne pas se soucier de faire un suivi aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un autre, sachant que le Tribunal pourra, des ann\u00e9es plus tard, rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 la situation. C\u2019est un mauvais message \u00e0 envoyer aux int\u00e9ress\u00e9s. Il faut pr\u00e9sumer que le l\u00e9gislateur a instaur\u00e9 une proc\u00e9dure de r\u00e9solution des plaintes dans la Loi pour une raison. Les parties ne devraient pas pouvoir l\u2019\u00e9carter facilement.\n[39] En somme, il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident, voire raisonnablement pr\u00e9visible, que le Dr Hucker allait devoir \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 au moment o\u00f9 la plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Voil\u00e0 qui milite fortement contre l\u2019accueil de toute demande visant \u00e0 ajouter le Dr Hucker comme intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade, bien plus de trois ans plus tard.\nB. L\u2019adjonction du Dr Hucker comme partie \u00e0 l\u2019instance n\u2019est pas \u00ab n\u00e9cessaire \u00bb.\n[40] La plaignante et la Commission soutiennent que le Dr Hucker doit \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9 parce que sa conduite est au c\u0153ur de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Il a eu directement connaissance des interactions qui ont eu lieu avec la plaignante et des tiers et il conna\u00eet les raisons qui l\u2019ont amen\u00e9 \u00e0 adopter les positions expos\u00e9es dans son rapport. Il est aussi possible qu\u2019il d\u00e9tienne des documents potentiellement pertinents qui ne sont pas en la possession, sous le contr\u00f4le ou sous la garde de SCC. Il peut r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations de fa\u00e7on plus appropri\u00e9e que SCC et peut avoir un point de vue diff\u00e9rent sur la question de savoir si SCC a agi avec diligence raisonnable en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce; par exemple sur la question de savoir si les politiques de SCC lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 correctement communiqu\u00e9es.\n[41] Toutefois, il est possible d\u2019obtenir ces renseignements sans faire de lui un intim\u00e9, notamment en l\u2019obligeant \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019assigner et de contraindre des t\u00e9moins \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e0 produire les pi\u00e8ces qu\u2019il juge indispensables \u00e0 l\u2019examen complet de la plainte (alin\u00e9a 50(3)a) de la Loi).\n[42] La Commission et la plaignante reconnaissent qu\u2019il est possible d\u2019obtenir les renseignements de cette fa\u00e7on, mais soutiennent que le processus serait [traduction] \u00ab plus efficace \u00bb si les documents \u00e9taient r\u00e9pertori\u00e9s et communiqu\u00e9s plus t\u00f4t, soit dans le cadre de la gestion de l\u2019instance, de sorte qu\u2019elles puissent prendre connaissance plus rapidement de la position du Dr Hucker sur ces questions. Cet argument ne peut \u00eatre retenu. Ce n\u2019est pas parce que la plaignante et la Commission pourraient pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments plus facilement et plus simplement que la participation du Dr Hucker est n\u00e9cessaire, surtout si l\u2019on tient compte du fait qu\u2019en l\u2019ajoutant comme partie \u00e0 ce stade, on le prive des protections proc\u00e9durales de la Loi.\nC. Les autres recours possibles contre le Dr Hucker ne sont pas un facteur\n[43] Aux termes du paragraphe 65(1) de la Loi, un organisme est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir commis tout acte ou omission commis par un employ\u00e9 ou un mandataire. Toutefois, l\u2019organisme peut se soustraire \u00e0 cette responsabilit\u00e9 du fait d\u2019autrui s\u2019il prouve qu\u2019il a rempli les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 65(2). La Commission soutient qu\u2019\u00e0 ce stade, comme SCC n\u2019a pas encore d\u00e9pos\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, nous ne savons pas si SCC a l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense au titre du paragraphe 65(2) de la Loi. Si SCC r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 se soustraire de la responsabilit\u00e9 des actes du Dr Hucker, la plaignante ne disposera plus d\u2019aucun recours.\n[44] Cet argument ne me convainc pas. Lorsqu\u2019une plainte est d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre un organisme en raison des actes ou omissions discriminatoires all\u00e9gu\u00e9s de ses employ\u00e9s ou mandataires, il est presque certain qu\u2019il tentera de se soustraire \u00e0 sa responsabilit\u00e9 en vertu du paragraphe 65(2). De ce fait, lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9pose sa plainte, le plaignant peut d\u00e9signer comme intim\u00e9 l\u2019employ\u00e9 ou le mandataire qui a commis l\u2019acte discriminatoire afin d\u2019avoir un recours contre lui.\n[45] Il peut arriver qu\u2019un plaignant ne connaisse pas l\u2019identit\u00e9 du mandataire ou de l\u2019employ\u00e9 lorsqu\u2019il d\u00e9pose sa plainte, mais qu\u2019il l\u2019apprenne plus tard, possiblement au cours du processus de divulgation. Il est alors compr\u00e9hensible que le plaignant demande \u00e0 ce qu\u2019il soit ajout\u00e9 comme intim\u00e9.\n[46] Toutefois, en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, la plaignante et la Commission connaissaient l\u2019identit\u00e9 du Dr Hucker et savaient qu\u2019il \u00e9tait impliqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019acte discriminatoire all\u00e9gu\u00e9 d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part. En fait, la quasi-totalit\u00e9 de la plainte le concerne. Il n\u2019est pas raisonnable de soutenir que le Dr Hucker devrait \u00eatre ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9 bien plus de trois ans plus tard simplement parce que la plaignante s\u2019est soudainement rendu compte que SCC pourrait avoir gain de cause en invoquant le moyen de d\u00e9fense fond\u00e9 sur le paragraphe 65(2).\n[47] L\u2019argument ne peut \u00eatre retenu.\nD. Le fait que le Dr Hucker \u00e9tait au courant des all\u00e9gations depuis des ann\u00e9es n\u2019annule pas l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable\n[48] La plaignante souligne que le Dr Hucker a \u00e9t\u00e9 interrog\u00e9 par l\u2019agent des droits de la personne de la Commission et qu\u2019il a donc particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. De plus, le Dr Hucker a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9 des all\u00e9gations port\u00e9es contre lui d\u2019au moins deux autres fa\u00e7ons \u2013 \u00e0 savoir, dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure interne de r\u00e8glement des griefs de SCC et \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre lui \u00e0 l\u2019Ordre des m\u00e9decins et chirurgiens de l\u2019Ontario. Il est au courant des all\u00e9gations de la plaignante depuis au moins mai 2019. Il a donc eu amplement l\u2019occasion de pr\u00e9parer la preuve et sa r\u00e9ponse aux all\u00e9gations. La plaignante soutient que ce pr\u00e9judice est [traduction] \u00ab minime \u00bb et qu\u2019il ne l\u2019emporte pas sur le pr\u00e9judice que repr\u00e9sente le fait de l\u2019obliger \u00e0 d\u00e9poser une nouvelle plainte contre lui aupr\u00e8s de la Commission.\n[49] Cet argument minimise l\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable des plaintes pr\u00e9vu par la Loi. Les intim\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient de protections proc\u00e9durales qui ne devraient pas \u00eatre aussi facilement \u00e9cart\u00e9es, surtout en pareilles circonstances puisque l\u2019identit\u00e9 et le r\u00f4le de la partie additionnelle \u00e9taient clairs d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but et qu\u2019aucune raison n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e pour ne pas l\u2019avoir nomm\u00e9e comme partie intim\u00e9e d\u00e8s le d\u00e9part.\n[50] De plus, le Dr Hucker soutient que, bien qu\u2019il ait particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission, il n\u2019a pas eu l\u2019occasion de fournir une d\u00e9fense officielle ou enti\u00e8re aux all\u00e9gations de la plaignante. Il affirme qu\u2019il a pris part \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de bonne foi, sachant qu\u2019il ne serait pas nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9. De plus, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 clarifier, \u00e0 corriger ou \u00e0 d\u00e9fendre les conclusions tir\u00e9es par l\u2019agent des droits de la personne au sujet de sa conduite dans le rapport d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[51] La plaignante r\u00e9torque que la r\u00e9ponse de SCC au rapport laisse entendre que SCC a collabor\u00e9 \u00e9troitement avec le Dr Hucker, ce qui lui a permis de pr\u00e9senter une d\u00e9fense enti\u00e8re. Toutefois, cette observation contredit la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente observation de la plaignante selon laquelle l\u2019ajout du Dr Hucker est n\u00e9cessaire parce qu\u2019il risque d\u2019avoir un point de vue sur les faits et les questions qui diff\u00e8re de celui de SCC. C\u2019est en effet tout \u00e0 fait possible, et c\u2019est pourquoi il devrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier des m\u00eames protections proc\u00e9durales que SCC.\n[52] Je souligne que, dans une autre affaire o\u00f9 le Tribunal a exerc\u00e9 son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et a autoris\u00e9 l\u2019ajout d\u2019une autre partie (Harrison c. Premi\u00e8re Nation de Curve Lake, 2018 TCDP 7), une plainte distincte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre l\u2019intim\u00e9e propos\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 la m\u00eame question, et la Commission avait fait enqu\u00eate. Il n\u2019est pas clair si l\u2019autre plainte a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. Quoi qu\u2019il en soit, la partie a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de r\u00e9pondre aux all\u00e9gations \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e au cours du processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, aucune plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne n\u2019a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e contre le Dr Hucker personnellement. Il se serait peut-\u00eatre comport\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment et aurait r\u00e9agi autrement au rapport s\u2019il avait su que sa responsabilit\u00e9 personnelle \u00e9tait en jeu.\n[53] Le Dr Hucker souligne \u00e0 juste titre que le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission est une \u00e9tape d\u00e9finie et essentielle de l\u2019instance qui permet \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de s\u2019acquitter de sa fonction d\u2019examen pr\u00e9alable et qui conf\u00e8re aux intim\u00e9s le droit essentiel de contester les all\u00e9gations d\u00e8s le d\u00e9but. Sa collaboration \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la Commission ne peut \u00eatre interpr\u00e9t\u00e9e comme une participation significative \u00e0 ce processus, ce \u00e0 quoi aurait eu droit un intim\u00e9 d\u00e9sign\u00e9. Sa modeste participation, \u00e0 savoir l\u2019entretien qu\u2019il a eu avec l\u2019agent des droits de la personne et sa collaboration avec SCC, dont les int\u00e9r\u00eats n\u2019\u00e9taient pas n\u00e9cessairement les m\u00eames que les siens, n\u2019a pas eu pour effet de rem\u00e9dier au pr\u00e9judice qu\u2019il a subi en ne b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant pas des protections proc\u00e9durales\n[54] Pour toutes ces raisons, je conclus que la demande de la plaignante visant \u00e0 ajouter le Dr Hucker comme intim\u00e9 \u00e0 ce stade n\u2019est pas justifi\u00e9e. Je n\u2019exercerai pas mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire pour y faire droit.\nVI.

D\u00c9CISION SUR REQU\u00caTE [1] Le plaignant, Christopher Garnier, un d\u00e9tenu sous responsabilit\u00e9 f\u00e9d\u00e9rale incarc\u00e9r\u00e9 dans un \u00e9tablissement g\u00e9r\u00e9 par l\u2019intim\u00e9, Service correctionnel du Canada (\u00ab SCC \u00bb), soutient que SCC n\u2019a pas pris de mesures d\u2019adaptation li\u00e9es \u00e0 sa d\u00e9ficience, ce qui est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019article 5 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch. H-6. (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[2] SCC, qui nie avoir agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en vue de faire radier des parties de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Garnier, et plus particuli\u00e8rement les paragraphes 8 \u00e0 25, 28, 29, 30 et 32 \u00e0 40 (les \u00ab paragraphes \u00bb), au motif que des all\u00e9gations ne figurant pas dans la plainte que M. Garnier a initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e (la \u00ab plainte \u00bb) aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) y sont soulev\u00e9es.\n[3] M. Garnier s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et la Commission ne prend pas position.\n[4] Pour les motifs qui suivent, la requ\u00eate de SCC est accueillie et les paragraphes sont radi\u00e9s.\nII. CONTEXTE [5] M. Garnier soutient avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 victime de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la d\u00e9ficience de la part de SCC alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait d\u00e9tenu \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de l\u2019Atlantique situ\u00e9 \u00e0 Renous, au Nouveau-Brunswick, en violation de l\u2019article 5 de la LCDP. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, M. Garnier fait les all\u00e9gations suivantes dans la plainte qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en juin 2019 :\nSCC lui a refus\u00e9 l\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un traitement de sant\u00e9 mentale ad\u00e9quat pour le syndrome de stress post-traumatique (le \u00ab SSPT \u00bb) parce que, selon SCC, sa d\u00e9ficience n\u2019\u00e9tait pas un facteur criminog\u00e8ne; M. Garnier a re\u00e7u une aide psychologique lors de son admission dans un \u00e9tablissement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral en septembre 2018, et ce jusqu\u2019en avril 2019; or, les prestataires de soins de l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de l\u2019Atlantique n\u2019avaient pas [traduction] \u00ab les connaissances, les \u00e9tudes, la formation ou l\u2019expertise \u00bb n\u00e9cessaire pour traiter le SSPT.\n[6] Dans sa plainte, M. Garnier pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il n\u2019a [traduction] \u00ab rien \u00e0 reprocher au personnel et \u00e0 la direction de [l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de l\u2019Atlantique]. La plainte vise les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures sur lesquelles reposent les pratiques de l\u2019\u00c9tablissement \u00bb.\n[7] La Commission a joint le compte rendu de sa d\u00e9cision dat\u00e9 du 2 juin 2021 \u00e0 la lettre de renvoi qu\u2019elle a envoy\u00e9e au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb). Dans ce compte rendu, la Commission pr\u00e9cise qu\u2019il est [traduction] \u00ab express\u00e9ment all\u00e9gu\u00e9 [dans la plainte] que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a appliqu\u00e9 une ligne de conduite discriminatoire en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la prestation de services de traitement et de ressources de sant\u00e9 mentale aux d\u00e9tenus \u00bb.\n[8] Dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal en novembre 2022, M. Garnier r\u00e9p\u00e8te les all\u00e9gations faites dans sa plainte et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es ci-dessus. Dans les paragraphes vis\u00e9s par la requ\u00eate en radiation de SCC, il fait aussi les all\u00e9gations suivantes :\nEn juin 2022, M. Garnier a fait le trajet entre l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de l\u2019Atlantique et un h\u00f4pital local \u2014 o\u00f9 il devait subir une chirurgie au dos \u2014 \u00e0 bord d\u2019un v\u00e9hicule de SCC qui ne respectait pas les normes en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Apr\u00e8s avoir subi la chirurgie, il est retourn\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de l\u2019Atlantique et a re\u00e7u de la part de SCC des soins et des traitements postop\u00e9ratoires inad\u00e9quats qui lui ont caus\u00e9 des souffrances physiques et mentales. M. Garnier a d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une affection pulmonaire pendant son incarc\u00e9ration \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de l\u2019Atlantique et SCC lui a fourni des soins de sant\u00e9 et des traitements inad\u00e9quats qui lui ont caus\u00e9 des souffrances physiques et mentales.\nIII. ANALYSE [9] Le Tribunal doit s\u2019en tenir \u00e0 la plainte initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission et \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision que prend cette derni\u00e8re lorsqu\u2019elle lui renvoie la plainte pour instruction : Connors c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2019 TCDP 6, au par. 28.\n[10] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de modifier une plainte afin de d\u00e9terminer les v\u00e9ritables questions en litige entre les parties. Toutefois, une telle modification ne peut pas servir \u00e0 introduire fondamentalement une nouvelle plainte, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que cela aurait pour effet de contourner le processus de renvoi de la Commission pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP. Lorsque la modification propos\u00e9e ne s\u2019inscrit pas dans la port\u00e9e de la plainte renvoy\u00e9e par la Commission, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour l\u2019instruire : MacEachern c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2014 TCDP 4, aux par. 9 \u00e0 12.\n[11] De plus, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, le Tribunal n\u2019autorise pas une modification s\u2019il est manifeste et \u00e9vident que les all\u00e9gations faisant l\u2019objet de la demande de modification ne sauraient r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 prouver qu\u2019il y a eu discrimination : Saviye c. Afroglobal Network Inc. et Michael Daramola, 2016 TCDP 18, au par. 15.\n[12] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore c. Colombie-Britannique, 2012 CSC 61 (Moore), la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 les exigences \u00e0 respecter pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination. La Cour a conclu que les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils poss\u00e8dent une caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e contre la discrimination, qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 cette caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e et que la caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Une fois ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments prouv\u00e9s, il incombe alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de justifier sa conduite. Si la conduite est justifi\u00e9e, il n\u2019y a pas de discrimination.\n[13] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. Garnier soutient que m\u00eame si la plainte ne couvre que l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle SCC lui aurait administr\u00e9 un traitement inappropri\u00e9 pour son SSPT, le Tribunal ne devrait pas l\u2019emp\u00eacher d\u2019ajouter \u00e0 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle SCC lui aurait ensuite fourni des soins inappropri\u00e9s pour ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 physique. M. Garnier soutient que [traduction] \u00ab la sant\u00e9 mentale et la sant\u00e9 physique sont indiscutablement interreli\u00e9es \u00bb et cite \u00e0 cet effet l\u2019Organisation mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 et de l\u2019Association canadienne pour la sant\u00e9 mentale puisqu\u2019elles ont affirm\u00e9 que la sant\u00e9 mentale et la sant\u00e9 physique \u00e9taient \u00ab fondamentalement li\u00e9es \u00bb.\n[14] Nul ne conteste que la sant\u00e9 physique et la sant\u00e9 mentale peuvent \u00eatre li\u00e9es, mais cette question n\u2019est pas particuli\u00e8rement pertinente dans le cadre de l\u2019examen de la requ\u00eate en radiation d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par SCC.\n[15] Il doit y avoir un lien clair entre les modifications propos\u00e9es et la plainte ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate et d\u2019un renvoi devant le Tribunal par la Commission. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il n\u2019existe pas un tel lien.\n[16] L\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle SCC aurait administr\u00e9 un traitement inappropri\u00e9 pour le SSPT de M. Garnier (soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte) repose sur des faits et des moments tout \u00e0 fait diff\u00e9rents de ceux expos\u00e9s dans l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle SCC aurait amen\u00e9 M. Garnier dans un v\u00e9hicule inad\u00e9quat et aurait fourni des soins inappropri\u00e9s pour ses probl\u00e8mes physiques (soulev\u00e9e dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions).\n[17] En outre, en ce qui concerne la troisi\u00e8me exigence du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore, il n\u2019est pas all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9ficience mentale de M. Garnier, ou toute autre caract\u00e9ristique prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans le transport inad\u00e9quat qui lui aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9serv\u00e9 ou dans les soins que SCC lui aurait fournis pour traiter ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 physique. M. Garnier affirme que le mode de transport de SCC repr\u00e9sente un risque pour [traduction] \u00ab tous les d\u00e9tenus \u00bb (aucun motif de distinction illicite identifi\u00e9) et que SCC lui a donn\u00e9 l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre inf\u00e9rieur aux non-d\u00e9tenus (le statut d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration ne constitue pas un motif de distinction illicite pr\u00e9vu par la LCDP).\n[18] M\u00eame si M. Garnier a connu une exacerbation de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale en raison des mauvais traitements que lui aurait fournis SCC, l\u2019exacerbation \u00e0 elle seule est g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement insuffisante pour \u00e9tablir l\u2019existence d\u2019un traitement pr\u00e9judiciable ou d\u00e9favorable fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, comme il est exig\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Moore.\n[19] M. Garnier pr\u00e9sente des observations exhaustives sur le fait que SCC aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 au courant des pr\u00e9occupations d\u2019ordre juridique soulev\u00e9es par le Bureau de l\u2019enqu\u00eateur correctionnel (le \u00ab BEC \u00bb) \u00e0 propos de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e0 bord des v\u00e9hicules d\u2019escorte des d\u00e9tenus de SCC. Il cite des rapports du BEC faisant \u00e9tat de blessures caus\u00e9es par le transport n\u00e9gligent de d\u00e9tenus pour appuyer sa position selon laquelle SCC a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de diligence envers les d\u00e9tenus.\n[20] La s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du transport des d\u00e9tenus est sans aucun doute une question importante. Toutefois, l\u2019information contenue dans les rapports du BEC n\u2019est pas pertinente dans le cadre de la requ\u00eate en radiation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par SCC puisque la question du transport est sans rapport avec l\u2019objet de la plainte de M. Garnier, soit le traitement discriminatoire que lui aurait fourni SCC pour son SSPT.\n[21] Enfin, dans les observations que M. Garnier a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate en radiation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par SCC, il soul\u00e8ve la possibilit\u00e9 de repr\u00e9sailles pour justifier l\u2019\u00e9largissement de la port\u00e9e de la plainte. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il soutient qu\u2019il est possible que SCC ait fourni un transport ou des soins de sant\u00e9 inad\u00e9quats en guise de repr\u00e9sailles pour la plainte.\n[22] Cependant, dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, M. Garnier n\u2019all\u00e8gue pas que SCC lui a fourni un transport ou des soins inad\u00e9quats en guise de repr\u00e9sailles pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa plainte. De m\u00eame, il n\u2019y a aucune all\u00e9gation selon laquelle SCC a exerc\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sailles dans la plainte de M. Garnier ou dans le dossier de renvoi devant le Tribunal de la Commission.\n[23] Dans ces circonstances, il ne suffit pas que M. Garnier soul\u00e8ve une simple all\u00e9gation de repr\u00e9sailles, sans aucune pr\u00e9cision, dans un argument pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un lien entre des situations factuelles distinctes et sans rapport entre elles. Accepter une telle all\u00e9gation reviendrait \u00e0 cr\u00e9er une situation in\u00e9quitable sur le plan proc\u00e9dural \u2014 situation dans laquelle il serait permis de soulever dans l\u2019argumentation des all\u00e9gations qui ne sont pas autrement li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte initiale ou \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nIV. CONCLUSION [24] La requ\u00eate de SCC est accueillie. Les paragraphes sont radi\u00e9s de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M.

Mme Nipa est une Canadienne originaire du Bangladesh. Elle est tr\u00e8s instruite et a \u00e9tudi\u00e9 l\u2019anglais. Elle a un accent lorsqu\u2019elle parle l\u2019anglais, sa langue seconde.\nMme Nipa a postul\u00e9 pour un emploi de premier \u00e9chelon chez Transports Canada. Elle a pass\u00e9 deux entretiens. Le premier \u00e9tait un entretien officiel, le second ne l\u2019\u00e9tait pas.\nLe gouvernement du Canada est cens\u00e9 embaucher des employ\u00e9s en fonction du m\u00e9rite. Le gouvernement doit donc veiller \u00e0 embaucher des personnes selon les comp\u00e9tences et les aptitudes requises pour le poste. Le processus implique souvent des entretiens officiels not\u00e9s au moyen de bar\u00e8mes qui sont bas\u00e9s sur les qualifications essentielles. En pratique, si de nombreux candidats sont jug\u00e9s qualifi\u00e9s pour un poste, un second entretien a lieu. \u00c0 ce stade, les responsables tentent de d\u00e9terminer qui s\u2019adapterait le mieux au poste et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe.\nApr\u00e8s le second entretien, qui \u00e9tait informel, la note de Mme Nipa pour la communication orale est pass\u00e9e d\u2019une r\u00e9ussite \u00e0 un \u00e9chec. Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019un fait extr\u00eamement inhabituel. Mme Nipa pensait que c\u2019\u00e9tait \u00e0 cause de sa race et de son identit\u00e9 ethnique. Transports Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que c\u2019\u00e9tait parce qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas communiqu\u00e9 clairement.\nLe Tribunal a vivement critiqu\u00e9 la fa\u00e7on dont le processus d\u2019embauche a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9. Toutefois, il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 convaincu, vu la preuve disponible, que la note de Mme Nipa avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e en raison de sa race ou de son origine ethnique. La plainte a donc \u00e9t\u00e9 rejet\u00e9e.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2023 TCDP\n33\nDate : le\n16 ao\u00fbt 2023\nNum\u00e9ro du dossier :\nHR-DP-2811-22\nEntre :\nISHRAT NIPA\nla plaignante\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nTRANSPORTS CANADA\nl'intim\u00e9\nD\u00e9cision\nMembre :\nEdward P.

APER\u00c7U [1] La plaignante, Ishrat Nipa, est une citoyenne canadienne originaire du Bangladesh. Elle all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait preuve, \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et\/ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique en modifiant la note qu\u2019elle avait obtenue au terme d\u2019une entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite et en lui attribuant, au terme d\u2019une entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, un \u00e9chec, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 son \u00e9limination d\u2019un processus de s\u00e9lection, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[2] Le 9 janvier 2020, Mme Nipa a accept\u00e9 une invitation \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter une entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection no 19-EA-HRS-96729 de Transports Canada (le \u00ab processus de s\u00e9lection \u00bb), qui visait l\u2019embauche d\u2019agents subalternes de l\u2019AIPRP (acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information et protection des renseignements personnels) de groupe et de niveau PM-01 (le \u00ab poste en cause \u00bb).\n[3] Elle a d\u2019abord \u00e9t\u00e9 retenue pour faire partie d\u2019un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour le poste en cause apr\u00e8s avoir obtenu la note de passage \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite men\u00e9e le 20 janvier 2020 par deux gestionnaires chevronn\u00e9es. Elle a \u00e9galement fourni les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences professionnelles requises dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection, ainsi que tous les formulaires et renseignements demand\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[4] Lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, Mme Nipa a obtenu la note de passage pour tous les crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite \u00e9valu\u00e9s. Les deux gestionnaires qui l\u2019ont interview\u00e9e lui ont donn\u00e9 une note de 3 sur 5 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite [traduction] \u00ab capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral \u00bb, bien que l\u2019une des intervieweuses ait not\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait du mal \u00e0 comprendre Mme Nipa et que celle-ci ne s\u2019exprimait pas clairement.\n[5] Par la suite, le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2020, Mme Nipa a assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite \u00e0 laquelle elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 invit\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9. Cette entrevue a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par deux gestionnaires diff\u00e9rentes, qui ont d\u00e9clar\u00e9 avoir eu des difficult\u00e9s \u00e0 comprendre ce que disait Mme Nipa et qui ont fait part \u00e0 leur directrice de leurs pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 ses capacit\u00e9s en mati\u00e8re de compr\u00e9hension et de communication orales.\n[6] \u00c0 la suite de l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, la directrice a rencontr\u00e9 les gestionnaires qui ont men\u00e9 chacune des entrevues. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu, sur les conseils d\u2019un conseiller en ressources humaines consult\u00e9 par la directrice, que la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa au terme de l\u2019entrevue officielle pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite [traduction] \u00ab capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral \u00bb serait modifi\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle obtiendrait un \u00e9chec \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce crit\u00e8re, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 son \u00e9limination du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[7] L\u2019intim\u00e9 nie avoir fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa et soutient que la modification de sa note et son \u00e9limination du processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e9taient attribuables aux pr\u00e9occupations que les gestionnaires ayant men\u00e9 l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite avaient exprim\u00e9es au sujet de ses comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de communication orale lorsqu\u2019elles l\u2019ont interview\u00e9e. Les gestionnaires de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite avaient exprim\u00e9 des pr\u00e9occupations semblables. Par cons\u00e9quent, les gestionnaires ont conclu, sur l\u2019avis du conseiller en ressources humaines, que Mme Nipa ne pouvait se qualifier en fonction du m\u00e9rite, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 30 de la Loi sur l\u2019emploi dans la fonction publique (la \u00ab LEFP \u00bb).\n[8] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve produits \u00e0 l\u2019audience, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que, bien que la d\u00e9cision de modifier la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa et de l\u2019\u00e9liminer du processus de s\u00e9lection ait \u00e9t\u00e9 inhabituelle et blessante pour Mme Nipa, voire peut-\u00eatre entach\u00e9e d\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s et de vices de proc\u00e9dure, il n\u2019est pas possible de d\u00e9duire raisonnablement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que la d\u00e9cision \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e sur la race et\/ou l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique de Mme Nipa. Par cons\u00e9quent, le Tribunal conclut que la d\u00e9cision n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire au sens de la LCDP. La plainte de Mme Nipa est donc rejet\u00e9e.\nII. CONTEXTE [9] Les principaux faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire ne sont pas contest\u00e9s. Le d\u00e9saccord des parties porte sur les raisons qui ont motiv\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision de modifier la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019un des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels et de lui attribuer un \u00e9chec, ce qui a entra\u00een\u00e9 son \u00e9limination du processus de s\u00e9lection. La seule question en litige dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire est donc de savoir si l\u2019intim\u00e9 a fait preuve de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la race et\/ou l\u2019originale nationale ou ethnique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa en modifiant sa note et en l\u2019\u00e9liminant du processus de s\u00e9lection, en contravention de l\u2019article 7 de la LCDP.\n[10] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 sa demande en ligne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9e conforme aux crit\u00e8res de pr\u00e9s\u00e9lection, Mme Nipa a re\u00e7u de l\u2019intim\u00e9 une invitation \u00e0 une entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection pour le poste en cause, invitation qu\u2019elle a accept\u00e9e le 9 janvier 2020. L\u2019entrevue devait avoir lieu le lundi 20 janvier 2020 \u00e0 9 h au 330, rue Sparks, \u00e0 Ottawa. L\u2019intim\u00e9 avait annonc\u00e9 le processus de s\u00e9lection dans le but de cr\u00e9er un bassin de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour recruter des agents subalternes de l\u2019AIPRP dans son bureau de l\u2019AIPRP.\n[11] Le poste en cause \u00e9tait un poste administratif de d\u00e9butant dont les t\u00e2ches consistaient \u00e0 recevoir et \u00e0 traiter les demandes d\u2019AIPRP de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et n\u00e9cessitaient que le titulaire interagisse verbalement avec les demandeurs et les membres du personnel.\n[12] L\u2019invitation de l\u2019intim\u00e9 pr\u00e9cisait que l\u2019entrevue visait \u00e0 \u00e9valuer les six crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite suivants :\n[traduction]\n\u00b7No 1. Capacit\u00e9 de planifier et d\u2019organiser\n\u00b7No 2. Entregent\n\u00b7No 3. R\u00e9flexion analytique\n\u00b7No 4. Fiabilit\u00e9\n\u00b7No 5. Esprit d\u2019\u00e9quipe\n\u00b7No 6. Capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral\n[13] En outre, l\u2019invitation pr\u00e9cisait qu\u2019une v\u00e9rification des r\u00e9f\u00e9rences de Mme Nipa serait effectu\u00e9e si elle r\u00e9ussissait l\u2019entrevue et que Mme Nipa devait fournir ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences [traduction] \u00ab \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci \u00bb. Toujours selon l\u2019invitation, Mme Nipa devait aussi pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue une pi\u00e8ce d\u2019identit\u00e9 avec photo et une attestation d\u2019\u00e9tudes. L\u2019invitation ne pr\u00e9cisait pas qu\u2019elle devait fournir des formulaires d\u2019autorisation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 relatifs \u00e0 une nomination \u00e9ventuelle \u00e0 partir du bassin de candidats. Mme Nipa a fourni \u00e0 temps les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences, la pi\u00e8ce d\u2019identit\u00e9 avec photo, l\u2019attestation d\u2019\u00e9tudes et les formulaires d\u2019autorisation de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 demand\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[14] Ni l\u2019invitation ni les renseignements fournis aux candidats en vue de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite ne mentionnaient qu\u2019une entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite aurait lieu \u00e0 une date ult\u00e9rieure dans le cadre du processus de s\u00e9lection ou d\u2019\u00e9valuation. L\u2019invitation pr\u00e9cisait toutefois que la s\u00e9lection des candidats qualifi\u00e9s se fonderait sur les r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019ensemble du processus d\u2019\u00e9valuation.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 a \u00e9galement fourni des instructions concernant l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, qui pr\u00e9cisaient que les candidats auraient 30 minutes pour pr\u00e9parer leurs r\u00e9ponses, que l\u2019entrevue durerait 60 minutes et que seules les r\u00e9ponses fournies oralement aux membres du jury pendant l\u2019entrevue seraient \u00e9valu\u00e9es (toutes les notes prises pendant l\u2019\u00e9tape de la pr\u00e9paration devaient \u00eatre remises aux membres du jury, mais ne seraient pas prises en compte dans le cadre de l\u2019\u00e9valuation).\n[16] Pour chaque crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite, \u00e0 l\u2019exception du crit\u00e8re no 6, une situation ou un sc\u00e9nario hypoth\u00e9tique pr\u00e9cis \u00e9tait donn\u00e9 et accompagn\u00e9 de questions sur les mesures \u00e0 prendre ou le comportement \u00e0 adopter. Dans le cas du crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 6, il n\u2019y avait pas de sc\u00e9nario, de situation ou de question. L\u2019\u00e9valuation de ce crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite se fondait plut\u00f4t sur la capacit\u00e9 des candidats de communiquer efficacement leurs r\u00e9ponses aux questions relatives aux situations et aux sc\u00e9narios visant les cinq autres crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite.\n[17] Selon le guide de cotation de l\u2019entrevue, le candidat ou la candidate devait obtenir la note de passage pour chacun des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels \u00e9valu\u00e9s afin de r\u00e9ussir l\u2019\u00e9tape de l\u2019entrevue. Chaque crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite \u00e9tait not\u00e9 sur 5.\n[18] Mme Nipa a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite le 20 janvier 2020 et a pris des notes pendant la p\u00e9riode de pr\u00e9paration qui a pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 l\u2019entrevue.\n[19] Mme Betricia Abou-Hamad, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re tr\u00e8s franche et cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et Mme Angie Belsher ont men\u00e9 l\u2019entrevue officielle. Toutes deux ont donn\u00e9 \u00e0 Mme Nipa exactement les m\u00eames notes pour chacun des six crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite lors de l\u2019entrevue du 20 janvier 2020 : 3 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 1; 3 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 2; 4 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 3; 3 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 4; 4 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 5, et 3 pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 6 (capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral). Par cons\u00e9quent, Mme Nipa a r\u00e9ussi l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite.\n[20] Sur le formulaire d\u2019\u00e9valuation se rapportant \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue, Mme Abou-Hamad, qui a beaucoup d\u2019exp\u00e9rience dans les processus de s\u00e9lection et a men\u00e9 de nombreuses entrevues, a formul\u00e9 les commentaires suivants. Pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 1, elle a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Ses id\u00e9es \u00e9taient \u00e9parpill\u00e9es, mais ont abord\u00e9 certains points \u00bb. Pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 2, elle a \u00e9crit : [traduction] \u00ab Ses id\u00e9es \u00e9taient \u00e9parpill\u00e9es, mais ont abord\u00e9 les points essentiels \u00bb.

Mme Abou-Hamad a admis que l\u2019entrevue non officielle avait eu lieu parce qu\u2019il y avait trop de candidats qualifi\u00e9s pour le nombre de postes disponibles et que, si l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite n\u2019avait pas eu lieu, la note n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e.\n[30] Mme Abou-Hamad a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de la grande diversit\u00e9 de l\u2019effectif au bureau de l\u2019AIPRP et au Minist\u00e8re et a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait suivi des cours sur la diversit\u00e9 et la discrimination inconsciente.

L\u2019objectif n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019\u00e9valuer le m\u00e9rite des candidats, puisque cette \u00e9valuation avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu lieu lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a expliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission, dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate sur la plainte, que l\u2019objectif \u00e9tait de trouver les personnes [traduction] \u00ab qui s\u2019int\u00e9greraient le mieux \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe en termes d\u2019\u00e9nergie et de capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre aux besoins pr\u00e9cis du minist\u00e8re [c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire] les personnes qui, de par leur \u00e9nergie et leur personnalit\u00e9, s\u2019int\u00e9greraient le plus facilement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quipe \u00bb.\n[33] L\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite de Mme Nipa, qui s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2020, a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e par Mme Marie-Jos\u00e9e Ouellette et Mme Jos\u00e9e Laurin, qui ne connaissaient pas Mme Nipa avant l\u2019entrevue et ignoraient sa race ou son origine ethnique. Mme Ouellette occupe un poste de rang sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de Mme Laurin, qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Mme Laurin avait \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e \u00e0 participer \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue non officielle \u00e0 la derni\u00e8re minute, en remplacement de quelqu\u2019un d\u2019autre. Elle n\u2019avait aucune exp\u00e9rience pr\u00e9alable de ce type d\u2019entrevue.\n[34] Mme Laurin, qui a elle aussi livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage franc et cr\u00e9dible, a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait essentiellement jou\u00e9 le r\u00f4le d\u2019observatrice et n\u2019avait pas vraiment particip\u00e9 activement \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite. Elle se souvenait uniquement d\u2019avoir pos\u00e9 deux questions \u00e0 Mme Nipa. L\u2019une de ces questions \u00e9tait de savoir si Mme Nipa \u00e9tait bilingue, parce qu\u2019elle avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 la comprendre et \u00e0 comprendre le fil de son raisonnement et qu\u2019elle avait l\u2019impression que Mme Nipa avait de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 exprimer ses id\u00e9es en anglais en r\u00e9ponse aux questions. Mme Nipa a r\u00e9pondu que l\u2019anglais \u00e9tait sa langue seconde et qu\u2019elle ne parlait pas le fran\u00e7ais.\n[35] L\u2019autre question que Mme Laurin a pos\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa lors de l\u2019entrevue \u00e9tait de savoir quand elle pourrait commencer \u00e0 travailler si un emploi lui \u00e9tait offert. Mme Laurin a indiqu\u00e9 que Mme Nipa avait d\u2019abord eu du mal \u00e0 r\u00e9pondre clairement \u00e0 la question et avait dit qu\u2019elle avait deux emplois \u00e0 temps partiel, mais qu\u2019elle avait finalement pu r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question en indiquant qu\u2019elle aurait besoin de donner un pr\u00e9avis d\u2019une semaine \u00e0 ses employeurs. Une note partiellement caviard\u00e9e de cet \u00e9change a \u00e9t\u00e9 produite en preuve. Il s\u2019agit de la seule note prise par les intervieweuses au cours de l\u2019entrevue non officielle, qui a dur\u00e9 environ une demi-heure.\n[36] En outre, Mme Laurin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience que, compte tenu du temps \u00e9coul\u00e9 depuis l\u2019entrevue, elle ne se souvenait pas d\u2019exemples pr\u00e9cis pour justifier son affirmation selon laquelle Mme Nipa \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 comprendre et que son raisonnement \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 suivre. Mme Laurin et Mme Abou-Hamad \u00e9taient les seuls t\u00e9moins \u00e0 l\u2019audience qui avaient rencontr\u00e9 Mme Nipa ou lui avaient parl\u00e9.\n[37] Mme Laurin a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que l\u2019entrevue non officielle avait pour but de trouver, parmi les candidats ayant r\u00e9ussi l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, ceux qui convenaient le mieux sur le plan op\u00e9rationnel au poste en cause. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que les entrevues non officielles n\u2019avaient eu lieu qu\u2019avec certains des candidats qui avaient r\u00e9ussi l\u2019entrevue, et qu\u2019elles n\u2019auraient pas eu lieu du tout s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu plus de candidats ayant r\u00e9ussi l\u2019entrevue que de postes disponibles.\n[38] Mme Laurin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision de modifier la note fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa, ni aux discussions entourant cette d\u00e9cision, et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait fait que rapporter \u00e0 Mme Parent les faits observ\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue. Elle n\u2019a appris que la note de Mme Nipa avait \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e et qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus de s\u00e9lection que quelque temps plus tard, apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire et l\u2019ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne.\n[39] Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite de Mme Nipa, qui a eu lieu le 20 f\u00e9vrier 2020, Mme Ouellette et Mme Laurin ont fait part \u00e0 Mme Parent de leurs pr\u00e9occupations quant \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de Mme Nipa de communiquer efficacement. Mme Parent, une gestionnaire chevronn\u00e9e qui a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on franche et cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 l\u2019audience, avait le pouvoir d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9 de prendre les d\u00e9cisions finales en mati\u00e8re d\u2019embauche puisqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait responsable de la gestion du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[40] En outre, Mme Genevi\u00e8ve St-Louis, une adjointe administrative qui n\u2019a pas interview\u00e9 Mme Nipa, mais qui l\u2019a accompagn\u00e9e aux deux entrevues, a dit \u00e0 Mme Parent qu\u2019elle avait eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre Mme Nipa et \u00e0 communiquer avec elle.\n[41] Le m\u00eame jour que l\u2019entrevue non officielle, Mme Parent a discut\u00e9 avec les quatre gestionnaires qui avaient interview\u00e9 Mme Nipa \u00e0 titre officiel et non officiel, y compris Mme Abou-Hamad et Mme Belsher, qui lui avaient accord\u00e9 la note de passage lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, bien qu\u2019elles aient eu quelques pr\u00e9occupations \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es par Mme Nipa. Selon Mme Parent, Mme Abou-Hamad et Mme Belsher lui ont dit que, bien qu\u2019elles aient eu un peu de difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre Mme Nipa, elles l\u2019avaient suffisamment bien comprise pour lui accorder la note de passage lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite.\n[42] \u00c0 l\u2019audience, Mme Parent a dit avoir accept\u00e9 les affirmations de Mme Ouellette et de Mme Laurin sur le fait qu\u2019elles avaient eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre Mme Nipa ou \u00e0 suivre son raisonnement lors de l\u2019entrevue non officielle. Mme Parent a dit qu\u2019elle croyait qu\u2019elles en \u00e9taient arriv\u00e9es \u00e0 cette conclusion parce que certaines des r\u00e9ponses de Mme Nipa ne r\u00e9pondaient pas aux questions pos\u00e9es lors de l\u2019entrevue non officielle, mais elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de fournir d\u2019exemples.\n[43] Mme Parent a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, n\u2019ayant jamais rencontr\u00e9 ce type de situation auparavant, elle a demand\u00e9 conseil \u00e0 son conseiller en ressources humaines, M. Patrick Toupin, qu\u2019elle a consult\u00e9 le jour m\u00eame de l\u2019entrevue non officielle. M. Toupin a t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Il a livr\u00e9 un t\u00e9moignage franc et cr\u00e9dible, et s\u2019est montr\u00e9 bien inform\u00e9 des r\u00e8gles et des lois en vigueur dans le domaine de l\u2019emploi. M. Toupin a inform\u00e9 Mme Parent que l\u2019article 30 de la LEFP l\u2019emp\u00eachait d\u2019embaucher Mme Nipa si elle estimait que celle-ci ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite, m\u00eame si elle avait satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite lors de l\u2019entrevue fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite. M. Toupin a dit \u00e0 Mme Parent qu\u2019elle devrait tenir compte de l\u2019entrevue non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite pour prendre sa d\u00e9cision si cette entrevue montrait que la candidate ne satisfaisait pas aux crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite compte tenu de l\u2019ensemble des renseignements dont elle disposait.\n[44] \u00c0 la suite de ces discussions et de ces consultations, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 convenu que Mme Abou-Hamad et Mme Belsher modifieraient la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite de la [traduction] \u00ab capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral \u00bb, la faisant passer de 3 (passable\/r\u00e9ussite) \u00e0 2 (faible\/\u00e9chec). En raison de ce changement, Mme Nipa a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus de s\u00e9lection puisqu\u2019elle ne satisfaisait pas \u00e0 l\u2019un des crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de la situation par un courriel dat\u00e9 du 24 f\u00e9vrier 2020, qui mentionnait express\u00e9ment qu\u2019elle avait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus de s\u00e9lection parce qu\u2019elle ne satisfaisait pas au crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite concernant la capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral.

Sur les 12 candidats retenus, six avaient d\u00e9clar\u00e9 \u00eatre membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible et quatre de ces six personnes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9es \u00e0 partir du bassin.\n[46] Mme Nipa est la seule candidate \u00e0 ce processus de s\u00e9lection qui avait satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite au terme de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, mais dont la r\u00e9ussite a \u00e9t\u00e9 transform\u00e9e en \u00e9chec apr\u00e8s l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite. Parmi les candidats retenus, c\u2019est Mme Nipa qui a obtenu la note la plus faible lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite. Elle est la seule \u00e0 avoir obtenu une note de 3 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 6. Tous les autres candidats ont obtenu des notes plus \u00e9lev\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de ce crit\u00e8re.\n[47] Aucun des t\u00e9moins, y compris Mme Parent (la gestionnaire d\u2019embauche) et M.

Des s\u00e9ances de formation et des cours sur la diversit\u00e9 en milieu de travail et sur la discrimination et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients ont \u00e9t\u00e9 offerts aux employ\u00e9s. Des statistiques produites par l\u2019intim\u00e9 montrent que la pr\u00e9sence des minorit\u00e9s visibles au sein de son effectif est sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 leur disponibilit\u00e9 au sein de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre. En particulier, elles montrent que les candidats de la m\u00eame origine ethnique que Mme Nipa ont plus de chances de r\u00e9ussir les concours que la moyenne des candidats, et que l\u2019intim\u00e9 embauche des personnes originaires d\u2019Asie du Sud \u00e0 un taux sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 celui de leur disponibilit\u00e9 au sein de la main-d\u2019\u0153uvre.\n[50] Mme Nipa s\u2019est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re franche et cr\u00e9dible \u00e0 l\u2019audience.

Cela dit, je n\u2019\u00e9tais \u00e9videmment pas pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l\u2019une ou l\u2019autre des entrevues et celles-ci n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9es.

Elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elles n\u2019avaient pris aucune note pendant la longue entrevue, \u00e0 l\u2019exception d\u2019une tr\u00e8s courte note indiquant qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas bilingue et qu\u2019elle aurait besoin de donner un pr\u00e9avis d\u2019une semaine \u00e0 ses deux employeurs \u00e0 temps partiel avant de pouvoir commencer \u00e0 travailler, si elle \u00e9tait embauch\u00e9e.\n[54] Mme Nipa a contest\u00e9 la pr\u00e9tention selon laquelle Mme St-Louis, qui n\u2019a pas particip\u00e9 aux entrevues, n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de la comprendre, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait pu suivre toutes les instructions de Mme St-Louis pour se pr\u00e9senter et participer \u00e0 l\u2019entrevue.\n[55] Selon Mme Nipa, il \u00e9tait incoh\u00e9rent et contraire au processus de s\u00e9lection cens\u00e9 \u00eatre fond\u00e9 sur le m\u00e9rite qu\u2019elle soit \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus le 24 f\u00e9vrier 2020 pour avoir \u00e9chou\u00e9 au crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite relatif \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement, alors qu\u2019elle avait initialement satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res essentiels fond\u00e9s sur le m\u00e9rite, y compris \u00e0 celui relatif \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite tenue le 20 janvier 2020. Selon elle, le fait que sa note a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e dans ces circonstances d\u00e9montre qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 l\u2019objet de discrimination en raison de sa race et de son origine ethnique.\n[56] En outre, Mme Nipa est d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est incoh\u00e9rent et illogique qu\u2019aucune autre modification n\u2019ait \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e pour lui attribuer des \u00e9checs au regard des autres crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite, malgr\u00e9 le fait que tous les autres crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite d\u00e9pendaient de ses capacit\u00e9s \u00e0 communiquer efficacement \u00e0 l\u2019oral, qui devaient \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9es par rapport \u00e0 ses r\u00e9ponses \u00e0 chacun des autres crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels.\n[57] Selon Mme Nipa, il \u00e9tait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9thique et discriminatoire qu\u2019elle ait \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus de s\u00e9lection sur la base de consid\u00e9rations subjectives (le crit\u00e8re du meilleur candidat ou de la meilleure candidate) \u00e9valu\u00e9es lors d\u2019une entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, alors qu\u2019elle avait satisfait \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite lors de l\u2019entrevue officielle et qu\u2019elle avait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 tous les renseignements requis pour d\u00e9montrer ses qualifications.

La pr\u00e9sence d\u2019irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans le processus d\u2019embauche, m\u00eame s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le processus d\u2019embauche comportait \u00ab un d\u00e9faut grave \u00bb, n\u2019est pas une preuve de discrimination. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de contr\u00f4le et de surveillance du fonctionnement du processus de dotation r\u00e9gi par la LEFP. Le r\u00f4le du Tribunal n\u2019est pas de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe des irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s dans le processus d\u2019embauche, mais se limite plut\u00f4t \u00e0 dire si oui ou non ces irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 motiv\u00e9es par des motifs de distinction illicite. (Voir Salem c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2008 TCDP 13, au par. 72; Dokis c. Bande indienne de Dokis, 1995 CanLII 10394 (TCDP); Kibale c. Transports Canada, 1985 CanLII 90 (TCDP)).\n[69] Pour \u00e9tablir une preuve prima facie de discrimination, le plaignant n\u2019est pas tenu de prouver que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention d\u2019agir de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire, car certains actes discriminatoires mettent en cause de multiples facteurs et sont inconscients. En fait, on dit souvent qu\u2019un acte discriminatoire n\u2019est pas une pratique qui, d\u2019ordinaire, se manifesterait ouvertement ou m\u00eame s\u2019exercerait intentionnellement. De ce fait, le Tribunal se doit d\u2019examiner l\u2019ensemble des circonstances de l\u2019affaire \u2014 ce qui, bien souvent, suppose des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle qui tant\u00f4t \u00e9tayent tant\u00f4t minent l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination \u2014 pour pouvoir d\u00e9cider s\u2019il existe ce que le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 qualifi\u00e9 de \u00ab subtile odeur de discrimination \u00bb. (Voir Bombardier, aux par. 40 et 41; Basi c. Cie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 1988 CanLII 108 (TCDP); Peel Law Association v. Pieters, 2013 ONCA 396, aux par. 72 et 8; Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employees Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 RCS 3, au par. 29.)\n[70] Il suffit qu\u2019un seul motif de discrimination ait jou\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision d\u2019un intim\u00e9 de ne pas embaucher le plaignant pour que celui-ci ait gain de cause sous le r\u00e9gime de la LCDP. Il incombe donc au Tribunal de d\u00e9terminer si la discrimination a jou\u00e9 un r\u00f4le dans le refus d\u2019embaucher. Pour ce faire, il est tenu de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la totalit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle, de tirer des conclusions de fait et de d\u00e9cider si l\u2019inf\u00e9rence qu\u2019il est possible de tirer des faits \u00e9taye une conclusion de discrimination selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s. Cependant, il doit y avoir un lien entre la conduite examin\u00e9e et un motif de distinction illicite. Le lien peut \u00eatre d\u00e9duit \u00e0 partir d\u2019une preuve circonstancielle, mais la conclusion de discrimination doit \u00eatre plus probable que toute autre conclusion possible. Pour tirer une telle conclusion, il faut que le fait en cause soit \u00e9tabli par d\u2019autres faits. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire que chaque \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve conduise \u00e0 cette conclusion. Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, qui sont insuffisants pris individuellement, permettent, une fois combin\u00e9s, de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence du fait en cause. La conclusion de discrimination que tire le Tribunal peut reposer aussi bien sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve circonstancielle que sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve directs, anecdotiques ou statistiques. (Voir Khiamal c. Canada, 2009 CF 495, aux par. 80 \u00e0 84.)\n[71] Si un plaignant \u00e9tablit une preuve prima facie de discrimination, il incombe alors \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9 de d\u00e9montrer, au moyen d\u2019une explication raisonnable, soit que la discrimination n\u2019a pas eu lieu, soit que la conduite n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Il faut que cette explication soit cr\u00e9dible, et non qu\u2019elle constitue un simple pr\u00e9texte servant \u00e0 dissimuler la discrimination. (Voir Bombardier, au par. 37).\nIV. ANALYSE [72] Qu\u2019elle soit discriminatoire ou non, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 de modifier la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa et de l\u2019\u00e9liminer du processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s inhabituelle, voire irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re et vici\u00e9e du point de vue de la proc\u00e9dure. Aucun des t\u00e9moins chevronn\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait jamais entendu parler d\u2019une telle situation.\n[73] En outre, la d\u00e9cision a clairement \u00e9t\u00e9 blessante pour Mme Nipa et a eu un effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur elle. Mme Nipa, qui est originaire du Bangladesh, n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 inform\u00e9e de son \u00e9limination qu\u2019apr\u00e8s la deuxi\u00e8me entrevue et a \u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0 juste titre, surprise et boulevers\u00e9e par le r\u00e9sultat, comme l\u2019a reconnu l\u2019intim\u00e9. Ce r\u00e9sultat a port\u00e9 un coup \u00e0 son estime de soi et \u00e0 sa dignit\u00e9.\n[74] \u00c0 la lumi\u00e8re des exigences li\u00e9es au m\u00e9rite de l\u2019article 30 de la LEFP, invoqu\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9 pour \u00e9tayer sa th\u00e8se, la d\u00e9cision de modifier la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa et de l\u2019\u00e9liminer du processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e0 la suite d\u2019une entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite, qui \u00e9tait cens\u00e9e porter sur une \u00e9valuation subjective pour trouver les meilleurs candidats pour le poste, plut\u00f4t que sur le m\u00e9rite, semble \u00e9galement quelque peu contradictoire. L\u2019entrevue non officielle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas pr\u00e9vue dans les renseignements sur le processus mis \u00e0 la disposition des candidats et n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e qu\u2019avec certains candidats, parce que trop de candidats ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retenus \u00e0 l\u2019issue de l\u2019entrevue fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite. Si l\u2019entrevue non officielle et non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite n\u2019avait pas eu lieu, la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9e et elle n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[75] Il semble \u00e9galement surprenant et regrettable, compte tenu des circonstances inhabituelles de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, que les intervieweuses n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, de se souvenir d\u2019exemples pr\u00e9cis pour justifier leurs commentaires g\u00e9n\u00e9raux selon lesquelles Mme Nipa \u00e9tait difficile \u00e0 comprendre, ou qu\u2019elles n\u2019aient pas, \u00e0 une exception pr\u00e8s, not\u00e9 d\u2019exemples lors des entrevues, m\u00eame dans le cas de la premi\u00e8re entrevue, o\u00f9 un compte rendu d\u00e9taill\u00e9 des r\u00e9ponses donn\u00e9es a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9. Les intervieweuses ont d\u00fb comprendre Mme Nipa suffisamment bien pour prendre des notes.\n[76] La seule exception est la tr\u00e8s br\u00e8ve note prise par Mme Laurin concernant la r\u00e9ponse de Mme Nipa \u00e0 la question portant sur sa disponibilit\u00e9 pour commencer \u00e0 travailler si elle \u00e9tait choisie. Cette note ne permet pas de conna\u00eetre la question qui a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9e et la r\u00e9ponse qui a r\u00e9ellement \u00e9t\u00e9 donn\u00e9e, ni de savoir en quoi la r\u00e9ponse donn\u00e9e justifie les commentaires n\u00e9gatifs sur ses comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de communication orale.\n[77] En outre, il semble \u00e9trange que la d\u00e9cision de modifier la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa et de lui attribuer un \u00e9chec en raison de ses faibles comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de communication orale ait \u00e9t\u00e9 prise dans le cadre d\u2019un processus de s\u00e9lection pour un poste de d\u00e9butant en d\u00e9pit de ses r\u00e9f\u00e9rences tr\u00e8s positives concernant son travail au Canada, accept\u00e9es par l\u2019intim\u00e9, ainsi que de ses dipl\u00f4mes universitaires et de son dipl\u00f4me d\u2019\u00e9tudes juridiques obtenu aupr\u00e8s d\u2019un coll\u00e8ge communautaire canadien, \u00e9galement accept\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[78] Il semble \u00e9galement curieux que les notes accord\u00e9es pour les cinq autres crit\u00e8res de m\u00e9rite essentiels, qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9valu\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re objective et qui d\u00e9pendaient des comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de communication orale de Mme Nipa, n\u2019aient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9es lorsque la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa pour le crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 6 est pass\u00e9e de 3 (r\u00e9ussite) \u00e0 2 (\u00e9chec) \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019entrevue non fond\u00e9e sur le m\u00e9rite.\n[79] Enfin, avec le recul, compte tenu des circonstances tr\u00e8s inhabituelles de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il faut se demander s\u2019il n\u2019aurait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable que l\u2019intim\u00e9 invite Mme Nipa \u00e0 se pr\u00e9senter \u00e0 une troisi\u00e8me entrevue avec Mme Parent ou un autre groupe d\u2019intervieweurs dans le but de v\u00e9rifier ses comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de communication orale avant de modifier la note qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et de l\u2019\u00e9liminer du processus de s\u00e9lection.\n[80] Cela dit, comme l\u2019indiquent les d\u00e9cisions cit\u00e9es ci-dessus, il n\u2019appartient pas au Tribunal de se pencher sur le caract\u00e8re ad\u00e9quat ou le bien-fond\u00e9 des proc\u00e9dures d\u2019embauche de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et le choix des candidats, m\u00eame dans le cas de processus de s\u00e9lection inhabituels et peut-\u00eatre m\u00eame vici\u00e9s. Toutefois, dans le cas o\u00f9 des crit\u00e8res subjectifs sont utilis\u00e9s pour prendre une d\u00e9cision d\u2019embauche, il faut examiner cette d\u00e9cision attentivement pour d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait teint\u00e9e de discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre des motifs de distinction all\u00e9gu\u00e9s.\n[81] Malgr\u00e9 les circonstances inhabituelles de la pr\u00e9sente affaire et la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il y ait eu certaines irr\u00e9gularit\u00e9s, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, j\u2019estime, apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune preuve directe ou indirecte \u00e9tablissant, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 avait l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa ou qu\u2019il a consciemment fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard. Rien n\u2019indique que les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 ont commis des actes manifestes de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa.\n[82] En outre, j\u2019accepte le t\u00e9moignage des t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon lequel ils ne pensaient pas faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa lorsqu\u2019ils ont modifi\u00e9 la note qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9e et l\u2019ont \u00e9limin\u00e9e du processus de s\u00e9lection. Je crois qu\u2019ils pensaient sinc\u00e8rement qu\u2019elle ne poss\u00e9dait pas les comp\u00e9tences requises en mati\u00e8re de communication orale pour \u00eatre embauch\u00e9e sur le fondement du m\u00e9rite, comme l\u2019exige l\u2019article 30 de la LEFP, et qu\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[83] M\u00eame si l\u2019\u00e9valuation du crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite no 6 \u00e9tait subjective, la d\u00e9cision de l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019\u00e9tait pas, \u00e0 mon avis, un pr\u00e9texte pour faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa. J\u2019accepte la preuve de l\u2019intim\u00e9 selon laquelle la diff\u00e9rence entre la note de passage (3) et un \u00e9chec (2) \u00e9tait tr\u00e8s mince. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Nipa avait obtenu la note la plus basse pour ce crit\u00e8re de m\u00e9rite essentiel et que les quatre personnes ayant men\u00e9 les entrevues avaient dans l\u2019ensemble le m\u00eame avis sur ses comp\u00e9tences en mati\u00e8re de communication orale, la d\u00e9cision me semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 raisonnable.\n[84] J\u2019accepte \u00e9galement les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve fournis par l\u2019intim\u00e9 concernant la grande diversit\u00e9 de son effectif et la formation donn\u00e9e aux employ\u00e9s sur la pr\u00e9vention de la discrimination, y compris la discrimination inconsciente. Ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e9tayent mon opinion selon laquelle il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019un lieu de travail o\u00f9 le processus d\u2019embauche est normalement teint\u00e9 de discrimination et qu\u2019il est donc peu probable que les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 aient eu l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa. L\u2019une des intervieweuses ayant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience s\u2019identifie d\u2019ailleurs comme \u00e9tant membre d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 ethnique visible. La preuve non contredite est que l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019est pas en d\u00e9faveur de l\u2019embauche de personnes originaires d\u2019Asie du Sud. La moiti\u00e9 des candidats retenus lors du processus de s\u00e9lection en cause sont des membres de minorit\u00e9s visibles qui ont r\u00e9ussi l\u2019entrevue officielle. Un tiers d\u2019entre eux ont \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9s par l\u2019intim\u00e9.\n[85] Malgr\u00e9 ma conclusion selon laquelle l\u2019intim\u00e9 n\u2019avait pas l\u2019intention de faire preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa, compte tenu des circonstances inhabituelles de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, il m\u2019incombe d\u2019examiner les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il pourrait y avoir eu des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients ou involontaires dans la d\u00e9cision de modifier la note accord\u00e9e \u00e0 Mme Nipa et de l\u2019\u00e9liminer du processus de s\u00e9lection. En d\u2019autres termes, il s\u2019agit de savoir si les employ\u00e9s qui ont particip\u00e9 \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision ont inconsciemment entretenu des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Nipa en raison de sa race ou de son origine ethnique, pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s qui auraient pu influer sur leur d\u00e9cision.\n[86] Il va sans dire qu\u2019il est extr\u00eamement difficile d\u2019essayer de d\u00e9terminer si les employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9, qui ont affirm\u00e9 ne pas avoir eu de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s contre Mme Nipa, ont entretenu des pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019ils n\u2019auraient pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de reconna\u00eetre. La conduite inhabituelle, voire irr\u00e9guli\u00e8re, des employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible et injuste, mais elle ne d\u00e9montre pas en soi que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019\u00e9liminer Mme Nipa du processus de s\u00e9lection \u00e9tait empreinte de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients ou de discrimination.\n[87] En l\u2019absence d\u2019actes discriminatoires intentionnels, je ne peux tout au plus qu\u2019examiner la conduite contest\u00e9e pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il est plus probable qu\u2019improbable qu\u2019on puisse inf\u00e9rer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien entre la conduite et un motif de distinction illicite all\u00e9gu\u00e9 par Mme Nipa sur la base de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s inconscients des personnes ayant pris la d\u00e9cision en cause.\n[88] Compte tenu de la preuve, je ne suis pas en mesure de tirer une telle inf\u00e9rence en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Aucun \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 concernant l\u2019existence de pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement r\u00e9pandus dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes de la race ou de l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique de Mme Nipa.\n[89] En revanche, comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 mentionn\u00e9, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve statistiques ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s pour montrer la grande diversit\u00e9 de l\u2019effectif de l\u2019intim\u00e9, y compris au bureau de l\u2019AIPRP, o\u00f9 les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire se sont d\u00e9roul\u00e9s. La preuve a permis d\u2019\u00e9tablir que le taux d\u2019employ\u00e9s de l\u2019intim\u00e9 qui sont membres d\u2019une minorit\u00e9 visible d\u00e9passe celui de leur disponibilit\u00e9 sur le march\u00e9 du travail et que les candidats de la m\u00eame origine ethnique que Mme Nipa ont plus de chances de r\u00e9ussir les concours que la moyenne des candidats.

De plus, elle a ajout\u00e9 quatre requ\u00eates. Dans l\u2019une des requ\u00eates, elle demandait au Tribunal de se prononcer sur le manquement all\u00e9gu\u00e9 du Canada \u00e0 la Convention des Nations Unies relative aux droits de l\u2019enfant (1989) (la \u00ab Convention des Nations Unies \u00bb) et dans une autre, elle demandait au Tribunal d\u2019ajouter le Canada comme intim\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019affaire.\n[12] Par cons\u00e9quent, le 3 ao\u00fbt 2022, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019organiser une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire pour discuter de l\u2019\u00e9largissement apparent de la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[13] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 cette demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, Mme Holmen a envoy\u00e9 un courriel au Tribunal et aux parties et a accus\u00e9 l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e d\u2019avoir des associ\u00e9s \u00e0 Edmonton qui l\u2019avaient [traduction] \u00ab agress\u00e9e sexuellement, harcel\u00e9e collectivement et enlev\u00e9e \u00bb. Elle a \u00e9galement fait part de ses disponibilit\u00e9s pour la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire et a ajout\u00e9 qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9sumait ainsi ne pas [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019ajouter \u00e0 la liste des femmes disparues et assassin\u00e9es entretemps pour avoir port\u00e9 atteinte au droit patriarcal blanc du gouvernement du Canada de violer, d\u2019agresser sexuellement, de harceler et de terroriser qui il veut, librement, \u00e0 son gr\u00e9 et sur commande \u00bb.\n[14] Le 1er septembre 2022, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 une lettre aux parties pour les aider \u00e0 comprendre l\u2019objectif vis\u00e9 par un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et pour les informer des questions soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et dans les avis de requ\u00eate de Mme Holmen. Il a fait remarquer qu\u2019un plaignant ne peut pas soulever dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions des all\u00e9gations qui sont nouvelles ou qui ne sont pas li\u00e9es \u00e0 la plainte ayant fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une enqu\u00eate par la Commission et d\u2019un renvoi devant le Tribunal. Il a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas comp\u00e9tence pour se prononcer sur la Convention des Nations Unies et que le Canada \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 un intim\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire.\n[15] La conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire a eu lieu le 22 septembre 2022. Le Tribunal a pass\u00e9 en revue la lettre qu\u2019il avait envoy\u00e9e aux parties le 1er septembre et a formul\u00e9 certains commentaires pour aider Mme Holmen \u00e0 comprendre l\u2019objet d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions afin qu\u2019elle puisse modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et que le dossier puisse aller de l\u2019avant. Comme Mme Holmen agissait pour son propre compte, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a offert de l\u2019aider \u00e0 apporter les modifications n\u00e9cessaires. Elle a donc accept\u00e9 de parler \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la Commission dans les jours suivants et de r\u00e9viser son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions au plus tard le 22 octobre 2022, m\u00eame si le Tribunal n\u2019avait pas fix\u00e9 de date afin de lui laisser suffisamment de temps.\n[16] L\u2019avocat de la Commission a tent\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de discuter avec Mme Holmen pour l\u2019aider \u00e0 r\u00e9viser son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, mais cette derni\u00e8re n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu et n\u2019a pas apport\u00e9 de modifications.\n[17] Le 5 mai 2023, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a \u00e9crit aux parties et au Tribunal pour demander au Tribunal de fixer une date \u00e0 laquelle Mme Holmen remettrait un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 ou d\u2019organiser une autre conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire afin de discuter de la suite \u00e0 donner \u00e0 l\u2019affaire.\n[18] En r\u00e9ponse, Mme Holmen a envoy\u00e9 deux courriels aux parties, au Tribunal et aux autres membres du public dans lesquels elle all\u00e9guait que l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne [traduction] \u00ab v[oulait] pas que ses victimes puissent s\u2019exprimer \u00bb et que les \u00ab sales Blancs responsables de l\u2019apartheid se trouv[aient] devant un organisme de r\u00e9glementation \u00bb. Mme Holmen a \u00e9galement soulev\u00e9 la question de savoir si l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e avait ordonn\u00e9 l\u2019enl\u00e8vement de ses enfants et a menac\u00e9 de d\u00e9truire sa [traduction] \u00ab putain de maison devant le monde entier pendant qu[\u2019il] f[erait] face \u00e0 des repr\u00e9sailles et f[erait] l\u2019objet d\u2019accusations pour complot criminel \u00bb.\n[19] Le 9 mai 2023, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courriel aux parties pour demander la tenue d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire en juillet ou en ao\u00fbt.\n[20] Le m\u00eame jour, l\u2019avocat de la Commission a \u00e9crit aux parties pour les aviser que la Commission ne participerait plus \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, y compris \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation, \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance et aux audiences.\n[21] Ce jour-l\u00e0 \u00e9galement, Mme Holmen a r\u00e9pondu par courriel \u00e0 la demande du Tribunal et a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne voulait en aucun cas [traduction] \u00ab participer \u00e0 un processus judiciaire corrompu \u00bb. Par ailleurs, elle a accus\u00e9 toutes les parties d\u2019avoir cherch\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin, \u00e0 entraver et \u00e0 d\u00e9tourner le cours de l\u2019affaire \u00bb; elle a accus\u00e9 le membre du Tribunal d\u2019avoir \u00ab voulu [lui] mettre des b\u00e2tons dans les roues en d\u00e9tenant [s]es enfants dans un lieu tenu secret \u00bb et d\u2019avoir r\u00e9clam\u00e9 une ran\u00e7on \u00ab afin qu\u2019[elle] ne demande pas aux organismes de r\u00e9glementation d\u2019examiner la conduite professionnelle du membre le plus ancien du Tribunal \u00bb; et elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le ministre Lametti d\u00e9capiterait tous les destinataires de son courriel pour avoir d\u00e9fendu leurs \u00ab int\u00e9r\u00eats et objectifs politiques \u00bb.\n[22] Le m\u00eame jour, le Tribunal a \u00e9crit aux parties pour les informer que, comme Mme Holmen avait refus\u00e9 de participer, il ne serait pas possible de tenir une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire comme le demandait l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que cette derni\u00e8re pouvait envisager de pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 faire rejeter la plainte.\n[23] Apr\u00e8s avoir re\u00e7u la correspondance du Tribunal, Mme Holmen a envoy\u00e9 sept courriels aux parties, au Tribunal, au directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral adjoint et avocat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et aux autres membres du public. Ces sept courriels contenaient de fausses accusations, des commentaires grossiers et obsc\u00e8nes et des menaces \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de l\u2019avocat de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, de l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal, du membre du Tribunal et d\u2019autres personnes. Elle a notamment \u00e9crit dans ces courriels que le membre du Tribunal \u00e9tait un [traduction] \u00ab homme malhonn\u00eate et corruptible \u00bb et que l\u2019agent du greffe \u00e9tait un \u00ab sale con, manipulateur, colonialiste, kidnappeur \u00bb.\n[24] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate le 13 juin 2023 et Mme Holmen a r\u00e9pondu les 14 et 19 juin par des courriels dans lesquels elle indiquait qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait hospitalis\u00e9e, qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par un avocat et qu\u2019elle cherchait \u00e0 obtenir une m\u00e9diation.\n[25] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 Mme Holmen le 20 juin 2023 et lui a fait remarquer qu\u2019elle r\u00e9p\u00e9tait les m\u00eames comportements lorsqu\u2019elle attaquait des personnes et entit\u00e9s, notamment lorsqu\u2019elle accusait [traduction] \u00ab la Commission d\u2019\u00eatre corrompue et incomp\u00e9tente \u00bb et de \u00ab passer sous silence le viol et le racisme \u00bb et qu\u2019elle parlait d\u2019ing\u00e9rence judiciaire, d\u2019\u00ab abus de pouvoir des policiers \u00bb et de \u00ab manquement [g\u00e9n\u00e9ral] au devoir \u00bb.\n[26] L\u2019intim\u00e9e a aussi soulign\u00e9 dans sa r\u00e9ponse que Mme Holmen continuait \u00e0 faire des all\u00e9gations et \u00e0 soulever des questions qui n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec la plainte, notamment au sujet de la GRC qui aurait commis des actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles et du fait qu\u2019elle aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e injustement et qu\u2019elle aurait touch\u00e9 des prestations d\u2019assurance-emploi, sans oublier qu\u2019elle faisait allusion \u00e0 des personnes dont il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas question dans la plainte. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a indiqu\u00e9 que rien ne permettait de prouver ou d\u2019\u00e9tayer la th\u00e8se selon laquelle Mme Holmen avait \u00e9t\u00e9 hospitalis\u00e9e et que c\u2019\u00e9tait la premi\u00e8re fois que Mme Holmen demandait une m\u00e9diation depuis que le Tribunal avait \u00e9t\u00e9 saisi de l\u2019affaire. L\u2019intim\u00e9e a refus\u00e9 d\u2019acquiescer \u00e0 la demande de m\u00e9diation de Mme Holmen.\n[27] Enfin, dans sa r\u00e9ponse, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Holmen n\u2019avait jamais soulev\u00e9 la question de la repr\u00e9sentation en justice et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas profit\u00e9 de l\u2019offre que lui avait faite la Commission, soit de l\u2019aider \u00e0 modifier son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Cependant, l\u2019intim\u00e9e a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab si elle souhaite retenir les services d\u2019un avocat, elle devrait pouvoir le faire. Or, cette d\u00e9marche ne servirait qu\u2019\u00e0 r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9e dans le but de faire rejeter la plainte puisqu\u2019il faut r\u00e9gler ce point avant de pouvoir faire quoi que ce soit d\u2019autre dans l\u2019affaire. Il est sugg\u00e9r\u00e9 que la plaignante ait jusqu\u2019au 31 juillet 2023 pour retenir les services d\u2019un avocat et pour que celui-ci pr\u00e9sente ses observations sur la requ\u00eate, faute de quoi la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e sera examin\u00e9e par le Tribunal sans plus tarder \u00bb.\n[28] Le 26 juin 2023, le Tribunal a envoy\u00e9 un courriel aux parties pour les aviser que Mme Holmen avait jusqu\u2019au 18 ao\u00fbt 2023 pour retenir les services d\u2019un avocat qui l\u2019aiderait \u00e0 donner une r\u00e9ponse valable \u00e0 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et que, si elle n\u2019en faisait rien ou si son avocat ne pr\u00e9sentait pas d\u2019observations avant cette date, le Tribunal statuerait sur la requ\u00eate sans plus tarder.\n[29] Le Tribunal n\u2019a re\u00e7u aucune information selon laquelle Mme Holmen avait retenu les services d\u2019un avocat avant le 18 ao\u00fbt 2023 et n\u2019a pas non plus re\u00e7u d\u2019autres observations relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nIII. CADRE JURIDIQUE [30] Le Tribunal peut rendre une ordonnance rejetant la plainte pour non-respect des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021) (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb), pour comportement vexatoire ou pour abus de proc\u00e9dure en vertu des articles 9 et 10 des R\u00e8gles.\n[31] Les plaideurs de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale peuvent se voir interdire de poursuivre l\u2019instance s\u2019ils ont agi de fa\u00e7on vexatoire. Ils peuvent \u00eatre consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme qu\u00e9rulents lorsqu\u2019ils formulent des all\u00e9gations non fond\u00e9es d\u2019actes irr\u00e9guliers contre la partie adverse, l\u2019avocat ou la cour; qu\u2019ils refusent de se plier aux r\u00e8gles et aux ordonnances de la cour; ou qu\u2019ils tiennent des propos scandaleux pendant les actes de proc\u00e9dure ou devant la cour. Un tel comportement vexatoire justifie une ordonnance de rejet. Tonner c. Lowry, 2016 CF 230, aux par. 17-20; Hunt c. Canada, 2017 CF 251, au par. 33.\n[32] L\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure consiste en des proc\u00e9dures injustes au point d\u2019\u00eatre contraires \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et en un traitement abusif. Le Tribunal peut alors invoquer la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure pour rejeter une plainte lorsque les proc\u00e9dures sont oppressives ou vexatoires et qu\u2019elles violent les principes fondamentaux de justice sous-jacents au sens de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de la d\u00e9cence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9. Les all\u00e9gations non fond\u00e9es de conduite r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme un abus de proc\u00e9dure. Les all\u00e9gations r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9es et non fond\u00e9es d\u2019un plaignant \u00e0 l\u2019endroit d\u2019un membre du Tribunal constituent un abus de proc\u00e9dure pouvant mener au rejet de la plainte lorsqu\u2019il semble que l\u2019abus se poursuivra tout au long de l\u2019instance et qu\u2019aucune r\u00e9paration ne peut faire dispara\u00eetre le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par l\u2019abus en question. Cecilia Constantinescu c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2022 TCDP 13, aux par. 14-27.\nIV. OBSERVATIONS DE L\u2019INTIM\u00c9E [33] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient que la conduite adopt\u00e9e par Mme Holmen tout au long de l\u2019instruction de sa plainte est vexatoire et justifie une conclusion d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure. Dans les communications qu\u2019elle a envoy\u00e9es au Tribunal, aux parties et \u00e0 d\u2019autres personnes, Mme Holmen n\u2019a cess\u00e9 de faire des d\u00e9clarations grossi\u00e8res, insultantes, mena\u00e7antes et non fond\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du membre du Tribunal, des membres du personnel du Tribunal, des parties et d\u2019autres personnes, et a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019il y avait eu collusion, corruption, partialit\u00e9, criminalit\u00e9, pots-de-vin, entrave \u00e0 la justice et enl\u00e8vement de ses enfants.\n[34] L\u2019intim\u00e9e estime que le comportement de Mme Holmen r\u00e9pond aux crit\u00e8res \u00e9nonc\u00e9s par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale en ce qui a trait \u00e0 un plaideur qu\u00e9rulent et qu\u2019il a port\u00e9 atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019administration de la justice. Ni le Tribunal ni l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne doivent tol\u00e9rer les insultes, les all\u00e9gations non fond\u00e9es d\u2019actes r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensibles ou les menaces dans le cadre de la proc\u00e9dure. ll est totalement d\u00e9raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce que la plainte soit trait\u00e9e dans de telles circonstances.\n[35] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient non seulement que Mme Holmen a agi de mani\u00e8re offensante, mais qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 de diligence puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas r\u00e9vis\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, comme on le lui avait demand\u00e9, et qu\u2019elle a cess\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure. Compte tenu des accusations, des menaces et des insultes incessantes, il est \u00e9vident que ce comportement vexatoire va se manifester, se perp\u00e9tuer et s\u2019aggraver tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure si rien n\u2019est fait.\n[36] L\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient \u00e9galement que, comme la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal se rapporte \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus entre 2014 et 2017, les t\u00e9moins devront se rappeler de d\u00e9tails qui remontent \u00e0 pr\u00e8s de dix ans, et que plus le temps passe, plus il subit un pr\u00e9judice.\n[37] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9e soutient qu\u2019aucune autre r\u00e9paration que le rejet de la plainte ne peut raisonnablement faire dispara\u00eetre le pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par Mme Holmen. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que Mme Holmen a cess\u00e9 de participer \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure, qu\u2019elle a manqu\u00e9 de respect envers le Tribunal et les parties et qu\u2019elle a fait fi des R\u00e8gles, la plainte devrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e afin que le Tribunal puisse consacrer ses ressources \u00e0 des plaintes qui en valent davantage la peine.\nV. ANALYSE [38] Je suis d\u2019accord avec toutes les observations de l\u2019intim\u00e9e et je les accepte.\n[39] Le comportement de Mme Holmen en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce est \u00e0 la fois triste et troublant. Il est difficile de comprendre ce qui peut pousser une personne \u00e0 se comporter comme Mme Holmen l\u2019a fait, surtout si l\u2019on tient compte du soutien que lui ont offert le Tribunal et la Commission pour qu\u2019elle puisse pr\u00e9parer son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[40] Le Tribunal doit faire preuve de prudence lorsqu\u2019il accueille une requ\u00eate visant le rejet d\u2019une plainte qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e pour instruction avant la cl\u00f4ture des actes de proc\u00e9dure, mais les faits de la pr\u00e9sente affaire exigent bien \u00e9videmment que des mesures soient prises pour pr\u00e9server l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de la proc\u00e9dure et \u00e9viter toute autre perte de temps dans une affaire qui semble avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9laiss\u00e9e par la plaignante. Les ressources du Tribunal sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 limit\u00e9es et ne devraient pas \u00eatre monopolis\u00e9es par des affaires qui ne m\u00e9ritent pas d\u2019\u00eatre instruites, comme celle-ci, alors que d\u2019autres affaires m\u00e9ritent d\u2019\u00eatre instruites, et ce, sans d\u00e9lai.\n[41] Non seulement les commentaires de Mme Holmen \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des nombreuses personnes impliqu\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire sont insultants, profanes, grossiers et mena\u00e7ants, mais ses all\u00e9gations \u2014 notamment celle relative \u00e0 l\u2019enl\u00e8vement de ses enfants \u2014 sont absurdes. Personne ne m\u00e9rite d\u2019\u00eatre trait\u00e9 comme Mme Holmen nous a trait\u00e9s et ce comportement ne sera plus tol\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[42] De plus, le fait que Mme Holmen n\u2019ait pas modifi\u00e9 son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions comme elle devait le faire, qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait pas assist\u00e9 \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire comme elle devait le fait et qu\u2019elle n\u2019ait m\u00eame pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un manque total de respect \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Tribunal, des parties et de la proc\u00e9dure et indique qu\u2019elle s\u2019est d\u00e9sist\u00e9e de la plainte. Il s\u2019agit clairement d\u2019un cas o\u00f9 le comportement vexatoire constitue un abus de proc\u00e9dure au sens des R\u00e8gles auquel il faut mettre fin imm\u00e9diatement, car autrement tout le monde continuera \u00e0 perdre son temps. Il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre solution raisonnable que le rejet de la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\nVI.

Avant le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, le SCRS a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal d\u2019ordonner que les employ\u00e9s actuels ou anciens du SCRS puissent t\u00e9moigner avec leur cam\u00e9ra d\u00e9sactiv\u00e9e ou en utilisant la fonction \u00ab audio seulement \u00bb de Zoom.\nLe Tribunal a refus\u00e9 cette requ\u00eate.

Cependant, le Tribunal a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que lorsque ces t\u00e9moins t\u00e9moigneront, ils le feront avec leur cam\u00e9ra activ\u00e9e. Le public ne sera toutefois pas autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 assister \u00e0 cette partie de l\u2019audience. Le Tribunal versera un enregistrement audio au dossier officiel. Ainsi, cette d\u00e9cision assurera le besoin de protection de la vie priv\u00e9e et l\u2019acc\u00e8s du public aux informations importantes.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2023 TCDP\n37\nDate : le\n31 ao\u00fbt 2023\nNum\u00e9ro du dossier :\nT2715\/9121\n[TRADUCTION FRAN\u00c7AISE]\nEntre :\nA.B.\nla plaignante\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nService canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9\nl'intim\u00e9\nD\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\nMembre :\nAthanasios Hadjis\nTable des mati\u00e8res\nI.

APER\u00c7U\n[1] L\u2019instruction de la pr\u00e9sente affaire doit commencer le 5 septembre 2023 et doit avoir lieu par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence au moyen de la plateforme Zoom. L\u2019intim\u00e9, le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (le \u00ab SCRS \u00bb), a demand\u00e9 une ordonnance afin de permettre aux employ\u00e9s et aux anciens employ\u00e9s du SCRS de t\u00e9moigner avec leur cam\u00e9ra \u00e9teinte ou de se joindre par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence en utilisant seulement la fonction audio de Zoom.\nII. D\u00c9CISION\n[2] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je rejette la requ\u00eate du SCRS et j\u2019ordonne plut\u00f4t que les t\u00e9moins en question puissent t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 huis clos en pr\u00e9sence seulement de la plaignante (\u00ab AB \u00bb), des repr\u00e9sentants du SCRS, des avocats des parties, de l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal et de moi-m\u00eame.\nIII. QUESTION EN LITIGE\n[3] Le Tribunal devrait-il rendre une ordonnance en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb) afin de permettre \u00e0 certains t\u00e9moins de t\u00e9moigner par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence avec leur cam\u00e9ra \u00e9teinte?\nIV. ANALYSE\n[4] Le 8 f\u00e9vrier 2023, j\u2019ai rendu une d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate du SCRS (AB c. Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, 2023 TCDP 5) afin d\u2019anonymiser une grande partie de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP. L\u2019article 52 pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction des plaintes est publique, mais que le membre du Tribunal peut prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019il est convaincu qu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique.\n[5] Dans cette d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, j\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 que le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, L.R.C., 1985, ch. C-23 (la \u00ab Loi sur le SCRS \u00bb) pr\u00e9voit que nul ne peut sciemment communiquer des informations qui permettraient de d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un employ\u00e9 ou d\u2019un ancien employ\u00e9 qui a particip\u00e9, participe ou pourrait vraisemblablement participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es du Service (un \u00ab employ\u00e9 de confiance du SCRS \u00bb). Dans mon analyse, j\u2019ai examin\u00e9 cette disposition, ainsi que les motifs de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans les arr\u00eats Sierra Club du Canada c. Canada (Ministre des Finances), 2002 CSC 41 [Sierra Club] et Sherman (Succession) c. Donovan, 2021 CSC 25, puis j\u2019ai tir\u00e9 les conclusions suivantes :\n1) R\u00e9v\u00e9ler l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ces employ\u00e9s poserait un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.\n2) Une ordonnance rendant anonyme leur identit\u00e9 est n\u00e9cessaire, car aucune autre mesure raisonnable ne permettrait d\u2019\u00e9carter le risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important.\n3) Les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n[6] Plus particuli\u00e8rement, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que la plaignante, qui est une ancienne employ\u00e9e de confiance du SCRS, ne soit identifi\u00e9e que par le pseudonyme \u00ab AB \u00bb. J\u2019ai aussi ordonn\u00e9 que le SCRS puisse identifier ses employ\u00e9s de confiance par des initiales choisies au hasard ou par un pseudonyme, \u00e0 condition que le titre du poste de ces employ\u00e9s soit clairement indiqu\u00e9. Enfin, j\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 que toutes les parties soient tenues de respecter la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements en ne mentionnant aucune information confidentielle lors de la proc\u00e9dure publique et en ne d\u00e9signant les employ\u00e9s de confiance du SCRS que par les initiales choisies au hasard ou les pseudonymes qui leur sont attribu\u00e9s.\n[7] Le SCRS n\u2019a pas fait de demande particuli\u00e8re quant \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re dont ces employ\u00e9s t\u00e9moigneraient. \u00c0 deux conf\u00e9rences t\u00e9l\u00e9phoniques pr\u00e9paratoires tenues dans les mois qui ont suivi la d\u00e9cision sur la requ\u00eate, il a \u00e9t\u00e9 entendu que l\u2019audience aurait lieu en personne \u00e0 Ottawa, mais qu\u2019il \u00e9tait possible que certains t\u00e9moins comparaissent par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Tous les t\u00e9moins du SCRS devaient t\u00e9moigner en personne, \u00e0 condition qu\u2019ils soient appel\u00e9s par leurs pseudonymes et que leur vrai nom ne soit pas divulgu\u00e9.\n[8] Le 19 juillet 2023, les avocats du SCRS ont envoy\u00e9 une lettre au Tribunal dans laquelle ils affirmaient que le SCRS les avait \u00ab inform\u00e9s \u00bb que ses t\u00e9moins, ainsi que la plaignante, devraient tous compara\u00eetre par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence et que leur cam\u00e9ra devrait \u00eatre \u00e9teinte en tout temps. \u00c0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue quelques jours plus tard, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que toute autre demande d\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 relative \u00e0 l\u2019instruction publique du Tribunal devrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au titre de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP.\n[9] Le 23 ao\u00fbt 2023, le SCRS a donc d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un avis de requ\u00eate en ce sens et il y a joint l\u2019affidavit d\u2019une personne identifi\u00e9e par le pseudonyme \u00ab James \u00bb, qui est un chef adjoint au sein de la Direction des litiges et divulgations du SCRS. James a offert de divulguer au Tribunal son vrai nom par acte scell\u00e9, mais je ne crois pas que ce soit n\u00e9cessaire.\n[10] Le SCRS soutient que la plaignante, les t\u00e9moins cit\u00e9s par la plaignante et tous les t\u00e9moins du SCRS, \u00e0 l\u2019exception de deux, sont des employ\u00e9s de confiance ou d\u2019anciens employ\u00e9s de confiance du SCRS. Dans ses observations, le SCRS r\u00e9it\u00e8re bon nombre de facteurs que j\u2019ai examin\u00e9s lorsque j\u2019ai rendu l\u2019ordonnance portant que les noms de ces employ\u00e9s devaient \u00eatre anonymis\u00e9s. Selon l\u2019affidavit, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de ces personnes et de leur famille pourrait \u00eatre compromise si leur identit\u00e9 \u00e9tait divulgu\u00e9e.\n[11] Cependant, le SCRS laisse maintenant entendre que l\u2019utilisation de pseudonymes n\u2019est pas suffisante. Il soutient que le visage et l\u2019image d\u2019une personne sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels de son identit\u00e9. Ainsi, les personnes qui participent \u00e0 l\u2019audience ne devraient pas pouvoir r\u00e9v\u00e9ler leur visage, leur nom ou toute autre caract\u00e9ristique permettant de les identifier.\n[12] Le SCRS soutient que mon ordonnance initiale ne suffit pas \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de ne pas divulguer l\u2019identit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s. R\u00e9v\u00e9ler leur visage reviendrait \u00e0 r\u00e9v\u00e9ler leur identit\u00e9, tout autant que leur nom. La technologie de reconnaissance faciale pourrait facilement \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e pour trouver une correspondance entre le visage des t\u00e9moins et ceux enregistr\u00e9s dans des bases de donn\u00e9es et ainsi proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l\u2019identification des t\u00e9moins. De plus, il est fort probable que l\u2019affaire soit m\u00e9diatis\u00e9e.\n[13] Le SCRS fait valoir que le paragraphe 33(2) des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137, qui pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019audience peut \u00eatre tenue en tout ou en partie par t\u00e9l\u00e9conf\u00e9rence, soit l\u2019\u00e9quivalent d\u2019utiliser la fonction audio seulement de Zoom, permet au t\u00e9moin de se faire entendre sans se faire voir. On retrouve des dispositions semblables dans les r\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure des cours f\u00e9d\u00e9rales et des cours de l\u2019Ontario.\n[14] Le SCRS a \u00e9galement fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 plusieurs d\u00e9cisions qui appuient la proposition selon laquelle des mesures devraient \u00eatre prises pour emp\u00eacher la divulgation de l\u2019identit\u00e9 des agents du SCRS. Toutefois, aucune de ces d\u00e9cisions ne traite sp\u00e9cifiquement de la question des t\u00e9moins qui comparaissent sans montrer leur visage au d\u00e9cideur et aux autres parties.\n[15] Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 dans ma premi\u00e8re d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de confiance du SCRS, ce qui renvoie \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re condition du crit\u00e8re que j\u2019ai appliqu\u00e9 et qui est \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sierra Club. Toutefois, je conclus que l\u2019ordonnance que le SCRS cherche maintenant \u00e0 obtenir ne satisfait pas \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me condition du crit\u00e8re. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, il existe une autre mesure raisonnable que celle propos\u00e9e par le SCRS qui permettrait d\u2019\u00e9carter le risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important, soit celle de tenir une audience \u00e0 huis clos et de conserver l\u2019enregistrement audio dans le dossier public.\n[16] Cette approche a \u00e9t\u00e9 propos\u00e9e lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire que j\u2019ai tenue le 24 ao\u00fbt 2023, apr\u00e8s que le SCRS eut d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa requ\u00eate, mais avant que les autres parties n\u2019aient pr\u00e9par\u00e9 leurs observations \u00e9crites. J\u2019ai alors propos\u00e9 une approche qui tenait essentiellement compte du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019AB. Le SCRS a confirm\u00e9 par la suite qu\u2019il acceptait la proposition. La plaignante et la Commission l\u2019ont \u00e9galement accept\u00e9e dans leurs observations sur la requ\u00eate.\n[17] Je proposais donc que le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019AB soit entendu \u00e0 huis clos, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les seules personnes pr\u00e9sentes \u00e0 l\u2019audience pendant son t\u00e9moignage soient les avocats de chaque partie, la plaignante, les repr\u00e9sentants du SCRS, l\u2019agent du greffe du Tribunal et moi-m\u00eame. L\u2019enregistrement num\u00e9rique de la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 huis clos serait consign\u00e9 dans le dossier officiel du Tribunal. Tous les employ\u00e9s du SCRS vis\u00e9s par mon ordonnance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente seraient d\u00e9sign\u00e9s par leur pseudonyme. Personne ne verrait son identit\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e dans l\u2019enregistrement. Ainsi, puisque l\u2019enregistrement de l\u2019audience est conserv\u00e9 dans le dossier officiel du Tribunal, accessible conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la Politique sur l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux dossiers officiels du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (TCDP), laquelle est disponible sur le site Web du Tribunal, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger l\u2019identit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 et le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est respect\u00e9.\n[18] Bien que le SCRS n\u2019ait aucune objection \u00e0 proc\u00e9der ainsi pour le t\u00e9moignage d\u2019AB, il conteste la proposition de la plaignante et de la Commission selon laquelle cette approche s\u2019appliquerait \u00e0 tous les employ\u00e9s de confiance du SCRS. Il fait valoir que la raison pour laquelle cette approche est appropri\u00e9e pour AB est que celle-ci a d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9 son nom \u00e0 la Commission et au Tribunal dans sa plainte avant qu\u2019elle ne soit anonymis\u00e9e, ce qui ne s\u2019applique pas aux autres employ\u00e9s dont l\u2019identit\u00e9 n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9e au Tribunal et aux autres avocats.\n[19] Cet argument ne me convainc pas. M\u00eame si l\u2019on applique cette approche aux autres employ\u00e9s, leurs noms ne seraient divulgu\u00e9s ni \u00e0 moi, ni \u00e0 l\u2019agent du greffe, ni aux avocats qui, en tant que membres du Barreau, sont tenus de respecter le code de d\u00e9ontologie. Je remarque que dans ma premi\u00e8re ordonnance, j\u2019ai tenu compte du fait que les descriptions de poste fournies par le SCRS pourraient ne pas suffire \u00e0 identifier un employ\u00e9 et \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer son r\u00f4le dans une situation donn\u00e9e. J\u2019ai donc ordonn\u00e9 que, dans de tels cas, le nom complet de la personne soit divulgu\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission, \u00e0 la condition que ce renseignement reste confidentiel et ne soit pas rendu public. En adoptant l\u2019approche propos\u00e9e, encore moins de renseignements leur seraient divulgu\u00e9s, car seul le visage des t\u00e9moins serait r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 et le nom resterait confidentiel. Sur ce point, il convient de souligner que le Tribunal ordonne qu\u2019il soit interdit \u00e0 quiconque d\u2019enregistrer les audiences tenues par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[20] Comme l\u2019ont fait remarquer la plaignante et la Commission, il existe des raisons imp\u00e9rieuses d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale de s\u2019assurer que les d\u00e9cideurs et les parties soient en mesure de voir le t\u00e9moin lorsqu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, la Commission a cit\u00e9 les motifs expos\u00e9s par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. N.S., 2012 CSC 72 [N.S.], dans lequel la majorit\u00e9 a conclu qu\u2019il existe un lien \u00e9troit entre la possibilit\u00e9 de voir le visage du t\u00e9moin et la tenue d\u2019un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable. La Cour a ajout\u00e9 que le fait de permettre \u00e0 la personne de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 visage voil\u00e9 peut emp\u00eacher le juge des faits d\u2019appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin. Bien que l\u2019appr\u00e9ciation visuelle du comportement du t\u00e9moin ne soit pas le seul facteur pour \u00e9valuer sa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, ni m\u00eame le plus important, les changements dans le comportement peuvent \u00eatre tr\u00e8s instructifs. Il faut \u00e9valuer si le fait de d\u00e9roger \u00e0 la pratique de voir le t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9erait un risque s\u00e9rieux d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable.\n[21] Je suis conscient que l\u2019arr\u00eat N.S. \u00e9tait une affaire de droit criminel qui traitait d\u2019all\u00e9gations d\u2019agression sexuelle. Toutefois, je pense que les commentaires de la Cour sont utiles pour traiter la question des droits de la personne dans un contexte comme celui qui nous occupe en ce moment, o\u00f9 de graves pratiques discriminatoires sont all\u00e9gu\u00e9es.\n[22] La plaignante et la Commission ont \u00e9galement fait remarquer que lorsque le Tribunal a soulev\u00e9 la question de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 des audiences en vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence pendant la pand\u00e9mie de Covid-19, il a insist\u00e9 sur le fait que les t\u00e9moins devaient compara\u00eetre \u00ab en direct \u00bb, devant le membre du Tribunal, pour que ce dernier puisse \u00ab constater les signes non-verbaux du t\u00e9moin \u00bb (Hugie c. T-Lane Transportation and Logistics, 2020 TCDP 25 au par. 28).\n[23] Je suis d\u2019accord qu\u2019il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 d\u2019importantes consid\u00e9rations et l\u2019approche propos\u00e9e les prend en compte tout en garantissant que le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est respect\u00e9 et mis en balance avec l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public \u00e0 ce que l\u2019identit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s de confiance du SCRS reste secr\u00e8te.\n[24] La requ\u00eate du SCRS soul\u00e8ve donc une autre question. En effet, ce dernier cherche \u00e0 \u00e9tendre le traitement confidentiel aux t\u00e9moignages de deux de ses employ\u00e9s qui ne sont pas directement vis\u00e9s par la d\u00e9finition \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur le SCRS. Ces personnes ne participent pas ou n\u2019ont pas particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es du SCRS. Au paragraphe 17 de mon ordonnance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente, j\u2019ai pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 que l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 ne s\u2019\u00e9tendait pas au-del\u00e0 du groupe d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s aux termes de l\u2019article 18. Par cons\u00e9quent, la Commission et la plaignante font valoir que ces t\u00e9moins devraient t\u00e9moigner publiquement, en gardant leur cam\u00e9ra allum\u00e9e.\n[25] Je remarque toutefois que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, le SCRS semble avoir utilis\u00e9 des pseudonymes pour ces personnes dans sa liste des t\u00e9moins. En fait, je ne sais pas qui des t\u00e9moins anonymes du SCRS sont ces deux personnes. \u00c0 ce jour, la Commission et la plaignante ne se sont pas oppos\u00e9es \u00e0 les inclure dans la liste des t\u00e9moins anonymes, malgr\u00e9 mon ordonnance pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente.

La d\u00e9cision sera publi\u00e9e dans les deux langues officielles une fois la traduction termin\u00e9e, conform\u00e9ment aux exigences de la Loi sur les langues officielles.\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 :\nCette affaire concerne Earl Ka-Nowpasikow, qui a eu des probl\u00e8mes avec sa maison dans une r\u00e9serve.\nM. Ka-Nowpasikow est membre de la Nation crie de Poundmaker (la \u00ab Nation \u00bb). Il habite la maison 103 de la r\u00e9serve depuis 2003. Cette maison est en tr\u00e8s mauvais \u00e9tat. Il y a des probl\u00e8mes de moisissure, de d\u00e9g\u00e2ts d\u2019eau et m\u00eame de rongeurs qui vivent \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur. Cette maison appartient \u00e0 la Nation.\nAu d\u00e9but, M. Ka-Nowpasikow vivait dans la maison avec sa femme, mais ils se sont s\u00e9par\u00e9s en 2010. Depuis la s\u00e9paration, il vit seul dans la maison. Il a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises de l\u2019aide pour r\u00e9parer sa maison et m\u00eame pour en construire une nouvelle, mais la Nation ne lui a pas vraiment r\u00e9pondu.\nM. Ka-Nowpasikow a eu l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre victime de discrimination parce qu\u2019il fait partie de la famille Tootoosis, qui n\u2019appuie pas le chef actuel de la Nation. Cependant, certains membres de la famille Tootoosis ont obtenu un nouveau logement. L\u2019appartenance \u00e0 cette famille n\u2019expliquait donc pas les probl\u00e8mes de logement de M. Ka-Nowpasikow.\nDe plus, M. Ka-Nowpasikow a trouv\u00e9 que la Nation le discriminait en raison de ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 et de son c\u00e9libat. Ses probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 comprennent des probl\u00e8mes de poumons et de dos qui l\u2019emp\u00eachent de travailler ou de se d\u00e9placer.\nLa Nation a fait valoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait pas beaucoup d\u2019argent pour les logements et qu\u2019elle l\u2019utilisait principalement pour les urgences. Le budget de logement n\u2019a pas augment\u00e9 depuis 1996 malgr\u00e9 l\u2019inflation et la croissance de la population. Le budget n\u2019est que de 296 970 $. En raison de ce budget limit\u00e9, la Nation donne la priorit\u00e9 aux logements des femmes c\u00e9libataires, des enfants et des personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es. Selon la Nation, il est normal de demander \u00e0 M. Ka-Nowpasikow de r\u00e9parer lui-m\u00eame sa maison parce qu\u2019il est c\u00e9libataire.\nCependant, le Tribunal n\u2019\u00e9tait pas d\u2019accord avec la Nation. La maison de M. Ka-Nowpasikow \u00e9tait en si mauvais \u00e9tat que la situation aggravait ses probl\u00e8mes pulmonaires. M. Ka-Nowpasikow ne pouvait donc pas r\u00e9parer la maison lui-m\u00eame en raison de son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Ka-Nowpasikow a fait l\u2019objet de discrimination parce qu\u2019il \u00e9tait un homme c\u00e9libataire atteint d\u2019une d\u00e9ficience.\nLe Tribunal a donc ordonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la Nation de verser 10 000 $ \u00e0 M. Ka-Nowpasikow pour pr\u00e9judice moral. Il a \u00e9galement ordonn\u00e9 le versement de 5 000 $ parce que la Nation n\u2019avait pas correctement tenu compte de la situation de M. Ka-Nowpasikow lorsqu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 de l\u2019aide pour son logement. Le Tribunal a aussi demand\u00e9 aux deux parties de collaborer pour trouver un moyen d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la situation de M. Ka-Nowpasikow en mati\u00e8re de logement.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nIl n'y a pas de document disponible pour cette d\u00e9cision.",

Selon la premi\u00e8re plainte, le Service correctionnel du Canada (SCC) discrimine toutes les femmes qui purgent une peine f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, et ce, en raison de :\n\u2022 ses outils de classification de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9valuation du risque;\n\u2022 son recours \u00e0 la s\u00e9gr\u00e9gation, \u00e0 l\u2019isolement et \u00e0 des conditions de d\u00e9tention restrictives;\n\u2022 ses services et programmes en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 mentale.\nSelon la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, le SCC fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de toutes les femmes autochtones qui purgent une peine f\u00e9d\u00e9rale lorsqu\u2019il leur refuse l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux pratiques spirituelles, culturelles et sociales des Autochtones.\nEn 2019, le SCC a mis en place une nouvelle m\u00e9thode de gestion des d\u00e9tenus qui ne peuvent pas rester dans la population carc\u00e9rale g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Cette m\u00e9thode consiste \u00e0 remplacer l\u2019\u00ab isolement pr\u00e9ventif \u00bb par des \u00ab unit\u00e9s d\u2019intervention structur\u00e9es \u00bb (UIS). L\u2019ACSEF et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) affirment que m\u00eame avec la mise en place des UIS, le SCC continue de faire preuve de discrimination (voir la d\u00e9cision 2022 TCDP 12, dans laquelle le Tribunal autorise des modifications aux expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties).\nLa Commission veut maintenant que le SCC partage les documents relatifs aux UIS et les mises \u00e0 jour relatives \u00e0 d\u2019autres documents de politique. La Commission a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait besoin de ces documents pour \u00e9valuer les conditions des femmes purgeant une peine f\u00e9d\u00e9rale depuis 2019. Le SCC a soutenu que les demandes \u00e9taient inutiles ou d\u00e9raisonnablement larges.\nLe Tribunal a examin\u00e9 si les documents demand\u00e9s pourraient \u00eatre pertinents. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement examin\u00e9 si la demande \u00e9tablissait un juste \u00e9quilibre entre le droit des parties \u00e0 faire valoir leurs arguments et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir une proc\u00e9dure efficace et \u00e9quitable. Le Tribunal s\u2019est dit tr\u00e8s inquiet relativement \u00e0 l\u2019effet que pourrait avoir la demande de la Commission sur le d\u00e9roulement de l\u2019instruction. Le Tribunal a \u00e9galement not\u00e9 que les documents contiennent des renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels et d\u00e9licats sur des personnes qui ne participent pas \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Aucun individu n\u2019a choisi de participer \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e0 titre de partie plaignante.\nLe Tribunal a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 d\u2019examiner un \u00e9chantillon de documents. Il a demand\u00e9 au SCC de discuter avec l\u2019ACSEF et la Commission au sujet des documents qui seront compris dans l\u2019\u00e9chantillon \u00e0 fournir par le SCC. Le Tribunal a aussi demand\u00e9 aux parties de collaborer \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9laboration d\u2019une proposition sur les divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires. La proposition doit recommander des mesures visant \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les int\u00e9r\u00eats des femmes concern\u00e9es qui purgent une peine f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. Le Tribunal examinera l\u2019\u00e9chantillon de documents et la proposition. Il planifiera ensuite une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire pour discuter des prochaines \u00e9tapes.\nLe Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 au SCC de communiquer ce qui suit :\n\u2022 des donn\u00e9es statistiques agr\u00e9g\u00e9es sur les UIS dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes;\n\u2022 dix d\u00e9cisions non caviard\u00e9es de d\u00e9cideurs externes ind\u00e9pendants concernant les UIS;\n\u2022 dix dossiers non caviard\u00e9s concernant quelques mesures prises \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019individus (voir les paragraphes 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) et 37.3(4) de la Loi sur le syst\u00e8me correctionnel et la mise en libert\u00e9 sous condition, L.C. 1992, ch. 20);\n\u2022 les politiques et proc\u00e9dures actuelles sur lesquelles le SCC a l\u2019intention de s\u2019appuyer dans le cadre de cette enqu\u00eate.\nAfin de prot\u00e9ger les femmes vis\u00e9es par ces dossiers, le Tribunal a ordonn\u00e9 que tout document communiqu\u00e9 ne soit utilis\u00e9 qu\u2019aux fins de la divulgation et demeure confidentiel jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le Tribunal donne d\u2019autres directives. Les parties peuvent pr\u00e9senter une requ\u00eate en confidentialit\u00e9 avant de pr\u00e9senter leur proposition conjointe sur les divulgations suppl\u00e9mentaires ou peuvent, au plus tard, en pr\u00e9senter une avec leur proposition.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence :\n2023 TCDP 39\nDate : le\n7 septembre 2023\nNum\u00e9ros des dossiers :\nT1848\/7812; T1849\/7912\nEntre :\nASSOCIATION CANADIENNE DES SOCI\u00c9T\u00c9S ELIZABETH FRY\nla plaignante\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nSERVICE CORRECTIONNEL CANADA\nl'intim\u00e9\n- et -\nASSOCIATION DES FEMMES AUTOCHTONES DU CANADA\nla partie interess\u00e9e\nD\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\nMembre :\nJennifer Khurana\nI.

H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). Ces plaintes ne sont pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9es pour le compte de femmes en particulier et aucune mesure de r\u00e9paration pour un acte pr\u00e9cis de discrimination all\u00e9gu\u00e9e n\u2019est demand\u00e9e.\n[2] La premi\u00e8re plainte porte sur des all\u00e9gations de discrimination relatives \u00e0 des outils de classement selon le niveau de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9valuation des risques, au recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement, aux conditions d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration restrictives, au d\u00e9faut d\u2019offrir un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des soins de sant\u00e9 mentale et \u00e0 des mesures d\u2019adaptation appropri\u00e9es, ainsi qu\u2019au refus d\u2019offrir un acc\u00e8s \u00e0 des programmes. Dans la deuxi\u00e8me plainte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au nom des femmes autochtones purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 que SCC leur refuse l\u2019acc\u00e8s aux pratiques spirituelles, culturelles et sociales des Autochtones, notamment en ce qui concerne l\u2019exp\u00e9rience particuli\u00e8re v\u00e9cue par des femmes autochtones qui ont re\u00e7u une cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 trop \u00e9lev\u00e9e et qui sont plac\u00e9es en isolement.\n[3] Le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement pr\u00e9ventif a \u00e9t\u00e9 aboli en 2019 lorsque la Loi sur le syst\u00e8me correctionnel et la mise en libert\u00e9 sous condition, L.C. 1992, ch. 20 (la \u00ab LSCMLC \u00bb) a fait l\u2019objet de modifications. Le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral a mis en place les unit\u00e9s d\u2019intervention structur\u00e9e (les \u00ab UIS \u00bb) afin de pouvoir g\u00e9rer les d\u00e9tenus qui ne peuvent pas rester dans la population carc\u00e9rale r\u00e9guli\u00e8re. \u00c0 la suite de ces modifications, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) et l\u2019ACSEF ont demand\u00e9 de mettre \u00e0 jour leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions afin d\u2019y ajouter des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles les UIS perp\u00e9tuent la discrimination exerc\u00e9e sous le r\u00e9gime de l\u2019isolement pr\u00e9ventif, particuli\u00e8rement envers les d\u00e9linquantes ayant des troubles de sant\u00e9 mentale, qu\u2019elles soient autochtones ou non. Dans la d\u00e9cision Association canadienne des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Elizabeth Fry c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2022 TCDP 12 (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux UIS \u00bb), j\u2019ai autoris\u00e9 la Commission et l\u2019ACSEF \u00e0 mettre \u00e0 jour leurs expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions apr\u00e8s avoir conclu qu\u2019il existe un lien suffisant entre les modifications propos\u00e9es et les plaintes initiales, qui traitaient des all\u00e9gations li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019effet discriminatoire continu de l\u2019isolement sur les d\u00e9tenues.\n[4] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate afin que le Tribunal ordonne au SCC de produire les documents li\u00e9s aux UIS ainsi que les mises \u00e0 jour des autres documents de politique. La Commission a l\u2019intention d\u2019appeler une experte, Dr Kelly Hannah-Moffat, \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner notamment au sujet des UIS. Selon la Commission, Dr Hannah-Moffat a besoin de documents pour \u00e9valuer les conditions d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration depuis la mise en \u0153uvre des UIS.\n[5] SCC demande au Tribunal de rejeter la requ\u00eate et fait valoir que les demandes sont injustifi\u00e9es et excessivement larges. Il soutient \u00e9galement que la divulgation des dossiers personnels que l\u2019\u00e9tablissement tient sur les d\u00e9linquantes dans les UIS soul\u00e8ve des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de protection des renseignements personnels et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la nature tr\u00e8s personnelle et d\u00e9licate des renseignements contenus dans les documents demand\u00e9s. SCC offre de produire un nombre raisonnable de dossiers de femmes qui consentent \u00e0 la communication de leurs renseignements personnels. Il fait valoir qu\u2019une communication limit\u00e9e facilitera la gestion des proc\u00e9dures qui sont d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u2019une ampleur exceptionnelle, surtout si l\u2019on tient compte du fait que plus de 67 000 documents ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 produits dans le cadre de ces plaintes.\n[6] L\u2019ACSEF convient avec la Commission que SCC tente de r\u00e9duire ind\u00fbment l\u2019\u00e9tendue des plaintes dans le cadre du processus de divulgation.\n[7] J\u2019ai pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 ci-dessous mes ordonnances concernant les prochaines \u00e9tapes du pr\u00e9sent dossier. De plus, j\u2019encourage fortement les parties \u00e0 amorcer des discussions en vue d\u2019un r\u00e8glement \u00e0 l\u2019amiable, soit entre elles ou en ayant recours \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par le Tribunal ou \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de m\u00e9diation-arbitrage.\nII. QUESTION EN LITIGE [8] Le Tribunal devrait-il ordonner la production des documents que la Commission demande de la mani\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9e dans sa requ\u00eate et dans sa r\u00e9plique?\nIII. D\u00c9CISION [9] Oui, mais en partie seulement. J\u2019examinerai les donn\u00e9es agr\u00e9g\u00e9es qui seront produites et un \u00e9chantillon des dossiers demand\u00e9s avant de donner d\u2019autres instructions sur la mani\u00e8re de proc\u00e9der.\n[10] Je ne suis pas convaincue que la production des dossiers personnels de chacune des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e dans une UIS, avec tous les d\u00e9tails qu\u2019ils contiennent, est n\u00e9cessaire pour que l\u2019ACSEF et la Commission puissent pr\u00e9senter \u00e9quitablement leur position. Accueillir les demandes de la Commission dans leur int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 aura une incidence sur la capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 instruire cette affaire efficacement et en temps opportun. De plus, j\u2019ai des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des femmes vis\u00e9es par ces plaintes. Celles-ci n\u2019ont pas choisi de participer \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instance et si j\u2019ordonne la production de leurs dossiers personnels comme le demande la Commission, des renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels seront divulgu\u00e9s.\n[11] SCC produira les donn\u00e9es agr\u00e9g\u00e9es qu\u2019il a offert de communiquer, ainsi qu\u2019un petit nombre de dossiers personnels, tel qu\u2019\u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci-dessous. Les parties travailleront ensemble et s\u2019entendront sur un \u00e9chantillon de dossiers que SCC soumettra aux avocats et au Tribunal. Ces dossiers ne seront divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 aucun t\u00e9moin \u00e9ventuel ni \u00e0 qui que ce soit d\u2019autre, y compris \u00e0 la partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le Tribunal rende une nouvelle ordonnance.\n[12] Une fois que j\u2019aurai examin\u00e9 les dossiers, je convoquerai les parties \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion pr\u00e9paratoire juste avant laquelle elles devront pr\u00e9senter une proposition conjointe sur la divulgation de tout autre dossier personnel. Les parties exposeront leur proposition pour prot\u00e9ger les renseignements personnels et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des femmes vis\u00e9es par ces plaintes. J\u2019examinerai les documents et la proposition des parties avant de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a lieu d\u2019ordonner la production d\u2019autres documents et, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, sous quelle forme.\n[13] Je sugg\u00e8re aussi fortement aux parties de reconsid\u00e9rer la possibilit\u00e9 de recourir \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation ou \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de m\u00e9diation-arbitrage au lieu de s\u2019engager dans un litige qui s\u2019annonce long et co\u00fbteux et qui risque de s\u2019\u00e9tirer sur plusieurs ann\u00e9es. Si les parties collaborent pour r\u00e9soudre tout ou partie des questions soulev\u00e9es dans ces plaintes, elles pourront avancer bien plus rapidement. Elles pourront \u00e9galement envisager diverses options cr\u00e9atives dans le cadre de plaintes qui visent \u00e0 obtenir un changement syst\u00e9mique et une r\u00e9forme politique \u00e0 grande \u00e9chelle. Les parties pourront arriver avec des solutions cr\u00e9atives qui vont au-del\u00e0 de ce que le Tribunal serait \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019ordonner si l\u2019ACSEF r\u00e9ussissait \u00e0 \u00e9tablir la discrimination.\nIV. LES DEMANDES DE LA COMMISSION [14] La Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate en production de documents afin d\u2019obtenir plusieurs cat\u00e9gories de documents. Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 la r\u00e9ponse de SCC, j\u2019ai convi\u00e9 les parties \u00e0 une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion pr\u00e9paratoire parce qu\u2019il semblait que SCC ne contestait pas la production de certains des documents demand\u00e9s. J\u2019ai aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 l\u2019ACSEF de r\u00e9pondre express\u00e9ment aux arguments de SCC quant \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels, \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, \u00e0 la proportionnalit\u00e9 et \u00e0 la prolongation de la proc\u00e9dure.\n[15] J\u2019ai ordonn\u00e9 aux parties de cr\u00e9er un tableau r\u00e9capitulatif des demandes en suspens de la Commission et d\u2019y ajouter les raisons pour lesquelles SCC s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la production des documents demand\u00e9s ainsi que les r\u00e9pliques de l\u2019ACSEF et de la Commission. Je leur ai demand\u00e9 d\u2019y indiquer le temps et les ressources que SCC estime devoir consacrer \u00e0 la production des documents demand\u00e9s.\n[16] \u00c0 ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la Commission a joint l\u2019affidavit de la t\u00e9moin experte qu\u2019elle entend citer, ainsi qu\u2019une nouvelle annexe A \u00e9non\u00e7ant les mesures de r\u00e9paration subsidiaires sollicit\u00e9es. Au vu de l\u2019affidavit et des nouvelles mesures sollicit\u00e9es dans les observations en r\u00e9plique, SCC a demand\u00e9 l\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser une br\u00e8ve contre-r\u00e9plique, et la Commission a alors d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une contre-r\u00e9plique suppl\u00e9mentaire.\n[17] Je ne traiterai pas de chacun des arguments avanc\u00e9s par les parties dans les documents li\u00e9s \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. En fait, je n\u2019ai examin\u00e9 que ceux qui me permettaient de d\u00e9terminer la voie \u00e0 suivre \u00e0 ce stade de la proc\u00e9dure.\nA. Les demandes de la Commission\n[18] La Commission sollicite une ordonnance du Tribunal pour les quatre cat\u00e9gories de documents suivantes :\nToutes les donn\u00e9es et tous les dossiers que SCC a communiqu\u00e9s au Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur la mise en \u0153uvre (le \u00ab CCMO \u00bb) au sujet des \u00e9tablissements pour femmes, et toutes les demandes de renseignement faites par le CCMO \u00e0 SCC.\nLes d\u00e9cisions que les d\u00e9cideurs externes ind\u00e9pendants (les \u00ab DEI \u00bb) ont rendues \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des UIS dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes depuis le 30 novembre 2019.\nLes registres tenus dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes en application des paragraphes 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) et 37.3(4) de la LSCMLC.\nLes documents importants sur lesquels SCC compte se fonder dans ses expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions et \u00e0 l\u2019audience, en se concentrant particuli\u00e8rement sur les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures actuelles.\n[19] Dans une annexe jointe \u00e0 sa r\u00e9plique, la Commission sollicite une mesure de r\u00e9paration subsidiaire. Elle demande que SCC communique les renseignements personnels de chaque d\u00e9linquante transf\u00e9r\u00e9e dans les UIS des \u00e9tablissements pour femmes, notamment les renseignements sur son \u00e9tat de sant\u00e9 mentale, sur toute tentative de suicide et sur les interactions personnelles qu\u2019elle a eues pendant sa d\u00e9tention dans l\u2019UIS. Selon la Commission, cette liste reprend essentiellement les renseignements dont son experte aurait besoin pour pr\u00e9parer son rapport. Pour \u00e9tayer le bien-fond\u00e9 de sa demande, la Commission a joint \u00e0 ses observations en r\u00e9plique l\u2019affidavit de la Dr Hannah-Moffat.\nV. ANALYSE [20] Les parties doivent avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve (par. 50(1) de la Loi). \u00c0 cette fin, chaque partie a le droit que les documents potentiellement pertinents qui se trouvent en la possession de l\u2019autre partie lui soient communiqu\u00e9s de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 lui permettre de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et, ainsi, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019instruction (Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2019 TCDP 8, au par. 4). Les R\u00e8gles du Tribunal exigent que les parties fournissent une copie de tous les documents qu\u2019ils ont en leur possession relativement \u00e0 un fait ou \u00e0 une question soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte, ou \u00e0 une ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e par une partie (article 23 des R\u00e8gles). Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une obligation de communication continue (SM et al. c. GRC, 2022 TCDP 11, au par. 11 et article 24 des R\u00e8gles).\n[21] Le crit\u00e8re applicable \u00e0 la divulgation est celui de la pertinence potentielle, ce qui n\u2019est pas un crit\u00e8re particuli\u00e8rement exigeant. La partie qui demande la production d\u2019un document doit d\u00e9montrer l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien rationnel entre le document et les questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte (voir, par exemple, T.P. c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 2019 TCDP 19, au par. 11 [T.P.], et Turner c. Agence des services frontaliers du Canada, 2018 TCDP 1, au par. 30 [Turner]). La demande de divulgation ne doit cependant pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ni \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache (Egan c. Agence du revenu du Canada, 2017 TCDP 33, aux par. 31 et 32 [Egan] et Turner, au par. 30).\n[22] Au-del\u00e0 de la pertinence potentielle, le Tribunal doit \u00e9galement tenir compte des autres int\u00e9r\u00eats possibles, comme la confidentialit\u00e9 et les privil\u00e8ges. Il se peut que la divulgation de documents potentiellement pertinents soit refus\u00e9e ou soit assortie de conditions s\u2019il existe des privil\u00e8ges ou des pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e. Pour prot\u00e9ger la vie priv\u00e9e d\u2019une partie, le Tribunal peut prendre diff\u00e9rentes mesures, notamment en limitant la communication ou en l\u2019assortissant de conditions. (Voir White c. Laboratoires Nucl\u00e9aires Canadiens, 2020 TCDP, au par. 9-10; T.P., au par. 37, Egan, aux par. 34 et 50 et Yaffa c. Air Canada, 2014 TCDP 22, au par. 12).\n[23] Bien que le crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle soit peu exigeant, il vise \u00e0 emp\u00eacher qu\u2019on se lance dans des demandes de production qui reposent sur la conjecture et qui sont fantaisistes, perturbatrices, mal fond\u00e9es, obstructionnistes et dilatoires (Brickner c. la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2017 TCDP 28, au par. 5).\nA. La pertinence potentielle [24] Je conviens que les documents demand\u00e9s sont potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement et les conditions de d\u00e9tention restrictive ont un effet n\u00e9faste sur les d\u00e9linquantes qui ont des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale, qu\u2019elles soient autochtones ou non. Le crit\u00e8re de la pertinence potentielle est peu exigeant et la port\u00e9e des plaintes est large. J\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique li\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019isolement et aux conditions d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration restrictives s\u2019inscrivent dans la pr\u00e9sente instance depuis le d\u00e9but (d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux UIS, aux par. 17 \u00e0 30). Il n\u2019est pas difficile de conclure \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019un lien rationnel entre les documents demand\u00e9s au sujet des UIS et les plaintes. En effet, les plaintes sont de nature syst\u00e9mique, mettent en cause plusieurs motifs et comprennent quatre grandes cat\u00e9gories d\u2019all\u00e9gations qui se rapportent \u00e0 de nombreux aspects des conditions carc\u00e9rales de toutes les femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au Canada, y compris le recours \u00e0 l\u2019isolement et les conditions de d\u00e9tention restrictives.\n[25] Cependant, la pertinence potentielle n\u2019est pas l\u2019unique facteur \u00e0 prendre en compte. Le processus d\u2019audience doit \u00eatre \u00e9quitable, \u00e9quilibr\u00e9 et proportionn\u00e9. J\u2019ai \u00e9galement des r\u00e9serves en ce qui concerne la protection des renseignements personnels et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des d\u00e9linquantes dont le dossier serait divulgu\u00e9 et qui ne sont pas parties \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente proc\u00e9dure.\nB. La proportionnalit\u00e9 [26] SCC soutient que l\u2019ACSEF et la Commission traitent la pr\u00e9sente affaire comme s\u2019il s\u2019agissait de plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par 89 personnes diff\u00e9rentes, mais sans nommer aucune victime ou plaignante en particulier. Selon lui, on ne peut pas pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019une plainte est \u00ab syst\u00e9mique \u00bb dans le but d\u2019\u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de la production de documents d\u2019une mani\u00e8re qui s\u2019apparente \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache et de recueillir ainsi des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur toutes les d\u00e9linquantes de tous les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes de partout au Canada \u00e0 tout moment depuis 2011 ou avant. Il soutient que le temps et les ressources n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la production de ces documents sont disproportionn\u00e9s par rapport \u00e0 leur valeur potentielle et auront pour effet de ralentir une proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9j\u00e0 lente.\n[27] La Commission dit que ses demandes n\u2019\u00e9quivalent pas \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache, car il existe d\u00e9j\u00e0 des renseignements publics qui laissent croire que les femmes autochtones sont surrepr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans les UIS. Elle affirme que les donn\u00e9es sur les UIS montreront les r\u00e9sultats de ce syst\u00e8me et prouveront que les femmes autochtones purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral souffrent particuli\u00e8rement des cons\u00e9quences des UIS.\n[28] Selon SCC, certains de ces documents ne sont pas potentiellement pertinents ou le sont tr\u00e8s peu, et le principe de proportionnalit\u00e9 exige que tous les acteurs impliqu\u00e9s dans le syst\u00e8me de justice agissent de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 r\u00e9duire au minimum le temps et les co\u00fbts li\u00e9s aux proc\u00e9dures judiciaires. Le principe de la proportionnalit\u00e9 pourrait aussi justifier que des limites soient impos\u00e9es (Temate c. Agence de sant\u00e9 publique du Canada, 2022 TCDP 31, aux par. 8 \u00e0 16). Il soutient que la Commission cherche en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 \u00e0 obtenir les dossiers personnels de chacune des 89 d\u00e9linquantes ou plus qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans l\u2019UIS d\u2019un \u00e9tablissement pour femmes dans le cadre d\u2019au moins 149 transf\u00e8rements diff\u00e9rents depuis la mise en \u0153uvre des UIS en 2019.\n[29] Selon SCC, les parties devraient collaborer en vue de favoriser, dans la mesure du possible, une instruction \u00e9quitable, efficace et rapide. Je suis du m\u00eame avis. La Commission et l\u2019ACSEF ne m\u2019ont pas convaincue que leur approche permettait d\u2019\u00e9tablir un juste \u00e9quilibre entre leur droit de d\u00e9fendre leur cause et les imp\u00e9ratifs d\u2019efficacit\u00e9 et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Comme je l\u2019indiquerai ci-dessous, j\u2019ai plut\u00f4t des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[30] La Commission soutient que ses demandes sont pr\u00e9cises et proportionn\u00e9es, et que le nombre de femmes plac\u00e9es dans les UIS est faible. Elle fait valoir que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et le processus d\u2019enqu\u00eate demandent que SCC alloue les ressources n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 la communication de ces donn\u00e9es.\n[31] Selon l\u2019ACSEF, il serait inappropri\u00e9 que le Tribunal permette \u00e0 SCC de transformer la discrimination syst\u00e9mique en discrimination individuelle en imposant une limite \u00e0 la production de documents potentiellement pertinents. L\u2019ACSEF se fonde sur la d\u00e9cision Desmarais c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2014 TCDP 5 [Desmarais], dans laquelle le Tribunal a conclu qu\u2019il doit tenir compte de la preuve de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de d\u00e9tenus atteints de d\u00e9ficience intellectuelle. En se fondant sur Canada (Human Rights Commission) c. Canada (Department of National Health and Welfare), 1998 CanLII 7740 (CF), aux par. 17 \u00e0 22, l\u2019ACSEF soutient \u00e9galement que le Tribunal commettrait une erreur de droit s\u2019il refusait de prendre en consid\u00e9ration la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique.\n[32] La d\u00e9cision Desmarais ne m\u2019est d\u2019aucune aide. Dans cette d\u00e9cision, SCC cherchait \u00e0 obtenir la radiation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de l\u2019instruction portant sur la discrimination syst\u00e9mique et demandait que la divulgation des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve relatifs aux all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique soit limit\u00e9e aux documents qui d\u00e9finissaient la situation dans laquelle se trouvait le plaignant au moment o\u00f9 il purgeait sa peine sous la surveillance de SCC. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, SCC a consenti \u00e0 produire des donn\u00e9es agr\u00e9g\u00e9es et un \u00e9chantillon de dossiers plut\u00f4t que l\u2019ensemble des dossiers tenus par les \u00e9tablissements pour chacune des d\u00e9linquantes vis\u00e9es par ces plaintes.\n[33] En outre, je ne refuse pas d\u2019ordonner la production d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique ou de les prendre en compte. Je conviens que toutes les pratiques, les politiques, les statistiques et les donn\u00e9es sont susceptibles de d\u00e9montrer une constante dans la conduite, comme le d\u00e9montre mon ordonnance ci-dessous. Toutefois, je dois trouver une mani\u00e8re de contenir ce qui pourrait devenir une proc\u00e9dure impossible \u00e0 g\u00e9rer si aucune limite n\u2019est fix\u00e9e et si aucune directive n\u2019est donn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la gestion de l\u2019instance.\n[34] J\u2019accepte les observations de la Commission et de l\u2019ACSEF selon lesquelles ces demandes sont fond\u00e9es. J\u2019accepte \u00e9galement l\u2019observation de l\u2019ACSEF selon laquelle le r\u00f4le du Tribunal consiste \u00e0 instruire les plaintes que la Commission lui renvoie (paragraphes 49(1) et 49(2) de la Loi), y compris les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, et que le Tribunal peut rendre des ordonnances pour pr\u00e9venir la discrimination s\u2019il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que la plainte est fond\u00e9e. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le pouvoir de contr\u00f4ler le nombre de plaintes que la Commission lui renvoie pour instruction ni la nature de ces plaintes. Cependant, je ne suis pas d\u2019accord pour dire qu\u2019il est inappropri\u00e9 de limiter la divulgation simplement parce qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de plaintes syst\u00e9miques sans plaignant individuel.\n[35] Le l\u00e9gislateur a choisi de d\u00e9l\u00e9guer la prise de d\u00e9cisions dans des domaines sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9s comme les droits de la personne aux tribunaux administratifs et s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019ils rendent leurs d\u00e9cisions promptement et efficacement (Dorey et al. c. Emploi et D\u00e9veloppement social Canada, 2023 TCDP 23, aux par. 28, 32, citant Law Society of Saskatchewan c. Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29, aux par. 46 et 64). Instruire les plaintes sans formalisme et de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique est non seulement appropri\u00e9, mais c\u2019est une obligation en vertu du paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi. En outre, il revient \u00e0 l\u2019arbitre d\u2019imposer des limites raisonnables \u00e0 la divulgation pour assurer le bon fonctionnement du Tribunal et pour fournir des directives dans le cadre de la gestion de cas. Le fait que la discrimination soit qualifi\u00e9e de \u00ab syst\u00e9mique \u00bb ne signifie pas que les r\u00e8gles changent ou que le processus accusatoire se transforme en commission royale.\n[36] En outre, il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public, ni dans celui des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au nom desquelles ces plaintes sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es, de faire abstraction du fait que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas le mandat de mener des instances qui ne sont assorties d\u2019aucune limite \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la communication de la preuve ou \u00e0 toute autre \u00e9tape, ni du fait qu\u2019il ne dispose pas non plus des ressources n\u00e9cessaires \u00e0 cette fin. Faire fi de cette r\u00e9alit\u00e9 aurait pour effet de paralyser le Tribunal et d\u2019\u00e9puiser ses ressources d\u00e9j\u00e0 limit\u00e9es, ce qui aurait des cons\u00e9quences non seulement sur la pr\u00e9sente instruction, mais sur toutes les autres parties qui attendent que leur plainte soit instruite et tranch\u00e9e. Une telle situation ne sert pas l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et ne fait pas avancer les objectifs de la Loi que je suis tenue d\u2019appliquer. La recherche de positions communes, la collaboration et la gestion d\u2019instance efficace sont n\u00e9cessaires au bon fonctionnement et \u00e0 la stabilit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice, notamment au sein du Tribunal. Toutes les parties devront faire des choix dans le cadre du pr\u00e9sent litige, et je leur donnerai des instructions \u00e0 cet effet au cours de l\u2019instance. Par exemple, les parties devaient pr\u00e9senter toute autre demande de divulgation d\u2019une fa\u00e7on proportionn\u00e9e (d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative aux UIS, au par. 10)\n[37] Je reconnais l\u2019importance de la divulgation pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience lorsque tous les documents sont entre les mains d\u2019une seule partie. En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, tous les documents qui se rapportent aux femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral sont sous la garde et le contr\u00f4le de SCC. Je reconnais \u00e9galement que la communication pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience doit \u00eatre proportionnelle \u00e0 la nature et \u00e0 la complexit\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire. Les questions sous-jacentes aux pr\u00e9sentes plaintes rev\u00eatent une grande importance pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public et ont trait \u00e0 des all\u00e9gations sur les conditions carc\u00e9rales des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Cependant, une gestion inad\u00e9quate de l\u2019instance n\u2019aidera pas \u00e0 la prise de d\u00e9cision ou \u00e0 la r\u00e9solution efficace de l\u2019affaire.\n[38] Je dois \u00e9galement mettre en balance la valeur probante des documents demand\u00e9s avec le temps, le co\u00fbt et les autres int\u00e9r\u00eats en cause dans la production de ces documents, dont l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. J\u2019ai \u00e9nonc\u00e9 des param\u00e8tres et donn\u00e9 des directives dans mes conclusions ci-dessous pour chaque cat\u00e9gorie de documents que la Commission demande.\nC. Les pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de protection des renseignements personnels et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 [39] SCC soutient que, pour des raisons de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les dossiers personnels tenus par les \u00e9tablissements ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s sans au moins que les d\u00e9linquantes en soient avis\u00e9es ou qu\u2019elles consentent \u00e0 la divulgation de renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels. Dans sa r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, SCC a joint l\u2019affidavit de Mme Marie-France Lapierre, directrice du Secteur des d\u00e9linquantes. Mme Lapierre fait observer que la production de ces dossiers pourrait poser un risque \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 si les d\u00e9linquantes sont identifiables, et ce, surtout en raison du petit nombre de femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au Canada, du nombre encore plus petit de femmes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans une UIS et du fait que les renseignements qui s\u2019y trouvent sont tr\u00e8s personnels. Elle affirme que le caviardage des donn\u00e9es et des documents des d\u00e9linquantes exige une tr\u00e8s grande expertise. De plus, SCC dit que les documents li\u00e9s aux UIS contiennent tellement de renseignements personnels \u00e0 propos des femmes et d\u2019autres personnes, dont les membres de leur famille, que les caviarder les rendrait illisibles.\n[40] La Commission et l\u2019ACSEF pr\u00e9tendent qu\u2019il n\u2019existe aucune obligation d\u2019obtenir le consentement des 89 femmes en cause. Selon elles, la dispense pr\u00e9vue aux alin\u00e9as 8(2)c) et d) de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels s\u2019applique parce que sous le r\u00e9gime des R\u00e8gles du Tribunal, SCC est tenu de communiquer ces documents et parce que SCC est repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par le Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada. En outre, la Commission fait valoir que si SCC croit devoir obtenir le consentement des femmes, il devrait d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00eatre en train de le leur demander.\n[41] L\u2019ACSEF soutient \u00e9galement qu\u2019il lui est pratiquement impossible d\u2019obtenir le consentement des femmes dans les UIS comme le propose SCC parce qu\u2019elle ne les conna\u00eet pas et ne peut pas entrer en contact avec elles, \u00e0 moins que SCC divulgue leur identit\u00e9 et lui permette de les rencontrer dans les UIS. Enfin, elle dit que la peur de repr\u00e9sailles dissuade les femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de participer aux proc\u00e9dures judiciaires, particuli\u00e8rement les femmes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9tenues dans une UIS. Elle soutient que leur droit \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e peut \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9 gr\u00e2ce au caviardage et ne devrait pas \u00eatre utilis\u00e9 comme un motif pour refuser de produire des renseignements potentiellement pertinents aux autres parties.\n[42] La Commission dit que, pour acc\u00e9l\u00e9rer le processus de divulgation, elle renoncera aux noms des femmes et \u00e0 d\u2019autres renseignements personnels qui ne sont pas pertinents et acceptera que les documents ne soient que minimalement caviard\u00e9s. Elle s\u2019engage \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger les renseignements personnels et les utilisera uniquement dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la r\u00e8gle de l\u2019engagement implicite. Bien que SCC ait \u00e9labor\u00e9 une liste de renseignements qui lui semblent personnels et qui ne devraient pas \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s, la Commission s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que SCC les retienne, car elle affirme en avoir besoin pour faire valoir sa th\u00e8se.\n[43] Bien que je convienne avec l\u2019ACSEF qu\u2019obtenir le consentement des femmes pour avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 leur dossier pose un d\u00e9fi, je ne suis pas dispos\u00e9e \u00e0 ordonner la production d\u2019un si grand nombre de documents sans examiner attentivement les besoins de ces femmes en ce qui concerne la protection des renseignements personnels et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9. Je reconnais que je dois tenir compte de la Loi sur la protection des renseignements personnels, sur laquelle la Commission et l\u2019ACSEF s\u2019appuient, mais je dois aussi garder \u00e0 l\u2019esprit la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et la protection des renseignements personnels de ces femmes qui n\u2019ont aucune voix dans cette affaire. Il est possible qu\u2019elles ne sachent pas que leurs ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents personnels et m\u00e9dicaux, y compris les tentatives de suicide et d\u2019autres renseignements profond\u00e9ment personnels \u00e0 leur sujet \u2014 et m\u00eame au sujet de membres de leur famille \u2014, risquent d\u2019\u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s au t\u00e9moin expert, aux autres parties et au Tribunal. Tant l\u2019ACSEF que la Commission ont formul\u00e9 des commentaires quant \u00e0 la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral.\n[44] \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la nature des renseignements demand\u00e9s, qui comprennent des d\u00e9tails sur les risques de suicide et sur les ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents psychologiques et m\u00e9dicaux des femmes, je ne souscris pas \u00e0 l\u2019argument de la Commission selon lequel ces craintes sont purement hypoth\u00e9tiques. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de simples r\u00e9flexions faites par les avocats. SCC a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 l\u2019affidavit de Mme Lapierre. Cette derni\u00e8re travaille \u00e0 SCC avec les femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral et s\u2019appuie sur son exp\u00e9rience pour justifier ces craintes, que je ne suis pas pr\u00eate \u00e0 ignorer.\n[45] Il est vrai que nous ne sommes qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tape de la communication pr\u00e9alable et qu\u2019\u00e0 mesure que l\u2019instruction progressera, il est possible que j\u2019ordonne des mesures de confidentialit\u00e9. Toutefois, avant que tout dossier ne soit communiqu\u00e9 plus largement, je dois trouver le moyen de bien concilier les besoins des femmes vis\u00e9es dans cette instance tout en tenant compte des traumatismes. Je commencerai par examiner quelques documents et par entendre les parties avant de d\u00e9cider de la marche \u00e0 suivre. Je n\u2019ordonnerai pas une divulgation aussi large des dossiers personnels tenus par l\u2019\u00e9tablissement sans d\u2019abord avoir la garantie de ne pas causer plus de tort \u00e0 des personnes qui n\u2019ont pas intent\u00e9 cette poursuite elles-m\u00eames et dont la vie est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par d\u2019autres.\n[46] Une des plaintes a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e au nom des femmes autochtones purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. La partie int\u00e9ress\u00e9e, l\u2019Association des femmes autochtones du Canada, pourrait peut-\u00eatre aussi \u00eatre en mesure d\u2019offrir son point de vue et son expertise sur la meilleure fa\u00e7on de r\u00e9pondre aux pr\u00e9occupations en mati\u00e8re de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et de protection des renseignements personnels qu\u2019ont certaines femmes dont il est question dans la demande de divulgation.\n1) Toutes les donn\u00e9es et tous les dossiers que SCC a communiqu\u00e9s au Comit\u00e9 consultatif sur la mise en \u0153uvre (le \u00ab CCMO \u00bb) au sujet des \u00e9tablissements pour femmes, et toutes les demandes de renseignement faites par le CCMO \u00e0 SCC\n[47] SCC dit que les donn\u00e9es qu\u2019elle a fournies au CCMO ne sont ni actuelles ni propres aux \u00e9tablissements pour femmes. En outre, il a fourni au CCMO des donn\u00e9es brutes qui peuvent \u00eatre difficiles \u00e0 comprendre et \u00e0 interpr\u00e9ter sans une bonne connaissance de ses op\u00e9rations et de ses pratiques en mati\u00e8re de collecte de donn\u00e9e et de production de rapports. SCC \u00e9met \u00e9galement des r\u00e9serves quant \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels et \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, et indique qu\u2019il faudrait au moins six mois pour extraire et caviarder les donn\u00e9es transmises au CCMO. Subsidiairement, SCC a offert de fournir des donn\u00e9es \u00e0 jour et propres aux \u00e9tablissements pour femmes. Il propose d\u2019indiquer le nom de l\u2019\u00e9tablissement, un identifiant unique, l\u2019identit\u00e9 autochtone ou non autochtone, ainsi que la raison et la dur\u00e9e du s\u00e9jour dans l\u2019UIS.\n[48] La Commission affirme avoir besoin de donn\u00e9es statistiques pour prouver une constante dans la conduite discriminatoire, s\u2019il y en a une. Elle n\u2019a toutefois pas accept\u00e9 l\u2019offre de SCC et affirme que son experte a besoin de plus de donn\u00e9es. \u00c0 l\u2019annexe A de ses observations en r\u00e9plique, elle a r\u00e9pertori\u00e9 un certain nombre d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments qu\u2019elle sollicite pour chaque femme purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9e dans une UIS, notamment les besoins en sant\u00e9 mentale, les cas d\u2019automutilation ou de tentatives de suicide avant le transf\u00e8rement en UIS, la cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les possibilit\u00e9s de contacts humains significatifs offertes chaque jour, le temps pass\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la cellule chaque jour et les renseignements sur la fa\u00e7on dont se d\u00e9roulent les p\u00e9riodes pass\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de la cellule. La Commission pr\u00e9tend que Dr. Hannah-Moffat a besoin de renseignements personnels pour faire une analyse intersectionnelle des r\u00e9sultats, \u00e0 savoir si les femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral qui ont des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale, qu\u2019elles soient autochtones ou non, sont d\u00e9tenues plus longtemps dans les UIS que les autres.\n[49] Selon SCC, les renseignements que demande la Commission et qui figurent dans son annexe exc\u00e8dent ce dont l\u2019experte dit avoir besoin. Si la Commission a besoin de donn\u00e9es pour d\u00e9montrer le r\u00e9sultat du syst\u00e8me et \u00e9tablir une constante dans la conduite discriminatoire, SCC fait valoir que celle-ci n\u2019a pas besoin de ces renseignements personnels et d\u00e9taill\u00e9s.\n[50] La demande de la Commission, y compris la [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9plique \u00bb qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 titre subsidiaire, est rejet\u00e9e. SCC a d\u00e9j\u00e0 confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019a fourni que des donn\u00e9es brutes au CCMO et que le CCMO ne lui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aucune demande de renseignements se rapportant pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment aux \u00e9tablissements pour femmes. SCC n\u2019est pas tenu de cr\u00e9er des documents qui n\u2019existent pas. En fait, la proposition de SCC est raisonnable et permet \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 l\u2019ACSEF de recevoir des donn\u00e9es agr\u00e9g\u00e9es \u00e0 jour qui sont propres aux \u00e9tablissements pour femmes, notamment le nombre de d\u00e9linquantes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans une UIS par cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le nombre d\u2019autochtones parmi elles, le temps pass\u00e9 dans l\u2019UIS et le nombre de fois qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans une UIS.\n[51] Les observations n\u2019indiquent pas clairement de quels \u00e9l\u00e9ments personnels Dr Hannah-Moffat a besoin si SCC fournit les donn\u00e9es agr\u00e9g\u00e9es, ou \u00e0 quel point les renseignements tr\u00e8s personnels et individualis\u00e9s au sujet de toutes les d\u00e9linquantes transf\u00e9r\u00e9es dans les UIS sont pertinents et n\u00e9cessaires.\n[52] J\u2019examinerai les donn\u00e9es expos\u00e9es dans l\u2019annexe 1 de la contre-r\u00e9plique de SCC et je traiterai de cette question avec les parties \u00e0 la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion pr\u00e9paratoire apr\u00e8s avoir entendu leur proposition conjointe.\n2) Les d\u00e9cisions que les d\u00e9cideurs externes ind\u00e9pendants (les \u00ab DEI \u00bb) ont rendues \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des UIS dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes depuis le 30 novembre 2019\n[53] En vertu de la LSCMLC, les DEI ont le pouvoir de d\u00e9cider si le d\u00e9tenu doit demeurer dans l\u2019UIS. Ils peuvent \u00e9galement modifier les conditions d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. La Commission affirme avoir besoin de ces d\u00e9cisions, car elles sont grandement pertinentes en ce qui concerne le fonctionnement des UIS et les all\u00e9gations de discrimination.\n[54] Dans son affidavit, Mme Lapierre explique que les d\u00e9cisions des DEI sont des d\u00e9cisions individualis\u00e9es et d\u00e9taill\u00e9es qui portent sur les circonstances propres aux d\u00e9linquantes et qui contiennent l\u2019historique social, les probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 actuels et pass\u00e9s, les peines ant\u00e9rieures, les d\u00e9tails sur la communaut\u00e9 d\u2019origine, la cote de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, le plan correctionnel, les d\u00e9linquantes \u00ab incompatibles \u00bb, l\u2019affiliation \u00e0 des groupes mena\u00e7ant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9, les \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ont men\u00e9 au transf\u00e8rement dans l\u2019UIS et les interactions pendant l\u2019incarc\u00e9ration dans l\u2019UIS. Ces d\u00e9cisions comportent \u00e9galement des renseignements personnels \u00e0 propos d\u2019autres personnes, comme des membres de la famille de la d\u00e9linquante, d\u2019autres d\u00e9linquantes et des DEI eux-m\u00eames. Selon SCC, les DEI ont rendu environ 70 d\u00e9cisions depuis 2019.\n[55] SCC produira dix d\u00e9cisions de DEI non caviard\u00e9es \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 l\u2019ACSEF, ainsi qu\u2019au Tribunal, au plus tard le 20 octobre 2023. Les parties travailleront ensemble afin de d\u00e9cider de la mani\u00e8re de choisir les dossiers que SCC fournira. Si elles ne parviennent pas \u00e0 s\u2019entendre et \u00e0 trouver une approche raisonnable en temps utile, l\u2019affaire sera encore retard\u00e9e. Ces dossiers ne doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s \u00e0 aucun t\u00e9moin potentiel ou \u00e0 qui que ce soit d\u2019autre jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que le Tribunal rende une nouvelle ordonnance.\n[56] \u00c0 la suite de mon examen des dossiers, je traiterai de la marche \u00e0 suivre avec les parties apr\u00e8s les avoir entendues, et en particulier apr\u00e8s avoir entendu la Commission au sujet des donn\u00e9es particuli\u00e8res dont son experte a r\u00e9ellement besoin.\n3) Les registres tenus dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes en application des paragraphes 32(3), 34(2), 37(2) et 37.3(4) de la LSCMLC\n[57] La LSCMLC et les directives du commissaire qui en d\u00e9coulent exigent que SCC tienne les registres suivants :\na)Tout contact humain r\u00e9el avec un d\u00e9tenu, qui est g\u00ean\u00e9 ou limit\u00e9 par des obstacles physiques, notamment des barreaux, des vitres de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, des guichets de porte ou des \u00e9crans (par. 32(3));\nb)Toute autorisation de transf\u00e8rement d\u2019un d\u00e9tenu dans une unit\u00e9 d\u2019intervention structur\u00e9e avec les motifs justifiant l\u2019autorisation et les autres solutions possibles \u00e9tudi\u00e9es (par. 34(2));\nc)Toute situation o\u00f9 le d\u00e9tenu s\u2019est vu offrir la possibilit\u00e9 de passer au moins quatre heures en dehors de sa cellule ou d\u2019interagir avec autrui pendant au moins deux heures et a refus\u00e9 de s\u2019en pr\u00e9valoir, en y indiquant la possibilit\u00e9 offerte et toute raison donn\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du refus, et la raison pour laquelle une telle possibilit\u00e9 ne lui a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 offerte (par. 37(2));\nd)Toutes les circonstances entourant toute situation o\u00f9, pour des imp\u00e9ratifs de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, la visite n\u2019a pas eu lieu en personne ou s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e par le guichet de la porte de la cellule (par. 37.3(4));\n[58] La Commission affirme avoir besoin de ces registres pour conna\u00eetre les conditions d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration dans les UIS et pour savoir si les d\u00e9tenues ont la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019avoir des contacts humains r\u00e9els tel qu\u2019exig\u00e9 par la loi.\n[59] SCC dit qu\u2019il y a eu au moins 149 transf\u00e8rements vers des UIS dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes et qu\u2019il faudra un mois de travail \u00e0 temps plein pour extraire tous ces registres, en plus du temps n\u00e9cessaire \u00e0 la r\u00e9vision de ces registres. Il fait \u00e9galement valoir que les registres comportent des renseignements personnels qui devront \u00eatre caviard\u00e9s et qui soul\u00e8vent les m\u00eames pr\u00e9occupations relatives \u00e0 la protection des renseignements personnels et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des d\u00e9cisions des DEI.\n[60] SCC produira un \u00e9chantillon de dix registres non caviard\u00e9s \u00e0 la Commission et \u00e0 l\u2019ACSEF, ainsi qu\u2019au Tribunal, au plus tard le 20 octobre 2023, apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9termin\u00e9 avec la Commission et l\u2019ACSEF quels registres doivent \u00eatre fournis.\n[61] Comme il a \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9nonc\u00e9 ci-dessus \u00e0 propos de la deuxi\u00e8me demande de la Commission, le Tribunal d\u00e9cidera de la prochaine ordonnance, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, lorsqu\u2019il aura examin\u00e9 les registres, que les parties auront pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 leur proposition et que la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique de gestion pr\u00e9paratoire aura eu lieu.\n4) Les documents pertinents sur lesquels SCC compte se fonder dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et \u00e0 l\u2019audience, en se concentrant particuli\u00e8rement sur les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures actuelles\n[62] Initialement, la Commission avait demand\u00e9 de nouvelles versions \u00e0 jour de documents qui ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 produits, ou qu\u2019il \u00e9tait convenu ou ordonn\u00e9 de produire, de fa\u00e7on continue. SCC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait impossible de le faire puisque 67 000 documents ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 produits au cours de cette instance. Il a plut\u00f4t propos\u00e9 de se concentrer sur les politiques et les proc\u00e9dures actuelles sur lesquelles il compte se fonder \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[63] La Commission a accept\u00e9 la proposition de SCC. Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 SCC de communiquer ces documents aux autres parties au plus tard le 20 octobre 2023.\n(a) Aucune ordonnance n\u2019est requise Les photographies des UIS dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes et l\u2019offre de visite de SCC\n[64] Je n\u2019ai aucune ordonnance \u00e0 rendre. Initialement, la Commission avait demand\u00e9 des photographies des UIS dans les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes afin que son experte fournisse une opinion sur les conditions d\u2019incarc\u00e9ration. Il n\u2019existe pas de telle photographie. SCC a offert d\u2019organiser une visite avec l\u2019experte de la Commission pour lui montrer les \u00e9tablissements pour femmes et les UIS, \u00e0 condition d\u2019appliquer des mesures de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 raisonnables. La Commission peut organiser cette visite directement avec SCC.\nVI. M\u00e9diation et expos\u00e9 conjoint des faits [65] Le traitement judiciaire des plaintes de discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans la prestation de services, en l\u2019occurrence celles d\u00e9pos\u00e9es au nom de toutes les femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral au Canada pour divers motifs interreli\u00e9s, est long, co\u00fbteux et n\u00e9cessite beaucoup de ressources tant pour les parties que pour le Tribunal lorsqu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas un plaignant principal. La m\u00e9diation d\u2019une partie ou de l\u2019ensemble des questions en litige ou le choix d\u2019une d\u00e9marche plus collaborative peut mener \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat plus rapide, et ce, dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de toutes les parties int\u00e9ress\u00e9es. Il existe de nombreuses fa\u00e7ons de r\u00e9gler des plaintes, mais parfois, il faut explorer des solutions uniques et cr\u00e9atives.\n[66] Certaines mesures de r\u00e9paration d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public demand\u00e9es par l\u2019ACSEF et la Commission n\u00e9cessiteraient de vastes consultations et r\u00e9formes politiques, et exigeraient des changements op\u00e9rationnels et r\u00e9glementaires dans la prestation des services correctionnels. Bien que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne soit une loi r\u00e9paratrice de large port\u00e9e, le Tribunal reste une cr\u00e9ation de la loi. Il a une comp\u00e9tence limit\u00e9e et ne peut pas rendre n\u2019importe quelle ordonnance. Le Tribunal ne peut pas rem\u00e9dier \u00e0 toutes les injustices. Il ne poss\u00e8de pas non plus l\u2019expertise du l\u00e9gislateur ou du Parlement pour \u00e9laborer des politiques. En outre, le syst\u00e8me accusatoire n\u2019est pas forc\u00e9ment le meilleur moyen de faire valoir de larges all\u00e9gations syst\u00e9miques et de demander des mesures de r\u00e9paration qui n\u00e9cessiteraient d\u2019importantes consultations et r\u00e9formes politiques. Il existe certainement des moyens plus constructifs qui prendraient moins de temps et qui r\u00e9pondraient mieux aux questions d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[67] En vertu de la Loi, le Tribunal instruit les plaintes que la Commission lui renvoie. J\u2019encourage n\u00e9anmoins fortement les parties \u00e0 retourner \u00e0 la m\u00e9diation ou \u00e0 la proc\u00e9dure de m\u00e9diation-arbitrage pour r\u00e9soudre leurs diff\u00e9rends au lieu de recourir aux tribunaux, particuli\u00e8rement vu la nature des plaintes. L\u2019ACSEF et la Commission ont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 des observations au sujet de la vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 des femmes purgeant une peine de ressort f\u00e9d\u00e9ral, en particulier les femmes autochtones et les femmes ayant des probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9 mentale. Travailler en collaboration pourrait permettre le r\u00e8glement d\u2019une partie ou de l\u2019ensemble de ces plaintes de fa\u00e7on bien plus rapide et plus holistique, ce qui serait \u00e9galement dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public.\n[68] M\u00eame si les parties ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 particip\u00e9 \u00e0 des s\u00e9ances de m\u00e9diation, elles peuvent toujours reconsid\u00e9rer cette option lorsqu\u2019elles le souhaitent. Le Tribunal peut nommer un autre m\u00e9diateur ou je peux travailler avec les parties en m\u00e9diation-arbitrage \u00e0 tout moment.\nVII.

D\u00c9CISION SUR REQU\u00caTE\n[1] Les plaignants, Robert Kopeck et Kewal Sidhu, ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des plaintes relatives aux droits de la personne (les \u00ab plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP \u00bb), dans lesquelles ils all\u00e8guent que leur syndicat, la section 500 de l\u2019International Longshore and Warehouse Union (l\u2019\u00ab intim\u00e9 \u00bb), a agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard en raison de leur \u00e2ge.\n[2] Le syndicat, qui nie avoir agi de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire, a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire en rejet des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP au motif que le Conseil canadien des relations industrielles (le \u00ab CCRI \u00bb) a instruit et rejet\u00e9 des plaintes semblables d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par les plaignants (les \u00ab plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI \u00bb). Le syndicat affirme que les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es au motif de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure et de contestation indirecte de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI.\n[3] Pour les motifs qui suivent, la requ\u00eate du syndicat est rejet\u00e9e.\nII. CONTEXTE\n[4] Pendant toute la p\u00e9riode pertinente, les plaignants \u00e9taient membres en bonne et due forme du syndicat et \u00e9taient employ\u00e9s dans le port de Vancouver par divers employeurs en vertu des dispositions d\u2019une convention collective conclue entre le syndicat et les diff\u00e9rents employeurs repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par la BC Maritime Employers Association (la \u00ab BCMEA \u00bb).\n[5] Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la convention collective, les travailleurs dans la cat\u00e9gorie de travail des plaignants (caristes) se voyaient quotidiennement attribuer du travail aupr\u00e8s des employeurs dans le port. Le travail \u00e9tait g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement attribu\u00e9 en fonction de l\u2019anciennet\u00e9 accumul\u00e9e par les membres, les membres en ayant le plus \u00e9tant affect\u00e9s avant les membres en ayant le moins et avant les travailleurs [traduction] \u00ab occasionnels \u00bb non membres du syndicat.\n[6] Vers 2011, le syndicat et la BCMEA ont \u00e9limin\u00e9 les politiques en vigueur sur la retraite obligatoire dans l\u2019industrie \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019abrogation par le gouvernement f\u00e9d\u00e9ral de la retraite obligatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e2ge de 65 ans dans le secteur f\u00e9d\u00e9ral. Les membres \u00e2g\u00e9s de 65 ans qui choisissaient de continuer \u00e0 travailler pouvaient se pr\u00e9valoir du revenu et des prestations du R\u00e9gime de retraite de l\u2019industrie portuaire (le \u00ab revenu de pension \u00bb) qu\u2019ils avaient accumul\u00e9s pendant la dur\u00e9e de leur emploi et de leur adh\u00e9sion au syndicat.\n[7] Le syndicat indique que bon nombre de ses membres se sont oppos\u00e9s au fait que les membres puissent continuer de recevoir leur plein salaire tout en touchant leur revenu de pension. Le syndicat qualifie cette pratique de [traduction] \u00ab double r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration \u00bb.\n[8] En r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 ces objections, le syndicat a institu\u00e9, en 2014, une r\u00e8gle selon laquelle les membres choisissant de toucher leur revenu de pension ne se verraient attribuer du travail qu\u2019apr\u00e8s les autres membres et les travailleurs occasionnels, en d\u00e9pit de toute anciennet\u00e9 accumul\u00e9e (la \u00ab R\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition visant les pensionn\u00e9s \u00bb).\n[9] Cette politique visait les travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s de 65 ans mais de moins de 72 ans qui choisissaient de toucher leur revenu de pension. Toutefois, au fil des ans, ces travailleurs en arrivaient au point o\u00f9 recevoir leur revenu de pension n\u2019\u00e9tait plus une question facultative. Conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions r\u00e9glementaires adopt\u00e9es sous le r\u00e9gime de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, L.R.C. 1985, ch. 1 (5e suppl.) (la \u00ab LIR \u00bb), les travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 71 ans \u00e9taient tenus de toucher leur revenu de pension.\n[10] En 2017, le syndicat a adopt\u00e9 une r\u00e8gle selon laquelle les membres devaient se conformer \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition visant les pensionn\u00e9s \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 ils \u00e9taient oblig\u00e9s, s\u2019ils n\u2019avaient pas d\u00e9j\u00e0 choisi de le faire, de commencer \u00e0 toucher leur revenu de pension conform\u00e9ment aux dispositions de la LIR (la \u00ab R\u00e8gle d\u2019uniformisation visant les pensionn\u00e9s \u00bb).\n[11] En janvier 2018, les plaignants ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI et de la CCDP. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9poque, les deux plaignants \u00e9taient \u00e2g\u00e9s de plus de 71 ans et \u00e9taient tenus de percevoir leur revenu de pension en application de la LIR. Ils ont tous deux tent\u00e9 de continuer \u00e0 travailler. Ils affirment que les autres membres et les travailleurs occasionnels se voyaient attribuer du travail avant eux malgr\u00e9 les dizaines d\u2019ann\u00e9es d\u2019anciennet\u00e9 qu\u2019ils avaient accumul\u00e9es en raison de l\u2019application de la R\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition visant les pensionn\u00e9s et de la R\u00e8gle d\u2019uniformisation visant les pensionn\u00e9s du syndicat. Les plaignants all\u00e8guent que les mesures prises par le syndicat \u00e9taient discriminatoires \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard en raison de leur \u00e2ge et qu\u2019elles leur ont fait subir une perte de revenu et d\u2019autres pr\u00e9judices.\n[12] Le 23 janvier 2019, le CCRI a rejet\u00e9 les plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI (2019 CCRI LD 4089; la \u00ab d\u00e9cision du CCRI \u00bb). Le 12 octobre 2021, la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb ou la \u00ab CCDP \u00bb) a renvoy\u00e9 les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP au Tribunal pour instruction.\nIII. ANALYSE\nA. Le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour entendre la requ\u00eate\n[13] Les plaignants indiquent que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9 leurs plaintes au Tribunal malgr\u00e9 l\u2019argument avanc\u00e9 par le syndicat devant la Commission selon lequel le CCRI a pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment rejet\u00e9 des plaintes semblables concernant des faits similaires.\n[14] Puisque le syndicat n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le judiciaire de la d\u00e9cision de renvoi de la Commission, les plaignants affirment que le syndicat est r\u00e9put\u00e9 avoir accept\u00e9 la d\u00e9cision et que le Tribunal n\u2019a pas comp\u00e9tence pour statuer sur la requ\u00eate en rejet pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par le syndicat. Ils estiment que le Tribunal est oblig\u00e9 par la loi d\u2019instruire leurs plaintes une fois qu\u2019elles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9es par la Commission en vertu des articles 49 et 50 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne [la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb].\n[15] Je n\u2019accepte pas les observations des plaignants \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard.\n[16] Le Tribunal est ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure et a le pouvoir de rejeter une plainte de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9liminaire, lorsque cela est justifi\u00e9. Comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\n[137] Apr\u00e8s avoir examin\u00e9 quelques-unes des dispositions l\u00e9gislatives susmentionn\u00e9es, le juge von Fickenstein a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00ab difficile de voir \u00bb pourquoi il serait dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de quiconque que le Tribunal tienne une audience qui \u00e9quivaudrait \u00e0 un abus de proc\u00e9dure : paragraphe 18. Il a conclu qu\u2019aucune interdiction l\u00e9gale ou jurisprudentielle n\u2019emp\u00eacherait le Tribunal de rejeter une plainte pour abus de proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9liminaire \u00ab \u00e0 supposer dans tous les cas qu\u2019il existe des motifs valables d\u2019agir ainsi \u00bb : paragraphe 19. Sa d\u00e9cision a \u00e9t\u00e9 confirm\u00e9e par la Cour d\u2019appel f\u00e9d\u00e9rale : 2004 CAF 363 (CanLII), 329 N.R. 95.\n[caract\u00e8res gras ajout\u00e9s]\nCanada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral), 2012 CF 445\n[17] C\u2019est lorsque la Commission renvoie une plainte au Tribunal que la comp\u00e9tence d\u2019instruire la plainte prend naissance. Le paragraphe 50(2) de la LCDP donne au Tribunal le pouvoir de trancher toutes les questions de fait et de droit dans les affaires dont il est saisi. Alors, le fait que le syndicat ait pu avoir la possibilit\u00e9 de contester la d\u00e9cision de renvoi de la Commission n\u2019emp\u00eache pas le Tribunal d\u2019exercer son pouvoir de trancher les questions pr\u00e9liminaires dont il est saisi (Melissa Paton c. Spearing Service L.P., 2022 TCDP 37 au par. 13).\n[18] En outre, contrairement \u00e0 ce que soutiennent les plaignants, lorsque la Commission renvoie une plainte au Tribunal pour instruction en vertu du paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas oblig\u00e9 de tenir une audience. L\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab instruction \u00bb au paragraphe 50(1) et du mot \u00ab audience \u00bb au paragraphe 50(3) de la LCDP indique que le renvoi d\u2019une affaire au Tribunal ne conduit pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 une audience. Comme l\u2019indique la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale :\nSi le l\u00e9gislateur avait voulu qu\u2019une \u00ab audience \u00bb ait lieu chaque fois qu\u2019une plainte est renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal, il aurait employ\u00e9 ce mot plut\u00f4t que le mot \u00ab instruction \u00bb, qui est employ\u00e9 dans le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi. L\u2019emploi du mot \u00ab instruction \u00bb dans le paragraphe 50(1), et du mot \u00ab audience \u00bb dans le paragraphe 50(3), montre clairement que le renvoi d\u2019une affaire au Tribunal ne conduit pas n\u00e9cessairement \u00e0 une audience dans tous les cas.\nCanada (Commission canadienne des droits de la personne) c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes, 2004 CF 81 au par. 17 (confirm\u00e9 dans 2004 CAF 363)\n[19] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que le Tribunal a comp\u00e9tence pour examiner la requ\u00eate du syndicat visant \u00e0 faire rejeter les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP malgr\u00e9 le renvoi de ces plaintes au Tribunal par la Commission.\nB. Le moment o\u00f9 les plaintes sont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es n\u2019est pas pertinent\n[20] Le syndicat affirme que les plaignants [traduction] \u00ab sont \u00e0 la recherche du tribunal le plus favorable \u00bb afin d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat plus avantageux. Les plaignants contestent cette affirmation et indiquent que la pr\u00e9misse de la requ\u00eate en rejet du syndicat est erron\u00e9e parce qu\u2019ils ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP avant les plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI. Pour \u00eatre plus pr\u00e9cis, MM. Kopeck et Sidhu ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la Commission les 6 et 8 janvier 2018, respectivement, et leurs plaintes conjointes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI le 15 janvier 2018.\n[21] Les plaignants indiquent que cela montre que les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP \u00e9taient leur [traduction] \u00ab premi\u00e8re priorit\u00e9 \u00bb \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 les enjeux li\u00e9s aux droits de la personne et qu\u2019ils ne tentaient pas de faire entendre leur cause dans le forum le plus favorable. Ils affirment que les plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI n\u2019\u00e9taient que [traduction] \u00ab secondaires \u00bb et n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9es qu\u2019en raison de la [traduction] \u00ab rapidit\u00e9 des d\u00e9cisions rendues par le CCRI [...], les d\u00e9cisions \u00e9tant rendues en quelques semaines plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en quelques ann\u00e9es, comme c\u2019est le cas habituellement dans les affaires devant la CCDP et lors de ses proc\u00e9dures d\u2019instruction \u00bb.\n[22] Les plaignants ont choisi de d\u00e9poser des plaintes soulevant des questions semblables en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne apr\u00e8s de la Commission et du CCRI. En l\u2019absence d\u2019une disposition l\u00e9gislative expresse \u00e0 l\u2019effet contraire, les tribunaux (comme le CCRI) ont une comp\u00e9tence concurrente en mati\u00e8re d\u2019application des mesures l\u00e9gislatives relatives aux droits de la personne (Colombie-Britannique (Workers\u2019 Compensation Board) c. Figliola, 2011 CSC 52 (Figliola) au par. 45).\n[23] Dans ces circonstances, le fait que les plaignants aient d\u00e9pos\u00e9 leurs plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP quelques jours avant leurs plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI, ou leur intention au moment o\u00f9 ils les ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9es, ne constitue pas un facteur pertinent \u00e0 prendre en compte. Ce qui importe est de savoir si les questions soulev\u00e9es dans les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP constituent une contestation indirecte de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI ou si les plaignants sont par ailleurs emp\u00each\u00e9s de proc\u00e9der au motif de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ou au motif d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[24] C\u2019est sur ces questions que je me pencherai \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent.\nC. Les plaintes ne font pas l\u2019objet d\u2019une pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e\n[25] Les r\u00e8gles de la common law que sont la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e, l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure et la contestation indirecte pr\u00e9voient que, chaque fois qu\u2019une question est tranch\u00e9e par un tribunal comp\u00e9tent, cette question ne peut \u00eatre remise en litige, sauf dans le cadre d\u2019un appel ou d\u2019un contr\u00f4le judiciaire. Ces r\u00e8gles reposent sur les \u00ab [...] principes de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances, de pr\u00e9vention de leur multiplication et de protection de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice [...] \u00bb (Figliola au par. 25).\n[26] Bien que ces r\u00e8gles soient reli\u00e9es, ce ne sont pas des concepts identiques. N\u00e9anmoins, au centre de chaque r\u00e8gle sont les principes de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nToutes ces questions visent \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab a \u00e9t\u00e9 statu\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on appropri\u00e9e \u00bb sur le fond de la plainte. Il s\u2019agit, en d\u00e9finitive, de se demander s\u2019il est logique de consacrer des ressources publiques et priv\u00e9es \u00e0 la remise en cause de ce qui est essentiellement le m\u00eame litige. (par. 37)\n[27] Le syndicat soutient que les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es au motif de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e.\n[28] Le crit\u00e8re pour invoquer la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e n\u00e9cessite une analyse en deux temps. Premi\u00e8rement, trois conditions pr\u00e9alables doivent \u00eatre satisfaites : que la m\u00eame question ait \u00e9t\u00e9 tranch\u00e9e, que la d\u00e9cision d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendue soit finale et que les parties, ou leurs ayants droit, soient les m\u00eames. Deuxi\u00e8mement, si ces conditions pr\u00e9alables sont satisfaites, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer, \u00e0 sa discr\u00e9tion, si la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e doit \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 en tenant compte d\u2019un certain nombre de facteurs, notamment l\u2019objet du cadre l\u00e9gislatif adopt\u00e9 pour chaque proc\u00e9dure, l\u2019existence d\u2019un droit d\u2019appel, les garanties proc\u00e9durales offertes aux parties, les circonstances ayant donn\u00e9 naissance \u00e0 l\u2019instance initiale et le risque d\u2019injustice \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des parties en cas d\u2019application de la pr\u00e9clusion (Figliola aux par. 27 et 62).\n[29] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, bien que la d\u00e9cision du CCRI (et les d\u00e9cisions sur requ\u00eate connexes ant\u00e9rieures) soit finale et que les parties devant le CCRI soient les m\u00eames que celles qui sont maintenant devant le Tribunal, je conclus que la port\u00e9e des questions soulev\u00e9es devant le CCRI et le Tribunal est diff\u00e9rente.\n[30] Dans les plaintes aupr\u00e8s du CCRI, les plaignants all\u00e8guent que la R\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition visant les pensionn\u00e9s et la R\u00e8gle d\u2019uniformisation visant les pensionn\u00e9s contreviennent aux articles 37 (le devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste du syndicat) et 69 (le devoir de placement juste du syndicat) du Code canadien du travail, L.R.C. (1985), ch. L-2 [le \u00ab Code \u00bb].\n[31] Dans sa d\u00e9cision, le CCRI a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que, puisque les r\u00e8gles du syndicat constituaient une politique interne qui ne faisait pas partie de la convention collective, l\u2019article 37 du Code ne s\u2019appliquait pas. Par cons\u00e9quent, le CCRI a rejet\u00e9 de fa\u00e7on sommaire cet aspect des plaintes sans mener une analyse en mati\u00e8re de discrimination. Le CCRI a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[...] Les principes applicables au DRJ [devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste] sont bien \u00e9tablis. Le Conseil a toujours soutenu que la port\u00e9e du DRJ en vertu de l\u2019article 37 du Code se rapporte \u00e0 l\u2019exercice d\u2019un droit reconnu \u00e0 un plaignant par la CC [convention collective] applicable et ne comprend pas les affaires internes du syndicat [...]. Le Code ne donne pas au Conseil le pouvoir d\u2019examiner et de surveiller l\u2019administration ou l\u2019application par le syndicat de ses r\u00e8gles internes.\n[...]\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, MM. Kopeck, Sidhu et Elie affirment qu\u2019une nouvelle r\u00e8gle adopt\u00e9e par le syndicat, la R\u00e8gle d\u2019uniformisation visant les pensionn\u00e9s, est arbitraire et discriminatoire parce qu\u2019elle pr\u00e9voit un traitement diff\u00e9rent pour les travailleurs qui touchent une pension de l\u2019industrie en raison de leur \u00e2ge.\nM\u00eame s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une nouvelle r\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition, elle fait tout de m\u00eame partie d\u2019un ensemble de r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition adopt\u00e9es par le syndicat conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 ses proc\u00e9dures internes dans le but de respecter ses obligations en la mati\u00e8re aux termes de la CC [...].\nLe Conseil conclut que le DRJ ne s\u2019applique pas aux circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisque la CC ne reconna\u00eet aux pensionn\u00e9s aucun droit qui leur permettrait de se voir attribuer du travail dans un ordre particulier. Les r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition d\u00e9coulent toujours d\u2019une d\u00e9cision et d\u2019une politique internes du syndicat. En cons\u00e9quence, la plainte de manquement au DRJ est rejet\u00e9e. [caract\u00e8res gras ajout\u00e9s]\nD\u00e9cision du CCRI aux pages 8 et 9.\n[32] En ce qui concerne le devoir de placement juste en vertu de l\u2019article 69 du Code, le CCRI a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que les r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition du syndicat n\u2019\u00e9taient pas discriminatoires sur le fondement restreint que les dispositions pertinentes de la LIR ne contrevenaient pas en elles-m\u00eames \u00e0 la LCDP. Le CCRI a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nEn l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, les plaignants soutiennent qu\u2019en adoptant les r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition en cause, le syndicat a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard pour un motif de distinction illicite. Ils soutiennent que, par l\u2019\u00e9tablissement de r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition, le syndicat r\u00e9alise essentiellement ce qu\u2019il ne peut plus accomplir directement au moyen de politiques sur la retraite obligatoire, car celles-ci contreviennent aux lois sur les droits de la personne. Les plaignants soutiennent que la politique adopt\u00e9e par le syndicat est arbitraire et discriminatoire, car elle prive les travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019emploi et favorise les jeunes travailleurs et les travailleurs non syndiqu\u00e9s (occasionnels).\n[...]\nLa R\u00e8gle d\u2019uniformisation visant les pensionn\u00e9s pr\u00e9voit que les pensionn\u00e9s b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de droits acquis, qui auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 tenus par la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu de toucher leurs prestations du RRIP [revenu de pension] \u00e0 la fin de l\u2019ann\u00e9e de leur 71e anniversaire, seront assujettis \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition visant les pensionn\u00e9s, comme tout autre membre qui choisit ou est oblig\u00e9 par la loi de toucher sa pension. Selon ces r\u00e8gles, les pensionn\u00e9s se verraient attribuer du travail apr\u00e8s les membres r\u00e9guliers et les travailleurs occasionnels, puisque les travailleurs occasionnels cotisent maintenant au r\u00e9gime de retraite de l\u2019industrie.\nLes r\u00e8gles de r\u00e9partition \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tude font une distinction fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019application de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu, qui oblige les membres \u00e0 commencer \u00e0 toucher leurs prestations de retraite \u00e0 un certain \u00e2ge. Comme l\u2019a fait remarquer le syndicat, aucune cour ni aucun tribunal n\u2019a conclu que les dispositions de la Loi de l\u2019imp\u00f4t sur le revenu qui fixent l\u2019\u00e2ge auquel les cotisants doivent commencer \u00e0 toucher leur pension contreviennent \u00e0 la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne. De l\u2019avis du Conseil, une r\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition, comme la R\u00e8gle d\u2019uniformisation visant les pensionn\u00e9s ou la R\u00e8gle de r\u00e9partition visant les pensionn\u00e9s, qui \u00e9tablit une distinction fond\u00e9e sur cette exigence l\u00e9gislative, ne donne lieu ni \u00e0 de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur l\u2019\u00e2ge ni \u00e0 un manquement au devoir de placement juste au titre du Code.\n[caract\u00e8res gras ajout\u00e9s]\nD\u00e9cision du CCRI aux pages 11 et 12.\n[33] Contrairement \u00e0 la question de discrimination pr\u00e9cise examin\u00e9e par le CCRI, la question dont est saisi le Tribunal ne consiste pas \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la LIR est discriminatoire, mais plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la politique du syndicat qui traite les travailleurs \u00e2g\u00e9s de 71 ans diff\u00e9remment des autres travailleurs contrevient \u00e0 la LCDP selon le crit\u00e8re juridique de discrimination.\n[34] Conform\u00e9ment au crit\u00e8re juridique de discrimination, les plaignants doivent d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019ils ont subi un effet pr\u00e9judiciable relativement \u00e0 leur emploi et que leur \u00e2ge a constitu\u00e9 un facteur dans la manifestation de l\u2019effet pr\u00e9judiciable. Si les plaignants d\u00e9montrent ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments, le syndicat a alors le fardeau d\u2019\u00e9tablir une exigence professionnelle de bonne foi pour justifier sa conduite en fonction de facteurs, dont la sant\u00e9, la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et les co\u00fbts : Moore c. Colombie-Britannique 2012 CSC 61; Colombie-Britannique (Public Service Employee Relations Commission) c. BCGSEU, [1999] 3 R.C.S. 3.\n[35] Le CCRI n\u2019a pas examin\u00e9 pleinement ces questions plus larges de discrimination dont est maintenant saisi le Tribunal ni n\u2019a appliqu\u00e9 le crit\u00e8re juridique de discrimination lorsqu\u2019il a rendu sa d\u00e9cision concernant la question \u00e9troite du devoir de placement juste et de repr\u00e9sentation juste du syndicat.\n[36] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que la pleine port\u00e9e des questions dont est saisi le Tribunal n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9termin\u00e9e pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment par le CCRI et que les conditions pr\u00e9alables de la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne sont donc pas respect\u00e9es.\n[37] Par ailleurs, je conclus, dans l\u2019exercice de mon pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et en toute justice, que, m\u00eame si le CCRI examinait la m\u00eame question, la pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 mes doutes quant \u00e0 la qualit\u00e9 des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s et invoqu\u00e9s dans chaque proc\u00e9dure et l\u2019injustice potentielle que causerait une limitation de la port\u00e9e de l\u2019examen des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP par le Tribunal en raison d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du CCRI rendue sur des motifs restreints.\nD. Les plaintes ne constituent pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure\n[38] Le syndicat soutient aussi que l\u2019examen des plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP constituerait un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\n[39] M\u00eame dans un cas o\u00f9 les exigences en mati\u00e8re de pr\u00e9clusion d\u00e9coulant d\u2019une question d\u00e9j\u00e0 tranch\u00e9e ne sont pas satisfaites, le Tribunal peut appliquer la doctrine de l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure pour emp\u00eacher la remise en litige d\u2019une question lorsqu\u2019il serait abusif de le faire : voir Constantinescu c. Service correctionnel Canada, 2019 TCDP 49, aux par. 111 \u00e0 112 et 133 \u00e0 137.\n[40] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 plusieurs principes cl\u00e9s \u00e0 prendre en compte pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a un abus de proc\u00e9dure, notamment ceux \u00ab d\u2019\u00e9conomie, de coh\u00e9rence, de caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et d\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice \u00bb (au par. 33).\n[41] L\u2019application des doctrines relatives au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif comme l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure est un exercice hautement discr\u00e9tionnaire motiv\u00e9 par les imp\u00e9ratifs d\u2019une justice de fond et d\u2019une justice proc\u00e9durale. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Penner c. Niagara (Commission r\u00e9gionale de services policiers), 2013 CSC 19, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00ab [u]ne doctrine \u00e9labor\u00e9e par les tribunaux dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice ne devrait pas \u00eatre appliqu\u00e9e m\u00e9caniquement et donner lieu \u00e0 une injustice \u00bb (au par. 30).\n[42] Tel qu\u2019il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9, le CCRI n\u2019a pas compl\u00e8tement r\u00e9solu la question dont le Tribunal est saisi. Par cons\u00e9quent, le fait d\u2019aller de l\u2019avant avec les plaintes ne risquerait pas de porter atteinte \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9conomie, \u00e0 la coh\u00e9rence, au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des instances et \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019administration de la justice. Les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP ne constituent donc pas un abus de proc\u00e9dure.\nE. Les plaintes ne sont pas une contestation indirecte\n[43] Le syndicat soutient aussi que les plaintes aupr\u00e8s de la CCDP doivent \u00eatre rejet\u00e9es parce qu\u2019elles constituent une contestation indirecte de la d\u00e9cision du CCRI.\n[44] La doctrine de la contestation indirecte emp\u00eache une partie au litige de mettre en doute la validit\u00e9 de l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019un tribunal devant un autre tribunal, en contournant ainsi les voies appropri\u00e9es de l\u2019appel. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Figliola, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a soulign\u00e9 ce qui suit :\nLa r\u00e8gle interdisant la contestation indirecte vise elle aussi la protection de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du syst\u00e8me judiciaire en emp\u00eachant la r\u00e9p\u00e9tition des instances. Elle emp\u00eache les d\u00e9tours institutionnels ayant pour but d\u2019attaquer la validit\u00e9 d\u2019une ordonnance en tentant d\u2019obtenir un r\u00e9sultat diff\u00e9rent devant un forum diff\u00e9rent plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en suivant la proc\u00e9dure d\u2019appel ou de contr\u00f4le judiciaire prescrite : voir Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c.

S.C.F.P., section locale 79, 2003 CSC 63 au par. 33; Garland c. Consumers' Gas Co., 2004 CSC 25 au par. 71). Il s\u2019agit plut\u00f4t d\u2019une doctrine particuli\u00e8re qui emp\u00eache de contester une ordonnance ou son ex\u00e9cution.\n[46] Si une proc\u00e9dure ult\u00e9rieure ne constitue pas une contestation d\u2019une ordonnance d\u00e9finitive ni ne repr\u00e9sente une tentative d\u2019emp\u00eacher l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019une ordonnance, la doctrine de la contestation indirecte ne s\u2019applique pas (Donald J. Lange, The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada, 4e \u00e9d. (Toronto : LexisNexis), 2015 \u00e0 la p. 469).\n[47] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, les plaignants ne cherchent pas \u00e0 contester express\u00e9ment une ordonnance du CCRI concernant le devoir de repr\u00e9sentation juste ou de placement juste du syndicat.

ORDONNANCE 12\nI. APER\u00c7U [1] La succession d\u2019Edward Peters (la \u00ab succession \u00bb) est la partie plaignante en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. M. Peters est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 en 2019, quelques mois apr\u00e8s avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sente plainte aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb).\n[2] La succession et la Commission ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u2019ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Peters (la \u00ab PNP \u00bb), de divulguer certains documents.\n[3] M. Peters \u00e9tait un membre de la PNP et voici les questions qu\u2019il avait soulev\u00e9es dans sa plainte :\na) Au milieu des ann\u00e9es 1990, la maison de M. Peters, situ\u00e9e sur le territoire de la PNP, a br\u00fbl\u00e9. La PNP a refus\u00e9 de lui fournir des fonds ou toute autre aide pour lui permettre de la reconstruire. La PNP a \u00e9galement refus\u00e9 de lui construire une nouvelle maison. Or, selon M. Peters, la PNP a rendu de tels services \u00e0 des membres de la communaut\u00e9 issus d\u2019autres familles.\nb) M. Peters s\u2019est vu refuser la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019assister \u00e0 des assembl\u00e9es de la bande et en a m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 chass\u00e9, par exemple lors d\u2019une r\u00e9union du chef et du conseil de bande, lesquels avaient, selon lui, ordonn\u00e9 qu\u2019il soit harcel\u00e9 chaque fois qu\u2019il se trouvait dans la r\u00e9serve ou \u00e0 des assembl\u00e9es de la bande.\nc) Lui et d\u2019autres membres de sa famille ont fait l\u2019objet de moqueries, de harc\u00e8lement et se sont sentis mal accueillis.\n[4] La succession affirme que la situation de famille, la d\u00e9ficience et l\u2019\u00e2ge de M. Peters expliquent le traitement que celui-ci a subi et que ce traitement est donc discriminatoire en vertu de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb).\n[5] La plainte faisait \u00e9tat de plusieurs autres incidents, mais la succession a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne demandait pas r\u00e9paration pour ces incidents.\nII. D\u00c9CISION [6] J\u2019accueille les demandes en partie, en notant que la PNP a de toute fa\u00e7on accept\u00e9 de fournir certains des documents demand\u00e9s.\nIII. QUESTIONS EN LITIGE [7] Voici les questions qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es pour chacun des documents demand\u00e9s :\nLes documents demand\u00e9s sont-ils en possession de la PNP? Dans l\u2019affirmative, se rapportent-ils \u00e0 une question ou \u00e0 un fait \u00e9voqu\u00e9 dans la plainte ou \u00e0 une ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e? Dans l\u2019affirmative, faut-il encore ordonner leur divulgation au regard des autres principes de divulgation applicables?\nIV. ANALYSE A. Principes applicables en mati\u00e8re de divulgation [8] Aux termes des articles 18 et suivants des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137 (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles de pratique \u00bb), les parties sont tenues de produire tous les documents en leur possession qui se rapportent \u00e0 un fait ou \u00e0 une question soulev\u00e9e dans la plainte, ou \u00e0 une ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e par une partie.\n[9] Aux paragraphes 4 \u00e0 10 de la d\u00e9cision Brickner c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2017 TCDP 28, le Tribunal \u00e9nonce les principes applicables en mati\u00e8re de divulgation.\n[10] L\u2019obligation de divulgation qui incombe aux parties d\u00e9coule du droit que leur conf\u00e8re le paragraphe 50(1) de la Loi d\u2019avoir la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de faire valoir leurs arguments. Pour avoir cette possibilit\u00e9, les parties doivent notamment obtenir la divulgation des renseignements potentiellement pertinents qui se trouvent en la possession ou sous la garde d\u2019une autre partie avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire. La divulgation de renseignements permet \u00e0 chaque partie de conna\u00eetre la preuve qu\u2019elle doit r\u00e9futer et, par cons\u00e9quent, de se pr\u00e9parer ad\u00e9quatement pour l\u2019audition.\n[11] La norme n\u2019est pas une norme particuli\u00e8rement \u00e9lev\u00e9e \u00e0 satisfaire pour la partie requ\u00e9rante. S\u2019il existe un lien logique entre un document et les faits, les questions ou les formes de redressement mentionn\u00e9s par les parties, le document doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9. De plus, la demande de divulgation ne doit pas \u00eatre sp\u00e9culative ou \u00e9quivaloir \u00e0 une partie de p\u00eache. Les documents demand\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre d\u00e9crits de mani\u00e8re suffisamment pr\u00e9cise. Le Tribunal peut exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de rejeter une requ\u00eate en divulgation, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les exigences de justice naturelle et les r\u00e8gles de pratique sont respect\u00e9es, afin d\u2019assurer l\u2019instruction informelle et exp\u00e9ditive de la plainte.\n[12] Le Tribunal peut refuser d\u2019ordonner la divulgation d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve lorsque la valeur probante de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve ne l\u2019emporte pas sur leur effet pr\u00e9judiciable sur l\u2019instance. Le Tribunal doit notamment faire preuve de prudence avant d\u2019ordonner une recherche on\u00e9reuse et fort \u00e9tendue de documentation surtout lorsque le fait d\u2019ordonner la divulgation risquerait d\u2019entra\u00eener un retard important dans l\u2019instruction de la plainte ou lorsque les documents ne se rapportent qu\u2019\u00e0 une question secondaire plut\u00f4t qu\u2019aux principales questions en litige.\n[13] Le fait que des renseignements potentiellement pertinents soient divulgu\u00e9s avant l\u2019audition de l\u2019affaire ne veut pas dire que ces renseignements seront alors admis en preuve ou qu\u2019on leur accordera une importance significative au cours du processus d\u00e9cisionnel.\n[14] De plus, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que l\u2019obligation de divulgation d\u2019une partie se limite aux documents \u00ab qu\u2019elle a en sa possession \u00bb selon les R\u00e8gles de pratique, le Tribunal ne peut ordonner \u00e0 une partie de g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ou de cr\u00e9er de nouveaux documents aux fins de la divulgation.\n[15] Les observations que la PNP a d\u00e9pos\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse aux requ\u00eates comprenaient un affidavit sign\u00e9 par la cheffe de la PNP, Norma Webb, et des copies de plusieurs des documents demand\u00e9s.\n[16] Je commencerai mon analyse ci-dessous par les documents que la PNP n\u2019a pas en sa possession ou ceux qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 divulguer avant de passer aux demandes auxquelles je fais droit et \u00e0 celles que je refuse. Sauf indication contraire, c\u2019est la succession qui a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 toutes les demandes.\n[17] La succession et la Commission contestent certaines des r\u00e9ponses de la PNP concernant les documents disponibles ou ceux qu\u2019elle a en sa possession. La bonne foi des parties est pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e au cours du processus de divulgation. Par ailleurs, leurs affirmations peuvent \u00eatre contest\u00e9es et v\u00e9rifi\u00e9es notamment dans le cadre d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire.\nB. Documents que la PNP d\u00e9clare ne pas avoir en sa possession et ceux qu\u2019elle ne s\u2019oppose pas \u00e0 divulguer (i) Co\u00fbt de construction de la maison de M. Peters en 1977 [18] La PNP d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de trouver le moindre document relatif au co\u00fbt de construction de la maison de M. Peters. Ce document n\u2019est donc pas en sa possession.\n(ii) Versions compl\u00e8tes des documents 1, 2 et 3 de la PNP [19] Les documents demand\u00e9s concernent des r\u00e9novations de logement qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 effectu\u00e9es pour des personnes autres que M. Peters. La PNP a trouv\u00e9 d\u2019autres documents \u00e0 ce sujet, lesquels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 joints \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit.\n(iii) D\u00e9penses en r\u00e9novation engag\u00e9es par la PNP pour la maison de M. Peters [20] La PNP d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de trouver et de fournir seulement deux documents (un document dat\u00e9 du 27 juin 1980 concernant un pr\u00eat contract\u00e9 par M. Peters et un \u00ab formulaire de d\u00e9finition des besoins \u00bb datant de 2016), mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019a trouv\u00e9 aucun document se rapportant aux fonds fournis par le gouvernement du Canada pour la r\u00e9novation de la maison de M. Peters, comme cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9. Les deux documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 joints \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit.\n(iv) Rapport du chef des pompiers [21] La PNP d\u00e9clare qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de trouver le rapport du chef des pompiers, comme il est d\u00e9crit dans la demande. Ce document n\u2019est donc pas en sa possession.\n(v) Notes de Victoria Peters [22] La PNP confirme que toutes les notes de Victoria Peters lui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 transmises avant que cette derni\u00e8re ne soit frapp\u00e9e d\u2019incapacit\u00e9 pour cause de maladie. D\u00e8s qu\u2019elle sera r\u00e9tablie, l\u2019avocat de la PNP lui demandera d\u2019examiner \u00e0 nouveau les documents au dossier.\n(vi) Historique de toutes les constructions et r\u00e9novations de maisons de la PNP [23] La PNP d\u00e9clare avoir fait des recherches diligentes dans les documents relatifs \u00e0 la r\u00e9novation et \u00e0 la reconstruction de maisons dans la r\u00e9serve qu\u2019elle avait en sa possession, au-del\u00e0 de ceux d\u00e9j\u00e0 divulgu\u00e9s, et en avoir trouv\u00e9 quelques-uns de plus. La cheffe Webb a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 Services aux Autochtones Canada (SAC) de lui fournir tous les documents en sa possession relatifs \u00e0 ce sujet. Tous les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires, qu\u2019ils aient \u00e9t\u00e9 trouv\u00e9s dans le cadre de la recherche ou obtenus gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 SAC, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 joints \u00e0 l\u2019affidavit de la cheffe Webb. La PNP s\u2019engage \u00e0 divulguer tout autre document qu\u2019elle pourrait d\u00e9couvrir ou recevoir.\n(vii) Documents demand\u00e9s par la Commission au paragraphe 9 de sa requ\u00eate [24] La Commission a demand\u00e9 cinq documents au paragraphe 9 de sa requ\u00eate en divulgation. S\u2019agissant des points a) \u00e0 d) de la liste de la Commission, la PNP a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 un examen plus approfondi des documents au dossier et qu\u2019elle avait produit tous les documents suppl\u00e9mentaires portant sur la r\u00e9novation ou la reconstruction des maisons des membres de la PNP qu\u2019elle avait trouv\u00e9s. La PNP a aussi demand\u00e9 \u00e0 une personne nomm\u00e9e Angie Lee, \u00e0 SAC, de fournir tout document similaire. Comme le fait remarquer la Commission, la PNP n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 le titre et le r\u00f4le de Mme Lee \u00e0 SAC. Je demande \u00e0 la PNP de fournir ces renseignements dans l\u2019ordonnance que j\u2019ai rendue ci-dessous.\n[25] S\u2019agissant du point e) de la liste de la Commission, la PNP d\u00e9clare n\u2019avoir trouv\u00e9 aucun document suppl\u00e9mentaire.\nC. Demandes de divulgation accept\u00e9es (i) Liste \u00e9lectorale de la PNP [26] Dans ses observations, la succession note que la PNP a indiqu\u00e9 dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait que 77 membres. Elle soutient qu\u2019il suffirait d\u2019examiner la liste \u00e9lectorale pour [traduction] \u00ab identifier les familles votantes \u00bb \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que les membres de la famille de M. Peters \u00ab sont connus pour ne pas voter \u00bb pour le conseil de bande. Elle fait \u00e9galement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 plusieurs d\u00e9cisions de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale se rapportant \u00e0 la fille de M. Peters et \u00e0 la liste \u00e9lectorale. La succession souligne qu\u2019en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 4.2(1)a) du R\u00e8glement sur les \u00e9lections au sein des bandes d\u2019Indiens, C.R.C., ch. 952, les noms des \u00e9lecteurs sont affich\u00e9s et les listes sont publiques. Elle soutient que le fait de divulguer pleinement la liste, combin\u00e9e \u00e0 d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, permettra de constater la division entre les familles votantes privil\u00e9gi\u00e9es et les familles votantes d\u00e9savantag\u00e9es.\n[27] La PNP soutient que le fait de savoir qui a le droit de voter aux \u00e9lections de la bande n\u2019a rien \u00e0 voir avec le remplacement de la maison de M. Peters ou avec sa participation aux assembl\u00e9es des membres. Ces questions n\u2019ont jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 des enjeux \u00e9lectoraux.\n[28] La plainte de la succession repose sur l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle M. Peters, de par sa famille, a \u00e9t\u00e9 trait\u00e9 diff\u00e9remment des autres familles lorsqu\u2019il a demand\u00e9 le financement de la reconstruction de sa maison et lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 aux assembl\u00e9es de la bande. La succession pr\u00e9tend \u00eatre en mesure de pr\u00e9parer des tableaux qui permettraient d\u2019\u00e9tablir des liens entre la fa\u00e7on dont les fonds de la bande ont \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9partis et la fa\u00e7on dont les membres de chaque m\u00eame famille ont vot\u00e9. Bien que la valeur probante de la liste \u00e9lectorale soit limit\u00e9e, la question de savoir comment sont r\u00e9partis les fonds du conseil entre les familles est potentiellement pertinente par rapport aux all\u00e9gations de la succession. En outre, les listes sont publiques selon les r\u00e8glements applicables.\n[29] Cette demande de divulgation est accept\u00e9e.\n(ii) Proc\u00e8s-verbaux des assembl\u00e9es de la bande [30] La succession n\u2019a pas pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la port\u00e9e de cette demande. Elle s\u2019est r\u00e9f\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des passages de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et de celui de la PNP qui faisaient allusion aux proc\u00e8s-verbaux des assembl\u00e9es de la bande. Malheureusement, il semble que les r\u00e9f\u00e9rences particuli\u00e8res \u00e0 ces passages qui figurent dans les notes de bas de page des observations de la succession aient \u00e9t\u00e9 erron\u00e9es ou impr\u00e9cises, et la PNP a fond\u00e9 sa r\u00e9ponse sur ces erreurs, m\u00eame s\u2019il \u00e9tait \u00e9vident de savoir \u00e0 quels passages la succession voulait se r\u00e9f\u00e9rer.\n[31] N\u00e9anmoins, la demande telle qu\u2019elle est formul\u00e9e par la succession est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Ce qui serait potentiellement pertinent pour la plainte, ce sont les renseignements d\u00e9crits dans les observations pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9ponse par la Commission, soit les proc\u00e8s-verbaux des assembl\u00e9es de la bande qui font \u00e9tat des demandes formul\u00e9es par M. Peters en vue d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re apr\u00e8s l\u2019incendie de sa maison.\n[32] La demande de divulgation, telle que reformul\u00e9e par la Commission, est accept\u00e9e.\n(iii) Registres comptables de la PNP [33] La PNP avait divulgu\u00e9 les registres comptables de 2014-2015 \u00e0 la Commission au stade de l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur la plainte. La succession affirme qu\u2019il est \u00e9vident en analysant ces registres que la famille de M. Peters a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable. Elle demande la divulgation d\u2019autres registres afin de [traduction] \u00ab consolider \u00bb ses all\u00e9gations, ce qui signifie, si j\u2019ai bien compris, qu\u2019elle souhaite obtenir des preuves circonstancielles suppl\u00e9mentaires pour \u00e9tayer ses all\u00e9gations.\n[34] La Commission souligne \u00e0 juste titre que la demande de la succession, telle qu\u2019elle est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, est trop g\u00e9n\u00e9rale. La PNP a aussi fait valoir que la port\u00e9e de la demande de la succession n\u2019\u00e9tait pas claire. La Commission demande que les registres de construction et de r\u00e9novation de maisons dat\u00e9s de janvier 1995 (l\u2019ann\u00e9e o\u00f9 la maison de M. Peters a \u00e9t\u00e9 inspect\u00e9e) \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui soient divulgu\u00e9s. La p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e et la port\u00e9e de la demande sont raisonnables.\n[35] La demande de divulgation, telle que red\u00e9finie par la Commission, est accept\u00e9e.\n(iv) Demande de la Commission concernant tous les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (y compris les rapports) dat\u00e9s entre 2015 et 2019 qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 M. Peters [36] La Commission souligne que, selon la PNP, M. Peters a prof\u00e9r\u00e9 de graves menaces \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du conseil de bande avant le 16 f\u00e9vrier 2016, ce qui a amen\u00e9 la PNP \u00e0 faire appel \u00e0 une compagnie pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 lors de la distribution ult\u00e9rieure des ch\u00e8ques. La plainte soul\u00e8ve \u00e9galement des questions de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 puisqu\u2019il y est question de la fois o\u00f9 le personnel responsable de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 a oblig\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9pouse de M. Peters \u00e0 quitter une assembl\u00e9e de la bande en octobre 2016 et o\u00f9 M. Peters a d\u00fb la suivre \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur. La police avait alors \u00e9t\u00e9 appel\u00e9e sur les lieux. La Commission soutient donc que tout document relatif \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 qui fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 M. Peters et qui est dat\u00e9 entre 2015 et 2019, ann\u00e9e du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de ce dernier, est pertinent et doit \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9.\n[37] La PNP n\u2019a pas trait\u00e9 de cette demande dans sa r\u00e9ponse aux requ\u00eates en divulgation.\n[38] Je suis n\u00e9anmoins persuad\u00e9 que ces renseignements sont pertinents par rapport aux questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte et dans la r\u00e9ponse de la PNP. La demande de divulgation est accept\u00e9e.\nD. Demandes de divulgation refus\u00e9es (i) T\u00e9moignage de Swede Peters [39] Le nom de cet individu a \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9 dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la PNP. La succession soutient donc que la PNP devrait \u00eatre tenue de le citer comme t\u00e9moin.\n[40] Or, cette demande n\u2019est pas une question de divulgation. Les parties qui souhaitent que certaines personnes soient appel\u00e9es \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience peuvent demander au Tribunal de d\u00e9livrer une citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre, \u00e9galement connue sous le nom de \u00ab subpoena \u00bb. La proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour demander une citation \u00e0 compara\u00eetre se trouve sur le site Web du Tribunal.\n(ii) Version compl\u00e8te du document 12 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la PNP [41] Ce document a \u00e9t\u00e9 divulgu\u00e9 en m\u00eame temps que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la PNP. Il s\u2019agit de la liste que les membres de la PNP ont sign\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019ils ont r\u00e9cup\u00e9r\u00e9 leurs ch\u00e8ques conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 un accord que la PNP avait conclu avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Kinder Morgan, apparemment au sujet du prolongement de l\u2019ol\u00e9oduc Trans Mountain. Les noms, signatures et cartes d\u2019identit\u00e9 des membres de la PNP \u2014 autres que ceux de M. Peters \u2014 ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9s. La succession soutient que la PNP a d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9ment caviard\u00e9 ces renseignements et qu\u2019en divulguant tous les noms, il sera possible de d\u00e9montrer que M. Peters a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019un traitement d\u00e9favorable.\n[42] En revanche, les listes des personnes qui ont assist\u00e9 aux cinq assembl\u00e9es de la bande pour discuter du r\u00e8glement avant que les ch\u00e8ques ne soient d\u00e9livr\u00e9s n\u2019\u00e9taient pas caviard\u00e9es. La succession affirme que ces listes n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 caviard\u00e9es m\u00eame si elles \u00e9taient consid\u00e9r\u00e9es comme confidentielles. En fait, la succession a commis une erreur d\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Sur la premi\u00e8re de ces listes, il \u00e9tait simplement indiqu\u00e9 que les renseignements expos\u00e9s [traduction] \u00ab ici \u00bb, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire \u00e0 l\u2019assembl\u00e9e, devaient demeurer confidentiels et connus que des membres de la bande, et non que les listes \u00e9taient confidentielles.\n[43] La PNP explique que le document 12 a \u00e9t\u00e9 produit uniquement pour confirmer la date de l\u2019incident au cours duquel M. Peters a \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 de force du bureau du conseil de bande, comme il est all\u00e9gu\u00e9 dans la plainte. La PNP craint que la confidentialit\u00e9 soit compromise si les noms des autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires des ch\u00e8ques sont divulgu\u00e9s sans leur consentement.\n[44] Je trouve l\u2019argument de la PNP convaincant. L\u2019identit\u00e9 des autres membres de la PNP qui sont all\u00e9s r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer leurs ch\u00e8ques n\u2019est pas pertinente au regard des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte. Selon l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la succession, M. Peters a \u00e9t\u00e9 expuls\u00e9 \u00e0 la date indiqu\u00e9e sur ce document, et cette information est donc confirm\u00e9e. Les noms des autres b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiaires ne sont pas pertinents.\n(iii) Documents relatifs \u00e0 Seabird [45] La succession a demand\u00e9 la divulgation de quatre s\u00e9ries de documents sous cette rubrique :\nConvention de r\u00e8glement de la revendication particuli\u00e8re de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Peters relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island R\u00e9solutions du conseil de bande relatives au r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island Liste(s) de bande et liste(s) \u00e9lectorale(s) concernant le r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island, listes et feuilles de pr\u00e9sence pour la s\u00e9ance d\u2019information sur le r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island ainsi que les listes et feuilles de pr\u00e9sence pour le vote de ratification relatif au r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island Lignes directrices sur la tenue d\u2019un vote qui se trouvent \u00e0 l\u2019annexe 3 du r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island\n[46] La succession explique qu\u2019en 2019, la PNP a sign\u00e9 une entente avec le Canada en vue du r\u00e8glement d\u2019une revendication territoriale concernant la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island. M. Peters est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 peu de temps apr\u00e8s la signature. La succession soutient que la convention et les autres documents demand\u00e9s, s\u2019ils sont enti\u00e8rement divulgu\u00e9s, permettront d\u2019\u00e9tablir si M. Peters peut ou non b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier du r\u00e8glement, qui, selon elle, fait partie de la \u00ab r\u00e9paration potentielle \u00bb sollicit\u00e9e.\n[47] Cet argument ne me convainc pas. Il n\u2019est nullement fait mention du r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island dans la plainte. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la succession ne fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence au r\u00e8glement qu\u2019\u00e0 deux endroits. Au paragraphe 185, il est indiqu\u00e9 que M. Peters ou ses h\u00e9ritiers [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019ont rien re\u00e7u \u00bb au titre de la convention de r\u00e8glement et que les \u00ab familles du conseil de bande n\u2019ont pas connu le m\u00eame sort \u00bb. Dans la section portant sur les mesures de r\u00e9paration, l\u2019une des ordonnances sollicit\u00e9es pr\u00e9voit la [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9partition d\u2019une somme forfaitaire de 200 000 $ (plus les int\u00e9r\u00eats) \u00bb au titre du r\u00e8glement territorial. Cette demande de r\u00e9paration n\u2019est li\u00e9e \u00e0 aucune all\u00e9gation formul\u00e9e dans la plainte.\n[48] Dans les observations qu\u2019elle a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es en r\u00e9plique aux requ\u00eates en divulgation, la Commission pr\u00e9tend que le r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island rev\u00eat une certaine importance en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce puisqu\u2019il est mentionn\u00e9 au paragraphe 185 de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 de la succession. Je ne suis pas de cet avis. Le r\u00e8glement n\u2019est mentionn\u00e9 nulle part dans la plainte, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction en novembre 2022, bien plus de trois ans apr\u00e8s la signature dudit r\u00e8glement. Je note que le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la plainte de la Commission a \u00e9t\u00e9 modifi\u00e9 le 21 juillet 2022 afin d\u2019y ajouter la d\u00e9ficience et l\u2019\u00e2ge comme motifs de discrimination et de remplacer le nom de M. Peters par celui de la succession. Aucune autre modification n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 apport\u00e9e.\n[49] Le fait de mentionner le r\u00e8glement dans l\u2019un des 214 paragraphes de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 ne signifie pas qu\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une modification autoris\u00e9e de la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. Personne n\u2019a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 modifier ou \u00e0 \u00e9largir la port\u00e9e de la plainte pour y inclure le r\u00e8glement.\n[50] Le r\u00e8glement de la revendication de la r\u00e9serve de Seabird Island n\u2019est manifestement pas pertinent au regard des questions soulev\u00e9es dans la plainte que la Commission a renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal pour instruction. La demande relative \u00e0 ces documents est donc refus\u00e9e.\n(iv) R\u00e9solutions du conseil de bande prouvant le quorum (au besoin) [51] Par cette demande, la succession cherche \u00e0 s\u2019assurer, par le biais d\u2019une r\u00e9solution du conseil de bande, que l\u2019ensemble du conseil est [traduction] \u00ab bien au fait de l\u2019historique de la proc\u00e9dure susmentionn\u00e9e et du fait qu\u2019elle se poursuit telle qu\u2019elle est actuellement d\u00e9finie \u00bb.\n[52] La succession a retir\u00e9 cette demande dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique et a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle demandait plut\u00f4t des citations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une question de divulgation. La succession peut consulter le site Web du Tribunal pour conna\u00eetre la proc\u00e9dure \u00e0 suivre pour demander des citations \u00e0 compara\u00eetre.\nV. ORDONNANCE [53] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9plique, la succession a demand\u00e9 d\u2019autres ordonnances qui n\u2019avaient rien \u00e0 voir avec ses requ\u00eates en divulgation ni avec celles de la Commission. Or, ces ordonnances ne sont pas en cause et je ne vais pas les examiner dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate. La succession peut pr\u00e9senter des demandes distinctes pour ces ordonnances, et la Commission et la PNP auront la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre avant que le Tribunal ne se prononce.\n[54] J\u2019accueille en partie les demandes de divulgation de la succession et de la Commission. J\u2019ordonne \u00e0 la PNP de divulguer les documents suivants :\nLa liste \u00e9lectorale de la PNP.\nTous les proc\u00e8s-verbaux des assembl\u00e9es de la bande qui se rapportent aux demandes formul\u00e9es par M. Peters en vue d\u2019obtenir de l\u2019aide financi\u00e8re apr\u00e8s l\u2019incendie de sa maison.\nLes registres de construction et de r\u00e9novation de maisons de janvier 1995 \u00e0 aujourd\u2019hui.\nLe titre et le r\u00f4le d\u2019Angie Lee au sein de SAC et les cat\u00e9gories de documents qu\u2019elle devait chercher.\nTous les documents relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate ou \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 (y compris les rapports) dat\u00e9s entre 2015 et 2019 qui font r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 M. Peters\n[55] Les documents et les renseignements doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s dans les 45 jours suivant la communication de la pr\u00e9sente ordonnance \u00e0 la PNP.\nSign\u00e9e par\nAthanasios Hadjis\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 11 septembre 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : HR-DP-2903-22\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Succession d\u2019Edward Peters c.

La plaignante \u00e9tait repr\u00e9sentante de la Native Women\u2019s Association of Nova Scotia. M. Googoo \u00e9tait le pr\u00e9sident ex\u00e9cutif du Forum. Les plaintes visent le Forum, l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e des Premi\u00e8res Nations (APN) et Relations Couronne-Autochtones et Affaires du Nord Canada (RCAANC).\nLa Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) a envoy\u00e9 son dossier de divulgation \u00e0 l\u2019APN et \u00e0 RCAANC. Toutefois, elle a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de la guider relativement \u00e0 la divulgation de documents au Forum. La Commission se demandait si le Forum \u00e9tait une entit\u00e9 juridique. L\u2019APN a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas membre du Forum, qu\u2019elle n\u2019exer\u00e7ait aucun contr\u00f4le sur celui-ci et qu\u2019elle ne devrait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme partie intim\u00e9e. De son c\u00f4t\u00e9, RCAANC a aussi d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il ne devrait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme partie intim\u00e9e. RCAANC a soutenu qu\u2019il n\u2019avait aucun lien employeur-employ\u00e9 avec la plaignante, qu\u2019il n\u2019exer\u00e7ait aucun contr\u00f4le sur le Forum et que M. Googoo ne repr\u00e9sentait pas RCAANC et n\u2019avait pas \u00e9t\u00e9 nomm\u00e9 par RCAANC.\nLe Tribunal doit faire preuve de prudence lorsqu\u2019on lui demande de rejeter une plainte sans tenir d\u2019audience en bonne et due forme. Le Tribunal a conclu que le Forum n\u2019avait pas \u00e9tabli qu\u2019il ne pouvait pas \u00eatre d\u00e9sign\u00e9 comme partie intim\u00e9e. Trop de questions sont demeur\u00e9es sans r\u00e9ponse concernant le Forum, dont la question de savoir s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019une entit\u00e9 juridique contre laquelle une plainte en mati\u00e8re de droits de la personne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\nLe Tribunal a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 la Commission de transmettre son dossier de divulgation au comit\u00e9 ex\u00e9cutif du Forum.

L\u2019intim\u00e9, la Gendarmerie royale du Canada, a fait part de son intention d\u2019appeler comme t\u00e9moins certains officiers sup\u00e9rieurs du district du Nord de la Colombie-Britannique et une personne de son unit\u00e9 de police autochtone \u00e0 Burns Lake.\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que Zoom n\u2019est pas un substitut ad\u00e9quat \u00e0 une audience en personne et que faire t\u00e9moigner ses t\u00e9moins en personne aurait plusieurs avantages. En particulier, tenir une audience en personne montrerait que le Tribunal et les parties sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents dans la communaut\u00e9 pendant le processus d\u2019audience et permettrait aussi aux personnes d\u2019entendre et de voir les preuves dans leur communaut\u00e9 ainsi que de voir et d\u2019entendre les officiers directement.\nLes plaignants et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne se sont oppos\u00e9s \u00e0 cette requ\u00eate et ont demand\u00e9 que l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roule par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Le Tribunal examine les demandes d\u2019audience en personne au cas par cas, tout en tenant compte des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et des int\u00e9r\u00eats des parties, de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de la forme d\u2019audience, et des exigences en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. De plus, le Tribunal prend en consid\u00e9ration le co\u00fbt, le temps et les efforts pour les parties et pour le Tribunal par rapport \u00e0 la nature de la proc\u00e9dure. Dans ce cas-ci, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait pr\u00e9f\u00e9rable de tenir l\u2019audience par Zoom. Il a donc rejet\u00e9 la requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019audience se tiendra sur Zoom.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nCanadian Human Rights Tribunal\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rence : 2023 TCDP\n42\nDate :\n15 septembre 2023\nNum\u00e9ro du dossier :\nT2459\/1620\nEntre :\nCathy Woodgate, Richard Perry, Dorothy Williams, Ann Tom, Maurice Joseph et Emma Williams\nles plaignants\n- et -\nCommission canadienne des droits de la personne\nla Commission\n- et -\nGendarmerie royale du Canada\nl\u2019intim\u00e9e\nD\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate\nMembre :\nColleen Harrington\nTable des mati\u00e8res\nI.

Contexte\n[1] L\u2019audience sur la plainte est en cours. Elle a commenc\u00e9 avec les parties et le Tribunal en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake, en Colombie-Britannique, o\u00f9 la plupart des t\u00e9moins des plaignants ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur une p\u00e9riode de deux semaines, du 1er au 12 mai 2023. L\u2019audience s\u2019est ensuite poursuivie au moyen de la plate-forme de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence Zoom pendant quatre semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires en mai et en juin 2023. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas encore entendu tous les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve que les parties ont l\u2019intention de pr\u00e9senter. Plusieurs t\u00e9moins doivent encore \u00eatre convoqu\u00e9s, notamment en ce qui a trait \u00e0 une r\u00e9paration particuli\u00e8re revendiqu\u00e9e par les plaignants pour laquelle le Tribunal a d\u00fb rendre une d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, dans laquelle il a accept\u00e9 de leur permettre de rouvrir leur dossier (2023 TCDP 21). Par cons\u00e9quent, presque cinq semaines suppl\u00e9mentaires d\u2019audience ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9vues \u00e0 l\u2019automne 2023. Le reste de l\u2019audience devrait avoir lieu par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[2] La GRC a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de tenir une autre portion de l\u2019audience en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake en novembre 2023, afin d\u2019entendre trois de ses t\u00e9moins. Bien que la GRC ait demand\u00e9 ant\u00e9rieurement au Tribunal d\u2019entendre certains de ses t\u00e9moins en personne \u00e0 Vancouver ou \u00e0 Burns Lake, cette demande a fini par \u00eatre abandonn\u00e9e.\n[3] Dans la pr\u00e9sente d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate, il est question de la deuxi\u00e8me demande de la GRC concernant une audience en personne qui se tiendrait \u00e0 Burns Lake en novembre 2023. Les plaignants et la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb) s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la demande et demande \u00e0 ce que l\u2019audience ait lieu par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\nII. Demande d\u2019audience en personne de la GRC\n[4] La demande actuelle de la GRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour la premi\u00e8re fois au Tribunal et aux parties lors d\u2019une conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 12 juin 2023. Selon le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cette conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique, la GRC a fait part de son intention de convoquer \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moins des officiers sup\u00e9rieurs du district du Nord de la Colombie-Britannique et une personne de son unit\u00e9 de police autochtone \u00e0 Burns Lake. L\u2019intention \u00e9tait de convoquer ces t\u00e9moins en r\u00e9ponse aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve des plaignants concernant une des r\u00e9parations qu\u2019ils revendiquent, dont il sera question vers la fin de l\u2019audience. La GRC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voudrait peut-\u00eatre aussi faire t\u00e9moigner un expert en r\u00e9ponse aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires des plaignants.\n[5] Durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 12 juin, la GRC a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle voulait que ces t\u00e9moins comparaissent en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake afin que la communaut\u00e9 puisse entendre leurs t\u00e9moignages. L\u2019avocate des plaignants s\u2019y est oppos\u00e9e, soulignant que le co\u00fbt pour les plaignants de faire revenir leur avocate \u00e0 Burns Lake serait vraisemblablement prohibitif. Le Tribunal s\u2019est demand\u00e9 pourquoi il serait n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre ces t\u00e9moins en personne, puisque les membres de la communaut\u00e9 ne pourraient \u00eatre oblig\u00e9s d\u2019entendre les t\u00e9moignages en personne et que ceux qui souhaitent visionner l\u2019audience pourraient continuer de le faire par vid\u00e9o, comme ils le font depuis la fin mai. Toutefois, j\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que cette demande pourrait \u00eatre examin\u00e9e plus en d\u00e9tail plus tard.\n[6] Le 20 juillet 2023, la GRC a \u00e9crit au Tribunal et aux parties pour demander que trois de ses t\u00e9moins, qui seront convoqu\u00e9s en r\u00e9ponse aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve suppl\u00e9mentaires des plaignants concernant les r\u00e9parations, soient autoris\u00e9s \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake. Ces trois t\u00e9moins ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s comme \u00e9tant le surintendant Dee Stewart de la division E, le surintendant principal Warren Brown, le commandant divisionnaire du district du Nord et un des trois officiers des services de police autochtones \u00e0 Burns Lake, dont le nom n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 indiqu\u00e9 \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0. La GRC a dit comprendre que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve des plaignants concernant les r\u00e9parations commenceraient \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s le 14 novembre 2023, de sorte que ses trois t\u00e9moins compara\u00eetraient vraisemblablement \u00e0 un moment ou \u00e0 un autre au cours de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue du 14 au 24 novembre 2023.\n[7] La GRC affirme que le t\u00e9moignage en personne de ces trois t\u00e9moins aurait plusieurs avantages, notamment les suivants : [traduction] \u00ab Les gens entendraient et verraient une fois de plus les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dans leur communaut\u00e9 et, plus particuli\u00e8rement, entendraient et verraient directement les officiers. Cela montrerait aussi que le Tribunal et les parties sont d\u00e9termin\u00e9s \u00e0 \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents dans la communaut\u00e9 durant l\u2019audience et que les officiers, et la GRC, sont visibles et responsables devant la communaut\u00e9 et le public canadien \u00bb.\n[8] La GRC soutient que Zoom n\u2019est pas un substitut ad\u00e9quat, car [traduction] \u00ab une comparution en personne lie les t\u00e9moignages des officiers \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 et aux pr\u00e9occupations \u00e9ventuelles de la population. Elle permet \u00e0 tous de voir et d\u2019\u00eatre vus. Elle permet de dialoguer apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages \u00bb.\nIII. Positions des parties\n[9] Le Tribunal a entendu les autres parties en ce qui a trait \u00e0 la demande de la GRC de se r\u00e9unir de nouveau en personne en novembre. Les plaignants et la Commission s\u2019opposent \u00e0 la demande de la GRC.\n[10] Les plaignants affirment que les co\u00fbts qu\u2019ils auraient \u00e0 assumer afin que leur avocate soit pr\u00e9sente lors de l\u2019audience en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake seraient consid\u00e9rables et, \u00e0 leur avis, inutiles. Ils demandent au Tribunal de reconna\u00eetre que les plaignants ont des ressources financi\u00e8res extr\u00eamement limit\u00e9es, surtout en comparaison de la GRC. Les plaignants soulignent que la GRC est au courant de leur situation, puisqu\u2019ils en ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait \u00e9tat lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 12 juin 2023 lorsque la GRC a fait cette demande pour la premi\u00e8re fois. Je fais remarquer que, durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 12 juin 2023, j\u2019ai demand\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019avocat de la GRC si sa cliente envisagerait de payer les frais de d\u00e9placement et d\u2019h\u00e9bergement de l\u2019avocate des plaignants. Il a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019il examinerait la question. Aucune autre information n\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 fournie concernant cette demande, dont il n\u2019a pas non plus \u00e9t\u00e9 question dans les observations \u00e9crites de la GRC.\n[11] Les plaignants indiquent aussi que les questions sur lesquelles s\u2019appuie la demande de la GRC visant \u00e0 reprendre l\u2019audience en personne peuvent \u00eatre trait\u00e9es autrement. Ils affirment que si la GRC veut que les officiers soient visibles \u00e0 Burns Lake, ces derniers n\u2019ont pas \u00e0 attendre l\u2019audience du Tribunal pour le faire : [traduction] \u00ab Ils peuvent se rendre visibles et responsables devant la communaut\u00e9 de Burns Lake et le public canadien de nombreuses autres fa\u00e7ons sans faire peser le co\u00fbt d\u2019une audience en personne sur les plaignants autochtones \u00bb.\n[12] De m\u00eame, les plaignants soutiennent que si la GRC cherche un [traduction] \u00ab dialogue naturel \u00bb apr\u00e8s les t\u00e9moignages de ses t\u00e9moins, [traduction] \u00ab qu\u2019elle n\u2019h\u00e9site pas \u00e0 faire en sorte que ses officiers soient pr\u00e9sents dans la communaut\u00e9 alors qu\u2019ils t\u00e9moignent par [Z]oom et \u00e0 inviter la communaut\u00e9 \u00e0 une rencontre par la suite \u00bb.\n[13] Les plaignants soutiennent que la tenue de l\u2019audience sur Zoom permet en fait \u00e0 plus de gens dans plus de communaut\u00e9s d\u2019avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019audience que si elle est tenue en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake. Ils affirment que l\u2019affaire est suivie sur Zoom dans l\u2019ensemble de la Colombie-Britannique et dans plusieurs autres provinces. Une audience en personne tenue \u00e0 Burns Lake exclurait les personnes qui n\u2019y vivent pas.\n[14] Les plaignants soulignent que la raison pour laquelle ils avaient demand\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019audience se tienne en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake pendant les deux premi\u00e8res semaines, au cours desquelles la plupart de leurs t\u00e9moins ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9, \u00e9tait parce que bon nombre des 14 t\u00e9moins qui ont t\u00e9moign\u00e9 n\u2019avaient pas acc\u00e8s \u00e0 Internet et\/ou n\u00e9cessitaient un soutien en personne de la part des conseillers de l\u2019Indian Residential School Survivors Society (l\u2019\u00ab IRSSS \u00bb), qui \u00e9taient pr\u00e9sents durant l\u2019audience. Les plaignants soulignent que les officiers que la GRC a propos\u00e9 de convoquer en novembre 2023 n\u2019ont ni ces difficult\u00e9s ni ces besoins.\n[15] La Commission est d\u2019accord avec les plaignants sur le fait que les dates d\u2019audience en question doivent avoir lieu par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en personne. Elle partage les pr\u00e9occupations des plaignants, surtout en ce qui a trait aux obstacles \u00e0 la participation qui pourraient se dresser si l\u2019audience est tenue en personne, \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du Tribunal de diffuser la proc\u00e9dure en personne sur Zoom. La Commission s\u2019inqui\u00e8te aussi du fait que le temps allou\u00e9 \u00e0 cette portion de l\u2019audience serait r\u00e9duit si l\u2019audience a lieu en personne, puisque les parties pourraient avoir \u00e0 se rendre \u00e0 Burns Lake et \u00e0 en revenir durant la semaine.\nIV. D\u00e9cision\n[16] Pour les motifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessous, je rejette la demande de la GRC de se r\u00e9unir en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake pour entendre les t\u00e9moignages de trois de ses t\u00e9moins en r\u00e9ponse aux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve des plaignants concernant une des r\u00e9parations qu\u2019ils demandent.\nV. Motifs\n[17] Avant mars 2020, le Tribunal tenait la plupart, voire la totalit\u00e9, de ses audiences en personne dans les communaut\u00e9s du Canada. Compte tenu de la crise sanitaire mondiale caus\u00e9e par la COVID-19, le Tribunal, comme de nombreux autres tribunaux et cours au pays, s\u2019est rapidement tourn\u00e9 vers des plates-formes de vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence pour tenir ses audiences. Depuis lors, le Tribunal tient la plupart de ses audiences par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence, puisqu\u2019il estime que cette technologie est \u00e9conomique et facile \u00e0 utiliser et lui permet de mener ses enqu\u00eates sur les plaintes de fa\u00e7on juste et efficace.\n[18] L\u2019assouplissement des restrictions en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 publique a permis au Tribunal de recommencer \u00e0 offrir des audiences en personne sur demande, ainsi que des audiences hybrides, bien que la majorit\u00e9 des audiences continuent de se tenir enti\u00e8rement par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[19] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 [LCDP] exige du Tribunal qu\u2019il \u00ab s\u2019assur[e] que le lieu de l\u2019audition respecte les normes de la LCDP qui exigent un processus d\u2019instruction \u00e9quitable, informel, exp\u00e9ditif et ouvert, o\u00f9 chaque partie a la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de compara\u00eetre, de pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et de faire des observations (voir les paragraphes 48.9(1), 50(1) et 52(1) de la LCDP) \u00bb (Temple c. Horizon International Distributors, 2016 TCDP 20 (CanLII) au par. 11). Le Tribunal a conclu que les audiences par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence respectent ces exigences (Hugie c. T-Lane Transportation and Logistics, 2020 TCDP 25 (CanLII) [Hugie]).\n[20] Le Tribunal a d\u00e9termin\u00e9 que l\u2019utilisation de la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence est une alternative tout \u00e0 fait appropri\u00e9e \u00e0 une audience en personne, qui est juste et \u00e9quitable et qui sauvegarde les principes de justice naturelle et d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale (Hugie au par. 21; Duverger c. 2553-4330 Qu\u00e9bec Inc. (A\u00e9ropro), 2018 TCDP 12 (CanLII) [Duverger] aux par. 27 \u00e0 36).\n[21] Toutefois, cela ne signifie pas que le Tribunal ne prendra pas en consid\u00e9ration les demandes comme celle de la GRC. Dans Duverger, le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[D]ans certaines circonstances, le Tribunal [peut] d\u00e9cider que l\u2019utilisation de la visioconf\u00e9rence n\u2019est pas appropri\u00e9e, par exemple lorsqu\u2019une personne est atteinte de certaines d\u00e9ficiences, lorsque le dossier est d\u2019une grande complexit\u00e9 ou lorsque les technologies disponibles ne permettent pas d\u2019avoir une qualit\u00e9 de visioconf\u00e9rence suffisante. Ces exemples ne sont pas limitatifs et le Tribunal devra \u00e9valuer les circonstances et rendre une d\u00e9cision au cas par cas (au par. 38).\n[22] En effet, les demandes d\u2019audience en personne sont \u00e9valu\u00e9es au cas par cas, le Tribunal tenant compte des pr\u00e9f\u00e9rences et des int\u00e9r\u00eats des parties, de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de l\u2019accessibilit\u00e9 de la forme d\u2019audience et des exigences en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et de s\u00e9curit\u00e9. La proportionnalit\u00e9 est aussi un facteur, ce qui signifie que le Tribunal examinera le co\u00fbt, le temps et les efforts pour les parties et pour le Tribunal par rapport \u00e0 la nature de la proc\u00e9dure.\nA. Il est injuste pour la GRC que ses t\u00e9moins comparaissent par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[23] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9ponse, la GRC affirme ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Puisque le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 la demande des plaignants visant \u00e0 ce que leurs t\u00e9moins ordinaires t\u00e9moignent en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake et a en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 rejet\u00e9 notre demande visant la m\u00eame chose pour le sergent Mackie, il doit faire droit \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente demande afin d\u2019assurer l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et l\u2019\u00e9quilibre de l\u2019audience \u00bb.\n[24] La GRC laisse entendre que l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 exige que le Tribunal doive traiter toutes les parties de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on. Une telle approche ne concorde pas avec l\u2019exigence d\u2019examiner chaque requ\u00eate ou demande sur la base de ses propres faits.\n[25] La demande des plaignants visant \u00e0 ce que leurs t\u00e9moins soient entendus en personne, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en novembre 2022, \u00e9tait fond\u00e9e en partie sur leurs traditions autochtones pour [traduction] \u00ab transmettre les connaissances oralement et en personne \u00bb. La demande indiquait ce qui suit :\n[traduction]\nLes traditions des Autochtones veulent que lorsque nous parlons, nous nous r\u00e9unissions en cercle et nous organisions des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies qui honorent les raisons pour lesquelles il importe tant de dire la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et aussi d\u2019\u00e9couter les autres. Le \u00ab syst\u00e8me judiciaire \u00bb et le Canada n\u2019ont pas \u00e9cout\u00e9. Nous essayons depuis de nombreuses d\u00e9cennies de raconter ces histoires.\nNous ne voulons pas que la personne qui d\u00e9cide si ce que nous disons est vrai ou faux soit \u00e0 l\u2019ext\u00e9rieur de notre cercle. La plupart des gens n\u2019ont pas d\u2019ordinateur \u2013 nous ne pouvons nous joindre \u00e0 la conversion par [Z]oom. Nous raconterons nos histoires et nous nous attendons \u00e0 ce que la personne qui les \u00e9coute soit aussi l\u00e0 en personne.\nCathy Woodgate n\u2019est plus des n\u00f4tres. Elle n\u2019a pas pu raconter son histoire au tribunal des droits de la personne. Elle, Emma Williams et Ann Tom \u2014 qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 certaines des braves personnes \u00e0 d\u00e9poser la plainte contre la GRC \u2014 sont maintenant d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9es. D\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, fr\u00e8res, s\u0153urs et amis ne sont plus en vie. En leur honneur, en l\u2019honneur de dizaines d\u2019autres personnes qui sont mortes avant de pouvoir raconter leurs histoires concernant les \u00e9coles des dioc\u00e8ses et en notre honneur, nous demandons que la membre Harrington respecte notre culture traditionnelle et nous rencontre et nous parle en personne.\n[26] Le Tribunal a fait droit \u00e0 la demande des plaignants de tenir l\u2019audience en personne, avec le consentement de toutes les parties. Des c\u00e9r\u00e9monies ont eu lieu durant cette portion en pr\u00e9sentiel de l\u2019audience, et toutes les parties en ont profit\u00e9.\n[27] Outre l\u2019argument de la GRC selon lequel le Tribunal doit entendre certains de ses t\u00e9moins en personne parce qu\u2019il a entendu de cette fa\u00e7on la plupart des t\u00e9moins des plaignants, son argument concerne principalement son d\u00e9sir de faire entendre, au sein m\u00eame de la communaut\u00e9, ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve aux plaignants et \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 de Burns Lake. La GRC veut montrer qu\u2019elle s\u2019emploie \u00e0 y \u00eatre pr\u00e9sente et qu\u2019elle est visible et responsable devant la communaut\u00e9 et le public canadien.\n[28] Dans ses observations en r\u00e9ponse, la GRC soutient que sa demande va de pair avec la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la demande des plaignants d\u2019\u00eatre entendus en personne. Elle affirme que les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve li\u00e9s \u00e0 la communaut\u00e9 doivent \u00eatre entendus dans la communaut\u00e9, concluant que le surintendant Dee Stewart, le surintendant principal Warren Brown et le sergent Joe Garcia [traduction] \u00ab t\u00e9moigneront au sujet de la sensibilisation et du travail de la GRC au sein de la communaut\u00e9 de Burns Lake et des communaut\u00e9s des Premi\u00e8res Nations \u00bb.\n[29] La GRC n\u2019a pas besoin que trois de ses t\u00e9moins comparaissent \u00e0 Burns Lake pour que la population de Burns Lake ou du Canada assiste \u00e0 leurs t\u00e9moignages. En fait, la portion de l\u2019audience par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence a \u00e9t\u00e9 beaucoup plus accessible au public que ne l\u2019a \u00e9t\u00e9 la portion en personne. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas pu diffuser l\u2019audience en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake, de sorte que les t\u00e9moignages oraux qui y ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits n\u2019ont \u00e9t\u00e9 entendus que par les personnes pr\u00e9sentes. Depuis lors, quiconque ayant voulu visionner l\u2019audience tenue sur Zoom a pu le faire, dans la mesure o\u00f9 cette personne n\u2019est pas assujettie \u00e0 une ordonnance d\u2019exclusion de t\u00e9moins et qu\u2019elle convient de respecter les modalit\u00e9s de l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 qui est en place.\n[30] Des membres de la communaut\u00e9 de Burns Lake et des alentours, ainsi que d\u2019autres personnes au Canada, ont visionn\u00e9 la portion de l\u2019audience tenue par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence, y compris les t\u00e9moignages de tous les t\u00e9moins de la GRC jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant. Les personnes \u00e0 Burns Lake qui n\u2019ont pas d\u2019appareil ou d\u2019Internet pour visionner l\u2019audience \u00e0 la maison ou qui souhaitent le faire avec d\u2019autres et avec les conseillers de l\u2019IRSSS pr\u00e9sents pour offrir du soutien peuvent se rendre dans la salle que le Tribunal a r\u00e9serv\u00e9e \u00e0 cette fin au bureau de la bande Ts\u2019il Kaz Koh.\n[31] En ce qui concerne le [traduction] \u00ab dialogue \u00bb que la GRC souhaite avoir avec la communaut\u00e9, ce n\u2019est pas la raison d\u2019\u00eatre premi\u00e8re d\u2019une audience contradictoire devant le Tribunal. Cependant, la GRC et la communaut\u00e9 sont bien entendu libres d\u2019engager un tel dialogue de leur propre chef. Il n\u2019y a probablement aucune raison pour laquelle les t\u00e9moins de la GRC ne pourraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sents \u00e0 Burns Lake pour t\u00e9moigner par Zoom s\u2019ils le d\u00e9sirent. Je ferais remarquer, toutefois, que m\u00eame si le Tribunal retournait \u00e0 Burns Lake pour l\u2019audience, rien ne garantit que les membres de la communaut\u00e9 viendraient entendre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de la GRC en personne.\n[32] Je suis aussi en d\u00e9saccord avec la position de la GRC selon laquelle Zoom n\u2019est pas un substitut ad\u00e9quat \u00e0 la comparution en personne. Dans Hugie, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 ce qui suit :\n[28] En effet, lors d\u2019une audience virtuelle qui utilise la visioconf\u00e9rence, le t\u00e9moin est en direct devant le membre et le membre est en direct devant lui. Au m\u00eame titre que lorsque le t\u00e9moin apparait en personne devant le membre, ce dernier est en mesure de non seulement constater les signes non-verbaux du t\u00e9moin, mais \u00e9galement de s\u2019assurer et de contr\u00f4ler que les proc\u00e9dures appropri\u00e9es sont suivies en mati\u00e8re de t\u00e9moignage [...].\n[33] D\u2019ailleurs, les parties n\u2019ont eu aucune difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 communiquer leurs objections durant l\u2019interrogatoire de la plupart des t\u00e9moins au cours de la portion de l\u2019audience tenue par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence.\n[34] Enfin, il est difficile de comprendre l\u2019argument de la GRC selon lequel les t\u00e9moignages du surintendant Stewart, du surintendant principal Brown et du sergent Garcia [traduction] \u00ab concerneront [plus] la communaut\u00e9 \u00bb que tout autre \u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par les t\u00e9moins de la GRC, y compris les t\u00e9moignages des enqu\u00eateurs et de leurs superviseurs. Aucun de ces trois t\u00e9moins ne figurait sur la liste de t\u00e9moins de la GRC jusqu\u2019\u00e0 bien apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, en d\u00e9pit de l\u2019exigence de fournir une liste de t\u00e9moins avant l\u2019audience et du fait que la GRC \u00e9tait au courant des r\u00e9parations revendiqu\u00e9es par les plaignants bien avant l\u2019audience. Bien que le Tribunal soit impatient d\u2019entendre leurs t\u00e9moignages, je ne vois aucune raison imp\u00e9rieuse pour le Tribunal et les parties d\u2019\u00eatre pr\u00e9sents physiquement \u00e0 Burns Lake pour le faire.\n[35] Je souligne que la GRC ne soutient pas qu\u2019elle subirait un pr\u00e9judice si ces trois t\u00e9moins doivent t\u00e9moigner par vid\u00e9o plut\u00f4t qu\u2019en personne. Tous ses t\u00e9moins ont jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant t\u00e9moign\u00e9 par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence sans probl\u00e8me. Je ne vois aucun pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 une partie en exigeant que l\u2019audience se poursuive par le biais de la vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence comme nous l\u2019avons si bien fait depuis quatre semaines d\u00e9j\u00e0.\n[36] Un pr\u00e9judice r\u00e9el serait toutefois caus\u00e9 aux plaignants s\u2019ils avaient \u00e0 assumer le co\u00fbt important d\u2019une nouvelle r\u00e9union en personne. Le paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP exige du Tribunal qu\u2019il s\u2019assure que toutes les parties ont la possibilit\u00e9 pleine et enti\u00e8re de pr\u00e9senter, en leur nom ou par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire d\u2019un avocat, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations. Le fait de t\u00e9moigner en personne n\u2019est pas un pr\u00e9requis pour que cette exigence soit remplie. En effet, dans ce cas particulier, l\u2019acceptation de la demande de la GRC pourrait d\u00e9savantager les plaignants \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard. La position des plaignants est que le co\u00fbt pour que leur avocate comparaisse de nouveau en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake serait tr\u00e8s important et que leurs moyens sont modestes. Il est tout \u00e0 fait possible que, si la demande de la GRC est accord\u00e9e, la possibilit\u00e9 des plaignants de pr\u00e9senter, par l\u2019interm\u00e9diaire de leur avocate, des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et leurs observations pourrait \u00eatre compromise.\n[37] Le Tribunal est aussi conscient des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires engendr\u00e9s pour les contribuables canadiens si le Tribunal, la GRC et la Commission devaient retourner \u00e0 Burns Lake pour entendre trois t\u00e9moins.\nB. La demande pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente de la GRC n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9, [traduction] \u00ab en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, rejet\u00e9e \u00bb par le Tribunal.\n[38] Je suis en d\u00e9saccord avec l\u2019affirmation de la GRC selon laquelle le Tribunal a, en r\u00e9alit\u00e9, rejet\u00e9 sa demande visant \u00e0 ce que le sergent Mackie t\u00e9moigne en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake. La GRC a initialement demand\u00e9, durant la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 17 janvier 2023, que ses t\u00e9moins t\u00e9moignent \u00e0 Vancouver, puisque les t\u00e9moins des plaignants t\u00e9moigneraient \u00e0 Burns Lake. Il s\u2019agit de la premi\u00e8re demande d\u2019une audience en personne pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par la GRC. Dans mes directives \u00e9crites du 8 f\u00e9vrier 2023, j\u2019ai rejet\u00e9 cette demande en indiquant que, \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0, c\u2019\u00e9tait encore l\u2019exception, plut\u00f4t que la r\u00e8gle, de tenir des audiences en personne. Cependant, j\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 que s\u2019il y avait une raison autre que la pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence de l\u2019avocat, de son client ou de ses t\u00e9moins de tenir une partie de l\u2019audience en personne \u00e0 Vancouver, comme il y en avait une dans le cas de la demande des plaignants, la GRC pouvait en faire la demande par \u00e9crit.\n[39] Le 23 f\u00e9vrier 2023, la GRC a demand\u00e9 par \u00e9crit que deux ou trois de ses t\u00e9moins, notamment le sergent Mackie et le gendarme Cox, t\u00e9moignent \u00e0 Burns Lake en mai ou juin. Cette demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite pour trois raisons.\n[40] La premi\u00e8re raison, d\u00e9crite comme \u00e9tant la plus importante, \u00e9tait la [traduction] \u00ab r\u00e9conciliation \u00bb. La GRC disait que l\u2019enqu\u00eate qui est l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne avait \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re [traduction] \u00ab rigoureuse et prudente \u00bb et qu\u2019elle voulait que la communaut\u00e9 entende les enqu\u00eateurs t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard en personne et [traduction] \u00ab voie l\u2019esprit dans lequel ils ont proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00bb.\n[41] La deuxi\u00e8me raison \u00e9tait qu\u2019une vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence n\u2019est pas un substitut de l\u2019observation d\u2019un t\u00e9moin en personne. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 que les officiers Cox et Mackie auraient beaucoup d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter, compte tenu qu\u2019ils ont men\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate qui est l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte, la GRC demandait au Tribunal de les entendre en personne, plut\u00f4t que par le biais d\u2019un \u00e9cran.\n[42] La troisi\u00e8me raison \u00e9tait l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9. La GRC indiquait que, pour que justice soit faite, le Tribunal devait entendre ses t\u00e9moins en personne. Son argument \u00e9tait le m\u00eame que dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente demande, \u00e0 savoir que le fait d\u2019entendre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve de la GRC par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence alors que le Tribunal a entendu les t\u00e9moins des plaignants en personne pouvait donner la perception d\u2019une in\u00e9galit\u00e9.\n[43] La demande de la GRC a fait l\u2019objet d\u2019une discussion lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2023. Le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de cette conf\u00e9rence indique que la GRC voudrait vraisemblablement convoquer ses t\u00e9moins en personne \u00e0 un moment ou \u00e0 un autre au cours de l\u2019audience pr\u00e9vue en juin. L\u2019avocate des plaignants a soulign\u00e9 qu\u2019il serait trop cher pour ses clients qu\u2019elle assiste pour une deuxi\u00e8me fois \u00e0 l\u2019audience en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake, puisqu\u2019elle y serait d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sente pendant deux semaines en mai, mais qu\u2019elle leur demanderait s\u2019ils s\u2019opposaient \u00e0 ce que la GRC t\u00e9moigne en personne \u00e0 Burns Lake. J\u2019ai indiqu\u00e9 que la question pourrait faire l\u2019objet d\u2019une discussion ult\u00e9rieure afin de d\u00e9terminer comment et o\u00f9 ces officiers t\u00e9moigneraient.\n[44] Lors de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire suivante tenue le 14 avril 2023, l\u2019avocate des plaignants a indiqu\u00e9 que les plaignants pr\u00e9f\u00e9raient qu\u2019aucun membre du personnel de la GRC n\u2019assiste \u00e0 l\u2019audience, m\u00eame s\u2019ils comprenaient que la GRC \u00e9tait une partie et qu\u2019elle avait le droit de le faire.\n[45] Selon le r\u00e9sum\u00e9 de la conf\u00e9rence t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique pr\u00e9paratoire tenue le 27 f\u00e9vrier 2023, la discussion s\u2019est poursuivie sur la fa\u00e7on dont les officiers t\u00e9moigneraient et sur le lieu de leur t\u00e9moignage. Bien apr\u00e8s le d\u00e9but de l\u2019audience, la GRC a fait savoir que deux des trois enqu\u00eateurs, les gendarmes Cox et Hanley, ne pourraient pas du tout t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 l\u2019audience en raison de probl\u00e8mes de sant\u00e9. La GRC a indiqu\u00e9 que le sergent Mackie t\u00e9moignerait par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence, ce qu\u2019il a fait pendant plusieurs jours en juin 2023. Puisque les plaignants ont mis un peu plus de temps que pr\u00e9vu \u00e0 finir de pr\u00e9senter leur preuve, toutes les parties et les t\u00e9moins de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, y compris le sergent Mackie, se sont montr\u00e9s collaboratifs et flexibles afin de veiller \u00e0 ce que tous les t\u00e9moins puissent \u00eatre entendus. Je souligne qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9 au Tribunal et aux parties de s\u2019adapter \u00e0 l\u2019horaire du sergent Mackie, car il devait se rendre \u00e0 des rendez-vous, et cela a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait.\n[46] Nous avons pu composer assez facilement avec ces probl\u00e8mes d\u2019horaire parce que l\u2019audience se tenait par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence. Je fais aussi remarquer que l\u2019avocat de la GRC a confirm\u00e9, lorsque le Tribunal lui a directement demand\u00e9, que la premi\u00e8re demande de la GRC visant les t\u00e9moignages en personne de ses t\u00e9moins avait \u00e9t\u00e9 abandonn\u00e9e.\nVI. Conclusion\n[47] Je suis d\u2019avis que le fait de finir l\u2019audience par vid\u00e9oconf\u00e9rence acquitte le Tribunal de son obligation de proc\u00e9der de fa\u00e7on \u00e9quitable et exp\u00e9ditive, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 48.9(1) de la LCDP.\n[48] La demande de la GRC est rejet\u00e9e.\nSign\u00e9 par\nColleen Harrington\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\n15 septembre 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal :\nT2459\/1620\nIntitul\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire : Woodgate et al. c.

Bilac all\u00e8gue que les intim\u00e9s l\u2019ont harcel\u00e9 en raison de son identit\u00e9 ou expression de genre et n\u2019ont pas fourni un environnement de travail sans harc\u00e8lement, ce qui viole l\u2019article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (LCDP).\nLe Tribunal a donn\u00e9 raison \u00e0 M. Bilac et a conclu que M. Currie et Mme Abbey l\u2019avaient harcel\u00e9. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, le Tribunal a conclu que M. Currie et Mme Abbey avaient m\u00e9genr\u00e9 M. Bilac \u00e0 plusieurs reprises. Ils ont \u00e9galement \u00ab morinommer \u00bb M. Bilac, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire qu\u2019ils l\u2019ont appel\u00e9 par le nom qui lui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 attribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la naissance. De plus, M. Currie s\u2019est livr\u00e9 \u00e0 un harc\u00e8lement discriminatoire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de M. Bilac en raison de son identit\u00e9 ou expression de genre, et ce, en faisant des commentaires et en posant des questions qui traduisaient sa conviction selon laquelle M. Bilac n\u2019\u00e9tait pas vraiment un homme.\nLe Tribunal a \u00e9galement tranch\u00e9 que les intim\u00e9s ne remplissaient pas les conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es au paragraphe 65(2) de la LCDP qui sont n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9viter d\u2019\u00eatre tenus responsables de harc\u00e8lement discriminatoire. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, le Tribunal a conclu que NC Tractor n\u2019avait pas pris \u00ab toutes les mesures n\u00e9cessaires \u00bb pour emp\u00eacher le harc\u00e8lement, puisque rien n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 fait pour emp\u00eacher le morinommage et le m\u00e9genrage qui s\u2019\u00e9taient produits pendant l\u2019emploi de M. Bilac.\n\u00c0 titre de r\u00e9paration, le Tribunal a examin\u00e9 la jurisprudence et a ordonn\u00e9 le versement de 15 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) de la LCDP et de 3 000 $ \u00e0 titre d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas ordonn\u00e9 le versement d\u2019une indemnit\u00e9 pour perte de salaire parce qu\u2019il a jug\u00e9 qu\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas de lien de causalit\u00e9 entre la discrimination et la perte de salaire que M.

Currie et \u00e0 Mme Abbey de suivre une formation parce que leur situation d\u2019emploi \u00e9tait inconnue et que NC Tractor n\u2019\u00e9tait plus une entreprise op\u00e9rationnelle. Toutefois, si NC Tractor devient op\u00e9rationnelle sous la direction de M. Currie dans l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui suit la d\u00e9cision, il devra alors communiquer avec la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne afin de recevoir une formation pour lui et ses employ\u00e9s sur le harc\u00e8lement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des personnes trans et ayant diverses identit\u00e9s de genre.\nLe Tribunal a \u00e9galement conclu que NC Tractor et M. Currie \u00e9taient solidairement responsables de payer 80 % de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral et 100 % de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 sp\u00e9ciale. En revanche, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que Mme Abbey n\u2019\u00e9tait responsable que de 20 % de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9judice moral. En effet, le Tribunal a estim\u00e9 que le comportement de M. Currie \u00e9tait plus discriminatoire que celui de Mme Abbey.\nContenu de la d\u00e9cision\nIl n'y a pas de document disponible pour cette d\u00e9cision.",

Ordonnance 5\nI. D\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate [1] Les plaignants, SM, SV et JR, qui sont d\u2019origine sud-asiatique, sont des policiers au service de l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la Gendarmerie royale du Canada (la \u00ab GRC \u00bb). Leurs plaintes portent sur le d\u00e9faut de la GRC de les promouvoir lorsqu\u2019ils travaillaient au sein d\u2019une unit\u00e9 de la GRC en Ontario (l\u2019\u00ab unit\u00e9 \u00bb) de m\u00eame que sur le racisme syst\u00e9mique dont l\u2019intim\u00e9e aurait fait preuve dans les processus de promotion en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral au sein de l\u2019unit\u00e9. Les actes en cause, soutiennent-ils, constituent de la discrimination fond\u00e9e sur la couleur, l\u2019origine nationale ou ethnique, la race ou la religion, en contravention des articles 7 et 10 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[2] La GRC nie avoir fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaignants au cours des processus de promotion en question, ou \u00e0 tout autre moment, et elle nie l\u2019existence de toute politique ou pratique syst\u00e9mique visant \u00e0 priver de possibilit\u00e9s d\u2019avancement les plaignants ou tout autre agent de l\u2019unit\u00e9 qui d\u00e9clare appartenir \u00e0 une minorit\u00e9 visible.\n[3] Les questions relatives \u00e0 la responsabilit\u00e9 et aux mesures de r\u00e9paration inh\u00e9rentes aux plaintes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 scind\u00e9es sur consentement des parties, et il est pr\u00e9vu qu\u2019une audience de trois semaines sur la responsabilit\u00e9 d\u00e9bute le 14 novembre 2023.\n[4] En octobre 2021, j\u2019ai accueilli, sur consentement des plaignants, la requ\u00eate de la GRC qui visait \u00e0 obtenir une vaste ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 restreignant la divulgation publique de renseignements. L\u2019ordonnance rendait anonymes les noms des plaignants et de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de m\u00eame que la nature des op\u00e9rations (les \u00ab op\u00e9rations \u00bb) men\u00e9es par l\u2019unit\u00e9, au motif que la divulgation publique de ces renseignements porterait atteinte \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, aux op\u00e9rations de nature d\u00e9licate de la GRC et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des agents : SM, SV et JR c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 35 (la \u00ab d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 \u00bb).\n[5] Sur consentement des plaignants, la GRC d\u00e9pose maintenant une requ\u00eate en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance pour que l\u2019audience se d\u00e9roule \u00e0 huis clos. La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne a choisi de ne pas participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience et ne s\u2019est pas prononc\u00e9e sur la requ\u00eate.\n[6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, j\u2019accueille la requ\u00eate de la GRC et j\u2019ordonne que l\u2019audience devant d\u00e9buter le 14 novembre 2023 se d\u00e9roule \u00e0 huis clos.\nII. Cadre juridique [7] Les instances judiciaires, y compris celles de notre Tribunal, sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9ment publiques et le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est essentiel au bon fonctionnement de la d\u00e9mocratie canadienne.\n[8] Cependant, le droit canadien reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il y a des moments o\u00f9 il faut imposer des limites discr\u00e9tionnaires \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires afin de prot\u00e9ger d\u2019autres int\u00e9r\u00eats publics, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de cette souplesse dans l\u2019application du principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires pour le Tribunal est \u00e9nonc\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, qui conf\u00e8re au Tribunal de vastes pouvoirs lui permettant de rendre les ordonnances qu\u2019il juge n\u00e9cessaires pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction dans certaines circonstances. Le Tribunal peut notamment utiliser ces pouvoirs lorsqu\u2019il y a une s\u00e9rieuse possibilit\u00e9 que la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne soit mise en danger, ou lorsqu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique, d\u2019atteinte au droit \u00e0 une instruction \u00e9quitable ou de contrainte excessive pour une partie ou un t\u00e9moin.\n[9] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession) c. Donovan, 2021 CSC 25 [Sherman (Succession)], la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a r\u00e9affirm\u00e9 que le seuil \u00e0 respecter pour limiter la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est \u00e9lev\u00e9. Pour r\u00e9ussir \u00e0 obtenir une exception au principe de la publicit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sum\u00e9e des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, le demandeur doit \u00e9tablir que :\nla publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important;\nl\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter ce risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence, car d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque; et\ndu point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\n(Sherman (Succession), au par. 38).\n[10] Le crit\u00e8re \u00e9tabli dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession), qui s\u2019applique aux divers types de limites discr\u00e9tionnaires \u00e0 la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires, notamment les ordonnances de mise sous scell\u00e9s, les ordonnances de non-publication, les ordonnances de caviardage et les ordonnances excluant le public d\u2019une audience, clarifie l\u2019analyse que le Tribunal doit r\u00e9aliser en regard de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, et il concorde g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement avec le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 cet article : A.B. et Gracie c. Service correctionnel du Canada, 2022 TCDP 15, aux par. 15 et 16; SM, SV et JR c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 35, aux par. 8 \u00e0 11.\nIII. Analyse [11] Comme je le pr\u00e9cise ci-apr\u00e8s, je juge que la requ\u00eate de la GRC visant \u00e0 obtenir une ordonnance d\u2019audience \u00e0 huis clos satisfait au crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP et clarifi\u00e9 par l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession).\nA. Il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique [12] Tel qu\u2019il est indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, la divulgation de renseignements d\u2019identification et de renseignements relatifs \u00e0 des enqu\u00eates pr\u00e9senterait des risques s\u00e9rieux pour des int\u00e9r\u00eats de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique importants, notamment la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale, pour les op\u00e9rations de nature d\u00e9licate de la GRC et pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des agents, comme le d\u00e9montre l\u2019affidavit incontest\u00e9 qu\u2019a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 l\u2019inspecteur responsable de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de la GRC : SM, SV et JR c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 35, aux par. 12 \u00e0 14.\n[13] Je suis convaincu qu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux que la divulgation, dans le cadre d\u2019une audience publique, de renseignements permettant d\u2019identifier les membres de la GRC qui prennent part aux op\u00e9rations, y compris leur identification \u00e0 titre de plaignants ou de t\u00e9moins dans la pr\u00e9sente instance, puisse mettre en p\u00e9ril la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des agents, les op\u00e9rations de la GRC et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale.\n[14] Je suis \u00e9galement convaincu qu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux que la divulgation, \u00e0 l\u2019audience, de renseignements sur les enqu\u00eates et les techniques qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 employ\u00e9es dans le cadre des op\u00e9rations ou qui le sont toujours, notamment au moyen des t\u00e9moignages et des observations, puisse compromettre les op\u00e9rations de la GRC et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale.\nB. Les mesures raisonnables autres que l\u2019audience \u00e0 huis clos ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter le risque [15] Je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il est n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019exclure le public de l\u2019audience pour att\u00e9nuer les risques \u00e9nonc\u00e9s ci-dessus et qu\u2019il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables qui permettraient d\u2019emp\u00eacher que des renseignements confidentiels soient divulgu\u00e9s au public.\n[16] La GRC soutient que les t\u00e9moignages porteront sur l\u2019exp\u00e9rience de travail substantielle des plaignants et des autres membres qui prennent part aux op\u00e9rations, ce qui est tout \u00e0 fait raisonnable \u00e0 mon avis. Ces t\u00e9moignages devraient essentiellement avoir pour objet les renseignements prot\u00e9g\u00e9s de la divulgation publique conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9, y compris les renseignements sur des enqu\u00eates et des techniques employ\u00e9es dans le cadre des op\u00e9rations et sur la participation des membres aux op\u00e9rations.\n[17] Compte tenu de la vaste port\u00e9e de la d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate relative \u00e0 la confidentialit\u00e9 et de la nature des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et des observations qui devraient \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, je conclus qu\u2019il est raisonnablement impossible d\u2019att\u00e9nuer les risques en tenant une audience efficace devant le public.\nC. La n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 d\u2019une audience \u00e0 huis clos l\u2019emporte sur l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat qu\u2019a la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e0 ce que l\u2019instruction soit publique [18] Enfin, je suis convaincu que les avantages de l\u2019audience \u00e0 huis clos l\u2019emportent sur les effets n\u00e9gatifs qu\u2019elle pourrait avoir \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires.\n[19] L\u2019ordonnance prot\u00e9gera les op\u00e9rations et la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des agents de la GRC en permettant \u00e0 cette derni\u00e8re de continuer \u00e0 recueillir efficacement des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve li\u00e9s \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s criminelles graves au Canada, y compris \u00e0 des menaces \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale.\n[20] Comme l\u2019ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 du Tribunal a \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue \u00e0 l\u2019intention du public et non des parties, elle ne causera pas pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 ces derni\u00e8res. En outre, le public aura acc\u00e8s aux motifs du jugement du Tribunal \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019audience, ce qui lui permettra de comprendre le raisonnement suivi par le Tribunal pour rendre sa d\u00e9cision sur requ\u00eate.\nIV. Ordonnance [21] Pour les motifs qui pr\u00e9c\u00e8dent, la requ\u00eate de la GRC est accueillie. L\u2019audience devant d\u00e9buter le 14 novembre 2023 se tiendra \u00e0 huis clos.\nSign\u00e9e par\nPaul Singh\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 17 octobre 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossiers du tribunal : T2635\/1121, T2636\/1221, T2637\/1321\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : SM, SV et JR c.

La Commission a demand\u00e9 au Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (le \u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u2019instruire la plainte.\n[2] L\u2019intim\u00e9 demande au Tribunal de prononcer une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 pour rendre anonyme l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la plaignante et des t\u00e9moins en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, conform\u00e9ment au paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur le Service canadien du renseignement de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, L.R.C. (1985), ch. C-23 [Loi sur le SCRS].\n[3] Pour les motifs ci-dessous, j\u2019accorde l\u2019ordonnance, mais sous r\u00e9serve de certaines conditions.\nDemande d\u2019une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019intim\u00e9\n[4] Le paragraphe 52(1) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6 [LCDP] pr\u00e9voit que l\u2019instruction des plaintes du Tribunal est publique. Cette disposition fait ressortir le principe selon lequel les processus d\u2019audience doivent se d\u00e9rouler en public. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession) c. Donovan, 2021 CSC 25 (CanLII) (Sherman (Succession)) au paragraphe 1, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a indiqu\u00e9 que le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par le droit constitutionnel \u00e0 la libert\u00e9 d\u2019expression et qu\u2019il repr\u00e9sente \u00e0 ce titre un \u00e9l\u00e9ment fondamental d\u2019une d\u00e9mocratie lib\u00e9rale.\n[5] Toutefois, il se pr\u00e9sente des circonstances exceptionnelles o\u00f9 les int\u00e9r\u00eats oppos\u00e9s justifient de restreindre le principe de la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires (Sherman (Succession) au par. 3). Par cons\u00e9quent, dans le pr\u00e9sent contexte, les membres du Tribunal peuvent, en application de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 52(1)a) de la LCDP, prendre toute mesure ou rendre toute ordonnance pour assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction s\u2019ils sont convaincus qu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique.\n[6] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il y a un tel risque dans l\u2019affaire en question. Il souligne le paragraphe 18(1) de la Loi sur le SCRS, qui pr\u00e9voit essentiellement ce qui suit :\n\u00ab [...] nul ne peut sciemment communiquer des informations qu\u2019il a acquises ou auxquelles il avait acc\u00e8s dans l\u2019exercice des fonctions qui lui sont conf\u00e9r\u00e9es en vertu de la pr\u00e9sente loi ou lors de sa participation \u00e0 l\u2019ex\u00e9cution ou au contr\u00f4le d\u2019application de cette loi et qui permettraient de d\u00e9couvrir l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019un employ\u00e9 qui a particip\u00e9, participe ou pourrait vraisemblablement participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es du Service ou l\u2019identit\u00e9 d\u2019une personne qui \u00e9tait un employ\u00e9 et a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 de telles activit\u00e9s \u00bb.\n[gras ajout\u00e9]\n[7] Le paragraphe 18(2) \u00e9nonce qu\u2019une personne peut communiquer ces informations pour plusieurs motifs, notamment \u00ab [...] si une autre r\u00e8gle de droit l\u2019exige [...] \u00bb (libell\u00e9 de la version fran\u00e7aise de la Loi sur le SCRS) ou \u00ab as required by any other law \u00bb (libell\u00e9 de la version anglaise de la Loi sur le SCRS). Le paragraphe 18(3) pr\u00e9voit ensuite que quiconque contrevient au paragraphe 18(1) est coupable soit d\u2019un acte criminel ou d\u2019une infraction punissable par proc\u00e9dure sommaire.\n[8] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que la communication du nom de la plaignante et de celui d\u2019autres employ\u00e9s actuels ou pass\u00e9s du SCRS mentionn\u00e9s dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la plaignante pourrait contrevenir \u00e0 l\u2019article 18. Durant l\u2019instruction, les parties divulgueront n\u00e9cessairement, au moyen de documents ou de t\u00e9moignages, des informations qui permettront d\u2019identifier des employ\u00e9s actuels ou pass\u00e9s du SCRS. La divulgation de leur identit\u00e9 peut poser un risque s\u00e9rieux pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale.\n[9] La plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 sa plainte relative aux droits de la personne en utilisant son nom complet. Cependant, elle consent \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, sous r\u00e9serve de plusieurs [traduction] \u00ab limites et aspects pratiques \u00e0 prendre en compte \u00bb. Tout d\u2019abord, elle souligne que le paragraphe 18(1) n\u2019englobe pas tous les employ\u00e9s du SCRS, mais seulement ceux qui ont particip\u00e9 ou qui pourraient vraisemblablement participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es.\n[10] En outre, elle soutient que l\u2019ordonnance du Tribunal doit exiger que les initiales r\u00e9elles d\u2019un employ\u00e9 soient utilis\u00e9es et, par souci de coh\u00e9rence, qu\u2019elles le soient tout au long du processus d\u2019audience afin de permettre au Tribunal et aux parties d\u2019identifier chaque employ\u00e9 et de comprendre leur r\u00f4le et leurs responsabilit\u00e9s, ainsi que leur participation aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements et \u00e0 la r\u00e9daction de documents. Le titre complet du poste de chaque employ\u00e9 au sein de la hi\u00e9rarchie du SCRS devrait aussi \u00eatre indiqu\u00e9.\n[11] Enfin, la plaignante demande que, \u00e0 sa demande, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soit tenu de r\u00e9v\u00e9ler le nom complet d\u2019un employ\u00e9 si, par exemple, ses initiales ou son titre ne suffisent pas \u00e0 eux seuls pour l\u2019identifier et d\u00e9terminer sa participation aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements en cause. Les parties s\u2019engageraient \u00e0 ne pas rendre l\u2019information publique ni \u00e0 la soumettre au Tribunal.\n[12] La Commission consent aussi \u00e0 la demande de l\u2019intim\u00e9, sous r\u00e9serve des m\u00eames conditions que celles \u00e9nonc\u00e9es par la plaignante. La Commission souligne, plus particuli\u00e8rement, que l\u2019identit\u00e9 compl\u00e8te d\u2019un employ\u00e9 pourrait avoir \u00e0 lui \u00eatre d\u00e9voil\u00e9e dans certains cas, puisqu\u2019elle n\u2019aura pas les m\u00eames connaissances et la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des op\u00e9rations du SCRS que la plaignante.\n[13] L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019oppose \u00e0 la demande concernant l\u2019utilisation des initiales r\u00e9elles du nom d\u2019une personne. Il soutient qu\u2019une personne peut \u00eatre ad\u00e9quatement identifi\u00e9e en mentionnant le titre du poste qu\u2019elle occupe et les dates. Chaque personne serait syst\u00e9matiquement identifi\u00e9e dans toute la documentation avec les m\u00eames initiales choisies au hasard ou un autre identifiant. En outre, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient qu\u2019il ne peut en aucun cas divulguer le nom complet d\u2019un employ\u00e9.\nAnalyse\n[14] Dans l\u2019affaire SM, SV et JR c. Gendarmerie royale du Canada, 2021 TCDP 35 (CanLII), le Tribunal a indiqu\u00e9 que le crit\u00e8re d\u00e9fini par la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sierra Club du Canada c. Canada (Ministre des Finances), 2002 CSC 41 (CanLII) [Sierra Club] clarifie l\u2019analyse \u00e0 r\u00e9aliser dans le cadre de requ\u00eates en confidentialit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es au titre de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Sherman (Succession), la Cour a indiqu\u00e9 au paragraphe 43 que le crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Sierra Club continue d\u2019\u00eatre un guide appropri\u00e9 en ce qui a trait \u00e0 l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire des tribunaux dans de telles causes. Selon ce crit\u00e8re, tel qu\u2019il est reformul\u00e9 dans Sherman (Succession) au paragraphe 38, la personne qui demande \u00e0 la cour ou au tribunal d\u2019exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 limiter la pr\u00e9somption voulant que les audiences aient lieu en public doit \u00e9tablir que :\nA. la publicit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires pose un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important;\nB. l\u2019ordonnance sollicit\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9carter ce risque s\u00e9rieux pour l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat mis en \u00e9vidence, car d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter ce risque;\nC. du point de vue de la proportionnalit\u00e9, les avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs.\nIl y a un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important\n[15] Je suis convaincu qu\u2019il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important si le nom des personnes vis\u00e9es \u00e0 l\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur le SCRS est divulgu\u00e9. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Jaballah (Re), 2009 CF 279 (CanLII), au paragraphe 20, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que, \u00e0 titre de principe g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, pour assurer la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du Canada, il convient que les agents du SCRS qui participent ou participeront \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles ne soient pas g\u00ean\u00e9s dans la poursuite de leurs activit\u00e9s, ou expos\u00e9s \u00e0 un risque, du fait de la divulgation de leur identit\u00e9 dans le cadre d\u2019une instance. En reformulant cette d\u00e9claration dans le contexte du paragraphe 52(1) de la LCDP, il y a un risque s\u00e9rieux de divulgation de questions touchant la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 publique si l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ces employ\u00e9s est r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9e.\nL\u2019ordonnance est n\u00e9cessaire, car d\u2019autres mesures raisonnables ne permettront pas d\u2019\u00e9carter le risque s\u00e9rieux pour un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important\n[16] Comme je viens de l\u2019indiquer, il y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important dans la protection contre la divulgation publique de l\u2019identit\u00e9 de ces personnes. Pour y parvenir, la mesure la moins attentatoire consiste \u00e0 anonymiser leur identit\u00e9 tout en tenant l\u2019audience en public et en rendant une d\u00e9cision qui n\u2019est pas autrement compromise. L\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction ne sera pas compromise tant que les autres parties sont en mesure de conna\u00eetre l\u2019identit\u00e9 des personnes, et l\u2019anonymisation de leur nom ne nuira pas \u00e0 la capacit\u00e9 de la plaignante \u00e0 donner suite \u00e0 sa plainte.\n[17] Toutefois, la port\u00e9e de l\u2019ordonnance ne doit pas \u00eatre \u00e9largie au del\u00e0 du groupe particulier d\u2019employ\u00e9s qui doivent \u00eatre prot\u00e9g\u00e9s aux termes de l\u2019article 18 de la Loi sur le SCRS, \u00e0 savoir seulement les employ\u00e9s qui ont particip\u00e9 ou pourraient vraisemblablement participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es. L\u2019intim\u00e9 a demand\u00e9 que l\u2019ordonnance d\u2019anonymisation s\u2019applique au nom de la plaignante. Selon le titre du poste de la plaignante au sein de SCRS, qui est d\u00e9crit dans sa plainte et dans les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions des parties, je suis convaincu qu\u2019elle est l\u2019une de ces employ\u00e9s.\n[18] En ce qui concerne la demande de la plaignante et de la Commission visant \u00e0 ce que les initiales r\u00e9elles d\u2019un employ\u00e9 soient utilis\u00e9es, il y a un risque qu\u2019un tiers, apr\u00e8s avoir effectu\u00e9 des recherches, puisse identifier l\u2019employ\u00e9. Cependant, je ne suis pas convaincu qu\u2019en ne donnant que les titres de postes et les dates, la plaignante et la Commission pourront savoir de mani\u00e8re ad\u00e9quate de quelle personne il est question chaque fois. Les principes juridiques de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale dictent que les autres parties doivent au moins pouvoir conna\u00eetre, en toute confidentialit\u00e9, l\u2019identit\u00e9 de la partie anonyme. La plaignante \u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 une employ\u00e9e du SCRS et elle et la Commission sont repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par des avocats qui sont assujettis \u00e0 un engagement implicite selon lequel les informations qu\u2019ils obtiennent durant le processus d\u2019audience demeureront confidentielles et ne seront utilis\u00e9es qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019interne pour les fins de l\u2019audience.\n[19] Par cons\u00e9quent, l\u2019intim\u00e9 devra d\u00e9voiler le nom d\u2019un employ\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante et \u00e0 la Commission si elles ne peuvent identifier la personne \u00e0 partir de son poste ou d\u2019autres informations fournies. Il est entendu que la plaignante et la Commission ne feront de telles demandes que si elles ont \u00e9puis\u00e9 tous leurs efforts pour d\u00e9terminer l\u2019identit\u00e9 de l\u2019employ\u00e9 \u00e0 partir des autres informations.\nLes avantages de l\u2019ordonnance l\u2019emportent sur ses effets n\u00e9gatifs\n[20] L\u2019intim\u00e9 souligne qu\u2019il y a un int\u00e9r\u00eat public important \u00e0 emp\u00eacher la divulgation de l\u2019identit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s en question et \u00e0 s\u2019assurer qu\u2019ils ne sont pas mis en danger lors de l\u2019ex\u00e9cution d\u2019op\u00e9rations de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale du SCRS. Cette n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 importante de prot\u00e9ger les activit\u00e9s de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 nationale l\u2019emporte sur les effets n\u00e9gatifs d\u00e9coulant de l\u2019anonymisation de la proc\u00e9dure. L\u2019instruction restera publique. Il n\u2019y aura aucune incidence sur les d\u00e9cisions rendues dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire autre que l\u2019anonymisation du nom de certaines personnes \u00e0 risque. Les parties sauront toujours de qui il est question, que ce soit gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 leurs connaissances personnelles et \u00e0 d\u2019autres informations ou parce que le nom de la personne en question leur a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 en toute confidentialit\u00e9.\n[21] Par cons\u00e9quent, je conclus que les trois conditions du crit\u00e8re \u00e9nonc\u00e9 dans Sierra Club sont remplies et que, conform\u00e9ment au pouvoir conf\u00e9r\u00e9 au Tribunal en vertu de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP, une ordonnance de confidentialit\u00e9 doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e, sous r\u00e9serve des conditions \u00e9nonc\u00e9es ci-dessous.\nOrdonnance\n[22] J\u2019ordonne ce qui suit :\nToute information qui identifie la plaignante, tout employ\u00e9 actuel ou pass\u00e9 du SCRS qui a particip\u00e9, participe ou pourrait vraisemblablement participer \u00e0 des activit\u00e9s op\u00e9rationnelles cach\u00e9es du SCRS ou toute personne qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 un employ\u00e9 du SCRS et qui a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 de telles activit\u00e9s (un \u00ab employ\u00e9 de confiance du SCRS \u00bb) est d\u00e9sign\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant confidentielle (les \u00ab informations confidentielles \u00bb) en application de l\u2019article 52 de la LCDP;\nLa plaignante ne sera identifi\u00e9e que par le pseudonyme \u00ab AB \u00bb dans tous les documents et actes de proc\u00e9dure d\u00e9pos\u00e9s aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal, dans toute correspondance entre les parties et avec le Tribunal et dans toutes les d\u00e9cisions sur le fond et sur requ\u00eate du Tribunal, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9mission d\u2019une nouvelle ordonnance du Tribunal;\nTout document papier contenant des informations confidentielles d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par les parties doit \u00eatre plac\u00e9 dans une enveloppe scell\u00e9e portant la mention \u00ab Confidentiel \u00bb et ne sera pas vers\u00e9 au dossier public, sauf si une version publique du document, dans laquelle les informations confidentielles sont expurg\u00e9es ou supprim\u00e9es, est aussi vers\u00e9e au dossier public;\nL\u2019intim\u00e9 peut identifier, seulement et syst\u00e9matiquement par les m\u00eames initiales choisies au hasard ou par un autre pseudonyme, un employ\u00e9 de confiance du SCRS dans un document d\u00e9pos\u00e9 aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal et doit indiquer le titre du poste de cet employ\u00e9;\n\u00c0 la demande de la plaignante ou de la Commission, le nom complet d\u2019un employ\u00e9 de confiance du SCRS doit \u00eatre d\u00e9voil\u00e9 lorsque le titre de son poste et les autres informations fournies ne suffisent pas \u00e0 eux seuls pour l\u2019identifier et d\u00e9terminer sa participation \u00e0 un \u00e9v\u00e9nement en cause;\nSi le nom complet d\u2019un employ\u00e9 de confiance du SCRS est d\u00e9voil\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante ou \u00e0 la Commission, elles doivent garder l\u2019information confidentielle et ne peuvent la rendre publique ni l\u2019inclure dans un document pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 au Tribunal;\nToutes les parties sont tenues de respecter la confidentialit\u00e9 des renseignements en ne mentionnant aucune information confidentielle lors de la proc\u00e9dure publique et en ne d\u00e9signant les employ\u00e9s de confiance du SCRS que par les initiales choisies au hasard ou par les autres pseudonymes qui leur sont attribu\u00e9s.\nSign\u00e9 par\nAthanasios Hadjis\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 8 f\u00e9vrier 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du Tribunal : T2715\/9121\nIntitul\u00e9 de l\u2019affaire : AB c.

Les trois plaintes visent des minist\u00e8res gouvernementaux diff\u00e9rents, mais elles portent sur la m\u00eame all\u00e9gation de discrimination. M. Davidson dit ne pas avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 embauch\u00e9 ou promu en raison de sa race. Toutes les parties aux trois plaintes ont demand\u00e9 au Tribunal de \u00ab bifurquer \u00bb leurs audiences, ce qui signifie diviser une audience en deux parties. Lors de la premi\u00e8re partie, le Tribunal d\u00e9terminerait s\u2019il y a eu de la discrimination. Lors de la deuxi\u00e8me, le Tribunal d\u00e9ciderait le montant d\u2019indemnit\u00e9 \u00e0 verser \u00e0 M. Davidson si les minist\u00e8res l\u2019ont en effet discrimin\u00e9.

D\u00e9cision 22\nI. Contexte de la demande\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (\u00ab Tribunal \u00bb) d\u00e9cidant de la requ\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par le plaignant, M. Joshua Dorais (\u00ab M. Dorais \u00bb), demandant la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019instruction du dossier afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels.\n[2] Cette preuve additionnelle constitue 25 courriels entre M. Dorais et diff\u00e9rentes instances ou officiers des Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes (\u00ab intim\u00e9e \u00bb ou \u00ab Forces \u00bb) entre le 4 septembre 2012 et le 5 septembre 2016. M. Dorais argue que ces documents sont pertinents relativement aux r\u00e9parations que pourraient ordonner le Tribunal quant \u00e0 ses pertes de revenus et pertes d\u2019opportunit\u00e9 d\u2019emplois au sein des Forces.\n[3] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (\u00ab Commission \u00bb) consent \u00e0 la demande de M. Dorais et a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 ses repr\u00e9sentations le 13 juillet 2022 tandis que les Forces, qui ont d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les siennes \u00e0 la m\u00eame date, s\u2019y opposent fermement. M. Dorais a eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9plique, ce qu\u2019il a fait le 20 juillet 2022.\n[4] Il est important de noter que dans ce dossier, l\u2019audience est actuellement termin\u00e9e et la preuve de toutes les parties est maintenant close. \u00c0 cet effet, le Tribunal a tenu son audience sur une p\u00e9riode de 18 jours, incluant 2 jours enti\u00e8rement r\u00e9serv\u00e9s pour les arguments finaux des parties. Cette complexe audience s\u2019est d\u00e9roul\u00e9e sur une longue p\u00e9riode, entre le 6 avril 2021 et le 10 mars 2022.\n[5] Ce n\u2019est que le 29 juin 2022, alors que le Tribunal a pris sa d\u00e9cision en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9, que le plaignant a formellement demand\u00e9 la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019instruction afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser des documents additionnels.\nII. D\u00e9cision\n[6] Pour les motifs qui suivent, le Tribunal rejette la demande de M. Dorais.\nIII. Questions en litige\n[7] Afin de d\u00e9terminer si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels de M. Dorais peuvent \u00eatre admis en preuve alors que l\u2019instruction est close, le Tribunal doit r\u00e9pondre aux trois volets suivants :\n1) La preuve, si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, changerait-elle vraisemblablement le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction de la plainte?\n2) La preuve pouvait-elle \u00eatre obtenue avant l\u2019instruction de la plainte en exer\u00e7ant une diligence raisonnable?\n3) Existe-t-il des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal afin d\u2019admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels?\nIV. Fondements juridiques\n[8] Afin de pouvoir r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la question en litige, le Tribunal doit d\u2019abord \u00e9tablir les fondements juridiques relatifs \u00e0 une demande visant la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels.\n[9] Il faut convenir que ni la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (L.R.C. (1985), ch. H-6) (\u00ab LCDP \u00bb), ni les R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137 (\u00ab les R\u00e8gles \u00bb) et ni les anciennes R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (03-05-04) (\u00ab Anciennes R\u00e8gles \u00bb), ne pr\u00e9voit la question de la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate afin d\u2019admettre de la preuve additionnelle, une fois que la preuve fut d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close.\n[10] La jurisprudence devient alors utile et pertinente dans les circonstances, puisqu\u2019elle nous guide sur la d\u00e9marche juridique \u00e0 suivre et les principes de droit qui sont applicables en pareilles circonstances.\n[11] \u00c0 cet effet, le Tribunal a attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention des parties sur deux d\u00e9cisions en la mati\u00e8re en tant que point de d\u00e9part, soit les d\u00e9cisions Micheline Montreuil c. Les Forces canadiennes, 2009 TCDP 15 [\u00ab Montreuil \u00bbl] et 671122 Ontario Ltd. c. Sagaz Industries Canada Inc, [2001] 2 R.C.S. 983 [\u00ab Sagaz \u00bb].\n[12] Dans Montreuil, le Tribunal a appliqu\u00e9 l\u2019analyse de la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada dans Sagaz, qui a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019analyse \u00e0 deux volets effectu\u00e9s dans Scott v. Cook, [1970] 2 OR 769. Au paragraphe 20 de Sagaz, la Cour supr\u00eame a confirm\u00e9 l\u2019analyse suivante \u00e0 deux volets :\n1) L\u2019issue du proc\u00e8s aurait-elle vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en cause avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9?\n2) Aurait-il \u00e9t\u00e9 possible d\u2019obtenir l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve avant le proc\u00e8s en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable?\n[13] Deux distinctions s\u2019imposent entre notre dossier et celui dans Sagas ; d\u2019une part, notre dossier concerne les droits de la personne et rel\u00e8ve du droit administratif et, d\u2019autre part, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas encore rendu sa d\u00e9cision finale, qui est en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 depuis mars 2022. Dans Sagaz, il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t d\u2019une d\u00e9cision concernant une demande en r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate en mati\u00e8re criminelle et dans laquelle le juge avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 rendu sa d\u00e9cision finale.\n[14] Malgr\u00e9 cela, Sagaz demeure une d\u00e9cision cl\u00e9 de la Cour supr\u00eame en mati\u00e8re de r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate. Les enseignements de la Cour sont utiles et pertinents dans les circonstances de notre affaire et comme il sera discut\u00e9 plus tard, cette analyse \u00e0 deux volets a \u00e9t\u00e9 adapt\u00e9e par les diff\u00e9rentes cours afin de correspondre aux cas comme le n\u00f4tre.\n[15] La Commission et les Forces ont attir\u00e9 l\u2019attention du Tribunal \u00e0 la d\u00e9cision Marshall c. Membertou First Nation, 2021 TCDP 36 [\u00ab Marshall \u00bb] de ma coll\u00e8gue membre Raymond. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les Forces fondent principalement son raisonnement sur l\u2019analyse qu\u2019a faite membre Raymond dans ce dossier. Le Tribunal abordera cette question de front.\n[16] Deux points majeurs permettent de distinguer la d\u00e9cision Marshall, tout comme dans Sagaz, avec notre dossier actuel. Cela diminue grandement la pertinence et le poids \u00e0 y accorder.\n[17] Dans un premier temps, membre Raymond s\u2019est questionn\u00e9e quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de la preuve du plaignant, alors que la pr\u00e9sentation de la preuve de la partie intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas encore d\u00e9but\u00e9. Autrement dit, le dossier n\u2019\u00e9tait pas clos et aucune plaidoirie finale n\u2019avait \u00e9t\u00e9 entendue (Marshall, au par. 168). Il s\u2019agissait plut\u00f4t de rouvrir la preuve du plaignant avant que la partie intim\u00e9e entame sa propre d\u00e9fense.\n[18] Dans un deuxi\u00e8me temps, cette demande en r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la partie plaignante s\u2019est faite dans un contexte tr\u00e8s sp\u00e9cifique. La demande a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 une requ\u00eate en non-lieu d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par la partie intim\u00e9e. Le Tribunal comprend de la d\u00e9cision Marshall que le plaignant n\u2019a pas du tout t\u00e9moign\u00e9 dans sa propre plainte et \u00e9tait aussi, selon le Tribunal, sous-repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par sa repr\u00e9sentante. Membre Raymond avait alors permis la r\u00e9ouverture de sa preuve afin de pallier cette situation, avant que l\u2019intim\u00e9e ne pr\u00e9sente sa propre preuve (Marshall, au par. 176).\n[19] La d\u00e9cision dans Marshall se distingue alors grandement de notre situation ; le Tribunal jouissait d\u2019une plus grande marge de man\u0153uvre afin de rouvrir la preuve du plaignant puisque l\u2019instruction n\u2019\u00e9tait pas encore ferm\u00e9e et l\u2019intim\u00e9e n\u2019avait pas encore d\u00e9but\u00e9 la pr\u00e9sentation de sa propre preuve.\n[20] Le Tribunal est d\u2019avis que la pr\u00e9sente situation se rapproche davantage \u00e0 celle dans Montreuil, dans laquelle le membre instructeur avait, lui aussi, pris sa d\u00e9cision en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et n\u2019avait pas encore rendu sa d\u00e9cision finale.\n[21] Avec \u00e9gard pour l\u2019analyse faite par le membre instructeur dans Marshall, je suis d\u2019avis qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 du test \u00e0 appliquer dans les circonstances dans lesquelles nous nous retrouvons dans le dossier de M. Dorais. Le test dans Montreuil est, dans notre cas, la bonne analyse, tel qu\u2019endoss\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du Canada [\u00ab Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale \u00bb]\n[22] En 2011, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est pench\u00e9e une nouvelle fois sur cette question visant la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate apr\u00e8s la pr\u00e9sentation des plaidoiries, mais avant que le jugement final soit rendu ou que les motifs soient prononc\u00e9s (voir Varco Canada Limited c. Pason Systems Corp., 2011 CF 467 (CanLII) [\u00ab Varco \u00bb]).\n[23] Dans Varco, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9t\u00e9 non-\u00e9quivoque en \u00e9non\u00e7ant que la jurisprudence relative \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate apr\u00e8s que les motifs ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rendus (par exemple dans Sagaz) continue d\u2019\u00eatre utile et permet de nous orienter.\n[24] L\u2019honorable juge Phelan a \u00e9crit au paragraphe 15 de Varco que :\nLe premier point, le principe primordial, c\u2019est que la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019un proc\u00e8s rel\u00e8ve d\u2019un large pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire, pouvoir qui doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec parcimonie et prudence. La finalit\u00e9 d\u2019un proc\u00e8s est un concept essentiel dans notre syst\u00e8me de justice; personne ne peut appr\u00e9cier ce concept davantage que le juge qui pr\u00e9side, qui est confront\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00e2che d\u00e9plaisante de rouvrir une affaire pour laquelle il a commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 r\u00e9diger ses motifs.\n[25] Au paragraphe 17, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a continu\u00e9 son analyse en faisant \u00e9tat de cette diff\u00e9rence importante avec la d\u00e9cision Sagaz, puisque dans Vasco, la Cour n\u2019avait pas encore rendu son jugement final. Il s\u2019agit de la m\u00eame distinction qu\u2019a faite le Tribunal dans les paragraphes pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents de cette d\u00e9cision.\n[26] Ce faisant, l\u2019honorable juge Phelan a reformul\u00e9 la premi\u00e8re question de l\u2019analyse \u00e0 deux volets dans Sagaz, qui \u00e9tait \u00ab l\u2019issue du proc\u00e8s aurait-elle vraisemblablement \u00e9t\u00e9 diff\u00e9rente si l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ment de preuve en cause avait \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9? \u00bb. Il pose plut\u00f4t la question suivante : \u00ab les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve, s\u2019ils avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, auraient-ils pu influer sur l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire? \u00bb. Selon la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, cette question commande alors une analyse quant \u00e0 la pertinence et l\u2019importance des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels vis\u00e9s par la demande (Varco, au par. 17).\n[27] En plus de cette analyse modifi\u00e9e \u00e0 deux volets, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 une autre consid\u00e9ration, soit celle de l\u2019existence de circonstances exceptionnelles. \u00c0 ce sujet, elle affirme que le d\u00e9cideur peut exercer son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il existe des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant l\u2019annulation du crit\u00e8re de la diligence raisonnable, qui est pr\u00e9vu au deuxi\u00e8me volet de l\u2019analyse, ou du moins, d\u2019en diminuer son importance, dans son ensemble (Varco, au par. 20). Elle ajoute que le fait qu\u2019un d\u00e9cideur puisse \u00eatre induit en erreur peut \u00eatre un aspect \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer dans ce volet de l\u2019existence de circonstances exceptionnelles.\n[28] Toujours dans Varco, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale pr\u00e9cise au paragraphe 21 que plusieurs facteurs tels que la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la fiabilit\u00e9, la diligence raisonnable et le pr\u00e9judice font partie de l\u2019analyse globale faite par le d\u00e9cideur dans le contexte de demande de r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate afin d\u2019y admettre de la preuve additionnelle (la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale s\u2019est fond\u00e9e sur Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. v Apotex Inc., 2009 FC 294).\n[29] L\u2019honorable juge Phelan a \u00e9crit au paragraphe 22 de Vasco, que :\n[\u2026] lorsqu\u2019on regroupe tous les facteurs, crit\u00e8res et points \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer, l\u2019importance de l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 du proc\u00e8s \u2013 la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 au moyen de la preuve \u2013 est le point primordial \u00e0 consid\u00e9rer. Dans une certaine mesure, cette consid\u00e9ration est prise en compte quand on se demande si le tribunal pourrait \u00eatre induit en erreur.\n[30] R\u00e9cemment, l\u2019honorable juge Lafreni\u00e8re a aussi trait\u00e9 d\u2019une demande en r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate visant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s que la preuve des parties fut close, mais avant la pr\u00e9sentation des plaidoiries (Rovi Guides, Inc. c. Vid\u00e9otron Lt\u00e9e, 2021 CF 19 (CanLII) [\u00ab Rovi Guides \u00bb], au par. 16). Encore une fois, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a adopt\u00e9 l\u2019analyse \u00e0 deux volets de la Cour supr\u00eame dans Sagaz, qui reprenait le test dans Scott, en indiquant qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait tout aussi applicable dans les circonstances dont elle \u00e9tait saisie.\n[31] Dans Rovi Guides, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a ajout\u00e9 que l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat du public quant au caract\u00e8re d\u00e9finitif des litiges demeurait une consid\u00e9ration importante lors de l\u2019analyse de ce type de demande, en raison de l\u2019injustice potentielle que la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate pourrait cr\u00e9er (au paragraphe 18).\n[32] Toutefois, le juge Lafreni\u00e8re a ajout\u00e9 que le d\u00e9faut d\u2019exercer une diligence raisonnable par une partie afin d\u2019obtenir la preuve avant le proc\u00e8s n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement fatal ; le d\u00e9cideur conserve son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire et r\u00e9siduel permettant d\u2019admettre de la nouvelle preuve lorsque les int\u00e9r\u00eats de la justice le justifient, et ce, m\u00eame si l\u2019analyse \u00e0 doubles volets n\u2019est pas rencontr\u00e9e (Rovi Guides, au par. 27. Voir \u00e9galement Brace c. Canada, 2014 CAF 92 (CanLII), au par. 12 [\u00ab Brace \u00bb]).\n[33] Dans Brace, l\u2019honorable juge Stratas rappelait que ce pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire r\u00e9siduel ne devait \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 qu\u2019avec beaucoup de soin et que dans les cas les plus clairs. Plus pr\u00e8s de nous, dans Montreuil, notre Tribunal reprenait aussi cette m\u00eame id\u00e9e ; lorsqu\u2019un tribunal ou une cour utilise son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin de rouvrir l\u2019enqu\u00eate, il doit n\u00e9cessairement le faire avec la plus grande prudence et avec mod\u00e9ration, afin d\u2019\u00e9viter la supercherie et le recours abusif aux tribunaux (Montreuil, au par. 16).\n[34] En se fondant sur les enseignements de la Cour supr\u00eame et de la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale, l\u2019analyse sur la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une instruction afin de permettre le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels avant que la d\u00e9cision finale du Tribunal ne soit rendue s\u2019\u00e9nonce alors de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n1) La preuve, si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, changerait-elle vraisemblablement le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction de la plainte?\n2) La preuve pouvait-elle \u00eatre obtenue avant l\u2019instruction de la plainte en exer\u00e7ant une diligence raisonnable?\n3) Existe-t-il des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin d\u2019admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels?\n[35] Au final, tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments soul\u00e8vent fondamentalement une question de pr\u00e9judice. Lorsque le Tribunal doit soupeser les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9els que pourrait procurer la preuve additionnelle, il doit n\u00e9cessairement analyser les inconv\u00e9nients que cela pourrait aussi cr\u00e9er, en plus de consid\u00e9rer l\u2019un des principes fondamentaux sur lequel s\u2019appuie notre syst\u00e8me judiciaire, soit la finalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats judiciaires. Il ne s\u2019agit pas simplement de rouvrir l\u2019enqu\u00eate et d\u2019accorder la possibilit\u00e9 toute simple d\u2019ajouter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s que le d\u00e9bat judiciaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9 clos. Il ne s\u2019agit pas non plus de bonifier ou de parfaire la preuve ayant d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[36] Il faut ainsi \u00e9valuer les impacts que la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate comporte par exemple le fait de devoir rappeler des t\u00e9moins, retenir des dates additionnelles pour entendre les parties, la preuve, les plaidoiries. Il faut aussi consid\u00e9rer le temps, les co\u00fbts, les ressources qui seront n\u00e9cessaires tant pour les parties que le Tribunal afin de compl\u00e9ter ces \u00e9tapes.\n[37] Enfin, les principes de justice naturelle comprennent le droit \u00e0 une partie de pr\u00e9senter une preuve compl\u00e8te et suffisante, en temps opportun. Corollairement, les principes de justice naturelle commandent aussi l\u2019obligation de ne pas prendre la partie adverse par surprise, une fois que les d\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jou\u00e9s.\n[38] C\u2019est alors en gardant ces principes juridiques \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le Tribunal analysera la pr\u00e9sente demande.\nV. Remarques pr\u00e9liminaires\n[39] Les Forces ont soulev\u00e9 des inqui\u00e9tudes quant au fait que M. Dorais ait ajout\u00e9 \u00e0 sa requ\u00eate les 25 courriels vis\u00e9s par sa demande en r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019instruction afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels, et ce, sans que le Tribunal l\u2019ait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 le faire. Le Tribunal n\u2019a pas l\u2019intention de s\u2019attarder longuement \u00e0 cet argument.\n[40] D\u2019une part, dans son analyse, le Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer notamment l\u2019importance et la pertinence des documents vis\u00e9s par la demande. Pour ce faire, il doit n\u00e9cessairement consulter la documentation en question afin de pouvoir rendre sa d\u00e9cision. Si M. Dorais n\u2019avait pas joint les courriels vis\u00e9s par la demande, le Tribunal lui aurait in\u00e9vitablement demand\u00e9 de les lui transmettre afin qu\u2019il puisse se pencher enti\u00e8rement sur la question et disposer de la requ\u00eate.\n[41] D\u2019autre part, les Forces demandent au Tribunal de radier l\u2019affidavit de M. Dorais dans son enti\u00e8ret\u00e9. Les Forces estiment qu\u2019il s\u2019agit-l\u00e0 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re de fournir du contexte et de la preuve concernant les courriels pour lesquels M. Dorais demande la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate afin de les d\u00e9poser en preuve. Pourtant, les Forces se basent sur cet affidavit dans ses propres repr\u00e9sentations afin de se d\u00e9fendre. Il semble contre-productif que les Forces demandent la radiation d\u2019un affidavit, alors qu\u2019elles se fondent elles-m\u00eames sur cet affidavit pour se d\u00e9fendre et produire une r\u00e9ponse.\n[42] Cela dit, et contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend les Forces, le fait que M. Dorais ait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un affidavit dans lequel il fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux 25 courriels n\u2019est certainement pas une fa\u00e7on d\u2019introduire de la preuve de mani\u00e8re non autoris\u00e9e. L\u2019affidavit et les 25 courriels en question font partie de l\u2019avis de requ\u00eate et du dossier de requ\u00eate. L\u2019affidavit ne constitue en aucun cas de la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience et admise par le Tribunal en tant que tel. Les 25 courriels ne peuvent constituer de la preuve que si le Tribunal accorde la requ\u00eate de M. Dorais et les admet formellement en tant qu\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve (voir notamment 50(3)c) de la LCDP).\n[43] Enfin, M. Dorais a d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur son processus de recrutement et ses d\u00e9marches aupr\u00e8s des diff\u00e9rents d\u00e9partements dans les Forces concernant sa candidature. Si le Tribunal admet les courriels en question, ils seront \u00e9valu\u00e9s au regard du t\u00e9moignage de M. Dorais \u00e0 l\u2019audience, sous r\u00e9serve des plaidoiries additionnelles et de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de rappeler des t\u00e9moins.\nVI. Analyse\n[44] M. Dorais a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une requ\u00eate visant \u00e0 rouvrir l\u2019enqu\u00eate du Tribunal afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels alors que l\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close. Plus sp\u00e9cifiquement, M. Dorais veut d\u00e9poser 25 courriels pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s chronologiquement entre lui et diff\u00e9rentes entit\u00e9s et officiers des Forces, du 4 septembre 2012 au 5 septembre 2016. Il estime que ces documents donneront au Tribunal plus de contexte quant au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa candidature dans les Forces. La Commission consent \u00e0 sa demande alors que les Forces s\u2019y opposent.\n[45] Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a d\u00e9j\u00e0 soulev\u00e9 dans ses instructions aux parties concernant la demande de M. Dorais, une demande en r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019instruction afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels alors que l\u2019instruction est close est une demande rare et exceptionnelle et pour laquelle le Tribunal doit porter une attention particuli\u00e8re et avoir une approche prudente (Montreuil, au par. 16).\nA. La preuve, si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, changerait-elle vraisemblablement le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction de la plainte?\n[46] Quant \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re branche du test, M. Dorais estime que les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire sont pertinents et utiles pour le Tribunal puisqu\u2019ils mettent en exergue le contexte du d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa candidature dans les Forces, son engagement, ses efforts et ses objectifs \u00e0 se joindre \u00e0 nouveau \u00e0 cette organisation. Il croit que ces nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments exerceront une influence significative sur le r\u00e9sultat du dossier, entre autres puisque la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve au Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance lui avait confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019un poste en soins infirmiers \u00e9tait disponible en 2015-2016.\n[47] M. Dorais all\u00e8gue que les Forces ont soulev\u00e9 des doutes quant \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un tel poste durant son contre-interrogatoire \u00e0 l\u2019audience et dans leurs repr\u00e9sentations finales. Selon M. Dorais, il a trouv\u00e9 accidentellement les courriels dans sa boite d\u2019envoi, et non dans sa boite de r\u00e9ception, puisqu\u2019il se souvenait d\u2019avoir eu des interactions avec le caporal-chef Mason et de la possibilit\u00e9 qu\u2019un poste d\u2019agent en soins infirmiers soit disponible pour lui. Il ajoute que la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve du Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance n\u2019aurait pas transf\u00e9r\u00e9 sa candidature au centre de recrutement s\u2019il n\u2019y avait pas eu de poste disponible pour lui. Il argue qu\u2019un candidat doit v\u00e9rifier s\u2019il existe un poste aupr\u00e8s de l\u2019unit\u00e9 de R\u00e9serve des Forces qu\u2019il d\u00e9sire joindre avant de se lancer dans le processus de recrutement.\n[48] Dans la m\u00eame veine, la Commission se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Eastwood, qui a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait probablement un poste d\u2019agent aux soins infirmiers de disponible.\n[49] Finalement, M. Dorais estime que ces courriels sont importants puisque durant l\u2019audience, le Tribunal a entendu de la preuve sur ses efforts d\u00e9ploy\u00e9s quant \u00e0 l\u2019obtention du poste d\u2019agent en soins infirmiers au sein de la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve au 15 Field Ambulance d\u2019Edmonton en 2015 et 2016 et du processus de recrutement tant dans la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve que dans les Forces r\u00e9guli\u00e8res. Selon M. Dorais, les 25 courriels parlent de tout cela, en temps r\u00e9el, et pourraient influencer la d\u00e9cision du Tribunal sur sa r\u00e9clamation pour la perte d\u2019emploi et les pertes de salaires aff\u00e9rents.\n[50] Il ajoute ne pas se souvenir que les Forces aient soulev\u00e9 quelconque probl\u00e8me durant la gestion de dossier quant \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un poste d\u2019agent en soins infirmiers. Il n\u2019avait alors aucune raison de produire des documents \u00e0 ce sujet. Selon sa compr\u00e9hension, une fois la preuve \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, ce qui \u00e9tait sa priorit\u00e9, le fardeau \u00e9tait alors aux Forces de pr\u00e9senter [traduction] \u00ab toutes les autres choses \u00bb, pour reprendre ses mots.\n[51] La Commission est en accord avec M. Dorais. Elle estime que la preuve documentaire est pertinente puisqu\u2019elle permet d\u2019appuyer, d\u2019une part, la position voulant qu\u2019une recrue doive confirmer l\u2019existence d\u2019un poste avant que sa candidature soit accept\u00e9e et, d\u2019autre part, de confirmer l\u2019existence d\u2019un poste d\u2019agent aux soins infirmiers \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve au Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance. Ces courriels appuient donc sa demande pour pertes de salaires.\n[52] La Commission rappelle que M. Dorais a all\u00e9gu\u00e9 qu\u2019un poste d\u2019agent aux soins infirmiers \u00e9tait disponible \u00e0 la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve au 15 Field Ambulance d\u2019Edmonton. Cela dit, les Forces ont argu\u00e9 que M. Dorais n\u2019avait pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve \u00e0 ce sujet et qu\u2019il avait choisi de ne pas appeler quelqu\u2019un de cette R\u00e9serve pour en t\u00e9moigner. La Commission estime donc que ces courriels disposent de la question et que cette preuve additionnelle pourrait exercer une influence sur le r\u00e9sultat de cette affaire.\n[53] Les Forces, quant \u00e0 elles, estime que M. Dorais ne s\u2019est pas d\u00e9charg\u00e9 de son fardeau visant \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer que lesdits documents sont pertinents et convaincants. Les Forces estiment que la pertinence de la preuve additionnelle n\u2019est pas claire en ce que les documents n\u2019abordent pas les questions de la discrimination ou des r\u00e9parations. Selon elles, rien ne d\u00e9montre que M. Dorais aurait re\u00e7u une offre ou une garantie d\u2019emploi ou que les documents contiennent des informations concernant son rang, ses salaires, un nombre d\u2019heures, ou autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments en ce sens. Il n\u2019est pas non plus d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que les personnes impliqu\u00e9es dans le processus de recrutement de M. Dorais sont les auteurs de ces courriels. Selon les Forces, M. Dorais ne veut apporter que du contexte \u00e0 son processus de recrutement, ce qu\u2019il aurait pu faire lors de son t\u00e9moignage en avril 2021. Ce faisant, les Forces estiment que les courriels ne sont pas utiles, ne sont pas pertinents au litige et que leur admission n\u2019aurait pas d\u2019impact significatif sur l\u2019issue de l\u2019affaire.\n[54] Tout d\u2019abord, M. Dorais plaide dans sa requ\u00eate que les documents additionnels dont il demande le d\u00e9p\u00f4t offriront au Tribunal du contexte entourant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa candidature, soulignant son parcours, son engagement, ses objectifs afin de rejoindre \u00e0 nouveau les Forces. Le Tribunal rappelle qu\u2019il ne s\u2019agit pas l\u00e0 des raisons pour lesquelles une r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate peut \u00eatre accord\u00e9e. Il est exceptionnel de permettre \u00e0 une partie de d\u00e9poser des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels une fois que sa preuve a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close et que l\u2019instruction ait \u00e9t\u00e9 conclue. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de bonifier ou de parfaire sa preuve avec des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui ne sont pas pertinents ou qui n\u2019ont aucun impact majeur changeant vraisemblablement le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction de la plainte.\n[55] Le Tribunal a consult\u00e9 les documents de M. Dorais qu\u2019il a not\u00e9 JB-168 \u00e0 JB-192. Une simple r\u00e9vision de ces documents montre d\u2019abord que certains courriels sont redondants et se d\u00e9doublent. D\u2019autre part, il faut ajouter que la pertinence et l\u2019utilit\u00e9 des courriels dont M. Dorais demande le d\u00e9p\u00f4t sont questionnables.\n[56] Rien dans ce qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 consult\u00e9 par le Tribunal dans les documents cot\u00e9s JB-168 \u00e0 JB-192 n\u2019est une grande surprise. Pour certains documents, il s\u2019agit d\u2019\u00e9changes de courriels entre M. Dorais et d\u2019autres officiers au sein des Forces, dans diff\u00e9rents d\u00e9partements, alors qu\u2019il tentait de d\u00e9couvrir s\u2019il y avait un poste en soins infirmiers de disponible. D\u2019autres de ces \u00e9changes sont simplement des r\u00e9ponses automatis\u00e9es du syst\u00e8me de d\u00e9p\u00f4t de candidature ou des suivis sur la progression de sa candidature au sein des Forces, ce qui en diminue grandement l\u2019utilit\u00e9 et la pertinence.\n[57] De plus, il faut noter que M. Dorais a d\u00e9j\u00e0 t\u00e9moign\u00e9 sur le sujet et a \u00e9t\u00e9 contre-interrog\u00e9 sur ces aspects. Aussi, d\u2019autres t\u00e9moins, dont Mme Eastwood, ont notamment fourni leur compr\u00e9hension sur la question \u00e0 savoir si un candidat doit entreprendre des d\u00e9marches au pr\u00e9alable afin de d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a un poste de disponible avant de d\u00e9poser sa candidature.\n[58] Cela dit, la fiabilit\u00e9 des courriels n\u2019est pas remise en question. Mais force est de constater que la preuve qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience par les diff\u00e9rents t\u00e9moignages a d\u00e9j\u00e0 abord\u00e9 tout cette question.\n[59] Il ne s\u2019agit pas alors, dans notre cas, d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuves additionnels qui pourraient vraisemblablement changer le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instance. Ici, M. Dorais tente plut\u00f4t d\u2019appuyer, par des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels et non divulgu\u00e9s, la preuve qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9j\u00e0 soumise par voie testimoniale durant l\u2019audience.\n[60] Les courriels ne constituent pas des documents qui \u00e9taient inconnus de tous ; ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 identifi\u00e9s par M. Dorais \u00e0 travers sa propre boite de courriel. Plut\u00f4t, les documents ne font que corroborer son propre t\u00e9moignage d\u00e9pos\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[61] Ce faisant, le Tribunal est d\u2019avis qu\u2019\u00e0 la question \u00ab la preuve, si elle \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e, changerait-elle vraisemblablement le r\u00e9sultat \u00bb de l\u2019instruction de la plainte, la r\u00e9ponse est non.\nB. La preuve pouvait-elle \u00eatre obtenue avant l\u2019instruction de la plainte en exer\u00e7ant une diligence raisonnable?\n[62] M. Dorais affirme que ces nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve n\u2019ont pu \u00eatre obtenus avec diligence raisonnable avant les audiences. \u00c0 cet effet, il affirme que c\u2019est le 9 mai 2022 qu\u2019il a d\u00e9couvert les 25 courriels en question dat\u00e9s entre le 4 septembre 2012 et le 5 septembre 2016, alors qu\u2019il passait le temps dans sa voiture \u00e0 consulter sa boite de courriels. Il a expliqu\u00e9 que c\u2019est en fouillant dans sa boite d\u2019envoi de courriels qu\u2019il a retrouv\u00e9 ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments et non dans sa boite de r\u00e9ception.\n[63] M. Dorais affirme que s\u2019il avait \u00e9t\u00e9 repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat, ce dernier aurait pu l\u2019assister \u00e9galement dans la pr\u00e9paration de son dossier.\n[64] Il ajoute aussi que lorsque la Commission avait fait une demande de divulgation aux Forces visant le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de sa candidature, notamment des courriels qu\u2019elles auraient pu avoir \u00e0 ce sujet, les Forces ont r\u00e9pondu que ces courriels ne pouvaient \u00eatre produits. Plut\u00f4t, les Forces l\u2019ont invit\u00e9 \u00e0 divulguer de tels courriels entre lui et les employ\u00e9s des Forces s\u2019il en avait acc\u00e8s. M. Dorais estime que les efforts des Forces dans la divulgation ont \u00e9t\u00e9 aussi m\u00e9diocres que les siens.\n[65] Dans la m\u00eame veine, la Commission all\u00e8gue que les Forces n\u2019ont effectivement pas divulgu\u00e9 ces courriels entre ses employ\u00e9s et M. Dorais. De plus, le dossier de recrutement de M. Dorais, en version papier, a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par l\u2019intim\u00e9e en mars 2020. \u00c0 cet effet, la Commission se r\u00e9f\u00e8re au t\u00e9moignage de Mme Eastwood, qui a expliqu\u00e9 qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas re\u00e7u de demande visant \u00e0 retenir le dossier de recrutement de M. Dorais afin de pr\u00e9server la preuve en raison de l\u2019existence d\u2019un litige en cours. Elle a confirm\u00e9 que le dossier a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit par des employ\u00e9s subalternes. La Commission pr\u00e9cise cependant que, comme l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 Mme Eastwood, sous l\u2019ancien syst\u00e8me informatique, la politique aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019imprimer les courriels et les ajouter au dossier de recrutement.\n[66] Les Forces, quant \u00e0 elle, arguent que M. Dorais n\u2019a pas fourni d\u2019explications raisonnables concernant le d\u00e9lai marqu\u00e9 relatif \u00e0 la production de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuves. Comme M. Dorais a mentionn\u00e9 qu\u2019il a trouv\u00e9 ces courriels le 9 mai 2022 alors qu\u2019il fouillait dans les courriels de son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone pour passer le temps, les Forces affirment alors qu\u2019il avait le contr\u00f4le et la possession de ces documents \u00e0 tous moments pertinents en l\u2019instance.\n[67] Les Forces ajoutent qu\u2019en avril 2021, durant le contre-interrogatoire de M. Dorais, ce dernier a vu qu\u2019elles ont soulev\u00e9 des doutes quant \u00e0 la disponibilit\u00e9 d\u2019un poste d\u2019agent aux soins infirmiers au sein de son organisation. Dans une lettre dat\u00e9e du 23 juin 2021, les Forces avaient affirm\u00e9 que le litige se concentrait sur les actions et les d\u00e9cisions de l\u2019officier m\u00e9dical ayant pris la d\u00e9cision quant \u00e0 son recrutement et non sur les processus de mise en candidature du centre de recrutement lui-m\u00eame. Dans cette correspondance, les Forces avaient invit\u00e9 M. Dorais \u00e0 d\u00e9poser les courriels qu\u2019il aurait en sa possession entre lui et les diff\u00e9rents employ\u00e9s de l\u2019organisation et dont il estimait pertinents. Les Forces croient que M. Dorais aurait donc d\u00fb \u00eatre avis\u00e9 de chercher dans ses courriels s\u2019il estimait qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient pertinents au litige. Contrairement \u00e0 ce que pr\u00e9tend M. Dorais en mentionnant que leurs efforts quant \u00e0 la production des courriels de ses employ\u00e9s ont \u00e9t\u00e9 m\u00e9diocres, les Forces affirment avoir distribu\u00e9 les courriels pertinents au litige. Elles n\u2019ont alors pas conc\u00e9d\u00e9 que les courriels du centre de recrutement \u00e9taient, dans les faits, pertinents.\n[68] Les Forces plaident \u00e9galement que les anciennes R\u00e8gles, lesquelles s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019instance, pr\u00e9voient que les parties ont droit \u00e0 une preuve pleine et enti\u00e8re ; les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et les arguments doivent \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s de mani\u00e8re efficace et en temps opportun (r\u00e8gle 1 des anciennes R\u00e8gles).\n[69] Elles ajoutent que le paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP pr\u00e9voit qu\u2019elles avaient le droit de recevoir un avis, de comparaitre pleinement et enti\u00e8rement et de pr\u00e9senter ses \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve et observations. Consid\u00e9rant le d\u00e9lai occasionn\u00e9 par M. Dorais, les Forces arguent qu\u2019il ne serait pas exp\u00e9ditif de lui permettre d\u2019utiliser le processus de cette mani\u00e8re afin de d\u00e9poser de nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[70] De plus, bien que les Forces jugent que les courriels en question ne soient pas pertinents ni convaincants, elles all\u00e8guent que M. Dorais savait qu\u2019il avait l\u2019obligation, selon les R\u00e8gles de proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal, de divulguer les documents pertinents \u00e0 son litige (R\u00e8gles 6(1)d),(4),(5) et 9(3) des anciennes R\u00e8gles). Si M. Dorais croyait que ces documents \u00e9taient pertinents, les Forces estiment qu\u2019il aurait pu les lister dans sa liste de documents et les divulguer. Elles ajoutent que la R\u00e8gle 9(3) des ancienne R\u00e8gles emp\u00eache une partie de se baser sur des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non divulgu\u00e9s. La seule exception est si cela respecte les objectifs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s \u00e0 la R\u00e8gle 1(1) des anciennes R\u00e8gles, et si cela est autoris\u00e9 par le Tribunal, auquel cas il offrira alors aux autres parties la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019y r\u00e9pondre.\n[71] Les Forces croient que M. Dorais n\u2019a pas fait preuve de diligence raisonnable et avait toute la latitude pour fournir les documents qu\u2019il estimait pertinents. Ainsi, lorsqu\u2019il a divulgu\u00e9 durant l\u2019audience en juillet 2021 des courriels relativement \u00e0 son processus de recrutement, il aurait d\u00fb effectuer une recherche diligente dans sa boite de courriels afin d\u2019y trouver les 25 courriels.\n[72] \u00c0 ce sujet, les Forces attirent l\u2019attention du Tribunal \u00e0 Whyte, Kasha c. Canadian National Railway, 2010 TCDP 6 (CanLII) [Whyte] en affirmant que le Tribunal, dans cette cause, avait rejet\u00e9 la demande la partie intim\u00e9e de rouvrir l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur le simple fondement que cette derni\u00e8re avait acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l\u2019information en question avant et durant l\u2019audience et qu\u2019elle aurait pu l\u2019obtenir en faisant preuve de diligence raisonnable. Elles font aussi r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 Canada (Human Rights Comm.) v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 18406 (TCDP), dans laquelle le Tribunal a aussi rejet\u00e9 la demande de r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la partie intim\u00e9e puisqu\u2019elle aurait pu obtenir les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve si elle avait agi avec diligence raisonnable. Tout comme dans ces dossiers, les Forces arguent que le manque de diligence raisonnable de la part de M. Dorais devrait emp\u00eacher la r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[73] Au vu des arguments des parties, le Tribunal consid\u00e8re qu\u2019effectivement, la preuve documentaire additionnelle de M. Dorais aurait pu \u00eatre obtenue bien avant l\u2019instruction, voire durant l\u2019instruction, s\u2019il avait agi avec diligence raisonnable puisque ces courriels se retrouvaient dans sa boite d'envoi ou de r\u00e9ception Outlook.\n[74] La mani\u00e8re dont les documents ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retrouv\u00e9s par M. Dorais et comment il les a retrouv\u00e9s \u2013 alors qu\u2019il \u00e9tait dans sa voiture, \u00e0 passer le temps, d\u00e9filant ses courriels de sa boite Outlook \u2013 appuie l\u2019id\u00e9e que ces \u00e9changes de courriels entre lui et diff\u00e9rentes entit\u00e9s et officiers des Forces \u00e9taient facilement retra\u00e7ables et auraient pu \u00eatre divulgu\u00e9s bien avant l\u2019audience, voire durant l\u2019audience. De ce fait, une diligence raisonnable aurait pu lui permettre de divulguer cette documentation aux autres parties.\n[75] D\u2019autre part, m\u00eame si M. Dorais indique qu\u2019il n\u2019avait pas r\u00e9ellement saisi que la question quant \u00e0 sa recherche pr\u00e9alable d\u2019un poste en soins infirmiers au sein des Forces \u00e9tait un point litigieux, il a tout de m\u00eame \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 ce sujet et d\u2019informer le Tribunal de ses d\u00e9marches. Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de partager les souvenirs qu\u2019il avait de ses \u00e9changes avec diff\u00e9rents agents des Forces et de les nommer. M. Dorais avait l\u2019occasion \u00e0 ce temps de d\u00e9poser la documentation qui \u00e9tait aff\u00e9rente \u00e0 son t\u00e9moignage, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait.\n[76] Dans ses repr\u00e9sentations, il a partag\u00e9 s'\u00eatre souvenu que durant son contre-interrogatoire, alors qu\u2019il r\u00e9pondait \u00e0 des questions concernant la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve au Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance, la question des courriels relatifs aux recrutements avec la R\u00e9serve est venue sur le sujet. Toujours dans ses repr\u00e9sentations, M. Dorais a aussi mentionn\u00e9 que durant son contre-interrogatoire, il a pens\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait peut-\u00eatre trop tard pour d\u00e9poser certains documents dont il avait possession.\n[77] M. Dorais n\u2019a pas demand\u00e9 au Tribunal l\u2019autorisation de d\u00e9poser les courriels en question et qui concernent ses d\u00e9marches pr\u00e9liminaires avec le centre de recrutement et la Premi\u00e8re R\u00e9serve au Edmonton 15 Field Ambulance. Les seules pi\u00e8ces d\u00e9pos\u00e9es \u00e0 cet effet sont JB-136 et JB-137, soit des \u00e9changes avec Mme Mason du centre de recrutement.\n[78] Cela pr\u00e9suppose que M. Dorais se souvenait que des courriels ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9chang\u00e9s entre lui et divers officiers des Forces. Cependant, il n\u2019explique pas pourquoi il n\u2019a pas pris les d\u00e9marches raisonnables afin de les chercher et de les r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer dans sa propre boite de courriels.\n[79] Pourtant, il a bien d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les pi\u00e8ces JB-136 et JB-137. Ces deux pi\u00e8ces sont des \u00e9changes de courriels entre lui et Mme Mason. Ces pi\u00e8ces se situent dans la p\u00e9riode o\u00f9 M. Dorais tentait de d\u00e9couvrir s\u2019il y avait un poste en soins infirmiers de disponible. Pourtant, il n\u2019a joint aucun des autres courriels, se situant dans la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode pertinente.\n[80] Le Tribunal est surpris que M. Dorais ait aussi inclus les pi\u00e8ces JB-136 et JB-137 dans la pr\u00e9sente demande en r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019enqu\u00eate, mais les a plut\u00f4t cot\u00e9es JB-189 et JB-190. Pourtant, le Tribunal constate qu\u2019il s\u2019agit effectivement des m\u00eames courriels que ceux qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience, sous les c\u00f4tes JB-136 et JB-137.\n[81] Le Tribunal se demande alors pourquoi M. Dorais n\u2019a pas distribu\u00e9 l\u2019ensemble des courriels entre lui, les Forces, ses officiers et le centre de recrutement, au m\u00eame moment o\u00f9 il a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 les pi\u00e8ces JB-136 et JB-137. Le Tribunal aurait pu traiter une telle demande en temps et lieu, \u00e0 l\u2019audience.\n[82] Ainsi, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont M. Dorais demande le d\u00e9p\u00f4t ne sont pas nouveaux et le Tribunal n\u2019est pas convaincu qu\u2019il s\u2019agisse de documents dont M. Dorais ne connaissait pas du tout l\u2019existence. Comme le Tribunal l\u2019a explicit\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment, M. Dorais \u00e9tait une partie \u00e0 ces conversations avec les Forces et se souvient de ces \u00e9changes avec elles, ses officiers et le centre de recrutement. Tel que mentionn\u00e9 plus haut, il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des documents similaires, dans la m\u00eame p\u00e9riode pertinente. Il \u00e9tait alors de sa responsabilit\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer ses recherches de mani\u00e8re diligente et de retrouver les documents qui appuyait ses pr\u00e9tentions.\n[83] Quant \u00e0 l\u2019argument que M. Dorais n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, il faut noter que bien que non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9, M. Dorais a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de mener \u00e0 terme son dossier. Le Tribunal comprend tr\u00e8s bien qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par avocat dans la proc\u00e9dure et qu\u2019effectivement, les services d\u2019un avocat ou d\u2019un conseiller juridique sont utiles et souhaitables. Toutefois, ce service n\u2019est pas accessible \u00e0 tous.\n[84] Cependant, nous ne pouvons pas pr\u00e9tendre qu\u2019une repr\u00e9sentation par avocat de M. Dorais aurait n\u00e9cessairement engendr\u00e9 la d\u00e9couverte, la distribution ou le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des courriels en question dans le dossier du Tribunal. La pr\u00e9sence d\u2019un avocat et ce qui aurait pu se produire demeure sp\u00e9culative.\n[85] De plus, le Tribunal note que tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure, M. Dorais avait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 qu\u2019il \u00e9tait en mesure de comprendre la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal et les obligations qu\u2019il avait \u00e0 rencontrer ; cela inclut entre autres la divulgation des documents potentiellement au dossier.\n[86] Il a \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de produire son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, divulguer les documents potentiellement pertinents \u00e0 son litige, de cr\u00e9er sa liste de pi\u00e8ces pour l\u2019audience, convoquer ses t\u00e9moins, etc. Bien que non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9 et n\u2019ayant pas de formation juridique, M. Dorais a d\u00e9montr\u00e9 les habilet\u00e9s et aptitudes n\u00e9cessaires et ad\u00e9quates pour saisir g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement ses droits et obligations dans notre processus quasi judiciaire.\n[87] Il faut \u00e9galement faire mention que la Commission a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Bien qu\u2019elle ne repr\u00e9sent\u00e2t pas M. Dorais, la Commission l\u2019a accompagn\u00e9 tout au long de la proc\u00e9dure, ce qui n\u2019est pas non plus une consid\u00e9ration \u00e0 n\u00e9gliger.\n[88] Le Tribunal doit accompagner les parties non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9es dans la proc\u00e9dure afin qu\u2019elles comprennent ce qu\u2019elles doivent accomplir et qu\u2019elles soient en mesure de pr\u00e9senter leur dossier de mani\u00e8re significative (paragraphe 50(1) de la LCDP; voir aussi Conseil canadien de la magistrature, \u00c9nonc\u00e9 de principes concernant les plaideurs et les accus\u00e9s non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par un avocat, CCM 2006, \u00e0 l\u2019adresse https:\/\/cjc-ccm.ca\/sites\/default\/files\/documents\/2020\/Final-Enonce-de-principes.pdf, ent\u00e9rin\u00e9 par la Cour supr\u00eame dans Pintea c. Johns, 2017 CSC 23).\n[89] Toutefois, \u00eatre non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e ne donne pas non plus un passe-droit \u00e0 un fardeau ou une charge de la preuve moins \u00e9lev\u00e9e pour la partie sans avocat ou sans conseiller juridique, et ce, au d\u00e9triment du fardeau qui doit \u00eatre rencontr\u00e9 par les parties adverses. Cela cr\u00e9erait n\u00e9cessairement une iniquit\u00e9 dans la proc\u00e9dure si c\u2019\u00e9tait le cas.\n[90] Ici, les documents de M. Dorais \u00e9taient en sa possession et facilement accessibles avec une simple recherche dans ses courriels. Il semble \u00e9galement qu\u2019il \u00e9tait au courant que des courriels pouvaient exister ; il a, d\u2019ailleurs, d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des courriels entre lui et Mme Masson sous les c\u00f4tes JB-136 et JB-137, qui sont repris par les c\u00f4tes JB-188 et JB-189 relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate. Ces documents auraient pu \u00eatre distribu\u00e9s avant voire au moins, pendant l\u2019audience (Whyte, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9). Il \u00e9tait de la responsabilit\u00e9 de M. Dorais d\u2019effectuer pr\u00e9alablement ses recherches de mani\u00e8re suffisamment diligente et de communiquer les documents qui \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinents au dossier. Le Tribunal conclut donc que la deuxi\u00e8me branche du test n\u2019est pas remplie.\n[91] La question \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape-ci est de d\u00e9terminer si la personne qui demande le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s la fermeture de la preuve et de l\u2019instruction a agi avec diligence raisonnable afin d\u2019obtenir la preuve. Le fardeau revient \u00e0 M. Dorais de convaincre le Tribunal qu\u2019il a agi avec diligence raisonnable afin d\u2019obtenir ladite preuve, ce qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 en mesure de d\u00e9montrer.\n[92] La question de la destruction du dossier de recrutement de M. Dorais, soulev\u00e9 par la Commission, sera trait\u00e9e ci-bas dans la section des circonstances exceptionnelles puisque le Tribunal juge que c\u2019est \u00e0 ce moment-l\u00e0 que l\u2019analyse de cet \u00e9l\u00e9ment s\u2019y pr\u00eate le mieux.\nC. Existe-t-il des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant que le Tribunal exerce son pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire afin d\u2019admettre les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve additionnels?\n[93] La Commission estime que le Tribunal d\u00e9tient la discr\u00e9tion r\u00e9siduelle de rouvrir l\u2019instruction, m\u00eame s\u2019il en venait \u00e0 la conclusion que le crit\u00e8re de la diligence raisonnable n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 respect\u00e9. Elle croit que le fait qu\u2019une organisation gouvernementale ne pr\u00e9serve pas la preuve bien apr\u00e8s que le litige est d\u00e9but\u00e9 constitue des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant l\u2019exercice du pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire du Tribunal afin de rouvrir l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[94] La Commission croit que les Forces ont manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 leur diligence de pr\u00e9server le dossier papier de recrutement de M. Dorais. Elle affirme que comme l\u2019a confirm\u00e9 Mme Eastwood, les courriels auraient \u00e9t\u00e9 vers\u00e9s dans le dossier de recrutement de M. Dorais. Ces courriels auraient aussi pu se retrouver dans les boites courriel des employ\u00e9s en question, mais les Forces n\u2019ont pas pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 de preuve voulant que ses employ\u00e9s aient \u00e9t\u00e9 contact\u00e9s afin de v\u00e9rifier s\u2019ils avaient acc\u00e8s \u00e0 ces courriels.\n[95] La Commission ajoute qu\u2019il n\u2019y aura aucun pr\u00e9judice pour les Forces si ces courriels sont admis puisque ceux-ci auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre en leur possession. Elle croit que ce faisant, l\u2019int\u00e9grit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction est maintenue, que le d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire est mitig\u00e9, et que dans les circonstances o\u00f9 la d\u00e9cision finale n\u2019a pas encore \u00e9t\u00e9 rendue, l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et de l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale quant \u00e0 la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019instruction l\u2019emporte sur le principe de la finalit\u00e9.\n[96] Les Forces all\u00e8guent que la r\u00e9ouverture de l\u2019instruction afin d\u2019y d\u00e9poser les nouveaux \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve cr\u00e9era des d\u00e9lais et des co\u00fbts suppl\u00e9mentaires. Elles ajoutent que dans le cours normal des proc\u00e9dures, les parties auraient eu l\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de pr\u00e9senter des arguments afin de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. Ce faisant, la valeur probante des documents de M. Dorais doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e.\n[97] Les Forces ajoutent qu\u2019elles subiront un pr\u00e9judice avec l\u2019admission de ces documents, car leur d\u00e9fense au dossier se fondait sur l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de M. Dorais, les documents divulgu\u00e9s et les t\u00e9moignages pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s. Sans que M. Dorais puisse d\u00e9montrer la pertinence, l\u2019effet convaincant des documents et leur valeur probante, les Forces plaident qu\u2019il serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice de les admettre en preuve apr\u00e8s la conclusion de l\u2019instruction. Enfin, elles arguent qu\u2019\u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des facteurs oppos\u00e9s qui sont significatifs, le principe de la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ne requiert pas l\u2019admission de ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve afin de confirmer d\u2019autres \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve.\n[98] Dans le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, existe-t-il des circonstances exceptionnelles justifiant que le Tribunal exerce sa discr\u00e9tion r\u00e9siduelle et d\u2019admettre les documents additionnels bien que l\u2019instruction soit close? Le Tribunal r\u00e9pond par la n\u00e9gative.\n[99] Consid\u00e9rant que les documents en question ne changeraient vraisemblablement pas le r\u00e9sultat de l\u2019instruction, que leur importance et pertinence sont mitig\u00e9es, et que M. Dorais aurait pu y avoir acc\u00e8s facilement en consultant sa boite de courriels Outlook, le Tribunal ne croit pas que les circonstances justifient qu\u2019il use de sa discr\u00e9tion afin d\u2019admettre les documents additionnels.\n[100] D\u2019autre part, le fait que le dossier de recruitement de M. Dorais ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit de mani\u00e8re pr\u00e9caire par des agents des Forces alors qu\u2019un litige \u00e9tait en cours ou anticip\u00e9 n\u2019est pas suffisant, dans le cas en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, afin de justifier que le Tribunal use de sa discr\u00e9tion pour admettre ces documents.\n[101] D\u2019abord, le Tribunal rappelle que la bonne foi se pr\u00e9sume en droit (Robinson c. Forces arm\u00e9es canadiennes, 1991-07-04, T.D. 9\/91, \u00e0 la p. 19; Nur c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2019 TCDP 5, au par. 139; Valenti c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique, 2017 TCDP 25, para. 26 (tableau); Bhasin v. Hrynew, 2014 SCC 71).\n[102] C\u2019est \u00e0 la partie qui soul\u00e8ve la mauvaise foi d\u2019une autre partie d\u2019en prouver l\u2019existence. Rien dans la preuve, ni dans les repr\u00e9sentations de la Commission ou de M. Dorais ne convainquent le Tribunal que les Forces, ou ses officiers, ont d\u00e9truit le dossier de candidature de M. Dorais de mani\u00e8re intentionnelle ou de mauvaise foi, voire en faisant preuve d\u2019une n\u00e9gligence grossi\u00e8re.\n[103] Mme Eastwood est venue t\u00e9moigner devant le Tribunal de mani\u00e8re ouverte sur la destruction du dossier et a expliqu\u00e9 les circonstances menant \u00e0 sa destruction. Elle a effectivement reconnu que cela n\u2019aurait pas d\u00fb se produire et qu\u2019il existe des lacunes dans la proc\u00e9dure de conservation des dossiers dans le cas d\u2019un litige. Mme Eastwood a admis qu\u2019il y avait des le\u00e7ons \u00e0 tirer de la situation et que des corrections s\u2019imposent.\n[104] Malgr\u00e9 qu\u2019effectivement, le dossier de candidature de M. Dorais \u2013 qui auraient pu potentiellement inclure les courriels en question \u2013 ait \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9truit, les courriels \u00e9taient tout de m\u00eame en la possession de M. Dorais, et ce, bien avant le d\u00e9but de la proc\u00e9dure du Tribunal. Comme pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment expliqu\u00e9, ces documents \u00e9taient facilement retra\u00e7ables et accessibles par ce dernier avec une simple recherche dans sa boite de courriels.\n[105] Quant au pr\u00e9judice, le Tribunal rappelle que le fait d\u2019accorder une demande visant \u00e0 ajouter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve apr\u00e8s que l\u2019enqu\u00eate a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close est une mesure exceptionnelle. Il ne s\u2019agit pas de simplement ajouter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments apr\u00e8s le fait, une fois les d\u00e9s jou\u00e9s, sans autre formalit\u00e9. Il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice et de la saine administration de la justice qu\u2019une fois que l\u2019enqu\u00eate est d\u00e9clar\u00e9e close, les cours et les tribunaux puissent prendre le dossier en d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 et rendre une d\u00e9cision avec la preuve d\u00e9pos\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019audience. Cela respecte le principe de finalit\u00e9 (Varco, au par. 15). La r\u00e9ouverture d\u2019une enqu\u00eate est, de mani\u00e8re inh\u00e9rente, une atteinte \u00e0 ces principes et le Tribunal doit faire preuve d\u2019une grande prudence et n\u2019accorder ce genre de demande que dans des cas rares et clairs.\n[106] Dans le pr\u00e9sent cas, la recherche de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 ne supplante par le principe de la finalit\u00e9 des d\u00e9bats, consid\u00e9rant le pr\u00e9judice notamment en termes de temps et co\u00fbts qui sera caus\u00e9 par la r\u00e9ouverture du d\u00e9bat, que l\u2019importance et la pertinence des documents sont mitig\u00e9s, que les documents ne changeraient vraisemblablement pas l\u2019issue de l\u2019instruction et que M. Dorais pouvait facilement y avoir acc\u00e8s en agissant avec diligence raisonnable.\nVII.

Lustig\nI. CONTEXTE\n[1] Il s\u2019agit d\u2019une d\u00e9cision sur une requ\u00eate pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par l\u2019intim\u00e9 le 17 novembre 2022 en vue d\u2019obtenir une ordonnance de rejet de la plainte en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce pour cause de retard, conform\u00e9ment aux articles 9 et 26 des R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (les \u00ab R\u00e8gles \u00bb). La seule question dans l\u2019affaire consiste \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer si la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e pour cause de retard de la part de la plaignante.\n[2] La plaignante s\u2019identifie comme une femme autochtone transgenre. Dans sa plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e le 9 ao\u00fbt 2017, elle all\u00e8gue que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a commis envers elle un acte discriminatoire aux termes des articles 5 et 14.1 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne (la \u00ab Loi \u00bb). Elle all\u00e8gue avoir subi un traitement d\u00e9favorable en raison de sa race et de son identit\u00e9 ou expression de genre, ainsi que des repr\u00e9sailles pour avoir pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne aupr\u00e8s de la Commission en 2014, dont le r\u00e8glement a eu lieu en janvier 2017. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, elle all\u00e8gue avoir fait l\u2019objet, le 26 mai 2017, d\u2019un incident impliquant un recours excessif \u00e0 la force contre elle, au cours duquel elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 forc\u00e9e de se doucher nue devant plusieurs hommes et deux femmes.\n[3] Elle est incarc\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9tablissement de La Macaza et n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par avocat; elle agit plut\u00f4t avec l\u2019aide de son conjoint, Noel McCallum, qui y est aussi incarc\u00e9r\u00e9.\n[4] Suivant les instructions du Tribunal, la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions le 28 juin 2021. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la plaignante a indiqu\u00e9 que ce dernier \u00e9tait incomplet et a demand\u00e9 d\u2019y ajouter d\u2019autres listes de documents en sa possession qui, selon elle, \u00e9taient potentiellement pertinents et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard desquels elle n\u2019invoquait aucun privil\u00e8ge de non-divulgation. L\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions comportait des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles il y avait eu, apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident survenu le 26 mai 2017 et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de la plainte, un continuum d\u2019actes de harc\u00e8lement et de repr\u00e9sailles, y compris des incidents all\u00e9gu\u00e9s impliquant des abus contre la plaignante et M. McCallum de la part d\u2019agents. Certains de ces incidents sont d\u00e9crits dans l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions comme \u00e9tant [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9lictueux et criminels \u00bb.\n[5] Le 22 juin 2021, en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante, le Tribunal lui a accord\u00e9 un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire jusqu\u2019au 16 ao\u00fbt 2021 pour d\u00e9poser les autres renseignements de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions. Par la suite, \u00e0 cinq autres reprises, le Tribunal a prorog\u00e9 le d\u00e9lai pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 en r\u00e9ponse aux demandes pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la plaignante comme suit : le 10 ao\u00fbt 2021 jusqu\u2019au 15 novembre 2021; le 29 novembre 2021 jusqu\u2019au 10 janvier 2022; le 28 mars 2022 jusqu\u2019au 28 juillet 2022; le 2 ao\u00fbt 2022 jusqu\u2019au 30 septembre 2022, en indiquant que [traduction] \u00ab toute autre demande de prorogation pourrait \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e \u00bb. Aucune de ces prorogations n\u2019a donn\u00e9 lieu au d\u00e9p\u00f4t de l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 par la plaignante, bien que le Tribunal ait expliqu\u00e9 aux parties que, tant que l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions n\u2019\u00e9tait pas complet, l\u2019affaire ne pouvait \u00eatre poursuivie, car l\u2019intim\u00e9 devait avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions complet pour y r\u00e9pondre et pour d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il demandait une ordonnance de radiation des all\u00e9gations d\u00e9passant la port\u00e9e de la plainte.\n[6] Pendant toute cette p\u00e9riode, bien qu\u2019il ne se soit pas oppos\u00e9 aux prorogations susmentionn\u00e9es, l\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est plaint au sujet de la demande d\u2019augmentation potentielle de la port\u00e9e de la plainte et de l\u2019incidence n\u00e9gative du retard dans le dossier caus\u00e9 par le d\u00e9faut de la plaignante de respecter les d\u00e9lais de d\u00e9p\u00f4t. Il s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 au r\u00f4le propos\u00e9 de M. McCallum \u00e0 titre de repr\u00e9sentant et de t\u00e9moin de la plaignante. Il a contest\u00e9 les affirmations de la plaignante selon lesquelles son retard dans l\u2019obtention et le d\u00e9p\u00f4t des renseignements demand\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9lais s\u2019expliquait par un manque d\u2019acc\u00e8s aux ordinateurs de son \u00e9tablissement et de temps pour les utiliser. Il a fourni des informations montrant que la plaignante avait acc\u00e8s aux ordinateurs et disposait d\u2019amplement de temps pour les utiliser \u00e0 ces fins, mais qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019a pas fait, et a cit\u00e9 d\u2019autres occasions o\u00f9 la plaignante aurait pu y acc\u00e9der et les utiliser au del\u00e0 de la proc\u00e9dure normale, mais qu\u2019elle ne l\u2019a pas fait. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est aussi plaint que, \u00e0 de nombreuses reprises, la plaignante ne l\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 de ses demandes de prorogation des d\u00e9lais de d\u00e9p\u00f4t ni ne lui a envoy\u00e9 une copie de celles-ci et n\u2019a pas r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 sa correspondance, notamment lorsqu\u2019il lui a offert de l\u2019aider \u00e0 obtenir les documents dont elle all\u00e9guait avoir besoin pour achever son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\n[7] Le 22 septembre 2022, le Tribunal a re\u00e7u une autre demande verbale de la part de M. McCallum visant \u00e0 obtenir une autre prorogation jusqu\u2019en janvier 2023, une demande justifi\u00e9e, une fois de plus, par le manque de temps d\u2019utilisation des ordinateurs. L\u2019intim\u00e9 s\u2019est oppos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette demande. La Commission a \u00e9crit qu\u2019une prorogation [traduction] \u00ab de deux semaines \u00e9tait raisonnable \u00bb. Le Tribunal a accord\u00e9 une prorogation jusqu\u2019au 14 octobre 2022 et a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019il [traduction] \u00ab s\u2019attend \u00e0 ce qu\u2019aucune autre prorogation ne soit accord\u00e9e \u00bb. Le 14 octobre 2022, M. McCallum a communiqu\u00e9 avec le greffe du Tribunal pour l\u2019informer que la date du 14 octobre ne serait pas respect\u00e9e et qu\u2019un d\u00e9lai suppl\u00e9mentaire jusqu\u2019en 2023 \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire. Il a re\u00e7u l\u2019instruction de pr\u00e9senter une demande par \u00e9crit indiquant les motifs de la demande, mais, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, il ne l\u2019a pas fait.\n[8] Le 25 novembre 2022, \u00e0 la suite de l\u2019introduction de la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate de l\u2019intim\u00e9, le Tribunal a donn\u00e9 des instructions aux parties selon lesquelles la plaignante et la Commission avaient jusqu\u2019au 16 janvier 2023 pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 la requ\u00eate. Dans la correspondance dat\u00e9e des 20 et 29 d\u00e9cembre 2022, la plaignante a accus\u00e9 r\u00e9ception au Tribunal du d\u00e9lai du 16 janvier 2023 pour d\u00e9poser une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate et a indiqu\u00e9 [traduction] \u00ab qu[\u2019elle] respecter[a] le d\u00e9lai du 16 janvier 2023 pour l\u2019\u00e9laboration de la d\u00e9claration de point de vue qui [lui] a \u00e9t\u00e9 demand\u00e9e \u00bb. \u00c0 ce jour, la plaignante n\u2019a ni r\u00e9pondu \u00e0 la requ\u00eate, ni d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, ni communiqu\u00e9 avec le Tribunal depuis sa derni\u00e8re correspondance. Le 13 janvier 2023, la Commission a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 des observations en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate.\nII. D\u00c9CISION\n[9] Puisque la plaignante n\u2019a tenu absolument aucun compte des d\u00e9lais du Tribunal, la plainte doit \u00eatre rejet\u00e9e.\nOBSERVATIONS DE L\u2019INTIM\u00c9\n[10] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que, apr\u00e8s plus de 18 mois de prorogations pendant lesquels la plaignante n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 les d\u00e9lais pour le d\u00e9p\u00f4t de son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, il est dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat de la justice que le Tribunal rejette la plainte pour cause de retard. Le Tribunal a le pouvoir de contr\u00f4ler sa proc\u00e9dure et il doit emp\u00eacher les abus et s\u2019assurer que les parties respectent les d\u00e9lais fix\u00e9s (voir Chisholm c. Halifax Employers Association, 2019 TCDP 38 au par. 15 [Chisholm]).\n[11] L\u2019intim\u00e9 cite le paragraphe 48.9(1) de la Loi, qui stipule que l\u2019instruction des plaintes se fait de fa\u00e7on exp\u00e9ditive dans le respect des principes de justice naturelle et des r\u00e8gles de pratique. Il cite aussi les articles 9 et 10 des R\u00e8gles qui indiquent que le Tribunal peut rejeter une plainte pour omission de se conformer \u00e0 un d\u00e9lai fix\u00e9 sous le r\u00e9gime des R\u00e8gles ou, de sa propre initiative ou sur requ\u00eate d\u2019une partie, rendre l\u2019ordonnance qu\u2019il estime n\u00e9cessaire en cas d\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure\n[12] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que les deux crit\u00e8res juridiques applicables (le \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb et le \u00ab crit\u00e8re de Seitz \u00bb) sont satisfaits pour que sa requ\u00eate de rejet de la plainte pour cause de retard soit accept\u00e9e, bien qu\u2019un seul des crit\u00e8res n\u2019ait \u00e0 l\u2019\u00eatre pour y parvenir. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, il cite Chisholm, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, aux paragraphes 17, 18 et 19.\n[13] Dans le cadre du \u00ab crit\u00e8re classique \u00bb, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que a) 18 mois constituent un retard excessif; b) le retard est inexcusable puisque la plaignante a eu amplement le temps de pr\u00e9parer et d\u00e9poser son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 compte tenu du temps d\u2019ordinateur qui lui a \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9 et n\u2019a donn\u00e9 aucune explication raisonnable pour son retard \u00e0 le faire; et c) l\u2019intim\u00e9 est susceptible de subir un pr\u00e9judice quant \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sentation des meilleurs \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve disponibles \u00e0 l\u2019audience devant le Tribunal, car le retard de plus de six ans maintenant depuis l\u2019incident qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte privera le Tribunal de la possibilit\u00e9 d\u2019entendre des t\u00e9moins dont le souvenir est encore pr\u00e9sent \u00e0 l\u2019esprit, ce qui compromet l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 de l\u2019instruction.\n[14] Selon l\u2019approche \u00e9tablie dans l\u2019affaire Seitz c. Canada, 2002 CFPI 456 (CanLII) aux paragraphe 16 \u00e0 18, l\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que a) la plaignante n\u2019a tenu [traduction] \u00ab absolument aucun compte \u00bb des d\u00e9lais du Tribunal pendant plus de 18 mois, ce qui comprend six prorogations sans explication; b) la plaignante ne semble pas avoir l\u2019intention v\u00e9ritable de clore le dossier; elle a plut\u00f4t fait durer la proc\u00e9dure ind\u00e9finiment; et c) l\u2019incidence du retard constitue un abus de l\u2019administration de la justice pour les motifs susmentionn\u00e9s.\n[15] L\u2019intim\u00e9 soutient que le pr\u00e9sent dossier est comparable \u00e0 l\u2019affaire Labelle c. Rogers Communications Inc., 2012 TCDP 4, aux paragraphes 81 \u00e0 83, dans laquelle le Tribunal a rejet\u00e9 une plainte pour cause de retard parce qu\u2019il avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la plaignante de nombreuses prorogations et qu\u2019elle n\u2019avait fourni aucune explication raisonnable pour son omission de respecter ses obligations en mati\u00e8re de divulgation et de d\u00e9p\u00f4t.\nOBSERVATIONS DE LA COMMISSION\n[16] La Commission soutient qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas dans l\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat public de rejeter l\u2019ensemble de la plainte en raison du retard de la plaignante \u00e0 d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 puisque la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans les d\u00e9lais et que la version modifi\u00e9e est d\u2019une utilit\u00e9 limit\u00e9e aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00e9tant survenus apr\u00e8s l\u2019incident du 26 mai 2017 qui a donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 la plainte, que le rejet de l\u2019ensemble de la plainte causerait un pr\u00e9judice \u00e0 la plaignante en la laissant sans recours relativement \u00e0 sa plainte et qu\u2019il est peu probable, \u00e0 ce stade, que l\u2019intim\u00e9 subisse un pr\u00e9judice en raison du retard.\n[17] La Commission soutient que le rejet de plaintes est un recours drastique qui doit \u00eatre exerc\u00e9 avec prudence, car l\u2019abus de proc\u00e9dure en raison d\u2019un d\u00e9lai administratif est une question d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale qui doit \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e dans le cadre du crit\u00e8re triple (voir Law Society of Saskatchewan c. Abrametz, 2022 CSC 29 au par. 38 et Blencoe c. Colombie-Britannique (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44 aux par. 115 et 122).\n[18] En appliquant au pr\u00e9sent dossier pour retard les deux crit\u00e8res applicables dont il est question dans Chisholm, la Commission soutient que ni l\u2019un ni l\u2019autre des crit\u00e8res n\u2019est satisfait lorsque tous les facteurs sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s, pond\u00e9r\u00e9s et \u00e9quilibr\u00e9s \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la gravit\u00e9 du recours et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de faire preuve de prudence, surtout dans un dossier o\u00f9 la plaignante n\u2019est pas repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e. Les facteurs \u00e0 pond\u00e9rer en faveur du non-rejet de la plainte sont notamment le statut de la plaignante \u00e0 titre de d\u00e9tenue incarc\u00e9r\u00e9e et non repr\u00e9sent\u00e9e soumise \u00e0 diff\u00e9rentes restrictions; le fait que la plaignante a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et que ses demandes de prorogation visaient des points suppl\u00e9mentaires concernant des \u00e9v\u00e9nements survenus apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement ayant donn\u00e9 lieu \u00e0 sa plainte; le pr\u00e9judice que subirait la plaignante si l\u2019ensemble de la plainte \u00e9tait rejet\u00e9e, ce qui la laisserait sans recours, comparativement \u00e0 l\u2019absence de preuve de pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019intim\u00e9; et le fait que l\u2019intim\u00e9 ne s\u2019est pas oppos\u00e9 aux cinq premi\u00e8res prorogations.\n[19] Au lieu de rejeter l\u2019ensemble de la plainte, la Commission sugg\u00e8re au Tribunal de fixer des dates pour que l\u2019intim\u00e9 d\u00e9pose son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions en r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 celui de la plaignante et de proc\u00e9der \u00e0 une audience au cours de laquelle la plaignante ne peut soulever aucune question qui n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 clairement indiqu\u00e9e dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions.\nIII. ANALYSE\n[20] Je conviens que le Tribunal est \u00ab ma\u00eetre de sa propre proc\u00e9dure \u00bb et qu\u2019il a le pouvoir discr\u00e9tionnaire de g\u00e9rer ses ressources comme il le juge indiqu\u00e9. Je conviens aussi que je dois faire preuve de prudence \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du rejet de la plainte pour les motifs cit\u00e9s par la Commission, et que je ne peux le faire qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir pleinement \u00e9valu\u00e9 les facteurs pertinents et pris en compte \u00e0 la fois les imp\u00e9ratifs d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 et de c\u00e9l\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[21] Ce faisant, je garde \u00e0 l\u2019esprit que le Tribunal et les parties ont \u00e9t\u00e9 extr\u00eamement r\u00e9ceptifs aux demandes de prorogation pr\u00e9sent\u00e9es par la plaignante pendant plus de 18 mois, bien que, selon moi, elle a eu amplement l\u2019occasion de d\u00e9poser l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9 dans les d\u00e9lais allou\u00e9s et que les excuses donn\u00e9es concernant le temps d\u2019ordinateur ne sont ni raisonnables ni cr\u00e9dibles. \u00c0 cet \u00e9gard, j\u2019accepte les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve non contredits que l\u2019intim\u00e9 a pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s au paragraphe 6 ci-dessus concernant l\u2019acc\u00e8s amplement suffisant \u00e0 des ordinateurs qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 offert \u00e0 la plaignante en vue de les utiliser pour pr\u00e9parer son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, mais dont elle ne s\u2019est pas pr\u00e9value.\n[22] La Commission laisse entendre que la derni\u00e8re prorogation jusqu\u2019au 14 octobre 2022 \u00e9tait raisonnable, contrairement \u00e0 la demande de la plaignante de proroger le d\u00e9lai jusqu\u2019en 2023. Malgr\u00e9 les six prorogations accord\u00e9es et les avertissements \u00e0 l\u2019effet que les deux derni\u00e8res seraient effectivement les derni\u00e8res, la plaignante n\u2019a tenu absolument aucun compte des d\u00e9lais et des r\u00e8gles du Tribunal et a fait en sorte que l\u2019affaire demeure statique pendant un d\u00e9lai d\u00e9raisonnable sans intention apparente de clore le dossier. Cela est confirm\u00e9 par le fait que, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 maintenant, la plaignante a non seulement omis de d\u00e9poser un expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions modifi\u00e9, en d\u00e9pit des six prorogations s\u2019\u00e9tendant sur plus de 18 mois, mais elle n\u2019a m\u00eame pas d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 la requ\u00eate comme elle avait promis de le faire. Nous ignorons m\u00eame si elle est d\u2019accord avec la suggestion faite par la Commission au paragraphe 19 ci-dessus.\n[23] Cela d\u00e9montre un manque de respect de la part de la plaignante \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard du Tribunal, des autres parties et de la proc\u00e9dure qui constitue un abus de l\u2019administration de la justice et de la proc\u00e9dure, ind\u00e9pendamment de tout pr\u00e9judice caus\u00e9 par le retard excessif et inexcusable.\n[24] Par cons\u00e9quent, en \u00e9valuant les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, je suis d\u2019avis que l\u2019affaire s\u2019inscrit dans le cadre de l\u2019approche Seitz et que la requ\u00eate doit \u00eatre accord\u00e9e et la plainte, rejet\u00e9e.\nIV.

Elle lui a fait savoir qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9e. Lorsqu\u2019elle a repouss\u00e9 les avances de M. Randall, il a cess\u00e9 de lui fournir des commentaires positifs, et elle a alors \u00e9t\u00e9 cong\u00e9di\u00e9e.\nLe Tribunal a conclu que les actes de M. Randall constituaient du harc\u00e8lement sexuel.\nMme Dicks a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une plainte distincte contre son employeur.

D\u00c9CISION [1] La plaignante, Rae-Lynne Dicks, pr\u00e9tend avoir subi du harc\u00e8lement sexuel de la part de l\u2019intim\u00e9, James Randall, alors qu\u2019elle travaillait pour une compagnie de remorquage (la \u00ab Compagnie \u00bb), ce qui constitue un acte discriminatoire aux termes de l\u2019article 14 de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, L.R.C. 1985, c. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb).\n[2] Pour les motifs qui suivent, je conclus que M. Randall a harcel\u00e9 sexuellement Mme Dicks, ce qui constitue un acte discriminatoire aux termes de la LCDP, et j\u2019ordonne par cons\u00e9quent des mesures de r\u00e9paration.\nII. MME DICKS EST UN T\u00c9MOIN CR\u00c9DIBLE [3] J\u2019ai entendu les d\u00e9positions de deux t\u00e9moins durant l\u2019audience, celle de Mme Dicks et celle de son psychologue traitant, M. Jeff Morley.\n[4] Mme Dicks avait au d\u00e9part d\u00e9sign\u00e9 la Compagnie comme intim\u00e9e dans le cadre de sa plainte, au m\u00eame titre que l\u2019intim\u00e9 James Randall. En octobre 2020, elle a conclu une entente de r\u00e8glement avec la Compagnie, et l\u2019instruction du pr\u00e9sent dossier s\u2019est poursuivie avec M. Randall comme seul intim\u00e9.\n[5] Ni lui ni la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne ne se sont pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019audience ni n\u2019y ont autrement particip\u00e9 bien que le Tribunal les ait avis\u00e9s de sa tenue et leur ait donn\u00e9 l\u2019occasion d\u2019agir.\n[6] Je peux rejeter l\u2019ensemble d\u2019un t\u00e9moignage ou en admettre une partie ou la totalit\u00e9, le tout notamment en fonction de la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moin.\n[7] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Faryna v. Chorny 1951 CanLII 252, la Cour d\u2019appel de la Colombie-Britannique a d\u00e9crit de la mani\u00e8re suivante la m\u00e9thode \u00e0 privil\u00e9gier pour appr\u00e9cier la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Les possibilit\u00e9s qu\u2019avait le t\u00e9moin d\u2019\u00eatre au courant des faits, sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019observation, son jugement, sa m\u00e9moire et son aptitude \u00e0 d\u00e9crire avec pr\u00e9cision ce qu\u2019il a vu et entendu contribuent, de concert avec d\u2019autres facteurs, \u00e0 cr\u00e9er ce qu\u2019on appelle la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 [...].\nLa cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 des t\u00e9moins int\u00e9ress\u00e9s ne peut \u00eatre \u00e9valu\u00e9e, surtout en cas de contradiction des d\u00e9positions, en fonction du seul crit\u00e8re consistant \u00e0 se demander si le comportement du t\u00e9moin permet de convaincre qu\u2019il dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. Le crit\u00e8re applicable consiste plut\u00f4t \u00e0 d\u00e9terminer raisonnablement si son r\u00e9cit est compatible avec les probabilit\u00e9s qui caract\u00e9risent les faits en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce. Bref, pour d\u00e9terminer si la version d\u2019un t\u00e9moin est conforme \u00e0 la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 dans un cas de cette nature, il faut d\u00e9terminer si le t\u00e9moignage est compatible avec celui qu\u2019une personne sens\u00e9e et inform\u00e9e, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, reconna\u00eetrait d\u2019embl\u00e9e comme un t\u00e9moignage raisonnable, compte tenu de la situation et des circonstances [...] En outre, il peut arriver qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin dise ce qu\u2019il croit sinc\u00e8rement \u00eatre la v\u00e9rit\u00e9, mais se trompe en toute honn\u00eatet\u00e9 (p. 356-357).\n[8] Sur la foi des facteurs \u00e9nonc\u00e9s dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Faryna, je conclus que Mme Dicks est un t\u00e9moin cr\u00e9dible. Sa d\u00e9position \u00e9tait raisonnable, cr\u00e9dible et coh\u00e9rente. En outre, elle n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 contest\u00e9e vu le d\u00e9faut de M. Randall de participer \u00e0 l\u2019audience, et rien dans le dossier de la preuve ne contredisait les dires de Mme Dicks.\n[9] Par cons\u00e9quent, j\u2019admets la totalit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dicks, et c\u2019est celui-ci que j\u2019examinerai maintenant.\nIII. LE T\u00c9MOIGNAGE DE MME DICKS [10] Mme Dicks est une femme \u00e2g\u00e9e de 55 ans qui \u00e9tait op\u00e9ratrice et r\u00e9partitrice au 911 avant de travailler pour la Compagnie \u00e0 Surrey, en Colombie-Britannique. Elle a re\u00e7u un diagnostic de trouble de stress post-traumatique (\u00ab TSPT \u00bb) suivant ses ann\u00e9es de service au 911 et est susceptible de souffrir d\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et de d\u00e9pression.\n[11] Du 20 octobre 2017 au 15 janvier 2018, soit pendant environ trois mois, elle a travaill\u00e9 pour la Compagnie, qui offrait des services de remorquage. Elle \u00e9tait commis \u00e0 la facturation. M. Randall \u00e9tait le r\u00e9partiteur en chef et elle relevait de lui lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait en poste.\n[12] Mme Dicks travaillait r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement avec M. Randall. Celui-ci lui r\u00e9p\u00e9tait souvent qu\u2019\u00e9tant donn\u00e9 son anciennet\u00e9 au sein de la Compagnie, il jouissait de la confiance et de l\u2019appui du directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, ce qui lui permettait de faire ce que bon lui semblait sans craindre d\u2019\u00eatre renvoy\u00e9. D\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme Dicks, ces d\u00e9clarations la mettaient mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise et lui causaient des inqui\u00e9tudes quant \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 de son emploi.\n[13] Le soir du 26 novembre 2017, Mme Dicks a entam\u00e9 un quart de travail de 12 heures avec M. Randall. Ils \u00e9taient seuls, sauf lorsque les conducteurs de d\u00e9panneuse entraient dans le bureau pour y d\u00e9poser des documents.\n[14] Au cours de ce quart, M. Randall s\u2019est tenu debout devant le comptoir, emp\u00eachant Mme Dicks d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux registres des v\u00e9hicules, et a attendu qu\u2019elle s\u2019approche de lui en vue d\u2019y faire des inscriptions. Il fredonnait tout en effectuant des mouvements de danse.\n[15] Mme Dicks a demand\u00e9 \u00e0 M. Randall de s\u2019\u00e9carter afin de lui permettre d\u2019acc\u00e9der aux registres. \u00c0 ce moment-l\u00e0, M. Randall a entrav\u00e9 son acc\u00e8s et a tent\u00e9 d\u2019effectuer une danse \u00ab \u00e0 coup de hanche \u00bb avec elle. Elle a tent\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9viter physiquement pour qu\u2019il cesse sa danse et lui a de nouveau demand\u00e9 de se d\u00e9placer.\n[16] M. Randall s\u2019est finalement tass\u00e9 et lui a dit, \u00e0 peu de choses pr\u00e8s : [traduction] \u00ab Hey, j\u2019ai vraiment besoin de me saouler \u00e0 m\u2019en rendre stupide, veux-tu venir te saouler chez moi apr\u00e8s le boulot? \u00bb Mme Dicks lui a r\u00e9pondu qu\u2019elle ne buvait pas, a fui son regard et a poursuivi ses inscriptions dans les registres. M. Randall a r\u00e9pondu quelque chose comme : [traduction] \u00ab C\u2019est correct, tu peux venir et t\u2019occuper de moi pendant que je me saoule. Je suis un bon vivant quand je suis ivre. \u00bb\n[17] Selon Mme Dicks, il \u00e9tait clair que M. Randall souhaitait se saouler et avoir une relation sexuelle avec elle, et ce, \u00e0 cause de son air suggestif et de la fa\u00e7on dont il bougeait les hanches, qui \u00e9tait intrins\u00e8quement sexuelle. Elle a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab Je ne veille pas sur les gens ivres \u00bb et a ensuite ignor\u00e9 M. Randall. Elle affirme qu\u2019elle souhaitait fuir, mais \u00e9tait paralys\u00e9e. Elle craignait ce qu\u2019il allait faire, puisqu\u2019ils \u00e9taient fin seuls.\n[18] \u00c0 deux reprises peu apr\u00e8s cet incident, M. Randall a tenu des propos similaires \u00e0 son \u00e9gard sans signe avant-coureur et dans un ton d\u00e9crit comme lascif par Mme Dicks. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 : [traduction] \u00ab tu sais ce que je veux \u00bb en effectuant un mouvement circulaire des hanches pendant qu\u2019il passait pr\u00e8s de Mme Dicks. Mme Dicks affirme s\u2019\u00eatre sentie craintive, anxieuse et prise pour cible.\n[19] \u00c0 deux douzaines de reprises par la suite, M. Randall s\u2019est fait un devoir de lui toucher l\u2019\u00e9paule, le cou ou le haut de la poitrine sans qu\u2019elle y consente et en invoquant des pr\u00e9textes comme celui d\u2019enlever un cheveu \u00e9gar\u00e9. Il \u00e9clatait souvent de rire lorsqu\u2019elle se repliait sur elle-m\u00eame ou s\u2019\u00e9loignait vivement de lui.\n[20] Mme Dicks a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que ces gestes r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s lui laissaient comprendre que M. Randall n\u2019avait pas d\u2019\u00e9gard pour son espace personnel et qu\u2019il pouvait la toucher \u00e0 son gr\u00e9, sans son consentement et malgr\u00e9 le fait qu\u2019elle manifestait activement son refus de l\u2019attouchement. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, elle se sentait [traduction] \u00ab petite, insignifiante et sans d\u00e9fense \u00bb.\n[21] Entre la mi-novembre et la mi-d\u00e9cembre 2017 environ, M. Randall appuyait sa poitrine sur l\u2019\u00e9paule de Mme Dicks et pla\u00e7ait sa main sur la sienne pour bouger la souris lorsqu\u2019elle le questionnait au regard de la facturation ou du syst\u00e8me informatique. Selon Mme Dicks, cet incident particulier est survenu une douzaine de fois et l\u2019a laiss\u00e9e tr\u00e8s mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise.\n[22] La premi\u00e8re fois, son sup\u00e9rieur a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab bien comme \u00e7a \u00bb. Chaque fois, il lui disait de se [traduction] \u00ab d\u00e9tendre \u00bb, qu\u2019il n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en train de l\u2019attaquer, ou qu\u2019ils \u00e9taient [traduction] \u00ab tous des adultes \u00bb, et qu\u2019ils devraient \u00eatre en mesure de [traduction] \u00ab parler de sexe et de leur ex \u00bb.\n[23] Mme Dicks a estim\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 environ six reprises entre octobre et d\u00e9cembre 2017, des conducteurs de d\u00e9panneuse lui ont demand\u00e9 si elle \u00e9tait [traduction] \u00ab en qu\u00eate d\u2019un bon gars \u00bb. Selon elle, M. Randall demandait aux conducteurs de lui poser cette question parce qu\u2019ils ne le faisaient que lorsqu\u2019elle \u00e9tait seule avec lui durant un quart et que celui-ci se tenait \u00e0 proximit\u00e9 d\u2019eux et pouvait entendre la conversation. La derni\u00e8re fois que quelqu\u2019un lui a pos\u00e9 la question, \u00e0 la fin du mois de d\u00e9cembre, Mme Dicks a clairement r\u00e9torqu\u00e9, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 se faire entendre de son sup\u00e9rieur, qu\u2019elle ne sortait pas avec ses coll\u00e8gues et qu\u2019elle [traduction] \u00ab n\u2019\u00e9tait pas en qu\u00eate d\u2019un homme, donc [qu\u2019ils pouvaient arr\u00eater de lui] poser la question \u00bb.\n[24] Elle affirme qu\u2019apr\u00e8s cet \u00e9v\u00e9nement, les [traduction] \u00ab tactiques [de M. Randall] ont chang\u00e9 \u00bb et que chaque fois qu\u2019elle avait des conversations personnelles avec un conducteur en sa pr\u00e9sence par la suite, il intervenait et tenait des propos comme [traduction] \u00ab Rae-Lynne ne sort pas avec ses coll\u00e8gues, tu sais \u00bb. D\u00e8s lors, il a cess\u00e9 de faire des commentaires positifs sur le travail de Mme Dicks.\n[25] Mme Dicks a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans son t\u00e9moignage : [traduction] \u00ab ce comportement m\u2019a vraiment mise sur la d\u00e9fensive, comme si je n\u2019avais aucune valeur \u00e0 titre de coll\u00e8gue parce que j\u2019avais refus\u00e9 de sortir avec lui ou d\u2019avoir un rapport sexuel avec lui apr\u00e8s le travail. Mes comp\u00e9tences professionnelles n\u2019\u00e9taient plus pertinentes. Je n\u2019avais pas d\u2019esprit d\u2019\u00e9quipe [...] seulement parce que je refusais de sortir avec lui \u00bb.\n[26] \u00c0 la mi-janvier 2018, elle parlait \u00e0 un conducteur qui, tout comme deux de ses coll\u00e8gues, lui avait propos\u00e9 de l\u2019aider \u00e0 d\u00e9m\u00e9nager des meubles parce qu\u2019elle quittait son appartement \u00e0 la fin du mois. M. Randall a entendu cette conversation et a tent\u00e9 de s\u2019inviter. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9, \u00e0 peu de choses pr\u00e8s : [traduction] \u00ab Hey, \u00e7a semble amusant. J\u2019aimerais aider. J\u2019habite \u00e0 trois rues de l\u00e0. Je peux venir avec ma caisse de six bi\u00e8res. Je veux dire, je ne peux pas aider avec le transport des objets, mais je peux vous divertir. \u00bb\n[27] Mme Dicks a fermement rejet\u00e9 l\u2019offre, mais dit que M. Randall cherchait sans cesse \u00e0 se faire inviter. D\u2019apr\u00e8s elle, elle est rest\u00e9e craintive apr\u00e8s cet incident, car si M. Randall avait dit qu\u2019il vivait \u00e0 trois rues de chez elle, cela signifiait qu\u2019il savait o\u00f9 elle demeurait. Elle ne sait pas comment M. Randall a su o\u00f9 elle vivait et elle ne voulait pas qu\u2019il se pr\u00e9sente chez elle sans crier gare le jour du d\u00e9m\u00e9nagement ni \u00e0 tout autre moment.\n[28] Aux dires de Mme Dicks, entre le 2 et le 14 janvier 2018, apr\u00e8s qu\u2019elle eut repouss\u00e9 \u00e0 plusieurs reprises les avances de M. Randall devant des tiers, celui-ci a inform\u00e9 le directeur de la Compagnie qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas capable d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter avec comp\u00e9tence ses t\u00e2ches, et ce, m\u00eame si elle avait auparavant re\u00e7u des \u00e9valuations favorables pour son travail. Par cons\u00e9quent, M. Randall a obtenu l\u2019autorisation de consacrer une heure de plus chaque quart \u00e0 la v\u00e9rification du travail de Mme Dicks, qu\u2019il harcelait et interrompait, ce qui rendait difficile pour elle l\u2019ex\u00e9cution de ses t\u00e2ches.\n[29] Le 14 janvier 2018 (l\u2019avant-dernier jour de travail de Mme Dicks \u00e0 la Compagnie), M. Randall l\u2019a approch\u00e9e et lui a parl\u00e9 de ses relations avec les femmes. Il lui a alors demand\u00e9 si elle avait d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu [traduction] \u00ab une aventure d\u2019une nuit \u00bb. Elle dit qu\u2019elle voulait mettre un terme \u00e0 la conversation et a r\u00e9pondu quelque chose comme : [traduction] \u00ab je suis une femme adulte et mes aventures ne regardent que moi \u00bb. M. Randall a r\u00e9torqu\u00e9 quelque chose dans la veine de : [traduction] \u00ab cela veut donc dire oui [...] parle-moi-en [\u2026] o\u00f9 l\u2019as-tu trouv\u00e9 [\u2026] \u00e9tait-il bon au lit? \u00bb.\n[30] Mme Dicks d\u00e9clare s\u2019\u00eatre sentie mal \u00e0 l\u2019aise durant cette interaction. Elle a \u00e9t\u00e9 soulag\u00e9e lorsqu\u2019un conducteur est entr\u00e9 dans le bureau et qu\u2019elle a pu clore cet \u00e9change avec M. Randall.\n[31] Le 15 janvier 2018, la Compagnie a mis fin \u00e0 son emploi. Durant son t\u00e9moignage, elle a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle ne pouvait pas parler des circonstances de sa cessation d\u2019emploi en raison des clauses de confidentialit\u00e9 stipul\u00e9es dans l\u2019entente de r\u00e8glement conclue avec la Compagnie.\n[32] Quant aux r\u00e9percussions d\u00e9coulant du harc\u00e8lement subi de la part de M. Randall, Mme Dicks dit que, compte tenu du TPST chronique qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 apr\u00e8s ses ann\u00e9es de service \u00e0 titre d\u2019op\u00e9ratrice et de r\u00e9partitrice du 911, elle \u00e9tait dans une position particuli\u00e8rement vuln\u00e9rable et que la conduite de M. Randall a eu des cons\u00e9quences d\u00e9vastatrices sur elle.\n[33] Elle d\u00e9clare ce qui suit relativement au fait de travailler aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de M. Randall :\n[traduction] Cela me rendait nerveuse, augmentait mon anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et me faisait douter de mes comp\u00e9tences professionnelles. Ces \u00e9v\u00e9nements ont \u00e9branl\u00e9 ma confiance, m\u2019ont laiss\u00e9e sans sommeil et m\u2019ont emp\u00each\u00e9e de travailler au mieux de mes capacit\u00e9s. D\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, \u00e0 titre de femme c\u00e9libataire, j\u2019\u00e9tais une proie facile, et si je r\u00e9sistais, je subirais les cons\u00e9quences. Au cours de mon emploi, j\u2019ai eu de la difficult\u00e9 \u00e0 m\u2019adapter, \u00e0 dormir, \u00e0 prendre soin de moi et \u00e0 conserver mon \u00e9quilibre professionnel au travail. J\u2019ai commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 prendre souvent rendez-vous avec mon docteur et \u00e0 avoir besoin de somnif\u00e8res chaque nuit.\n[34] Concernant la p\u00e9riode suivant son d\u00e9part de la Compagnie, Mme Dicks dit ce qui suit :\n[traduction] Je me suis effondr\u00e9e et j\u2019ai souffert d\u2019un \u00e9pisode d\u00e9pressif majeur comme je n\u2019en avais pas v\u00e9cu depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es. La d\u00e9pression, l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9, la col\u00e8re, la culpabilit\u00e9 et un grave manque de confiance en moi m\u2019ont rendue incapable de me soigner de la fa\u00e7on la plus \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire qui soit. M\u00eame si je savais que ce n\u2019\u00e9tait pas de ma faute, j\u2019ai recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 me punir en ne prenant pas soin de moi. J\u2019avais cette habitude depuis plusieurs ann\u00e9es et je me d\u00e9testais pour cela. Pour le reste du mois de janvier, et l\u2019ensemble de f\u00e9vrier et de mars, je n\u2019\u00e9tais pas fonctionnelle. Je ne mangeais pas convenablement, je ne dormais pas sans prendre de somnif\u00e8res et je souffrais d\u2019insomnie. J\u2019allais si mal que mon docteur s\u2019en est montr\u00e9 pr\u00e9occup\u00e9 et qu\u2019il m\u2019a convaincue de recommencer \u00e0 prendre des antid\u00e9presseurs.\n[35] Mme Dicks affirme avoir d\u00e9m\u00e9nag\u00e9 \u00e0 Grand Forks, en Colombie-Britannique, en avril 2019 pour \u00eatre plus proche de sa famille, notamment \u00e0 cause de sa mauvaise exp\u00e9rience aupr\u00e8s de M. Randall.\n[36] Mme Dicks a cit\u00e9 \u00e0 compara\u00eetre son psychologue traitant, M. Jeff Morley, pour qu\u2019il t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 titre de t\u00e9moin expert. M. Morley a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il est titulaire d\u2019un doctorat en psychologie de l\u2019orientation de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique et qu\u2019il est membre de l\u2019Ordre des psychologues de la Colombie-Britannique depuis 2004. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il est titulaire d\u2019un permis d\u2019exercice de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie am\u00e9ricaine d\u2019experts en stress traumatique et qu\u2019il est donc un expert dans ce domaine. Compte tenu de ses titres de comp\u00e9tence, j\u2019admets que M. Morley est un t\u00e9moin expert dans le domaine de la psychologie.\n[37] M. Morley a livr\u00e9 un bref t\u00e9moignage. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019il avait proc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 une \u00e9valuation psychologique de Mme Dicks en f\u00e9vrier 2013 et qu\u2019il avait pos\u00e9 un diagnostic de TSPT chronique et de trouble d\u00e9pressif majeur. Il a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que Mme Dicks l\u2019avait [traduction] \u00ab consult\u00e9 de temps en temps au fil des ann\u00e9es \u00bb et que les sympt\u00f4mes de ses troubles, y compris l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et la d\u00e9pression, sont toujours pr\u00e9sents. Hormis sa confirmation du diagnostic de 2013 et sa d\u00e9claration portant que les sympt\u00f4mes persistent, M. Morley n\u2019a rien dit d\u2019autre de notable.\nIV. HARC\u00c8LEMENT SEXUEL \u2014 CRIT\u00c8RE JURIDIQUE [38] Le fait de harceler un individu dans le cours de son emploi constitue un acte discriminatoire, s\u2019il est fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite, et le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est r\u00e9put\u00e9 \u00eatre un harc\u00e8lement fond\u00e9 sur un motif de distinction illicite : LCDP, art. 14.\n[39] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen c. Platy Enterprises Ltd., [1989] 1 R.C.S. 1252, \u00e0 la page 1284, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9crit le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en ces termes :\nSans chercher \u00e0 fournir une d\u00e9finition exhaustive de cette expression, j\u2019estime que le harc\u00e8lement sexuel en milieu de travail peut se d\u00e9finir de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale comme \u00e9tant une conduite de nature sexuelle non sollicit\u00e9e qui a un effet d\u00e9favorable sur le milieu de travail ou qui a des cons\u00e9quences pr\u00e9judiciables en mati\u00e8re d\u2019emploi pour les victimes du harc\u00e8lement. [\u2026] Le harc\u00e8lement sexuel est une pratique d\u00e9gradante, qui inflige un grave affront \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 des employ\u00e9s forc\u00e9s de le subir. En imposant \u00e0 un employ\u00e9 de faire face \u00e0 des gestes sexuels importuns ou \u00e0 des demandes sexuelles explicites, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel sur le lieu de travail est une atteinte \u00e0 la dignit\u00e9 de la victime et \u00e0 son respect de soi, \u00e0 la fois comme employ\u00e9 et comme \u00eatre humain.\n[40] Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Commission des droits de la personne) c. Canada (Forces arm\u00e9es), [1999] 3 CF 653, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a \u00e9largi le raisonnement expos\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Janzen. La Cour a conclu que, pour qu\u2019une all\u00e9gation de harc\u00e8lement sexuel soit fond\u00e9e, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui suivent doivent \u00eatre \u00e9tablis :\n(1) Les actes qui constituent le fondement de la plainte doivent \u00eatre importuns, ou devraient \u00eatre jug\u00e9s importuns par une personne raisonnable;\n(2) La conduite doit \u00eatre de nature sexuelle;\n(3) Normalement, le harc\u00e8lement sexuel exige un degr\u00e9 de persistance ou de r\u00e9p\u00e9tition, mais, dans certaines circonstances, un seul incident peut \u00eatre suffisamment grave pour cr\u00e9er un milieu de travail hostile.\nV. LA CONDUITE DE M. RANDALL CONSTITUE DU HARC\u00c8LEMENT SEXUEL\n[41] Je suis convaincu que Mme Dicks a prouv\u00e9, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, les volets essentiels du crit\u00e8re relatif au harc\u00e8lement sexuel \u00e9nonc\u00e9 par la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale.\n[42] Je conclus que le comportement de M. Randall \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Dicks entre octobre 2017 et janvier 2018, notamment en ce qui concerne les attouchements non d\u00e9sir\u00e9s, les remarques suggestives, les mouvements circulaires des hanches, les questions quant \u00e0 ses ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents sexuels et les invitations \u00e0 sortir avec lui, \u00e0 se saouler avec lui ou \u00e0 se rendre chez lui, constituait une conduite qui \u00e9tait manifestement de nature sexuelle.\n[43] Je conclus que la conduite de M. Randall \u00e9tait importune ou qu\u2019il \u00e9tait raisonnable de s\u2019attendre que M. Randall sache que sa conduite \u00e9tait importune. Mme Dicks a clairement et constamment inform\u00e9 M. Randall qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas int\u00e9ress\u00e9e \u00e0 avoir de conversation, d\u2019interaction physique ou de relation avec lui qui soit de nature sexuelle.\n[44] Je conclus \u00e9galement que M. Randall a eu une conduite de nature sexuelle inappropri\u00e9e et persistante durant plusieurs mois et que celle-ci a eu des effets nuisibles sur l\u2019environnement de travail de Mme Dicks. Je souscris \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de celle-ci voulant que la conduite de M. Randall l\u2019ait rendue anxieuse et craintive, et ait eu des r\u00e9percussions d\u00e9favorables sur sa confiance et sur sa capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 ex\u00e9cuter ses t\u00e2ches.\n[45] Par cons\u00e9quent, compte tenu du t\u00e9moignage de Mme Dicks, que j\u2019ai admis en totalit\u00e9, et du crit\u00e8re juridique que je dois appliquer, je conclus que la conduite de M. Randall constitue du harc\u00e8lement sexuel et un acte discriminatoire aux termes de l\u2019article 14 de la LCDP.\n[46] Apr\u00e8s avoir conclu \u00e0 l\u2019existence d\u2019une violation de la LCDP, je me penche maintenant sur la question des mesures de r\u00e9paration.\nVI. MESURES DE R\u00c9PARATION\nPr\u00e9judice moral\n[47] Mme Dicks r\u00e9clame 10 000 $ en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Randall pour le pr\u00e9judice moral subi.\n[48] Le Tribunal peut indemniser jusqu\u2019\u00e0 concurrence de 20 000 $ la victime qui a souffert un pr\u00e9judice moral du fait d\u2019un acte discriminatoire : LCDP, al. 53(2)e). Cependant, le Tribunal r\u00e9serve g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement le montant maximal de 20 000 $ aux cas les plus flagrants, caract\u00e9ris\u00e9s par l\u2019ampleur et la dur\u00e9e des actes discriminatoires : Grant c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2012 TCDP 10, au par. 115; Alizadeh-Ebadi c. Manitoba Telecom Services Inc., 2017 TCDP 36, au par. 213.\n[49] Afin d\u2019\u00e9tablir le juste montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats pour pr\u00e9judice moral, le Tribunal doit \u00e9valuer les cons\u00e9quences de l\u2019acte discriminatoire pour les victimes, entre autres \u00ab les cons\u00e9quences \u00e9motionnelles, la frustration, la d\u00e9ception, la perte d\u2019estime et de confiance en soi, le chagrin, le bien[-]\u00eatre affectif, le stress, l\u2019anxi\u00e9t\u00e9 et parfois m\u00eame la d\u00e9pression, les id\u00e9es suicidaires et autres manifestations de nature psychologique r\u00e9sultant de l\u2019acte discriminatoire \u00bb : Youmbi Eken c. R\u00e9seaux Netrium Inc., 2019 TCDP 44, au par. 71.\n[50] Bien que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve m\u00e9dicaux soient utiles pour \u00e9valuer les dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats, ils ne sont pas absolument n\u00e9cessaires : McFee c. Chemin de fer Canadien Pacifique,, 2019 TCDP 28, au par. 135.\n[51] En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, le harc\u00e8lement subi par Mme Dicks aux mains de M. Randall a eu lieu sur une br\u00e8ve p\u00e9riode (moins de trois mois). Toutefois, la victime s\u2019en est trouv\u00e9e marqu\u00e9e, surtout compte tenu de sa vuln\u00e9rabilit\u00e9 en lien avec son TPST chronique d\u00e9j\u00e0 pr\u00e9sent. Comme je l\u2019ai soulign\u00e9 plus haut, je souscris \u00e0 la d\u00e9claration de Mme Dicks portant que la conduite de M. Randall la rendait anxieuse et craintive au travail, ce qui nuisait \u00e0 sa confiance et \u00e0 sa capacit\u00e9 d\u2019ex\u00e9cuter les t\u00e2ches inh\u00e9rentes \u00e0 son emploi. Elle affirme, et je reconnais, qu\u2019apr\u00e8s avoir quitt\u00e9 la Compagnie, elle a continu\u00e9 de subir un pr\u00e9judice psychologique par suite de la conduite de M. Randall, dont un trouble d\u00e9pressif majeur, qui a dur\u00e9 plusieurs mois.\n[52] Apr\u00e8s avoir tenu compte de la dur\u00e9e et des r\u00e9percussions du harc\u00e8lement ainsi que de l\u2019\u00e9ventail des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats adjug\u00e9s par le Tribunal au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral dans d\u2019autres affaires de harc\u00e8lement sexuel, y compris NA c. 1416992 Ontario Ltd., 2018 TCDP 33 (10 000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du particulier intim\u00e9), Opheim c. Gagan Gill et Gillco Inc., 2016 TCDP 12 (7 500 $), Green c. Thomas 2016 TCDP 13 (5 000 $), et Cassidy c. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 canadienne des postes et Raj Thambirajah, 2012 TCDP 29 (5 000 $ \u00e0 l\u2019encontre du particulier intim\u00e9), j\u2019accorde la somme de 9 000 $ \u00e0 Mme Dicks au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral.\nConduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e\n[53] Mme Dicks r\u00e9clame 5 000 $ en dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Randall pour sa conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e.\n[54] Le Tribunal peut ordonner \u00e0 l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte discriminatoire de payer \u00e0 la victime une indemnit\u00e9 maximale de 20 000 $, s\u2019il en vient \u00e0 la conclusion que l\u2019acte a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9 ou inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 : LCDP, par. 53(3).\n[55] Afin de fixer le montant appropri\u00e9 en vertu de cette disposition, le Tribunal se penche sur le comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et non sur l\u2019effet qu\u2019a eu son comportement sur le plaignant : Beattie et Bangloy c. Affaires autochtones et du Nord Canada, 2019 TCDP 45, au par. 210, conf. par 2021 CF 60.\n[56] Dans la d\u00e9cision Canada (Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral) c. Johnstone, 2013 CF 113, confirm\u00e9e par l\u2019arr\u00eat 2014 CAF 110, la Cour f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit au regard du paragraphe 53(3) :\nIl s\u2019agit d\u2019une disposition punitive visant \u00e0 dissuader ou \u00e0 d\u00e9courager ceux qui se livrent de fa\u00e7on d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 des actes discriminatoires. [\u2026] On entend par \u00ab acte inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00bb celui qui t\u00e9moigne d\u2019un m\u00e9pris ou d\u2019une indiff\u00e9rence quant aux cons\u00e9quences et d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u2019agir t\u00e9m\u00e9raire ou insouciante.\n[57] Si le Tribunal conclut que l\u2019intim\u00e9 \u00ab a agi sans se soucier des cons\u00e9quences \u00bb de ses actes, il peut accorder des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats en vertu de ce paragraphe : Warman c. Winnicki, 2006 TCDP 20, au par. 174. Le montant des dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats devrait \u00eatre proportionnel au caract\u00e8re r\u00e9pr\u00e9hensible du comportement de l\u2019intim\u00e9 et l\u2019adjudication de la somme de 20 000 $ devrait \u00eatre r\u00e9serv\u00e9e aux cas les plus flagrants : Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 l\u2019enfance et \u00e0 la famille des Premi\u00e8res Nations du Canada et autres c. Procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du Canada (repr\u00e9sentant le ministre des Affaires autochtones et du Nord canadien) 2019 TCDP 39, au par. 230.\n[58] Je conclus qu\u2019en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, M. Randall a agi d\u2019une mani\u00e8re d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de Mme Dicks. Au cours de l\u2019emploi de cette derni\u00e8re, M. Randall, de qui elle relevait lorsqu\u2019il \u00e9tait en poste, \u00e9tait son sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9partiteur en chef. Il a tir\u00e9 profit de ce rapport de pouvoir en adoptant un comportement sexualis\u00e9 alors qu\u2019il savait ou aurait d\u00fb savoir que celui-ci n\u2019\u00e9tait pas sollicit\u00e9 par Mme Dicks. Lorsqu\u2019elle a repouss\u00e9 ses avances, il a exerc\u00e9 des mesures de repr\u00e9sailles en pr\u00e9sentant des commentaires d\u00e9favorables sur son travail.\n[59] Dans ces circonstances, je conclus que Mme Dicks a droit \u00e0 la totalit\u00e9 de la somme de 5 000 $ qu\u2019elle r\u00e9clame en vertu du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP.\nPerte de salaire\n[60] Le Tribunal peut indemniser la victime de la perte de salaire entra\u00een\u00e9e par l\u2019acte discriminatoire : LCDP, al. 53(2)c).\n[61] Dans le pr\u00e9sent dossier, Mme Dicks a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019elle avait conclu une entente de r\u00e8glement confidentielle avec la Compagnie au regard de sa r\u00e9clamation pour perte de salaire et qu\u2019elle ne r\u00e9clamait donc pas de dommages-int\u00e9r\u00eats \u00e0 cet \u00e9gard \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de M. Randall.\n[62] Dans ces circonstances, je n\u2019accorde aucune indemnit\u00e9 pour la perte de salaire.\nInt\u00e9r\u00eats\n[63] Le Tribunal peut accorder des int\u00e9r\u00eats sur l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 : LCDP, par. 53(4).\n[64] Tous les int\u00e9r\u00eats accord\u00e9s doivent \u00eatre calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple sur une base annuelle en se fondant sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada (donn\u00e9es de fr\u00e9quence mensuelle). Ils courent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement de la date o\u00f9 l\u2019acte discriminatoire a \u00e9t\u00e9 commis jusqu\u2019\u00e0 la date du versement de l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 : R\u00e8gles de pratique du Tribunal canadien des droits de la personne (2021), DORS\/2021-137, art. 46.\n[65] Dans la pr\u00e9sente affaire, Mme Dicks a droit aux int\u00e9r\u00eats calcul\u00e9s \u00e0 taux simple fond\u00e9s sur le taux officiel d\u2019escompte moyen fix\u00e9 par la Banque du Canada. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats courent du 26 novembre 2017, date \u00e0 laquelle Mme Dicks affirme avoir commenc\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00eatre harcel\u00e9e sexuellement par M. Randall, jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ce que ce dernier verse l\u2019indemnit\u00e9 ordonn\u00e9e.\nVII. ORDONNANCE\n[66] Le Tribunal ordonne \u00e0 M. Randall de verser \u00e0 Mme Dicks la somme de 9 000 $ au titre du pr\u00e9judice moral et de 5 000 $ au titre de sa conduite d\u00e9lib\u00e9r\u00e9e et inconsid\u00e9r\u00e9e par application respective de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 53(2)e) et du paragraphe 53(3) de la LCDP. Les int\u00e9r\u00eats sont payables sur ces sommes aux conditions fix\u00e9es plus haut.\nSign\u00e9 par\nPaul Singh\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 2 mars 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal :\nT2485\/4220\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Rae-Lynne Dicks c.

Introduction\n[1] Les plaignants sont membres de la Premi\u00e8re Nation de Lake Babine. Ils soutiennent que l\u2019intim\u00e9e, la GRC, a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard d\u2019autres personnes en omettant de mener une enqu\u00eate approfondie sur leurs all\u00e9gations, selon lesquelles ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 victimes d\u2019abus alors qu\u2019ils fr\u00e9quentaient des \u00e9coles dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique dans les ann\u00e9es 1960 et 1970. La GRC nie que son enqu\u00eate, qui a d\u00e9but\u00e9 en 2012, \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[2] \u00c0 l\u2019appui de leur plainte, les plaignants cherchent \u00e0 faire admettre un rapport d\u2019expert r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par M. David Milward, un professeur de droit (le \u00ab rapport \u00bb). Le rapport est dat\u00e9 du 29 octobre 2021 et a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9par\u00e9 \u00e0 la demande des plaignants. Dans son rapport, M. Milward tire des conclusions sur la m\u00e9fiance, pass\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sente, des peuples autochtones au Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC. Il \u00e9voque certains renseignements dont disposait la GRC au moment o\u00f9 elle a entam\u00e9 l\u2019enqu\u00eate et laisse entendre que celle-ci \u00e9tait \u2014 ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre \u2014 au courant de cette m\u00e9fiance. Il examine le r\u00f4le qui incombait \u00e0 la GRC en ce qui concerne les pensionnats et les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, ainsi que la m\u00e9moire collective autochtone, en particulier dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[3] La GRC s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du rapport. Elle sollicite une ordonnance en vertu de l\u2019alin\u00e9a 50(3)e) de la Loi canadienne sur les droits de la personne, LRC 1985, ch. H-6 (la \u00ab LCDP \u00bb), afin d\u2019exclure le rapport de M. Milward et tout t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il pourrait livrer \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte. La GRC conteste la pertinence et la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 du rapport et affirme que M. Milward n\u2019est pas un expert d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9 puisqu\u2019il n\u2019apporte pas une aide juste, objective et impartiale au Tribunal. La GRC soutient que [traduction] \u00ab le pr\u00e9judice manifeste du rapport l\u2019emporte sur les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices qu\u2019il pourrait pr\u00e9senter \u00bb et que le Tribunal devrait exercer sa fonction de gardien pour exclure la preuve de M. Milward.\n[4] Les plaignants ne sont pas d\u2019accord avec la position de la GRC. Ils affirment que la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e dans le rapport de M. Milward est pertinente, qu\u2019elle est utile au Tribunal et donc n\u00e9cessaire, et que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices que pr\u00e9sente l\u2019admission du rapport l\u2019emportent sur toute apparence de pr\u00e9judice pour la GRC. Ils soutiennent \u00e9galement que M. Milward a toutes les qualifications requises pour fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve concernant la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les Autochtones au Canada. Ils font valoir que le fait que M. Milward ait reconnu les obligations qui lui incombent \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert \u00e9tablit qu\u2019il s\u2019est engag\u00e9 \u00e0 fournir une preuve juste, objective et impartiale.\n[5] La Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (la \u00ab Commission \u00bb), bien qu\u2019elle participe pleinement \u00e0 l\u2019instruction de la plainte, ne se prononce pas sur la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate.\nII. D\u00e9cision\n[6] La requ\u00eate de la GRC est rejet\u00e9e. Le rapport de M. Milward peut \u00eatre admis en preuve durant l\u2019audition de la plainte et M. Milward peut t\u00e9moigner relativement \u00e0 son rapport en tant qu\u2019expert.\nIII. Cadre juridique\n[7] La GRC a utilement r\u00e9sum\u00e9 les principes juridiques que le Tribunal applique souvent pour d\u00e9terminer si une preuve d\u2019expert est admissible. Les plaignants conviennent que ces principes s\u2019appliquent en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce.\n[8] La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a \u00e9tabli un cadre l\u00e9gal r\u00e9gissant l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019opinion qui \u00ab permet de parer aux dangers du t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert \u00bb, qui fait en sorte qu\u2019une audience ne se \u00ab transforme pas en un \u201cproc\u00e8s instruit par des experts\u201d et que le juge des faits demeure capable de faire un examen critique de la preuve \u00bb (R. c. Bingley, 2017 CSC 12 (CanLII) [Bingley], au paragraphe 13). La Cour supr\u00eame avait d\u2019abord \u00e9labor\u00e9 ce cadre dans l\u2019arr\u00eat R. c. Mohan, 1994 CanLII 80 (CSC), [1994] 2 RCS 9 [Mohan], et avait ensuite apport\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess Langille Inman c. Abbott and Haliburton Co., 2015 CSC 23 (CanLII) [White Burgess]. Le cadre d\u2019analyse se divise en deux \u00e9tapes, mais la Cour a indiqu\u00e9 dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Bingley qu\u2019avant d\u2019appliquer ce cadre, le juge des faits \u00ab doit d\u00e9terminer la nature et la port\u00e9e de l\u2019opinion d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e \u00bb (au paragraphe 17).\n[9] Une fois la nature et la port\u00e9e de la preuve propos\u00e9e \u00e9tablies, le Tribunal doit, \u00e0 la premi\u00e8re \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, d\u00e9terminer si la preuve d\u2019expert satisfait aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, \u00e0 savoir la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, l\u2019absence de toute r\u00e8gle d\u2019exclusion et la qualification suffisante de l\u2019expert (Mohan, aux pages 20-25; voir aussi White Burgess, au paragraphe 19). En l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, trois des crit\u00e8res de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan sont contest\u00e9s par la GRC. Par cons\u00e9quent, les plaignants doivent prouver que la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e est pertinente, qu\u2019elle est n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal et que M. Milward est un expert d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9. Si l\u2019un ou l\u2019autre de ces crit\u00e8res n\u2019est pas respect\u00e9, la preuve est inadmissible et il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de passer \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse.\n[10] \u00c0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse, le juge agit en tant que \u00ab gardien \u00bb du processus judiciaire et soup\u00e8se les risques et les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels que pr\u00e9sente l\u2019admission de la preuve (White Burgess, au paragraphe 24).\nIV. Questions en litige\n[11] La principale question \u00e0 trancher relativement \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate est celle de savoir s\u2019il faut exclure le rapport de M. Milward et tout t\u00e9moignage qu\u2019il pourrait livrer dans le cadre de l\u2019instruction. Avant de d\u00e9cider s\u2019il convient d\u2019admettre ou d\u2019exclure la preuve propos\u00e9e, le Tribunal doit :\nd\u00e9terminer la nature et la port\u00e9e de la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e; statuer sur les facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan qui sont contest\u00e9s en r\u00e9pondant aux questions suivantes :\nLe rapport est-il pertinent par rapport \u00e0 un fait en cause dans la plainte? Le rapport est-il n\u00e9cessaire du fait que les plaignants ne peuvent pas fournir la preuve et que le Tribunal a besoin de l\u2019avis d\u2019un expert pour \u00e9valuer la preuve de mani\u00e8re appropri\u00e9e? M. Milward est-il un expert d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9 pour fournir une opinion impartiale et ind\u00e9pendante?\nd\u00e9terminer, dans la mesure o\u00f9 les crit\u00e8res de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan sont respect\u00e9s, si les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels de l\u2019admission de la preuve de M. Milward l\u2019emportent sur les risques.\nV. Analyse\n[12] Le Tribunal a le pouvoir d\u2019examiner si la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e doit \u00eatre exclue et de d\u00e9terminer son admissibilit\u00e9 avant l\u2019audience [Christoforou c. John Grant Haulage Ltd., 2016 TCDP 14 (CanLII), au paragraphe 63; voir aussi les alin\u00e9as 48.9(2)g) et 50(3)e) de la LCDP]. Dans les circonstances de l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 a fourni un rapport long et exhaustif, son curriculum vitae ainsi que le formulaire d\u2019attestation de l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert, il convient de d\u00e9terminer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de la preuve propos\u00e9e \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape pr\u00e9alable \u00e0 l\u2019audience afin d\u2019\u00e9viter tout retard pendant l\u2019audience.\nA. La nature et la port\u00e9e de la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e\n[13] La GRC s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que le rapport de M. Milward soit admis en preuve dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 et \u00e0 ce que ce dernier t\u00e9moigne \u00e0 l\u2019audience. J\u2019aborde ces objections dans les sections suivantes et j\u2019explique les raisons pour lesquelles j\u2019estime que sa preuve est admissible.\n[14] Les plaignants soutiennent que l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la GRC sur les all\u00e9gations de s\u00e9vices inflig\u00e9s \u00e0 des enfants dans des \u00e9coles du nord de la Colombie-Britannique dans les ann\u00e9es 1960 et 1970 \u00e9tait discriminatoire parce qu\u2019elle ne reconnaissait pas les exp\u00e9riences particuli\u00e8res qu\u2019ils avaient v\u00e9cues en tant qu\u2019Autochtones et ne s\u2019y adaptait pas non plus. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils affirment que la GRC a manqu\u00e9 \u00e0 son obligation de modifier ses pratiques d\u2019enqu\u00eate traditionnelles pour r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 leurs besoins culturels, [traduction] \u00ab obligation qui d\u00e9coule de la m\u00e9fiance connue des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC \u00bb.\n[15] Les plaignants ont l\u2019intention de produire le rapport et de faire t\u00e9moigner M. Milward en tant qu\u2019expert sur la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones au Canada. Plus pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment, ils affirment que la preuve de M. Milward permettra de prouver que les peuples autochtones, notamment dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique, se m\u00e9fient de la GRC et que cette derni\u00e8re aurait d\u00fb en \u00eatre consciente au moment o\u00f9 elle a men\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate. En outre, les plaignants soutiennent que le rapport de M. Milward expose le contexte dans lequel ont eu lieu les interactions entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones jusqu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate en question.\n[16] Les plaignants soutiennent \u00e9galement que la preuve de M. Milward est essentielle \u00e0 leur all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, car il est important que le Tribunal sache comment la GRC s\u2019est conduite au fil du temps. Ils pr\u00e9tendent que cette preuve d\u00e9montre que la GRC a longtemps eu recours \u00e0 des pratiques qui refl\u00e9taient une culture de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Autochtones.\n[17] La plainte dont est saisi le Tribunal ne porte pas sur la question de savoir si, par le pass\u00e9, la GRC a fait preuve de discrimination \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Autochtones en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral. Elle porte plut\u00f4t sur l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la GRC sur les all\u00e9gations de mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s aux enfants autochtones dans des \u00e9coles du nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[18] Je reconnais toutefois que les plaignants et la Commission cherchent \u00e0 obtenir des mesures de r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9miques en lien avec la plainte. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la Commission fait valoir que, si le Tribunal conclut \u00e0 l\u2019existence de discrimination en se fondant notamment sur la preuve de nature syst\u00e9mique pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e au cours de l\u2019instance, il conviendrait que le Tribunal accorde des mesures de r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9miques. S\u2019appuyant sur l\u2019arr\u00eat de la Cour supr\u00eame Moore c. Colombie-Britannique (\u00c9ducation), 2012 CSC 61 (CanLII), le Tribunal des droits de la personne de la Colombie-Britannique (le \u00ab TDPCB \u00bb) a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : [traduction] \u00ab Il est vrai qu\u2019une plainte individuelle peut avoir des cons\u00e9quences \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9chelle syst\u00e9mique et, de fait, c\u2019est peut-\u00eatre ce que souhaite Mme Campbell dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte : Moore, au paragraphe 63 \u00bb (dans Campbell v. Vancouver Police Board (No. 2), 2019 BCHRT 128 (CanLII) [Campbell], au paragraphe 20).\n[19] Au d\u00e9but de son rapport de 83 pages, M. Milward pr\u00e9cise que les avocates des plaignants lui ont demand\u00e9 de r\u00e9pondre \u00e0 quatre questions. Il a toutefois formul\u00e9 ces \u00ab questions \u00bb de la mani\u00e8re suivante :\n1) La m\u00e9fiance, pass\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sente, des peuples autochtones au Canada \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC, y compris toute r\u00e9f\u00e9rence aux renseignements dont disposait la GRC en 2012 afin de d\u00e9terminer si elle \u00e9tait ou aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre au courant de cette m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque.\n2) Le r\u00f4le de la GRC sous le r\u00e9gime des pensionnats, en particulier en Colombie-Britannique, et les r\u00e9percussions qu\u2019a pu avoir ce r\u00f4le \u00e0 long terme.\n3) La preuve d\u2019une discrimination syst\u00e9mique, pass\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sente, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre des peuples autochtones au sein de la GRC.\n4) Les r\u00e9percussions de la conduite discriminatoire de la GRC sur les peuples autochtones, notamment en Colombie-Britannique.\n[20] Le rapport n\u2019est pas clairement organis\u00e9 en fonction de ces quatre questions ou \u00e9nonc\u00e9s. En fait, les principaux sujets abord\u00e9s dans le rapport sont identifi\u00e9s par des titres : outre les [traduction] \u00ab Questions trait\u00e9es dans le rapport \u00bb, on retrouve les \u00ab Qualifications \u00bb de M. Milward, la \u00ab M\u00e9thodologie \u00bb qu\u2019il a suivie pour pr\u00e9parer le rapport, ses neuf \u00ab Constats \u00bb, ainsi que l\u2019\u00ab Historique \u00bb, \u00ab La GRC et les pensionnats \u00bb, \u00ab Les femmes autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es \u00bb, \u00ab La m\u00e9moire collective \u00bb, \u00ab La GRC du Yukon \u00bb, \u00ab Le Rapport de Human Rights Watch \u00bb, \u00ab Les effets de la discrimination \u00bb, \u00ab La connaissance des probl\u00e8mes \u00bb et \u00ab Les conclusions \u00bb.\n[21] En ce qui concerne sa m\u00e9thodologie, M. Milward indique qu\u2019il n\u2019a fait aucune recherche originale pour pr\u00e9parer le rapport. En fait, le rapport [traduction] \u00ab est essentiellement une analyse documentaire et une synth\u00e8se des recherches pertinentes effectu\u00e9es ant\u00e9rieurement, lesquelles \u00e9taient en grande partie des recherches originales r\u00e9alis\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s des membres des communaut\u00e9s autochtones touch\u00e9es par les mesures prises par les agents de la GRC et aupr\u00e8s des membres de la GRC eux-m\u00eames \u00bb. Outre des articles universitaires, des livres, des m\u00e9moires de ma\u00eetrise et des articles de journaux, il s\u2019est particuli\u00e8rement appuy\u00e9 sur les cinq rapports suivants (r\u00e9f\u00e9rences compl\u00e8tes omises) :\nUn rapport de 2011 command\u00e9 par la GRC, lequel a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9dig\u00e9 par Marcel-Eug\u00e8ne LeBeuf et est intitul\u00e9 Le r\u00f4le de la Gendarmerie royale du Canada sous le r\u00e9gime des pensionnats indiens; Les rapports finaux de 2015 de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation du Canada, en particulier les volumes portant sur l\u2019histoire des pensionnats; R\u00e9clamer notre pouvoir et notre place : le rapport final de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es (2019); Un rapport de 2014 de la GRC intitul\u00e9 Les femmes autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es : Un aper\u00e7u op\u00e9rationnel national; Un rapport de 2013 de Human Rights Watch sur la conduite des membres de la GRC affect\u00e9s dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique intitul\u00e9 Ceux qui nous emm\u00e8nent : Abus policiers et lacunes dans la protection des femmes et filles autochtones dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique, Canada.\n[22] Dans son rapport, M. Milward tire des conclusions g\u00e9n\u00e9rales sur la m\u00e9fiance que se portent les communaut\u00e9s autochtones et la GRC dans tout le Canada, y compris dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique. Il indique que [traduction] \u00ab [l]a GRC a jou\u00e9 plusieurs r\u00f4les qui pourraient avoir amen\u00e9 les peuples autochtones \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper une m\u00e9moire collective n\u00e9gative \u00e0 son \u00e9gard \u00bb, notamment son r\u00f4le dans l\u2019affirmation de la souverainet\u00e9 canadienne, dans l\u2019application des mesures visant \u00e0 obliger les enfants autochtones \u00e0 fr\u00e9quenter les pensionnats, dans la suppression des cultures autochtones et dans la r\u00e9pression des manifestations autochtones.\n[23] M. Milward soutient que la m\u00e9moire collective n\u2019est [traduction] \u00ab ni immuable ni statique \u00bb, car elle peut \u00e9voluer dans le temps et s\u2019inscrire dans un contexte local. Il indique que certaines communaut\u00e9s autochtones au Canada peuvent avoir d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une m\u00e9moire collective positive \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC, bien que ce ne soit pas le cas dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique. Il conclut que, vu les [traduction] \u00ab ant\u00e9c\u00e9dents de n\u00e9gligence et de manque de professionnalisme \u00bb de la GRC dans cette r\u00e9gion, essentiellement en ce qui concerne la crise des femmes et des filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, les communaut\u00e9s autochtones de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur septentrional de la Colombie-Britannique ont peut-\u00eatre d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 une m\u00e9moire collective encore plus n\u00e9gative \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC.\n[24] Dans son rapport, M. Milward ne tire aucune conclusion pr\u00e9cise sur les exp\u00e9riences v\u00e9cues par les plaignants avec la GRC ou sur l\u2019enqu\u00eate qui fait l\u2019objet de la pr\u00e9sente plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne. Les plaignants soutiennent que le rapport de M. Milward est une preuve du contexte social qui aidera le Tribunal \u00e0 comprendre la relation entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones du nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[25] Je reconnais qu\u2019une preuve du contexte social peut permettre au Tribunal d\u2019\u00e9tablir un \u00ab cadre de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence ou le contexte pour trancher des questions factuelles cruciales pour le r\u00e8glement d\u2019un litige \u00bb (voir Campbell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 22, citant R. c. Le, 2019 CSC 34 (CanLII) [R. c. Le] au paragraphe 83 et R. c. Spence, 2005 CSC 71 (CanLII) [Spence] au paragraphe 57).\n[26] Je conviens que les plaignants peuvent pr\u00e9senter le rapport de M. Milward et faire t\u00e9moigner ce dernier en tant que t\u00e9moin expert sur la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones au Canada. La preuve devrait se limiter \u2014 de par sa nature et sa port\u00e9e \u2014 \u00e0 ce sujet et pourrait inclure des \u00e9l\u00e9ments relatifs \u00e0 la m\u00e9fiance, pass\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sente, des peuples autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC, notamment dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[27] La preuve du contexte social de M. Milward ne remplacera pas l\u2019exercice d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation des faits effectu\u00e9 par le Tribunal, lequel exercice sera fond\u00e9 sur la preuve produite par les parties dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente plainte. De plus, les plaignants ne peuvent pas demander \u00e0 M. Milward de donner son opinion sur les questions fondamentales que doit trancher le Tribunal en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, comme l\u2019existence de discrimination individuelle ou syst\u00e9mique par rapport aux faits de la plainte.\nB. Les facteurs de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan contest\u00e9s\n(i) La preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e est pertinente\n[28] Pour d\u00e9terminer la pertinence du rapport, je dois examiner si les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve propos\u00e9s sont logiquement pertinents par rapport \u00e0 un fait en cause dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte (R. c. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 (CanLII) [Abbey], au paragraphe 82). La GRC soutient que la preuve d\u2019expert doit \u00eatre li\u00e9e aux faits de l\u2019affaire et que les \u00e9v\u00e9nements sur lesquels M. Milward se prononce ne concernent aucunement la pr\u00e9sente affaire.\n[29] Les parties ne s\u2019entendent pas sur la port\u00e9e de la plainte d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s du Tribunal \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 que la GRC d\u00e9finit l\u2019objet de la plainte plus \u00e9troitement que ne le font les plaignants et la Commission. Le Tribunal a d\u00e9j\u00e0 conclu que ce sont les expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les parties qui \u00e9noncent les conditions plus pr\u00e9cises de l\u2019audience, et non la plainte initialement d\u00e9pos\u00e9e aupr\u00e8s de la Commission canadienne des droits de la personne (Casler c. Compagnie des chemins de fer nationaux du Canada, 2017 TCDP 6 (CanLII), au paragraphe 9).\n[30] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions et dans la pr\u00e9sente requ\u00eate, la GRC soutient que la seule question que doit trancher le Tribunal est celle de savoir [traduction] \u00ab si le caporal Mackie [...] a men\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate de mani\u00e8re discriminatoire \u00bb. Elle d\u00e9clare que toute preuve d\u2019opinion devrait \u00eatre pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e en tenant compte de cette question bien pr\u00e9cise et que le rapport de M. Milward [traduction] \u00ab non seulement ne r\u00e9pond pas cette question, mais il ne l\u2019aborde m\u00eame pas \u00bb.\n[31] L\u2019enqu\u00eate du caporal Mackie portait sur une plainte d\u2019agression sexuelle subie pendant l\u2019enfance d\u00e9pos\u00e9e par une personne qui avait fr\u00e9quent\u00e9 l\u2019\u00e9cole Immaculata. Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la GRC indique que l\u2019enqu\u00eate du caporal Mackie \u00e9tait d\u00e9taill\u00e9e et circonspecte et qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas discriminatoire. Elle souligne \u00e9galement qu\u2019en plus de l\u2019enqu\u00eate du caporal Mackie, elle a ouvert un nouveau dossier \u2014 dirig\u00e9 par autre agent \u2014 afin d\u2019enqu\u00eater sur des d\u00e9clarations plus g\u00e9n\u00e9rales concernant des violences physiques subies \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9cole Immaculata. Aucune des deux enqu\u00eates ne s\u2019est sold\u00e9e par le d\u00e9p\u00f4t d\u2019accusations puisque la GRC a conclu qu\u2019aucun motif raisonnable et probable ne justifiait le renvoi des accusations \u00e0 la Couronne ni la tenue d\u2019une enqu\u00eate plus pouss\u00e9e.\n[32] Dans leur r\u00e9ponse \u00e0 l\u2019expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions de la GRC, les plaignants contestent le fait que leur plainte se limite \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate que le caporal Mackie a men\u00e9e sur une plainte au criminel ou \u00e0 l\u2019issue de cette enqu\u00eate. Ils affirment que leur plainte concerne plut\u00f4t la discrimination exerc\u00e9e par la GRC dans le cadre de son enqu\u00eate sur les mauvais traitements inflig\u00e9s par des membres du personnel de l\u2019\u00e9cole en Colombie-Britannique, tels qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 rapport\u00e9s par les six plaignants et de nombreux autres t\u00e9moins.\n[33] Dans leur expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, les plaignants d\u00e9clarent que la GRC a eu recours \u00e0 des pratiques d\u2019enqu\u00eate traditionnelles lorsqu\u2019elle a enqu\u00eat\u00e9 sur des all\u00e9gations de mauvais traitements autrefois inflig\u00e9s \u00e0 des enfants autochtones. Par exemple, ils soutiennent que la GRC a non seulement omis de demander des ordonnances de production pour pouvoir obtenir les notes ou les dossiers pertinents, mais qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas communiqu\u00e9 avec toutes les personnes qui avaient souscrit des affidavits ou fait des d\u00e9clarations ou ne les a pas interrog\u00e9es; qu\u2019elle a exig\u00e9 que les plaignants communiquent avec elle, et non le contraire; qu\u2019elle n\u2019a offert aucun soutien \u00e0 la plupart des victimes qui signalaient des s\u00e9vices et devaient vivre avec la douleur et le traumatisme, et n\u2019a pas offert de services de traduction aux plaignants qui ne parlaient que le carrier; qu\u2019elle a jug\u00e9 que certains t\u00e9moins se montraient peu coop\u00e9ratifs, mais n\u2019a pas tenu compte des traumatismes collectifs ou interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels qu\u2019ils avaient subis; qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas v\u00e9rifi\u00e9 les renseignements fournis au sujet des s\u00e9vices inflig\u00e9s au Prince George College et dans d\u2019autres \u00e9coles du dioc\u00e8se; et qu\u2019elle n\u2019a pas inform\u00e9 les personnes qu\u2019elle avait interrog\u00e9es des r\u00e9sultats de l\u2019enqu\u00eate.\n[34] Les plaignants soutiennent que les pratiques d\u2019enqu\u00eate traditionnelles de la GRC sont discriminatoires en ce qu\u2019elles ne r\u00e9pondent pas aux besoins des Autochtones victimes de violence. Ils affirment avoir subi des effets pr\u00e9judiciables du fait de leur race, car les st\u00e9r\u00e9otypes et les pr\u00e9jug\u00e9s de la GRC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des plaignants autochtones ont nui \u00e0 la conduite de l\u2019enqu\u00eate. Ils soutiennent que la discrimination \u00e9tait syst\u00e9mique et demandent au Tribunal d\u2019accorder des mesures de r\u00e9paration syst\u00e9miques, notamment que la GRC modifie ses pratiques traditionnelles afin de r\u00e9pondre aux besoins culturels des peuples autochtones.\n[35] Dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, la Commission d\u00e9clare que le Tribunal doit tenir compte du contexte social dans lequel la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en \u00e9valuant la plainte \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des effets, pass\u00e9s et pr\u00e9sents, du colonialisme et des traumatismes historiques subis par les peuples autochtones. Elle affirme que les plaignants \u00e9tablissent un lien clair entre la m\u00e9fiance qu\u2019ils \u00e9prouvent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC en raison de l\u2019h\u00e9ritage colonial du Canada et la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la GRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e et les a touch\u00e9s.\n[36] Compte tenu des expos\u00e9s des pr\u00e9cisions d\u00e9pos\u00e9s par les parties, je reconnais que la plainte renvoy\u00e9e au Tribunal aux fins de l\u2019instruction ne se limite pas \u00e0 la question de savoir si l\u2019enqu\u00eate du caporal Mackie \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[37] Il incombe aux plaignants d\u2019\u00e9tablir, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, une preuve prima facie de discrimination. Les plaignants soutiennent que la preuve fournie par l\u2019expert, M. Milward, les aidera \u00e0 prouver la discrimination puisqu\u2019elle permettra de d\u00e9montrer que la GRC savait, ou aurait d\u00fb savoir, que les peuples autochtones du nord de la Colombie-Britannique ne lui faisaient vraisemblablement pas confiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle menait son enqu\u00eate. Bien que les plaignants et leurs t\u00e9moins puissent t\u00e9moigner de leur propre m\u00e9fiance \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC, ils ne peuvent pas prouver ce que la GRC savait, ou aurait d\u00fb savoir. Les plaignants affirment que la GRC n\u2019a pas encore fait conna\u00eetre sa position \u00e0 ce sujet. Toutefois, ils affirment que la preuve de M. Milward permettra de r\u00e9futer la th\u00e8se de la GRC selon laquelle elle ignorait que les Autochtones avaient une m\u00e9moire sociale n\u00e9gative ou une m\u00e9fiance collective \u00e0 son \u00e9gard.\n[38] Les plaignants affirment \u00e9galement que, m\u00eame si leur plainte concerne l\u2019enqu\u00eate men\u00e9e par la GRC sur les s\u00e9vices qu\u2019ils ont subis pendant leur enfance dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique, elle [traduction] \u00ab refl\u00e8te les exp\u00e9riences de nombreux peuples autochtones dans tout le pays \u00bb. Ils ajoutent que leur plainte d\u00e9montre l\u2019existence d\u2019une discrimination syst\u00e9mique dans les techniques d\u2019enqu\u00eate polici\u00e8re et d\u00e9crit les effets pr\u00e9judiciables subis par les Autochtones victimes de violence, comme le fait de ne pas \u00eatre crus ou de faire l\u2019objet d\u2019enqu\u00eates inad\u00e9quates, de recevoir peu ou pas de soutien ou de ne pas \u00eatre trait\u00e9s avec respect et dignit\u00e9.\n[39] Les plaignants affirment que la preuve de M. Milward est essentielle \u00e0 leur all\u00e9gation de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, car il est important que le Tribunal sache comment la GRC s\u2019est conduite au fil du temps, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que la GRC avait recours \u00e0 des pratiques qui t\u00e9moignaient d\u2019une culture de discrimination syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Autochtones. Ils affirment que seul un expert qualifi\u00e9 \u00e0 analyser la conduite historique de la GRC, comme M. Milward, peut apporter cette preuve.\n[40] Selon la GRC, M. Milward n\u2019\u00e9met dans son rapport aucune opinion quant \u00e0 une conduite discriminatoire qu\u2019aurait pu adopter le caporal Mackie ou la GRC dans le cadre de la pr\u00e9sente affaire, ne fait \u00e9tat d\u2019aucune lacune particuli\u00e8re dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la GRC et ne propose aucune autre technique d\u2019enqu\u00eate qui, \u00e0 son avis, aurait \u00e9t\u00e9 exempte de toute discrimination. La GRC soutient que M. Milward aurait d\u00fb exposer les faits qu\u2019il a tenus pour acquis, puis formuler une opinion de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00e9tablir un lien avec les all\u00e9gations historiques contenues dans son rapport.\n[41] Or, rien n\u2019oblige un t\u00e9moin expert \u00e0 \u00e9mettre une opinion sur les faits de la plainte (voir McKay v. Toronto Police Services Board, 2011 HRTO 499 (CanLII) [McKay], au paragraphe 95). Comme il a d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9t\u00e9 mentionn\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a conclu que les \u00ab faits sociaux \u00bb qui ne se rapportent pas aux circonstances d\u2019une affaire en particulier, mais qui sont correctement reli\u00e9s aux faits en litige, peuvent \u00eatre admis pour expliquer certains aspects de la preuve, comme les \u00ab difficult\u00e9s que rencontrent les autochtones dans le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale et dans la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral \u00bb (dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Spence, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 57).\n[42] En ce qui concerne l\u2019argument de la GRC selon lequel le rapport de M. Milward porte sur des sujets qui ne sont pas pertinents \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente instruction, comme le r\u00f4le de la GRC sous le r\u00e9gime des pensionnats et les erreurs qu\u2019elle a commises dans l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, je reconnais que ces renseignements ont \u00e9t\u00e9 ajout\u00e9s au rapport parce qu\u2019ils appartiennent \u00e0 la m\u00e9moire collective autochtone dont traite M. Milward. Je suis d\u2019accord avec la position que la Commission a exprim\u00e9e dans son expos\u00e9 des pr\u00e9cisions, \u00e0 savoir que le Tribunal doit tenir compte du contexte social dans lequel la plainte pour atteinte aux droits de la personne a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9pos\u00e9e en \u00e9valuant la plainte \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des effets du colonialisme et des traumatismes historiques subis par les peuples autochtones. La Commission a raison de dire que les plaignants \u00e9tablissent un lien clair entre la m\u00e9fiance qu\u2019ils \u00e9prouvent \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC en raison de l\u2019h\u00e9ritage colonial du Canada et la mani\u00e8re dont l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la GRC a \u00e9t\u00e9 men\u00e9e et les a touch\u00e9s.\n[43] Je conviens que le Tribunal a tout int\u00e9r\u00eat, lorsqu\u2019il examine les faits et tranche les questions soulev\u00e9es en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce, \u00e0 comprendre le mieux possible le contexte propre aux parties.\n[44] La GRC soutient \u00e9galement que le rapport de M. Milward, dans la mesure o\u00f9 il r\u00e9v\u00e8le que l\u2019enqu\u00eate du caporal Mackie \u00e9tait discriminatoire ou qu\u2019elle n\u2019\u00e9tait pas exhaustive, n\u2019est pas pertinent puisque des plaintes similaires ont \u00e9t\u00e9 jug\u00e9es non fond\u00e9es par la Commission civile d\u2019examen et de traitement des plaintes (la \u00ab CCETP \u00bb). Les plaignants affirment que les conclusions de la CCETP ne sont pas pertinentes en ce qui concerne l\u2019all\u00e9gation selon laquelle les m\u00e9thodes d\u2019enqu\u00eate sont discriminatoires. Je partage l\u2019avis des plaignants, car le rapport de la CCETP, fourni par la GRC, ne semble pas porter sur des all\u00e9gations selon lesquelles l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00e9tait discriminatoire.\n[45] Je conviens que le rapport de M. Milward est logiquement pertinent lorsqu\u2019il s\u2019agit de d\u00e9terminer si la GRC savait, ou aurait d\u00fb savoir, que les peuples autochtones du nord de la Colombie-Britannique se m\u00e9fiaient d\u2019elle \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9poque o\u00f9 elle a men\u00e9 son enqu\u00eate. Il est donc pertinent par rapport \u00e0 l\u2019argument des plaignants selon lequel l\u2019enqu\u00eate de la GRC aurait d\u00fb \u00eatre adapt\u00e9e pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des plaignants autochtones. Par cons\u00e9quent, la preuve propos\u00e9e satisfait au crit\u00e8re de la pertinence.\n[46] Les parties seront autoris\u00e9es \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter leurs arguments sur la pertinence de la preuve de M. Milward par rapport \u00e0 d\u2019autres faits ou questions soulev\u00e9es dans l\u2019affaire, notamment les all\u00e9gations de discrimination syst\u00e9mique, ainsi que sur le poids que le Tribunal devrait accorder \u00e0 la preuve de M. Milward.\n(ii) La preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e est n\u00e9cessaire\n[47] Le crit\u00e8re de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 est respect\u00e9 si la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e permet au Tribunal d\u2019appr\u00e9cier les questions en litige en lui fournissant des renseignements qui d\u00e9passent son exp\u00e9rience et ses connaissances (Bingley, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 15; Mohan, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 23).\n[48] La GRC soutient que le rapport de M. Milward n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal puisqu\u2019il est essentiellement fond\u00e9 sur des rapports ou des recherches qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 publi\u00e9s. Elle laisse entendre que M. Milward consid\u00e8re les opinions formul\u00e9es dans le rapport de Human Rights Watch comme des faits et qu\u2019il s\u2019en sert pour \u00e9tayer la position des plaignants. Comme elle ne peut pas contre-interroger Human Rights Watch ou contester ses conclusions, la GRC soutient qu\u2019il serait contraire \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 proc\u00e9durale d\u2019autoriser un t\u00e9moignage d\u2019expert fond\u00e9 sur ces conclusions.\n[49] Un argument similaire a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire Campbell, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, et le TDPCB l\u2019a rejet\u00e9 :\n[traduction] Enfin, le [Conseil de police de Vancouver] s\u2019oppose \u00e0 ce que M. Miller s\u2019appuie sur des sources secondaires, qui ne peuvent pas faire l\u2019objet d\u2019un contre-interrogatoire. Il ne cite ni jurisprudence ni doctrine \u00e0 l\u2019appui de son objection et je n\u2019en connais aucune. De par la nature m\u00eame de la preuve d\u2019expert en mati\u00e8re de sciences sociales, il est raisonnable de s\u2019attendre \u00e0 ce qu\u2019un expert s\u2019appuie sur le travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par d\u2019autres et l\u2019incorpore au sien. Je ne pense pas que cet argument justifie que le rapport soit jug\u00e9 inadmissible en tout ou en partie (au paragraphe 29).\n[50] Je suis du m\u00eame avis que le TDPCB \u00e0 ce sujet. Les t\u00e9moins experts peuvent fonder leur opinion sur des rapports et des \u00e9tudes. Dans la d\u00e9cision McWilliam v. Toronto Police Services Board, 2017 HRTO 19 (CanLII) [McWilliam], le Tribunal des droits de la personne de l\u2019Ontario (le \u00ab TDPO \u00bb) a autoris\u00e9 un expert \u00e0 t\u00e9moigner sur le contexte social li\u00e9 au genre dans les services de police et n\u2019a pas jug\u00e9 que le fait que l\u2019expert ait cit\u00e9 diverses \u00e9tudes \u00e9quivalait \u00e0 du ou\u00ef-dire ou \u00e0 un [traduction] \u00ab t\u00e9moignage justificatif \u00bb (aux paragraphes 48-50).\n[51] La GRC soutient \u00e9galement que le rapport, pour autant qu\u2019il vise \u00e0 justifier le t\u00e9moignage des plaignants, constitue une preuve justificative et est donc inadmissible. Elle affirme que quatre des neuf \u00ab constats \u00bb de M. Milward vont \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les t\u00e9moignages justificatifs puisqu\u2019ils visent \u00e0 renforcer la preuve pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e par les plaignants au sujet de leur relation avec la GRC. Ces constats ont trait \u00e0 la conduite de la GRC qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 signal\u00e9e dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique (par exemple, des actes qui correspondent \u00e0 du profilage racial et la mauvaise gestion des plaintes d\u00e9pos\u00e9es par des Autochtones, ainsi que la victimisation criminelle des Autochtones). Selon M. Milward, ces agissements auraient eu un effet n\u00e9gatif sur la m\u00e9moire collective qu\u2019avaient les Autochtones de la GRC dans cette r\u00e9gion et auraient eu des [traduction] \u00ab effets sociaux tangibles \u00bb, notamment un manque de confiance en la capacit\u00e9 ou en la volont\u00e9 de la GRC de traiter les Autochtones de mani\u00e8re \u00e9quitable ou de les prot\u00e9ger, et auraient pu s\u2019ajouter aux effets persistants des traumatismes interg\u00e9n\u00e9rationnels.\n[52] La r\u00e8gle interdisant les t\u00e9moignages justificatifs \u00ab veut que la preuve produite \u00e0 seule fin de prouver qu\u2019un t\u00e9moin dit la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 soit inadmissible \u00bb (R. c. Burns, 1994 CanLII 127 (CSC), au paragraphe 28). Je ne suis pas d\u2019accord avec la GRC pour dire que la preuve d\u2019opinion de M. Milward, que ce soit par rapport \u00e0 ces quatre constats ou de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, irait \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la r\u00e8gle interdisant les t\u00e9moignages justificatifs puisque cette preuve n\u2019est pas produite \u00e0 seule fin de prouver que les plaignants ou leurs t\u00e9moins disent la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\n[53] Tant que M. Milward reste objectif, le fait que sa preuve soutienne la th\u00e8se des plaignants ne la rend pas irrecevable. Comme la cour l\u2019a indiqu\u00e9 dans la d\u00e9cision Peart v. Peel (Regional Municipality) Police Services Board, 2003 CanLII 42339 (CS Ont.) [Peart] :\n[traduction] Il s\u2019agit l\u00e0 du r\u00f4le habituel de l\u2019expert : fournir au tribunal une conclusion toute faite fond\u00e9e sur des connaissances scientifiques, m\u00e9dicales, psychiatriques, techniques ou autres, que le tribunal peut tirer si l\u2019existence de certains faits sous-jacents est d\u00e9montr\u00e9e. [...] Or, c\u2019est le tribunal qui tire la conclusion (au paragraphe 23).\n[54] L\u2019opinion de M. Milward ne saurait remplacer l\u2019analyse de la preuve faite par le Tribunal. Lorsqu\u2019il examine les \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve dont il dispose, le Tribunal peut tenir compte de la relation entre la GRC et les Autochtones du nord de la Colombie-Britannique dans son contexte historique et racial, tel qu\u2019il a \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 par M. Milward. Par ailleurs, le Tribunal n\u2019est pas tenu d\u2019accepter l\u2019opinion ou la conclusion d\u2019un t\u00e9moin expert. Il peut l\u2019accepter s\u2019il est [traduction] \u00ab convaincu, selon la pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rance des probabilit\u00e9s, qu\u2019il s\u2019agit de l\u2019explication la plus probable en ce qui a trait aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements en question \u00bb (Peart, au paragraphe 23).\n[55] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, le juge Sopinka a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ce qui suit : \u00ab [J]e ne jugerais pas la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 selon une norme trop stricte. L\u2019exigence est que l\u2019opinion soit n\u00e9cessaire au sens qu\u2019elle fournit des renseignements \u201cqui, selon toute vraisemblance, d\u00e9passent l\u2019exp\u00e9rience et la connaissance d\u2019un juge ou d\u2019un jury\u201d \u00bb (\u00e0 la page 23). Le TDPO a indiqu\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab dans les affaires de discrimination, le seuil applicable pour d\u00e9montrer que la preuve est n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le juge des faits est moins \u00e9lev\u00e9 que dans les affaires criminelles, et ce, en raison de la nature des instances en mati\u00e8re de droit de la personne et de la nature souvent subtile de la discrimination \u00bb (McWilliam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 46; Nassiah v. Peel Regional Police Services Board, 2006 HRTO 18 (CanLII) [Nassiah], aux paragraphes 36 et 37).\n[56] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les plaignants pour dire que le Tribunal pourrait b\u00e9n\u00e9ficier de la capacit\u00e9 de M. Milward de passer en revue et de critiquer les rapports volumineux pertinents puisque ce dernier conna\u00eet le sujet et poss\u00e8de l\u2019expertise n\u00e9cessaire pour \u00e9valuer la validit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes de sciences sociales et que le Tribunal n\u2019a ni la capacit\u00e9 ni l\u2019expertise n\u00e9cessaires pour le faire. Comme l\u2019a pr\u00e9cis\u00e9 la Commission des droits de la personne de la Nouvelle-\u00c9cosse, les tribunaux des droits de la personne :\n[traduction] sont pr\u00e9sum\u00e9s poss\u00e9der une certaine expertise dans le domaine de la discrimination et des droits de la personne, mais ils ne poss\u00e8dent pas n\u00e9cessairement des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es sur les pratiques et les effets du racisme, si ce n\u2019est une simple compr\u00e9hension de leur dynamique. [...] Le racisme rev\u00eat de nombreuses formes, est pr\u00e9sent dans bien d\u2019environnements diff\u00e9rents et est \u00e9tudi\u00e9 par divers sp\u00e9cialistes en sciences sociales au moyen de diff\u00e9rentes m\u00e9thodologies. Il est peu probable qu\u2019une commission d\u2019enqu\u00eate soit au courant de tous ces ouvrages [...] Une fa\u00e7on de pr\u00e9senter une telle preuve \u00e0 une commission consiste bien s\u00fbr \u00e0 soumettre des ouvrages publi\u00e9s sur les questions pertinentes, mais il est impossible de contre-interroger des ouvrages [Johnson v. Halifax Regional Police Service, 2003 CanLII 89397 (CDPN\u00c9), au paragraphe 85].\n[57] Dans l\u2019affaire Radek v. Henderson Development (Canada) Ltd. and others (No.2), 2004 BCHRT 340 (CanLII), le TDPCB a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que [traduction] \u00ab des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve peuvent \u00eatre n\u00e9cessaires pour clarifier les questions en litige ou pour les mettre en contexte \u00bb (au paragraphe 33). J\u2019estime que le rapport de M. Milward est n\u00e9cessaire pour aider le Tribunal \u00e0 bien appr\u00e9cier le contexte social qui sous-tend la plainte, \u00e0 savoir la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les Autochtones au Canada, y compris dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[58] Bien que le Tribunal puisse lire les rapports accessibles au public auxquels M. Milward fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence dans son propre rapport, il est impossible de contre-interroger des rapports. La GRC peut toutefois contre-interroger M. Milward si elle souhaite remettre en question le fondement de ses opinions ou demander des pr\u00e9cisions sur sa m\u00e9thodologie ou son analyse. Par ailleurs, M. Milward a indiqu\u00e9 quels \u00e9taient les aspects des \u00e9tudes et des rapports qu\u2019il critiquait sur les plans de la m\u00e9thodologie ou de l\u2019interpr\u00e9tation. Or, le Tribunal n\u2019a pas cette expertise. Comme le notent les plaignants, c\u2019est gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses exp\u00e9riences professionnelles et acad\u00e9miques, d\u00e9crites en d\u00e9tail dans la section suivante, que M. Milward peut analyser ces documents alors que le Tribunal n\u2019a ni l\u2019exp\u00e9rience ni les connaissances n\u00e9cessaires.\n(iii) M. Milward est un expert suffisamment qualifi\u00e9\n[59] Un t\u00e9moin suffisamment qualifi\u00e9 est quelqu\u2019un qui \u00ab a acquis des connaissances sp\u00e9ciales ou particuli\u00e8res gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 des \u00e9tudes ou \u00e0 une exp\u00e9rience relatives aux questions vis\u00e9es dans son t\u00e9moignage \u00bb (Mohan, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, \u00e0 la page 27). Un expert [traduction] \u00ab doit non seulement \u00eatre g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement qualifi\u00e9, mais il doit aussi \u00eatre qualifi\u00e9 pour exprimer l\u2019opinion propos\u00e9e \u00bb (R. v. Orr, 2015 BCCA 88, au paragraphe 67).\n[60] Les plaignants soutiennent que M. Milward a toutes les qualifications requises pour fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les Autochtones au Canada. Selon eux, M. Milward [traduction] \u00ab a, de par sa formation universitaire, des connaissances et des comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es en ce qui concerne les interactions entre les peuples autochtones et les corps policiers et il a l\u2019exp\u00e9rience voulue pour \u00e9valuer la validit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes en sciences sociales \u00bb.\n[61] Au d\u00e9but de son rapport, M. Milward indique qu\u2019il est professeur agr\u00e9g\u00e9 de droit \u00e0 l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de Victoria et directeur par int\u00e9rim du programme d\u2019\u00e9tudes conjoint ax\u00e9 sur common law et le syst\u00e8me juridique autochtone (Joint Indigenous Law Degree) de l\u2019Universit\u00e9. Ses [traduction] \u00ab recherches universitaires portent sur les interactions entre les peuples autochtones et le syst\u00e8me de justice p\u00e9nale canadien [...] [y compris] les interactions entre les peuples autochtones et l\u2019\u00c9tat canadien \u00bb. Il indique que ses recherches sont tr\u00e8s interdisciplinaires puisqu\u2019elles reposent sur des domaines tels que l\u2019anthropologie, l\u2019histoire, l\u2019ethnohistoire, la criminologie et la sociologie, en plus du droit.\n[62] Selon le curriculum vitae de M. Milward, il est titulaire d\u2019un doctorat en droit de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 de la Colombie-Britannique et il est l\u2019auteur d\u2019un livre intitul\u00e9 Aboriginal Justice and the Charter: Realizing a Culturally Sensitive Interpretation of Legal Rights in Canada (La justice autochtone et la Charte : faire une interpr\u00e9tation des garanties juridiques au Canada qui soit adapt\u00e9e \u00e0 la r\u00e9alit\u00e9 culturelle) (Vancouver : UBC Press, 2012), ainsi que du chapitre d\u2019un livre et de plusieurs articles \u00e9valu\u00e9s par des pairs.\n[63] M. Milward indique dans son rapport que certains de ses travaux ont port\u00e9 sur les interactions entre les corps policiers et les peuples autochtones. Par exemple, plusieurs sections de son livre de 2012 traitent de ce sujet, tout comme son article paru dans le Criminal Law Quarterly en 2012 qui porte express\u00e9ment sur le profilage policier des peuples autochtones, qui sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme des menaces potentielles pour la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 dans un contexte de r\u00e9pression des manifestations autochtones.\n[64] Je reconnais que, gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 ses \u00e9tudes universitaires et \u00e0 son travail en tant que professeur et chercheur interdisciplinaire, M. Milward a acquis des connaissances sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es sur les questions vis\u00e9es dans son t\u00e9moignage. \u00c0 mon avis, il est qualifi\u00e9 pour t\u00e9moigner sur la relation qui existe entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones, y compris dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[65] La GRC n\u2019a pas soulev\u00e9 d\u2019objection quant aux qualifications du professeur Milward. Elle affirme plut\u00f4t que la principale obligation de l\u2019expert propos\u00e9 consiste \u00e0 apporter une aide juste, objective et impartiale et soutient que M. Milward est bien loin de respecter cette exigence. Elle ajoute que M. Milward n\u2019est pas neutre, mais qu\u2019il va jusqu\u2019\u00e0 plaider sa cause en critiquant la conduite de la GRC. La GRC soutient que M. Milward fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des \u00e9v\u00e9nements qui ne sont pas pertinents par rapport aux faits de la plainte et qu\u2019il semble [traduction] \u00ab accepter comme faits av\u00e9r\u00e9s des t\u00e9moignages non prouv\u00e9s obtenus dans le cadre d\u2019enqu\u00eates n\u2019ayant aucun lien avec la pr\u00e9sente affaire \u00bb, qu\u2019il \u00ab se prononce sur d\u2019autres \u00e9v\u00e9nements \u00bb, qu\u2019il \u00ab fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 des p\u00e9riodes post\u00e9rieures \u00e0 l\u2019enqu\u00eate \u00bb, qu\u2019il s\u2019appuie sur \u00ab de vagues sentiments n\u00e9gatifs, injustifi\u00e9s ou g\u00e9n\u00e9ralis\u00e9s, \u00e0 l\u2019encontre de la GRC, dont beaucoup constituent du ou\u00ef-dire \u00bb et qu\u2019il \u00ab cite de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9sinvolte des propos incendiaires et pr\u00e9judiciables \u00bb.\n[66] La GRC donne des exemples qui, selon elle, \u00e9tayent la th\u00e8se de M. Milward selon laquelle la GRC s\u2019est conduite de mani\u00e8re inacceptable dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique, dont le fait qu\u2019il se soit appuy\u00e9 sur le rapport de Human Rights Watch et qu\u2019il ait d\u00e9clar\u00e9 que le comportement des agents de la GRC dans le nord [traduction] \u00ab pourrait avoir introduit dans les communaut\u00e9s autochtones de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur septentrional de la province un traumatisme caus\u00e9 par la GRC plut\u00f4t que par les pensionnats indiens \u00bb. Elle soutient que, comme M. Milward n\u2019est pas en mesure de s\u2019acquitter des obligations qui lui incombent \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert, il n\u2019est pas d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9 pour en \u00eatre un.\n[67] Les plaignants ne sont pas d\u2019accord pour dire que le rapport de M. Milward frise le plaidoyer et ils s\u2019appuient sur ses exceptionnelles comp\u00e9tences et sur le formulaire d\u2019attestation de l\u2019obligation de l\u2019expert qu\u2019il a sign\u00e9 de sa main et qu\u2019il a remis en m\u00eame temps que son rapport et son curriculum vitae. M. Milward reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il doit fournir une preuve d\u2019opinion juste, objective et impartiale qui rel\u00e8ve de son domaine d\u2019expertise et que cette obligation l\u2019emporte sur toute autre obligation qu\u2019il pourrait avoir envers les plaignants, pour qui il travaille.\n[68] La GRC conteste que le fait que M. Milward ait reconnu les obligations qui lui incombent \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert prouve qu\u2019il est apte \u00e0 fournir \u00ab une preuve juste, objective et impartiale \u00bb. Elle soutient que, si les experts pouvaient [traduction] \u00ab reconna\u00eetre eux-m\u00eames leur qualit\u00e9 d\u2019expert \u00bb, le Tribunal n\u2019aurait pas \u00e0 \u00e9valuer l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de leur t\u00e9moignage.\n[69] Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 qu\u2019une fois que l\u2019expert a produit l\u2019attestation par laquelle il reconna\u00eet l\u2019obligation qui lui incombe de fournir une preuve impartiale, ind\u00e9pendante et sans parti pris, il revient \u00e0 la partie qui s\u2019oppose \u00e0 l\u2019admission du t\u00e9moignage de d\u00e9montrer un motif r\u00e9aliste de le juger inadmissible au motif que l\u2019expert ne peut ou ne veut s\u2019acquitter de son obligation (au paragraphe 48). La Cour a reconnu qu\u2019un expert qui se fait le d\u00e9fenseur d\u2019une partie \u00ab ne peut ou ne veut manifestement pas s\u2019acquitter de sa principale obligation envers le tribunal \u00bb, mais elle a indiqu\u00e9 que la d\u00e9cision d\u2019exclure le t\u00e9moignage \u00e0 cette \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse ne serait prise que tr\u00e8s rarement et uniquement dans les cas les plus manifestes. Dans les cas o\u00f9 l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 ou le refus de fournir une preuve juste, objective et impartiale n\u2019est pas manifeste, le t\u00e9moignage ne devrait pas \u00eatre exclu d\u2019office et son admissibilit\u00e9 devrait \u00eatre d\u00e9termin\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019issue d\u2019une pond\u00e9ration globale des co\u00fbts et des b\u00e9n\u00e9fices de son admission (White Burgess, au paragraphe 49).\n[70] La GRC soutient que le rapport de M. Milward constitue une [traduction] \u00ab critique virulente de la GRC \u00bb, qu\u2019il passe en revue des \u00e9v\u00e9nements r\u00e9cents qui n\u2019ont aucun lien avec l\u2019enqu\u00eate faisant l\u2019objet de la plainte et qu\u2019il mentionne peu, voire pas du tout, le bien que la GRC a fait dans les communaut\u00e9s autochtones et dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique. La GRC ajoute que tous ces \u00e9l\u00e9ments illustrent la partialit\u00e9 du rapport et le fait que M. Milward n\u2019est pas un expert d\u00fbment qualifi\u00e9 puisqu\u2019il se fait le d\u00e9fenseur des plaignants.\n[71] Je conviens avec les plaignants que les exemples ou les propos utilis\u00e9s par la GRC pour montrer que M. Milward se fait le d\u00e9fenseur des plaignants ont \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9s du contexte global du rapport et que la lecture du rapport dans son int\u00e9gralit\u00e9 permet de mieux les comprendre. Je reconnais que le rapport de M. Milward, qui s\u2019appuie notamment sur des rapports ant\u00e9rieurs, offre le contexte social permettant de comprendre la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones au Canada, y compris dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique.\n[72] La GRC peut pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve pour contredire tout ou partie du rapport de M. Milward ou pour aborder des sujets qui ne sont pas trait\u00e9s en d\u00e9tail dans le rapport, notamment des \u00e9l\u00e9ments prouvant que la GRC a r\u00e9alis\u00e9 de bonnes choses dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique. On peut supposer que ses propres t\u00e9moins, qui ont travaill\u00e9 dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique, seraient en mesure de fournir cette preuve. M. Milward reconna\u00eet qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas fait de recherches originales pour pr\u00e9parer son rapport, mais qu\u2019il a plut\u00f4t examin\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes et des rapports d\u00e9j\u00e0 publi\u00e9s, dont la plupart reposaient sur des recherches men\u00e9es aupr\u00e8s des membres des communaut\u00e9s autochtones et de la GRC. S\u2019il existe des \u00e9tudes ou des rapports qui contiennent des renseignements contradictoires ou qui proposent une analyse diff\u00e9rente des renseignements fournis par M. Milward, la GRC peut chercher \u00e0 les faire admettre en preuve lors de l\u2019instruction.\n[73] Je ne consid\u00e8re pas le rapport de M. Milward comme une [traduction] \u00ab critique virulente de la GRC \u00bb. Je tiens \u00e0 souligner que, dans son rapport, M. Milward pr\u00e9sente l\u2019histoire des peuples autochtones et de la GRC comme \u00e9tant nuanc\u00e9e et qu\u2019il \u00e9crit \u00e0 plusieurs reprises que la GRC peut surmonter [traduction] \u00ab la m\u00e9moire sociale n\u00e9gative qu\u2019ont par d\u00e9faut les peuples autochtones \u00bb et qu\u2019elle y est parvenue. M. Milward affirme que la m\u00e9moire sociale que partagent certaines communaut\u00e9s autochtones \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC est devenue plus positive gr\u00e2ce aux [traduction] \u00ab mesures positives prises au fil du temps \u00bb.\n[74] Je suis d\u2019accord avec les plaignants pour dire que le simple fait que la GRC n\u2019aime pas ou n\u2019approuve pas les opinions de M. Milward ne les rend pas injustes ou partisanes.\n[75] En ce qui concerne la pr\u00e9occupation de la GRC selon laquelle le rapport de M. Milward n\u2019est pas \u00ab neutre \u00bb, mais qu\u2019il frise le plaidoyer, je note que rien n\u2019exige que la preuve d\u2019expert soit neutre. La preuve d\u2019expert doit plut\u00f4t \u00eatre \u00ab impartiale, en ce sens qu\u2019elle d\u00e9coule d\u2019un examen objectif des questions \u00e0 trancher \u00bb (White Burgess, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 32). Comme le TDPO l\u2019a utilement d\u00e9clar\u00e9 dans l\u2019affaire McKay, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e :\n[traduction] L\u2019objectivit\u00e9 d\u2019un expert ne suppose pas que celui-ci n\u2019entretient aucun lien dans la collectivit\u00e9 ou qu\u2019il \u00e9met des opinions dans l\u2019absolu, sans aucunement conna\u00eetre les parties ou leurs avocats. On fait appel aux experts pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment en raison de leur connaissance \u00e9tendue ou approfondie du domaine et de leur bonne r\u00e9putation ou de leur affiliation [...]. De plus, eu \u00e9gard aux droits de la personne, je suis conscient des probl\u00e8mes d\u2019acc\u00e8s \u00e0 la justice que peuvent rencontrer les groupes marginalis\u00e9s et en qu\u00eate d\u2019\u00e9quit\u00e9 si les r\u00e8gles de la preuve sont appliqu\u00e9es de fa\u00e7on stricte dans le but d\u2019exclure tout expert ayant travaill\u00e9 au sein de tels groupes ou en leur nom. Pour \u00e9valuer l\u2019(im)partialit\u00e9, le tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si, compte tenu de la nature et du degr\u00e9 de l\u2019association, l\u2019expert est capable et d\u00e9sireux de fournir une preuve ind\u00e9pendante et objective faisant autorit\u00e9, et non pas des arguments, afin d\u2019aider le d\u00e9cideur, peu importe la partie que l\u2019information fournie favorise (au paragraphe 99).\n[76] Les tribunaux des droits de la personne ont reconnu que les critiques formul\u00e9es par un expert ne constituent pas n\u00e9cessairement un plaidoyer. Dans l\u2019affaire McWilliam, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9e, le TDPO a \u00e9valu\u00e9 l\u2019objectivit\u00e9 de l\u2019experte apr\u00e8s que le d\u00e9fendeur eut fait valoir qu\u2019elle \u00e9tait une militante f\u00e9ministe. Dans cette affaire, le TDPO a d\u00e9clar\u00e9 ceci :\n[traduction] Le fait que la professeure Corsianos ait critiqu\u00e9 le traitement r\u00e9serv\u00e9 aux femmes dans les services de police ne la rend pas, en soi, incapable de fournir une preuve juste, objective et impartiale. Cela ne fait pas non plus d\u2019elle une d\u00e9fenseure partiale. Il est tout \u00e0 fait possible d\u2019\u00eatre critique tout en \u00e9tant juste, objectif et impartial, notamment quand il est l\u00e9gitime de formuler des critiques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes, institutions ou entit\u00e9s sociales \u00e9tudi\u00e9s (au paragraphe 54).\n[77] Selon les plaignants, ce n\u2019est pas parce que M. Milward a formul\u00e9 des critiques \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC qu\u2019il est incapable de fournir une preuve juste, objective et impartiale, ni qu\u2019il est un d\u00e9fenseur partial de la cause. Ils ajoutent que les critiques formul\u00e9es par M. Milward au sujet de la conduite adopt\u00e9e par la GRC \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des peuples autochtones sont fond\u00e9es sur un motif l\u00e9gitime, qu\u2019il explique en d\u00e9tail dans son rapport et qui repose sur des conclusions tir\u00e9es de rapports et d\u2019\u00e9tudes dignes de foi. Plus particuli\u00e8rement, les plaignants soulignent que d\u2019autres d\u00e9cideurs, y compris des tribunaux de juridiction criminelle, se sont appuy\u00e9s sur le rapport final de la Commission de v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et r\u00e9conciliation et sur le rapport final de l\u2019Enqu\u00eate nationale sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es pour \u00e9tablir le contexte social \u00e9tant donn\u00e9 la v\u00e9racit\u00e9 de leur contenu (voir R. v. A.(M.), 2020 NUCJ 4 (CanLII), au paragraphe 19 et Campbell v. Vancouver Police Board (No.4), 2019 BCHRT 275 (CanLII), aux paragraphes 111 et 112).\n[78] Je ne pense pas que la GRC ait r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9montrer qu\u2019il existe un motif r\u00e9aliste de penser que M. Milward ne peut ou ne veut pas s\u2019acquitter de l\u2019obligation qui lui incombe de fournir une preuve impartiale, ind\u00e9pendante et sans parti pris. Comme je l\u2019ai mentionn\u00e9 pr\u00e9c\u00e9demment dans la section sur la \u00ab n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u00bb, le fait que M. Milward s\u2019appuie sur le travail r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par d\u2019autres et l\u2019incorpore au sien ne rend pas son rapport inadmissible.\n[79] \u00c0 mon avis, M. Milward est qualifi\u00e9 pour pr\u00e9senter des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve sur la relation de longue date qui existe entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones au Canada, notamment des \u00e9l\u00e9ments relatifs \u00e0 la m\u00e9fiance, pass\u00e9e et pr\u00e9sente, des peuples autochtones l\u2019\u00e9gard de la GRC, y compris dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique. De par ses \u00e9tudes universitaires et son exp\u00e9rience professionnelle, M. Milward a les connaissances et les comp\u00e9tences sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es n\u00e9cessaires pour passer en revue et critiquer les volumineux rapports mentionn\u00e9s dans son rapport. Je souscris \u00e0 l\u2019opinion des plaignants selon laquelle il poss\u00e8de les connaissances et l\u2019expertise n\u00e9cessaires pour \u00e9valuer la validit\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes de sciences sociales.\nC. Les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels de l\u2019admission de la preuve de M. Milward l\u2019emportent sur les risques\n[80] Comme j\u2019ai conclu que la preuve propos\u00e9e par M. Milward r\u00e9pond aux crit\u00e8res d\u2019admissibilit\u00e9 de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, je passe \u00e0 la deuxi\u00e8me \u00e9tape de l\u2019analyse. \u00c0 l\u2019\u00e9tape o\u00f9 il exerce son r\u00f4le de gardien, le Tribunal doit d\u00e9terminer si les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels de l\u2019admission de la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e l\u2019emportent sur tout risque de pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019instruction ou pour les autres parties. Dans l\u2019arr\u00eat White Burgess, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, la Cour supr\u00eame a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019\u00e0 cette \u00e9tape, la pertinence, la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9, la fiabilit\u00e9 et l\u2019absence de parti pris jouent un r\u00f4le dans la pond\u00e9ration des consid\u00e9rations concurrentes globales relatives \u00e0 l\u2019admissibilit\u00e9. La Cour a indiqu\u00e9 qu\u2019au bout du compte, le juge doit \u00eatre convaincu que les risques li\u00e9s au t\u00e9moignage de l\u2019expert ne l\u2019emportent pas sur l\u2019utilit\u00e9 possible de celui-ci (au paragraphe 54). Parmi les risques possibles, mentionnons une instruction retard\u00e9e ou une audience plus longue, un ajournement, une hausse des co\u00fbts, un degr\u00e9 de d\u00e9f\u00e9rence inappropri\u00e9 envers l\u2019expert, la science de pacotille et les batailles d\u2019experts (White Burgess, au paragraphe 18).\n[81] La GRC soutient que, m\u00eame si le Tribunal estime que le rapport r\u00e9pond \u00e0 tous les crit\u00e8res de l\u2019arr\u00eat Mohan, l\u2019effet combin\u00e9 de toutes les lacunes du rapport rend les dangers de son admission bien plus grands que tout b\u00e9n\u00e9fice qu\u2019il pourrait apporter. Elle affirme que M. Milward fait de vastes g\u00e9n\u00e9ralisations sur les enqu\u00eates men\u00e9es par la GRC dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique tout en admettant qu\u2019il dispose de peu de renseignements lui permettant d\u2019\u00e9valuer la conduite discriminatoire. La GRC fait valoir que la [traduction] \u00ab port\u00e9e excessive \u00bb du rapport, lequel pr\u00e9sente des faits et des opinions sur des sujets tels que les pensionnats et l\u2019enqu\u00eate sur les femmes et les filles autochtones disparues et assassin\u00e9es, ne fait que d\u00e9tourner l\u2019attention de l\u2019all\u00e9gation de discrimination dont est saisi le Tribunal, laquelle porte, selon elle, sur l\u2019enqu\u00eate du caporal Mackie. Elle affirme que [traduction] \u00ab le Tribunal n\u2019est pas appel\u00e9 \u00e0 se prononcer sur l\u2019histoire et la conduite de la GRC depuis sa cr\u00e9ation \u00bb.\n[82] Les plaignants soutiennent que les \u00ab lacunes \u00bb du rapport auxquelles la GRC fait r\u00e9f\u00e9rence sont en fait des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles pour \u00e9tablir le contexte.\n[83] Je reconnais que le rapport traite de sujets qui, \u00e0 premi\u00e8re vue, semblent n\u2019avoir aucun lien avec l\u2019enqu\u00eate discriminatoire dont il est question dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Cependant, je reconnais \u00e9galement que le rapport traite de ces divers sujets parce qu\u2019ils s\u2019inscrivent dans le contexte de la relation entre la GRC et les peuples autochtones au Canada, y compris dans le nord de la Colombie-Britannique. La Cour supr\u00eame du Canada a confirm\u00e9 qu\u2019il est important de comprendre le contexte social entourant les interactions entre la police et les groupes racialis\u00e9s lorsque vient le temps de se prononcer sur les circonstances d\u2019un contact particulier (voir R. c. Le, pr\u00e9cit\u00e9, au paragraphe 86). Je reconnais qu\u2019il est tout aussi important de comprendre le contexte lorsqu\u2019on examine des all\u00e9gations de discrimination, qu\u2019elle soit individuelle ou syst\u00e9mique.\n[84] Je comprends que les plaignants pr\u00e9sentent la preuve de M. Milward afin de situer la relation entre la GRC et les Autochtones dans son contexte historique et racial. Ils affirment que cette preuve est pertinente par rapport au contexte social qui sous-tend leur plainte de discrimination. Je suis d\u2019avis que les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels de cette preuve l\u2019emportent sur tout pr\u00e9judice pour l\u2019instruction. Il ne s\u2019agit pas d\u2019une affaire o\u00f9 la preuve d\u2019expert propos\u00e9e traite d\u2019un sujet que le tribunal des droits de la personne ne conna\u00eet pas du tout. Il n\u2019est donc pas question ici d\u2019admettre une \u00ab science de pacotille \u00bb susceptible de donner lieu \u00e0 une erreur judiciaire. Il n\u2019y a pas non plus de raison de croire que la preuve de M. Milward retardera ind\u00fbment l\u2019instruction ou qu\u2019elle am\u00e8nera un ajournement.\n[85] La GRC soutient \u00e9galement que le rapport lui est enti\u00e8rement pr\u00e9judiciable \u00e0 titre d\u2019intim\u00e9e. Elle affirme que, du fait que le rapport contient la liste des nombreux pr\u00e9judices qui, selon M. Milward, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 caus\u00e9s par la GRC, [traduction] \u00ab il faut en conclure que la GRC a \u00e9galement caus\u00e9 des pr\u00e9judices dans l\u2019affaire qui nous int\u00e9resse \u00bb et que M. Milward se prononce donc sur la question fondamentale que le Tribunal doit trancher. Elle fait valoir qu\u2019il est pr\u00e9judiciable de chercher \u00e0 d\u00e9former les faits de la pr\u00e9sente plainte \u00e0 la lumi\u00e8re des torts all\u00e9gu\u00e9s du pass\u00e9.\n[86] Les plaignants soutiennent qu\u2019un rapport d\u00e9favorable n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessairement un rapport pr\u00e9judiciable. Ils d\u00e9clarent que la preuve de M. Milward ne porte pas sur la question fondamentale de savoir si les pratiques d\u2019enqu\u00eate en cause t\u00e9moignent d\u2019une discrimination individuelle ou syst\u00e9mique \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des Autochtones, ou si d\u2019autres techniques d\u2019enqu\u00eate auraient d\u00fb \u00eatre utilis\u00e9es pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins des plaignants autochtones.\n[87] Je conviens que le simple fait que le rapport de M. Milward contienne des renseignements avec lesquels la GRC pourrait \u00eatre en d\u00e9saccord ne le rend pas n\u00e9cessairement pr\u00e9judiciable. La GRC pourra contre-interroger M. Milward, pr\u00e9senter sa propre preuve et faire des observations sur la pertinence du t\u00e9moignage de M. Milward et le poids qu\u2019il convient de lui accorder.\n[88] En ce qui concerne la pr\u00e9occupation selon laquelle le Tribunal pourrait s\u2019en remettre ind\u00fbment \u00e0 l\u2019opinion de M. Milward, le Tribunal comprend que la preuve d\u2019opinion de M. Milward n\u2019usurpe pas le r\u00f4le qui lui incombe d\u2019\u00e9valuer la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9, de constater les faits et de trancher les questions de fait et de droit soulev\u00e9es dans la pr\u00e9sente plainte. Le Tribunal est bien conscient qu\u2019il doit d\u00e9terminer s\u2019il y a eu discrimination en l\u2019esp\u00e8ce et qu\u2019il d\u00e9cidera, apr\u00e8s avoir entendu l\u2019ensemble de la preuve et des observations des parties, du poids qu\u2019il convient d\u2019accorder, le cas \u00e9ch\u00e9ant, \u00e0 la preuve de M. Milward.\n[89] Je ne crois pas que la GRC ait d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que le risque de pr\u00e9judice pour le processus d\u2019audience ou pour la GRC l\u2019emporte sur les b\u00e9n\u00e9fices \u00e9ventuels de l\u2019admission de la preuve propos\u00e9e par M. Milward. J\u2019estime plut\u00f4t que la preuve attendue est assez avantageuse pour la pr\u00e9sente instance pour justifier son admission et que le risque de pr\u00e9judice est minime. Le rapport de M. Milward est admissible et il peut t\u00e9moigner \u00e0 titre d\u2019expert \u00e0 l\u2019audition de la plainte.\nSign\u00e9e par\nColleen Harrington\nMembre du Tribunal\nOttawa (Ontario)\nLe 7 mars 2023\nTribunal canadien des droits de la personne\nParties au dossier\nDossier du tribunal : T2459\/1620\nIntitul\u00e9 de la cause : Woodgate et al. c.
